Teller (born Raymond Joseph Teller;[1] February 14, 1948)[1] is an American magician, illusionist, actor, comedian, writer, director and usually silent half of the comedy magic duo Penn & Teller, along with Penn Jillette. Teller is an atheist, debunker, skeptic, and a fellow of the Cato Institute (a free market libertarian think tank which also lists his performing partner Penn Jillette as a fellow), an organization featured prominently in the duo's Showtime television series Bullshit!. He has legally changed his name to just "Teller".[2][3]
Teller was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,[1] the son of Irene B. (née Derrickson) and Joseph Teller (1913–2004).[4] His father, who was of Russian Jewish descent, was born in Brooklyn, New York and grew up in Philadelphia. His mother was from a farming family in Delaware; the two met as painters attending art school at Samuel S. Fleisher Art Memorial.[5][6] His mother was Methodist, and Teller was raised as "a sort of half-assed Methodist".[7] He attended Central High School and Amherst College. He taught English and Latin at Lawrence High School in Lawrenceville, New Jersey.[8] He was selected to be a member of the Central High School Hall of Fame in 2001.
Teller began performing with friend Weir Chrisemer as The Othmar Schoeck Society for the Preservation of Weird and Disgusting Music. Teller met Penn Jillette in 1974, and they became a three-person act with Chrisemer called Asparagus Valley Cultural Society, which played in San Francisco. In 1981, they began performing exclusively together as "Penn & Teller", an act that continues to this day. On April 5, 2013 Penn and Teller were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the live performance category. Their star, the 2,494th awarded, is near the star dedicated to Harry Houdini.[9] The following day they were recognized by the Magic Castle with the "Magicians of the Year" award.[9]
Teller almost never speaks while performing, although there are occasional exceptions, usually when the audience is not aware of it. For example, he provided the voice of "Mofo the psychic gorilla" in their early Broadway show with the help of a radio microphone cupped in his hand. Teller's trademark silence originated during his youth, when he earned a living performing magic at college fraternity parties.[10] He found that if he maintained silence throughout his act, spectators refrained from throwing beer and heckling him and focused more on his performance.
Other exceptions to his silent act include instances in which his face is covered or obscured, as when he spoke while covered with a plastic sheet in the series premiere of Penn & Teller: Bullshit!,[11] and when he was interviewed while in shadow for the 2010 History Channel documentary, Houdini: Unlocking the Mystery,[12] while Teller spoke at length in an NPR story on Houdini in 2010.[13] He was also interviewed, with his mouth obscured in shadow, in the Nova ScienceNow episode "How Does the Brain Work?". Teller appears to have said "Science" in a high-pitched voice in Penn and Teller's appearance on the television show Bill Nye the Science Guy, episode "Light Optics", but in fact he only mouthed the word while Penn used a ventriloquist technique to make it sound as if Teller had spoken while keeping his own mouth from moving. Penn and Teller appear as comedians Rebo and Zooty in the 5th season episode of Babylon 5, "The Day of the Dead", written by Neil Gaiman. Teller also spoke in his 1987 appearance on NBC's Miami Vice (a fourth-season episode titled "Like a Hurricane"),[14] and had speaking parts in the movies Penn & Teller Get Killed (he speaks in the final scene), Long Gone and The Aristocrats. He gave voice to an animated version of himself in two episodes of The Simpsons ("Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder" and "The Great Simpsina"), and voiced a series of cloned store clerks in "Zoey's Zoo", an episode of Oh Yeah! Cartoons, as well as the English version of the 1988 animated feature Light Years (original French title: Gandahar), where he was the voice of Octum. Teller speaks at length about magic performance and sleight-of-hand in the documentary "Penn & Teller's Magic and Mystery Tour". Teller has been shown screaming and swearing in the "Anger Management" episode of Penn & Teller: Bullshit!. More recently, Teller had a brief speaking part in Atlas Shrugged: Part II, where he advises Dagny Taggart (played by Samantha Mathis) to go out the side door of the Taggart Transcontinental offices.
Teller did break his silence in his portrayal of Mortimer in the 1995 film version of The Fantasticks, though almost all of his dialogue was edited out of the film's final version (his "Dying isn't easy" scene is included among deleted scenes on the DVD release). He also appeared as a "cat" in the Dharma & Greg season 1 episode "The Cat's out of the Bag". He also appeared in an episode of Tosh.O giving "advice" to a fellow magician. He stood staring at the gentleman for several seconds before uttering "Practice once in a fuckin' while" while walking away. He also spoke at length during an interview on the Charlie Rose television program on 27 January 2014.
Teller co-directed a version of Macbeth[15] which incorporated stage magic techniques in the scenes with the Three Witches.
Teller's voice can be heard on Season 13 of Celebrity Apprentice, "Episode 10: The Mayor of Stress Town", when speaking with contestant Penn Jillette over Penn's mobile device.
He collaborated with Jillette on three magic books, and he is also the author of "When I'm Dead All This Will Be Yours!": Joe Teller – A Portrait by His Kid (2000), a biography/memoir of his father. The book features his father's paintings and cartoons which were strongly influenced by George Lichty's Grin and Bear It. The book was favorably reviewed by Publishers Weekly:
When Teller, the quiet half of the Penn and Teller showbiz team, made one of his monthly Philadelphia visits to see his parents, Joe and Irene ("Pad" and "Mam"), he was shown 100 unpublished cartoons his father drew in 1939. These "wryly observed scenes of Philadelphia street life," as Teller describes them, are in a loose, sketchy style imitative of the great George Lichty (1905–1983), famed for his long-run syndicated Grin and Bear It. Teller and his father's "memories began to pump and the stories flowed" after they opened boxes of old letters that Teller read out loud (learning for the first time about a period in his parents' lives that he knew nothing about, such as the fact that his father's name is really Israel Max Teller). Joe's Depression-era hobo adventures led to travels throughout the U.S., Canada and Alaska, and by 1933, he returned to Philadelphia for art study. After Joe and Irene met during evening art classes, they married, and Joe worked half-days as a Philadelphia Inquirer copy boy. When the Inquirer rejected his cartoons, he moved into advertising art just as World War II began. Employing excerpts from letters and postcards, Teller successfully re-creates the world of his parents in a relaxed writing style of light humor and easy (yet highly effective) transitions between the past and present.[17]
Teller is a coauthor of the Nature Reviews Neuroscience paper "Attention and awareness in stage magic: turning tricks into research" from the November 2008 issue.[18]
In 2010, Teller wrote Play Dead,[19] a "throwback to the spook shows of the 1930s and ’40s" that ran September 12–24 in Las Vegas before opening Off Broadway in New York. The show stars sideshow performer and magician Todd Robbins.[20]
Teller directed a feature film documentary, Tim's Vermeer, which is set for release in 2014.[21][22][23][24][25] He and Penn served as executive producers, with distribution by Sony Pictures Classics.[26]

          Teller was born on February 14, 1948 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA as Raymond Joseph Teller. He is a producer and writer, known for Penn & Teller: Bullshit! (2003), Fantasia/2000 (1999) and Sin City Spectacular (1998).
      Teller taught Latin at a high school near Trenton, NJ. He graduated from Amherst College in Amherst, MA. He went to Central High School in Philadelphia, PA.
      Changed his name to Teller legally, and has one of the few US passports issued with a single name.
      Despite his trademark of never speaking, Teller has appeared in speaking roles in several films and television shows, including The Learning Channel's "Mysteries of Magic," in which he appeared for an interview, as himself, without stage partner Penn Jillette.
      His green room at the Rio All-Suites Hotel and Casino was redone by Penn Jillette and the crew from the show "While You Were Out" on TLC.
      He and stage partner Penn were contestants on an episode of celebrity Fear Factor (2001). Teller performed all of the stunts while Penn was left out of the action. In the end, the duo was beaten by Keshia Knight Pulliam.
      On his guest appearance on "The Simpsons" he spoke five lines, a rarity for this usually silent actor.
      He spoke in his role on Atlas Shrugged II when he said, "Miss Taggart, maybe you should take the side door. It's getting pretty dicey outside.".
      Hosting the TV-show "Penn and Tellers: Bullshit!" with Penn Jillette, which reached season 6. [July 2008]
      Magic is the art of creating false (but funny or beautiful) cause-and-effect relationships. That's our area of expertise. When we do it on a stage, the audience is fooled, but only for the moment, only in the theater. They know they're watching a show. They know it's all tricks. They do not go home and try to float in the air or catch bullets in their teeth. [But] When we see scam artists peddling false cause-and-effect as reality; when we see the tools of theater and poetry used to victimize the vulnerable; when we sick people submitting to "medical procedures" that belong in a Three Stooges movie; all this enrages us.
      If there existed even one psychic who had predicted that disaster, we'd be very, very interested. But, nope. What haunts me about 9/11 is the horrible knowledge that those who did the deed did it to further the divine will. Whenever we hear a politician bless killing, we should think twice.

 Jillette Penn was born on March 5, 1955, in Greenfield, Massachusetts. Teller  was born on February 14, 1948, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The two had started working together in the 1970s  and first came into public notice as part of an act called "Asparagus Valley Cultural Society;" a show show featuring their talents had a very long run in San Francisco. Moving to New York, the two scored their first big hit with their off-Broadway show, "Penn & Teller Go Public" in 1985. Their show was a instant hit and ran for more than a year.They performed mind-boggling tricks while blending humor and turning the traditional magic show inside out. In 1989, the magic duo appeared in their first feature film entitled "Penn & Teller Get Killed."Penn & Teller also graced the television world; they have appeared on "Late Night with Conan O’Brien," "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno," and "Late Night with David Letterman." They even voiced animated versions of themselves for the hit series The Simpsons.Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, Penn & Teller appeared in their own television specials—including Don’t Try This at Home!

TellerAKA Raymond Joseph TellerBorn: 14-Feb-1948Birthplace: Philadelphia, PAGender: MaleReligion: AtheistRace or Ethnicity: WhiteOccupation: MagicianNationality: United StatesExecutive summary: The nonspeaking half of Penn and TellerHe was born Raymond Joseph Teller, but even when he was teaching high school, he asked students to call him Teller, never Mr. Teller. He has legally changed his name to just plain Teller, and holds a US passport issued without listing a first name.
He is the silent half of Penn and Teller, and the most famous professional mute since Harpo Marx. He began performing illusions of magic when he was five, after sending for a magic kit he had seen advertised on Howdy Doody. Magic was his hobby all through high school and college, but then he settled down with what seemed to be a responsible career as a high school teacher.
At the age of 27 Teller taught his last class, quitting to perform illusions on street corners, at renaissance fairs, and anywhere else there was a little money to be made. He gradually stopped speaking on stage when he noticed that the less he spoke, the more the audience seemed to pay attention.
Early in his career, Teller teamed with a musician, Wier Chrisemer, billing themselves as The Ottmar Scheckt Society for the Preservation of Weird and Disgusting Music. Teller and Penn met in 1975, and the act became a trio renamed the Asparagus Valley Cultural Society. Chrisemer played the synthesizer, Teller performed illusions, and Penn juggled, but their schtick had no outrageous edge because Chrisemer was devoutly Christian, the son of a Lutheran minister, and vetoed anything too risqué. Not surprisingly, Penn and Teller became a duo, the better to shock, offend, and entertain.
Penn & Teller first caught national attention in 1985, with a special on PBS. They appeared on Saturday Night Live in 1986, and debuted on Broadway in 1987. When they first appeared on Late Night with David Letterman, the host told them during a commercial break to surprise him with something, anything, on their next appearance -- the wilder the better. It was Teller's idea to bring hundreds of cockroaches and release them on Letterman's desk.
In their act, Teller usually has the more difficult assignment. He wears a straightjacket, hangs upside-down over a bed of nails, is run over by an 18-wheel truck, has knives driven through his hands, is immersed in an enormous water tank, and swings over bear traps on a trapeze. On their series Bullshit!, they have debunked psychics, paranormal frauds, cults, mainstream religion, and the war on drugs. Penn, of course, does virtually all the talking.
When working as an actor, Teller sometimes speaks. He spoke on an episode of Dharma & Greg, and shouted "Yes!" when a competitor fell while filming an episode of Fear Factor. Teller also spoke but did not sing in the movie musical The Fantasticks, and he had several lines of dialogue in their 1989 movie, Penn & Teller Get Killed.

Edward Teller was born into an affluent, educated Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary. As one of the great cities of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Budapest was part of a larger central European world of predominantly German language and culture. Edward was only ten when the First World War brought an end to the Empire and Hungary became independent for the first time in centuries.
Young Edward was a mathematical prodigy, educated in private schools, but his education was frequently disrupted by the political turmoil engulfing the new nation. In 1926, Edward left Budapest to study chemical engineering in Karlsruhe, Germany.
In Karlsruhe, Teller became intrigued by physics, particularly the new theory of quantum mechanics.  The young chemical engineer transferred to the University of Munich in 1928 to pursue this interest. In Munich, disaster struck. A streetcar accident cost Teller his right foot.
Once Teller had recovered from his injury and learned to walk with a prosthesis, he transferred to the University of Leipzig to study with Werner Heisenberg, who was in the forefront of the new physics.  Teller received his doctorate in physics in 1930 and took a job as research consultant at the University of Göttingen.  His first published paper, "Hydrogen Molecular Ion," was one of the earliest statements of what is still the most widely held view of the molecule.
Teller might have settled down to a long, productive career in Germany, but again political events intervened.  Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany and Teller knew immediately that there was no future for him in Germany.  With the help of the tight-knit community of advanced physicists, Teller was able to emigrate to Denmark in 1934.  There he joined the Institute for Theoretical Physics, where the great Niels Bohr led a team of young scientists attempting to unlock the secrets of the atom.  In this year, Teller married Augusta Harkanyi, a marriage that weathered half a century of expatriation and controversy.
At Bohr's institute, Teller met the Russian physicist George Gamow, also a political refugee.  After a year, Gamow and Teller went their separate ways.  Gamow headed for George Washington University in Washington, D.C., while Teller headed for England. He worked briefly at the University of London, but within a year received an invitation to join Gamow in Washington. Teller gratefully accepted the offer and entered the United States in 1935; he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1941.
In Washington, Teller and Gamow worked together closely, formulating the so-called Gamow-Teller rules for classifying subatomic particle behavior in radioactive decay.  They also attempted to apply the new understanding of atomic phenomena to astrophysics. Teller had settled down to what he hoped would be a quiet academic life, but events in Europe intervened again.
The development of nuclear physics had continued at a slower pace in Hitler's Germany, but by 1939, German scientists had discovered nuclear fission.  It was theoretically possible to split the atom, releasing energy as heat.  It appeared to Teller and the other refugee physicists that the most destructive force ever known to man might fall into the hands of Adolf Hitler. Their fear was amplified by the knowledge that the German nuclear program was led by Heisenberg himself.
Teller's friend Leo Szilard enlisted Albert Einstein to bring this danger to the attention of President Franklin Roosevelt.  Roosevelt appealed to the scientific community to mobilize for the defense of freedom. In 1941 Teller joined America's best physicists in the top secret Manhattan Project.  Their mission: to develop the atom bomb before the Germans did.
After preliminary work in Chicago with Enrico Fermi, and in Berkeley with J. Robert Oppenheimer, Teller moved to the isolated laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Here, under Oppenheimer's leadership, the first atomic bomb would be built.
As early as 1940, Teller had considered the possibility of using the intense heat generated by nuclear fission to trigger the process called nuclear fusion, an even more explosive phenomenon.  Teller hoped that both the fission and fusion options would be pursued at Los Alamos, but building the simpler fission device alone proved so complicated that fusion research was abandoned.  Teller was deeply disappointed.
Edward Teller made a major contribution to the development of the atomic bomb. From the beginning, some scientists had feared that an uncontrolled nuclear reaction, like that of the proposed bomb, might continue indefinitely, consuming the earth. Teller's calculations reassured the team that the nuclear explosion, while enormously powerful, would only destroy a limited area.
In 1945, the atom bomb was successfully tested at Alamogordo, New Mexico. The German project was nowhere near completion when Germany surrendered. Within weeks of the first test, America's bombs had destroyed the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Japan surrendered and the war was over.  Once the war was over, Teller tried again, without success, to persuade his superiors at Los Alamos to pursue fusion and create a thermonuclear weapon vastly more powerful than the bombs dropped on Japan.
When the Russians detonated their own atomic bomb, President Harry S. Truman ordered the Los Alamos lab to develop a fusion weapon. In 1952, the first hydrogen bomb was successfully detonated on Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. Teller felt vindicated, but Oppenheimer and many of the Manhattan Project veterans had opposed the plan. A deep and bitter rift developed between two factions of atomic scientists.
Teller believed the scientists at Los Alamos were too ambivalent about developing the next generation of nuclear weapons, and that an independent facility was needed. He lobbied Congress and the armed services vigorously for the establishment of a second laboratory for thermonuclear research. The Atomic Energy Commission responded by establishing the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in northern California. Teller served in succession as consultant, associate director and finally director of the Livermore lab.
A deeper antagonism between Teller and many  of his former colleagues developed when J. Robert Oppenheimer was accused of disloyalty on the basis of some past associations.  Teller made no accusations himself, but when Oppenheimer's security clearance was revoked, many  of his friends blamed Teller.
Over the years, Teller continued to advocate a strong national defense.  He made headlines in the 1970s, promoting the development of nuclear fusion as an alternative to other sources of energy, and again in the 1980s, testifying in favor of the strategic missile defense system.  He was the author of over a dozen books, mostly dealing with nuclear energy and defense issues. From 1975, Edward Teller was a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institute for the Study of War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. He died at his home on the University campus at the age of 95.

=======================================================
Edward Teller was born on January 15, 1908, in Budapest, Austria-Hungary. He left his homeland in 1926 and received his higher education in Germany. As a young student, he was involved in a streetcar accident that severed his leg, requiring him to wear a prosthetic foot and leaving him with a life-long limp. Teller graduated with a degree in chemical engineering at the University of Karlsruhe and received his Ph.D. in physics under Werner Heisenberg in 1930 at the University of Leipzig; his doctoral dissertation dealt with one of the first accurate quantum mechanical treatments of the hydrogen molecular ion. That same year, he made friends with young Russian physicists George Gamow and Lev Landau, who then visited Western Europe.
Teller spent two years at the University of Göttingen and left Germany in 1934 through the aid of the Jewish Rescue Committee. He went briefly to England and moved for a year to Copenhagen, where he worked under Niels Bohr. In February 1934, he married "Mici" (Augusta Maria) Harkanyi, the sister of a longtime friend.
In 1935, Teller was invited to the U.S. to become a Professor of Physics at the George Washington Universitiy, where he worked with Gamow until 1941. He was engaged as a theoretical physicist, working in the fields of quantum, molecular and nuclear physics. In 1941, after becoming a naturalized citizen of the U.S., his interest turned to the use of nuclear energy, both fission and fusion.
Perhaps the most important contribution by Teller was the elucidation of the Jahn-Teller Effect (1939), which describes the geometrical distortion that electron clouds undergo in certain situations; this plays prominently in the description of chemical reactions of metals, and in particular the coloration of certain metallic dyes. In collaboration with Brunauer and Emmett, Teller also made an important contribution to surface physics and chemistry: the so-called Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) isotherm.
In 1942, Teller was invited to be part of Robert Oppenheimer's summer planning seminar at UC Berkeley for the origins of the Manhattan Project. He first worked with Leo Szilard at the University of Chicago, and in 1943, he headed a group at Los Alamos in the Theoretical Physics division. However, his obsession with the H-bomb caused tensions with other scientists, particularly Hans Bethe, the division leader.
Teller left Los Alamos in 1946, returning to the University of Chicago. But when the Soviet Union conducted its first test of an atomic device in August 1949, he did his best to drum up support for a crash program to build a hydrogen bomb. When he and mathematician Stanislaw Ulam finally came up with an H-bomb design that would work, Teller was not chosen to head the project. He left Los Alamos and soon joined the newly established Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a rival nuclear-weapons lab in California.
It was during Oppenheimer's security clearance hearings in 1954 that the final rift occurred between Teller and many of his scientific colleagues. At the hearings, Teller testified, "I feel I would prefer to see the vital interests of this country in hands that I understand better and therefore trust more."
Teller continued to be a tireless advocate of a strong defense policy, calling for the development of advanced thermonuclear weapons and continued nuclear testing. He was a vigorous proponent of an anti-ballistic missile shield. He was appointed Director Emeritus at the Livermore laboratory and senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution, positions that he held until his death. Teller received numerous awards during his career, including the prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded to him in 2003 by President Bush.

Juergen Teller is a renown German photographer who immigrated to England in the 1980s and is today based in London. His work has been focused equally in the fashion world as in the domain of music. Over the years he has worked alongside great personalities such as, for example, in the fashion houses like Yves Saint Laurent for which he has directed advertising campaigns, or for famous singers. He is widely recognized as one of the most popular contemporary fashion photographers in spite of his bad boy reputation in the world of fashion. 
Juergen Teller was born in 1964 in Erlangen, Germany. There he followed two years of photo courses, from 1984 to 1986 at the Fotodesign Academy of Munich (the Bayerische Staatslehranstalt für Photographie). In order to avoid military national service he would learn English and move to London at the age of 22. In 1986 he would begin his career photographing celebrities from the world of music such as, notably, Elton John. 
Although he would not know anything about the world of fashion at the time, he would begin working for fashion magazines for young people such as Face, W Magazine, i-D, Dazed & Confused, and All the vogues. But quickly also for other fashion magazines such as Vogue. Still in the world of fashion, he would eventually orient himself towards high fashion, working for fashion houses, making ad campaigns not only for Yves Saint Laurent products (since 2005) but also Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs and many others. He would eventually photograph famous models such as Kate Moss,but also Claudia Schiffer, Stephanie Seymour, Winona Ryder and others. Teller would also work on music album covers of singers such as Björk, Sinead O'Connor, and Elton John, as well as for bands like Elastica, Simply Red, New Order, songwriter DJ Shadow, and others. 
He would first show his talent by exhibiting his work in different countries on a permanent basis and would receive as a result numerous awards for his art, including the 1993 photography prize at the fashion festival in Monaco. Ten years later in 2003 he would also receive the Citibank photography bank. Juergen Teller would become famous in the world of fashion by daring to show through his work strongly anti-glamour shots. Indeed, instead of worshiping the models and make them look through photographic tricks even more sublime than they actually are, Teller dares to emphasize their so-called imperfections and human weaknesses such as wrinkles and even messy or typically unwanted hair. He is known for giving the same treatment to celebrities as well. Indeed, whether it be Yves Saint-Laurent, the English actress Charlotte Rampling or the French actress Isabelle Huppert, he does not try to flatter but to be true, as he puts it himself. 
Similarly, Tellers small-format portrait of the famous photographer William Eggleston would surprise by its apparent banality. Crouched in a work armchair, a drink and a cigarette in hand, the man who almost single-handedly popularized color photography in the 1970s is treated the same way as Tellers aunt, Elfriede, sitting on a couch, hung up on the wall two frames over next to a large portrait of Kate Moss. 
Juergen Teller claims above all the influence of Lee Friedlander, the American photographer known for his black and white pictures that made of the modern city purposefully not a particularly picturesque scene by including, for instance, elements such as street signs, windows and posts. This abundance of elements and unconventional framings brings about an intended confusion to Friedlanders images, often revealing both the alienation and complexity of modern life.
Unlike Friedlander, Teller prefers to work in color. His quest for honesty is reflected in a frank look through intimate and mundane subject matters such as the portrait of his daughter next to a vase, or, again, that of his aunt, or also the castle New Schwantein, center of Bavarian tourism, which all characterize his absolute refusal of conventional stereotypes of beauty. 
Teller falls in the tradition of documentary photography and of direct aesthetics of straight photography, which is known for its as pure as possible rendition of a scene in that it strives to be realistic and objective. Similarly, his amateur framings which include deliberate mistakes such as flash reflections or  everyday life subjects in simple poses, all contribute to a kind of aesthetics of failure that capture attention because of the banality displayed. Yet we should not be fooled from a first impression, for Teller points out that his images are never actually taken accidentally, but always the result of thoughtful planning and precise staging. 
Jurgen Teller therefore positions himself far from polished photography and conventional beauty. He is one of those who, since 1990, has contributed to the reinvention of fashion photography. The Museum of Modern Art (MoMa) in Queens, NY would recognize and reward his talent for innovation in presenting his work in the important group exhibition entitled Fashioning Fiction in Photography Since 1990 (Summer 2004). There, Tellers work would be presented along with that of other important photographers such as Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman, Philip Lorca diCorcia, Cedric Buchet, Glen Luchford, Larry Sultan Ellen von Unweth and Tina Barney. 
In his exhibition entitled Do You Know What I Mean (2006), he offers a mixture of personal and professional work as well as images of celebrity people and more intimate matters. In this way, here as well as elsewhere individual and collective memories are mixed. For example, images in the series entitled Nürnberg (2004-2005), which means Nuremberg in English, consists of still lifes as well as small fragile plants, which in places are covered with snow and in others are bathed in sunshine, all of which stand out on a wall of dull gray concrete. These images are taken in the Zeppelintribüne, former meeting place of the Nazis under Hitlers regime. 
The history of Germany, his country of origin, would indeed all along be a heavy burden to bear for Juergen Teller. His return at this cursed place in a city that was razed to the ground at the end of World War II is a way for him to not only commemorate the horrors of the past but also to celebrate the life force that remains in spite of it all.  
Albrecht Dürers Great Piece of Turf (1501), a painting by the painter of Nuremberg is therefore transposed by a young and uprooted cosmopolitan in search of truth in our modern society, also in search for closure and meaning, in facing his personal story as well, such as his alcoholic father who would commit suicide in 1989. Jurgen Teler and the designer and art director Venetia Scott would have a little girl from a brief involvement. Moreover with the birth of his son, Teller would seem to have been inspired to a return on his own childhood in his work. With a subtler look, perhaps a more mature one, than at the time when he had made a nude self-portrait, which portrayed him with a can of beer in his hand and his foot on the grave of his father.    
At first glance, the Do You Know What I Mean photographs may at best cause boredom, and at worst irritation or misunderstanding. Faced with the many family portraits where his son occupies a prominent place among the 59 pictures presented, together with the self-portraits in which Teller shows off his manhood with the same candor as the rest of his naked body, one may wonder how such narcissistic navel-gazing could be a great show, and ultimately bring one to ask oneself How is this art?. However by taking the time to get out of our own listless mind, looking at the pictures again, many come to grasp what the artist is telling us through the images. Starting with the title of the exhibition, Do You Know What Mean, which while thought-provoking, does not give a clear answer. Without taking the time one may risk missing out on a work renown for its great sensitivity, which reflects with a discreet subtlety something of life at the beginning of the third millennium: cosmopolitan, complex, and indeed fragility.   
Teller has also directed several short films including Can I Own Myself in 1998 in which he also appears Kate Moss. More recently he would slow down the pace of his work, preferring to focus on his family more. 
Juergen Teller is a Professor of Fashion Media at the European Graduate School where he teaches an Intensive Summer Seminar in Saas-Fee, Switzerland.
