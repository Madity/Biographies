Robert Douglas Thomas Pattinson[2][3] (born 13 May 1986)[4] is an English actor, model, musician and producer.[5] Pattinson started his career by playing Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.[6] He later landed the leading role of vampire Edward Cullen in the film adaptations of the Twilight novels by Stephenie Meyer, and came to worldwide fame,[7][8] thus establishing himself among the highest paid and most bankable actors in Hollywood.[9][10][11] In 2010, Pattinson was named one of TIME magazine's 100 Most Influential People in The World, and also in the same year Forbes ranked him as one of the most powerful celebrities in the world in the Forbes Celebrity 100.[12][13]
In 2009, he portrayed Salvador Dalí in Little Ashes. In the same year, a documentary film entitled Robsessed about his fame and popularity was released. He appeared as a troubled young man in Remember Me (2010) and also starred in romantic drama Water for Elephants (2011). His performance as a tough, cold hearted and calculating billionaire in David Cronenberg's Cosmopolis (2012), earned him critical praise. He further gained critical appreciation for his performances in David Michod's futuristic western The Rover and in Cronenberg's satire drama Maps to the Stars (both 2014). He will appear in Werner Herzog's biopic film Queen of the Desert, in Anton Corbijn's Life, in Olivier Assayas's Idol’s Eye and in James Gray's The Lost City of Z.
Pattinson plays and compose his own music and had sung songs for his films in the Twilight film series and How to Be. He is a supporter of ECPAT, Parents and Abducted Children Together (PACT), GO Campaign and member of International Medical Corps and has promoted and shared details about cancer through Public service announcements to raise awareness about the disease.
Pattinson was born in London, England. His father, Richard, imported vintage cars from America, and his mother, Clare, worked for a modelling agency.[14] Pattinson has two elder sisters, singer Lizzy Pattinson, and Victoria Pattinson.[15][16] He was raised as a Roman Catholic.[17] Growing up in the Barnes suburb of London,[18] he attended Tower House School until he was 12, and then The Harrodian School.[19][20] He became involved in amateur theatre at the Barnes Theatre Company. He auditioned and was cast in a small role in Guys and Dolls. He next auditioned for Thornton Wilder's Our Town and was cast as George Gibbs. He also played in Anything Goes and Macbeth.[21] He caught the attention of an acting agent in a production of Tess of the d'Urbervilles and began looking for professional roles.
Pattinson began modelling at the age of 12, but his workload began to decrease four years later. In December 2008, he blamed the lack of modelling work on his masculine appearance: "When I first started I was quite tall and looked like a girl, so I got lots of jobs, because it was during that period where the androgynous look was cool. Then, I guess, I became too much of a guy, so I never got any more jobs. I had the most unsuccessful modelling career."[22] Pattinson appeared in the advertising campaign for Hackett's autumn 2007 collection.[23]
In June 2013, Pattinson was announced as the new face of Dior Homme fragrance[24][25][26] and featured in the advertising campaign titled 1000 LIVES, directed by Romain Gavras and photographed by Nan Goldin. This campaign has also featured the track Whole Lotta Love by English rock band Led Zeppelin.[27][28][29] Goldin, later released a book titled Robert Pattinson: 1000 Lives, collection of Pattinson's images from the campaign.[30][31]
Pattinson had supporting roles in the made for television film Ring of the Nibelungs in 2004 and in director Mira Nair's Vanity Fair, although his scenes in the latter were deleted and only appear on the DVD version.[32][33] In May 2005, he was scheduled to appear in the UK premiere of The Woman Before at the Royal Court Theatre, but was fired shortly before the opening night and was replaced by Tom Riley.[34] Later that year he played Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. For this role he was named that year's "British Star of Tomorrow" by The Times[35] and had more than once been hailed as "the next Jude Law".[20][36][37]
In 2006, Pattinson appeared in The Haunted Airman a psychological thriller, aired on BBC Four on 31 October, he earned favourable reviews.[38][39][40] The Stage praised his performance by saying that "(he) played the airman of the title with a perfect combination of youthful terror and world weary cynicism."[41] On 19 February 2007, he appeared in a supporting role in a one-off television drama based on the best-selling novel by Kate Long The Bad Mother's Handbook.[42][43]
In 2008, Pattinson landed the coveted role of Edward Cullen in the film Twilight, based on Stephenie Meyer's best-selling novel of the same name. According to TV Guide, Pattinson was initially apprehensive about auditioning for the role of Edward Cullen, fearful that he would not be able to live up to the "perfection" expected from the character.[44] The film was released on 21 November 2008 and turned Pattinson into a moviestar overnight.[45] Though the film received mixed reviews, critics praised his and co-star Kristen Stewart's chemistry in the film.[46] The New York Times called Pattinson a "capable and exotically beautiful" actor[47] and Roger Ebert said he was "well-chosen" for the role.[48]
His other release of 2008, How to Be, was a low-budget comedy drama film written and directed by Oliver Irving.[49][50] It screened at number of film festivals, earned mixed reviews from critics.[51][52] Pattinson then starred as Salvador Dalí in the film Little Ashes, a Spanish-British drama directed by Paul Morrison.[53] He also starred in a short film The Summer House directed by Daisy Gili.[54] This short film later re-released as a part of an anthology film titled Love & Distrust, comprising 5 short films following eight individuals from diverse backgrounds on their quest for true contentment.[55][56]
He reprised his role as Edward Cullen in the Twilight sequel The Twilight Saga: New Moon, which was released on 20 November 2009. The film earned a record-breaking $142,839,137 opening weekend and an overall run of $709,827,462 worldwide.[57] Though the film received negative reviews, film critic Michael Phillips from the Chicago Tribune said that Pattinson was still "interesting to watch" despite the bad makeup.[58] Bill GoodyKoontz from the Arizona Republic said that "Pattinson's actually not in the film that much, but he does his best when he's around"[59] and Michael O'Sullivan of the Washington Post noted that his acting was "uniformly strong".[60]
In 2009, Pattinson presented at the 81st Academy Awards.[61] On 10 November 2009, Revolver Entertainment released the DVD Robsessed, a documentary which details Pattinson's life and popularity.[62] His next film The Twilight Saga: Eclipse was released on 30 June 2010, earning $698,491,347 worldwide.[63][64] The film received mixed reviews, Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised Pattinson's performance, stating that "(he) makes you forget the white makeup and weird eye contact lenses – to focus on a character torn between his love for the human Bella (Stewart) and the knowledge that she'll have to let go of her beating heart if she's to stay with him forever."[65] Will Lawrence of Empire Online praised the performance of three leads of the film by saying that "All three corners of the love triangle look sharper than before: the most accomplished actor, Stewart, still lip-biting, Lautner still pec-flexing, and Pattinson not fully shaking that fiery-eyed pout. But all have grown into their roles, cutting loose in a film that (thankfully) sidesteps the melodrama of its prequels."[66]
Pattinson executively produced and starred in the film Remember Me, which was released on 12 March 2010.[67] Though the film received mixed reviews, some critics praised his performance. Jake Coyle of The Associated Press said that "The young actor has an unmistakable screen presence. However in Remember Me, he pours it on thickly and self-consciously. With low eyes, sleeves rolled up just so and cigarette drooping artfully from his mouth, Tyler (like Edward Cullen) is a reluctant romantic."[68] Ian Nathan of Empire Online stated that "this is the best thing he's done."[69] and Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised his and co-star Emilie de Ravin's chemistry in the film, stating the "scenes between Pattinson and de Ravin exude genuine charm."[70]
In 2011, he starred as Jacob Jankowski in Water for Elephants, a film adaptation of the Sara Gruen novel of the same name.[71] The film received mixed reviews, but Pattinson's performance was praised. Film critic Richard Corliss from Time praised Pattinson for being "shy and watchful" and said that he "radiates a slow magnetism that locks the viewer's eyes on him", ultimately calling him "star quality".[72] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle stated that Pattinson succeeded at holding his own at the center of a major feature and was "endlessly watchable".[73] Peter Travers of the Rolling Stone said he "smolders" in the film[74] and Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said that "Pattinson is entirely convincing as Jacob".[75]
Pattinson reappeared as Edward Cullen in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1, which was released on 18 November 2011 and earned $705,058,657 at the box office.[76] He played Georges Duroy in a film adaptation of the 1885 novel Bel Ami, and the film had a world premiere at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival.[77] It was released on 12 February 2012.[78]
Pattinson starred in the film adaptation of Don DeLillo's Cosmopolis, directed by David Cronenberg.[79] The film competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.[80][81] Though the film was well received, Pattinson's performance was praised. Justin Chang of Variety wrote, "An eerily precise match of filmmaker and material, Cosmopolis probes the soullessness of the 1% with the cinematic equivalent of latex gloves. ... Pattinson's excellent performance reps an indispensable asset."[82] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph stated that it is a sensational performance from Robert Pattinson, "yes, that Robert Pattinson – as Packer. Pattinson plays him like a human caldera; stony on the surface, with volcanic chambers of nervous energy and self-loathing churning deep below."[83] And Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly stated, "Pattinson, pale and predatory even without his pasty-white vampire makeup, delivers his frigid pensées with rhythmic confidence."[84]
Pattinson one last time appeared as Edward Cullen in the final instalment of Twilight saga, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 which was released on 16 November 2012, and has grossed over $829 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of the Twilight series.[85][86] In late 2013, he appeared in a black and white short film with model Camille Rowe, as the new face of Dior Homme Fragrances.[87][88]
In May 2014, two of Pattinson's film had their premieres at 2014 Cannes Film Festival.[89] First, Pattinson starred in David Michod's futuristic western The Rover, alongside Guy Pearce and Scoot McNairy.[90][91] The film had its premiere out of competition at the festival.[92] For his performance of a naive simpleton member of the criminal gang, Pattinson received rave reviews. Scott Foundas of Variety said that "Pattinson who turns out to be the film's greatest surprise, sporting a convincing Southern accent and bringing an understated dignity to a role that might easily have been milked for cheap sentimental effects." He further added that "(it is) a career re-defining performance for Pattinson that reveals untold depths of sensitivity and feeling."[93] Todd McCarthy, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, wrote that "Pattinson delivers a performance that, despite the character’s own limitations, becomes more interesting as the film moves along."[94] Jessica Kiang in her review for The Playlist, noted that "(Pattinson) turns in a performance that manages to be more affecting than affected."[95]
Next, he reunited with Cronenberg for the second time in Maps to the Stars, a satire drama described as a darkly comic look at Hollywood excess.[96][97] The film competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.[98] In the film, he played the role of Jerome Fontana, a limo driver and struggling actor, who wants to be a successful screenwriter.[99] Pattinson received favourable reviews for his performance, which Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph described as "winningly played."[100]
Pattinson has also joined the cast of Werner Herzog's adaptation of Gertrude Bell's biopic film Queen of the Desert as T. E. Lawrence and will appear alongside Nicole Kidman and James Franco.[101][102][103] In September 2013, he joined the cast of Anton Corbijn's Life as Life magazine photographer Dennis Stock about the friendship between James Dean and Stock, filming began on 18 February 2014 in Toronto.[104][105][106][107]
He will star alongside Carey Mulligan in James Marsh's Hold On to Me, with filming slated to start in September 2014.[108][109][110][111] In November 2013, he joined the previously cast Benedict Cumberbatch in Paramount Pictures and Plan B Entertainment's adaptation of the best-selling book The Lost City of Z to be directed by James Gray.[112][113] In addition, he is re-teaming with his Cosmopolis co-star Juliette Binoche in Brady Corbet's directorial debut film The Childhood of a Leader.[114][115] He will also star in Olivier Assayas's action-thriller Idol’s Eye alongside Robert De Niro.[116]
Pattinson plays the guitar and piano, and composes his own music.[117] He also appears as the singer of two songs on the Twilight soundtrack: "Never Think", which he co-wrote with Sam Bradley,[118] and "Let Me Sign", which was written by Marcus Foster and Bobby Long.[119] The songs were included in the film after director Catherine Hardwicke added Pattinson's recordings into an early cut without his knowledge, and he agreed that "one of them specifically, it really made the scene better. It was like it was supposed to be there."[5] The soundtrack for the film How to Be features three original songs performed by Pattinson[120] and written by composer Joe Hastings.[121]
Aside from recording for the soundtracks, Pattinson has said, "I've never really recorded anything – I just played in pubs and stuff", and when asked about a professional music career, he said, "Music is my back-up plan if acting fails."[5] In 2010, Pattinson was awarded the "Hollywood's Most Influential Top Unexpected Musicians" award.

      Up until I was 12 my sisters used to dress me up as a girl and introduce me as 'Claudia'! Twelve was a turning point as I moved to a mixed school and then I became cool and discovered hair gel.
      It's strange, somebody asked for my autograph the other day. Because I finished school and I'm not really doing anything at the moment, I was just kind of aimlessly wandering around London and these two guys who were about 30 came up and asked for my autograph. I was really quite proud at the time, and they wanted to take photos and stuff. And then they were sort of wandering around and I was kind of wandering around and I bumped into them about three times, and every single time their respect for me kept growing and growing and growing.
      They [Barnes Theatre Club] were a very good group, and for some reason when I finished the backstage thing, I just decided to that I should try to act. So I auditioned for Guys and Dolls and got a little tiny part as some Cuban dancer or something and then in the next play I got the lead part, and then I got my agent. So I owe everything to that little club.
      I aspire to be Jack Nicholson. I love his every single mannerism. I used to try and be him in virtually everything I did, I don't know why. I watched One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) when I was about 13, and I dressed like him. I tried to do his accent. I did everything like him. I think it kind of stuck with me.
      The day before [the Harry Potter London premiere] I was just sitting in Leicester Square, happily being ignored by everyone. Then suddenly strangers are screaming your name. Amazing.
      I went to one of these signing conventions. [in '06] It was one of the most interesting experiences I've had. It was so strange that people would pay for autographs. You keep thinking you should do a little dance for them as well or something.
      I have been playing the piano for my entire life - since I was three or four. And the guitar - I used to play classical guitar from when I was about five to 12 years of age. Then I didn't play guitar for like years. About four or five years ago, I got out the guitar again and just started playing blues and stuff. I am not very good at the guitar, but I am all right. I am in a band in London as well.
      My favorite teacher was probably my English teacher because she got me into writing instead of just answering the question. I used to hand in homework with 20 pages of nonsense and she'd still mark it. She was a really amazing teacher.
      I didn't want to get stuck in pretty, public school roles, or I knew I'd end up as some sort of caricature. Playing Dali has been a complete turning point for me. It's the first part I've had that has required really serious thought. I became completely obsessed with Dali during the filming, and I read every biography I could get a hold of. He was the most bizarre, complex man, but in the end I felt I could relate to him. He was basically incredibly shy.
      I wasn't at all focused on school, and I didn't achieve much. But I've got a sense of urgency now. I feel I can't let any more time waste away.
Twilight (2008) is a metaphor for the virtues of chastity, but it's had the opposite effect. I get letters that say "I'm going to kill myself if you don't watch High School Musical 2 (2007) with me". It's a little nuts.
      Everything has become more intense for six months, since 'Twilight' was released. It's hard to handle what's happening to me. I don't have the necessary hindsight, even if only to find a way out to this situation. But this celebrity thing, you can't fight it, it's useless, you can't avoid it. When it's not something you desired during your whole life, or something you don't aspire to, you're free not to care about it. I didn't sign for Disney. There's not a stipulation which forces me to smile to the paparazzi.
      Sometimes I think, 'to hell with acting,' and then I realize I could be working at a shoe shop. Acting is much cooler.
      Please don't give me all my luck now. Make it all stretch. I don't mind waiting. Make it stretch for 70 years.
      When I was 14, I fronted a rap trio. Pretty hard-core for three private school kids from suburban London. And my mum's, like, cramping our style, popping her head in to ask, 'You boys want a sandwich?'
      My old agent used to promote me as the male Keira Knightley. (Laughs) I thought: 'Well, what does that say about me exactly?' Do I pout a lot or something?
      I went to one of these signing conventions in '06. It was one of the most interesting experiences I've had. It was so strange that people would pay for autographs. You keep thinking you should do a little dance for them as well or something.
      None of those associations came out and gave a statement [criticizing Kristen] without being called upon by the media first - who were doing it specifically to get hits on their websites. That whole system of Internet journalists, where no one is called to account, is almost entirely about hate. All these people get away with doing it because they have no responsibility to anyone. All they need is to get a salacious headline and people click on it, because it's easy. And it's quite good being part of these Twilight films because you have to give so many interviews all the time, you can defend yourself. That's the only way. All of us stick together, as well. There are so many little nerds behind their computers, on their little blogs.
      Y'know, there are so few auteurs left. The one thing that pisses me off about working in films is when you start a project and then, suddenly, two days before you start, there's a massive rewrite to make an R-rated movie into something that's PG-13, and it's a totally different story. As soon as that line's been crossed, you know you're not making a movie anymore. You're making a...a... fridge magnet. But with people like Cronenberg you know that, no matter what, there will be a movie at the end, and it will be solid and self-contained, and it's not made for any other reason than it being a movie.
      I was a bit of a loner at school. My first kiss was when I was 12, but I didn't have a girlfriend until I was 18.
      My dad and I were in a restaurant one day and noticed this group of pretty girls. The girls said they'd been to the local acting school. I never did any acting at school - I was quite shy - but after that day my dad nagged me about attending. He said he'd pay me, which is pretty strange, but I went.
      [on performing in 'Cosmopolis'] Before I did this movie I was fully intending on hiding for a couple of years, but this has really reinvigorated my ideas about acting. And I like being slightly on the fringe as well,rather than trying to get movies that are sort of vehicles.
      The world would be a much better place, I think, if all these bankers and billionaires were followed by paparazzi.
      I like movies more than acting, and I like the idea of being in movies that I like so at least you're sort of contributing something.
      I think as soon as you feel validated, you're a bad actor. You need to constantly feel like there's a 99% chance of failure; total failure; devastating failure. You should feel like every single job is a potential which you're never going to get one again.
      [on Edward Cullen from the Twilight (2008) saga] You can tell he's just gonna freak out one day and shoot someone... He's one of those guys who would be like an ax murderer.
      [on his nickname "R-Pattz"] I would like to break the hands and mouth of the person who came up with it.
      I'm just trying to not be in stupid gossip magazines, basically, and I think the best way to do it is never be photographed ever. As I get older, I just get more and more and more self-conscious about getting photographed. I don't know why. I've done it too many times and now I feel like everyone can see through me.
      [on his role in The Rover (2014)] I'm so bad at auditioning and I was terrified that I wasn't going to get it. I really, really fought for it.

early 2000sStage PresencePattinson attends Harrodian School, a noted institution for drama, and joins the Barnes Theater Club after befriending a group of female drama students while out to dinner with his father. In 2003, Pattinson meets with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire director Mike Newell before flying to South Africa to film the TV movie Ring of the Nibelungs. Upon arriving home, he lands the role of Hogwarts hunk Cedric Diggory.2005November 18How Harry Met CedricPattinson skyrockets to international fame as ill-fated Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. "The day before I was just sitting in Leicester Square, happily being ignored by everyone," he says at the film's London premiere. "Then suddenly strangers are screaming your name. Amazing!" Director Newell says, "Pattinson was born to play the role; he's quintessentially English with chiseled public-schoolboy good looks."2008July 18Bloody GorgeousFrom handsome wizard to dashing vampire, Pattinson covers EW as Edward Cullen, the immortal hero of Twilight, with costar Kristen Stewart. Portraying the brooding vampire, described as "devastatingly inhumanly beautiful" in author Stephenie Meyer's Twilight book series, came with daunting expectations for Pattinson. "I stopped reading [blogs] after I saw the signatures saying 'Please, anyone else,'" the actor says of "Twilighters" initially protesting his casting. November 14The Face of TwilightAs the film's highly-anticipated release draws nearer, EW publishes a second Twilight issue with three collectible covers in response to the first cover's polarizing feedback. The ever-increasing buzz surrounding Twilight thrusts little-known Pattinson further into the spotlight. "I asked the producer, 'Is Rob ready for this? Have you guys prepped him? Is he ready to be the It Guy?'" Twilight author Meyer tells the magazine. "I don't think he really is. I don't think he sees himself that way. And I think the transition is going to be a little rocky." November 21Twilight Takes Bite Out of Box Office"Twilighters" come out in droves for the film's release, making it the weekend's No. 1 film with $69.6 million. The movie's monumental success leads Summit Entertainment to green light the onscreen adaptation of Meyer's second Twilight novel, New Moon, with Pattinson and Kristen Stewart returning to star. "Props to Stewart and Pattinson for playing this uncool-girl-meets-undead-boy story with genuine romantic ardor," raves Rolling Stone. "You buy the fantasy because Pattinson goes beyond dreamboat duty to create a character you believe in."2009April 12Interview with the VampireA swoon-worthy Pattinson covers GQ’s April issue, but the magazine reveals Hollywood's reigning heartthrob didn't always render people so smitten. "There was a call from the head of the studio," Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke says about execs questioning Pattinson's casting as Edward Cullen. "'Are you sure you can make this guy handsome?'" Fortunately for fans, Hardwicke won out, and says of the star, "He's obviously ridiculously photogenic, but he's also so talented…I see him creating stylized, odd, wild, fantastical characters."November 20New Moon RisesThe highly anticipated sequel, New Moon, opens, pulling in a record $258 million worldwide to become the third-largest debut on record – behind The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 3. "I think very few human beings will ever get to experience the same feelings and love we feel at Twilight events," Pattinson says at the movie's premiere.2010JanuaryNew Year, New LoveAlthough they've been coy about their relationship, Pattinson and Stewart privately step out to welcome 2010 together  on an island off the south coast of England. But Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke spills the beans to Time about their romance: "I think it took a long time for Kristen to realize, 'OK, I've got to give this a go and really try to be with this person.'" March 12'Remember' Rob, Not EdwardIn Remember Me, Pattinson leaves Edward Cullen behind to play a rebel without a cause, opposite Pierce Brosnan and Emilie de Ravin. "It was the most ridiculous experience," he says of shooting the movie as fans looked on. "You're trying to stay in character and you're trying to walk down the street, but all those people keep reminding you that you're not this character."June 30Eclipsing the CompetitionThe third Twilight film, Eclipse, rakes in more than $150 million during its first week at the box office, making way for two more sequels based on the final book, Breaking Dawn. "I can barely remember the last two years," Pattinson tells Details. "Not like a haze of partying or anything like that. Just it's been crazy."

Born in London, England, Robert Pattinson was bitten by the acting bug when, at age 15, he became involved with the Barnes Theatre Company. After taking on several acting roles onstage, Pattinson made his mainstream debut in the made-for-television movie Ring of the Nibelungs (2004), where he caught the attention of director Mira Nair. 
Nair offered the still unknown British actor a bit part in her 2004 Vanity Fair adaptation, but Pattinson's scenes were later deleted and only appear on the DVD version. Pattinson's bad luck continued when he was fired from the 2005 UK Royal Court Theatre premiere of The Woman Before, shortly before opening night. 
But Pattinson rebounded stronglyand got redemptionlater that year when he landed a supporting role as Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Pattinson, still virtually unknown in Hollywood, was the first person to audition for the sought-after role and was offered the part only a week later. His portrayal of the Hogwarts heartthrob made Pattinson a world-wide star and catapulted him to celebrity status.
Following his stint as Cedric Diggory, Pattinson was named 2005's "British Star of Tomorrow" by Times Online and has been dubbed "the next Jude Law" by Teen People. 
Pattinson's newfound success in Hollywood landed him the coveted role of Edward in the highly-anticipated screen adaptation of Stephenie Meyers' bestselling vampire romance book series, Twilight. Since then, he's gone on to be an international superstar, reprising his role in The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009) and The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010). In fact, he works nonstopin between Twilight movies, he's also played starring roles in Remember Me (2010) with Emilie de Ravin, Water for Elephants (2011) opposite Reese Witherspoon, Bel Ami (2012) with Christina Ricci and David Cronenberg's Cosmopolis (2012) alongside Sarah Gadon and Jay Baruchel. 
He dated his Twilight co-star, Kristen Stewart for four years until July 2012, when it was discovered that she'd cheated on him with her Snow White & the Huntsman director, Rupert Sanders. The couple eventually ended up reuniting after Kristen released a public apology—just in time for the release of the final installment in the series, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 (2012).

Well, who'd have thought that in 2009 Robert would be one of the hottest properties in the movie world? After his appearance in Twilight, everyone seems to want a piece of him, including us.
Born in London, Robert started acting in amateur productions before being spotted to become a model when he was a mere 12 years old. Apparently he got a lot of jobs because he was tall (good), thin (good) and looked like a girl (only good if you're a male model). But then he developed into more of a MAN and that was that. No more modelling.
Instead, Robert got the role of Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and his fate as a new square-jawed screen god was sealed.
The biggest role that Robert has so far taken on is that of Edward in the fantasy film, Twilight. It's catapulted him to icon status amongst teenage girls across the globe and filming for the follow-up, New Moon, has already started.
When you're starring in some of the most popular movies of your time, the rumour-mill is bound to start up. And as we write there are tales all over the internet that Robert is dating his co-star, Kristen Stewart, and that's she's pregnant WITH HIS BABY! Of course, we take all of this with a pile of salt, but it sure cements the fact that Robert is going to be a star of epic proportions - and we love him all the more for it.
