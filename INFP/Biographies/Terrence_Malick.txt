Terrence Frederick Malick (born November 30, 1943)[1] is an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. In a career spanning over four decades he has directed six feature films. He made his directorial debut with the drama Badlands in 1973. Malick released his second film, Days of Heaven, in 1978, after which he took a long hiatus from directing films. His third film, the World War II drama The Thin Red Line, was released in 1998.
Malick has received consistent praise for his work and has been regarded as one of the greatest living filmmakers.[2] He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for The Thin Red Line and The Tree of Life, and the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for The Thin Red Line, as well as winning the Golden Bear at the 49th Berlin International Film Festival for The Thin Red Line, the Palme d'Or at the 64th Cannes Film Festival for The Tree of Life, and the SIGNIS Award at the 69th Venice International Film Festival for To the Wonder.
Terrence Malick was born in Ottawa, Illinois,[3][4][5] or Waco, Texas.[1][6] He is the son of Irene (née Thompson; 1912-2011)[7] and Emil A. Malick (1917-2013),[8] a geologist.[9] His paternal grandparents were Assyrian Christian immigrants.[10][11] Waco is one of the settings of his film The Tree of Life.[12] Malick attended St. Stephen's Episcopal School in Austin, Texas, while his family lived in Bartlesville, Oklahoma.[3] Malick had two younger brothers: Chris and Larry. Larry Malick was a guitarist who went to study in Spain with Andrés Segovia in the late 1960s. In 1968, Larry intentionally broke his own hands due to pressure over his musical studies. Emil went to Spain to help Larry, but Larry died shortly after, apparently committing suicide.[13]
Malick studied philosophy under Stanley Cavell at Harvard University, graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1965. He went on to Magdalen College, Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar. After a disagreement with his tutor, Gilbert Ryle, over his thesis on the concept of world in Kierkegaard, Heidegger, and Wittgenstein, Malick left Oxford without a doctorate.[14] In 1969, Northwestern University Press published Malick's translation of Heidegger's Vom Wesen des Grundes as The Essence of Reasons. Returning to the United States, Malick taught philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology while freelancing as a journalist. He wrote articles for Newsweek, The New Yorker, and Life.[6]
Malick started his film career after earning an MFA from the AFI Conservatory in 1969, directing the short film "Lanton Mills". At the AFI, he established contacts with people such as Jack Nicholson, longtime collaborator Jack Fisk, and agent Mike Medavoy, who procured for Malick freelance work revising scripts. He is credited with the screenplay for Pocket Money (1972), and he wrote an early draft of Dirty Harry (1971).[15]
After one of his screenplays, Deadhead Miles, was made into what Paramount Pictures felt to be an unreleasable film, Malick decided to direct his own scripts. His first work was Badlands (1973), an independent film starring Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek as a young couple on a crime spree in the 1950s. After a troubled production, Badlands drew raves at its premiere at the New York Film Festival, leading to Warner Bros. Pictures buying distribution rights for three times its budget.[16]
Paramount Pictures produced Malick's second film, Days of Heaven (1978), about a love triangle that develops in the farm country of the Texas Panhandle in the early 20th century. The film spent two years in post-production, during which Malick and his crew experimented with unconventional editing and voice-over techniques.[17] Days of Heaven went on to win the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, as well as the prize for Best Director at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival.
Those rambling philosophical voiceovers; the placid images of nature, offering quiet contrast to the evil deeds of men; the stunning cinematography, often achieved with natural light; the striking use of music – here is a filmmaker with a clear sensibility and aesthetic who makes narrative films that are neither literary nor theatrical, in the sense of foregrounding dialogue, event, or character, but are instead principally cinematic, movies that suggest narrative, emotion, and idea through image and sound.
Following the release of Days of Heaven, Malick began developing a project for Paramount, titled Q, that explored the origins of life on earth. During pre-production, he suddenly moved to Paris and disappeared from public view.[19] During this time, he wrote a number of screenplays, including The English Speaker, about Josef Breuer's analysis of Anna O.; adaptations of Walker Percy's The Moviegoer and Larry McMurtry's The Desert Rose;[19] a script about Jerry Lee Lewis; and a stage adaptation of Sansho the Bailiff that was to be directed by Andrzej Wajda, in addition to continuing work on the Q script.[20] Malick's work on Q eventually became the basis for his 2011 film The Tree of Life.[21]
Twenty years after Days of Heaven, Malick returned to film directing in 1998 with The Thin Red Line, a loose adaptation of the James Jones World War II novel of the same name, for which he gathered a large ensemble of famous stars. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, won the Golden Bear at the 49th Berlin International Film Festival,[22] and received critical acclaim.[23]
After learning of Malick's work on an article about Che Guevara during the 1960s, Steven Soderbergh offered Malick the chance to write and direct a film about Guevara that he had been developing with Benicio del Toro. Malick accepted and produced a screenplay focused on Guevara's failed revolution in Bolivia.[24] After a year and a half, the financing had not come together entirely, and Malick was given the opportunity to direct The New World,[25] a script he had begun developing in the 1970s.[26] Consequently, he left the Guevara project in March 2004.[25] Soderbergh went on to direct Che.
The New World, which featured a romantic interpretation of the story of John Smith and Pocahontas, was released in 2005. Over one million feet of film was shot for the film, and three different cuts of varying length were released. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, but received generally mixed reviews during its theatrical run,[27] though it has since been hailed as one of the best films of the decade.[28][29][30]
Malick's fifth feature, The Tree of Life, was filmed in Smithville, Texas, and elsewhere during 2008. Starring Brad Pitt, Jessica Chastain, and Sean Penn, it is a family drama spanning multiple time periods and focuses on an individual's reconciling love, mercy and beauty with the existence of sickness, suffering and death. It premiered at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival[31] where it won the Palme d'Or. It also won the FIPRESCI Award for the Best Film of the Year. At the 84th Academy Awards, it was nominated for three awards including the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Director for Malick, and Best Cinematography for Emmanuel Lubezki. A limited theatrical release in the United States began on May 27, 2011.
More than any other active filmmaker Mr. Malick belongs in the visionary company of homegrown romantics like Herman Melville, Walt Whitman, Hart Crane and James Agee. The definitive writings of these authors did not sit comfortably or find universal favor in their own time. They can still seem ungainly, unfinished, lacking polish and perfection. This is precisely what makes them alive and exciting: "Moby-Dick," "Leaves of Grass," "The Bridge" and "A Death in the Family" lean perpetually into the future, pushing their readers forward toward a new horizon of understanding.
Malick's sixth feature, titled To the Wonder,[33] was shot predominately in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, and a few scenes were filmed in Pawhuska, Oklahoma. The film premiered at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. It is described in the program notes as "an exploration of love in its many forms".[34] The film stars Ben Affleck, Rachel McAdams, Olga Kurylenko, and Javier Bardem.[35]
On November 1, 2011, Filmnation Entertainment announced international sales for Malick's next two projects: Lawless and Knight of Cups. Lawless will star Ryan Gosling, with a supporting cast including Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara and Haley Bennett. Knight of Cups will star Bale, and will also feature Blanchett, along with Isabel Lucas. The films will be shot back-to-back in 2012.[36] Production designer Jack Fisk has indicated a June start date.[37]
During the weekend of September 16, 2011, Malick was photographed and caught on film while on set for one of the first times ever, while he and a small crew were following Christian Bale and Haley Bennett around the Austin City Limits Music Festival as part of preliminary shooting for Lawless.[38][39] He was also seen directing Ryan Gosling and Rooney Mara at the Fun Fun Fun Fest on the weekend on November 4, 2011.[39][40] In early 2012, the title "Lawless" was given to The Weinstein Company's The Wettest County, leaving Malick's Lawless untitled.[38] He was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in June 2012 along with 175 other individuals.[41]
Malick is famously protective of his private life.[42] His contracts stipulate that his likeness may not be used for promotional purposes, and he routinely declines requests for interviews.[19][43]
From 1970 to 1976, Malick was married to Jill Jakes.[44] His companion afterward in the late 1970s was director and screenwriter Michie Gleason.[44] In 1985 he married a Frenchwoman,[44] Michele Morette,[45] whom he met in Paris in 1980; in 1996, Malick asked for a divorce, which was granted.[44][45] Afterward he married Alexandra "Ecky" Wallace, the best friend of his high-school sweetheart.[46]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Terrence Malick was born in Ottawa, Illinois. His family subsequently lived in Oklahoma and he went to school in Austin, Texas. He did his undergraduate work at Harvard, graduating summa cum laude with a degree in philosophy in 1965.A member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society, he attended Magdalen College, Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship, but did not finish his thesis on Martin Heidegger, allegedly because of a disagreement with his advisor. Returning to the States, he taught philosophy at M.I.T. and published a translation of Heidegger's "Vom Wesen des Grundes" as "The Essence of Reasons".Malick did not get his PhD in philosophy: Instead, he attended the American Film Institute Conservatory in its inaugural year (1969), taking a Masters of Fine Arts degree in film-making. His masters thesis was the seventeen-minute comedy short Lanton Mills (1969), which starred Warren Oates and Harry Dean Stanton. Malick himself acted in the short.At A.F.I., Malick made a lasting association with Jack Fisk, who would establish himself as an Oscar-nominated art director and production designer and serve as art director on all of Malick's films. He also picked up Mike Medavoy as an agent, who got Malick work doctoring scripts and marketed his original ones. He wrote the screenplay for the 1972 Alan Arkin trucker movie Deadhead Miles (1973), which was many miles from Harvard let along Oxford, and for the 1972 Paul Newman-Lee Marvin contemporary oater Pocket Money (1972), another departure from fields of academia. "Deadhead Miles" was dumped by Paramount as unreleasable and "Pocket Money", despite being headlined by two Top Ten Box Office stars, flopped.It was an inauspicious start to a legendary career, but it influenced Malick to begin directing his own scripts.His first two films were the now critically acclaimed Badlands (1973) (1973) and Days of Heaven (1978) (1978). He then took a self-imposed retirement of nearly two decades from film-making before lensing his 1998 adaptation of James Jones's The Thin Red Line (1998), which was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including nods for Malick for directing and adapted screenplay.Adopting a Kubrickian pace of movie-making, he directed The New World (2005) (2005) and the autobiographical The Tree of Life (2011) (2011) with gaps of only seven and six years, respectively, between release. However, he reportedly was working on ideas for "The Tree of Life" since the late seventies, including exposing footage that found its way into his finished film.In an unprecedented burst of productivity, he shot his next four films, To the Wonder (2012), _Knight of Cups (2014), an as-yet unnamed drama and the cosmic documentary Voyage of Time (2016) back-to-back during and immediately after completing the long editing process of "Tree of Life". Like Stanley Kubrick, Malick usually takes well over a year to edit his films. All three are highly anticipated by cineastes the world over.
        Known as a bit of a recluse from public life and rarely gives interviews or makes appearances
        Famous for finding the structure and form of his films in the editing process, often reducing the roles of initially larger characters and vice versa
        Known for shooting record amounts of film while trying to capture scenes, emotions and unforeseen moments spontaneously
      In his contract for directing The Thin Red Line (1998), he stated that no current pictures of him could be published or shown anywhere.
      After Days of Heaven (1978), it was a full 20 years before he directed his next film, The Thin Red Line (1998).
      Appeared as unannounced guest on the screening of Badlands (1973) in the retrospective section of the 54th. Berlin film festival in 2004.
      Biography in: John Wakeman, editor. "World Film Directors, Volume Two, 1945-1985". Pages 636-639. New York: The H.W. Wilson Company, 1988.
      He grew up on a farm and worked as a farmhand before studying philosophy at Harvard. After graduating he went to Magdalen College, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar but left before finishing his thesis (on Martin Heidegger) after a disagreement with his advisor. He moved back to the United States and taught philosophy at M.I.T. while freelancing as a journalist.
      Notoriously withdrawn from public life, his friends, such as Martin Sheen, have always remarked that he is a very warm and humble man who prefers to work without medial intrusion.
      One of the most praised aspects of his films are the quality of its cinematography. As of 2014, four of his films have been Oscar nominated in the Best Cinematography category: Days of Heaven (1978), The Thin Red Line (1998), The New World (2005) and The Tree of Life (2011). Only Days of Heaven (1978) managed to win in the category and still is the only Oscar ever given to a Malick film.
      Has worked with three different actors who played the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman: Christian Bale, Ben Affleck and Val Kilmer.
      [on Badlands (1973)] I tried to keep the 1950s to a bare minimum. Nostalgia is a powerful feeling; it can drown out anything. I wanted the picture to set up like a fairy tale, outside time, like Treasure Island. I hoped this would, among other things, take a little of the sharpness out of the violence, but still keep its dreamy quality.
      [on working with Martin Sheen on Badlands (1973)] Martin Sheen was extraordinary. He's a very gifted man. He's from a working class family, so he had all the moods down for the film. And when he wasn't before the cameras, he was helping in the background, wrapping cables, packing up light reflectors. One day I found him going around a gas station and picking up aluminum snapback lids from soda cans. He knew they didn't exist in 1959.
      [on The New World (2005)] I knew it would have a slow, rolling pace. Just get into it; let it roll over you. It's more of an experience film. I leave you to fend for yourself, figure things out yourself.
      [on his future] There's a good many pictures I'd like to make, we'll see how many I'll be allowed to make.
      [on his methodology] I film quite a bit of footage, then edit. Changes before your eyes, things you can do and things you can't. My attitude is always let it keep rolling.
=======================================================
From All Movie Guide: Terrence Malick is one of the great enigmas of contemporary filmmaking, a shadowy figure whose towering reputation rests largely on a very small body of work. A visual stylist beyond compare, Malick emerged during the golden era of 1970s American movie-making, bringing to the screen a dreamlike, ethereal beauty countered by elliptical, ironic storytelling; resonant and mythic, his films illuminated themes of love and death with rare mastery, their indelible images distinguished by economy and precision.Born in Waco, TX, on November 30, 1943, Malick spent many of his formative summers working as a farmhand, an experience upon which he would draw extensively in his films. Upon graduating from Harvard with a degree in philosophy, he entered Magdalen College in Oxford as a Rhodes scholar, but exited prior to completing his final thesis. On returning to the U.S., he became a freelance journalist, with his byline appearing in such publications as Life, Newsweek, and The New Yorker. While tenuring as a philosophy professor at M.I.T., Malick enrolled in a colleague's film course. In 1969, he was accepted into the first graduating class at the American Film Institute's Center for Advanced Studies, financing his studies by rewriting the screenplays for such films as Deadhead Miles (which did not see release until 1982), Dirty Harry, and Drive, He Said. 
Upon completing his AFI studies with 1972's 12-minute short Lanton Mills, Malick earned his first feature screenwriting credit on Stuart Rosenberg's Pocket Money. That same year, he also began production on his directorial debut, Badlands. Rejecting all studio offers, Malick gathered financing through a partnership agreement with a group of several small investors, shooting with a non-union crew on a budget of less than 350,000 dollars. The finished 1973 product, an iconic and loose retelling of the Starkweather/Fugate murder spree of the 1950s, bore little trace of its low-budget genesis, however, and was widely hailed as a masterpiece upon its release. However, a follow-up was not quickly forthcoming, and apart from the script for Jack Starrett's 1974 crime caper The Gravy Train, penned under the pseudonym David Whitney, Malick fell silent for five years.
When he finally resurfaced with 1978's Days of Heaven, the critical praise was even more thunderous. Shot with impeccable beauty by cinematographer Nestor Almendros (who won an Academy Award for his work), the tale of wheat harvesters in the Texas Panhandle at the turn of the century was an elegy for America's past, a heartland corrupted by greed and progress. After the picture's release, Malick -- who won a Cannes Best Director award for the film -- relocated to Paris, where he lived in virtual seclusion without publicly commenting on his past movie work or on the possibility of future projects. Finally, after nearly two decades of silence, in 1997, Malick announced his return to filmmaking with an adaptation of the James Jones novel {-The Thin Red Line}. The highly anticipated 1998 film, while not the long-awaited masterpiece many were expecting, met with positive reviews and earned Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar nominations for Malick. Filled with the kind of stunning imagery that defined Days of Heaven, the film effectively convinced many observers that although Malick may have been lost to Hollywood for years, he had in no way lost his touch. Seven years later, another Malick film, the historical drama The New World, followed, also to positive reviews. Six years later, Malick returned with The Tree of Life, a philosophical essay about God, life, fate, and family that garnered a thunderous critical buzz after winning the coveted Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival, but opened to indifferent business. Still, the film's passionate defenders were vindicated when the Academy awarded the film Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Cinematography, and Best Director. ~ Jason Ankeny, Rovi

(Terrence Malick’s new film, The Tree of Life, is now out in select theaters. See early reviews of the Palme d’Or winning film or read my review of the film for Christianity Today).
There is so little magic left in cinema, and so few figures characters who loom large enough to inspire the kind of bigger-than-life mythos formerly reserved for the likes of Orson Welles, Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin, Kubrick. Terrence Malick is one of them. He’s a rare breed—a iconoclastic, shadowy figure who guards his privacy so fiercely (and in the process, bolsters his mythical stature) that he doesn’t even appear at the Cannes world premiere of a film he’s spent 30 years planning. (Although—wait—he was there, hiding in the back like an entertained angel unaware).
Whether or not Malick takes pride in his J.D. Salinger, Thomas Pynchon-esque reputation (doesn’t do interviews, doesn’t let any camera near his face), as opposed to him just being “very shy” (the official explanation), is beside the point. It’s part of his process, integral to his art. He wants his films to be experienced on their own terms—phenomenological confrontations with truth and beauty, unencumbered by silly things like “director’s commentary” or other such explanatory tools for “understanding.” Malick’s films aren’t to be understood. They’re to be experienced, embraced, surrendered to.
As such, Malick’s biography is hardly germane. Or is it? As an auteurist to the core (i.e. a follower of directors and their recurring cinematic preoccupations), I have to believe that Malick the man informs Malick “the oeuvre.” Certainly Malick’s biography plays a big role in The Tree of Life. And so, for the sake of understanding perhaps a little more of what makes Malick tick, here are 39 random facts (some substantiated, some only of plucked from a single, negligible Internet source) about the venerable artist:
He grew up in Texas and Oklahoma, the son of Emil (an oil geologist originally from Lebanon) and Irene (who grew up on a farm in Illinois).
His brother Chris (the middle son) was badly burned in a car crash that killed his wife. Youngest brother Larry went to Spain to study guitar, but committed suicide in 1968.
Malick went to high school at St. Stephen’s Episcopal in Westlake, Texas, where he played on the football team.
He went to Harvard as an undergraduate, starting in 1961 as a philosophy major, studying under respected film theorist Stanley Cavell, who provoked Malick’s interest in German philosopher Martin Heidegger.
Following his junior year at Harvard, he traveled to Germany, met Martin Heidegger and translated The Essence of Reasons.
In 1969, Malick published The Essence of Reasons as part of the prestigious Northwestern University Press series, Studies in Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy. This “marked a substantial contribution to American Heidegger scholarship,” notes Martin Woessner in Heidegger in America.
Following Harvard, Malick went to England as a Rhodes Scholar, studying philosophy at Magdalen College, Oxford.
He had a disagreement with his advisor, Gilbert Ryle, over his thesis on the concept of the world in Kierkegaard, Heidegger, and Wittgenstein, and ultimately left Oxford without taking a doctorate.
In 1968, he was appointed to be a lecturer in philosophy for one year at MIT, though he admits he “was not a good teacher.”
In the late 60s, Malick wrote for Life Magazine and The New Yorker, which sent him to Bolivia to do a piece on Che Guevera.
In the fall of 1969 he came to Los Angeles to study film at AFI, where he was in the same class as David Lynch and Paul Schrader.
In 1971, Malick wrote, produced & directed his thesis film, the 18-minute long Lanton Mills (starring himself, Warren Oates & Harry Dean Stanton). 
He wrote an early version of the Great Balls of Fire script as well as script adaptations of Walker Percy’s The Moviegoer and Larry McMurtry’s The Desert Rose.
At the end of his second year at AFI, Malick began work on Badlands, which was influenced by his love of books like The Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, Swiss Family Robinson, Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn—“all involving an innocent in a drama over his or her head.”
Malick appears in a cameo in Badlands, only because the intended actor didn’t show up on the day the scene was shot.
Following his second film, Days of Heaven, Moved to Paris (in the summer of 1978) and began work on a project called Q, which dramatized the origins of life (this eventually became The Tree of Life). Paramount poured $1 million into the development of Q, but it went nowhere.
During this time, Malick traveled the world and indulged his love of nature. He explored the ancient caves of Nepal, climbed in the Alps, embarked on long excursions in Greece, Nova Scotia and the south of France.
During his “sabbatical,” home base was an apartment in Paris and later two apartments (one for living, one for writing) in a prefabricated building in Austin, Texas.
In the early 80s, Malick fell in love with Michèle, a Parisienne who lived in his same building in Paris and had a daughter, Alex. After a few years the three of them moved to Austin, Texas
Malick married Alexandra “Ecky” Wallace in 1998 (his rumored high school sweetheart from his days at St. Stephen’s). They are still married and currently reside in Austin, Texas.
Ecky Wallace is the mother of actor Will Wallace, who appears in The Thin Red Line, The New World and The Tree of Life. 
Ecky’s father was an Episcopalian priest in Houston, and Ecky herself is very devout. She attended seminary at the Seminary of the Southwest and received a master’s degree in 1997.
Terrence and Ecky attend an Episcopal church in Austin, possibly the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd.
Malick loves classical music, Italian cinema, bird watching, astronomy, ornithology, German philosophy, French philosophy, English literature, among other things.
Starting with The New World, Malick has instituted “rules” in his filmmaking, including  using only natural light, no cranes, no big rigs, and handheld cameras only.
Malick was (relatively) active as a producer in the 2000s, producing such films as  David Gordon Green’s Undertow, Michael Apted’s Amazing Grace, and documentaries The Endurance and The Unforeseen. 
He recently finished filming his 6th film in Bartlesville, Oklahoma (where he lived as a boy). The film stars Ben Affleck, Rachel McAdams, Olga Kurylenko, Javier Bardem and Rachel Weisz.

The Beautiful Country is another he produced, a few years back, about a young Vietnamese man who goes to America to find his dad, a soldier during the Vietnam War. I really enjoyed it.
A person is always more than we suspect: We “can know a person and not really know him at the same time.” (Badlands)
I want to recommend you a site by Ashley (assumedly fictitious name), a writer that in the end of 2006 published some curious literature: conversations between father and son, poems about trees and forbidden fruits, dinosaurs, the love for the ocean, a woman that suffers alone in silence beside her husband, about life, death, and everything else, as the author says. I choose to quote When I was Young:
For those less attentive spectators of The Tree of Life, there are two porcelain angels in the dead son’s room, by the window. In the architect’s dream, we see something filmed against the sky that could be called the disappeared house, but I believe it would also be properly named the castle made of clouds. It even has something in the front that remembers a drawbridge. And one more thing: Holly and Kit go on the plane as prisioners. And what is the last shot of “Badlands”? The tops of the clouds.
There is no way in hell that his favorite film is Zoolander!!! I am with Sarah George: ” where did you find all these great facts?” By the way, Mallick is the only director today holding the candle of cinema and maintaining it alive since Tarkovsky died.
The search is what anyone would undertake if he were not sunk in the everydayness of his own life…. To become aware of the possibility of the search is to be onto something. Not to be onto something is to be in despair.

“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not "perish, but have eternal life. For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.” (John 3:16-17)
 “In the relation to God, unconditional exclusiveness and unconditional inclusiveness are one. For those who enter into the absolute relationship, nothing particular retains any importance—neither things nor beings, neither earth nor heaven—but everything is included in the relationship. For entering into the pure relationship does not involve ignoring everything but seeing everything in the You, not renouncing the world but placing it upon its proper ground. Looking away from the world is no help toward God; staring at the world is no help either; but whoever beholds the world in him stands in his presences…” (from I and Thou)
 “When I attempted a few minutes ago, to describe our spiritual longings, I was omitting one of their most curious characteristics. We usually notice it just as the moment of vision dies away, as the music ends, or as the landscape loses the celestial light… For a few minutes we have had the illusion of belonging to that world. Now we wake to find that it is no such thing. We have been mere spectators. Beauty has smiled, but not to welcome us; her face turned in our direction, but not to see us. We have not been accepted, welcomed, or taken into the dance. We may go when we please, we may stay if we can, no one cares. Now, a scientist may reply that since most of the things we call beautiful are inanimate it is not very surprising that they take no notice of us. That, of course, is true. It is not the physical objects that I am speaking of, but that indescribable Something of which they become for a moment the messengers. And part of the bitterness which mixes with the sweetness of that message is due to the fact that it so seldom seems to be a message intended for us, but rather something we have overheard. By bitterness I mean pain, not resentment. We should hardly dare to ask that any notice be taken of ourselves. But we pine. The sense that in the universe we are treated as strangers, the longing to be acknowledged, to meet with some response, the bridge some chasm that yawns between us and reality, is part of our inconsolable secret.” (from The Weight of Glory)
“Truth is the truth of Being. Beauty does not occur alongside and apart from this truth. When truth sets itself into the work, it appears. Appearance—as this being of truth in the work and as work—is beauty. Thus the beautiful belongs to the advent of truth, truth’s taking of its place. It does not exist merely relative to pleasure and purely as its object.” (from “The Origin of the Work of Art.”)
“Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.” (I Corinthians 13:12)
“All media work us over completely. They are so pervasive in their personal, political, economic, aesthetic, psychological, moral, ethical, and social consequences that they leave no part of us untouched, unaffected, unaltered.” (from The Medium is the Massage)
“And as I sat there brooding on the old unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s long dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it, He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.” (from The Great Gatsby)
“All representations, even the most abstract, infer a rendezvous with intelligibility or, at the least, with a strangeness attenuated, qualified by observance and willed form. Apprehension (the meeting with the other) signifies both fear and perception. The continuum between both, the modulation from one to the other, lie at the source of poetry and the arts.” (from Real Presences)
 “What is the nature of a being that is able to produce art? Man is finite. He is, as one could say, mixed of being and nonbeing. Once he was not. Now he is and some time he will not be. He is not by himself, but thrown into existence and he will be thrown out of existence and cease to be for himself. He is delivered to the flux of time which runs from the past to the future through the ever-moving point which is called the present. He is aware of the infinite. He is aware that he belongs to it. But he is also aware that he is excluded from it… Out of the anxiety, and the double awareness that we are finite and that we belong to infinity from which we are excluded, the urge arises to express the essential unity of that which we are in symbols which are religious and artistic.” (from On Art and Architecture)
“Poets have, indeed, often communicated in their own mode of expression truths identical with the theologians’ truths; but just because of the difference in the modes of expression, we often fail to see the identity of the statements.” (from The Mind of the Maker)
“He will grant thee a hiding place within Him, and once hidden in Him he will hide thy sins. For He is the friend of sinners... He does not merely stand still, open His arms and say, 'Come hither'; no, he stands there and waits, as the father of the lost son waited, rather He does not stand and wait, he goes forth to seek, as the shepherd sought the lost sheep, as the woman sought the lost coin. He goes--yet no, he has gone, but infinitely farther than any shepherd or any woman, He went, in sooth, the infinitely long way from being God to becoming man, and that way He went in search of sinners.” (from Training in Christianity)
“In what belongs to the deeper meanings of nature and her mediation between us and God, the appearances of nature are the truths of nature, far deeper than any scientific discoveries in and concerning them. The show of things is that for which God cares most, for their show is the face of far deeper things than they; we see in them, in a distant way, as in a glass darkly, the face of the unseen. It is through their show, not through their analysis, that we enter into their deepest truths. What they say to the childlike soul is the truest thing to be gathered of them.” (from The Voice of Job)
“In uncertainty I am certain that underneath their topmost layers of frailty men want to be good and want to be loved. Indeed, most of their vices are attempted short cuts to love. When a man comes to die, no matter what his talents and influence and genius, if he dies unloved his life must be a failure to him and his dying a cold horror.” (from East of Eden)
“What is the malaise? You ask. The malaise is the pain of loss. The world is lost to you, the world and the people in it, and there remains only you and the world and you no more able to be in the world than Banquo’s ghost.” (from The Moviegoer)
“Church is to be participated in and not consumed. The point is not what one gets out of it, but the worship of God; the service takes place both because of and despite the needs, strengths, and frailties of the people present. How else could it be?” (from Dakota)
“Whenever I think of Edward, I think of playing catch in a hot street and that wonderful weariness of the arms. I think of leaping after a high throw and that wonderful collaboration of the whole body with itself and that wonderful certainty and amazement when you know the glove is just where it should be. Oh, I will miss the world!” (from Gilead) 
“Preaching the gospel means announcing Jesus as Lord of the world; and, unless we are prepared to contradict ourselves with every breath we take, we cannot make that announcement without seeking to bring that lordship to bear over every aspect of the world.” (from What Saint Paul Really Said). 
“Gazing at some detail like a bird or a cloud, we can all ignore its awful blue background; we can neglect the sky; and precisely because it bears down upon us with an annihilating force it is felt as nothing. A thing of this kind can only be an impression and a rather subtle impression; but to me it is a very strong impression made by pagan literature and religion. I repeat that in our special sacramental sense there is, of course, the absence of the presence of God. But there is in a very real sense the presence of the absence of God. We feel it in the unfathomable sadness of pagan poetry; for I doubt if there was ever in all the marvelous manhood of antiquity a man who was happy as St. Francis was happy.” (from The Everlasting Man) 
"I have seen the task which God has given the sons of men with which to occupy themselves. He has made everything appropriate in its time. He has also set eternity in their heart, yet so that man will not find out the work which God has done from the beginning even to the end. I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good in one's lifetime; moreover, that every man who eats and drinks sees good in all his labor--it is the gift of God. I know that everything God does will remain forever; there is nothing to add to it and there is nothing to take from it, for God has so worked that men should fear Him. That which is has been already and that which will be has already been, for God seeks what has passed by." (Ecclesiastes 3:10-15).
“What is that feeling when you’re driving away from people and they recede on the plain till you see their specks dispersing?—it’s the too-huge world vaulting us, and it’s good bye. But we lean forward to the next crazy venture beneath the skies.” (from On the Road)
"Thou hast made us for Thyself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in Thee..."
“Unless I am convinced by proofs from Scriptures or by plain and clear reasons and arguments, I can and will not retract, for it is neither safe nor wise to do anything against conscience. Here I stand. I can do no other. God help me. Amen."

Terrence MalickDirector / ScreenwriterBorn: 30 November 1943Birthplace: Ottawa, IllinoisBest known as: The Oscar-nominated director of The Thin Red LineTerrence Malick is the award-winning writer and director known for feature films that are as thoughtful and ethereal as they are rare. He was Oscar-nominated as best director for both The Thin Red Line (1998) and The Tree of Life (2011). Terrence Malick was born in Illinois but grew up in Texas and Oklahoma; his father, Emil Malick, worked for Phillips Petroleum. Terrence Malick studied philosophy at Harvard and graduated in 1966, then went to Magdalen College, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. He worked briefly as a journalist and then returned to the U.S. to teach philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Eventually he attended the American Film Institute, and in 1971 he raised the money for his first feature: Badlands, a murder-spree drama starring Sissy Spacek and Martin Sheen. After two years of filming and editing, Badlands was released to acclaim in 1973, establishing Malick's reputation for unusual subjects and visual poetry. In 1978 he directed Days of Heaven, a handsome and slow-moving art-house hit. The film went over budget and schedule, due in large part to Malick's detail-obsessed style of directing and editing. (These traits, plus his habit of avoiding reporters, earned Malick comparisons to Stanley Kubrick; the Daily Telegraph once called him "The J.D. Salinger of the movie business.") Seemingly soured by the experience, Malick spent nearly two decades living in France and traveling before directing his next feature, the World War II drama The Thin Red Line. His other major films include The New World (2005), starring Colin Farrell as Captain John Smith, and Tree of Life, a metaphysical family drama starring Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain. Tree of Life won the Palme de Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for a best picture Oscar as well as winning Malick the best director nomination.Extra credit: Terrence Malick "is the son of an oil company executive of Assyrian descent," according to a 2 June 2011 article in the Austin American-Statesman. The article continues: "Despite numerous reports that Malick is a Waco native, he was actually born near Chicago in November 1943… His grandparents Nanajan and Avilmelk Malick emigrated to the United States from Urmia, in what is now part of Iran, in the 1930s"… Terrence Malick has been married three times: to Jill Jakes (from around 1970 until their divorce in 1978), to Michelle Morette (from 1985 until their divorce in about 1996), and to Alexandra Wallace (from about 1997 to present)… According to the book Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, Malick has two younger brothers, Chris and Larry. "Larry went to Spain to study guitar with Segovia, a taskmaster of legendary proportions. In the summer of 1968, Terry learned that his brother had broken both his own hands, apparently distraught over his studies. Terry's father asked him to go over to Spain to help Larry. Terry refused. His father went himself, and returned with Larry's body. He had apparently committed suicide"… Badlands was based on the real-life killing spree by Charlie Starkweather in 1958.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC.

=======================================================
One of the most enigmatic directors and visual stylists in contemporary American cinema, Terrence Malick was born in Ottawa, Illinois. He grew up in rural Oklahoma and Texas, working as a farmhand and on oil fields. Despite these modest upbringings, Malick graduated with a philosophy degree from Harvard and was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University, although he later dropped out of the latter due to disagreements with his professor. Still, the studious Malick returned to the United States and began teaching philosophy at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), while also enrolling in a graduate film course at the American Film Institute. To finance his pursuit into film at the AFI, Malick contributed uncredited rewrites on the films Deadhead Miles (1972) and Dirty Harry (1971). 
Upon completing his studies, Malick began production on his first film, Badlands (1973). Following two teenage criminals (played by Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek) on the run in the Dakotas, the film was a loose re-telling of the Starkweather-Fugate killing spree from the 1950s. Made on a budget of less than $450,000, the film drew rave reviews and turned Malick into a filmmaker to watch.
Five years later, Malick returned with Days Of Heaven (1978). Featuring Richard Gere and Brooke Adams as farm laborers in the Panhandle, the film was hailed for its lush cinematography and symbolic imagery. Days Of Heaven cemented Malick as a unique filmmaker and storyteller who told his narrative and expressed emotions and themes through image and sound, rather than dialogue. Malick received the Best Director prize at the Cannes Film Festival for the drama, which also took home a Best Cinematography Oscar.
Upon completing Days Of Heaven, Malick took a nearly 20-year hiatus from filmmaking and moved to Paris to teach. In 1997, however, the reclusive director announced his return to American cinema with the World War II drama The Thin Red Line (1998). The film, based on the James Joyce novel about a legion of American soldiers during the Battle of Guadalcanal, boasted a large ensemble including Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Adrien Brody and Woody Harrelson. The Thin Red Line won the Golden Lionthe top award at the Berlin Film Festivaland also garnered seven Academy Award nominations, including two for Malick in the directing and adapted screenplay categories.
As The Thin Red Line garnered the most commercial success for the director thus far, Malick seized an opportunity to finance The New World (2005), a script he had been developing since the 1970s. The New World, a dramatization of American colonization over Native Americans in the 17th century, focused mainly on Pocahontas and her relationships with John Smith (Colin Farrell) and John Rolfe (Christian Bale). 
Malick's The Tree of Life (2011) is an audacious and visually breathtaking family drama starring Brad Pitt and Sean Penn which won the Palme D'or, the coveted top prize at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. He also received a 2012 Academy Award nomination for Best Achievement in Directing.
Although responsible for a small body of workfive films in 40 yearsTerrence Malick remains a towering presence in American cinema, and one of its most illuminating visionaries and storytellers.
