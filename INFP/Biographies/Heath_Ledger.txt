 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          When a hunky, twenty-year-old heart-throb Heath Ledger first came to the attention of the public in 1999, it was all too easy to tag him as a "pretty boy" and an actor of little depth. He spent several years trying desperately to sway this image, but this was a double-edged sword. But that comes much later in his story. Heath Ledger was born on the fourth of April 1979, in Perth, Western Australia.As the story goes, in junior high school it was compulsory to take one of two electives, either cooking or drama. As Heath could honestly not see himself in a cooking class he tried his hand at drama. Heath was talented, there was no denying that. However, the rest of the class did not acknowledge his talent, possibly out of jealousy. When he was seventeen he and a friend decided to pack up, leave school, take a car and rough it to Sydney. Heath believed Sydney to be the place where dreams are made or, at least, where actors can possibly get their big break. Upon arriving in Sydney with a purported sixty-nine cents to his name, Heath tried everything to get a break.His first real acting job came in a low-budget movie called Blackrock (1997), a largely unimpressive cliché; an adolescent angst film about one boy's struggle when he learns his best mate raped a girl. He did not have a large part in this movie. In fact, it was a very small one. The only thing of note in his role was that you got to see him get his lights punched out. After that small role Heath auditioned for a role in a T.V. show called Sweat (1996) about a group of young Olympic hopefuls. He got offered one of two roles, one as a swimmer, another as a gay cyclist. Heath accepted the latter because he felt to really stand out as an actor one had to accept unique roles that stood out from the bunch. It got him small notice, but unfortunately the show was quickly axed, which led him to look for other roles. He was in Home and Away (1988) for a very short period, in which he played a surfer who falls in love with one of the girls of Summer Bay. Then came his very brief role in Paws (1997). Paws was a film which existed solely to cash in on guitar prodigy Nathan Cavaleri's brief moment of fame, where he was the hottest thing in Australia. Heath played a student in the film, involved in a stage production of a Shakespeare play, in which he played "Oberon". A very brief role, this did nothing other than give him a small paycheck, but nothing to advance his career. Then came Two Hands (1999). He went to the U.S. trying to audition for film roles, showcasing his brief role in Roar (1997) opposite then unknown Vera Farmiga.He could not find any American roles but then Australian director Gregor Jordan auditioned him for the lead in Two Hands (1999), which he got. An in your face Aussie crime thriller, Two Hands (1999) was outstanding and helped him secure a role in 10 Things I Hate About You (1999). After that, it seemed Heath was being typecast as a young hunk, which he did not like, so he accepted a role in a very serious war drama The Patriot (2000).What followed was a stark inconsistency of roles, Ledger accepting virtually every single character role, anything to avoid being typecast. Some met with praise, like his short role in Monster's Ball (2001), but his version of Ned Kelly (2003) was an absolute flop, which led distributors hesitant to even release it outside Australia. Heath finally had deserved success with his role in Brokeback Mountain (2005), for which he was nominated for an Oscar and a B.A.F.T.A. Ledger was found dead on January 22, 2008 in his apartment in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo, with a bottle of prescription sleeping pills near-by. It was concluded weeks later that he died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs that included pain-killers, sleeping pills and antianxiety medication. After his death he received more than thirty posthumous awards for his portrayal as the psychopathic clown prince of crime in The Dark Knight (2008) (including the Oscar, S.A.G., B.A.F.T.A., and Golden Globe)
      He and his older sister, Kate Ledger, are named after the two main romantic characters of the Emily Brontë novel, "Wuthering Heights".

      Was a great admirer of Johnny Depp's work. Like Depp, Ledger worked hard to avoid being typecast as a teen heartthrob early on, in the hopes of expanding his career options. Both actors enjoyed taking risky, physically unappealing roles that surprised audiences. Depp was one of the three actors who filled in for Ledger's last unfinished role after his death, in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009).
      Won almost every award in which he was nominated for his performance as The Joker in The Dark Knight (2008) including the quintuple crown (a Golden Globe, BAFTA, SAG, Critics' Choice Award, and Oscar).

      Was a big fan of Nick Drake. Directed and starred in a music video for Nick Drake's "Black Eyed Dog".
      As a tribute, Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law helped Terry Gilliam complete The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009) by taking over Ledger's unfinished role. Thus the public was able to watch his last performance. The three actors donated their salaries to his daughter.
      In an interview, he admitted that he disliked his portrayal of the titular character in Casanova (2005), saying he took the wrong approach to the role.
Ang Lee offered him the role of 'Ennis Del Mar' after being impressed with his performance in Monster's Ball (2001).
      Met up with Christopher Nolan to exchange ideas about how he was going to play the Joker before there was even a script for The Dark Knight (2008). He was Christopher Nolan's first and only choice for the Joker.
      Was only 4 years older than Kate Mara who plays his teenage daughter in Brokeback Mountain (2005).

      He was five years younger than Christian Bale, making him the first actor to play The Joker who was younger than the actor playing Batman.
      I only do this because Im having fun. The day I stop having fun, I'll just walk away. I wasn't going to have fun doing a teen movie again.... I don't want to do this for the rest of my life....I don't want to spend the rest of my youth doing this in this industry. There's so much I want to discover. (Vanity Fair, August 2000)
      I prefer to date older women because they don't try to act older like younger girls but because they try to act younger.
      It's a little uncomfortable doing love scenes in armor, but, you know, when the heat's on, the heat's on. (Access Hollywood (1996), August 2000)
      [about the paparazzi] Most of the time you don't even know they're there. Now, that's the scary thing. It's really strange and invading, but I'm still working it all out. I try to not let it bother me. I really try and find the humour in all of it. And if I want to swim naked in my pool, I'm still going to do it. I certainly don't want to feel that I have to change everything in my life that I do to cater to them. I just won't let it happen. (National Post, May 2001)
      I don't have a technique. I've never been a believer in having one set technique on how to act. There are no rules and there is no rulebook. At the end of the day, it all comes down to my instincts. That's the one thing that guides me through every decision professionally. Socially, also. That's my technique. Yeah, you read through the script 100 times. I guess I have little characteristics about myself. Sometimes, most often than not, once we start shooting I won't look at the script at all until we finished shooting. It's kind of like it's been imprinted in my head during rehearsals. You just let it go. (Reel.com, May 2001)
      I'm the worst auditioner, really, really bad. I mean, you're being judged and I'm just so aware of it that it consumes me. I can't relax, I'm tied in knots, so the voice is very taut and tense. You're so aware that you're acting 'cause you're sitting across from this lady with a piece of paper who's going, ''I'm. Going. To. Shoot. You. If. You. Don't. Blah, blah, blah,'' in this emotionless voice. It's foul. I hate it. (EW.com, May 2001)
      People just love to bash LA. People say it's so pretentious, so arrogant, so this and that. But it's truly a wonderful place. You don't have to go to the places where that stuff goes on. You don't have to go to Beverly Hills, you don't have to go to the parties. You can live up in the Lower Canyon and live such a perfectly healthy, beautiful, fun life with all your friends. You can drive two hours one way and be at the Joshua Tree desert, two hours one way you're skiing at Big Bear. Sure, it can get full-on and that's why it's good to get out. But it's too easy just to say, "Nup, I hate it. I'm not living there anymore." (NW Magazine, March 2000)
      [about growing up with his mom and his sisters] I learned respect for women, and patience. You grow up with all those women around you...you learn to wait your turn. (Cosmopolitan, June 1998)
      I never studied acting in Australia. I never had an empty stage and black pajamas to run around and express myself.
      [on his character "Ennis" in Brokeback Mountain (2005)] The challenge was to capture the stillness of him. I have kind of semi-frantic, nervous energy. Harnessing that was something I thought I'd have to work out. Shooting in the wilderness, the stillness became like this innate quality.
      Brooklyn seems to me the closest thing in America to Europe. The neighbors and locals are beautiful people. It's like a village.
      [on daughter Matilda and being a father] Matilda is adorable, and beautifully observant and wise. Michelle and I love her so much. Becoming a father exceeds all my expectations. It's the most remarkable experience I've ever had - it's marvelous.
      I'm not good at future planning. I don't plan at all. I don't know what I'm doing tomorrow. I don't have a day planner and I don't have a diary. I completely live in the now, not in the past, not in the future.
      [on playing "The Joker" in The Dark Knight (2008)] The Joker, so far, is definitely the most fun I've had with any character. He's just out of control -- no empathy, he's a sociopath, uh, a psychotic, mass-murdering clown. And, uh, I'm just thoroughly, thoroughly enjoying it. It's just exceeded any expectations I had of what the experience would be like.
      [on his choice of film projects] I feel like I'm wasting time if I repeat myself. I can't say I'm proud of my work. It's the same with everything I do: the day I say 'It's good' is the day I should start doing something else.
      [on walking down the red carpet] Like diving into an Olympic pool, swimming the length underwater, then emerging gasping for breath. It's so noisy that it's quiet, you can't hear; the flashlights are so blinding that it's dark, you can't see.
      I start to get bored, not with the choices I was making, because I didn't really have a choice. The choices were being made for me -- I was being thrown into projects. So I kind of put the brakes on that. In a sense, I destroyed my career to rebuild it again.
      I like to do something I fear. I like to set up obstacles and defeat them. I like to be afraid of the project. I always am. When I get cast in something, I always believe I shouldn't have been cast. I fooled them again. I can't do it. I don't know how to do it. There's a huge amount of anxiety that drowns out any excitement I have toward the project.
      No amount of money changes what I do between 'action' and 'cut'. Before I got into the industry, I never imagined I'd have anywhere near the money I have now. I don't need any more. It's not that I don't want the money, it's just that I would have been really happy sitting on a beach or surfing every morning. I never had money, and I was very happy without it. When I die, my money's not gonna come with me. My movies will live on - for people to judge what I was as a person. I just want to stay curious.
      [on dropping the character once the shoot ends] I kind of save the living for the time between action and cut. I'm pretty good at dropping a character once it's over for the day. Certainly once the film is over, I throw it all away. Your life is what matters. (Chicago Sun Times, November 2007)
      [on the directors he would have liked to work with] Look, most of them are dead. Fellini. Cassavettes. Bob Fosse. Stanley Kubrick. I would have loved to work with them. I would love to work with many people who are around, but they're not lining up just yet. Terrence Malick is one person who comes to mind. I would love to be in one of his visual poems. (Chicago Sun Times, November 2007)
      [on his sleeping problems] Last week I probably slept an average of two hours a night. I couldn't stop thinking. My body was exhausted, and my mind was still going. (The New York Times, November 2007)
      Some people find their shtick. I've never figured out who Heath Ledger is on film: 'This is what you expect when you hire me, and it will be recognizable.' People always feel compelled to sum you up, to presume that they have you and can describe you. That's fine. But there are many stories inside of me and a lot I want to achieve outside of one flat note. (The New York Times, November 2007)
      I think [getting the role] was tougher for other people to comprehend than it was for me. I'm looking forward to it. A part of me feels like I've been warming up to [playing the Joker] for years. In The Brothers Grimm (2005), [director] Terry Gilliam helped me put on a sort of clown act and adjust to that sort of pace. And I feel it's something within me I know how to do. I like putting on a mask. It'll be dark and sinister and exciting. Not being a huge comic book fan, and not one to really follow comic book movies, I'm relaxed about it. (NY Daily News, November 2006)
      I'm shy. People get confused. They think as an actor you can get up and be confident on the screen. "Why aren't you like this in normal life? Why can't you act in your social life?" Because I can't! (NY Post, 2001)
      A lot of people think ambition or success and they think dollars. My ambition is all in my head. I'm on a f---ing journey. I'm on a walkabout. It's about collecting wisdom of emotions and heart and self and understanding. Being absolutely comfortable with your body and life and the earth, sun, and moon being the only truths. That's what my success is, getting underneath that. (Entertainment Weekly, 2001)
      [on choosing his roles] I don't have that much forward planning about what I want to do in the future. But I guess once I find something, like if I'm doing Lords of Dogtown (2005), I really like to flip the scale on the next job I'm doing. It's almost like you are a switchboard in a sound booth and on one job you use one side and by the end of the job you are kind of exhausted by it, but you didn't use any of the other side over here so you have to find something that will mean you using this half of your brain, energy wise, and that's how Brokeback Mountain (2005) and Casanova complemented each other. Brokeback was excruciating and Casanova (2005) was drinking wine and eating pasta, it was like a holiday. But I've got no future plans, I don't know what I'm going to do next as along as it scares me, as long as it's something new, as long as I get to scare other people. As long as it's an opportunity to evolve and grow as an actor and a person and challenge myself.
      Honesty always gets my attention. Not particularly someone who is honest to me, but someone who is honest with themselves. That is a quality I really enjoy, admire and love.
      I love acting. Oh, God, I love it. But all this fame and all this bullshit attention. I'm not supernatural. I've done nothing extremely special to deserve the position. It happens every couple of years, and it's happened to hundreds of people before me. (Newsweek, July 2000)
      I have never had great expectations of my performance or of a film. I try not to think about the outcome. If you look that far ahead, it sort of taints your choices as an actor. I try as hard as I can to believe that no one is ever going to see it and that it's not even a movie. Then you can allow yourself to bare more. Then, once a project is done, I tend to forget about it until it comes out. (Daily Telegraph, November 2007)
      I don't have a method to my madness... For me, acting is more about self-exploration. I've learned a lot about myself in order to learn about the craft. I've always been very big on self-exploration and answering my own questions. (Vanity Fair, 2000)
=======================================================
Heath Andrew Ledger (4 April 1979 – 22 January 2008) was an Australian actor and director. After performing roles in Australian television and film during the 1990s, Ledger left for the United States in 1998 to develop his film career. His work comprised nineteen films, including 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), The Patriot (2000), A Knight's Tale (2001), Monster's Ball (2001), Ned Kelly (2003), The Brothers Grimm (2005), Lords of Dogtown (2005), Brokeback Mountain (2005), Casanova (2005), Candy (2006), I'm Not There (2007), The Dark Knight (2008), and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009).[1] He also produced and directed music videos and aspired to be a film director.[2]
For his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in Brokeback Mountain, Ledger won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and Best International Actor from the Australian Film Institute, and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role[3] and for the Academy Award for Best Actor.[4] Posthumously he shared the 2007 Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award with the rest of the ensemble cast, the director, and the casting director for the film I'm Not There, which was inspired by the life and songs of American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. In the film, Ledger portrayed a fictional actor named Robbie Clark, one of six characters embodying aspects of Dylan's life and persona.[5]
Ledger died on 22 January 2008[4][6] from an accidental intoxication from prescription drugs.[7][8][9] A few months before his death, Ledger had finished filming his performance as the Joker in The Dark Knight. His death occurred during editing of The Dark Knight and in the midst of filming his last role as Tony in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. His untimely death cast a sombre shadow over the subsequent promotion of the $180 million Batman production.[10] Ledger received numerous posthumous accolades for his critically acclaimed performance in the film, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a Best Actor International Award at the 2008 Australian Film Institute Awards (for which he became the first actor to win an award posthumously),[11] the 2008 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor, the 2009 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture,[12] and the 2009 BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.[3]
Ledger was born on 4 April 1979 in Perth, Western Australia, the son of Sally Ledger (née Ramshaw), a teacher of the French language, and Kim Ledger, a racecar driver and mining engineer whose family established and owned the Ledger Engineering Foundry.[13] The Sir Frank Ledger Charitable Trust is named after his great-grandfather.[13] He had English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry.[14][15] Ledger attended Mary's Mount Primary School in Gooseberry Hill,[16] and later Guildford Grammar School, where he had his first acting experiences, starring in a school production as Peter Pan at age 10.[4][13] His parents separated when he was 10 and divorced when he was 11.[17] Ledger's older sister Kate, an actress and later a publicist, to whom he was very close, inspired his acting on stage, and his love of Gene Kelly inspired his successful choreography, leading to Guildford Grammar's 60-member team's "first all-boy victory" at the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge.[13][18] Heath's and Kate's other siblings include two half-sisters, Ashleigh Bell (b. 1990), his mother's daughter with her second husband and his stepfather Roger Bell, and Olivia Ledger (b. 1996), his father's daughter with second wife and his stepmother Emma Brown.[19]
After sitting for early graduation exams at 17, Ledger left school to pursue an acting career.[17] With Trevor DiCarlo, his best friend since he was three years old, Ledger drove across Australia from Perth to Sydney, returning to Perth to take a small role in Clowning Around (1992), the first part of a two-part television series, and to work on the TV series Sweat (1996), in which he played a gay cyclist.[13] From 1993 to 1997, Ledger also had parts in the Perth television series Ship to Shore (1993); in the short-lived Fox Broadcasting Company fantasy-drama Roar (1997); in Home and Away (1997), one of Australia's most successful television shows; and in the Australian film Blackrock (1997), his feature film debut.[13] In 1999, he starred in the teen comedy 10 Things I Hate About You and in the acclaimed Australian crime film Two Hands, directed by Gregor Jordan.[13]
From 2000 to 2005, he starred in supporting roles as Gabriel Martin, the eldest son of Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), in The Patriot (2000), and as Sonny Grotowski, the son of Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton), in Monster's Ball (2000); and in leading or title roles in A Knight's Tale (2001), The Four Feathers (2002), The Order (2003), Ned Kelly (2003), Casanova (2005), The Brothers Grimm (2005), and Lords of Dogtown (2005).[1] In 2001, he won a ShoWest Award as "Male Star of Tomorrow".[20]
Ledger received "Best Actor of 2005" awards from both the New York Film Critics Circle and the San Francisco Film Critics Circle for his performance in Brokeback Mountain,[21][22] in which he plays Wyoming ranch hand Ennis Del Mar, who has a love affair with aspiring rodeo rider Jack Twist, played by Jake Gyllenhaal.[23] He also received a nomination for Golden Globe Best Actor in a Drama and a nomination for Academy Award for Best Actor for this performance,[24][25] making him, at age 26, the ninth-youngest nominee for a Best Actor Oscar. In The New York Times review of the film, critic Stephen Holden writes: "Both Mr. Ledger and Mr. Gyllenhaal make this anguished love story physically palpable. Mr. Ledger magically and mysteriously disappears beneath the skin of his lean, sinewy character. It is a great screen performance, as good as the best of Marlon Brando and Sean Penn."[26] In a review in Rolling Stone, Peter Travers states: "Ledger's magnificent performance is an acting miracle. He seems to tear it from his insides. Ledger doesn't just know how Ennis moves, speaks and listens; he knows how he breathes. To see him inhale the scent of a shirt hanging in Jack's closet is to take measure of the pain of love lost."[27]
After Brokeback Mountain, Ledger costarred with fellow Australian Abbie Cornish in the 2006 Australian film Candy, an adaptation of the 1998 novel Candy: A Novel of Love and Addiction, as young heroin addicts in love attempting to break free of their addiction, whose mentor is played by Geoffrey Rush; for his performance as sometime poet Dan, Ledger was nominated for three "Best Actor" awards, including one of the Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards, which both Cornish and Rush won in their categories. Shortly after the release of Candy, Ledger was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[28] As one of six actors embodying different aspects of the life of Bob Dylan in the 2007 film I'm Not There, directed by Todd Haynes, Ledger "won praise for his portrayal of 'Robbie [Clark],' a moody, counter-culture actor who represents the romanticist side of Dylan, but says accolades are never his motivation."[29] Posthumously, on 23 February 2008, he shared the 2007 Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award with the rest of the film's ensemble cast, its director, and its casting director.[30]
In his penultimate film performance, Ledger played the Joker in Christopher Nolan's 2008 film The Dark Knight, released nearly six months after his death. While working on the film in London, Ledger told Sarah Lyall in their New York Times interview that he viewed The Dark Knight's Joker as a "psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy".[31] For his work on The Dark Knight, Ledger won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor with his family accepting it on his behalf, as well as numerous other posthumous awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor, which Christopher Nolan accepted for him.[32][33] At the time of his death on 22 January 2008, Ledger had completed about half of the work for his final film performance as Tony in Terry Gilliam's The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.[34][35] Gilliam chose to adapt the film after his death by having fellow actors Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell play "fantasy transformations" of his character so that Ledger's final performance could be seen in theatres.
Ledger had aspirations to become a film director and had made some music videos, which director Todd Haynes praised highly in his tribute to Ledger upon accepting the ISP Robert Altman Award, which Ledger posthumously shared, on 23 February 2008.[30] In 2006, Ledger directed music videos for the title track on Australian hip hop artist N'fa's CD debut solo album Cause An Effect[36] and for the single "Seduction Is Evil (She's Hot)".[37][38] Later that year, Ledger inaugurated a new record label, Masses Music, with singer Ben Harper and also directed a music video for Harper's song "Morning Yearning".[31][39]
At a news conference at the 2007 Venice Film Festival, Ledger spoke of his desire to make a documentary film about the British singer-songwriter Nick Drake, who died in 1974, at the age of 26, from an overdose of an antidepressant.[40] Ledger created and acted in a music video set to Drake's recording of the singer's 1974 song about depression "Black Eyed Dog" – a title "inspired by Winston Churchill’s descriptive term for depression" (black dog);[41] it was shown publicly only twice, first at the Bumbershoot Festival, in Seattle, held from 1 to 3 September 2007; and secondly as part of "A Place To Be: A Celebration of Nick Drake", with its screening of Their Place: Reflections On Nick Drake, "a series of short filmed homages to Nick Drake" (including Ledger's), sponsored by American Cinematheque, at the Grauman's Egyptian Theatre, in Hollywood, on 5 October 2007.[42] After Ledger's death, his music video for "Black Eyed Dog" was shown on the Internet and excerpted in news clips distributed via YouTube.[40][43][44][45]
He was working with Scottish screenwriter and producer Allan Scott on an adaptation of the 1983 novel The Queen's Gambit by Walter Tevis, which would have been his first feature film as a director. He also intended to act in the film, with Canadian actress Ellen Page proposed in the lead role.[2][46][47] Ledger's final directorial work, in which he shot two music videos before his death, premiered in 2009.[48] The music videos, completed for Modest Mouse and Grace Woodroofe,[49] include an animated feature for Modest Mouse's song, "King Rat", and the Woodroofe video for her cover of David Bowie's "Quicksand".[50] The "King Rat" video premiered on 4 August 2009.[51]
Ledger was an avid chess player, winning Western Australia's junior chess championship at the age of 10.[52] As an adult, he often played with other chess enthusiasts at Washington Square Park.[53] Allan Scott's film adaptation of the chess-related 1983 novel The Queen's Gambit, by Walter Tevis, which at the time of his death he was planning to both perform in and direct, would have been Ledger's first feature film as a director.[2][46]
Ledger had relationships with actresses Lisa Zane, Heather Graham and Naomi Watts.[citation needed] In the summer of 2004, he met and began dating actress Michelle Williams on the set of Brokeback Mountain, and their daughter, Matilda Rose, was born on 28 October 2005 in New York City.[54] Matilda's godparents are Ledger and Williams' Brokeback co-star Jake Gyllenhaal and Williams' Dawson's Creek castmate Busy Philipps.[55] In January 2006, Ledger put his residence in Bronte, New South Wales up for sale,[56] and returned to the United States, where he shared a house with Williams, in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, from 2005 to 2007.[57] In September 2007, Williams' father confirmed to Sydney's Daily Telegraph that Ledger and Williams had ended their relationship.[58]
After his break-up with Williams, in late 2007 and early 2008, the tabloid press and other public media linked Ledger romantically with supermodels Helena Christensen and Gemma Ward. On 30 January 2011, Gemma Ward stated that the pair began dating in November 2007 and their families spent Christmas together in their home town of Perth.[59][60][61][62][63][64] He and actress Lindsay Lohan were very close friends.[64] Lindsay said she was heartbroken when she learned of Ledger's death.
Ledger's relationship with the press in Australia was sometimes turbulent, and it led to his abandonment of plans for his family to reside part-time in Sydney.[65][66] In 2004, he strongly denied press reports alleging that "he spat at journalists on the Sydney set of the film Candy," or that one of his relatives had done so later, outside Ledger's Sydney home.[65][66] On 13 January 2006, "Several members of the paparazzi retaliated ... squirting Ledger and Williams with water pistols on the red carpet at the Sydney premiere of Brokeback Mountain."[67][68]
After his performance on stage at the 2005 Screen Actors Guild Awards, when he had giggled in presenting Brokeback Mountain as a nominee for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, the Los Angeles Times referred to his presentation as an "apparent gay spoof."[69] Ledger called the Times later and explained that his levity resulted from stage fright, saying that he had been told that he would be presenting the award only minutes earlier; he stated: "I am so sorry and I apologise for my nervousness. I would be absolutely horrified if my stage fright was misinterpreted as a lack of respect for the film, the topic and for the amazing filmmakers."[70][71]
Ledger was quoted in January 2006 in Melbourne's Herald Sun as saying that he heard that West Virginia had banned Brokeback Mountain, which it had not; actually, a cinema in Utah had banned the film.[72] He had also referred mistakenly to West Virginia's having had lynchings as recently as the 1980s, but state scholars disputed his statement, observing that, whereas lynchings did occur in Alabama as recently as 1981, according to "the director of state archives and history" quoted in The Charleston Gazette, "The last documented lynching in West Virginia took place in Lewisburg in 1931."[73]
In their New York Times interview, published on 4 November 2007, Ledger told Sarah Lyall that his recently completed roles in I'm Not There (2007) and The Dark Knight (2008) had taken a toll on his ability to sleep: "Last week I probably slept an average of two hours a night. ... I couldn't stop thinking. My body was exhausted, and my mind was still going."[74] At that time, he told Lyall that he had taken two Ambien pills, after taking just one had not sufficed, and those left him in "a stupor, only to wake up an hour later, his mind still racing."[31]
Prior to his return to New York from his last film assignment, in London, in January 2008, while he was apparently suffering from some kind of respiratory illness, he reportedly complained to his co-star from The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, Christopher Plummer, that he was continuing to have difficulty sleeping and taking pills to help with that problem: "Confirming earlier reports that Ledger hadn't been feeling well on set, Plummer says, 'we all caught colds because we were shooting outside on horrible, damp nights. But Heath's went on and I don't think he dealt with it immediately with the antibiotics.... I think what he did have was the walking pneumonia.' [...] On top of that, 'He was saying all the time, 'dammit, I can't sleep'... and he was taking all these pills to help him.' "[75]
In talking with Interview magazine, after his death Ledger's former fiancée Michelle Williams also confirmed reports the actor had experienced trouble sleeping. "For as long as I'd known him, he had bouts with insomnia. He had too much energy. His mind was turning, turning, turning – always turning."[76]
At about 2:45 pm (EST), on 22 January 2008, Ledger was found unconscious in his bed by his housekeeper, Teresa Solomon, and his masseuse, Diana Wolozin, in his fourth-floor loft apartment at 421 Broome Street in the SoHo neighbourhood of Manhattan.[4][6]
According to the police, Wolozin, who had arrived early for a 3:00 pm appointment with Ledger, called Ledger's friend, actress Mary-Kate Olsen, for help. Olsen, who was in California, directed a New York City private security guard to go to the scene. At 3:26 pm, "less than 15 minutes after she first saw him in bed and only a few moments after the first call to Ms. Olsen", Wolozin telephoned 9-1-1 "to say that Mr. Ledger was not breathing". At the urging of the 9-1-1 operator, Wolozin administered CPR, which was unsuccessful in reviving him.[77]
Paramedics and emergency medical technicians arrived seven minutes later, at 3:33 pm ("at almost exactly the same moment as a private security guard summoned by Ms. Olsen") but were also unable to revive him.[6][77][78] At 3:36 pm, Ledger was pronounced dead, and his body was removed from the apartment.[6][77]
Two weeks later on 6 February 2008, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York released its conclusions, based on an initial autopsy of 23 January 2008 and a subsequent complete toxicological analysis.[7][79][80] The report concludes, in part, "Mr. Heath Ledger died as the result of acute intoxication by the combined effects of oxycodone, hydrocodone, diazepam, temazepam, alprazolam and doxylamine."[7][9] It states definitively: "We have concluded that the manner of death is accident, resulting from the abuse of prescription medications."[7][9]
While the medications found in the toxicological analysis may be prescribed in the United States for insomnia, anxiety, pain, or common cold (doxylamine) symptoms, the vast majority of physicians in the US are extremely reluctant to prescribe multiple benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, alprazolam, and temazepam) to a single patient, let alone prescribe the same to a patient already taking a mix of oxycodone and hydrocodone. Although the Associated Press and other media reported that "police estimate Ledger's time of death between 1 pm and 2:45 pm" (on 22 January 2008),[81] the Medical Examiner's Office announced that it would not be publicly disclosing the official estimated time of death.[82][83] The official announcement of the cause and manner of Ledger's death heightened concerns about the growing problems of prescription drug abuse or misuse and combined drug intoxication (CDI).[8][80][84]
Late in February 2008, a DEA investigation of medical professionals relating to Ledger's death exonerated two American physicians, who practise in Los Angeles and Houston, of any wrongdoing, determining that "the doctors in question had prescribed Ledger other medications – not the pills that killed him."[85][86]
On 4 August 2008, citing unnamed sources, Murray Weiss, of the New York Post, first reported that Mary-Kate Olsen had "refused [through her attorney, Michael C. Miller] to be interviewed by federal investigators probing the accidental drug death of her close friend Heath Ledger ... [without] ... immunity from prosecution" and that, when asked about the matter, Miller at first declined further comment.[87][88] Later that day, after the police confirmed the gist of Weiss's account to the Associated Press, Miller issued a statement denying that Olsen supplied Ledger with the drugs causing his death and asserting that she did not know their source.[89][90] In his statement, Miller said specifically, "Despite tabloid speculation, Mary-Kate Olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in Heath Ledger's home or his body, and she does not know where he obtained them," emphasising that media "descriptions [attributed to an unidentified source] are incomplete and inaccurate."[91]
After a flurry of further media speculation, on 6 August 2008, the US Attorney's Office in Manhattan closed its investigation into Ledger's death without filing any charges and rendering moot its subpoena of Olsen.[92][93] With the clearing of the two doctors and Olsen, and the closing of the investigation because the prosecutors in the Manhattan US Attorney's Office "don't believe there's a viable target," it is still not known how Ledger obtained the oxycodone and hydrocodone in the lethal drug combination that killed him.[93][94]
Eleven months after Ledger's death, on 23 December 2008, Jake Coyle, writing for the Associated Press, announced that "Heath Ledger's death was voted 2008's top entertainment story by U.S. newspaper and broadcast editors surveyed by The Associated Press" because it resulted in "shock and confusion" about "the circumstances", the ruling of the death as an accident caused by "a toxic combination of prescription drugs", and the continuation of "his legacy... [i]n a roundly acclaimed performance as the Joker in the year's biggest box office hit The Dark Knight."[95]
After Ledger's death, in response to some press reports about his will, filed in New York City on 28 February 2008,[96][97] and his daughter's access to his financial legacy, his father, Kim Ledger, said that he considered the financial well-being of his granddaughter Matilda Rose the Ledger family's "absolute priority" and her mother, Michelle Williams, "an integral part of our family", adding "They will be taken care of and that's how Heath would want it to be".[98] Some of Ledger's relatives may be challenging the legal status of his will signed in 2003, prior to his involvement with Williams and the birth of their daughter and not updated to include them, which divides half of his estate between his parents and half among his siblings; they claim that there is a second, unsigned will, which leaves most of that estate to Matilda Rose.[99][100] Williams' father, Larry Williams, has also joined the controversy about Ledger's will as it was filed in New York City soon after his death.[101]
On 31 March 2008, stimulating another controversy pertaining to Ledger's estate, Gemma Jones and Janet Fife-Yeomans published an "Exclusive" report, in The Daily Telegraph, citing Ledger's uncle Haydn Ledger and other family members, who "believe the late actor may have fathered a secret love child" when he was 17, and stating that "If it is confirmed that Ledger is the girl's biological father, it could split his multi-million dollar estate between ... Matilda Rose ... and his secret love child."[102][103][104] A few days later, reports citing telephone interviews with Ledger's uncles Haydn and Mike Ledger and the family of the other little girl, published in OK! and Us Weekly, "denied" those "claims", with Ledger's uncles and the little girl's mother and stepfather describing them as unfounded "rumors" distorted and exaggerated by the media.[105][106]
On 15 July 2008, Fife-Yeomans reported further, via Australian News Limited, that "While Ledger left everything to his parents and three sisters, it is understood they have legal advice that under Western Australia law, Matilda Rose is entitled to the lion's share" of his estate; its executors, Kim Ledger's former business colleague Robert John Collins and Geraldton accountant William Mark Dyson, "have applied for probate in the West Australian Supreme Court in Perth, advertising for 'creditors and other persons' having claims on the estate to lodge them by 11 August 2008 ... to ensure all debts are paid before the estate is distributed...."[107] According to this report by Fife-Yeomans, earlier reports citing Ledger's uncles,[98] and subsequent reports citing Ledger's father, which do not include his actual posthumous earnings, "his entire fortune, mostly held in Australian trusts, is likely to be worth up to $20 million."[107][108][109]
On 27 September 2008, Ledger's father Kim stated that "the family has agreed to leave the US$16.3 million fortune to Matilda," adding: "There is no claim. Our family has gifted everything to Matilda."[108][109][110] In October 2008, Forbes estimated Ledger's annual earnings from October 2007 through October 2008 – including his posthumous share of The Dark Knight's gross income of "US$991 million in box office revenue worldwide" –– as "US$20 million."[111]
As the news of Ledger's death became public, throughout the night of 22 January 2008, and the next day, media crews, mourners, fans, and other onlookers began gathering outside his apartment building, with some leaving flowers or other memorial tributes.[112][113]
The next day, at 10:50 am, Australian time, Ledger's parents and sister appeared outside his mother's house in Applecross, a riverside suburb of Perth, and read a short statement to the media expressing their grief and desire for privacy.[114] Within the next few days, memorial tributes were communicated by family members, Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd, Deputy Premier of Western Australia Eric Ripper, Warner Bros. (distributor of The Dark Knight), and thousands of Ledger's fans around the world.[115][116][117][118]
Several actors made statements expressing their sorrow at Ledger's death, including Daniel Day-Lewis, who dedicated his Screen Actors Guild Award to Ledger, saying that he was inspired by Ledger's acting; Day-Lewis praised Ledger's performances in Monster's Ball and Brokeback Mountain, describing the latter as "unique, perfect."[119][120] Verne Troyer, who was working with Ledger on The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus at the time of his death, had a heart shape, an exact duplicate of a symbol that Ledger scrawled on a piece of paper with his email address, tattooed on his hand in remembrance of Ledger because Ledger "had made such an impression on [him]."[121]
On 1 February, in her first public statement after Ledger's death, Michelle Williams expressed her heartbreak and described Ledger's spirit as surviving in their daughter.[122][123]
After attending private memorial ceremonies in Los Angeles, Ledger's family members returned with his body to Perth.[124][125]
On 9 February, a memorial service attended by several hundred invited guests was held at Penrhos College, garnering considerable press attention; afterward Ledger's body was cremated at Fremantle Cemetery, followed by a private service attended by only 10 closest family members,[126][127][128] with his ashes interred later in a family plot at Karrakatta Cemetery, next to two of his grandparents.[125][129][130] Later that night, his family and friends gathered for a wake on Cottesloe Beach.[131][132][133]
In January 2011, the State Theatre Centre of Western Australia in Ledger's home town of Perth named a 575-seat theatre the Heath Ledger Theatre after him. For the opening of the theatre, Ledger's Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor was on display in the theatre's foyer along with his Joker costume.[134]
Ledger's death affected the marketing campaign for Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008)[10][34] and also both the production and marketing of Terry Gilliam's film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, with both directors intending to celebrate and pay tribute to his work in these films.[34][35][135][136] Although Gilliam temporarily suspended production on the latter film,[35] he expressed determination to "salvage" it, perhaps using computer-generated imagery (CGI), and dedicated it to Ledger.[75][137][138] In February 2008, as a "memorial tribute to the man many have called one of the best actors of his generation," Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell signed on to take over Ledger's role, becoming multiple incarnations of his character, Tony, transformed in this "magical re-telling of the Faust story,"[139][140][141] and the three actors have donated their fees for the film to Ledger's and Williams's daughter.[142]
Speaking of editing The Dark Knight, on which Ledger had completed his work in October 2007, Nolan recalled, "It was tremendously emotional, right when he passed, having to go back in and look at him every day. ... But the truth is, I feel very lucky to have something productive to do, to have a performance that he was very, very proud of, and that he had entrusted to me to finish."[136] All of Ledger's scenes appear as he completed them in the filming; in editing the film, Nolan added no "digital effects" to alter Ledger's actual performance posthumously.[143] Nolan dedicated the film in part to Ledger's memory, as well as to the memory of technician Conway Wickliffe, who was killed during a car accident while preparing one of the film's stunts.[144]
Released in July 2008, The Dark Knight broke several box office records and received both popular and critical accolades, especially with regard to Ledger's performance as the Joker.[145] Even film critic David Denby, who does not praise the film overall in his pre-release review in The New Yorker, evaluates Ledger's work highly, describing his performance as both "sinister and frightening" and Ledger as "mesmerising in every scene", concluding: "His performance is a heroic, unsettling final act: this young actor looked into the abyss."[146] Attempting to dispel widespread speculations that Ledger's performance as the Joker had in any way led to his death (as Denby and others suggest), Ledger's co-star and friend Christian Bale, who played opposite him as Batman, has stressed that, as an actor, Ledger greatly enjoyed meeting the challenges of creating that role, an experience that Ledger himself described as "the most fun I’ve ever had, or probably ever will have, playing a character."[10][147] Terry Gilliam also refuted the claims that playing the Joker made him crazy, calling it "absolute nonsense" and going on to say, "Heath was so solid. His feet were on the ground and he was the least neurotic person I’ve ever met."[148]
Ledger received numerous awards for his Joker role in The Dark Knight. On 10 November 2008, he was nominated for two People's Choice Awards related to his work on the film, "Best Ensemble Cast" and "Best Onscreen Match-Up" (shared with Christian Bale), and Ledger won an award for "Match-Up" in the ceremony aired live on CBS in January 2009.[149]
On 11 December 2008, it was announced that Ledger had been nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture for his performance as the Joker in The Dark Knight; he subsequently won the award at the 66th Golden Globe Awards ceremony telecast on NBC on 11 January 2009 with Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan accepting on his behalf.[12][32]
Film critics, co-stars Maggie Gyllenhaal and Michael Caine and many of Ledger's colleagues in the film community joined Bale in calling for and predicting a nomination for the 2008 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in recognition of Ledger's achievement in The Dark Knight.[150] Ledger's subsequent nomination was announced on 22 January 2009, the anniversary of his death;[151] Ledger went on to win the award, becoming the second person to win a posthumous Academy Award for acting, after fellow Australian actor Peter Finch, who won for 1976's Network, and the first comic-book movie to win an Oscar for acting. The award was accepted by Ledger's family.[33]

=======================================================
1979April 04Heath's Early YearsLedger is born in the beachfront town of Perth, Australia. His dad, Kim, an engineer who designed race cars, and mom, Sally, a French teacher, divorce when Ledger is 11. The budding actor – who's already working regularly in community theater – adapts easily to shuttling between his parents' homes. "It set me up for this bohemian life I've been leading," he tells Rolling Stone in 2006. "I feel like I've been traveling with the same bag since I was 11."1995Roaring AwayAt 16, Ledger, who says he "hates school," leaves home for Sydney, where he appears in the Aussie TV show Sweat. He also makes his feature film debut in Blackrock and takes the lead in Roar (left), Fox's new warrior drama – costarring Keri Russell. "It started off quite dignified and Braveheart-esque," Ledger tells Rolling Stone of the short-lived series. "But as they got desperate for ratings, slowly no one's wearing clothes." On the upside, he dates costar Lisa Zane (the sister of Titanic's Billy Zane), who's 18 years his senior. 199810 Things HeartthrobLedger hops a flight to Hollywood and lands the lead in 10 Things I Hate About You, opposite Julia Stiles (right). The teen comedy rakes in more than $50 million, but Ledger admits he's unhappy being labeled a heartthrob. "I was a young kid from Australia, and that was the only movie someone was willing to put me in, so what do you do?" he tells the Houston Chronicle. "You've got to start somewhere. I just didn't want to stay there." He adamantly turns down teen flicks for the next year.2000Mad for MelLedger stars as Mel Gibson's son in the Revolutionary War drama The Patriot (left). The movie hauls in $113 million and earns the 21-year-old his first taste of critical acclaim. Rolling Stone declares, "The Aussie newcomer has the talent and looks to become a major star." Ledger also lands on the cover of August’s Vanity Fair for a story breathlessly headlined, "We’re Havin' A Heath Wave." SummerHeath & Heather GrahamWhile in Prague shooting A Knight's Tale, Ledger meets bombshell Heather Graham (right), who's also in Prague filming From Hell. "She's a beautiful, beautiful girl," he tells Movieline of the actress who's nine years his senior. "We make each other laugh – she's so f--king funny. That's the key. It's fun. It's a good relationship and a very truthful one." The two date for about a year before splitting in June 2001.2001Bright KnightFresh from being named one of PEOPLE's 50 Most Beautiful, Ledger's stars in A Knight's Tale (right). The comedy-adventure rakes in $117 million worldwide. "Once every 50 years, a guy like [Heath] comes along," director Brian Helgeland tells Vanity Fair. 2001 - 2003Taking the 'Blond Out'After the overwhelming success of his first few films, Ledger signs on to a string of bombs, including Ned Kelly, an epic costarring Orlando Bloom that earns just $84,625 in the U.S. "I wanted to take the blond out of my career, kill the direction it was going in," he tells Rolling Stone. "Whether consciously or unconsciously, I perfectly sabotaged any studio interest in working with me." The dark period has two highlights: playing Billy Bob Thornton's suicidal son in Monster's Ball; and dating his Ned Kelly costar Naomi Watts (left), who's 11 years his senior. Ledger and Watts date on-and-off for two years.2004January'The Gay Cowboy Movie'Ledger signs on to star in Brokeback Mountain, a love story about two cowboys. The screenplay, long known as simply "The Gay Cowboy Movie," had bounced around Hollywood before landing in the hands of director Ang Lee. "My biggest anxiety wasn't having to kiss Jake," Ledger (pictured with Lee and costar Jake Gyllenhaal) tells Rolling Stone. "It was the perfect script and Ang Lee was the perfect director. So the anxiety for me was – I didn't want to be the one to f--k it up."SummerFalling for Michelle WilliamsOn the very first day of filming Brokeback, Ledger falls for costar Michelle Williams (left). "On the 5th take, Michelle and I [are] tobogganing down the hill..." he tells Rolling Stone. "And Michelle...twisted her knee – she was pretty much on crutches for the rest of the shoot. And I felt I always had to look after her after that." In May, PEOPLE reports that Ledger and Williams are expecting a baby. The pregnancy, Ledger tells Rolling Stone, is a surprise: "Our bodies definitely made those decisions for us." The two move into a brownstone in Brooklyn and begin nesting. 2005October 28Welcome, Matilda RoseWilliams gives birth to their daughter, Matilda Rose (right). Ledger seems to revel in fatherhood. "I'm Mr. Mom," he tells the Boston Globe. "I get [Michelle] granola and cook her an egg, I clean the dishes, and then I'm cooking lunch. Later, I go out to the market and get fresh produce for dinner. And I love it! I love my new job."

=======================================================
Australian born actor Heath Ledger tread the delicate line between Hollywood movie-star and brooding artist until his tragic death at the age of 28 in January 2008. Launched to success as a teen heartthrob in his early films such as ‘Ten Things I Hate About You’ (1999), Ledger’s career progressed to more challenging roles including gay cowboy Ennis Del Mar in ‘Brokeback Mountain’ and the Joker ine ‘The Dark Knight’ (2008). Refusing to be defined solely by his good looks, Ledger pursued new challenges with each role he took on and his untimely death has extinguished a rising star that looked set to break the mould.
On 4 April 1979, French teacher Sally Ledger Bell gave birth to her second child, Heath Andrew Ledger, in Perth, Western Australia. Sally's first child to then-husband, racing car driver and mining engineer Kim Ledger, had been named Catherine, shortened in time to Kate, after the heroine of Emily Bronte's classic 'Wuthering Heights'.Continuing in this fashion, she named her son after the other main character of the novel, Heathcliff.Later, after Sally and Kim were to separate, Ledger gained two half sisters, Ashleigh from his mother's second marriage and Olivia from that of his father. He was always very close to his family and even had KAOS, the initials of his mother and three sisters, tattooed onto his wrist.Throughout his youth, Ledger excelled in a variety of sports including Australian Rules Football, hockey, surfing, skateboarding and go-karting. He was also a keen chess player, winning the Western Australian Junior Chess Championships at only ten-years-old, a hobby he would later revisit going to play chess in Washington Square Park.Whilst we know that he fell prey to the acting bug early, less well-known is that he also had a keen interest in dance, inspired by the all-singing and dancing Gene Kelly. Ledger was captivated by the man's strong spirit, later explaining in an interview that Kelly could 'bring light to the screen and just fill it up. I remind myself of his spirit sometimes when I need to push on through a particular scene.'At first glance, it would be easy to see the high achieving Ledger as simply gifted, but he himself would probably argue that his supportive family was the greatest gift life gave him. To label these achievements under talent would also neglect the fact that from a young age he learned to work hard and take risks – skills which would serve him well in the years to come, though arguably contributing to his ultimate downfall, as he continued to push beyond his own limits.Older sister Kate shared her love of performance with her brother and encouraged him to take on stage roles as school, but Ledger took this burgeoning passion and interest in dance even further, choreographing a show for 60 boys from his school, Guildford Grammar, which won Australia's prestigious Rock Eisteddford Challenge.
Kate played a more direct, albeit accidental role in starting Ledger's professional acting career, for it was while tagging along with his sister to a casting agent's office that he was given the once over and also invited to audition. Like any sensible kid, he did, and promptly landed a role as gay cyclist Snowy Bowles in teenage drama 'Sweat' (1996).Although the show itself was forgettable at best, the bold role began Ledger's professional career and was groundbreaking at the time, presaging Ledger's next turn as a gay man, which would launch his career as a box-office star.Also in 1996, Ledger auditioned for the lead role in an Australian/US co-production TV series called 'Roar'. He was flown to LA for follow-up auditions, which he thought he had nervously made a mess of, yet despite his misgivings and being the youngest actor auditioned, he landed the part of Conor, a spirited young Irish man who rallies folks to his cause in order to rid the Celtic lands of evil. 'Roar' itself was not so well received, but this heroic and handsome young man dashing about on horseback dressed in sparse leather and enthusiastically slaying foes with his mighty sword certainly was.The series was axed after its first season, and Ledger promptly went on to do a prerequisite stint on the Australian soap 'Home and Away', the early stamping ground of countless young future Australia stars. Shortly after, he packed up his Australian life to follow his 'Roar' co-star and now girlfriend Lisa Zane (older sister to Billy) to Los Angeles.It was in Hollywood that Ledger achieved a series of roles in the teen genre, appearing in the 1999 hit 'Ten Things I Hate About You' a send-up of Shakespeare's 'The Taming of the Shrew' in which he appeared opposite Julia Stiles. A spate in the light hearted 'A Knight’s Tale' (1999) didn't break the mould but Ledger even at this time was rigorously self-critical, reportedly walking out of an audition for Mel Gibsons' 'The Patriot' (2000).He was nevertheless given the role thanks to Gibson, who recognised a talent when he saw one; a leap of faith he was later to repeat with Robert Downey Jr in 2003.As his career progressed, Ledger passed up offers for similar roles in other teen films, later saying in a 2007 interview "I feel like I’m wasting time if I repeat myself." At times, this commitment to integrity meant passing up on paycheques and Ledger even ended up borrowing from his agent, describing later in an interview with The Evening Standard: "I was literally living off ramen noodles and water, because I was sticking to my game."A host of films followed Ledger's appearance in 'The Patriot' with a turn as troubled sheriff's son in 'Monster's Ball' (2001) and an Australian bandit in 'Ned Kelly'(2003), where he formed a romantic relationship with his co-star Naomi Watts. He also starred in 'Two Hands' in 1999 and played a heroic 19th century soldier in 'Four Feathers' in 2003.By this stage, Ledger had made his mark on the Hollywood acting A-list. Gregor Jordan, the director of 'Ned Kelly', who had previously directed Ledger in 'Two Hands', stated that "for leading men under 25 there's Leonardo DiCaprio, whose salary is stratospheric, and then basically there's just Heath Ledger and Josh Hartnett." Of the thousands of young men clamouring to be Hollywood's next hot big thing, there were but three names on the list and Ledger's was one of them.But it was Ledger's role in the film 'Brokeback Mountain' in 2005 that led to the Academy Award nomination for 'Best Actor' and widespread critical acclaim, playing one half of a thwarted gay love story opposite Jake Gyllenhaal. The New York Times wrote of his performance: "as good as the best of Marlon Brando and Sean Penn."
The critical acclaim that this film received was new to Ledger as his other movies of that year were not viewed as positively, including 'Lords of Dogtown', 'The Brothers Grimm' and 'Casanova' alongside Sienna Miller.The film was also where Ledger met Michelle Williams and the couple swiftly became a frequent feature of the celebrity-gossip pages and blogs. In fact, paparazzi intrusion in his home country of Australia got so bad that Ledger left the country to live in Brooklyn, New York, where Williams gave birth to their daughter Matilda Rose on 28 October 2005.After 'Brokeback Mountain', Ledger became an instantly bankable name, such that he was able to be selective about the many offers now knocking at his door. As such, he looked to take on more interesting and challenging roles, including a young heroin addict in 'Candy' (2006), starring alongside Abbie Cornish and Geoffrey Rush, and a troubled actor Robbie Clark in 'I'm Not There' (2007), embodying one of seven aspects of the legendary Bob Dylan.The birth of his daughter would prove to be a brief time of stability for the actor as he reportedly became a homebody, staying at home in Brooklyn with Michelle and Matilda Rose, saying in an interview: "The level of synchronicity in my life now, with me and Michelle and now Matilda, (has) meant it's become everything to me - the most important thing I do," he said of caring for his family.But this much searched for balance proved short-lived and whilst the actor's screen career seemed to be going from strength to strength, his personal life began to look increasingly troubled. In his penultimate film before his death, Ledger took on the dark and complex role of the Joker in Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight.' Previously immortalised by Jack Nicholson who reportedly 'warned' Ledger on the possible strains that came with taking on such a role, Ledger himself spent considerable time preparing for the part, seeing the Joker as a "psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy."Whilst playing the role, Ledger reportedly had trouble sleeping, describing in an interview how he often only got two hours sleep and frequently resorted to sleeping pills: "I couldn't stop thinking. My body was exhausted, and my mind was still going." His relationship with Williams also broke down and it wasn't long before he was romantically linked in the tabloids to a number of famous women including Helena Christensen, Gemma Ward and finally former child star Mary-Kate Olsen who was to be contacted by authorities on the day he died.It is ironic that at a time when Ledger was evidently struggling off the screen, his performances on screen have been lauded as arguably his greatest, particularly The Joker, described by 'The Dark Knight' director Nolan as "iconic" and New York Times film critic David Denby, as "mesmerising in every scene" with a performance both "sinister and frightening" yet also a "heroic, unsettling final act: this young actor looked into the abyss."On 22 January 2008, Ledger was found dead in the Soho apartment where he had been living for several weeks. An autopsy reported the cause of death as 'acute intoxication', found to be the result of a deadly combination of prescription pills, and a later coroner's report declared the death as 'accidental' although there remain rumours of suicide.
Neighbours interviewed at the time expressed dismay and surprise at the news of his death - one hairdresser who owned a salon several doors away told that she used to see Ledger once or twice a week and had twice seen him going on walks with his young daughter. "I think it's really sad," Ms McIntosh said. "He's a really nice guy. He seemed happy."Before he died, Ledger was half way through the filming of 'The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus' directed by Terry Gilliam. Having been cast as the role of Tony, Ledger's part was subsequently recast to have new actors portray his "physically transformed versions" in different realms, including Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell.For many who knew the actor, what is left is a sense of regret at an unfulfilled promise Ledger was destined to realise. His death at the age of 28 looks set to cast him alongside James Dean, Montgomery Clift and Marilyn Monroe within the cult of beautiful stars who died too young."I had such great hope for him," Gibson said in the wake of Ledger's death, "He was just taking off and to lose his life at such a young age is a tragic loss."On 9 February 2008, a memorial service attended by several hundred guests was held at Penhros College in Perth, Australia. His body was cremated at the Fremantle Cemetery after which ten members of his closest family attended a private service. They interred his ashes next to his grandparents and held a wake on Cottesloe Beach that evening.After Ledger's death, 'The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus', which was released in 2009, was dedicated to the actor. Nolan also partly dedicated the 'Dark Knight' to Ledger alongside a technician who had died in a car accident before its release.On 10 November 2008, it was announced that Ledger had been nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe for his role as the Joker, which he subsequently won on 11 January 2009, with Nolan accepting on his behalf.Following the Golden Globe win, film critics and his co-stars including Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Michael Caine called for an Oscar nomination. Ledger's Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination was announced on 22 January 2009 - the anniversary of his death.Ledger became the second person to win a posthumous Oscar for acting, with his family picking up the award.

Birth Name: Heath Andrew LedgerBirth Place: Perth, Western Australia, AustraliaDate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 04/04/1979, AriesDate of Death: 01/22/2008Profession: Actor
Although the short-lived series Roar introduced this hunky actor to American audiences (as well as his ex-girlfriend, costar Lisa Zane), this Aussie player was already well-known in his homeland. His winning turn as a witty rebel with a full head of sexy locks in 1999 romantic comedy 10 Things I Hate About You made him a teen heartthrob, and Hollywood earmarked him as the next big thing. Yet after a couple of blockbusters---the Revolutionary War drama The Patriot and the medieval action-fest A Knight's Tale---his star receded in a string of pricey, high-profile flops, including The Four Feathers, The Order and Ned Kelly (which introduced him to ex-girlfriend Naomi Watts). By the mid-2000s, Ledger's career was on the rocks, although his on-again, off-again relationship with Watts kept him in the tabloids. But in 2005, he seemed to be getting back on track, both personally and professionally: Not only did he win rave reviews as well as Golden Globe and Oscar nods for his compelling performance as a gay cowboy in the critically and commercially successful Brokeback Mountain, he also fathered a baby girl with his costar-cum-fiancée, Michelle Williams. Although that relationship ended in 2007, fans assumed he was riding high and looking forward to the 2008 release of The Dark Knight, in which he played The Joker opposite Christian Bale's Batman. Ledger's promising career was cut short, though, when in January 2008, the 28-year-old was found dead in his Manhattan bedroom of what was ruled an accidental drug overdose. However, Ledger did appear on the big screen once more the following year. At the time of his death, he had been filming director Terry Gilliam's fantasy The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, and with some tweaks to the story, Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law were able to step into Ledger's role, enabling the film to be completed.Heath Ledger Fast Facts:

'I look at that beach and I can tell you where each one was lying...   I can still see their faces': Tears of D-Day veterans as they make emotional return to Normandy to honour their fallen comrades
        Former soldiers from Britain and the US stood alongside other heroes as they recalled the harrowing day in 1944. Many were seen saluting at the gravestones of their friends while others wiped tears from their eyes as they listened to speeches made during the commemoration services. Harold Baumgarten, 89, described how he could look out at the beaches of northern France and point to where the bodies lay. The former US soldier was just 19 years old when he jumped off the landing craft and, 70 years on, has paid tribute to the 9,387 Americans who fell during the invasion, suggesting they are the reason he arrived safely back home.

He made girls drool since his Australian acting debut and it didn't take long for North America to catch the Heath Ledger bug either. Find out more about the fascinating life and tragic death of this young actor.
Heath Ledger wasn't a one-track kinda guy. Sure, he was captain of the drama team in high school, but Heath also won several awards for hockey and he even coordinated a group of guys to compete in a dance competition, which he won. Luckily for movie-goers, this Aussie decided to take up acting as his main profession. After graduating high school a year early (at age 16) Heath Ledger and his best bud, Tony DiCarlo, drove 2600 miles from Perth, Australia to Sydney. 
Heath Ledger got his first break with the Australian teen flick, Blackrock, in 1997. The role gained him a lot of positive attention and Heath soon snagged the part of an Olympic hopeful on the Australian TV show Sweat. For the show, Heath Ledger had the option of playing either the straight swimmer or the gay cyclist and he chose the gay role because it would require more "acting" and probably give him more recognition. It was a smart move that led to Heath Ledger's fist US gig, as a Celtic Prince in the Fox drama  Roar, which also starred Keri Russell as his wife.
Heath Ledger was still a relative unknown until he landed the lead in 10 Things I Hate About You, costarring Julia Stiles. More than a year later Heath Ledger landed the role of Gabriel, Mel Gibson's oldest son in The Patriot. Heath Ledger went on to star in movies like A Knight's Tale, Monster's Ball, and The Order. He also starred in Lords of Dogtown and Brokeback Mountain, which earned him an Academy Award nomination. In the summer of 2008, Heath can be seen in his final performance, playing the Joker in the latest Batman remake The Dark Knight.
Heath dated King Kong actress Noami Watts for two years before hooking up with Dawson's Creek alumni and fellow Brokeback Mountain co-star Michelle Williams.  In 2005 they had a daughter, named Matilda Rose.  Michelle and Heath separated in 2007, blaming both of their busy schedules for straining the relationship.  Sadly, on January 22, 2008 at the age of 28, Heath Ledger was found dead in a New York apartment building.  Early reports say drugs may have played a role.
Heath Ledger and his sister, Kate, were named after the leads in the Emily Bronte novel Wuthering Heights.
"I'm the worst auditioner - really, really bad. I mean, you're being judged and I'm just so aware of it that it consumes me. I can't relax, I'm tied in knots, so the voice is very taut and tense." 
I literally cannot wait to see this movie!! It comes out tomorrow, but I already have my tickets of course. I've read the book 7 times already, and I cry every single time. The story and characters are perfect. Hazel Grace & Augustus Waters are life okay. John Greene will remain the best author, in my opinion. Just so psyched to see this movie :D!!!!
