 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          The son of comparative literature professor August Coppola (a brother of director Francis Ford Coppola) and dancer/choreographer Joy Vogelsang, Cage changed his name early in his career to make his own reputation, succeeding brilliantly with a host of classic, quirky roles by the late 1980s.Initially studying theatre at Beverly Hills High (though he dropped out at 17), he secured a bit part in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) -- most of which was cut, dashing his hopes and leading to a job selling popcorn at the Fairfax Theater, thinking that would be the only route to a movie career. But a job reading lines with auditionees for uncle Francis' Rumble Fish (1983) landed him a role in that film, followed by the punk-rocker in Valley Girl (1983), which was released first and truly launched his career.His one-time passion for method acting reached a personal limit when he smashed a street-vendor's remote-control car to achieve the sense of rage needed for his gangster character in The Cotton Club (1984).In his early 20s, he dated Jenny Wright for two years and later linked to Uma Thurman. After a relationship of several years with Christina Fulton, a model, they split amicably and share custody of a son, Weston Cage (b.1992).
        Often plays flamboyant and/or eccentric characters (Ronny Cammareri in Moonstruck (1987), Sailor Ripley in Wild at Heart (1990), Ben Sanderson in Leaving Las Vegas (1995), Charlie Kaufman / Donald Kaufman in Adaptation. (2002)).
      His father was of Italian descent. His maternal grandfather was of approximately three quarters German and one quarter British Isles (English, Scottish) ancestry. His maternal grandmother was of Polish descent.
      Proposed to Patricia Arquette on the day he met her in the early 1980s. Arquette thought he was a bit strange but played along with his antics by creating a list of things Cage would have to fulfill to win her. When he started to work his way through the list, Arquette got scared and avoided him. They met again many years later and later went on to marry.
      1997: He lived in a fake castle on the outskirts Los Angeles. He wants to import an authentic one from overseas.
      The Wild at Heart (1990) movie poster lists his name as both "Nicolas Cage" and "Nicholas Cage".
      1984: Listed as one of 12 "Promising New Actors of 1984" in John Willis' Screen World, Vol. 36.
      2001: Announced that he is dating Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of the late Elvis Presley. They later married.
      Cousin of Robert Schwartzman, who changed his name to Robert Schwartzman-Cage inspired by Nicolas.
      May 2001: Awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts by California State University, Fullerton and also spoke at the commencement.
      Father, August Coppola, was formerly a professor at Cal State Long Beach and Dean of Creative Arts at San Francisco State University.
      During an A&E Biography on him, the host explained that Cage was director Sam Raimi's first choice to play Norman Osborn/Green Goblin in the movie Spider-Man (2002). Apparently this was before he met Willem Dafoe.
      On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992), he told Jay that he took the name "Cage" from a comic book character named Luke Cage, the "first black superhero." This is not accurate; the first black superhero in mainstream comics was Marvel's Black Panther, introduced in 1966. Luke Cage, introduced in 1972, was also preceded by: Marvel's Falcon, introduced in 1969; the black western hero, Lobo, from Dell Comics in 1965 (the first black character to star in his own title); the title character of "Waku, Prince of the Bantu," an African chieftain, introduced as part of the Atlas Comics anthology title "Jungle Tales" in 1954. When asked which of the powers he would prefer to have, he said flight was his desire.
      One of three actors (with Lee Marvin [Cat Ballou (1965)] and Peter Sellers [Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)]) with an Oscar nomination for playing multiple characters in a film (in Adaptation. (2002), he plays two characters, Donald and Charlie). Marvin is the only one who actually won one for a double role.
      Met his future wife, Alice Kim Cage, at a sushi bar where she was a waitress. When they married she was only 20 years old.
      Went to the same high school as Angelina Jolie, Michael Klesic, Lenny Kravitz, David Schwimmer, Jonathan Silverman, Gina Gershon, Rhonda Fleming, Jackie Cooper, Rob Reiner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Pauly Shore, Michael Tolkin, Betty White, Corbin Bernsen, Elizabeth Daily, Albert Brooks and Crispin Glover.
      Ate a real cockroach in the film Vampire's Kiss (1988), it reportedly took three takes. He once said about the experience, "Every muscle in my body didn't want to do it, but I did it anyway."
      His is (along with his cousin Sofia Coppola) the third generation of Oscar winners in the Coppola family. His uncle, Francis Ford Coppola and his grandfather, Carmine Coppola, are the other two generations. They are the second family to do so, the first family is the Hustons - Anjelica Huston, John Huston and Walter Huston.
      Became a father for the 2nd time at age 41 when his 3rd wife Alice Kim Cage gave birth to their son Kal-el Coppola Cage on October 3, 2005. Just as Nick was named after a comic book character, "Luke Cage", so he has named his son after the comic book character "Kal-el" (aka Superman).
      After his first film role (in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)), he adopted the stage name of Cage, because he wanted to assure himself that any success he had was based on his own merits, not the fame of his uncle, Francis Ford Coppola.
      2006: He purchased a home on the former property of John Wayne in Newport Beach, CA, for a record-setting $24 million.
      Said in a Reader's Digest interview that his wife, Alice, is into designing jewelry and has no interest whatsoever in being an actress.
      Was originally considered for the role of Brad Hamilton in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), but after his audition the studio thought his performance was too dark and the role went, instead, to Judge Reinhold. Additionally, Cage was 17 at the time and could not work as many hours as actors over 18. In this film, he is credited under the name Nicolas Coppola for the first and only time.
      1999: Was among the guests at the wedding of Spike Jonze and Sofia Coppola. Others were George Lucas, Jason Schwartzman, Bo Barrett, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Waits.
      Auditioned for the role of Joel in Risky Business (1983), which eventually went to Tom Cruise and helped launch his career.
      He said he realized that all great movie stars, such as Spencer Tracy, had had recognizable voices, so he has stylized his to be distinctive.
      Devoted Elvis Presley fan that he is, in Wild at Heart (1990) he performed the Elvis classic "Love Me" with uncanny aplomb.
      2007: Bought Midford Castle (though not an actual castle) near Bath, England for an estimated price £5 million (about $10 million).
      Owns homes in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, New Orleans, New York City and in one in Middletown, Rhode Island, which he purchased in 2007.
      Owns the rights of the original The Courtship of Eddie's Father (1963) movie, which he bought from Ted Turner, with the intention of turning it into a movie.
      While making an appearance on Late Show with David Letterman (1993) for the film Knowing (2009), he mentioned that he is fascinated with hang-gliding.
      Is an alumnus of the children's theatre group MET2 along with Adam Lambert, Sofia Coppola, Matt McFarland, Kylie Tyndall, Keaton Tyndall, Vivian Bayubay, Nathan Norton, Derek Klena, Lauren Klena, & Roma Watkins.
      The historic LaLurie House on the corner of Royal and Gov. Nicholls St. in New Orleans, which Cage bought for $3,450,000 in 2007, is reputed to be haunted by the many slaves tortured and killed by Delphine LaLurie in the 1830s.
      When Cage was arrested in New Orleans and charged with alleged domestic violence against his wife, Alice, and disturbing the peace. The $11,000 needed to bail him out was posted by Duane 'Dog' Chapman, better known as "Dog the Bounty Hunter". [April 2011]
      Ex-girlfriend Christina Fulton hit Cage with a $13 million lawsuit in 2009, regarding a property transfer. They negotiated a settlement in June 2011.
      Despite playing her father in Peggy Sue Got Married (1986), Cage is 1 year younger than Helen Hunt.
      He named his five favorite films as East of Eden (1955), A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), A Clockwork Orange (1971) and The Wizard of Oz (1939).
      Was originally cast as "Randy 'The Ram' Robinson" in The Wrestler (2008). However, Nic felt he didn't have time to bulk up for the part and Darren Aronofsky's heart was set on Mickey Rourke. Mickey would go on to win a Golden Globe and be nominated for an Oscar for his performance.
      Stated that the reason he owned so many pieces of property in the past--including multiple castles, mansions, and an island--was to protect his money without buying stock or relying on a bank, believing that real estate was the most trustworthy way to accomplish this. However, after the real estate bubble collapsed, he sold most of his property at a loss and rescinded on his belief. He now owns a modest amount of property: a house in Las Vegas near his friends and a small cottage near Glastonbury, England.
      Became a father for the 1st time at age 26 when his girlfriend Christina Fulton gave birth to their son Weston Cage on December 26, 1990.
      Bought the sprawling Gray Craig estate in Middletown for $15.7 million, a purchase price that ranks among the highest ever for a home in Rhode Island. [August 2007]
      To be a good actor you have to be something like a criminal, to be willing to break the rules to strive for something new.
      I am not a demon. I am a lizard, a shark, a heat-seeking panther. I want to be Bob Denver on acid playing the accordion.
      [about his marriage to Lisa Marie Presley] I'm sad about this, but we shouldn't have been married in the first place.
      Hollywood didn't know if I was an actor or a nut or if I was this crazy character I was playing. I had developed an image of being a little bit unusual, different and wild.
      I'm at the point now where I know I'm doing something right when a movie gets mixed reviews, because then I'm not in the box. I don't want to make it too easy for people and I don't want to make it too easy for myself. I want to try something unusual. I feel good about the bad reviews because I feel like I've affected them on some level. They may not know what I was trying to do but they felt something.
      I want to make all kinds of movies. I do want to make big movies that are a lot of fun to go to, but I also want to make movies that are going to stimulate some thought and maybe raise some awareness. And so please don't think you're gonna go on a roller-coaster ride with those movies.
      It's very risky for an actor who's a bankable star to make pictures like The Weather Man (2005) or Lord of War (2005) because they inevitably promote them like big studio releases. And they're not big studio movies, they're more edgy, thought-provoking, independent-spirited films. What happens is, it goes into the computer, and everyone says they can't open the movie because they thought it was X when it actually was Y.
      I needed to change my name just to liberate myself and find out I could do it without walking into a Hollywood casting office with the name Coppola.
      [Pablo Picasso] said art is a lie that tells the truth. What if you just want to tell the truth and not lie about it?
      It's good to make movies that are tragedies, where people can think about things in life that are undeniable, that everyone has to deal with. But at the same time, it's also healing to make movies that are entertaining, that are a lot of fun, where you don't have to think about your problems.
      When I did Vampire's Kiss (1988), I got so wound up. It was so important to me that this vision I had of Peter Lowe's character get on film exactly the way that I wanted it, that I frankly don't think I was very easy for anyone to live with. Certainly, I was not easy for myself to live with. I remember that I wasn't drinking or anything at the time. One night I felt so wound up that I was about to snap. I ordered a martini. And I just relaxed, and I could tell my body really needed a rest. From then on, I learned you can do good work without torturing yourself.
      What happens is, you become different people in your path as an actor. When I was doing those things, I was a very new actor. I didn't have a lot of training, and I was trying to make some sort of impact, because that was what was important for me at the time - to get on the map. There were things I would do that were more shocking, or approaches I would do to try and live the character, because I didn't have the training. But then, as I went on, I started to find other methods, ways to get into characters that weren't exactly destroying my life. (On the wild eccentrics he used to get into character earlier in his career)
      I remember when I met Johnny Depp, he was a guitar player from Florida, and he had no idea he could be an actor. I said, "I really think you are an actor, that you have that ability." That was just from playing one game of Monopoly with him. I sent him to my agent and he has gone on to carve out a successful career.
      There is a method of thought that says it's better to stay mysterious, make yourself an event so when you come out, people have a hunger to see you again. I can think of some superstars who adopt that principle, where they are very selective. But we are all going to get older, and there is something to be said about doing some of your best work when you are younger, when you still have that virility, something visceral and raw. I've heard there have been some actors who've regretted not doing more work when they were under fifty. (On why he works so much)
      [on making his character in Knowing (2009) a single father] I have seen a lot of movies with single mothers and their children. They're good, but there are not so many with capable single fathers. There seems to be this archetype that if you're a man and single, you're incapable of raising a child, which I think needs to be broken. If you find yourself in that position - like I have - it's important not to give up because of what people tell you.
      I was being stalked by a mime - silent but maybe deadly. Somehow, this mime would appear on the set of set of Bringing Out the Dead (1999) and start doing strange things. I have no idea how it got past security. Finally, the producers took some action and I haven't seen the mime since. But it was definitely unsettling.
      (The hardest part was) trying to figure out how I was going to entertain you while playing a guy who was completely out of his mind on crack. At the same time, trying to be responsible so it didn't become an advertisement for doing drugs. The other thing is, I wasn't sure I could play the part totally sober, which I was. In "Leaving Las Vegas," I had a few drinks between scenes to get to a certain feeling, to get to a certain truth. But with this I was trying to look at it more impressionistically from a landscape of maybe 25 years ago to see what would come out of that filter of my imagination. -- on the toughest aspect of preparing for "Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call -- New Orleans"
      So many directors are so arrogant. For example, Klaus Kinsky -- who Werner Herzog has a legacy with -- he was very frustrated with the arrogance. We always hear Werner's side of the story about "Klaus was this and Klaus was that" but you never get to here Klaus' side of the story. I was doing a scene (on "Bad Lieutenant") -- it was in my second day of shooting -- and we all know the imagination and preparation (required) to think I was on cocaine (for the character). There was a little bottle of baby powder, and I'm snorting that. I'm psyching up, I'm psyching up, and he comes up and says (in German accent), "Now Nicolas, what is in that vial?" And I was like, "Are you kidding me? After four hours of this you're gonna actually ask me that? Take me out of my preparation? You would think the director would understand the actor's process and give us the space and the room to do what it is we need to do.
      I don't want to minimize the effort that goes into having a career, but now with the video age, let's face it, you can write your own stories and you can make your own movies and get it out. Or go on stage somewhere in a small venue off-off-off-Broadway.
      Usually it's very cathartic. The hard stuff is when you're not feeling great and you have to do a really happy scene. -- on the personal toll acting can take on a person.
      James Dean in "East of Eden," the scene where he's trying to give Raymond Massey the money on his father's birthday. I was 14, I was at the New Beverly Cinema, and I said, "Oh, no, that is exactly how I feel. Oh my God, I have to do this. Nothing else ever affected me as strongly. -- on if there were any moments in his life when he realized he was going to be an actor.
      {on the recession] People are losing their jobs because of what's going on in the economy, but I want to make movies that give families something to look forward to.
      (1996 quote) Jim Carrey and I went to George Hamilton's wine bar. He's an interesting one. He was there and had some fun stories. I told him how he was one of my heroes from the time he played Evel Knievel. We had cigars, and very expensive bottles of wine were opened, and Jim and I were going, "This is great, man." At the end of the night we got slapped with an $8,000 bill. It was at that point that George became the fox in the Pinocchio story. He happens to look quite a bit like that fox. I would not want to play cards with George Hamilton.
      (1996) I remember my prom was a complete disaster. I used bonds my grandmother had given me to rent a tuxedo and a limousine so I could go to the prom with this beautiful girl. And at the end of the night I went to kiss her and she responded. I was so nervous that my stomach got really nauseous and I said, "Excuse me" and just threw up on the street all over my shoes and my rented tux. The limo driver wouldn't let me in the car. He split and I had to walk home. That was my prom night.
      (1996, on if he wants to do theater work) No, I have stage fright. I don't like it. I've never gotten over it.
      (1996) I do not have a religion in my life, I wasn't raised that way. My father always believed that if I was going to have a religion I should discover it on my own and not have it crammed down my throat at a young age. I kind of wish I had some religion.
      (1996) If I thought about awards, I would not have been able to do a movie like Leaving Las Vegas, because the word around town was that Mike [Figgis] and I were making the most unreleasable movie in Hollywood. I had some fear that the movie would not get released.
      (1996, on his life) I know what I want to do, I'm doing it, but I'm still very much a student of the craft and I think I can go further. I still torment myself. I have a lot of self-doubt.
      (1998 quote) I was once surrounded by rattlesnakes in a rattlesnake patch with my cousin Roman when we were 16 or 17. We were fishing in Napa Valley and walked right into it. There was a huge one coiled in front of us. A bigger one, to the left, was uncoiled, so I knew he wasn't a problem. We had to go over the coiled one, so we felt trapped and paralyzed with fear. There was nowhere to run, we were surrounded. I saw this pole with a nail through it, and I knew that I had to do something, so I grabbed the pole and pounded the snake. Then it came up and started rattling and was about to strike. I killed it, but felt bad about it. I felt anything you kill you've got to eat, so I took it home, cut the poison glands out, took the rattles off and cooked it.
      (1998, on the scariest thing that has happened to him) Years ago I was driving a car I'd bought, an Austin Healey with a V-8 engine, sort of a makeshift Cobra. I had taken it to a mechanic to put an automatic shifter in it. The mechanic did a really sloppy job. If you barely knocked the shifter it would go into separate gears. I was driving on the Hollywood Freeway and I accidentally bumped it into park. I was doing 80 mph at 10 p.m. and I started doing 360s. I wound up facing traffic, and then a Mack truck was coming at me. I thought, 'This is it, I'm dead'. The truck driver had a CB radio and said, "Put the car in reverse." I did and drove backwards until I got off at the exit, backwards!
      (1998 quote) What I like so much about Warhol-and he's actually influenced my acting, especially with Wild at Heart-is that he takes these icons and makes them his own, which is a brave thing to do. With acting it's not something you're supposed to do-you're never supposed to mimic or copy another person. For Wild at Heart I thought, 'Let's be Elvis'. I've always called that my Warhol performance, because I tried to subvert the image.
      (1998, Movieline Magazine) I did not want to be in Peggy Sue Got Married. I turned it down three times. Francis said, "I really need you to be in the movie." I read the script, which was a perfectly romantic film, but the character he wanted me to play was boring. He was the babe to Kathleen Turner's starring role. Just like women don't want to play the babe in movies, I didn't want to be Kathleen Turner's babe. I just wanted to play a character. So I thought, How can I make this guy really far out? I asked Francis about it on the phone and he said, Absolutely. I said, "I want to go really far out." He asked, "How far do you want to go?" I said, "I want to talk like Pokey" Because to me it was funny. And also, it was the way a lot of guys in high school sounded before their voices changed-they always had this high-sounding voice that would crack. When I see the movie now I'm really happy that I did that. I really am.
      (1998, Movieline Magazine) I see Miles Davis as a surrealist father of mine. He was the first person to believe in me as an actor, the one who first said he understood what I was talking about. It was on "The Dick Cavett Show." Before we went on he said to me, "Why aren't you wearing your leather jacket? Didn't you learn anything from Dennis Hopper?" Because I was wearing a suit. Then I went out and started talking about how if Picasso could paint surreal, why couldn't actors try to achieve that as well? Then Miles came on, and he was very considerate and he said, "I hear what you're saying." He kept looking at me like we had our own connection. Ever since then he stayed in my thoughts. He said the words I needed to hear to keep going with my choices. It's weird because my surrealist name, Cage, is actually taken from a black character, Luke Cage.
      The first time that I played Ghost Rider (2007). Blaze was easy; I knew he was a man who had been living with a curse for 8 years of having his head light on fire, and the tone that would take. I compared him to a cop, or a paramedic who develops a dark sense of humour to cope with the horrors he has seen. But Blaze has also caused the horrors, so he's hiding out because he doesn't want to hurt anyone else. Ghost Rider was an entirely new experience, and he got me thinking.
      I think that Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2011) was mentally taxing, if only because I had to go to a Christmas party shortly after I had wrapped photography in Romania at 2 in the morning as the Ghost Rider. The invitation had a Christmas ornament on it with Ghost Rider's face on it as a tree. I had a couple of schnapps and went to the party; I had not entirely let go of whatever magic I had been channelling, and all hell broke lose. In fact, I think I kept saying over and over: "Merry Christmas, you assholes!" I am lucky I'm not in a Romanian prison.
      I would like to see a sequel to Lord of War (2005). I think it would work really well, especially in this day and age where guns are at the center of political discussion. And also the boy in the movie, my son, there's this idea that he grows up and he goes into the trade and then I'm trying to get him out of it. I think that could be a very interesting movie.
      I hate violence. I just hate it. I read the paper every day - the New York Times, The Guardian - and I feel it, you know? It gets inside. I'm amazed that people are capable of those kinds of things to children and women.
      There's very few things that make me laugh. Mike Myers as Austin Powers makes me laugh - that was genius - and Daffy Duck makes me laugh, but I like odd behavior. I don't like hip dialogue and one-liners and all that sort of cool, sophomoric comedy. It's just not for me.
      I'm one of those guys where the more coffee I drink, the more stunts I do, the more relaxed I get.
      [on having a stalker] That was horrible. I mean, that's as bad as it gets: 2am and there's a naked man standing in front of your bed watching you sleep. It's not funny, but somehow people find it amusing.
      Halloween is a great holiday for any actor if you think about it. It's all about dress-up and playing characters. So yeah, it's always had a special place for me.
      [on the most haunted place he's ever been to] There's a house I used to live in called The LaLaurie Mansion on Royal Street in New Orleans, and it's notorious as the most haunted house in the United States. I spent time in there alone in total darkness to get some inspiration to write the great American horror novel, but I didn't get far. I'm not gonna go into detail.
      Film acting is one of the only industries where you're criticized for working hard. In any other industry it's considered a quality and something to behold.
      I haven't isolated myself. I am not living on a yacht somewhere. I am not tucked away or behind a gate somewhere. I am not flying on a private plane. I am going to the airport, I am with people, some of the interactions are good, some of them are not so good, but it keeps me in touch with being, you know, part of society. And I think that's necessary to stay relevant to be able to tell stories about people, which is what actors do.
      Sometimes your very own family that you're close to can be toxic. They take your success or your potential as a personal insult on their failure, and they beat you up or they say you'll never make it.
      Now even the art of film criticism... now in the LA Times, the critic who reviewed "Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans," incorporated how many homes I bought or sold into the review. What the hell does Lindsay Lohan's personal life have to do with her performance in "The Canyons"? It should always be about the work itself. What difference does it make if Bill Clinton had an affair -- how does that affect his performance as President?
      I started acting because I wanted to be James Dean. I saw him in "Rebel Without a Cause," "East of Eden." Nothing affected me -- no rock song, no classical music -- the way Dean affected in "Eden." It blew my mind. I was like, "That's what I want to do." This was before everyone had a thing called a Smartphone, and before the advent of the "celebutard" -- just being famous for famous' sake. I'm not complaining, but it really sucks to be famous right now.
      I am in the process of reinventing myself. I am returning to my roots, which is independently spirited, dramatic characters. I had taken a year off to re-evaluate everything I had done, different kinds of performances I had done, the more operatic and more baroque stuff like Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2011), Drive Angry (2011) or Season of the Witch (2011). I wanted to find something where I could use my life experience, my memories and my emotions."
      I started acting because I wanted to be James Dean. I saw him in Rebel Without a Cause (1955), East of Eden (1955). Nothing affected me - no rock song, no classical music - the way Dean affected in Eden. It blew my mind. I was like, 'That's what I want to do.' This was before everyone had a thing called a Smartphone - just being famous for famous' sake. I'm not complaining, but it really sucks to be famous right now.
      I don't take criticism seriously and I don't take praise seriously, both would be a mistake. If you buy into the negative that is the Internet today, or the cynical critic, it's not unlike listening to an abusive father that's trying to cave you in and you can't function. If you buy into praise, to people who adore you, you might get lazy and say, 'Well, I'll just keep doing that.' You have to stay uncomfortable. I learned that from David Bowie. I said, 'How do you do it? How do you keep reinventing yourself?' He said, 'I just never got comfortable with anything I was doing.' I knew those were words of wisdom from a great artist and I took those words seriously.
      I'd love to make a movie with Jack Nicholson. I don't know why it hasn't happened yet! But I think the two of us together, would [laughs] ... I'm sure it would be something to talk about! I feel very comfortable with him and I think we would do something special together.
      [on being sought by Cher to join the cast of 'Moonstruck'] I don't really know why she wanted me in the movie. She kept fighting for me. She saw me in 'Peggy Sue Got Married' and said it was like watching a two-hour train wreck. It was pretty intimidating to be her leading man.
      [on developing performance style] I [wanted]to get more 'quietude' - what Hemingway would call the taut fishing line. I wanted to have that simplicity again.'Joe' gave me the opportunity to explore that.. I see myself as a student. I'll hopefully do more seasoned kinds of performance as I get older.
      [advice to aspiring screen actors] If you're doing something really extraordinary, chances are you'll be an original. That might scare some people in the casting office. They might not know what to do with that. What I would suggest is to put a frame on it. Tape your audition. Put your performance in a frame so they can see it, and then go into the office. But I would send the tape. If you are genuinely talented, you are to be doing things that are special. So put a frame on it.
      When I did 'Joe' it was an opportunity for me to get what I call 'naked' as a film presence. It was time to not put things on top of a performance, but take things off - where I could take my life experience of the last years and find a script where I didn't have to act. Where I could just be, and not think too much about it. What was a great compliment was when my wife saw it with me in Venice and said, 'That's you'.
      I try to pick ans choose my material based on what I can do to challenge myself and make myself uncomfortable. Always stay a student, never be a maestro.
=======================================================
Nicolas Kim Coppola (born January 7, 1964),[1][2][3][4] known professionally as Nicolas Cage, is an American actor, director, and producer. He has performed in leading roles in a variety of films, ranging from romantic comedies and dramas to science fiction and action films. Cage is known for his prolificacy, appearing in at least one film per year nearly every year since 1980, with the exception of 1985 and 1991.
In the early years of his career, Cage starred in films such as Valley Girl (1983), Racing with the Moon (1984), Birdy (1984), Peggy Sue Got Married (1986), Raising Arizona (1987), Moonstruck (1987), Vampire's Kiss (1989), Wild at Heart (1990), Honeymoon in Vegas (1992), and Red Rock West (1993).
Cage received an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance as an alcoholic Hollywood writer in Leaving Las Vegas (1995) before coming to the attention of wider audiences with mainstream films such as The Rock (1996), Face/Off (1997), Con Air (1997), City of Angels (1998), and National Treasure (2004). He earned his second Academy Award nomination for his performance as Charlie and Donald Kaufman in Adaptation (2002). In 2002, he directed the film Sonny, for which he was nominated for Grand Special Prize at Deauville Film Festival. Cage owns the production company Saturn Films and has produced films such as Shadow of the Vampire (2000) and The Life of David Gale (2003).
Though his performances in The Weather Man (2005), Lord of War (2005), The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans (2009), and Kick-Ass (2010) earned critical acclaim, and films such as Ghost Rider (2007) and Knowing (2009) were box office successes, Cage has been strongly criticized in recent years for his choice of roles, some of which have been universally panned.[5][6] He starred in The Croods, The Frozen Ground, and Joe, which all received acclaim.
Cage was born in Long Beach, California, to parents August Floyd Coppola, a professor of literature, and Joy (Vogelsang), a dancer and choreographer. He was raised in a Catholic family.[7][8] His father was of Italian descent and his mother is of German and Polish descent.[9] His paternal grandparents were composer Carmine Coppola and actress Italia Pennino, and his paternal great-grandparents were immigrants from Bernalda, Basilicata, Italy.[10]
Through his father, Cage is the nephew of director Francis Ford Coppola and of actress Talia Shire, and the cousin of directors Roman Coppola and Sofia Coppola, film producer Gian-Carlo Coppola, and actors Robert Carmine and Jason Schwartzman. Cage's two brothers are New York radio personality Marc "The Cope" Coppola and director Christopher Coppola. He attended Beverly Hills High School, which is known for its many alumni who became entertainers. He aspired to act from an early age and also attended UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. His first non-cinematic acting experience was in a school production of Golden Boy. He cites James Dean as the key inspiration for his career, saying: "I started acting because I wanted to be James Dean. I saw him in Rebel Without a Cause, East of Eden. Nothing affected me - no rock song, no classical music - the way Dean affected me in Eden. It blew my mind. I was like, 'That's what I want to do'."[11]
To avoid the appearance of nepotism as the nephew of Francis Ford Coppola, he changed his name early in his career to Nicolas Cage, inspired in part by the Marvel Comics superhero Luke Cage. Since his minor role in the film Fast Times at Ridgemont High, with Sean Penn, Cage has appeared in a wide range of films, both mainstream and offbeat. He tried out for the role of Dallas Winston in his uncle's film The Outsiders, based on S.E. Hinton's novel, but lost to Matt Dillon. He was also in Coppola's films Rumble Fish and Peggy Sue Got Married.
Other Cage roles included appearances in the acclaimed 1987 romantic-comedy film Moonstruck, also starring Cher; The Coen Brothers cult-classic comedy Raising Arizona; David Lynch's 1990 film Wild at Heart; a lead role in Martin Scorsese's 1999 New York City paramedic drama Bringing Out the Dead; and Ridley Scott's 2003 drama film Matchstick Men, in which he played an agoraphobic, mysophobic, obsessive-compulsive con artist with a tic disorder.
Cage has been nominated twice for an Academy Award, winning once for his performance as a suicidal alcoholic in Leaving Las Vegas. His other nomination was for his portrayal of real-life screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and Kaufman's fictional twin Donald in Adaptation. Despite these successes, most of his lower-profile films have performed poorly at the box office compared to his mainstream action/adventure roles. The suspense thriller 8mm (1999) is considered a cult film. He took the lead role in the 2001 film Captain Corelli's Mandolin and learned to play the mandolin from scratch for the part. He made his directorial debut with 2002's Sonny. In 2005, two films he headlined, Lord of War and The Weather Man, failed to find a significant audience despite nationwide releases and good reviews for his acting in those roles. Poor reviews for The Wicker Man resulted in low box office sales. The much criticized Ghost Rider (2007), based on the Marvel Comics character, fared better, earning more than $45 million (the top earner) during its opening weekend and over $208 million worldwide through the weekend ending on March 25, 2007. Also in 2007, he starred in Next, which shared the concept of a glimpse into an alternate timeline with Cage's film, The Family Man (2000).
Most of Cage's movies that have achieved financial success were in the action/adventure genre. In his second-highest grossing film to date, National Treasure, he plays an eccentric historian who goes on a dangerous adventure to find treasure hidden by the Founding Fathers of the United States. Other action hits include The Rock, in which Cage plays a young FBI chemical weapons expert who infiltrates Alcatraz Island in hopes of neutralizing a terrorist threat, Face/Off, a John Woo film where he plays both a hero and a villain, and World Trade Center, director Oliver Stone's film regarding the September 11, 2001 attacks. He had a small but notable role as the Chinese criminal mastermind Dr. Fu Manchu in Rob Zombie's fake trailer Werewolf Women of the S.S. from the B-movie double feature Grindhouse.
Cage made his directorial debut with Sonny, a low-budget drama starring James Franco as a male prostitute whose mother (Brenda Blethyn) serves as his pimp. Cage had a small role in the film, which received poor reviews and a short run in a limited number of theatres. Cage's producing career includes Shadow of the Vampire, the first effort from Saturn Films.
In early December 2006, Cage announced at the Bahamas International Film Festival that he planned to curtail his future acting endeavors to pursue other interests. On The Dresden Files for the Sci-Fi Channel, Cage is listed as the executive producer.
In November 2007, Cage was spotted backstage at a Ring of Honor wrestling show in New York City researching his role for The Wrestler. The role was ultimately played by Mickey Rourke, who received an Academy Award nomination for his performance.[12] Wrestler Director Darren Aronofsky, in an interview with slashfilm.com, said of Cage's decision to leave the film that: "Nic was a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but ... you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he pulled himself out of the race.[13] "
In 2008, Cage appeared as Joe, a contract killer who undergoes a change of heart while on a work outing in Bangkok, in the film Bangkok Dangerous. The film is shot by the Pang Brothers and has a distinct South-East Asian flavor. In 2009, Cage starred in science fiction thriller Knowing, directed by Alex Proyas. In the film, he plays an MIT professor who examines the contents of a time capsule unearthed at his son's elementary school. Startling predictions found inside the capsule that have already come true lead him to believe the world is going to end at the close of the week, and that he and his son are somehow involved in the destruction. The film received mainly negative reviews but was the box office winner on its opening weekend. Also in 2009, Cage starred in the film The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, directed by acclaimed German director Werner Herzog. He portrayed a corrupt police officer with gambling, drug and alcohol addictions. The film was very well received by critics, holding a rating of 87% positive reviews on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.[14] Cage received lauds for his performance, with Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune writing "Herzog has found his ideal interpreter, a performer whose truth lies deep in the artifice of performance: ladies and gentlemen, Nicolas Cage, at his finest."[15] This film reunited Cage with Eva Mendes, who played his love interest in Ghost Rider. In 2010, Cage starred in the period piece Season of the Witch, playing a 14th-century knight transporting a girl accused of causing the Black Plague to a monastery, and The Sorcerer's Apprentice, in which he played the sorcerer.[16]
In 2012, Cage reprised his role in Ghost Rider's sequel Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. He voiced the character Grug Crood in the animated film The Croods, which was released in 2013. The Croods received positive reviews from critics and was a box office success grossing $585 million against a budget of $135 million.[17]
Cage, an avid comic book fan, auctioned a collection of 400 vintage comics through Heritage Auctions for over $1.6 million in 2002.[18]
In 2007, he created a comic book with his son Weston, called Voodoo Child, which was published by Virgin Comics.
Cage is a fan and collector of painter and underground comic artist Robert Williams. He has written introductions for Juxtapoz magazine and purchased the painting Death On The Boards.[19]
In February 2011, Cage said that, at a certain point in his career, he realized that he had developed his own method of acting, which he described as "Nouveau Shamanic." He noted, "at some point I'll have to write a book" about it.[20]
Cage's acting has been praised by influential film critic Roger Ebert, who wrote in his "Great Movies" essay, about the film Adaptation, that: "There are often lists of the great living male movie stars: De Niro, Nicholson and Pacino, usually. How often do you see the name of Nicolas Cage? He should always be up there. He's daring and fearless in his choice of roles, and unafraid to crawl out on a limb, saw it off and remain suspended in air. No one else can project inner trembling so effectively... he always seems so earnest. However, improbable his character, he never winks at the audience. He is committed to the character with every atom and plays him as if he were him."[21] In response to mixed reviews of Knowing and their focus on criticizing Cage, Ebert defended both Cage as an actor and the movie to which, in contrast to other critics, Ebert gave four out of four stars.[22]
Lord of War co-star Ethan Hawke said of Cage: "He's the only actor since Marlon Brando that's actually done anything new with the art of acting; he's successfully taken us away from an obsession with naturalism into a kind of presentation style of acting that I imagine was popular with the old troubadours." While stating that Cage had hurt his career by working on too many poor projects ("He's put a little too much water in his beer"), Hawke added: "If I could erase his bottom half bad movies, and only keep his top half movies, he would blow everyone else out of the water."[23]
In the 1996 Academy Awards, Cage was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in Leaving Las Vegas.[24] After receiving the award, Cage went on to star in some high budget action movies which received criticism by actors such Stephen Baldwin, Nick Nolte and Sean Penn, who, referring to his latest movie choices, including Snake Eyes, said to the New York Times that Cage is "no longer an actor. Now he's more like a performer."[25] However, in his Oscar acceptance speech for Mystic River, Penn referring to Cage's performance in critically acclaimed Matchstick Men mentioned it among the best performances of the year.[26]
In May 2001, Cage was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts by California State University, Fullerton. He spoke at the commencement ceremony.[27]
In 1988, Cage began dating actress Christina Fulton, who later bore their son, Weston Coppola Cage (born December 26, 1990). Weston was the lead singer of the black metal band Eyes of Noctum, but broke up in 2012; Arsh Anubis, his new band of the same genre, was formed in 2011. Weston also appeared in Cage's film Lord of War as Vladimir, a young Ukrainian mechanic who quickly disarms a Mil Mi-24 helicopter.
Cage has been married three times. His first wife was actress Patricia Arquette (married on April 8, 1995, divorce finalized on May 18, 2001).
Cage's second marriage was to singer/songwriter Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis Presley. Cage is an Elvis fan and used the star as the base of his performance in Wild at Heart. Presley and Cage married on August 10, 2002 and filed for divorce on November 25, 2002 which was finalized on May 16, 2004. The divorce proceeding was longer than the marriage.[28]
Cage met his third and current wife Alice Kim, a former waitress who previously worked at the Los Angeles restaurant Kabuki and at the Los Angeles-based Korean nightclub, Le Privé. She bore their son, Kal-El, (after Superman's birth name[29]) on October 3, 2005. Cage was once considered for the role of Superman in a film to be directed by Tim Burton. Alice had a minor role in the 2007 film Next, which Cage produced. They were married at a private ranch in Northern California on July 30, 2004.[30]
Cage grew up in a family of Catholic background but he does not talk about religion publicly and refuses to answer on religion-connected questions in his interviews.[31] When he asked about the movie Knowing being a religion-themed film or not, Cage replied: "Any of my personal beliefs or opinions runs the risk of impinging on your own relationship with the movie. I feel movies are best left enigmatic, left raising more questions than answers. I don't want to ever preach. So [whatever you get] from the movie [is] far more interesting than I could ever offer."[32]
During his visit to University of California, Santa Cruz he stated he is not a politically active actor and that he can do it in his work as he learned more about nuclear power from the movie The China Syndrome.[33] Cage has donated about $5,000 to the Democratic Party since 1994.[34]
He's considered as one of the most generous stars of Hollywood[35] as he donated $2 million to Amnesty International for to use to offer rehabilitation shelters, medical services and psychological and reintegration services to some of the 300,000 youngsters forced to fight in conflicts across the world.[36] He has also donated one million dollars to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.[37] He became the first artist to support ArtWorks, an artist engagement program to raise awareness of fundamental rights at work, including freedom from slavery and from child labor.[38] Cage has also honored with Humanitarian award from United Nations for his works and appointed as an UN ambassador for Global Justice.[39] He led a campaign around the film Lord of War to raise awareness about international Arms Control, supported "Heal the Bay", the United Negro College Fund efforts, and the Royal United Hospital's Forever Friends Appeal to build intensive care units for babies.[40]
Nicolas Cage is one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors, earning $40 million in 2009 according to Forbes Magazine.[41]
Cage had a Malibu home where he and Kim lived, but sold the property in 2005 for $10 million. In 2004 he bought a property on Paradise Island, Bahamas. In May 2006, he bought a 40-acre (160,000 m2) island in the Exuma archipelago, some 85 miles (137 km) southeast of Nassau and close to a similar island owned by Faith Hill and Tim McGraw.
He once owned the medieval castle of Schloss Neidstein in the Oberpfalz region in Germany, which he bought in 2006 and sold in 2009 for $2.5 million. His grandmother was German, living in Cochem an der Mosel.[42]
In August 2007, Cage purchased "Grey Craig", a 24,000-square-foot (2,200 m2) brick-and-stone country manor in Middletown, Rhode Island. With an estate occupying 26 acres (110,000 m2) the home has 12 bedrooms and 10 full bathrooms and overlooks the Atlantic Ocean. It borders the Norman Bird Sanctuary to the west. The sale ranked among the state of Rhode Island's most expensive residential purchases until eclipsed that same year, 2007, by the $17.15 million sale of the Miramar mansion on Bellevue Avenue in Newport.
Also in 2007, the actor purchased Midford Castle in Somerset, England.[43][44][45] Shortly after selling his German castle, Cage also put homes in Rhode Island, Louisiana, Nevada, and California, as well as a $7 million island in the Bahamas, up for sale.
On July 14, 2009, the Internal Revenue Service filed documents in New Orleans in connection with a federal tax lien against property owned by Cage in Louisiana, concerning unpaid federal taxes. The IRS alleges that Cage failed to pay over $6.2 million in federal income tax for the year 2007.[46] In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has another lien for more than $350,000 in unpaid taxes dating from 2002 to 2004.[47] Cage filed a $20 million lawsuit on October 16, 2009, against his business manager, Samuel J. Levin, alleging negligence and fraud.[48] The lawsuit states that Levin "had failed to pay taxes when they were due and had placed [Cage] in speculative and risky real estate investments 'resulting in (the actor) suffering catastrophic losses'."[48] Cage is also facing separate lawsuits from East West Bank[49] and Red Curb Investments for unpaid, multimillion dollar loans.
Samuel Levin filed a counter-complaint and responded to the lawsuit in a filing stating that he warned Cage that he was living beyond his means and urged him to spend less. Levin's filing states that "instead of listening to Levin, cross-defendant Cage (Coppola) spent most of his free time shopping for high ticket purchases, and wound up with 15 personal residences", Levin's complaint continued: "Likewise, Levin advised Coppola against buying a Gulfstream jet, against buying and owning a flotilla of yachts, against buying and owning a squadron of Rolls Royces, against buying millions of dollars in jewelry and art."[50]
In his filing Levin says that in 2007 Cage's "shopping spree entailed the purchase of three additional residences at a total cost of more than $33 million; the purchase of 22 automobiles (including 9 Rolls Royces); 12 purchases of expensive jewelry; and 47 purchases of artwork and exotic items."[50] One of those exotic items was a dinosaur skull of a Tarbosaurus for which Nicolas Cage paid $276,000 in an auction after winning a bidding contest against Leonardo DiCaprio.[51]
According to Cage, he owned the "Most Haunted House in America", a home located in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana.[52] The home is known as "The LaLaurie house" after its former owner Delphine LaLaurie. The house was foreclosed and sold at auction on November 12, 2009 along with another New Orleans property for a total of $5.5 million, in the wake of his financial problems.[53]
His Bel Air home, which had six loans totaling $18 million on it, failed to sell at an April 2010 foreclosure auction despite an opening offer of $10.4 million, substantially less than the $35 million that Cage had originally tried to sell it for. The home, built in 1940 for $110,000 had been owned by Dean Martin and singer Tom Jones.[54] The home eventually sold in November 2010 for $10.5 million.[55] Another home in Nevada also faces foreclosure auction.[53]
In November 2011, Cage also sold his Action Comics 1 in an online auction for a record-breaking $2.16 million (the previous record being 1.5), to assist paying his tax liens and other debts. Cage purchased the comic in 1997 for $110,000.[56]
In December 2009, Christina Fulton sued Cage for $13 million and the house she is living in. The suit was in response to an order that she leave the dwelling that was brought about by Cage's financial difficulties.[57]
On April 15, 2011, at 11:30 pm, Cage was arrested in New Orleans in the city's famed French Quarter district for suspicion of domestic abuse battery, disturbing the peace and public intoxication, after a police officer was flagged down by onlookers after Cage allegedly grabbed his wife's upper arm while appearing to be under the influence of alcohol.[58] Cage was held in police custody until a bail of $11,000 was posted by Duane "Dog" Chapman.[59] He was later ordered to appear in court on May 31, 2011.[60] On May 5, 2011, it was announced that the charges against Cage had been dropped.[61][62][63]

=======================================================
He won an Oscar for 'Leaving Las Vegas' and has starred in dramas, thrillers, action flicks and comedies. An all-rounder who continues to shine in Hollywood as an acting genius.
Nicholas Kim Coppola had some heavyweight career successes to live up to when it came to his family. Both his parents were well-respected achievers - his father August was a writer and professor in comparative literature (later to become Dean of Creative Arts at San Francisco State University) and his mother Joy was a renowned ballet dancer and choreographer.
Meanwhile, Cage’s uncle is none other than the acclaimed director (of films such as 'The Godfather' and 'Apocalypse Now'), Francis Ford Coppola.
Cage’s mother suffered from chronic depression and by 1976, his parents had divorced. He attended Beverly Hills High School during his youth - which famously educated many other A-list stars such as Angelina Jolie, David Schwimmer and Lenny Kravitz.
Studying theatre at school as encouraged by his father, Cage began to realise that experience, not education, was going to take him where he wanted to be so he chose to leave school early in order to concentrate on his acting pursuits full-time.
Initially being linked with his well-known uncle was beneficial as it landed him a part in Cameron Crowe’s debut film, 'Fast Times At Ridgemont High' in 1982 (starring with a herd of soon-to-be-stars including Forest Whitaker and Jennifer Jason Leigh). This was soon followed by a lead role in 'Valley Girl' (1983) but his luck began to run dry and after a succession of audition rejections, Coppola decided to wave goodbye to his famous name connections. Worried that many people would judge him prematurely on the basis of his family credentials, Nicolas Coppola became Nicholas Cage, a surname chosen in homage to one his comic book heroes, Luke Cage.
Despite detaching himself from the obvious Coppola line, Cage continued to stay on close terms with his uncle and take advice from him. Cage’s next project, 'Rumble Fish came about thanks to a minor helping hand from Francis Ford-Coppola and he impressed enough to gain a part in 'Racing with the Moon' with another actor climbing the steep ladder to fame - Sean Penn.
Choosing to carry on piggy-backing off his Uncle’s success, Cage was cast in Coppola’s 'The Cotton Club' in 1984. After appearing in 'Birdy' the same year, he once again returned to the safe helm of Uncle Francis in 'Peggy Sue Got Married'. This film marked the end of the Uncle-Nephew working relationship though. It has been said that Cage’s chosen acting methods had become extreme (suggested that he had inherited his mother’s odd and often erratic perspective on things). So desperate was he to disappear into a role, Cage often performed in such a bizarre manner that he was seen as too flamboyant for many. Coppola had realised this after Cage’s surreal techniques incurred the wrath of studio executives who disliked his method.
One person who had valued Cage’s performances was the singer Cher and she subsequently requested he be cast as her young lover in the 1987 film 'Moonstruck'. The film came as a long-awaited triumph to Cage as his performance was applauded and he earned himself a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actor, while Cher won an Academy Award for her role.
Meanwhile, Cage had begun dating actress Christina Fulton who later had his first child, Weston Coppola Cage in 1992. However, the couple’s relationship was not to last beyond this.Just before Cage made 'Moonstruck', he had taken a part in what was to become something of a cult hit, 'Raising Arizona'. After Moonstruck came 'Vampire’s Kiss' in which Cage famously ate a live cockroach in the name of acting, only to be asked to do a second take!
Having won an audience in the underground world with his turn in Raising Arizona, Cage played a part somewhat reflective of himself in 1990 as an Elvis-obsessive in 'Wild At Heart' (Cage is a huge Elvis fan). A stream of films continued to fill out Cage’s CV for the next couple of years from his attempts to break into the ‘mainstream’ with 'Wings Of The Apache', to his more natural habitat in lower budget flicks such as 'Deadfall', directed by his brother Christopher Coppola.
Mike Figgis’ 'Leaving Las Vegas' was to be a huge benchmark for Cage in 1995. Thanks to Cage’s penchant for going beyond the call of duty in terms of role preparation, his part as an alcoholic writer took him first to Ireland to experience hardcore drinking in the land of writers first hand. His performance was rated highly by the critics and Cage won both a Best Actor Academy Award and a Golden Globe.
1995 was not only a good year for Cage on the work front, he also married his actress girlfriend Patricia Arquette - forging links between two great acting families. Cage had initially met Arquette in the early 80s and apparently proposed but Arquette had teased him by issuing him with a list in which he’d have to fulfill for her to accept his proposal. When Cage took the joke list with the same serious nature he approached acting parts, he managed to scare Arquette off and she subsequently avoided him for a while. Their relationship was famously tempestuous though and by February 2000 Cage had filed for divorce, withdrawing the papers two months later but finalising again by 2001.
Following the worldwide success of Leaving Las Vegas, Cage was in the position to negotiate the big-bucks offers on his own terms. The blockbuster budget film 'The Rock' (1996) saw him star alongside Sean Connery, followed the hits 'Face/Off' (1997) with John Travolta and the slightly less impressive 'Con Air' (1997).
This hat-trick of action hits left room for Cage to indulge in a romantic comedy in Joel Schumacher’s 'City Of Angels' on 1997 followed by a turn in Martin Scorsese’s 'Bringing Out The Dead'. By the time 'Gone in 60 Seconds' was released in 2000, Cage could command a whopping $20 million fee.
Cage’s personal life was keeping the tabloids fed too. It had become well known after his part in Wild At Heart that Cage was a real-life Elvis fanatic, so the media kicked up a frenzy when he began dating Lisa-Marie Presley in 2001. After marrying in Hawaii in August 2002, no one could feign surprise that Cage had filed for divorce by November the same year. Reasons for the divorce attracted much speculation, including the obvious unique Elvis trophy - his daughter - and the fact that Cage wasn’t ready to let go of his bachelor life-style.
The millennium began with Cage filming the big-budget adaptation of Louis de Bernieres’ novel 'Captain Corelli’s Mandolin' in Greece. Next followed another World War II film, 'Windtalkers', which saw Cage reunited with John Woo.
As a progression from his acting, Cage chose to make his directorial debut with 'Sonny' (2002) starring English actress Brenda Blethyn and Mena Suvari. Cage had been championing the project for years and had considered playing the lead part at first but realised he was too old by the time filming began so instead cast James Franco. A tense plot, the film was recognised by the critics and was nominated for a Grand Special Prize at the Deauville American Independent Film Festival in France.
Not content with having director credits added to his portfolio, Cage produced his first film - 'Shadow of the Vampire' - in 2000 with Saturn Films, the company he had founded with Norm Golightly. The film was a great success and earned a trunk load of award nominations including a Best Supporting Academy Award nod for Willem Dafoe.
Back at the acting helm, 2002 brought 'Adaptation' to our screens which saw Cage take a break from his big-budget action films and return to the land of the surreal and odd. Working with the Coen Brothers again (Raising Arizona), he plays another dual role in the same vein as Face/Off but as Charlie Kauffman (its real-life screenwriter) and Charlie’s fictional brother Donald. The part earned Cage his second Oscar and third Golden Globe nomination.
After the minor success of Ridley Scott’s 'Matchstick Men' in 2003, the following year was to be more on par with the highs of Cage’s career. His divorce from Lisa Marie Presley finally came through and he married Alice Kim, a 20-year-old sushi bar waitress who he’d only met six months before. Their son, Kal-El was born in October 2005 and in true Cage fashion, was named after the birth name of Superman in the DC Comic series.
In his working life, he saw an international hit for the first time in a while with 'National Treasure' (2004) - on similar lines to the plot of 'The Da Vinci Code' and a topic of fascination in the media at the time. The film took $173 million at the US box office and Cage confirmed his status as a versatile A-lister.
In 2005 came 'Lord of War' and 'The Weather Man', both of which failed to make any great shakes in the critic’s world. Yet 2006 marked a continuance of Cage’s appeal with the animation 'Ant Bully' and the more controversial 'World Trade Centre'. Director Oliver Stone attempted to explore the human characters involved in the 11th September attacks. Despite fears that many people would worry about the release coming too soon after the events of 2001, Cage played his role with delicate realism.
'The Wicker Man' was a slight blip on the Cage radar, generally as most considered it a mistake to re-make a classic that was considered 'untouchable'.
It has been noted from Cage’s naming of his second son (Kal-El) that he is a huge comic book collector and fan. The 2007 project of 'Ghost Rider' finally saw Cage come to play a character adapted from one of his favourite comic books (he also has a Ghost Rider tattoo).
So deep is his passion for comics that he has created his own series called 'Voodoo Child', which is published by Virgin Comics. Cage had been approached by executives at Virgin but was gazumped when it came an original concept. "I said I didn't have any ideas, but I told them my son might," he said. Together with 16-year-old Weston, they brainstormed to create the six- issue illustrated series.
He may have dropped the Coppola name a long while ago but it’s clear that success is simply in his genes.
In 2009, Cage continued his trend of appearing in movies based on comics and starred in 'Astroboy', which was based on a Japanese manga-style comic.
And when the opportunity came to play the role of Big Daddy in the superhero/action movie 'Kick Ass', Cage jumped at the chance. His predilection for playing comic book heroes will see him return as the demonic motorcyclist from hell in 'Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance', which is set for release in early 2012.
Meanwhile, Cage recently said in an interview with the BBC that his latest role in the supernatural thriller 'Season of the Witch', in which he stars alongside Ron Perlman, had allowed him to realise another childhood dream.
He plays a 14th century knight sent on a quest to rid his homeland of the plague and the actor admitted that he had been imagining himself playing this role since he was just five years old.
Although Cage's dream of taking the role as a knight has finally come true, his attempt to become the king of property development continues to go unrealised.
In December 2010, he was forced to reduce the asking price for the mansion house he bought for more than $17million in 2007 when it failed to attract a buyer.

Cage's uncle is Francis Ford Coppola but he didn't want any favors in Hollywood so he changed his name from Coppola to Cage in honor of the musician John Cage. He has had a string of successes that range from comedy to romance to crime and thrillers. In 1996,
He is known for delving deeply into his roles and identifying with his characters, even to the extent of having a tooth removed without Novocaine for his 1989 role in Birdy. He also ate a live cockroach in Vampire's Kiss.
Cage was born in Los Angeles. His mother suffered bouts of depression and was hospitalized during his childhood. Nevertheless, he was close to her and later used his understanding of her mental illness to help create his film characters.  His parents divorced when
he was twelve. Cage left high school early to pursue acting studies at the American Conservatory Theater. He made his film debut in Valley Girl (1983) and began portraying a series of characters that were loopy, underhanded and borderline psychotic.
Cage played opposite Cher in the wildly popular Moonstruck, transforming himself from a brooding man who had been left at the altar to a romantic and cultured opera buff. Again, his performance was driven by real life, since he had recently suffered a break-up with actress Jenny Wright. 
In 2000, he tried his hand at something completely differentplaying the lead in a romantic comedy with The Family Man, and he won a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for his effort. In Adaptation (2002), he played the dual role of brothers Charlie and Donald Kaufman, and earned Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for his performances. Cage can be seen reprising his role as the devil's right-hand man in Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2012), the sequel to the 2007 hit, Ghost Rider. More recently, he starred in the drama  Joe (2014). 
Cage has been married three timeshis first wife was actress Patricia Arquette (1995 to 2001), but the marriage ended in divorce. A long time Elvis fan, he then married Lisa Marie Presley, but his second marriage lasted only a few months. He is currently married to Alice Kim, whom he met at a sushi bar where she worked as a waitress. She was 20 when they married. They have a son together, named Kal-el Coppola Cage. Cage also has a son, Weston Coppola-Cage, from a previous relationship.

Actor Nicolas Cage has always strived to make a name for himself based on his work, rather than on his lineage. As the nephew of filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, Cage altered his last name to avoid accusations of nepotism. (He chose "Cage" both out of admiration for avant-garde musician John Cage and en homage to comic book hero Luke Cage). Even if he had retained the family name, it isn't likely that anyone would consider Cage holding fast to his uncle's coattails. Time and again, Cage travels to great lengths to add verisimilitude to his roles. Born January 7, 1964, in Long Beach, CA, to a literature professor father and dancer/choreographer mother, Cage first caught the acting bug while a student at Beverly Hills High School. After graduation, he debuted on film with a small part in Amy Heckerling's 1982 classic Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Following a lead role in Martha Coolidge's cult comedy Valley Girl (1983), Cage spent the remainder of the decade playing endearingly bizarre and disreputable men, most notably as Crazy Charlie the Appliance King in Peggy Sue Got Married (1986), Hi McDonough in Raising Arizona (1987), and Ronny Cammareri in the same year's Moonstruck, the last of which won him a Golden Globe nomination and a legion of female fans, ecstatic over the actor's unconventional romantic appeal. The '90s saw Cage assume a series of diverse roles, ranging from a violent ex-con in David Lynch's Wild at Heart (1990) to a sweet-natured private eye in the romantic comedy Honeymoon in Vegas (1992) to a dying alcoholic in Mike Figgis' astonishing Leaving Las Vegas (1995). For this last role, Cage won a Best Actor Oscar for his quietly devastating portrayal, and, respectability in hand, gained an official entrance into Hollywood's higher ranks.  After winning his Oscar, along with a score of other honors for his performance, Cage switched gears in a way that would prove to be, with the occasional exception, largely permanent. He dove into a series of action movies like the Michael Bay thriller The Rock, the prisoners-on-a-plane movie Con Air, and the infamous John Woo flick Face/Off. Greeted with hefty paychecks and audience approval, Cage forged ahead on a career path lit largely with explosions. There would be exceptions, like 1998's City of Angels, a remake of Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, and Martin Scorsese's Bringing Out the Dead, and the the lightly dramatic romantic comedy The Family Man, but Cage stuck mostly to thrillers and action movies. A spate of such films would fill his resume, like Gone in 60 Seconds, The Life of David Gale, 8MM, and Snake Eyes, but Cage would briefly revisit his roots in character work, teaming with Being John Malkovich director Spike Jonze in 2002 for a duel role in the complex comedy Adaptation (2002). With Cage appearing as both screenwriter Charlie Kaufman as well as his fictional brother Donald, Adaptation followed Charlie's attempt to adapt author Susan Orlean's seemingly unfilmable novel The Orchid Thief as a feature film, and Donald's parallel efforts to write his own hacky yet lucrative script by following the guidance of a caustic, Syd Field-like screenwriting instructor (Brian Cox). A weighty role that demanded an actor capable of portraying characters that couldn't differ more emotionally despite their outward appearance, Adaptation brought Cage his second Oscar nomination -- and he was soon back to business as usual. 2004 saw the release of the megahit adventure film National Treasure, which cast Cage as an archaeologist convinced there's a treasure map on the back of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. The outrageous film would earn a sequel in 2007, but first Cage made the ill-advised decision to star in Neil LaBute's reworking of the Robin Hardy/Anthony Shaffer collaboration The Wicker Man (2006). Though video compilations of the movie's most hilariously hackneyed moments would become popular on the internet, Cage was soon portraying a motorcycle-driving stuntman who sells his soul to Mephistopheles -- in Mark Steven Johnson's live-action comic book adaptation Ghost Rider. Upon premiering in the States, the film became a big success. In the same year's sci-fi thriller Next, directed by Lee Tamahori, Cage plays Cris Johnson, a man who attains the ability to see into the future and must suddenly decide between saving himself and saving the world; the film failed to ignite the way Ghost Rider did just a couple months before it.  Next came Bangkok Dangerous, Knowing, The Bad Liutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans, Drive Angry, Seeking Justice, and Trespass -- all high octane, high adrenaline movies that found Cage diving, leaping, and shooting his way through the story. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi

Nicholas cage is truly a great artist, putting everything into ever part he plays. Sadly I think money and the amount of money made by many artist is their down full. I wonder how they would be if they were only paid the minimum wage. That would be interesting to see ?? !!
 I have always thought he was The Best and still do.  He only gets noticed for the "bad" stuff and not so with the good.  Very underrated he is.  Love your beautiful eyes Nicolas Cage.  You are a good natured interesting multi talented actor and your own person.  (I see only one bad comment for you for here), maybe things will be better for you and the incredibly stupid people who put you down will crawl back underground.
I met him once while the filming of "Racing With The Moon" was happening in Fort Bragg, CA. He said to me, "I really like Fort Bragg. What I like about it most is the...Jell-O. Yeah, you've really got the best Jell-O." What a tool. 
 "a 20-year-old woman miraculously landed two job offers after accidentally emailing a photo of the star to a potential employer instead of her résumé."BS. You know she did that on purpose. That's just business savvy. 
Happy Birthday Nicolas Cage! You're not getting older, you're getting better. Have a wonderful day! Brazilian Kisses :-)

'I look at that beach and I can tell you where each one was lying...   I can still see their faces': Tears of D-Day veterans as they make emotional return to Normandy to honour their fallen comrades
        Former soldiers from Britain and the US stood alongside other heroes as they recalled the harrowing day in 1944. Many were seen saluting at the gravestones of their friends while others wiped tears from their eyes as they listened to speeches made during the commemoration services. Harold Baumgarten, 89, described how he could look out at the beaches of northern France and point to where the bodies lay. The former US soldier was just 19 years old when he jumped off the landing craft and, 70 years on, has paid tribute to the 9,387 Americans who fell during the invasion, suggesting they are the reason he arrived safely back home.
