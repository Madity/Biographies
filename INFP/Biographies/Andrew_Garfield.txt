Andrew Russell Garfield[2] (born 20 August 1983) is an actor with dual citizenship of the United States and the United Kingdom. Born in Los Angeles and raised in Surrey, Garfield began his career on the United Kingdom stage and in television productions. He made his feature film debut in the 2007 ensemble drama Lions for Lambs. Garfield first came to international attention in 2010 with a supporting role in the drama film The Social Network, for which he received Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations. His performance as Spider-Man / Peter Parker in the superhero film The Amazing Spider-Man (2012), a reboot of the Spider-Man film series, was generally well received. Garfield reprised his role in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which was released in 2014.
Garfield was born in Los Angeles. His mother, Lynn (née Hillman),[1][3] is from Essex, England, and his father, Richard Garfield, is from California.[4][5] Garfield's paternal grandparents were also from the United Kingdom.[6] His parents moved the family from Los Angeles to Britain when he was three years old, and Garfield was raised in Epsom, Surrey,[4][7] in a middle class home.[8] Garfield has described himself as Jewish.[9] His paternal grandparents were from Jewish immigrant families who had moved to London from Eastern Europe (Poland, Russia, and Romania), and the family surname was originally "Garfinkel".[6][10]
Garfield's parents ran a small interior design business; his mother is a teaching assistant at a nursery school, and his father became head coach of the Guildford Swimming Club.[11][12] He has an older brother who is a doctor.[13] Garfield was a gymnast and a swimmer during his early years.[5][11] He had originally intended to study business, but became interested in acting at the age of sixteen.[14] Garfield attended Priory Preparatory School in Banstead and later City of London Freemen's School in nearby Ashtead, before training at the Central School of Speech and Drama, University of London, from which he graduated in 2004.[11][15]
Garfield began taking acting classes in Guildford, Surrey, when he was twelve, and appeared in a youth theatre production of Bugsy Malone.[13] He also joined a small youth theatre workshop group in Epsom, and began working primarily in stage acting. In 2004 he won a Manchester Evening News Theatre Award for Best Newcomer for his performance in Kes at Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre (where he also played Romeo the year after), and won the Outstanding Newcomer Award at the 2006 Evening Standard Theatre Awards.[8] Garfield made his British television debut in 2005 appearing in the Channel 4 teen drama Sugar Rush.[8] In 2007 he garnered public attention when he appeared in the third series of the BBC's Doctor Who, in the episodes "Daleks in Manhattan" and "Evolution of the Daleks". Garfield commented that it was "an honour" to be a part of Doctor Who.[16] In October 2007, he was named one of Variety's "10 Actors to Watch".[17] He made his American film debut in November 2007, playing an American university student in the ensemble drama Lions for Lambs, with co-stars Tom Cruise, Meryl Streep and Robert Redford.[17] "I'm just lucky to be there working on the same project as them, although I don't really expect to be recognized later by audiences," Garfield told Variety in 2007.[17] In his review for The Boston Globe, Wesley Morris considered the actor's work "a willing punching bag for the movie's jabs and low blows".[18]
In the Channel 4 drama Boy A, released in November 2007, he portrayed a notorious killer trying to find new life after prison.[19] The role garnered him the 2008 British Academy Television Award for Best Actor.[20] Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle wrote that "there is no doubt about the intelligence and sensitivity" of Garfield's portrayal.[19] Minneapolis Star Tribune's Christy DeSmith echoed Biancolli's sentiment, citing his "detailed expressions" as an example.[21] Writing in The Seattle Times, John Hartl noted that Garfield demonstrated range in the role, and concluded: "Garfield always manages to capture his passion".[22] Joe Morgenstern, the critic for The Wall Street Journal, dubbed Garfield's performance "phenomenal", assessing that he "makes room for the many and various pieces of Jack's personality".[23] In 2008, he had a minor role in the film The Other Boleyn Girl, and was named one of the shooting stars at the Berlin International Film Festival.[17] In 2009, Garfield held supporting roles in the Terry Gilliam film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus and the Red Riding television trilogy.[9][24] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times thought that Garfield gave a stand out performance in the latter.[24]
In 2010, Garfield co-starred opposite Carey Mulligan and Keira Knightley in Mark Romanek's dystopian science fiction drama Never Let Me Go, an adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's 2005 novel of the same name. He said of his character, Tommy D., "There's a sense of anxiety that runs through these kids, especially Tommy, because he's so sensory and feeling and animalistic, that's my perspective of him."[25] Garfield was attracted to the film based on the existential questions the story expresses.[25] He called the experience of being a part of Never Let Me Go a "dream to come true".[26] He further remarked that the scenes in which his character—unable to contain his frustration—erupts with a wail, were "intense" for him. "I think those screams are inside all of us, I just got a chance to let mine out".[27] For his portrayal of a well-meaning, but dim young man caught in a love triangle, he won the 2010 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor.[28] Cleveland Magazine's Clint O'Connor lauded his performance, commenting that Garfield delivered "a terrifically anguished performance" in the film.[29] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman praised the performances of the lead cast, reflecting that "these three all act with a spooky, haunted innocence that gets under your skin."[30] Tom Preston, a critic from The Guardian, further described Garfield's acting as solid and "at times deeply moving".[31] In comparison to Mulligan and Knightley, Scott Bowles, writing for USA Today, deemed Garfield "the real find" of Never Let Me Go.[32]
The same year, Garfield co-starred opposite Jesse Eisenberg in The Social Network, a drama based on the founders of Facebook. On his character, Garfield remarked that "No one knows who Eduardo Saverin is, and I don't either. Of course, the fact he's a real-life human being, breathing on this Earth somewhere, creates a whole new dimension to my approach because you feel a greater sense of responsibility".[33] Initially, the film's director, David Fincher, had met with Garfield under the auspices of him playing Mark Zuckerberg, having been referred to him by Mark Romanek.[33] However, Fincher did not like Garfield for the part as he found Garfield's "incredible emotional access to his kind of core humanity" better tailored for the role of Saverin.[33] Garfield's performance was very well received; he earned wider recognition and numerous nominations, including BAFTA nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and Rising Star, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance in a Supporting Role.[34][35] Mark Kermode of the BBC expressed his surprise that Garfield had been overlooked for an Academy Award nomination, opining that "everyone knows he's one of the very best things about the Social Network".[36] Writing in The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern thought the role was portrayed with "great subtlety and rueful charm".[37] Rolling Stone said Garfield delivered "a vulnerability that raises the emotional stakes in a movie", and proclaimed: "Keep your eyes on Garfield — he's shatteringly good, the soul of a film that might otherwise be without one."[38] He received similar plaudits of the Los Angeles Times, Entertainment Weekly, and The New Yorker.[39][40][41]
In 2010, Garfield was cast as Spider-Man / Peter Parker, opposite Emma Stone as his love interest Gwen Stacy, in Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man, a reboot of the Spider-Man film series.[42][43][44] Garfield saw his casting as a "massive challenge in many ways", having to make the character "authentic" and "live and breathe in a new way".[45] Garfield described Peter as someone he can relate to and stated that the character had been an important influence on him since he was a child.[46][47][48][49] For the role, Garfield studied the movements of athletes and spiders and tried to incorporate them,[50][51] did yoga and pilates in order to be as flexible as possible, and drew from his life experiences as inspiration.[52][53] Garfield admitted to shedding tears and trying to imagine "a better actor in the suit" upon first wearing his costume.[54] When filming, Garfield explained that he had four months of training and described his physical roles on stunts as challenging and exhausting.[55] Released in July 2012, The Amazing Spider-Man earned a worldwide total of $752,216,557.[56] Garfield's performance was generally well received.[57][58] The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw acclaimed his portrayal as the "definitive Spider-Man", Tom Charity of CNN commended his "combination of fresh-faced innocence, nervous agitation and wry humor", and Peter Travers, writing in Rolling Stone, said Garfield gave a stellar performance.[59][60][61] Associated Press' Christy Lemire elaborated that Garfield's Spider-Man gave the film a "restless, reckless energy and a welcome sense of danger."[62] Garfield reprised the role in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014).[63][64][65]
In March 2012, Garfield made his Broadway theatre debut as Biff Loman in the revival of Death of a Salesman.[66] Garfield was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play for his performance in the role.[67] According to The New York Times's David Rooney, Garfield "exposed the raw ache of Biff's solitude".[67]
On April 12, 2014, it was announced that Garfield would host Saturday Night Live on May 3, with musical guest Coldplay.[68] One of the skits, in which Garfield said he is not a fan of the song "Drunk in Love" by Beyoncé, and was subsequently targeted by a vicious agency called "The Beygency" along with Jack Bauer and Chloe O'Brien (who were fans of Rihanna), was reported on The Today Show.[citation needed] Garfield also appeared in a music video for the song "We Exist" by Arcade Fire, released on May 16, 2014,[69] playing a role of a drag queen.[70][71]
Garfield will star in the independent drama 99 Homes, which he also co-produced. He is scheduled to headline Martin Scorsese's film, Silence, based on Shūsaku Endō's 1966 novel of the same name. Production is scheduled to begin in 2014, with Garfield set to play Father Rodrigues, a Portuguese Jesuit priest in the seventeenth century who travels to Japan.[72]
Garfield maintains dual citizenship in the United States and the United Kingdom.[73] In a 2009 interview with the Sunday Herald, he said he "feels equally at home" in both the United States and the United Kingdom and "enjoys having a varied cultural existence".[74] Garfield customarily gives interviews about his work, but does not publicly discuss details of his private life.[75]
Garfield was in a relationship with actress Shannon Woodward from 2008 to 2011.[76] He has been in a relationship with actress Emma Stone since July/August 2011.[49][77][77] After Stone was cast in The Amazing Spider-Man, which was confirmed in October 2010,[77] Marc Webb, the film's director, noted that the chemistry between Garfield and Stone made her the clear choice.[77] That chemistry inspired their off-screen romance.[49]
In April 2013, Garfield publicly expressed his support for the legalisation of same-sex marriage. Garfield, who was reflecting on starring in the gay marriage-themed play Beautiful Thing (2006), commented: "There is no argument against equality. How can anyone argue against compassion and understanding?"[79]

      I'm very neurotic and self-conscious. So I think that I'll know when I'm becoming a dick and believing my own press.
      Obviously there's something very seductive about movies, which can be attractive in a bad way if you're doing them for the wrong reasons - for money, or for fame. I hope I won't ever do that. I don't feel at home in LA, I feel like I'm on holiday. It's nice to dip your feet in occasionally, but I think it's probably quite unhealthy to spend too much time there at once.
      I hope that I have to audition for every single job I want. I hope that I'm always struggling, really. You develop when you're struggling. When you're struggling, you get stronger.
      [on Hollywood parties/events] - Those events that look like so much fun in the photos you see-it's mostly people looking over their shoulders at everyone. They're miserable, those parties.
      [on playing Peter Parker/Spider-Man] - I see it as a massive challenge in many ways. To make it authentic. To make the character live and breathe in a new way. The audience already has a relationship with many different incarnations of the character. I do, as well. I'm probably going to be the guy in the movie theater shouting abuse at myself. But I have to let that go. No turning back. And I wouldn't want to.
      [on having to work out for his role as Peter Parker/Spider-Man] - I want to feel stronger than I've ever felt, and I want to feel more flexible than I've ever felt. I want to feel powerful. You don't just want to be a pack of meat-it has to be an open body. It does something to your psyche, and it does something to the way you move.
      [on not expecting to get the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man and then how he felt when he found out he got it] - I was genuinely expecting 'You're just a shit actor' instead of 'We want you to do it.'... I realized immediately how much hard work it was going to be, and how much of a minefield it was going to be in terms of all the shit that comes with it. Stuff that I would like to not have any part of. I mean visibility and being recognized walking down the street. I'm holding out a naive and ignorant hope that it won't happen.I couldn't gag the 5-year-old self inside of me. I said, 'What should we do?' And he was like, - [at this point Andrew slips into an accent] - 'DO IT! DO IT! DO IT! DO IT! Are you fuckin' kiddin' me? It's Spider-Man!' My inner 5-year-old is a New Yorker with a smoker's cough and a horrible mouth.
      [on filming the scene in The Social Network (2010), in which his character, "Eduardo Saverin", loses his cool and lashes out both physically and verbally at "Mark Zuckerberg", played by Jesse Eisenberg] - Are you kidding me? That day and night of shooting was one of my favorite experiences. I was actually proud of myself because I didn't care what I was doing. I was literally not judging myself. And it was so fucking beautiful for a second. I've gone through my whole life caring deeply what people think of me. That was probably one of the first times where I didn't care for a second. And it was liberating. I felt more like a man than I've ever felt.... That's what always excited me about other people's performances. Abandon.
      [on not watching movies that he's in] - If I watch myself, then I suddenly have a bunch of things that I'm scared to do. It just upsets me. I've stopped reading reviews, as well. If one is negative, you hold on to that. It was killing me. It was holding me back from being creative and being free.... The first thing that was written was, [on the subject of blogs and message boards] - 'What's up with this kid's eyebrows? He looks like a friggin' Neanderthal.'
      I hope this period doesn't end. I hope I never blow up. I hope that I have to audition for every single job I want. I hope that I'm always struggling, really. You develop when you're struggling. When you're struggling, you get stronger.
      The actors that excite me and inspire me are not selfish actors, they do it with purpose. They create characters and tell stories with purpose and generosity for an audience. It's all to serve a story and the themes of the story. That's what excites me. I look at Daniel Day-Lewis, the detail of his performances and how lived in they are. He truly experiences every character's reality that he steps into, that inspires me as well. The potential for exploring aspects of yourself that have been covered up for years or aspects of yourself you didn't realize you had. To step into someone else's shoes like Daniel Day-Lewis does so fully or like DeNiro does so fully.
      [on where his guilt complex comes from] Being Jewish and, yes, I'm sure it stems from being privileged. I was brought up in a middle class home. I went to private school. And I was always very aware of me not earning that.
      [on performing the role of Biff in 'Death of a Salesman' on Broadway] The repetition of going through trauma every night onstage is a killer. Your body doesn't know it's not real, even if your mind does. So your body is in a lot of pain, and your heart is in a lot of pain, but it's worth it. I will always think about that theater experience, and it will be very close to me.
      [on playing Spider-Man] I was just so invigorated and challenged and joyous about it. I was all bruised up and scratched up and it felt really good. Throwing myself against walls, which is incredibly exciting and painful and manhood-testing. It was so much fun.
      Whenever I'm not on stage I wanna watch reality television... I wanna watch, like, The Voice or The Bachelor... Don't be surprised by that -- it's the greatest show on TV!
      I don't mind the Jesus parallel for Spider-Man. Jesus is an awesome guy. Whether he was real or fake, he did some really sick stuff. When Pontius Pilate said: "They say you're the son of God. If you're the son of God, tell me." Jesus was like: "I know who I am, bitch." I don't know if he said "bitch". Maybe he didn't curse up Pontius Pilate. But that was a cool thing. Peter is not that evolved. Peter wants to tell the world he's a good guy: "Like me: I'm nice." He's a 19-year-old kid. He's a kid struggling with being misunderstood. We've all been misunderstood. That's universal too. I like being Peter.
      Spider-Man is neurotic. Peter Parker is not a simple dude. He can't just switch off... He never feels like he's doing enough. And Peter suffers from self-doubt. He ums and ahs about his future because he's neurotic. He's Jewish. It's a defining feature.

Like most teenagers, Peter is trying to figure out who he is and how he got to be the person he is today. Peter is also finding his way with his first high school crush, Gwen Stacy (Stone), and together, they struggle with love, commitment, and secrets. As Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, he begins a quest to understand his parents' disappearance - leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Curt Connors (Ifans), his father's former partner. As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors' alter-ego, The Lizard, Peter will make life-altering choices to use his powers and shape his destiny to become a hero.
In his highly acclaimed novel Never Let Me Go, Kazuo Ishiguro (The Remains of the Day) created a remarkable story of love, loss and hidden truths. In it he posed the fundamental question: What makes us human? Now director Mark Romanek (ONE HOUR PHOTO), writer Alex Garland and DNA Films bring Ishiguro's hauntingly poignant and emotional story to the screen.
Kathy (Oscar nominee Carey Mulligan, AN EDUCATION), Tommy (Andrew Garfield, BOY A, RED RIDING) and Ruth (Oscar nominee Keira Knightley, PRIDE & PREJUDICE, ATONEMENT) live in a world and a time that feel familiar to us, but are not quite like anything we know.

When they leave the shelter of the school and the terrible truth of their fate is revealed to them, they must also confront the deep feelings of love, jealousy and betrayal that threaten to pull them apart.

Blessed with the extraordinary gift of guiding the imaginations of others, Doctor Parnassus is cursed with a dark secret. An inveterate gambler, thousands of years ago he made a bet with the devil, Mr. Nick, in which he won immortality. Centuries later, on meeting his one true love, Dr. Parnassus made another deal with the devil, trading his immortality for youth, on condition that when his daughter reached her 16th birthday, she would become the property of Mr Nick.  
Valentina is now rapidly approaching this `coming of age' milestone and Dr. Parnassus is desperate to protect her from her impending fate. Mr. Nick arrives to collect but, always keen to make a bet, renegotiates the wager. Now the winner of Valentina will be determined by whoever seduces the first five souls. Enlisting a series of wild, comical and compelling characters in his journey, Dr. Parnassus promises his daughter's hand in marriage to the man that helps him win.  
In this captivating, explosive and wonderfully imaginative race against time, Dr. Parnassus must fight to save his daughter in a never-ending landscape of surreal obstacles and undo the mistakes of his past once and for all!

Andrew Garfield hosted Saturday Night Live for the first time this weekend, and got some advice from his not-so-surprise guest, Emma Stone — as well as a liplock from Coldplay singer Chris Martin.
Oh, snap! After 25 seasons, Fox's The Simpsons can still seem as fresh and inventive as when we first met this merrily mutant family — especially when the show raises its game as it does for this weekend's milestone 550th (!) episode (Sunday, 8/7c), a fantastical collaboration with LEGO in which all the elements of visuals, story and jokes click into place with spectacular results.
Seth Rogen returned to Saturday Night Live for his third hosting stint this weekend, and it was distinctly not a charm.
The episode started off promisingly, with Rogen's monologue featuring cameos from celebs — some surprising (Zooey Deschanel), some predictable (James Franco), and some who were there to support musical guest Ed Sheeran (Taylor Swift). But the rest of the night was a bit of a slog, save for a bizarre sketch featuring Franco as a monster who decides to get plastic surgery to appear human.
The 86th Academy Awards is less than a week away and the night is proving to be more star-studded than ever.
On Monday, producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron announced the complete slate of stars who will be on stage to present alongside the previously announced Daniel Day-Lewis, Jennifer Lawrence, Christoph Waltz and Anne Hathaway -- last year's acting winners. 
The marquee lights on Broadway will be dimmed for one minute Wednesday evening in honor of Philip Seymour Hoffman, who died Sunday at age 46 of an apparent drug overdose.
