      Was cast in The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) after Anthony Minghella saw him in The Wisdom of Crocodiles (1998). Minghella's wife was producing the film at the time and used to watch the dailies at home after each day's filming.
      He attended the private school Alleyn's in Dulwich, London. It was originally known as "The College of Gods Gift".
      [...] you go to the National with your parents and think: 'I'd love to be here.' And then suddenly you are. It's a dream come true.
      I've always thought Prince Charming in Cinderella was the most boring role; I'd rather be the Wicked Witch.
      I honestly have no interest in celebrity whatsoever. If anything, I always cringe at it because it takes away from what I am, which is an actor who wants to be better and do better things.
      Success, and even life itself, wouldn't be worth anything if I didn't have my wife and children by my side. They mean everything to me.
      I have no problem with nudity. My friend Ewan McGregor and I are starkers in most of our films.
      I think it's a bigger risk following a part that plays up your looks than it is to try and carve out a career as an actor.
      On his role in The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) - "I told Anthony that if I play Dickie Greenleaf, I want to eat in the best restaurants and drink the best wines every night because he would".
      {About working on Enemy at the Gates (2001)) "Yeah, I got blown up, cut up...I remember actually, when I had to go the Ripley premiere which was happening at that time, I arrived with this huge gash in my head. Very cool, really".
      (About his injury during Dickie's death scene in The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)) "Matt [Damon] broke my rib! But I think I strained his neck, we got a little bit carried away".
      (About how he got the role of "Gigolo Joe") "Through one of those fantastical phone calls when your agent calls you and says Steven Spielberg is on the phone, he wants to speak to you about his next film'. And once you've peeled yourself of the ceiling, you go *clears throat* Yeah, great".
      Bosie [from the movie Wilde (1997)] was the first part I was ever offered, which I suppose is sort of an insult because he's just the nastiest bastard!
      Well, I had to do a nude scene [in the play Indiscretions], and you're on stage naked but you get over it, you do whatever you have to do. But the first night, my character is just getting out of the bath, and the rest of the crew had poured in freezing cold water.
      The truth is, one can work for another ten years and be playing parts, pushing yourself as hard as you can, and you are still accused of that. You're still tainted with that brush. I'm not called Jude Law, I have three names; I'm called 'Hunk Jude Law' or 'Heartthrob Jude Law'. In England anyway, that's my full name. That's the cheap language that's thrown around, that sums you up in one little bracket. It doesn't look at your life. But if one looks beyond, there is actually a little bit more.
      I've always liked what Thomas More said in Utopia, which is that in Utopia every person is allowed their own lifestyle and religion but no one is allowed to stand on a soapbox and tell others that theirs is right. I thought that was brilliant. Brilliant.
      The only film I ever made for money was something called Music From Another Room, which I really didn't like.
      I only want to do the kind of work that I would like to go and see, that's going to teach me something new, that involves working with people I can learn something from and I can give something to.
      I never thought I had to forge a family, but it felt the most natural thing that ever happened to me - meeting someone and becoming a father.
      There were two instances where the police were called for whatever reason to my old house and they sold the story, telling lies. The police were responding to phone calls that happened, but they were then coming out and creating an atmosphere, a drama, when actually nothing had happened; there were no charges pressed. But that's the High Court and then the police selling stories, so how are you going to live in a country and feel safe?
      It's not ideal for me that they come out all one after the other in four or five months. I did them all because I found them very different different kinds of films, different kinds of parts. And I hope people recognize the variety rather than the onslaught". [on Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004), I Heart Huckabees (2004), Alfie (2004), Closer (2004) and The Aviator (2004) coming out within 6 months of each other. He actually did them in the last two years.]
      As a culture, the West has found itself in a strange, not battle of the genders, but battle in one's own gender. There's been so much equalizing that we've all kind of lost a little sense of who and what we're about, and a certain amount of definitions of who and what being a woman and being a man is about. It's almost like a murky middle ground that sometimes diffuses the definition and out of that has indeed spawned, in certain areas, misogynism.
      I just want to say I am deeply ashamed and upset that I've hurt Sienna and the people most close to us.
      (2004 quote) I've spent most of my free time the past 10 years traveling in Southeast Asia. It started with a trip to Vietnam, because we were told it could be a wonderful place to visit. I loved it and have been to Cambodia, China, Malaysia and Bali. Now I'm intrigued to see places like South America or Africa. I like the idea of constantly discovering.
      It was cold, very, very cold. I don't remember a lot of daylight, just endless hours of being buried in rubble, interrupted by lots of raising collective spirits by singing Russian folk songs. Can our genuine physical suffering be seen on film? I bloody hope so. (On filming Enemy at the Gates (2001)).
      It was the first time I felt I was making a script I believed in, and that I'd see something on screen close to what I'd hoped, rather than this vaguely confusing wilderness my jobs had been to this point. It was my first project with quality minds behind it, Jersey Films, Andrew Niccol and Ethan Hawke, who was a joy to work with. I felt we had a real meeting of the minds. (On making Gattaca (1997)).
      On his role in Artificial Intelligence: AI (2001): Steven Spielberg's approach to "Gigolo Joe" was the perfect middle ground, compared to Kubrick's far darker original vision. The character was originally much more aggressive, sinister, and far from Spielberg's revised conception as an innocent who's abused. He's a hooker who ultimately comes round to learning to love in a different way.
      "Hamlet" is a bit like a great song that's been covered by a load of different singers. It's like Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and Joni Mitchell all covering the same song. But they would each bring a different sound and colour to it (May 2009).
      [on his desire to make a foreign language film] I'd be very keen to act a foreign language film, especially French. I like Jacques Audiard - especially De rouille et d'os (2012) and Un prophète (2009) - and Michael Haneke, to me, he is probably the great director of the moment. His last four or five films have been pretty much faultless. I'd learn Congolese for him.
      [on working with Richard Shepard on 'Dom Hemingway'] We both sort of knew, from the off, that in order for the film to work, Dom had to work. And we both kind of fell in love with the character, and bonded over our mutual love of this insane, excessive rogue. I needed him and he needed me, and Dom needed both of us.
      I've never been a great believer in relying on good looks to get you through. To me it's all about the work and what you do in the workplace.
      [on stages in choosing acting roles] There's the part that feels like you get over the minefield of being 20 or early 30s in Hollywood..and stick your fingers up and go ''vanity has to go out the window and character has to come flying in'. It's kinda nice to shock people I suppose.
      [on playing 'Dom Hemingway'] It was a wonderful cathartic purge. There were nuances and tones to him, cause he's a deep and complicated and layered kind of human, as we all are. There's a wonderful kind of swagger that is incredible to step into. And that rubs off on you, you know? When you walk around in an electric blue suit and Cuban heel boots, you can't help but walk around with a bit of attitude.

David Jude Heyworth Law (born 29 December 1972), known professionally as Jude Law, is an English actor, film producer and director.[1][2]
He began acting with the National Youth Music Theatre in 1987, and had his first television role in 1989. After starring in films directed by Andrew Niccol, Clint Eastwood and David Cronenberg, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1999 for his performance in Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr. Ripley. In 2000, he won a Best Supporting Actor BAFTA Award for his work in the film. In 2003, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in another Minghella film, Cold Mountain. He is also known for his role as Dr. John Watson in the 2009 film Sherlock Holmes and its 2011 sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.
In 2006, he was ranked as one of the top ten most bankable film stars in Hollywood.[3] In 2007, he received an Honorary César and was named a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.[4][5] He was a member of the main competition jury at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.[6]
Law was born in Lewisham, South London, the second child of comprehensive school teachers Margaret Anne (née Heyworth) and Peter Robert Law; his father later became, according to Law, "the youngest headmaster in London".[1][7] He has a sister, Natasha.[7] Law was named after a "bit of both" the book Jude the Obscure and the Beatles song "Hey Jude".[7] He grew up in Blackheath, an area in the Borough of Greenwich,[8] and was educated at John Ball Primary School in Blackheath and Kidbrooke School, before attending Alleyn's School.[7]
In 1987, Law began acting with the National Youth Music Theatre.[9] He played various roles in the Edinburgh Fringe-awarded play The Ragged Child. One of his first major stage roles was Foxtrot Darling in Philip Ridley's The Fastest Clock in the Universe. Law went on to appear as Michael in the West End production of Jean Cocteau's tragicomedy Les Parents terribles, directed by Sean Mathias.[7] For this play, he was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Newcomer, and he received the Ian Charleson Award for Outstanding Newcomer.
Following a title change to Indiscretions, the play was reworked and transferred to Broadway in 1995, where Law acted opposite Kathleen Turner, Roger Rees and Cynthia Nixon.[10][11] This role earned him a Tony Award nomination[12] and the Theatre World Award.[13] In 1989, Law got his first television role, in a film based on the Beatrix Potter children's book, The Tailor of Gloucester. After minor roles in British television, including a two-year stint in the Granada TV soap opera Families, the leading role in the BFI /Channel 4 short The Crane, Law had his breakthrough with the British crime drama Shopping, which also featured his future wife, Sadie Frost, and a minor role in the episode "Shoscombe Old Place" in Granada's television series Sherlock Holmes.
In 1997, he became more widely known with his role in the Oscar Wilde bio-pic Wilde.[7] Law won the "Most Promising Newcomer" award from the Evening Standard British Film Awards for his role as Lord Alfred "Bosie" Douglas, the glamorous young lover of Stephen Fry's Wilde.[14] In Andrew Niccol's science fiction film Gattaca, Law played the role of a disabled former swimming star living in a eugenics-obsessed dystopia.[7] In Clint Eastwood's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, he played the role of the ill-fated hustler murdered by an art dealer, played by Kevin Spacey.
For The Talented Mr. Ripley in 1999, Law learned to play saxophone and earned an MTV Movie Award nomination with Matt Damon and Fiorello for performing the song "Tu vuò fà l'americano" by Renato Carosone and Nicola Salerno.
In 2001, Law starred as Russian sniper Vasily Zaytsev in the film Enemy at the Gates, and learned ballet dancing for the film A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001).[15] In 2002, he played a mob hitman in Sam Mendes's 1930s period drama Road to Perdition. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in The Talented Mr. Ripley in 1999, and then again for the Academy Award for Best Actor for Cold Mountain in 2003. Both films were directed by Anthony Minghella.[7]
Law, an admirer of Sir Laurence Olivier, suggested the actor's image be included in the 2004 film Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Using computer graphics, footage of the young Olivier was merged into the film, playing Dr. Totenkopf, a mysterious scientific genius and supervillain.[16][17] Also in 2004, Law portrayed the title character in Alfie, the remake of Bill Naughton's 1966 film, playing the role originated by Michael Caine;[7] and later took on another of Caine's earlier roles in the 2007 film Sleuth, adapted by Nobel Laureate in Literature Harold Pinter, while Caine played the role originated by Olivier.[18]
In 2006, he portrayed the role of Kate Winslet's single-parent brother in the film The Holiday, a modern day American romantic comedy written, produced and directed by Nancy Meyers. After his appearances in a string of period dramas and science fiction films in the early to mid-2000s, Law said he found it tricky to approach the contemporary role in this film. Like Winslet, the actor stated, he felt more vulnerable about playing a character who fitted his own look and did not require an accent, a costume or a relocation.[19]
Law was one of the Top Ten 2006 A-list of the most bankable film stars in Hollywood, according to the Ulmer Scale.[3] On 1 March 2007, he was honoured with the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres conferred by the French government, in recognition of his contribution to World Cinema Arts. He was named a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres.[4]
Law is one of three actors who took over the role of actor Heath Ledger in Terry Gilliam's film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. Along with Law, actors Johnny Depp and Colin Farrell portray "three separate dimensions in the film."[20][21] He appeared opposite Forest Whitaker in the dark science fiction comedy Repo Men and as Dr. Watson in Guy Ritchie's adaption of Sherlock Holmes, alongside Robert Downey, Jr. and Rachel McAdams, as well as the 2011 sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. Law starred as a celebrity supermodel in the film Rage,[22] and blogger and "prophet" Alan Krumwiede in the 2011 medical thriller Contagion.
In May 2009, Law returned to the London stage to portray the title role in Shakespeare's Hamlet at the Donmar Warehouse West End season at Wyndham's Theatre. The BBC reported "a fine and solid performance" but included other reviews of Law's interpretation that were mixed.[23] There was a further run of the production at Elsinore Castle in Denmark from 25–30 August 2009.[24] In September 2009 the production transferred to the Broadhurst Theatre in New York. Again, the critics failed to agree on the merit of Law's interpretation: London's Daily Mail found only positive reviews,[25] but The Washington Post felt that the much-anticipated performance was "highly disappointing".[26] Nonetheless, he was nominated for the 2010 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play.[27] In January 2010 at the Critics' Circle Theatre Awards ceremony he was presented with the John and Wendy Trewin Award for Best Shakespearean Performance for his 2009 Hamlet.[28]
Law is the face of the male perfume of Dior, Dior Homme Sport.[29][30][31] Since 2005, he has represented Dunhill as an "apparel ambassador" in Asia.[32] In 2008, he became the international face of Dunhill and appears in the worldwide advertising campaigns.[33]
In 2002, he directed a Respect for Animals anti-fur cinema commercial. The commercial, titled "Fur and Against", used music composed by Gary Kemp, and included appearances by Law, Chrissie Hynde, Moby, George Michael, Danny Goffey, Rhys Ifans, Sadie Frost, Helena Christensen, Sir Paul McCartney, Mel C and Stella McCartney.[34]
In early 2007 Law shot the Jason Martin-directed short film "Realtime Movie Trailer" at Borough Market, South London. Instead of promoting a film, this "trailer", which appeared among regular trailers in selected cinemas across London starting 19 November 2007, advertised a live event, Realtime Movie, by Polish artist Paweł Althamer. Hundreds turned up for this–unfilmed–re-enactment in real time of the sequence of events shown in "Realtime Movie Trailer" by the same actors, including Althamer as a Polish labourer, held at Borough Market on 30 November 2007. The performance was commissioned by Tate Modern as part of its "The World as a Stage" exhibition which explored the boundaries between arts and reality.[35][36][37][38]
In 2004, Law launched a campaign to raise £2.5 million towards the Young Vic Theatre's £12.5 million redevelopment project.[39][40] He is currently Chairman of the Young Vic committee and has said that he is proud to help make the Young Vic "a nurturing bed" for young directors.[41] In 2006, he joined Robbie Williams in the "Soccer Aid" celebrity football match to benefit UNICEF.[42]
In 2006, he starred in an anthology of Samuel Beckett readings and performances directed by director Anthony Minghella. With the Beckett Gala Evening at the Reading Town Hall, more than £22,000 was donated for the Macmillan Cancer Support.[43] Also in 2006, Frost and Law directed a Shakespeare play in a South African orphanage. He travelled to Durban with Frost and their children in order to help children who have lost their parents to AIDS. In July 2007, as patron of the charity, he helped kick off the month-long tour of the AIDS-themed musical Thula Sizwe by the Young Zulu Warriors.[44] Also in 2007, he encouraged the Friends of the Earth/the Big Ask campaign, asking British Government to take action against climate change.[45][46][47]
Law does charity work for organisations such as Make Poverty History, the Rhys Daniels Trust, and the WAVE Trauma Centre.[48] He supports the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Pride of Britain Awards.[49][50][51][52]
He is the chairman of the Music For Tomorrow Foundation to help rebuild Katrina-devastated New Orleans.[53][54]
Jude Law serves as an ambassador of the Prince of Wales' Children and the Arts Foundation.[55] He supports Breast Cancer Care,[56] and in December 2008 he supported the Willow Foundation with a small canvas for their campaign Stars on Canvas.[57] In April 2009 he supported the charity Education Africa with the gift of a mask he had painted and signed himself. The campaign was launched on eBay by Education Africa.[58]
Stars including Dame Judi Dench and Jude Law have helped save St Stephen's Church in Hampstead. The celebrities supported the campaign, which raised £4.5 million to refurbish the Victorian church in North London. The building reopened in March 2009 as an arts and community centre.[59][60]
In July 2007, Jude Law and Jeremy Gilley were in Afghanistan over a period of 10 days to document peace commitments and activities there for an upcoming film and for marking the UN International Day of Peace.[61][62] Accompanied by UNICEF Representative Catherine Mbengue, they travelled and filmed in dangerous areas of eastern Afghanistan with a film crew, interviewing children, government ministers, community leaders and UN officials.[63][64] They also filmed at schools and visited various UNICEF-supported programmes inside and outside the capital Kabul.[65][66] The efforts of Peace One Day are coordinated in celebration of the annual International Day of Peace, on 21 September.[67][68] The film, named The Day After Peace, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival.[69][70][71] On 21 September 2008, the film was shown at a gala screening at the Royal Albert Hall.[72]
On 30 August 2008, Law and Gilley returned to Afghanistan to help keep a momentum around Peace Day. They met President Hamid Karzai, top NATO and UN officials, and members of the aid community. They also screened the new documentary about the efforts in support of peace. The documentary features activities that took place throughout Afghanistan in 2007. It also highlights support from UNICEF and the WHO for the peaceful immunisation of 1.4 million children against polio in insecure areas.[73][74][75][76]
In 2011 Law joined street protests against Alexander Lukashenko and his brutal crackdown on the Belarusian democracy movement.[77]
Law's parents live in Vaudelnay, France, where they run their own drama school and theatre.[78] His sister Natasha is an illustrator and artist, living in London.[79][80]
Law met actress Sadie Frost while working on the film Shopping. They married on 2 September 1997 and divorced on 29 October 2003. He has three children with Frost: son Rafferty (born 1996), daughter Iris (born 2000), and son Rudy (born 2002).[81][82]
While making the film Alfie in late 2003, Law and co-star Sienna Miller began a relationship, becoming engaged on Christmas Day 2004.[83] On 8 July 2005, Law issued a public apology to Miller for having an affair with the nanny of his children.[84] It was also reported at the time that Miller had been having an affair with Daniel Craig.[85] Miller and Law separated in November 2006.[86]
On 29 July 2009, it was announced that Law would become a father for the fourth time following a brief relationship with American model Samantha Burke in 2008.[87][88] Burke gave birth to a daughter, Sophia, in September 2009 in New York.[89][90]
In December 2009, it was reported that Law and Miller had rekindled their relationship after starring in separate shows on Broadway in late 2009.[91] They spent Christmas 2009 in Barbados, along with three of Law's children.[92] They announced they had split again in February 2011.[93]

=======================================================
He was once voted the world's sexiest man and has been acting for over 20 years, but is better known for his tumultuous love-life. Will the Alfie star get Closer to serious acting and further from celebrity?
Jude Law was born in South London to teacher parents and was educated at John Ball Primary School in Blackheath, before moving on to a private school. By the age of 12 he was acting with the National Youth Music Theatre, and when he turned 17 he left formal education to take a part in the cult soap 'Families'.Early film roles in 'The Crane' and 'Shopping' failed to set the world of cinema alight and so the young actor returned to the stage to star in 'The Snow Orchid', 'Live Like Pigs' and 'Les Parents Terribles'.
The latter of these plays saw Jude nominated for an Olivier award as Best Newcomer and, following a title change to 'Indiscretions', the play transferred to Broadway in 1995.Again, the play was a huge success and Jude once again picked up another prestigious theatre award nomination – this time for a Tony. Moving back to film, Jude landed the part of 'Bosie' opposite Stephen Fry in 'Wilde'."Bosie was the first part I was ever offered, which I suppose is sort of an insult because he's just the nastiest bastard!"The film was applauded by critics and brought the young star to the attention of studio bosses in Hollywood. Jude suddenly became a busy man in films such as 'Music From Another Room', 'I Love You, I Love You Not', 'Gattaca' and 'Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil'.1999 saw Jude star in the film adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel 'The Talented Mr Ripley'. Cast as the playboy Dickie Greenleaf, Jude starred alongside Gwyneth Paltrow and Philip Seymour-Hoffman before being bumped off by an obsessed Matt Damon. Jude walked away with a BAFTA for his efforts and was also nominated for an Oscar.Steven Spielberg secured Jude's acting talents next to play Gigolo Joe in the sci-fi film 'AI'. The project was inherited from the late Stanley Kubrick and, although Jude received a Golden Globe nomination, critics were somewhat divided on the film's merits.Sam Mendes' 'Road To Perdition' saw Jude play a hit-man hot on the heels of Tom Hanks. Keen not to trade on his pretty-boy looks, Jude excelled as the twisted killer with a penchant for photographing his victims. Next up was the hugely successful epic 'Cold Mountain' with Jude as a traumatised Civil War soldier opposite Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger. The film was an Oscar magnet and saw Jude pick up his second nomination.Whilst his career was going from strength to strength, his personal life was beginning to attract an increased number of column inches. Having married Sadie Frost in 1997, the couple and their friends were dubbed the 'Primrose Hill set' and gossip about their social life became a tabloid obsession. The couple extended their family with the births of children Rafferty, Iris and Rudy. Sadie Frost already had one son, Finlay, with former Spandau Ballet star Gary Kemp.However, by the birth of Rudy in 2002, the couple's relationship was already heading for trouble. Jude's hectic work schedule and tabloid intrusion even led Nicole Kidman to sue The Sun newspaper over false reports of an affair with her handsome co-star. Jude and Sadie divorced in 2003.Jude began dating Sienna Miller after they met on the set of the remake of the film 'Alfie'. Taking on the role made famous by Michael Caine, Jude found himself working his charms on Susan Sarandon and Jane Krakowski. However, the film failed to charm both critics and audiences and was even voted one of the worst remakes of all time.A cameo as Errol Flynn in Martin Scorsese's 'The Aviator' saw Jude bounce back to form and 'Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow' performed well at the US box office. A run of credible roles in 'I Heart Huckabees', 'Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events', 'Closer' and 'All The King's Men’ saw Jude become one of the hardest working actors in Hollywood.However, in July 2005 it was his private life once again that dominated the headlines when he issued a public apology to his fiancée, Sienna Miller. The apology followed a kiss and tell story sold to a tabloid newspaper by his children's nanny, Daisy Wright, detailing her affair with the star.
"I just want to say I am deeply ashamed and upset that I've hurt Sienna and the people most close to us."Sienna immediately broke off the engagement and the tabloids again began to shadow the couple's every move. However, far from being a thing of the past, the couple became involved in what can best be described as an on/off relationship. After becoming a father for the fourth time, after a brief relationship with model Samantha Burke in 2008, Jude and Sienna rekindled their relationship.They got back together in December 2009 after starring in different shows on Broadway that year. The couple spent Christmas 2009 in Barbados with three of his children but they revealed they had split again in February 2011.His troubles off screen appear not to have affected his work as Jude highlighted in 2006's 'The Holiday', which landed him a nomination for an MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss, shared with co-star Cameron Diaz. He played the role of a book editor and single father in the American romantic comedy film, which was a commercial success despite receiving mixed reviews.Parts in 2007's 'My Blueberry Nights', 'Sleuth' and 'Rage' (2009) followed, before Jude appeared in 'The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'. He was cast in the film, alongside Johnny Depp and Colin Farrell, as transformations of the late Heath Ledger's character as he travels through a dream world. The move was necessitated by Ledger's untimely death before filming ended.Further critical acclaim came in 2009 in the form of a Saturn Award nomination for best supporting actor for his performance as Dr John Watson in Guy Ritchie's 'Sherlock Holmes'. Based on a tale created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the film starring Robert Downey Jr was a commercial success and helped to cement Jude’s acting abilities.In 2011, he played Hugo's father in Martin Scorsese's 'Hugo', appeared in 'Contagion' and reprised his role as Watson in 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows'. He also returned to the stage in 'Anna Christie'. It was announced on 15 March 2012 that Jude has been nominated for a Best Actor Olivier Award - the most prestigious in the world of theatre - for his role in the play.He will be playing Alexei Karenin in 'Anna Karenia' in 2012 as well as lending his voice to 'Rise of the Guardians'. In 2013, he will appear in 'The Bitter Pill' with Catherine Zeta Jones, Rooney Mara and Channing Tatum.

Although he first appeared as just one of the latest crop of golden-skinned English imports to caress the hormones of American filmgoers, Jude Law is steadily proving that his talents lie beyond his ability to smolder seductively in front of the camera. Since 1995, when Law made the transition from British soap opera to Broadway via Sean Mathias' Indiscretions (in which he co-starred with Kathleen Turner), his work has increasingly garnered favorable notice from critics and moviegoers alike. Born in London on December 29, 1972, Law started acting as a teenager. Before Indiscretions, his most notable role was in Shopping (1994), a British production that gave him both initial recognition and an introduction to his future wife, actress Sadie Frost (the couple has two children). After the critical and commercial success of Indiscretions, Law began finding more work in film, starring as Claire Danes' boyfriend in I Love You, I Love You Not (1997) and as the genetically privileged man who sells his identity to Ethan Hawke in Gattaca (1997). Also in 1997, Law took on the plum role of Alfred Lord Douglas (or Bosie), Oscar Wilde's volatile lover in Wilde. Although none of these films received unanimously positive critical (or box-office) attention, they did help to further establish Law as an actor to be taken seriously. Law followed them with a small part in Bent (1997) and the more pivotal role of Billy, Jim Williams' hotheaded and ill-fated lover in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997). Following that film, Law went on to make a few smaller films, including Music From Another Room (also starring a still unknown Gretchen Mol) and The Final Cut, in which he played a sinister, deceased version of himself. In 1999, Law appeared in David Cronenberg's cyberific eXistenZ and completed filming Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr. Ripley alongside Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt Damon, and Cate Blanchett. The film earned widespread acclaim upon its release, much of which was lavished on Law's portrayal of the serially charming and devastatingly superficial Dickie Greenleaf. Law garnered both a Golden Globe and Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance, further cementing his reputation as one of the more promising up-and-coming actors on either side of the ocean. After a turn as a Russian marksman facing off against a Nazi sniper in Enemy at the Gates (2001), Law returned to sci-fi with his role as love machine Gigolo Joe in Steven Spielberg's eagerly anticipated A.I.  In addition to his acting commitments, Law kept busy with Natural Nylon, the production company he founded with Sadie Frost, Sean Pertwee, Ewan McGregor, and Jonny Lee Miller.  In 2002, Law starred alongside film veterans Tom Hanks and Paul Newman in the multiple Oscar-winning Road to Perdition and was on the path to an Oscar once again for his performance in Cold Mountain (2003) with Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger, who took home the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.  After appearing in only two films in as many years, Law was virtually unavoidable in the last third of 2004, with substantial roles in a grand total of six films. First up, he played the title role in the blue-screened sci-fi action flick Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, starring alongside the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, and a "resurrected" Laurence Olivier. A month later, he could be found starring in the remake of Alfie as well as in the ensemble cast of David O. Russell's comedy I Heart Huckabees. And before the close of the year, audiences could catch him in Mike Nichols' romantic drama Closer, as Errol Flynn in Martin Scorsese's Howard Hughes biopic The Aviator, and providing the voice of the title character in the big-screen adaptation of Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events. Produced on an elephantine, effects-heavy budget by the wunderkind, billon-dollar powerhouse Scott Rudin (The Firm, Sister Act) and starring Jim Carrey, the film opened in December 2004 and received average to positive notices; such commentators as Newsweek's Sean Smith, The Washington Post's Desson Thomson, and others championed it (one referred to it as "a Tim Burton movie without the weird shafts of adolescent pain"); others were nonplussed. Roger Ebert complained, "It's odd, how the movie's gloom and doom are amusing at first, and then dampen down the humor. Although many Unfortunate Events do indeed occur in "Lemony Snicket," they cannot be called exciting because everyone is rather depressed by them." The picture nevertheless did excellent box office. Alfie - a remake of the 1966 Michael Caine vehicle, with Law taking over the Caine role - didn't fare so well with critics but performed adequately at the box.  Law ducked out of films for a year or so between 2004 and 2005, which led Variety to ask, "Where in the world is Jude Law?" The actor apparently needed a vacation, but his absence was short lived: Law ended his sabbatical after a year or so, and triumphantly returns to cinemas in 2006. In All the King's Men, Law plays second-string fiddle to an over-the-top Sean Penn. A political tale adapted from Robert Penn Warren's novel by Schindler's List scribe Steven Zaillian (who also directs), the movie weaves the tale of a Huey Long-like southern demagogue (Penn). The film will hit cinemas across the U.S. in September '06. Law is also re-teaming with his Cold Mountain collaborator, Anthony Minghella, in Breaking & Entering. Over the next several years, Law would enjoy his status as a leading man, appearing in a number of films like the Sherlock Holmes franchise, Hugo, and Contagion. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi

=======================================================
British-born Jude Law began his stage career in George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion. At London's Royal Court he starred in a revival of Live Like Pigs and was nominated for a Tony Award for the Broadway production of the National Theatre's Les Parents Terribles in which he co-starred with Kathleen Turner, Eileen Atkins and Roger Rees.
In England, he received the Ian Charleson Award for Outstanding Newcomer for the same role which he originated on the London stage. As a youth, Law worked with the National Youth Music Theatre and has appeared in several productions in the West End and at the Royal National Theatre. At the Royal Court Theatre in London he starred in 'Tis Pity She's a Whore and Ion . Law played the lead in The Crane, a short film made for the British Film Institute which was shown as part of the 1992 London Film Festival. His Hollywood appearances include Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Gattaca and eXistenZ. In 1999, he co-starred with Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow in Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr. Ripley. As Dickie Greenleaf, Law earned a Golden Globe and Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He has proven to be a much in-demand actor since then, earning up to $10 million per picture, with roles in big budget Hollywood films such as Enemy At The Gates (2001), Steven Spielberg's Artificial Intelligence: AI (2001) for which he received a second Golden Globe nomination, and Road To Perdition (2002), starring alongside Paul Newman and Tom Hanks. Law received his third Golden Globe nomination and his second Oscar nod for his role in the Civil War drama Cold Mountain (2003), playing Nicole Kidman's shy but honorable sweetheart.  
He has since continued to land roles alongside many big stars, such as playing the famous Dr. Watson opposite Robert Downey Jr. in Sherlock Holmes (2009) and its 2011 sequel Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows. He also starred in the well-received animated film Hugo (2011), the intense thriller Contagion (2011) and the drama 360. That's not all—he also provided the voice of the villainous Boogey Man in Rise of the Guardians (2012) and landed the role of Alexei Karenin in the film adaptation of Anna Karenina (2012). He most recently starred in Dom Hemingway (2014). 
Law was married to actress Sadie Frost from 1997 to 2003. They have three children together. He proposed to Alfie (2004) co-star Sienna Miller on Christmas Day 2004, but the engagement fell through when he cheated on her several months later with his children's nanny. He has since had a daughter (in 2009) with a former girlfriend. Later that same year, Law reportedly rekindled his relationship with Miller but broke up again in February 2011.
