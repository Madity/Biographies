For details about Mary-Kate Olsen's career and activities shared with her sister, see Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.
Mary-Kate Olsen (born June 13, 1986)[1] is an American actress, fashion designer, producer, author, and businesswoman. She co-founded luxury fashion brands The Row, Elizabeth and James, and the more affordable lines Olsenboye and StyleMint alongside her twin sister Ashley Olsen. Olsen pursued acting independently as an adult until 2012.[2]
Olsen was born in Sherman Oaks, California, the daughter of Jarnette "Jarnie" (née Jones;[3] b. 1954), a personal manager, and David "Dave" Olsen, a real estate developer and mortgage banker.[4] Along with her fraternal twin, Ashley, Olsen has an older brother, Trent; a younger sister, Elizabeth, who is also an actress), and two other siblings from her father's second marriage to McKenzie.[2] Olsen's parents divorced in 1998.
Along with Ashley, Olsen was cast at the age of nine months to share the role of Michelle Tanner on the ABC sitcom Full House. The Olsen twins portrayed Michelle throughout the series' 1987–95 run. In the early 1990s, she and Ashley established a company, Dualstar, which produced a long string of TV movies and direct-to-video releases featuring the girls. The Olsens continued to release direct-to-video films up to the early 2000s, along with starring in the 1995 feature film It Takes Two. In 1997, the Olsen twins guest starred in an episode of Sister, Sister, alongside fellow twin actresses Tia Mowry and Tamera Mowry. After Full House, the sisters starred in two other sitcoms (Two of a Kind and So Little Time) and an animated series (Mary-Kate and Ashley in Action!). The former lasted one season while the latter ran for two seasons. These ventures, combined with an array of licensing deals for their names and likenesses, made Olsen wealthy at a young age. In 2004, Olsen's wealth was estimated at $137 million.[5]
Olsen and her sister became co-presidents of Dualstar upon their eighteenth birthday. Olsen's first solo acting appearance was in the movie Factory Girl, released in December 2006. Olsen's one short scene was ultimately cut from theatrical release, but was included on the film's DVD. In 2007, the sisters said that if they became involved in movies together again it would be as producers.[6] Olsen had a recurring role on Weeds as Tara Lindman.[7] She appears in the 2008 film The Wackness as Union. At the Sundance Film Festival, co-star and Academy Award–winner Sir Ben Kingsley praised her.[citation needed]
Olsen made a one-episode appearance in 2008 on the ABC comedy Samantha Who?, playing a self-destructive girl whom Samantha tries to help while doing community service.[8] Olsen appeared in the movie Beastly, which was based on the book of the same name by Alex Flinn.[9] Olsen signed on to play Stacey in the movie Story of a Girl, but the movie appears to have been put on hold.[10]
In March 2012, she and Ashley expressed an interest in quitting acting for good in order to focus on their fashion career,[11] including the opening of a fashion shop,[12] as she considers fashion, rather than acting, as her future.[13]
In 2004, both Ashley and Mary-Kate became co-presidents of their company Dualstar (created in 1993 following the success of Full House), the brand currently selling in over 3,000 stores in America and 5,300 stores worldwide. Their success has been marked on Forbes The Celebrity 100 list since 2002, and in 2007 Forbes ranked the twins as the eleventh-richest women in entertainment, with an estimated combined net worth of $100 million.[14]
Following a high volume of public interest in their fashion choices, the sisters began work in collaboration on a string of fashion lines available to the public. Starting as young girls, the Olsen twins started a clothing line in Wal-Mart stores across America for girls ages 4 to 14 as well as a beauty line called "Mary-Kate and Ashley: Real fashion for real girls". In 2004 they made news by signing a pledge to allow all the workers that sew their line of clothing in Bangladesh full maternity leave. The National Labor Committee, which organized the pledge, later praised the twins for their commitment to worker rights.[15]
In 2006, in an attempt to gain credibility in the fashion industry after their association with Wal-Mart tarnished their reputations, they were tapped as the faces of the upscale fashion line Badgley Mischka.[16]
As adults, the Olsen twins have devoted much of their attention to the world of fashion. They head a couture fashion label, "The Row," as well as "Elizabeth and James", "Olsenboye", and "StyleMint"[17] retail collections. Mary-Kate's sometimes controversial fashion choices have often found her on both the best[18][19] and worst dressed fashion lists, particularly for her decision to wear fur.[20] Mary-Kate and Ashley designed an Olsenboye Change Purse in 2011 and donated the money to "Pennies From Heaven".[21]
In 2011, Mary-Kate and Ashley teamed up with TOMS Shoes to design footwear for kids without shoes in more than 20 countries worldwide.[22] Mary-Kate and Ashley are now the creative directors for Superga (brand).[23] Mary-Kate and Ashley released an Elizabeth and James perfume in Spring 2013.[24] The girls won the top prize at the 2012 CFDA Fashion Awards.[25] StyleMint is now available in the UK.[26]
In 2008, the Olsen twins co-authored Influence, a book featuring interviews with fashion designers that have inspired the twins' fashion lines.[28]
In 2004, Olsen graduated from Campbell Hall School and began attending New York University with Ashley. Both of them withdrew from NYU the following year, a few months apart, and returned to California. Also in 2005, Olsen ended her romance with Greek shipping heir Stavros Niarchos III. "I miss him and I adore him," Olsen said. "It's a hurtful and a painful subject." When asked if there was a specific reason for her leaving NYU, she replied, "I think we can all guess."[29]
Olsen has dated a number of prominent men. She dated Maxwell Snow, the younger brother of the late New York-based artist Dash Snow, from September 2006 until mid-2007.[30] In 2008, Olsen dated artist Nate Lowman. The two split in February 2010.[1] In May 2012, Olsen began dating Olivier Sarkozy, half brother of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy.[31] On March 2, 2014, it was reported that Olsen and Sarkozy were engaged. [32]
In mid-2004, Olsen announced she had entered treatment for an eating disorder, anorexia nervosa.[33][34] A Got Milk? ad featuring the twins was pulled following the announcement.[35][36] On November 20, 2007, she was hospitalized for a reported kidney infection.[37]
Mary-Kate was a close friend of late actor Heath Ledger.[38][39][40] After discovering Ledger unconscious in his bed in January 2008, his masseuse called Olsen twice before contacting police. Olsen sent a private security guard to the scene.[41]
Responding to a claim by an anonymous law enforcement official that she would not speak to federal investigators without a promise of legal immunity, Olsen's attorney Michael C. Miller said, "We have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding Mr. Ledger's death and the fact that Ms. Olsen does not know the source of the drugs Mr. Ledger consumed".[42]

=======================================================
Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Fuller Olsen (born June 13, 1986), also known as the Olsen Twins collectively, are American actresses and fashion designers. The sororal twins made their acting debut as infants playing Michelle Tanner on the television series Full House. At the age of six, they began starring together in TV, film, and video projects, which continued to their teenage years. Through their company Dualstar, the Olsens joined the ranks of the wealthiest women in the entertainment industry at a young age.
The twins were born in Sherman Oaks, California to David "Dave" Olsen[1] (b. 1953) and Jarnette "Jarnie" (née Jones;[2] b. 1954). Despite being very similar in appearance, they are not identical, but fraternal twins.[3] They have an older brother, Trent, and a younger sister, actress Elizabeth, as well as a half-sister, Courtney Taylor, and a half-brother, Jake.[4] The twins' parents divorced in 1995; Taylor and Jake are from their father's second marriage to McKenzie.[5] The Olsen twins have, English and Norwegian ancestry.[6]
In 1987, at the age of six months, the twins were cast in the role of Michelle Tanner on the ABC sitcom Full House. They began filming at nine months old. In order to comply with child labor laws that set strict limits on how long a child actor may work, the sisters took turns playing the role. The Olsens continued to portray Michelle throughout the show's run, which concluded in 1995.
In 1992, Mary-Kate & Ashley shared the role of Michelle Tanner when they guest-starred on the Full House crossover episode of Hangin' with Mr. Cooper. While starring on Full House, the Olsens also began appearing (as separate characters) in films for video and television. The first such film, To Grandmother's House We Go, debuted in 1992 and featured cameos from several other Full House actors. In 1993, the Olsens established the company Dualstar, which would produce the twins' subsequent films and videos, including that year's Double, Double, Toil and Trouble and 1994's How the West Was Fun. A series of musical mystery videos called The Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley premiered in 1994 and continued through 1997.
In 1995, following the end of Full House, the Olsens made their feature film debut in It Takes Two, co-starring Steve Guttenberg and Kirstie Alley. In the same year, they introduced a second video series, You're Invited to Mary-Kate & Ashley's..., which continued to release new entries until 2000.
The following year, the Olsens appeared in an episode of All My Children.[7] Also in 1998, the twins returned to series television with another ABC sitcom, Two of a Kind, co-starring Christopher Sieber as their characters' widowed father. The series lasted only one season, but aired in reruns on cable for several years afterward. 1998 also saw the release of Billboard Dad, the first of a new string of direct-to-video films starring the Olsens. The final such film, When in Rome, debuted in 2002.
In 2000, the Olsens appeared in an episode of 7th Heaven as bad-girls Sue & Carol Murphy.[8] The following year, the sisters starred in two new series: So Little Time, a live-action sitcom on Fox Family (later ABC Family); and Mary-Kate and Ashley in Action!, an animated series airing Saturday mornings on ABC. Both shows were cancelled after one season, although Mary-Kate received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for her performance on So Little Time.
In early 2004, Mary-Kate & Ashley had a cameo voice role in an episode of The Simpsons as the readers of Marge's book-on-tape, The Harpooned Heart.[9] Also in 2004, the twins starred in a second feature film, New York Minute. It would be their last film together, as well as Ashley's last acting role. Mary-Kate has continued to appear in film and television.
Mary-Kate and Ashley had a fan club until 2000, "Mary-Kate & Ashley's Fun Club", where fans would pay to receive Mary-Kate & Ashley collectibles and photos. Each subscription included an issue of "Our Funzine", Mary-Kate & Ashley's fan club magazine, exclusively available through the club, and a collectibles catalog, where one could purchase T-shirts, posters, baseball caps, key rings, school folders, postcards, and various other items. Subscribers would also receive "surprise gifts" (usually key rings, book excerpts, or back-issues of the Funzine), lyric sheets to Mary-Kate and Ashley's songs, a school folder, a membership card, a full-sized poster, two black & white photos (one of each girl), and a color photo with reprint autographs. The club was advertised at the beginning of Mary-Kate & Ashley movies until 1998.[10]
Mary-Kate and Ashley were popular figures in the preteen market during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Their names and likenesses extended, not only to movies and videos, but to clothes, shoes, purses, hats, books, CD's and cassette tapes, fragrances and makeup, magazines, video and board games, dolls, posters, calendars, and even telephones and CD players—with a market share made up mostly of the tween demographic. Mattel produced various sets of Mary-Kate and Ashley fashion dolls from 2000 to 2005, along with separate outfits and accessory packs.
The sisters became co-presidents of Dualstar on their 18th birthday in 2004. Upon taking control of the company, Mary-Kate and Ashley made moves to secure the future of the company by releasing products that appealed to the teen market, including home decoration and fragrances.[11] The Dualstar brand has been sold in more than 3,000 stores in the United States and over 5,300 stores worldwide.[12] The Olsens have appeared on the Forbes "Celebrity 100" list since 2002; in 2007, Forbes ranked them (collectively) as the eleventh-richest women in entertainment, with an estimated net worth of US $100 million.[13]
As the sisters have matured, they expressed greater interest in their fashion choices, with The New York Times declaring Mary-Kate a fashion icon for pioneering her signature (and now popular among celebrities and fans alike) "homeless" look.[14] The style, sometimes referred to by fashion journalists as "ashcan" or "bohemian-bourgeois",[15] is similar to the boho-chic style popularized in Britain by Kate Moss and Sienna Miller. The look consists of oversized sunglasses, boots, loose sweaters, and flowing skirts, with an aesthetic of mixing high-end and low-end pieces.[15] The twins were tapped as the faces of upscale fashion line Badgley Mischka in 2006.[16]
The Olsens had a clothing line for girls ages 4–14 in Wal-Mart stores across North America, as well as a beauty line called "Mary-Kate and Ashley: Real fashion for real girls". In 2004, they made news by signing a pledge to allow full maternity leave to all the workers that sew their line of clothing in Bangladesh. The National Labor Committee, which organized the pledge, praised the twins for their commitment to worker rights.[17]
The Olsens have also launched their own couture fashion label, "The Row", named after Savile Row in London.[18] In 2007, they launched Elizabeth & James, a contemporary collection inspired by many of their unique vintage finds and pieces in their personal wardrobes. They have also released a women's clothing line for J.C. Penney, called Olsenboye, and a t-shirt line called "StyleMint".[19] In 2008, the sisters published the book Influence, a compilation of interviews with many of the most prominent people in the field of fashion. In August 2013, the twins launched a new fashion line in Oslo, Norway.[20]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          She and her twin sister, Ashley Olsen, were born June 13, 1986 in Sherman Oaks, California to David and Jarnette Olsen. The twins began their acting career in 1987 when they were chosen to play the role of Michelle Tanner on a new television series, Full House (1987).

      Had a bi-monthly magazine called "Mary-Kate and Ashley Magazine" that only ran for three issues.
      In 1993 she and Ashley were supposed to play young Eves (Teena and Cindy) on The X Files (1993), but were eventually replaced by the Krievins twins (Erika Krievins and Sabrina Krievins) from the nearby of Vancouver. The reason were very strict child labor laws.
      On their 17th birthday (June 13, 2003), the US's Cable News Network (CNN) announced not only their birthday but the twins' total financial worth - $150,000,000 for each. The same news source predicted the twins may be billionaires by the time they're 21.
      During the earlier seasons of Full House (1987), the producers did not want it known that Michelle was played by twins, so Mary-Kate and Ashley were credited as Mary Kate Ashley Olsen.
      She and her sister became the youngest self-made millionaires in American history before they were 10 years old.
      Voted the 20th most wanted young star for the new year by Access Hollywood (1996) and The-N networks. Her twin sister Ashley wasn't part of the honor.
      She and Ashley both missed their high school prom to host Saturday Night Live (1975). The cast made it up to them by giving them a fake prom when they did their monologue.

      Back in school with sisters Ashley and Lizzie, while preparing to graduate and celebrate her and Ashley's 18th birthday. [June 2004]
      Currently in Sydney, Australia, with her sister to promote their clothing line. [February 2006]

      I get extra time to take the test because of my ADD. Everybody's brains works differently and I just need longer for things to register Upon taking her SATs.
      I like to go to parties where I know everyone. How are you going to have fun with people you don't know? - On going to Hollywood parties.
      We get along really well, but TV and film aren't reality. We're best friends, but we do have our fights!
      I learned how to play the drums. When we were in preproduction, when we were still in LA, I had a couple of drum lessons and then some in Toronto. I got the one beat down and that was it.
      I usually do get the tomboy parts in the movies, which is kind of like me, but not totally. I like to shop as much as Ashley, but she is a little more of a girlie-girl than me.
      Australia is so cool that it's hard to even know where to start describing it. The beaches are beautiful; so is the weather. Not too crowded. Great food, great music, really nice people. It must be a lot like Los Angeles was many years ago.
      I wear weird things sometimes. I like to drink coffee. Neither of those things have anything to do with who I am.
      Our relationship is stronger when we don't live together, so we don't live together. We're separate people, and we have separate lives. But we see each other every single day.
      I'm a person that has high highs and low lows. A lot of things make me sad. Sometimes it's almost easier to be sad. But you do end up finding a balance and I think that as I get older I am learning what I can do for myself to make me happy.
      We have been trying to teach the media that it's 'Mary-Kate' and 'Ashley' Olsen since we were 12 years old. I guess... I guess you just learn to accept it.
      Now that I'm older I'm more aware of things that make me feel more complete as a person. I'm trying to concentrate on those things as opposed to things that make me feel empty.

Sure enough they got the part. They played on the show 'till they were 9 years old. The show went off the air and people thought this was the end of their career. They had other ideas. Mary Kate and Ashley got together with their lawyer/manager and formed a company called Dualstar. Since then they have made 13 movies, put out 169 books, and have 5 TV shows. They are hoping to make many more movies in their time. They have just turned 16 and their presents were Range Rovers - Ashley's is black and Mary Kate's green.
      In real life she and Mary-Kate are very close to John Stamos, who played their uncle Jesse on Full House (1987).
      Enjoys shopping, going to the movies, listening to rock music (i.e. Counting Crows), cheer-leading and Tae Bo with her sister.
      She and Mary-Kate both had to wear fake teeth during the later years of "Full House" because their baby teeth were falling out. However, the director made an exception when the girls lost their two front teeth.
      Had a bi-monthly magazine called "Mary-Kate and Ashley Magazine" that only ran for three issues.
      When she was young, she and Mary-Kate used to call their Full House (1987) co-stars by their characters names so they wouldn't mess them up during taping.
      In 1993 she and Mary-Kate were supposed to play young Eves (Teena and Cindy) on The X Files (1993), but were eventually replaced by the Krievins twins (Erika Krievins and Sabrina Krievins) from the nearby of Vancouver. The reason were very strict child labor laws.
      On their 17th birthday (June 13, 2003), the U.S.'s Cable News Network (CNN) announced not only their birthday but the twins' total financial worth -- $150,000,000 for EACH. The same news source predicted the twins may be billionaires by the time they're 21.
      During the earlier seasons of Full House (1987), the producers did not want it known that Michelle was played by twins, so Mary-Kate and Ashley were credited as Mary Kate Ashley Olsen.
      She and her sister became the youngest self-made millionaires in American history before they were 10 years old.
      14 February 2005 - she filed a $20M libel suit against the "National Inquirer" for alleging her involvement in a drug scandal.
      She donated many signed head-shots to Rocky Stone to be auctioned off to raise money to buy more toys for less fortunate kids as part of the Toy Mountain Campaign 2004.
      Her film New York Minute (2004) earned only $5.96 million during its opening weekend. This was the lowest amount ever earned for any film opening in over 3,000 theaters.
      She and her sister Mary-Kate were both ranked#6 in E's 50 most cutest child stars all grown up.(2005)
      Ranked #37 on the Maxim magazine Hot 100 of 2007 list. (She was listed alone, her sister Mary-Kate did not appear anywhere on the list).
      Was ranked #5 on Forbes List of The 20 Top-Earning Young Superstars.(2007). with sister Mary Kate.
      Was cast as "Christie" in The Informers (2008) but dropped out at the last minute for undisclosed reasons. She was replaced by Amber Heard.
      She and her sister originally had their ears pierced when they were ten, but the piercings became infected and they had to remove the earrings and let the holes in their ears heal up. They then waited until they were sixteen before having them pierced again.
      Ranked #47 on the Maxim magazine Hot 100 of 2008 list. (Once again she was listed alone, her sister Mary-Kate was not on the list.).
      Abandoning her acting career to pursue her dream of fashion designing full-time [May 13, 2009].
      In May 2000, she and her sister, Mary-Kate Olsen, dedicated the Holland-America Line cruise ship, the "MS Zaandam".
      Mary-Kate and Ashley now run four clothing lines called "The Row", "Elizabeth and James", "Olsenboye", and "StyleMint".
      She helped in raising 2,206 toys for the Less Fortunate Kids as part of the 2005 Toy Mountain Campaign with Kids Talent Agent Rocky Stone. [December 2005]
      The girls decided to retire from acting for good and focus on fashion. In 2009 Ashley contemplated quitting fashion and going back to acting. Mary-Kate and Ashley are now living in New York, NY. [March 2012]
      Finishing last year of high school with sister Mary-Kate at a private school in North Hollywood, California and filming their new movie New York Minute (2004) in New York & Toronto. [August 2003]
      Currently in Sydney, Australia, with her sister to promote their clothing line. [February 2006]
      We've stayed really normal and down to Earth I think, and haven't let the success thing go to our head.
      (about Mary-Kate) "She's always there for me when I need her; She's my best friend; she's just my everything."
      Some twins feel like they need to compare themselves to each other, but we're not that way. That's because of my parents, though, and having six kids in the family.
      Lizzie plays club volleball and Trent is an amazing writer. We're lucky our parents didn't stereotype us, so we could figure out who we are for ourselves.
      Since we were 9 years old we've been seeing ourselves everywhere. We're so used to it, it doesn't really affect us. - on her world-wide fame alongside her sister Mary-Kate
      I'm the type of person who would rather stay home than get my picture taken. I'm the most private person.
      I don't think you necessarily need to show off your stomach and boobs to be sexy. I'm just not attracted to that type of dressing.
=======================================================
At 18, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen aren’t just rich and ambitious, they are mini-moguls. They are already worth $40 million and counting.
Born in Sherman Oaks to David Olsen and Jarnette Fuller, Mary-Kate and Ashley Fuller Olsen also have an older brother, Trent, and younger sister, Elizabeth, as well as two half-siblings, Taylor and Jake. The twins' parents divorced in 1995, and Taylor and Jake are the children from their father's second marriage.
Not quite identical twins but close enough to act the same part on TV, Mary-Kate and Ashley began splitting a role on the popular sitcom, Full House, literally before they could walk. By the age of four they were child stars, the lynch-pin of the show and earning a pittance.
When he saw how little the girls were paid, Robert Thorne, a producer, asked the twins’ parents if he could represent them. He secured a raised of $150,000 each per episode. “Full House” was cancelled in 1995 and Thorne took a chance and cast the twins in their own adventure videos.
The films, full of clean fun, immediately appealed to the ‘tweenies’, kids who have grown out of cartoons and are not yet into teen movies. Thorne founded a company called Dualstar and made the seven year old girls executive producers. Together the trio hired directors, writers and oversaw the entire presentation of the Dualstar brand.
As the sisters grow older and mature in their style, there has been greater interest in their fashion choices. The New York Times declared Mary-Kate a fashion icon for pioneering her signature "Boho-chic" look, consisting of oversized sunglasses, boots, loose sweaters, and flowing skirts.
Mary-Kate and Ashley have a clothing line in Wal-Mart stores across America for girls ages 4-14, as well as a beauty line called "Mary-Kate and Ashley: Real fashion for real girls". They have also been working on a new couture label 'The Row' named after the famous Savile Row of London.
In 2004, Mary-Kate checked into rehab for six weeks because she was suffering from an eating disorder. It was rumoured that there was also a drug problem, but the Olsens' publicist denied this. Mary-Kate put on about five to seven pounds immediately after her stint in rehab.
The following year, Mary-Kate ended her romance with Greek shipping heir Stavros Niarchos III, who later began dating hotel heiress and socialite Paris Hilton.

The Olsen TwinsActor / TwinsBorn: 13 June 1986Birthplace: Sherman Oaks, CaliforniaBest known as: The twins from TV's Full HouseThe Olsen Twins, Mary-Kate and Ashley, have been on TV since infancy, when they began sharing the role of the baby Michelle on the syndicated comedy Full House (1987-95). Fraternal twins who look remarkably alike, they were born on June 13, 1986. The twins created their own little empire of TV movies, videos, books, magazines and a fashion line -- all by the age of fifteen. Their work includes two video series, The Adventures of Mary-Kate and Ashley and You're Invited to Mary-Kate and Ashley's, films such as How The West Was Fun (1994) and Getting There (2002) and the short-lived television series Two of a Kind (1998-99) and So Little Time (2001). Their first big-budget feature as grown-up teens, New York Minute, was released in 2004. In 2004 they moved to New York City to attend New York University; both left school without graduating. They have since focused on fashion, launching their own high-fashion line called The Row, and (in 2011) a T-shirt line at StyleMint.com.Extra credit: Ashley is slightly taller and a few minutes older than Mary-Kate... Mary-Kate is the one who had the much-publicized eating disorder.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC. All rights reserved.More on Olsen Twins from Infoplease:
