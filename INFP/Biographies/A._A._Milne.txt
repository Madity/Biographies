=======================================================
Alan Alexander Milne (/ˈmɪln/; 18 January 1882 – 31 January 1956) was a British author, best known for his books about the teddy bear Winnie-the-Pooh and for various children's poems. Milne was a noted writer, primarily as a playwright, before the huge success of Pooh overshadowed all his previous work.
A. A. Milne was born in Hampstead, London[1] to parents John Vince Milne, who was Scottish,[2] and Sarah Marie Milne (née Heginbotham) and grew up at Henley House School, 6/7 Mortimer Road (now Crescent), Kilburn, a small public school run by his father.[3] One of his teachers was H. G. Wells, who taught there in 1889–90.[4] Milne attended Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge [5] where he studied on a mathematics scholarship, graduating with a B.A. in Mathematics in 1903. While there, he edited and wrote for Granta, a student magazine.[3] He collaborated with his brother Kenneth and their articles appeared over the initials AKM. Milne's work came to the attention of the leading British humour magazine Punch, where Milne was to become a contributor and later an assistant editor.
Milne joined the British Army in World War I and served as an officer in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and later, after a debilitating illness, the Royal Corps of Signals. He was recruited into Military Intelligence to write propaganda articles for MI 7b between 1916 and 1918. He was discharged on 14 February 1919,[6] and settled in Mallord Street, Chelsea.[7]
After the war, he wrote a denunciation of war titled Peace with Honour (1934), which he retracted somewhat with 1940's War with Honour.[3][8] During World War II, Milne was one of the most prominent critics of English writer P. G. Wodehouse, who was captured at his country home in France by the Nazis and imprisoned for a year. Wodehouse made radio broadcasts about his internment, which were broadcast from Berlin. Although the light-hearted broadcasts made fun of the Germans, Milne accused Wodehouse of committing an act of near treason by cooperating with his country's enemy. Wodehouse got some revenge on his former friend (e.g., in The Mating Season) by creating fatuous parodies of the Christopher Robin poems in some of his later stories, and claiming that Milne "was probably jealous of all other writers.... But I loved his stuff."[9]
Milne married Dorothy "Daphne" de Sélincourt in 1913, and their only son, Christopher Robin Milne, was born in 1920. In 1925, A. A. Milne bought a country home, Cotchford Farm, in Hartfield, East Sussex.[10]
During World War II, A. A. Milne was Captain of the Home Guard in Hartfield & Forest Row, insisting on being plain "Mr. Milne" to the members of his platoon. He retired to the farm after a stroke and brain surgery in 1952 left him an invalid, and by August 1953 "he seemed very old and disenchanted".[11] Milne died in January 1956, aged 74.
After graduating from Cambridge in 1903, A. A. Milne contributed humorous verse and whimsical essays to Punch,[12][13] joining the staff in 1906 and becoming an assistant editor.[14]
During this period he published 18 plays and 3 novels, including the murder mystery The Red House Mystery (1922). His son was born in August 1920 and in 1924 Milne produced a collection of children's poems When We Were Very Young, which were illustrated by Punch staff cartoonist E. H. Shepard. A collection of short stories for children Gallery of Children, and other stories that became part of the Winnie-the-Pooh books, were first published in 1925.
Milne was an early screenwriter for the nascent British film industry, writing four stories filmed in 1920 for the company Minerva Films (founded in 1920 by the actor Leslie Howard and his friend and story editor Adrian Brunel). These were The Bump, starring Aubrey Smith; Twice Two; Five Pound Reward; and Bookworms[15] Some of these films survive in the archives of the British Film Institute. Milne had met Howard when the actor starred in Milne’s play Mr Pim Passes By in London.[16]
Looking back on this period (in 1926), Milne observed that when he told his agent that he was going to write a detective story, he was told that what the country wanted from a "Punch humorist" was a humorous story; when two years later he said he was writing nursery rhymes, his agent and publisher were convinced he should write another detective story; and after another two years, he was being told that writing a detective story would be in the worst of taste given the demand for children's books. He concluded that "the only excuse which I have yet discovered for writing anything is that I want to write it; and I should be as proud to be delivered of a Telephone Directory con amore as I should be ashamed to create a Blank Verse Tragedy at the bidding of others."[17]

Milne is most famous for his two Pooh books about a boy named Christopher Robin after his son, Christopher Robin Milne, and various characters inspired by his son's stuffed animals, most notably the bear named Winnie-the-Pooh. Christopher Robin Milne's stuffed bear, originally named "Edward",[18] was renamed "Winnie-the-Pooh" after a Canadian black bear named Winnie (after Winnipeg), which was used as a military mascot in World War I, and left to London Zoo during the war. "The pooh" comes from a swan called "Pooh". E. H. Shepard illustrated the original Pooh books, using his own son's teddy, Growler ("a magnificent bear"), as the model. The rest of Christopher Robin Milne's toys, Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga, Roo and Tigger, were incorporated into A. A. Milne's stories,[19][20] two more characters - Rabbit and Owl - were created by Milne's imagination. Christopher Robin Milne's own toys are now under glass in New York.
The fictional Hundred Acre Wood of the Pooh stories derives from Five Hundred Acre Wood in Ashdown Forest in East Sussex, South East England, where the Pooh stories were set. Milne lived on the northern edge of the forest at Cotchford Farm, 51°05′24″N 0°06′25″E﻿ / ﻿51.090°N 0.107°E﻿ / 51.090; 0.107, and took his son walking there. E. H. Shepard drew on the landscapes of Ashdown Forest as inspiration for many of the illustrations he provided for the Pooh books. The adult Christopher Robin commented: "Pooh's Forest and Ashdown Forest are identical".[19] The wooden Pooh Bridge in Ashdown Forest, where Pooh and Piglet invented Poohsticks, is a tourist attraction.[21]
Not yet known as Pooh, he made his first appearance in a poem, "Teddy Bear", published in the British magazine Punch in February 1924. Pooh first appeared in the London Evening News on Christmas Eve, 1925, in a story called "The Wrong Sort Of Bees".[20] Winnie-the-Pooh was published in 1926, followed by The House at Pooh Corner in 1928. A second collection of nursery rhymes, Now We Are Six, was published in 1927. All three books were illustrated by E. H. Shepard. Milne also published four plays in this period. He also "gallantly stepped forward" to contribute a quarter of the costs of dramatising P. G. Wodehouse's A Damsel in Distress.[22] His book The World of Pooh won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958.
The success of his children's books was to become a source of considerable annoyance to Milne, whose self-avowed aim was to write whatever he pleased and who had, until then, found a ready audience for each change of direction: he had freed pre-war Punch from its ponderous facetiousness; he had made a considerable reputation as a playwright (like his idol J. M. Barrie) on both sides of the Atlantic; he had produced a witty piece of detective writing in The Red House Mystery (although this was severely criticised by Raymond Chandler for the implausibility of its plot). But once Milne had, in his own words, "said goodbye to all that in 70,000 words" (the approximate length of his four principal children's books), he had no intention of producing any reworkings lacking in originality, given that one of the sources of inspiration, his son, was growing older.
His reception remained warmer in America than Britain, and he continued to publish novels and short stories, but by the late 1930s, the audience for Milne's grown-up writing had largely vanished: he observed bitterly in his autobiography that a critic had said that the hero of his latest play (God help it) was simply "Christopher Robin grown up...what an obsession with me children are become!".
Even his old literary home, Punch, where the When We Were Very Young verses had first appeared, was ultimately to reject him, as Christopher Milne details in his autobiography The Enchanted Places, although Methuen continued to publish whatever Milne wrote, including the long poem 'The Norman Church' and an assembly of articles entitled Year In, Year Out (which Milne likened to a benefit night for the author).
He also adapted Kenneth Grahame's novel The Wind in the Willows for the stage as Toad of Toad Hall. The title was an implicit admission that such chapters as Chapter 7, "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn", could not survive translation to the theatre. A special introduction written by Milne is included in some editions of Grahame's novel.

The rights to A. A. Milne's Pooh books were left to four beneficiaries: his family, the Royal Literary Fund, Westminster School and the Garrick Club.[23] After Milne's death in 1956, his widow sold her rights to the Pooh characters to Stephen Slesinger, whose widow sold the rights after Slesinger's death to the Walt Disney Company, which has made many Pooh cartoon movies, a Disney Channel television show, as well as Pooh-related merchandise. In 2001, the other beneficiaries sold their interest in the estate to the Disney Corporation for $350m. Previously Disney had been paying twice-yearly royalties to these beneficiaries. The estate of E. H. Shepard also received a sum in the deal. The copyright on Pooh expires in 2026.[24] In 2008, a collection of original illustrations featuring Winnie-the-Pooh and his animal friends sold for more than £1.2 million at auction in Sotheby's, London.[25] Forbes magazine ranks Winnie the Pooh the most valuable fictional character; in 2002 Winnie the Pooh merchandising products alone had annual sales of more than $5.9 billion.[26]
A memorial plaque in Ashdown Forest, unveiled by Christopher Robin in 1979, commemorates the work of A. A. Milne and Shepard in creating the world of Pooh.[19] Milne once wrote of Ashdown Forest: "In that enchanted place on the top of the forest a little boy and his bear will always be playing".[19] In 2003, Winnie the Pooh was listed at number 7 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.[27]
His poems have been parodied many times, including with the books When We Were Rather Older and Now We Are Sixty.
Milne did not speak out much on the subject of religion, although he used religious terms to explain his decision, while remaining a pacifist, to join the army: "In fighting Hitler", he wrote, "we are truly fighting the Devil, the Anti-Christ ... Hitler was a crusader against God."[28]
The Old Testament is responsible for more atheism, agnosticism, disbelief—call it what you will—than any book ever written; it has emptied more churches than all the counter-attractions of cinema, motor bicycle and golf course.[29]
Lovers in London (1905. Some consider this more of a short story collection; Milne did not like it and considered The Day's Play as his first book.)

Winnie-the-Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, Tigger, and Kanga with little Roo in  her pocket—these are some of the best-loved characters in children's  literature. They began as stuffed toy animals that belonged to a boy  named Christopher Robin. They came to life in the imagination of the  boy's father, the writer A. A. Milne. Alan Alexander Milne was born in London on January 18, 1882. His  father, who was headmaster of a small private school, often read aloud  to his three sons, Barry, Ken, and Alan. Milne was very good at mathematics when he was a boy. Later, he  attended Trinity College, Cambridge, to study that subject. But he soon  became more interested in writing. In 1903, he returned to London to try  to make a living as a free-lance writer. He wrote humorous articles and  light verse. After two years, publishers were "getting used" to him, as  Milne described it. He became an assistant editor for the humor  magazine Punch in 1906. In 1913 he married Dorothy (Daphne) de  Sélincourt. Milne served in the army in World War I. After the war, he began to  write plays, many of which are still performed. The best known is Mr. Pim Passes By (1919). He wrote other works for adults—novels, essays, and his autobiography, It's Too Late Now (1939). The Red House Mystery (1921), a detective novel, is still popular. So is Toad of Toad Hall (1929), his play based on Kenneth Grahame's Wind in the Willows. But it was poems and stories for children that made him famous. Christopher Robin—or Billy Moon, as he called himself—was born in  1920. One day Milne wrote a poem about him called "Vespers" and gave it  to his wife as a present. She sent the poem to a magazine, and it was  published. Milne wrote more poems, which were published in two books, When We Were Very Young (1924) and Now We are Six (1927). In 1925, the Milnes bought a farmhouse in Sussex. This "enchanted  place on the top of the Forest" was the setting for Milne's stories  about Christopher Robin and Pooh. Other toy animals, as well as  creatures of the forest, joined in the adventures described in Winnie-the-Pooh (1926) and The House at Pooh Corner (1928). A. A. Milne had a special talent for presenting small children as  they are. He takes us into their private world of make-believe and funny  words—of "wheezles and sneezles," "haycorns," "expotitions," and  "biffalo-buffalo-bisons." All the pictures in the Christopher Robin  books were drawn by the well-known artist Ernest H. Shepard. His tiny  pen-and-ink figures exactly capture the mood of the books. A. A. Milne died on January 31, 1956. Pooh, Piglet, and the others now live at the New York Public Library.   "Milne, A. A. (1882–1956)." Reviewed by Christopher Milne. The New Book of Knowledge.

=======================================================
     (1882 - 1956) Scots by birth, Alan Milne spent his childhood in London, where his father was a preparatory schoolmaster. His early education owed much to the skills of a young teacher and mentor -- H.G. Wells -- years later, Milne described Wells as "a great writer and a great friend." He continued his education at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He bequethed his original handwritten manuscripts of Winnie-the-Pooh and The House At Pooh Corner to the College Library. While an undergraduate at Cambridge he edited Granta for a year -- his first literary efforts were published in the humourous magazine Punch, where a month after his twenty-fourth birthday he started work as Assistant Editor, remaining there until the outbreak of the First World War.In 1913, Milne married Dorothy Daphne de Selincourt and they had one son, Christopher. Although a noted pacifist, Milne enlisted in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and served in France. His famous denunciation of war entitled Peace With Honour was published in 1934. His writings met with great success between the wars and, in 1924, Methuen published When We Were Very Young, a collection of verses, many of which had already been eagerly read by his regular readers when they first appeared in Punch.  Two years later saw the introduction of the Bear of Very Little Brain in Winnie-the-Pooh. A second book of verses, Now We Are Six, appeared in 1927 and, in 1928, the final volume of the quartet arrived, The House At Pooh Corner. It had seemed to Milne at the time that he should be writing something meatier, like a detective story, which would hopefully earn £2,500! Even after the phenomenal success of Pooh, he was still to remain doubtful and wrote "I wanted to escape from them as I once wanted to escape from Punch as I have always wanted to escape. In vain ..."  In fact, in 1922 he wrote a detective novel, The Red House Mystery -- as well as many novels, essays, short stories and verses, he wrote over twenty-five plays and his autobiography It's Too Late Now was published by Methuen in 1939.  A.A. Milne always acknowledged that it was his wife, Daphne, and his young son, Christopher Robin, who inspired him to write the poems and stories. History has a strange way of mixing fact and fiction, but, whatever the origins, the four Pooh books printed in over twenty-five languages have taken their rightful place in the hearts and on the bookshelves of many millions of people.  In Which We are Introduced to Winnie-the-Pooh and Some Bees and the Stories Begin was first printed in the London Evening News on December 24th, 1925 and broadcast by the BBC on Christmas Day by Donald Calthrop.  Winnie-the-Pooh was published by Methuen on October 14th, 1926; but for too long, Milne's four classics have been relegated to children's bookshelves and Disney children's cartoons.  A. A. Milne didn't write the stories and poems for children. He intended them for the child within us all. He rarely read the stories and poems to his son Christopher, preferring to amuse him with the works of P.G. Wodehouse, one of Milne's favourite authors. This compliment was returned in full by Wodehouse, who described Milne as "about my favourite author." Christopher continued this reading pattern, also entertaining his daughter, Clare, with Wodehouse's classics.  Wodehouse's works continued to live long in the Milne household after his death, as Christopher frequently read the stories to his daughter, Clare and her bedroom shelves contain many of his novels. In a letter to Peter, Christopher wrote, "My father did not write the books for children. He didn't write for any specific market; he knew nothing about marketing. He knew about me, he knew about himself, he knew about the Garrick Club -- he was ignorant about anything else. Except, perhaps, about life."  Christopher first heard the stories and poems when he listened to Peter's recordings more than sixty years after their first publication.  The Pooh books are firm favourites with old and young alike and have been translated into almost every known language -- in a national reader's poll carried out in England by England premier booksellers, Waterstone's, and Channel 4 Television during 1996, Winnie-the-Pooh was placed number 17 in the list of the 100 most-popular books published during the 20th century.  The worldwide sales of the four books between 1924 and 1956 totalled about seven million. Amusingly, once sales passed a million, the publishers stopped counting!  Since 1968, sales of the Methuen edition have averaged over 500,000 a year, with 30 percent of these selling in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.  It is estimated that over seventy million copies of the four Pooh books have been sold since their first publication.  The Pooh books are favourites with old and young alike and have been translated into almost every language. In 1985, the Russian translation, Vinnie Pookh, sold more than three and a half million copies in the Soviet Union and, in the same year, the Latin version, Winnie Ille Pu, became the first book in a foreign language to be included in the bestseller list in the United States. There is now a companion volume, A. A. Milnei Domus Anguli Puensis, Librum exornavit E. H. Shepard, Liber alter de Urso Puo de anglico sermone in Latinum conversus auctore Briano Staplesio, Londinii: Sumptibus Methueni, MCMLXXX.  If, like Pooh, you are a Bear of Very Little Brain, I should explain that Brian Staples translated The House at Pooh Corner into Latin, published by Methuen in 1980. Brian had studied Latin as a young boy while at school and many years later, while ill in hospital had busied himself just for fun translating Milne's last Pooh book, with no thought whatsoever to completing it. Fortunately for us all, his fun became reality and the book was published with enormous success. Sadly, Brian's health deteriorated over several months during 1996 and he died of septicaemia in April that year, the same month as dear Christopher Milne passed away.  Before the success of the Pooh books, Alan Milne was a popular dramatist, novelist, and humourist and many of his plays were performed to great critical acclaim in both Europe and America. Today, his plays are rarely performed in the professional theatre, although amateur productions are playing in almost every English-speaking country throughout the world where they still attract large and eager audiences.  Visitors to this website are recommended to seek out his plays, novels and essays in their libraries and antiquarian bookshops. A detailed bibliography of Milne by Tori Haring-Smith was published in 1982 by Garland Publishing Inc. of New York. In 1990, Methuen published Ann Thwaite's definitive biography A. A. Milne His Life.  Milne's plays include: Worzel-Flummery, The Lucky One, The Boy Comes Home, Belinda, The Red Feathers, Make-Believe, Mr. Pim Passes By, The Camberley Triangle, The Romantic Age, The Stepmother, The Dover Road, The Truth about Blayds, The Great Broxopp Success, The Man in the Bowler Hat, To Have the Honour -- or Meet the Prince, Ariadne, Portrait of a Gentleman in Slippers, Miss Marlow at Play, The Ivory Door, Toad of Toad Hall, The Fourth Wall -- or The Perfect Alibi, Michael and Mary, Portrait of a Gentleman in Slippers, Other People's Lives, Miss Elizabeth Bennett, The Ugly Duckling and Before the Flood.  In 1952, Milne underwent an operation of the brain, which left him an invalid. He survived the operation and returned to his home at Cotchford Farm in Sussex, where he spent the rest of his life reading and in country pursuits. After a long illness, he died on 31st January, 1956.  Soon after the publication of Winnie-the-Pooh, Milne wrote in the Nation: "I suppose that every one of us hopes secretly for immortality; to leave, I mean, a name behind him which will live forever in this world, whatever he may be doing, himself, in the next." When he died, thirty years later, there was already no doubt at all that A. A. Milne had achieved more than the ordinary mortal's fifteen minutes of fame -- he had achieved an immortality equalled by few others, though not as he would have wished based on his huge literary output of plays and novels, but rather on the adventures of a Bear of Very Little Brain.  In 1996, his own favourite bear was sold by Bonham's auction house in London to an anonymous buyer in 1996 for £4,600.

						A. A. Milne was born in Kilburn, London, England to parents John Vine Milne and Sarah Maria (née Heginbotham) and grew up at Henley House School, 6/7 Mortimer Road (now Crescent), Kilburn, London, a small independent school run by his father. One of his teachers was H. G. Wells who taught there in 1889–90. Milne attended Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied on a mathematics scholarship.

Even his old literary home, Punch, where the When We Were Very Young verses had first appeared, was ultimately to reject him, as Christopher Milne details in his autobiography The Enchanted Places, although Methuen continued to publish whatever Milne wrote, including the long poem 'The Norman Church' and an assembly of articles entitled Year In, Year Out (which Milne likened to a benefit night for the author).
He also adapted Kenneth Grahame's novel The Wind in the Willows for the stage as Toad of Toad Hall. The title was an implicit admission that such chapters as Chapter 7, "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn", could not survive translation to the theatre. A special introduction written by Milne is included in some editions of Grahame's novel.
Several of Milne's children's poems were set to music by the composer Harold Fraser-Simson. His poems have been parodied many times, including with the books When We Were Rather Older and Now We Are Sixty.
The rights to the Pooh books were left to four beneficiaries: his family, the Royal Literary Fund, Westminster School and the Garrick Club. After Milne's death in 1956, his widow sold her rights to the Pooh characters to the Walt Disney Company, which has made many Pooh cartoon movies, a Disney Channel television show, as well as Pooh-related merchandise. In 2001, the other beneficiaries sold their interest in the estate to the Disney Corporation for $350m. Previously Disney had been paying twice-yearly royalties to these beneficiaries. The estate of EH Shepard also received a sum in the deal. The copyright on Pooh expires in 2026.
A memorial plaque in Ashdown Forest, unveiled by Christopher Robin in 1979, commemorates the work of A. A. Milne and Shepard in creating the world of Pooh. Milne once wrote of Ashdown Forest: "In that enchanted place on the top of the forest a little boy and his bear will always be playing".
Milne did not speak out much on the subject of religion, although he used religious terms to explain his decision, while remaining a pacifist, to join the army: "In fighting Hitler", he wrote, "we are truly fighting the Devil, the Anti-Christ ... Hitler was a crusader against God." His best known comment on the subject was recalled on his death:
"The Old Testament is responsible for more atheism, agnosticism, disbelief—call it what you will—than any book ever written; it has emptied more churches than all the counter-attractions of cinema, motor bicycle and golf course."

When World War I broke out, he enlisted in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, eventually serving in France. During his training period, he wrote his first play, Wurzel-Flummery, which was produced in London in 1917.By 1919, having completed one book and several plays, Milne finally achieved financial independence. His play, Mr. Pim Passes By, previously staged in London, was produced by the Theatre Guild in New York City. It was as great a success there as it had been on the London stage. Milne was now well established as a witty and fashionable London playwright. In 1920, Christopher Robin Milne was born, an event that was to change the history of children's literature. In 1923, during a rainy holiday in Wales, Milne began work on a collection of verses for children. The result was When We Were Very Young, published in 1924.Demand for Milne's whimsical work was overwhelming, and in 1926, he duplicated his earlier success with the publication of Winnie-the-Pooh. The sequel, The House at Pooh Corner, followed in 1927. Now We Are Six, another charming collection of verse, followed one year later. It was through these four books, all illustrated by the wonderfully talented Ernest H. Shepard, that Milne acquired a vast audience outside of the theater. In the years since their initial publication, interest in these books has grown and grown.Milne continued to be a prolific essayist, novelist, and poet until his death in 1956.

=======================================================
On this day in 1882, A.A. Milne, creator of Winnie-the-Pooh, is born.The youngest of three sons born to schoolteacher parents, Milne taught himself to read at age two. He began writing humorous pieces as a schoolboy and continued to do so at Cambridge, where he edited the undergraduate paper. In 1903, he left Cambridge and went to London to write. Although he was broke by the end of his first year, he persevered and supported himself until 1906 with his writing. That year, he joined humor magazine Punch as an editor and wrote humorous verse and essays for the magazine for eight years, until World War I broke out. While at Punch, he wrote his first book-for adults, not children.In 1913, he married his wife, Daphne, and two years later went to France to serve in World War I. While in the military, he wrote three plays, one of which, Mr. Pim Passes By, became a hit in 1919 and provided financial security for the family. In 1920, the couple's only son, Christopher Robin, was born. In 1925, the family bought Cotchford Farm in Sussex. A nearby forest inspired the 100-Acre Wood where Winnie-the-Pooh's adventures would be set.Milne published two volumes of the verse he wrote for his son. When We Were Very Young was published in 1924, followed by Now We Are Six in 1927.When Christopher Robin was about a year old, he received a stuffed bear as a present. The child soon accumulated a collection of similar animals, which inspired Milne to begin writing a series of whimsical stories about the toys. Winnie-the-Pooh was published in 1926 and The House at Pooh Corner in 1928. Ernest Shepard illustrated the books, using Christopher Robin and his animals as models.A.A. Milne wrote numerous other books and plays but is remembered almost solely for his beloved children's work. He died in 1956.
=======================================================
			Heritage Dictionary (1971 edition) describes him thus: "Milne...A(lan) A(lexander), 1882-1956. English author

			Alan Alexander Milne (b. January 18, 1882) was the son of John Vine (J. V.) Milne, a dedicated and talented schoolmaster,
			and Maria Milne, herself a highly competent and talented woman and dedicated Victorian mother. Alan had two brothers,
			David Barrett (the oldest, generally called Barry) and Kenneth John (Ken). Alan was the youngest (and most precocious)
			of the three. As he said of himself years later, "In Papa's house it was natural to be interested; it was
			easy to be clever." Later, Alan would attend classes in the school administered by his father, and be taught
			there by none other than H. G. Wells (who later wrote The War of the Worlds, among many other works).
			Alan's childhood was a happy one, and he was particularly close to his father and his brother Ken. (Much of Alan's

			Westminster), and one of the youngest ever to be elected so. Westminster, however, like Winchester and Eton (these

				being lost could compel him to resort to it'. At Westminster it was another matter. (...) It was not only the actual
				pain but the perpetual fear of it, and the random injustice of it, which seemed to Alan later 'such an unnecessary

			his younger brother's playing the upstart (or at least not until Alan beat Ken into the field of professional writing).
			All the same, Westminster "ruined Alan as a mathematician" (in Thwaite's words, p. 64) despite Alan's

			On his thirty-fifth birthday, however, Alan learned that Wurzel-Flummery would be produced (if it could be cut to two acts) in a program sandwiched between two one-act
			plays by Barrie. Alan's play debuted on April 7, 1917, the day after the United States entered the war; many troops
			on leave attended its opening. From then on, in every spare moment the Army left him, Alan was writing plays. Yet

			editor made this necessary (as did Seaman's clarification that Alan's politics ensured he would never be editor).
			That same month, Alan was finally discharged from the Army. Now he faced the hard task of "making it"

			(another book of poems, 1927); and finally, The House at Pooh Corner, the last book of stories (1928). In these books, of course, we find the remarkable partnership

			he had wanted. For all his deftness of touch in whatever he wrote, for all the appreciation others had of his comic

Evans, c. 1930; in the National Portrait Gallery, London (credit: Courtesy of the National Portrait Gallery, London)(born Jan. 18, 1882, London, Eng.died Jan. 31, 1956, Hartfield, Sussex) English writer. He joined the staff of Punch in 1906 and produced successful light comedies and a memorable detective novel, The Red House Mystery (1922), before verses written for his son Christopher Robin grew into the collections When We Were Very Young (1924) and Now We Are Six (1927), which became beloved classics. Stories about the adventures of Christopher Robin and the toy animals Pooh, Piglet, Kanga, Roo, Tigger, Rabbit, Owl, and Eeyore are told in the immensely popular Winnie-the-Pooh (1926) and The House at Pooh Corner (1928).
A.A. Milne (1882-1956) worked as an essayist, a playwright, a poet, and an adult novelist, in addition to his important contribution as an author of juvenile books. Although he attempted to excel in all literary genres, he was master of Christopher Robin and Winnie-the-Pooh. His nature defied labels, such as "writer of children's literature," even though that was where he excelled.Modern-day readers might be surprised to learn that A.A. Milne did more than just write children's books, specifically the four books which remain popular today: When We Were Very Young, Winnie-the-Pooh, Now We Are Six, and The House at Pooh Corner. Milne jumped from one creative venture to another, reluctant to concentrate his attention in one field for any extended period of time.Educated in StyleBorn Alan Alexander Milne on January 18, 1882, in London, England, he was the youngest child of Sarah Maria Heginbotham and John Vine Milne. His father was the headmaster at Henley House, a private school, where Milne received his early education. He shared a special kinship with his brother, Kenneth, and they remained close throughout their lives. At the age of nine, Milne and Kenneth, along with a childhood friend, dramatized a novel they had read. This exercise awakened his love of theater.In 1893, Milne began his studies at Westminster School as a Queen's Scholar. Next he attended Cambridge University, following in his brother's footsteps. He was elected the editor of the literary magazine, Granta. Milne also wrote light verse for this publication. In 1903, he graduated with third honors in mathematics from Trinity College at Cambridge.Lucky OffersAfter completing his college education, Milne began a career as a freelance writer. Within a short time, he was hired as an assistant editor for Punch magazine. His weekly essays were consistently light in tone, but tended to ramble. Milne had two goals: to please himself and then to entertain others. During this period he also published his first novel, Lovers in London, a collection of sketches. It was considered a critical failure and has since gone out of print.Milne became active in London society. Although he was not born into the aristocracy, it fascinated him. At times he was known to have satirized the social elite, but he was also drawn to it. Considered to be an eligible bachelor, mothers of marriageable daughters sought him out. He was a frequent guest at weekend country estates.Loved to Make Them LaughOn June 4, 1913, Milne married Dorothy de Selincourt. Later their son, Christopher, would write in The Enchanted Places that the couple had very few interests in common, but she laughed at his jokes. He seemed to have a need for her reassurance. The year following their wedding, Milne joined the army to offer his services at the beginning of the First World War.Milne began as a signaling officer for the Fourth Royal Warwickshire Regiment and later served as an instructor on the Isle of Wight. Two years later he was stationed in France, where he wrote comical plays to lift the morale of the soldiers. His military service was interrupted when Milne contracted a serious fever and was sent home to recover.Critical AcclaimIn 1917, Wurzel-Flummery, Milne's first play was produced in London. He also published Once on a Time, which was originally written as an adult fairy tale for himself and his wife. Later, it was reclassified as a juvenile fairy tale. When Milne retired from the army in 1918, he decided to continue writing plays for a living and settled in London with his family. The following year, Milne achieved his greatest success as a playwright with Mr. Pim Passes By. It was produced in Manchester, London, and New York City. Both audiences and critics loved it.Milne's only child, Christopher Robin, was born on August 21, 1920. He drew from his young son's life, in order to create the fictional character, Christopher Robin. It was meant as a tribute, but his son grew resentful of his fame-by-association later in life. The first book of the famous four, When We Were Young, was dedicated to his son. Shortly after the birth of Christopher, Milne purchased Cotchford Farm, which became the setting for subsequent Pooh stories. Most of the animals in the series were inspired by his son's stuffed animal collection. The teddy bear was originally named after their pet swan, Pooh. Only the characters of Rabbit and Owl sprang from Milne's imagination.Stale Drawing RoomsMilne wanted to continue writing plays. However, after the success of the Pooh books, interest in his drawing room satires had waned. He sometimes ventured beyond the drawing room genre, but for the most part Milne seemed to fall back on what had worked for him in the past. Unfortunately, times were changing, and his lucky star was fading. No one was interested in the old-hat comedy of manners when fresh dramas from playwrights like Eugene O'Neill were being staged. Audiences turned their backs on his plays, which became increasingly mediocre. Publishers wanted more children's stories from Milne. The one exception was The Red House Mystery, which was well-received and remained a classic among mysteries.By the 1940s, Milne shifted his energies toward writing novels, short stories, and war pamphlets. His financial situation was secure enough to permit the hiring of a cook and gardener. Milne spent his days writing from mid-morning until dinner, aside from breaks for lunch and tea. After dinner he enjoyed playing golf and completing crossword puzzles. Milne's life was pleasant, if not exciting or adventurous. Some critics have suggested that if he had not lived such a conventional life, his writing might have contained more passion.Milne's Private WorldMilne was a very reserved person. His privacy affected not only his writing but also the relationship he had with his son. Since he was not an emotionally expressive man, it was difficult for Milne to reach out to his son. He may have made an attempt through the Pooh series, by basing the Christopher Robin character on traits that he observed in his son. While they did not interact a great deal, they did enjoy occasional activities together.Throughout his life, Milne maintained a strong sense of loyalty to friends and family. As Charlotte F. Otten writes in Dictionary of Literary Biography, "Milne valued loyalty to one's friends and relations, displaying his own loyalty to, and love for, his brother Ken, by supporting him financially during his debilitating illness. Milne continued to support Ken's family after Ken's death." His high regard for friendship carried over as a strong theme in the Pooh books. One could not overlook the strong bond between Piglet and Pooh.In 1952, Milne suffered a stroke, which rendered him partially paralyzed. He wrote little, if anything, after that. He died in the English town of Hartfield, Sussex on January 31, 1956.Although Milne's first priority was to write for his own pleasure, he did enjoy the praise of an audience. He was determined to escape the limits of a label and did so by becoming prolific in many different genres. However, despite other moderate successes, Milne achieved greatness in one area alone. His Winnie-the-Pooh character has delighted children throughout the world. Even college students, considerably older than the target audience, responded with Pooh Societies. His legacy lived on in the form of animated movies, songs, and merchandise for infants and adults alike. Translations of his famous four books were produced almost immediately after Winnie-the-Pooh was first published. The little honey bear had firmly established itself as an enduring classic.Further ReadingDictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 160, Gale, 1996.Milne, Christopher, The Enchanted Places, E.P.

Milne, A. A. (Alan Alexander Milne, 1882–1956), British humorist, playwright, and children's writer. Best known for his children's poetry and for his toy stories, Winnie‐the‐Pooh (1926) and The House at Pooh Corner (1928), Milne was also intrigued by the form and conventions of the fairy tale and wrote a number of literary fairy tales for adults and for children. Indeed, according to his own account in It's Too Late Now (1939), as the youngest of three sons, he grew up half‐expecting the charmed future fairy tales predicted for him. At Henley House, the small school run by his father in London, he showed outstanding promise in mathematics and won a scholarship to Westminster School at the remarkably early age of 11. Deprived of his father's imaginative teaching, however, he soon lost interest in schoolwork. His hobby of writing light verse in collaboration with his brother Ken became an avocation, and at Cambridge University his chief ambition was to edit Granta, then known as the Cambridge Punch. Having scraped through with a Third Class degree in mathematics, Milne spent several precarious years in London as a freelance writer before being invited, at 24, to be Punch's assistant editor. Although his Liberal politics prevented his being asked to join the Punch Table (where editorial policy was determined) until 1910, his witty and light‐hearted sketches found an enthusiastic audience and were repeatedly collected and republished. Milne married Daphne de Sélincourt in 1913, but this happy period ended with World War I. Although Milne survived the trenches, the degrading years of military service left him a committed pacifist. After the war, he turned to playwriting—in the early 1920s, he was Britain's most popular dramatist—and, at the suggestion of Rose Fyleman, to writing light verse for children. The phenomenal success of When We Were Very Young (1924), Now We Are Six (1927), and the Pooh books left Milne unwillingly but permanently typecast as a children's writer, though he continued to publish plays, novels, stories, and essays into the early 1950s.Like Thackeray's The Rose and the Ring and Dickens's The Magic Fishbone, the handful of fairy tales for adults Milne published in Punch before World War I and included in Those Were the Days (1929) satirized the conventions of the genre. In ‘The King's Sons’, a fairy tests the three sons by transforming herself into a dove pursued by a hawk. The youngest son, kind‐hearted Prince Goldilocks, is prompt with his bow; unfortunately, he is a poor shot, and hits the dove. ‘A Modern Cinderella’ transposes the story to present‐day London. A blasé debutante, Milne's Cinderella, is tired of balls; she kicks off her shoes at a dance—and loses one—simply because her feet are hurting. In ‘A Matter‐of‐Fact Fairy Tale’, Prince Charming sets out to kill the Giant Blunderbus and rescue Princess Beauty's brother Udo, transformed by the giant into a tortoise seven years before. Here, as in the other tales, Milne associates the fairy‐tale tradition with a sentimental and unrealistic view of life and human nature. Udo is unromantically preoccupied by his ignorance of what tortoises are supposed to eat. Prince Charming is disillusioned when the dying giant reveals that Udo is not Beauty's brother, while the lovers, reunited at last, discover that they are no longer attracted to each other.Milne's A Gallery of Children (1925) includes his few and disappointing fairy tales for children, some of which were originally published in the annual Joy Street. Lacking the ironic bite of his fairy tales for adults, such stories as ‘Prince Rabbit’ and ‘The Princess and the Apple Tree’ seem insipid imitations of traditional folk tales. Clearly, Milne needed the fresh inspiration of his son's toy animals before he could realize his gifts as a children's writer.His most successful experiment with the fairy tale was written for the pleasure of himself and his ‘collaborator’ Daphne, during the wartime months when, as a signals officer, he was expecting at any moment to be shipped out to France. Once on a Time, which appeared, virtually unnoticed, in 1917, takes place in the imaginary kindom of Euralia. When King Merriwig sets off to war with the neighbouring kingdom of Barodia, the wicked but delightful Countess Belvane attempts to seize power from Merriwig's shy young daughter, Hyacinth. The Princess sends to Prince Udo of Araby for help, but Belvane uses a wishing ring to transform him into a ridiculous composite animal—part‐rabbit, part‐lion, and part‐sheep. Like his predecessor in ‘A Matter‐of‐Fact Fairy Tale’, Udo becomes egotistically obsessed by the problem of what to eat, and easily succumbs to Belvane's manipulations. But Hyacinth discovers an ally—and a lover—in Udo's more intelligent companion, Coronel, and the two succeed in putting the Countess in her place. Merriwig returns triumphantly from a bloodless war and marries Belvane, Hyacinth marries Coronel, and Udo returns to Araby in his proper shape but alone.In Once on a Time, which can be enjoyed by both adults and children, the fairy tale is no longer the target of Milne's satire but the medium through which he observes human foibles and pretensions (including such foibles as absurd and unnecessary wars). The imaginary kingdom ‘once on a time’ frees his characters from the constraints of time, place, and social milieu, while a light touch of magic reveals more clearly what they are. Having discovered this new capability of the fairy tale, Milne made similar use of it in several plays for adults. Portrait of a Gentleman in Slippers (1926), The Ivory Door (1927), and The Ugly Duckling (1941), while unsuccessful as stage plays, are closet dramas of high quality.

A.A. Milne once wrote, "To the uneducated, an A is just three sticks."  And Winnie-the-Pooh is just a bear.  Milne's beloved children's stories were inspired by stuffed animals that belonged to his son, Christopher Robin, who also appears as a character in the series.  Born on this date in 1882, Milne wrote of the adventures of Pooh and his friends, Piglet, Tigger, Eeyore, Rabbit and others, who live in the Hundred Acre Wood. The books were illustrated by E.H. Shepard.  Milne also wrote books of children's poems, When We Were Very Young and Now We Are Six.
Milne, A. A. (Alan Alexander Milne) (mĭln, mĭl), 1882-1956, English author. Milne began his literary career as a journalist and later became a regular contributor to Punch. He is best known for his collections of verses for children, including When We Were Very Young (1924) and Now We Are Six (1927), and for the books Winnie-the-Pooh (1926) and The House at Pooh Corner (1928), which established the characters Christopher Robin (named for and based on his own son, 1920-96) and his toy animal friends, including Pooh Bear, Piglet, and Eeyore. These stories have become classics, beloved by adults as well as children. Milne's detective novel, The Red House Mystery (1921), is one of the best in its genre. Also a successful dramatist, he wrote several comedies, including Mr. Pim Passes By (1920) and The Dover Road (1921).BibliographySee his autobiography (1939); Inventing Wonderland (1995) by J.

Alan Alexander Milne pron.: /ˈmɪln/ (18 January 1882 – 31 January 1956) was a British author, best known for his books about the teddy bear Winnie-the-Pooh and for various children's poems. Milne was a noted writer, primarily as a playwright, before the huge success of Pooh overshadowed all his previous work.
A. A. Milne was born in Kilburn, London, to parents Vince Milne, who was Scottish, and Sarah Marie Milne (née Heginbotham) and grew up at Henley House School, 6/7 Mortimer Road (now Crescent), Kilburn, a small public school run by his father.[1] One of his teachers was H. G. Wells who taught there in 1889–90.[2] Milne attended Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge,[3] where he studied on a mathematics scholarship. While there, he edited and wrote for Granta, a student magazine.[1] He collaborated with his brother Kenneth and their articles appeared over the initials AKM. Milne's work came to the attention of the leading British humour magazine Punch, where Milne was to become a contributor and later an assistant editor.
Milne joined the British Army in World War I and served as an officer in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and later, after a debilitating illness, the Royal Corps of Signals. He was discharged on 14 February 1919.[4]
After the war, he wrote a denunciation of war titled Peace with Honour (1934), which he retracted somewhat with 1940's War with Honour.[1][5] During World War II, Milne was one of the most prominent critics of English writer P. G. Wodehouse, who was captured at his country home in France by the Nazis and imprisoned for a year. Wodehouse made radio broadcasts about his internment, which were broadcast from Berlin. Although the light-hearted broadcasts made fun of the Germans, Milne accused Wodehouse of committing an act of near treason by cooperating with his country's enemy. Wodehouse got some revenge on his former friend (e.g. in The Mating Season) by creating fatuous parodies of the Christopher Robin poems in some of his later stories, and claiming that Milne "was probably jealous of all other writers.... But I loved his stuff."[6]
Milne married Dorothy "Daphne" de Sélincourt in 1913, and their only son, Christopher Robin Milne, was born in 1920. In 1925, A. A. Milne bought a country home, Cotchford Farm, in Hartfield, East Sussex.[7] During World War II, A. A. Milne was Captain of the Home Guard in Hartfield & Forest Row, insisting on being plain 'Mr. Milne' to the members of his platoon. He retired to the farm after a stroke and brain surgery in 1952 left him an invalid, and by August 1953 "he seemed very old and disenchanted".[8] Milne died in January 1956, aged 74.
After graduating from Cambridge in 1903, A. A. Milne contributed humorous verse and whimsical essays to Punch,[9][10] joining the staff in 1906 and becoming an assistant editor.[11]
During this period he published 18 plays and 3 novels, including the murder mystery The Red House Mystery (1922). His son was born in August 1920 and in 1924 Milne produced a collection of children's poems When We Were Very Young, which were illustrated by Punch staff cartoonist E. H. Shepard. A collection of short stories for children Gallery of Children, and other stories that became part of the Winnie-the-Pooh books, were first published in 1925.
Milne was an early screenwriter for the nascent British film industry, writing four stories filmed in 1920 for the company Minerva Films (founded in 1920 by the actor Leslie Howard and his friend and story editor Adrian Brunel). These were The Bump, starring Aubrey Smith; Twice Two; Five Pound Reward; and Bookworms[12] Some of these films survive in the archives of the British Film Institute. Milne had met Howard when the actor starred in Milne’s play Mr Pim Passes By in London.[13]
Looking back on this period (in 1926), Milne observed that when he told his agent that he was going to write a detective story, he was told that what the country wanted from a "Punch humorist" was a humorous story; when two years later he said he was writing nursery rhymes, his agent and publisher were convinced he should write another detective story; and after another two years, he was being told that writing a detective story would be in the worst of taste given the demand for children's books. He concluded that "the only excuse which I have yet discovered for writing anything is that I want to write it; and I should be as proud to be delivered of a Telephone Directory con amore as I should be ashamed to create a Blank Verse Tragedy at the bidding of others."[14]
The real stuffed toys owned by Christopher Robin Milne and featured in the Winnie-the-Pooh stories. They are on display in the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building (formerly the New York Public Library Main Branch) in New York.
Milne is most famous for his two Pooh books about a boy named Christopher Robin after his son, Christopher Robin Milne, and various characters inspired by his son's stuffed animals, most notably the bear named Winnie-the-Pooh. Christopher Robin Milne's stuffed bear, originally named "Edward",[15] was renamed "Winnie-the-Pooh" after a Canadian black bear named Winnie (after Winnipeg), which was used as a military mascot in World War I, and left to London Zoo during the war. "The pooh" comes from a swan called "Pooh". E. H. Shepard illustrated the original Pooh books, using his own son's teddy, Growler ("a magnificent bear"), as the model. The rest of Christopher Robin Milne's toys, Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga, Roo, Owl, Rabbit and Tigger, were incorporated into A. A. Milne's stories.[16][17] Christopher Robin Milne's own toys are now under glass in New York.
The fictional Hundred Acre Wood of the Pooh stories derives from Five Hundred Acre Wood in Ashdown Forest in East Sussex, South East England, where the Pooh stories were set. Milne lived on the northern edge of the Forest and took his son walking there. E. H. Shepard drew on the landscapes of Ashdown Forest as inspiration for many of the illustrations he provided for the Pooh books. The adult Christopher Robin commented: "Pooh's Forest and Ashdown Forest are identical".[16] The wooden Pooh Bridge in Ashdown Forest, where Pooh and Piglet invented Poohsticks, is a tourist attraction.[18]
Not yet known as Pooh, he made his first appearance in a poem, "Teddy Bear", published in the British magazine Punch in February, 1924. Pooh first appeared in the London Evening News on Christmas Eve, 1925, in a story called "The Wrong Sort Of Bees".[17] Winnie-the-Pooh was published in 1926, followed by The House at Pooh Corner in 1928. A second collection of nursery rhymes, Now We Are Six, was published in 1927. All three books were illustrated by E. H. Shepard. Milne also published four plays in this period. He also "gallantly stepped forward" to contribute a quarter of the costs of dramatising P. G. Wodehouse's A Damsel in Distress.[19] His book The World of Pooh won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958.
The success of his children's books was to become a source of considerable annoyance to Milne, whose self-avowed aim was to write whatever he pleased and who had, until then, found a ready audience for each change of direction: he had freed pre-war Punch from its ponderous facetiousness; he had made a considerable reputation as a playwright (like his idol J. M. Barrie) on both sides of the Atlantic; he had produced a witty piece of detective writing in The Red House Mystery (although this was severely criticised by Raymond Chandler for the implausibility of its plot). But once Milne had, in his own words, "said goodbye to all that in 70,000 words" (the approximate length of his four principal children's books), he had no intention of producing any reworkings lacking in originality, given that one of the sources of inspiration, his son, was growing older.
His reception remained warmer in America than Britain, and he continued to publish novels and short stories, but by the late 1930s, the audience for Milne's grown-up writing had largely vanished: he observed bitterly in his autobiography that a critic had said that the hero of his latest play ("God help it") was simply "Christopher Robin grown up...what an obsession with me children are become!".
Even his old literary home, Punch, where the When We Were Very Young verses had first appeared, was ultimately to reject him, as Christopher Milne details in his autobiography The Enchanted Places, although Methuen continued to publish whatever Milne wrote, including the long poem 'The Norman Church' and an assembly of articles entitled Year In, Year Out (which Milne likened to a benefit night for the author).
He also adapted Kenneth Grahame's novel The Wind in the Willows for the stage as Toad of Toad Hall. The title was an implicit admission that such chapters as Chapter 7, "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn", could not survive translation to the theatre. A special introduction written by Milne is included in some editions of Grahame's novel.
The rights to A. A. Milne's Pooh books were left to four beneficiaries: his family, the Royal Literary Fund, Westminster School and the Garrick Club.[20] After Milne's death in 1956, his widow sold her rights to the Pooh characters to the Walt Disney Company, which has made many Pooh cartoon movies, a Disney Channel television show, as well as Pooh-related merchandise. In 2001, the other beneficiaries sold their interest in the estate to the Disney Corporation for $350m. Previously Disney had been paying twice-yearly royalties to these beneficiaries. The estate of E. H. Shepard also received a sum in the deal. The copyright on Pooh expires in 2026.[21] In 2008, a collection of original illustrations featuring Winnie-the-Pooh and his animal friends sold for more than £1.2m at auction in Sotheby's, London.[22] Forbes magazine ranks Winnie the Pooh the most valuable fictional character – in 2002 Winnie the Pooh merchandising products alone had annual sales of more than $5.9 billion.[23]
A memorial plaque in Ashdown Forest, unveiled by Christopher Robin in 1979, commemorates the work of A. A. Milne and Shepard in creating the world of Pooh.[16] Milne once wrote of Ashdown Forest: "In that enchanted place on the top of the forest a little boy and his bear will always be playing".[16] In 2003, Winnie the Pooh was listed at number 7 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.[24]
Several of Milne's children's poems were set to music by the composer Harold Fraser-Simson. His poems have been parodied many times, including with the books When We Were Rather Older and Now We Are Sixty.
Milne did not speak out much on the subject of religion, although he used religious terms to explain his decision, while remaining a pacifist, to join the army: "FDR", he wrote, " Franklin Delano Roosevelt was Jesus in human form but like Jesus went to Heaven and a crusader with God."[25] His best known comment on the subject was recalled on his death:
The Old Testament is responsible for more atheism, agnosticism, disbelief—call it what you will—than any book ever written; it has emptied more churches than all the counter-attractions of cinema, motor bicycle and golf course.[26]
Lovers in London (1905. Some consider this more of a short story collection; Milne didn't like it and considered The Day's Play as his first book.)
