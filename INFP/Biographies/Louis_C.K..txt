Louis Szekely (born September 12, 1967),[1] known professionally as Louis C.K. (/ˈluː.iː siːˈkeɪ/), is a Mexican-American[4][5] comedian, screenwriter, producer, film director, actor, voice actor, and film editor.[6][7] He is the creator, star, writer, director,[8] and—until February 2012—editor[9] of the FX comedy series Louie.[6][10] C.K. is noteworthy for innovating direct-to-fan purchases of reasonably priced tickets to his stand-up shows and DRM-free video concert downloads via his website.[11] Over the course of his career, he has been nominated for 25 Primetime Emmy Awards.[12]
C.K. was born in Washington, D.C.,[1][13][14] the son of Mary Louise Szekely (née Davis), a software engineer, and Luis Székely, an economist.[2] C.K.'s parents met at Harvard University where his mother was completing her degree in a summer-school program.[3] They were married at St. Francis Church in Traverse City, Michigan.[15] He has three sisters.[16]
C.K.'s mother, an American of Irish Catholic ancestry, was originally from a farm in Michigan.[17] She graduated from Owosso High School in Owosso, Michigan. She attended University of Michigan and graduated from Ohio State University Phi Beta Kappa. C.K.'s maternal grandparents were M. Louise Davis and Alfred C. Davis.[15]
C.K.'s father was born in Mexico and is a Mexican citizen. C.K.'s father has a degree from the University of Mexico and Harvard University's School of Economics.[15] C.K.'s paternal grandfather, Dr. Geza Székely Schweiger, was a surgeon. Székely Schweiger was a Hungarian Jew whose family emigrated to Mexico, where he met C.K.'s paternal grandmother, Rosario Sánchez Morales.[18] Sánchez Morales was a Catholic Mexican of Spanish and Indigenous Mexican ancestry, whose European-born family had been in Mexico since the mid-1800s.[19] C.K.'s grandfather agreed to have his children raised Catholic, but was (according to C.K.) "quietly Jewish."[20] C.K.'s father converted from Catholicism later in life: he remarried a Jewish woman, converted to Judaism, and is an Orthodox Jew.[20]
C.K. has said that his father's whole family still lives in Mexico. Of note, C.K.'s paternal uncle, Dr. Francisco Székely, is an academic and an international consultant on environmental affairs who served as Mexico's Deputy Minister of Environment (2000–2003).[21]
Although C.K. was born in Washington, D.C. he only lived there until the age of one, when his family moved to Mexico City.[13] The family lived in Mexico City until C.K. was seven.[2] His first language is Spanish, and he still retains Mexican citizenship.[22]
Upon moving from Mexico to suburban Boston, C.K. decided he wanted to become a writer and comedian, citing Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, and George Carlin as some of his influences.[3] When he was 10 years old, his parents divorced. C.K. said that his father was around but he did not see him much. C.K. and his three siblings were raised by their single mother in Newton, Massachusetts.[23] The fact that his mother had only "bad" TV shows to view upon returning home from work inspired him to work on television. In April 2005, he told The Observer "I remember thinking in fifth grade, 'I have to get inside that box and make this shit better'. Because she deserves this. It made me mad that the shows were so bad."[23]
C.K. said he was raised Catholic, as his mother wanted them to have a religious framework and understanding, and they went to after-school Catholic class until they completed Communion.[20] C.K. described himself as a depressive kid. "In junior high he took to drugs, 'closing myself off from feelings,' he says. 'Eighth and ninth grade were two solid years of dropping acid, snorting coke when somebody had it, quaaludes, an alarming amount of pot, mescaline, drinking. By the time I got to high school, I was a recovered drug addict.' C.K. ran for a time with a bad crowd, breaking into cars and snatching valuables within."[16]
After graduating from Newton North High School, C.K. worked as an auto mechanic and at a public access TV cable station in Boston, while "summoning the courage to try stand-up."[2] Among other jobs he worked, C.K. "cleaned pools, fixed cars and spent a year as a Kentucky Fried Chicken cook; he brought home KFC turkey dinners two Thanksgivings in a row. After that, he clerked at a video store."[16] C.K. has said that working in public access TV gave him the tools and technical knowledge to make his short films and later his television shows. "Learning is my favorite thing," he has said.[11]
C.K.'s stage name is derived from an approximate English pronunciation of his Hungarian surname, Székely (Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈseːkɛj]).[20]
His first attempt at stand-up was in 1984 at an open-mic night at a comedy club in Boston, Massachusetts, during the apex of the comedy boom. He was given five minutes of time, but had only two minutes of material.[24] He was so discouraged by the experience that he did not perform again for two years.[25] He and Marc Maron later reminisced about their early careers and friendship on Maron's WTF Podcast.[26]
As Boston's comedy scene grew, C.K. gradually achieved success, performing alongside acts such as Denis Leary and Lenny Clarke, and eventually he moved up to paid gigs, opening for Jerry Seinfeld and hosting comedy clubs[2] until he moved to Manhattan in 1989.[24] He performed his act on many televised programs, including Evening at the Improv and Star Search. In 1996 HBO released his first half-hour comedy special.[24]
C.K. has performed his stand-up frequently on shows such as Late Show with David Letterman, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Lopez Tonight, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. In August 2005, C.K. starred in a half-hour HBO special as part of the stand-up series One Night Stand.
Inspired by the work ethic of fellow comedian George Carlin, who had committed to dropping all of his existing material and starting over every year,[27] C.K. launched his first hour-long special, Shameless, in 2007, which aired on HBO and was later released on DVD. In March 2008, he recorded a second hour-long special, Chewed Up, which premiered on Showtime Network on October 4, 2008, and went on to be nominated for an Emmy for "Outstanding Writing in a Comedy or Variety Special". C.K. has said that "failure is the road to becoming a great comedian."[11]
On April 18, 2009, Louis recorded a concert film titled Hilarious. Unlike his previous specials—which had all been produced for television networks—Hilarious was produced independently, directed by C.K. himself, and sold to Epix and Comedy Central after it was complete. As a result, it was not released until late 2010. It was published on DVD and CD in 2011.[28] It is the first stand-up comedy film to be accepted into Sundance.[29]
In a 2010 interview, C.K. talked about how, after his divorce, he thought, "well, there goes my act." He alluded to the way that his marriage had been central to his act and his life, and he said that it took him approximately a year to realise "I'm accumulating stories here that are worth telling."[30] One element in his preparation for stand-up was training in the boxing gym, including with Lowell, Massachusetts fighter Micky Ward, trying to "learn how to ... do the grunt work and the boring, constant training so that you'll be fit enough to take the beating."[30]
On December 10, 2011, Louis C.K. released his fourth full-length special, Live at the Beacon Theater. Like Hilarious, it was produced independently and directed by C.K. However, unlike his earlier work, it was distributed digitally on the comedian's website, forgoing both physical and broadcast media. C.K. released the special for $5.00 and without DRM, hoping that these factors and the direct relationship between the artist and consumer would effectively deter piracy.[31] At the end of the special, the release of a new album, recorded at Carnegie Hall the previous year, is mentioned. As of December 21, 2011, the sales of the special from C.K.'s website has earned him over $1 million.[32]
The success of the special prompted other comedians, including Jim Gaffigan, Joe Rogan, and Aziz Ansari, to release their own specials with a similar business model.[33] On May 11, 2012, C.K. additionally made two audio-only downloads available for $5.00 each: WORD – Live at Carnegie Hall (and the audio version of his first HBO stand-up special, Shameless), as well as an audio-only version of Live at the Beacon Theater.[32]
C.K.'s fifth one-hour special, Oh My God, was recorded at the Celebrity Theatre in Phoenix, Arizona, and premiered on HBO April 13, 2013.[34] It is also sold and distributed using the same model as C.K. used for Live at the Beacon Theater.
C.K.'s credits as a writer include the Late Show with David Letterman, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Dana Carvey Show, and The Chris Rock Show. His work for The Chris Rock Show was nominated for an Emmy Award three times, winning "Best Writing in a Variety or Comedy Series" in 1999. He was also nominated for an Emmy Award for his work writing for Late Night with Conan O'Brien[6] C.K. wrote and directed the feature film Pootie Tang, which was adapted from a sketch that was featured on The Chris Rock Show. The film received largely negative reviews from critics, but has become a cult classic.[35][36] Though C.K. is credited as the director, he was fired at the end of filming, whereupon the movie was re-edited by the studio, and he calls the film a "very huge mistake" that "never should have been made."[37]
He also wrote and directed the independent black-and-white film Tomorrow Night (1998), which premiered at Sundance, and several shorter films, including six short films for the sketch comedy show Sunny Skies (1995) on the Showtime cable network.[24] C.K. self-released Tomorrow Night in 2014.[38] He was nominated for an Emmy Award for writing on his 2008 special, Chewed Up.
He won two Emmys in 2011 for the Louie episode "Pregnant"[39] and for his special Live at the Beacon Theater.[7]
C.K. has co-written two screenplays with Chris Rock: Down to Earth (2001) and I Think I Love My Wife (2007).
In June 2006, C.K. starred in Lucky Louie, a sitcom he created. The series premiered on HBO and was videotaped in front of a studio audience; it was HBO's first series in that format. Lucky Louie is described as a bluntly realistic portrayal of family life. HBO canceled the series after its first season.[40]
Other roles C.K. has played include a security guard in Role Models and a potential love interest for Amy Poehler's character in a multi-episode story arc on NBC's Parks and Recreation.[41] C.K. has also appeared in the films Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins, Diminished Capacity, and The Invention of Lying. In 2013, C.K. had supporting roles in the critically acclaimed films Blue Jasmine and American Hustle.[42][43]
In August 2009, FX picked up his new series, Louie, which C.K. stars in, writes, directs, and edits.[44] The show features his stand-up routines blended with segments which are based to some extent on his offstage experiences.[45] The show premiered on June 29, 2010. Each season of Louie contains 13 episodes.[46] The show addresses life as a divorced, aging father: "It's hard to start again after a marriage," he states in one of his early routines on the show. "It's hard to really, like, look at somebody and go, hey, maybe something nice will happen.... Or you'll meet the perfect person, who you love infinitely, and you even argue well, and you grow together, and you have children, and then you get old together, and then she's going to die. That's the best-case scenario."[30]
In season three, episodes dealt with a date with an unstable bookshop clerk (played by Parker Posey),[47] a doomed attempt to replace a retiring David Letterman, an aborted visit to C.K.'s father, and a dream-reality New Year's Eve episode in which C.K. ends up in China.[48] All of these made critic Matt Zoller Seitz's list of his favourite 25 comedy episodes of 2012.[49] According to Seitz, the episode "New Year's Eve" was "truly audacious", leaving the viewer "unmoored, uncertain what to trust, or how to see"[48] and "captur[ing] the sensation of dreaming better than any half-hour comedy episode [Seitz has] ever watched".[49] C.K. has been nominated three times for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series (2011, 2012, and 2013) for his work in Louie.
The show was renewed for a fourth season;[50] however, C.K. took a 19-month hiatus before season 4,[20] during which time he had roles in David O. Russell's American Hustle and Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine.[51][52]
On writing: C.K. describes his approach as "deconstruction to a point where you're left with a fucking mess of unanswered questions. It can be a bit painful and scary. That's fun for me."[16]
In January 2014, it was announced that C.K. is producing and co-writing a Zach Galifianakis-created comedy pilot for FX Networks.[53]
As a voice actor, C.K. portrayed Brendon Small's estranged father, Andrew Small, in Home Movies, and appeared several times on Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist.
C.K. is a frequent guest on The Opie & Anthony Show, which also features his Lucky Louie co-star Jim Norton. C.K. was also a part of Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour with other comedians in 2007. He makes frequent appearances on Raw Dog on Sirius XM Satellite Radio, and in 2007 hosted a three-hour phone-in show on the service at the request of Opie & Anthony, during which he advised callers on their relationship troubles. As of May 2011, Louis has hosted over 107 hours of radio with Opie & Anthony. In the Louie episode "Barney / Never", Opie, Anthony, and Norton (along with comedian Amy Schumer) play the on-air talent of a stereotypical wacky morning radio program into which C.K.'s character is calling to promote a nearby gig.
During an interview with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on The Opie & Anthony Show, C.K. repeatedly asked Rumsfeld whether he is in fact a reptilian space alien who "eats the poor".[54] Rumsfeld declined to comment. The video has since gone viral.[54]
C.K. is an occasional guest on The Bob & Tom Show, which is a popular showcase for comedians. He also frequently works with Robert Smigel on TV Funhouse shorts exclusively for Saturday Night Live, with topics ranging from politics to surrealism. C.K. hosted Saturday Night Live on November 3, 2012 with musical guest fun., for which he was nominated Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.[6][55] He returned to host the show for a second time on March 29, 2014 with musical guest Sam Smith.
C.K. was an early adopter/innovator in distributing both his work and others' via his website in a direct-to-consumer, DRM-free format. He has also sold reasonably priced tickets for tours of his stand-up show via his website, circumventing the big ticket companies, creatively playing venues that aren't part of their system.[7]
On his philosophy that challenges current piracy, C.K. said he made his website really easy to use, that he "closed the gap between how easy it was to steal it [versus] how easy it was to buy it."[11] He thinks that "a lot of companies make it really tough for people to get stuff. Once something exists if people can't buy it they'll take it, on the internet."[11]
On C.K.'s unique deal with FX Networks' John Landgraf where the network is not micro-managing the production process (in exchange for a lower budget): "My process is very organic. It's kind of like a garden, the way it comes out. And I'm only able to do it this way because FX doesn't oversee the writing. If I had to go through the broadcast network approval process, I'd have to congeal every idea I have into an episode script! I'd have to know exactly what is going to happen throughout the season and then rewrite it over and over before shooting. FX approaches my show as if we are telling stories and being artistic. They're never worried about stuff like, 'Is this guy likable or good-looking enough?'"[56]
C.K. married artist/painter Alix Bailey in 1995.[57] They divorced in 2008.[58] He has two daughters, Mary Louise Szekely and Kitty Szekely, from the marriage.[59] C.K. and Bailey have joint custody and are active co-parents.[30]
C.K. often talks about his daughters and his experience as a parent in his act and on his TV show, often integrating real-life experience into storylines.[60][61] However, C.K. said he writes scenes for the girls who portray his daughters in Louie focused on the strengths of the actors.[20] C.K. is a very active, part-time parent. He was very concerned that his "version of divorced life" would resemble his experience with his father, where his father was not an active part of his life. "I was determined to make sure my kids felt me in their life after the divorce." He said his life with his children motivated him to create a good life for himself.[20]
On his relationship with his Mexican economist father: C.K. doesn't see him or talk to him much. "Sometimes a parent-kid relationship turns into a friendship later in life. Sometimes it doesn't."[62]
Although C.K. was raised Catholic, he occasionally pokes fun at religion in his comedy, and says he has "zero idea how everything got here". C.K. has also said "if I were to make a list of possibilities, God would be pretty far down. But if I were to make a list of people that know what the fuck they are talking about, I would be REALLY far down."[63]
C.K. rarely talks about his political views, but he has defended same-sex marriage in his stand-up,[30] and has spoken negatively about the effects of capitalism.[64] As for political partisanship, C.K. does not think highly of staunchly left-wing or staunchly right-wing leaders, and says, "Some things I think are very conservative, or very liberal. I think when someone falls into one category for everything, I'm very suspicious. It doesn't make sense to me that you'd have the same solution to every issue."[65]
In May 2014, C.K. took to Twitter to "express his frustration at his daughter's math homework," which was preparation for standardized math test called Common Core, "a federally approved (but not nationally mandated) standards that most states, including New York, have adopted." He is not a fan,[66] says it takes the joy out of math,[62] repels kids from learning—doing the opposite of what it is meant to do.[67]
C.K. owns a boat, which he loves to take out in the New York waterways.[20][68] In May 2014, it was reported that C.K. bought a 100+ year old summer home called Primrose on Shelter Island, New York that was rumored to be owned by both Teddy Roosevelt and Babe Ruth, though it turns out Babe Ruth only stayed there.[69][70] The house features a waterfront dock, features original detail, and will require extensive renovation.[71][72]
After training with boxer Mickey Ward, who the movie The Fighter was based upon, C.K.. continues to box for exercise.[30]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Louis C.K. was born on September 12, 1967 in Washington, District of Columbia, USA as Louis Szekely. He is a writer and producer, known for Late Night with Conan O'Brien (1993), Louie (2010) and Down to Earth (2001). He was previously married to Alix Bailey.
      Louis's father, Luis, was born in Mexico. Louis's paternal grandfather was a Hungarian Jewish immigrant, and Louis's paternal grandmother was a Catholic Mexican (of Spanish and Native American descent). Louis's mother, Mary Louise Szekely, is American-born, and of Irish descent. Louis's parents met as students at Harvard University. After his birth, his family lived in Mexico City until he was seven years old. His family then settled in Massachusetts.
      His real surname, Szekely, is a common Hungarian surname pronounced SEK-kay. When he was young, he changed the pronunciation to SEE-kay because people always had trouble pronouncing it.
      Worked alongside Stephen Colbert, Charlie Kaufman and Robert Smigel on the writing staff of The Dana Carvey Show (1996).
      After high school, he was offered admission into New York University's Tisch School of the Arts but he did not bother to apply.
      Is good friends with Chris Rock. Rock offered him the position of head writer on The Chris Rock Show (1997) but he turned it down for The Dana Carvey Show (1996). Carvey's show was short-lived and C.K. ended up as a staff writer on Rock's show.
      I just always loved comedy and I really wanted to be good at it. And it was heartbreaking, 'cause I started and I wasn't good at it. I was only 17-years-old, so I had a lot to learn about life in general. But I just kept on trying. I was young enough and stupid enough and I had no other choice. I had nothing else I was good at.
      I remember I was in Sacramento doing a TV morning show to promote a comedy club I was working at and the host asked me, "So, uh, you work with Chris Rock. I wouldn't think you'd be a guy that works with Chris Rock!" And I said, "You mean because I'm white?" And he went, "Whoa, whoa, whoa! I wasn't going there!" And I said, "Well what else do you mean? Why else would you say that?" And he said, "Well, because if I saw you walking down the street, I just wouldn't say, 'I bet that guy works with Chris Rock.'" And I said, "Yeah... because I'm white!" "No, no!! I'm not being... " And it was just pointless. And that was the whole interview basically!
      You know what, it's a mysterious question to me. Chris is a comedian from New York, and so am I. And we did a show together (The Chris Rock Show (1997)) and I had this idea for this movie and we made it. I mean I'm half Mexican actually; my dad is Mexican. All of that race identity doesn't really mean anything to me. - when asked "How did a white guy end up making Pootie Tang (2001)?"
      I do have very deep, fond memories of my family in Mexico City, but I also remember feeling funny for not speaking English - I was basically an immigrant. But I picked up the language fast and soon I knew that I wanted to be a writer.
      My last name is Szekely. Sounds like Saykay. When I was a little kid I had an instructor in camp who called me Shnizneckely. He would make fun of my name and it hurt my feelings because I was a little pussy and I cried. He said, 'Well, how do you say it?' I said, Seekay. So he wrote 'C.K' on my jersey and everything. He made my name 'C.K' and I just stuck with it.
      Dating is horrible, it's awful. I don't get it. It's like you're standing there: 'Hi. Do you want to have sex and later wish you hadn't?' It's horrible. And it's awkward at 42 because I don't have the body or the drive. I just sit in the car and hope somebody gets in.
      I don't like waking up. I feel like staying in bed usually, but I can't because I've got two kids standing next to my bed, just eager to live another day.
      After you do standup for for, like, five years, you're kind of screwed because you have no other skills. You can't get other jobs. It's like being in prison: you're not suitable for any other career.
      I'm close to my audience. I think I have more tools in my box than other guys who might try it. Also, I know how to do this stuff. I know how to write and shoot and edit. I'm technically adept and that helped with the website. You need a big skill set.
      I've had, what, two years? Probably five good years. Before that I had twenty years of uncertainty and suffering and ego destruction and poverty. All those things. That'll always outweigh the good times.
      [on Louie (2010)] If they don't let me do it the way it should be done, I just won't do it. And one thing that enables me to do that is that I can go on the road and do comedy. I can just go do standup. I don't need this shit. I really don't... This is the greatest thing that ever happened to me but I don't need it. And I'm eternally grateful to [FX] for letting me do it this way. I don't know why they gave me this much freedom. If I was running FX, I would have never given me what they've given me. It was irresponsible.
      I like pressure. Pressure doesn't make me crack. It's enabling. I eat pressure, and there might be times when I get a bad feeling in my gut that this might be too much, but you feel pressure when you're not doing something, you know? When you're getting ready for something, you feel pressure-when you're anticipating. But when you're constantly in activity, there's no time for pressure to just sit there and make you crack.
      [on the success of Louie (2010)] The show has been a precious thing to me, and it's been something I'm horribly grateful for. It's just such a big deal to me that I'm getting to do this. I'm aware of how fleeting it is. I'm aware that, at best, it'll go eight years, and that a year after those eight years are over, it'll feel like a distant memory. I'm aware of that.
      [on having complete control of Louie (2010)] To me, it's not that I control a bunch of people, it's just that nobody controls me. There's nothing above me except responsibility to the product. That's the ultimate responsibility, is if the show sucks, then what was the fucking point of being in charge? I'm right about these things on the show, and when I'm not, it's interesting to watch me be wrong. I don't think you have to be perfect, you just have to be compelling in the work you do.
      I've had two great years, probably five good years. So I had 20 years of just kind of uncertainty and suffering and ego destruction and poverty. All these things. There's no way I'm ever going to catch up to the misery years. It's impossible.... If I don't do anything dumb or I don't get a disease or something, and then I've got to five to eight years I think where it'll really be great and then it will start to degenerate like uranium, you know?
      [on his deal with FX for Louie (2010)] No one on the planet Earth has what I have right now. No one ever has. And I don't know that I ever will again.
      Human kindness has no reward. You should give to others in every way you see. You should expect absolutely nothing from anyone. It should be your goal to love every human you encounter. All human suffering that you're aware of and continues without your effort to stop it becomes your crime. Humans are always evolving. If you do one thing that if done by every human would destroy the world, that makes you Hitler... I don't live by any of those. But I believe them all very strongly.
      [on his jokes about his children] I definitely heighten everything for the material, you know? I don't act the way that I do onstage at home. I feel maybe 5% of what I say on stage and then I amplify it because it's fun. It's a release. But in real life I'm very patient with my kids. I don't have any animosity towards them and they're constantly fascinating. They don't bother me! And I love being with them and I'm very responsible with them. I take a lot of care with them. But that's not the way I am on the show. On the show I act the way I really feel, which is, fucking get me outta here! But that's only sometimes. And I think all parents feel that way.
      [on Pootie Tang (2001)] It comes from way back when I was a kid and I used to enjoy talking nonsense. But I used to try to talk nonsense believably, you know what I mean? Like I'm really communicating, and not just talking a string of gibberish. It's something I used to do all the time: "Hey, it's a tippi tai a ma tammy fae." I just used to talk like that. Then I started trying to think of a sketch for Chris Rock, and I came up with the notion of a guy who's so cool, he doesn't even speak English, but he exudes this coolness and this ease, and Chris buys into it and doesn't question it, and just chats with him. The notion to me was that someone could just be flipping around and see this, and it would take them a few beats to see that these guys aren't saying anything.
      [on the failure of Pootie Tang (2001)] They wanted Austin Powers, plain and simple, for black people. They wanted a brightly lit, easy, punchy comedy, and that's not what I wrote and not what I directed. I directed something with a little more texture to it, I think, and a little more grit. Another problem was that I thought we were making a low-budget movie that would go to Sundance, and everyone would say "How did you do this for $4 million? There's a car chase, there's all this stuff." But they didn't promote it that way. They just said, "Here's Paramount's next movie." So a lot of critics said, "This is the most irresponsible piece of..." They hated it.
      [on the cult status of Pootie Tang (2001)] There's a lot in that movie I love. It makes me happy that a world I created and wrote and shot made people happy and then lived on. After all, there aren't many other movies from that year that people still want to see now. But still, there's some regret as to how it came out, and things like that. It was worth it, though, because it was probably the most significant education of all the surviving-failure lessons I've gotten. Also, I think the success it's had proves that there's a little more to what I was saying than they thought. I think that if they had let me have even a little more freedom, it could have been more of a success.
      [on his material about fatherhood] I started talking about it on stage a lot, just to blow off steam. I never thought I'd do material about kids, but I started getting really stressed out and not sleeping a lot. It's a very difficult thing, way harder than anything I've described to you so far. And the stakes are so much higher and more exhilarating and wonderful and all that. I started talking about it onstage and being very dark in the way I talk about my kid, saying things like, "I can understand these babies-in-the-garbage-can stories now. I wouldn't do it, but I understand it." I figured I'd just get booed, but that it'd be worth it, because I needed the release. I found that parents were coming up to me and saying, "Oh, we love this stuff."
      [on whether he considers himself a Latino] Latino is kind of... racial labels can be confusing. I am a Mexican American. My dad's Mexican. That was my first language and I lived there. I definitely identify more with being American because that's mostly how I grew up. And a lot of Latino comedians are from like Southern California, that kind of thing. And I don't speak Spanish, at least not on stage. Although I have thought it would be fun if I could get my Spanish back to where it was, to do comedy in Spanish, it would be fun.
      [on Tig Notaro's onstage chronicling many recent tragic events in her life] I was crying and laughing and listening like never in my life. Here was this small woman standing alone against death and simply reporting where her mind had been and what had happened and employing her gorgeously acute stand-up.
      [on receiving applause at start of his HBO's special] I don't necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate it very much.
      I think that failing at Pootie Tang (2001) is why this show [Louie (2010)] is good. It's one of the reasons. It's that and a huge - just an army of failures that have wrecked my life, made me good at this. I got to make a movie finally, which was my dream, and it was terrible, and then it got made even more terrible, and then it came out, and I was just hated. I mean, the first time I was known by a lot of people was because I made a bad movie. And I remember watching Roger Ebert say -- I grew up watching Roger Ebert doing movie criticism, and he said, 'I can't even say this is a bad movie, because it's not even complete. It's incomplete. It's not even a movie.' It was the worst. I think it's probably the worst review he ever gave to a movie... But the great thing is that after maybe a week, it just goes away, and all you're left with is the forensic evidence of all the mistakes you made and all of the rocks that you've kind of crashed into, and you're left with this beautiful map of where all the dangers are, and you repair all the holes, and then you're so much better.
      [on Lucky Louie (2006)] I'm a vulgar, fucked-up degenerate comedian who did drugs. And I'm connecting with Christian mothers and fathers. I love that. That means so much to me.
      To me, comedies are usually the least funny movies. Movies that are actually a comedy are usually not all that funny. To me Goodfellas (1990) and Raging Bull (1980) are two of the funniest movies I ever saw.
      The Jackass (2000) movies are honestly some of the best movies I've ever seen. I laugh so hard at them. Those guys are geniuses. If they had grown up with a different group of people, they could've been performance artists at Bard College, and people would be writing papers about them.
      Coming here and observing America as an outsider made me an observing person. I grew up in Boston and didn't get the accent, and one of the reasons is that I started in Spanish. I was a little kid, so all I had to do was completely reject my Spanish and my Mexican past, which is a whole lot easier because I'm white with red hair. I had the help of a whole nation of people just accepting that I'm white.
      Race doesn't mean what it used to in America anymore. It just doesn't. Obama's black, but he's not black the way people used to define that. Is black your experience or the color of your skin? My experience is as a Mexican immigrant, more so than someone like George Lopez. He's from California. But he'll be treated as an immigrant. I am an outsider. My abuelita, my grandmother, didn't speak English. My whole family on my dad's side is in Mexico. I won't ever be called that or treated that way, but it was my experience.

Louis C.K. Overview:A 20+ year veteran of the stand-up comedy scene, Louis C.K. is also an accomplished filmmaker and award-winning writer. Influenced by comics like George Carlin and Richard Pryor, C.K. is a master of black humor and a perpetual victim of his own life. He is primarily an observational comic, but directs most of his observations towards his own life -- often mining his marriage and his children as sources for his comedy.In the Beginning:Louis Szekely was born in September of 1967 in Washington, D.C. Growing up in Massachusetts, he began using the abbreviated "C.K." in grade school because he felt his name was too difficult to pronounce.
In 1984, C.K. tried stand-up for the first time at a comedy club open mic in Boston. It went badly, and C.K. stayed away from comedy for the next two years. He returned in '86, and quickly became a staple of the then-hot Boston comedy scene.New York and Filmmaking:In 1989, C.K. moved to New York to perform stand-up. He appeared as a comic on several TV series, including Comic Strip Live and MTV Half Hour Comedy Hour and Evening at the Improv.
In 1990, he made his first short film, called "Caesar's Salad." He took it around the festival circuit and had some success, and has been making short films ever since. He would go on to make eight more short films over the course of his career before getting into features.TV Writing:In 1993, C.K. began his successful career as a TV writer. He joined the original staff of the then-new Late Night With Conan O'Brien, where he worked for two years and created still-famous bits like "Staring Contest."
In 1995, he performed on Late Night with David Letterman and was such a hit that he joined the writing staff. He only worked there for a few months before he was made head writer and producer of the short-lived ABC sketch show The Dana Carvey Show, alongside comics like Steve Carell, Stephen Colbert and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman.In 1996, C.K. starred in his first HBO Comedy Half Hour special. The same year, he became a writer and producer on comedian Chris Rock's talk show The Chris Rock Show, forging a long working relationship between the two. He received four Emmy nominations and one Emmy win for his work on the show.
In 1997, C.K. wrote and directed his first feature film, an independent work called Tomorrow Night, co-starring fellow comedians like Nick Di Paolo, Wanda Sykes, Amy Poehler, Todd Barry and Steve Carell.More Feature Film Work:In 2000, C.K. made his second feature, Pootie Tang, co-written by Rock. The movie was a critical bomb, but has gone on to become something of a cult favorite. C.K. hasn't directed another feature since.
He did re-team with Rock on two more film projects, co-writing the Rock vehicles Down to Earth (2001) and I Think I Love My Wife (2007), the latter of which Rock also directed.Stand-up Success for Louis C.K.:Throughout all of his TV work, C.K. continued to write and perform stand-up comedy. In 2001, he released his first stand-up album, Louis C.K. Live in Houston.
In 2006, he created and starred in Lucky Louie, a traditional (but R-rated) sitcom for HBO. It garnered good reviews, but was canceled after just one season.
In 2006, he taped his first HBO comedy special, Shameless. His second special, Chewed Up, aired on Showtime in 2008.
In 2009, C.K. starred in the films Diminished Capacity and The Invention of Lying, written and directed by Ricky Gervais.Additional Louis C.K. Facts:

Louis C.K.Comedian / ActorBorn: 12 September 1967Birthplace: Washington, D.C.Best known as:  The ginger-haired comedian star of TV's LouieName at birth: Louis Szekely Louis C.K. is a writer and actor who stars in the cable comedy series Louie, a sitcom based on his life as a stand-up comedian and divorced father of two. While paying his dues as a comic in Boston and New York, Louis Szekely ("C.K." is supposedly a stage name version of his Hungarian surname) got the attention of Robert Smigel and Conan O'Brien in the early 1990s, just as Late Night with Conan O'Brien was about to replace David Letterman on network TV. Louis C.K. was an aspiring filmmaker as well as a comedy writer, and within a few years his short films, audience appeal and hard-working approach paid off. By 1996 he had a special on HBO, and his first TV series, the short-lived Lucky Louie. Working his way along, Louis C.K. wrote for Chris Rock and got a second Emmy nomination (his first was with Conan), then had cable TV specials, appeared in movies (2009's The Invention of Lying), was a semi-regular in TV shows (Parks and Recreation, as Amy Poehler's suitor) and toured as a stand-up comedian with as many TV guest spots as possible. Then his cable series Louie debuted in 2010, making Louis C.K. an overnight success after 25 years in the business. Louis C.K., a.k.a. "the ginger comic," is known for his ability to joke cynically -- even harshly -- about modern life, while managing to avoid, for the most part, sounding mean. Louis C.K. has also demonstrated an internet-savvy business sense over the years, having great success selling concert DVDs and live performance tickets directly to online fans. For his work on Louie, he was nominated for an Emmy as an actor as well as a writer (2011).Extra credit:  Louis C.K.'s real name is Louis Szekely, and he is of Mexican-Hungarian descent... His grandfather was a Hungarian who settled in Mexico and married a native. Louis's dad was born in Mexico City and went to grad school at Harvard, where he met Louis's mother (a summer student from Michigan). Louis spent the first 6 or 7 years of his life in Mexico City, but then his folks split up and he grew up in Newton, Massachusetts... The music for Louie is done by Reggie Watts.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC. All rights reserved.

													Louis C.K. tells Rolling Stone about his surprisingly complex racial identity in an upcoming cover story. (Rolling Stone)
The award-winning comedian -- who was born in the U.S., but lived in Mexico for several years as a child -- is the subject of an upcoming Rolling Stone cover story, in which he talks candidly about his surprisingly complex racial identity.  
Coming here and observing America as an outsider made me an observing person. I grew up in Boston and didn't get the accent, and one of the reasons is that I started in Spanish. I was a little kid, so all I had to do was completely reject my Spanish and my Mexican past, which is a whole lot easier because I'm white with red hair. I had the help of a whole nation of people just accepting that I'm white. 
C.K. has retained his Mexican citizenship. His father was born in the country to Hungarian and Mexican parents.
The comedian goes on to observe that racial identity in the United States is more complicated now than in the past. "Race doesn't mean what it used to in America anymore," he said, using the example of President Barack Obama to illustrate his point, before circling back to his own history.
My experience is as a Mexican immigrant, more so than someone like George Lopez. He's from California. But he'll be treated as an immigrant. I am an outsider. My abuelita, my grandmother, didn't speak English. My whole family on my dad's side is in Mexico. I won't ever be called that or treated that way, but it was my experience.
C.K. has covered similar ground before. In his 2010 comedy special, "Hilarious," the comedian talked at length about white privilege, identifying it as "a huge leg up" in a society whose legacy of racial prejudice lingers in the present day. In an interview on "The Tonight Show" with Jay Leno earlier this year, he observed the ways in which some white Americans have tried to retire the subject of slavery to the recesses of history and minimize its impact on modern life.
"[Slavery] was 140 years ago," he pointed out to Leno. "That’s two 70-year-old ladies living and dying back to back. That’s how recently you could buy a guy."
C.K.'s new hour-long special, "Louis C.K.: Oh My God," debuts on HBO this Saturday. His FX series "Louie" is currently on hiatus. Its fourth season will appear in May 2014.

Disney World To Expose Kids To 'Public Displays Of Perversion' During 'Gay Days' Event, Activist Claims

His first language is Spanish, and he retains his Mexican citizenship, according to Best Of Comedy Online. So, C.K. is actually half Latino and has a Mexican passport. 
On his last visit to The Tonight Show With Conan O'Brien, the comedian poked fun of the racism surrounding immigration, referring to a comment a woman once made against Mexicans. The woman was left speechless after she found out C.K. was Mexican. He talked about when he first came to the U.S. as "a young Mexican boy" and thought, "America es muy bonito!" ("America is very pretty!"), as he put it a child's voice.
