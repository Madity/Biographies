Tori Amos (born Myra Ellen Amos; August 22, 1963) is an eight-time Grammy Award–nominated American singer-songwriter, pianist and composer. She is a classically trained musician and possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range.[2][3]
Amos originally served as the lead singer of short-lived 1980s pop group Y Kant Tori Read before achieving her breakthrough as a solo artist in the early 1990s, becoming one of the world's most prominent female singer-songwriters. She was also noteworthy early in her solo career as one of the few alternative rock performers to use a piano as her primary instrument. Some of her charting singles include "Crucify", "Silent All These Years", "God", "Cornflake Girl", "Caught a Lite Sneeze", "Professional Widow", "Spark", "1000 Oceans", "Flavor", and "A Sorta Fairytale", her most commercially successful single in the U.S. to date.[4] Amos has sold more than 12 million albums worldwide.[5] She has been nominated for and won several awards in different genres, ranging from MTV VMAs to classical music with an Echo award in 2012.[6]
Amos is the third child of Mary Ellen (Copeland) and Rev. Dr. Edison McKinley Amos.[7] She was born at the Old Catawba Hospital in Newton, North Carolina, during a trip from their Georgetown home in Washington, D.C. Amos has said that her maternal grandparents each had a Eastern Cherokee grandparent of their own; of particular importance to her as a child was her grandfather, Calvin Clinton Copeland, who was a great source of inspiration and guidance, offering a more pantheistic spiritual alternative to her father and paternal grandmother's traditional Christianity.[8] When she was two, her family moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where she began to play the piano. By age five, she had begun composing instrumental pieces on piano and, while living in Rockville, Maryland, she won a full scholarship to the Preparatory Division of the Peabody Conservatory of Music.[2] Her scholarship was discontinued at age 11 and she was asked to leave. Amos has asserted that she lost the scholarship because of her interest in rock and popular music, coupled with her dislike for reading from sheet music.[2] In 1972, the Amos family moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, where her father became pastor of the Good Shepherd United Methodist church. At the age of 13 she began playing at gay bars and piano bars, chaperoned by her father.[2][9]
Amos first came to local notice by winning a county teen talent contest in 1977, singing a song called "More Than Just a Friend". As a senior at Richard Montgomery High School, she co-wrote "Baltimore" with her brother Mike Amos for a competition involving the Baltimore Orioles. The song won the contest and became her first single, released as a 7" single pressed locally for family and friends during 1980 with another Amos-penned composition as a B-side, "Walking With You". Before this she performed under her middle name, Ellen, but permanently adopted Tori after a friend's boyfriend told her it suited her.[10] At age 21, Amos moved to Los Angeles to pursue her music career after several years performing on the piano bar circuit of the D.C. area.[11]
In 1986, Amos formed a music group, Y Kant Tori Read, the name of which was a reference to her days at the Peabody Conservatory, where she was able to play songs on her piano by ear, but was never successful at sight reading.[12] In addition to Amos, the group was composed of Steve Caton (who would later play guitars on all her subsequent albums until 1999), drummer Matt Sorum, bass player Brad Cobb and, for a short time, keyboardist Jim Tauber. Following several phases of writing and recording, during which Amos has since asserted that the band lost their musical edge and direction due to interference from record executives, in July 1988, the Y Kant Tori Read's self-titled debut album was released. Although its producer, Joe Chiccarelli, has stated that Amos was very happy with the album at the time,[13] it is now out of print and Amos has expressed no interest in reissuing it.[14] Following the album's commercial failure and the group's subsequent disbanding, Amos began working with other artists (including Stan Ridgway, Sandra Bernhard, and Al Stewart) as a backup vocalist. She also recorded a song called "Distant Storm" for the film China O'Brien; in the credits, the song is attributed to a band called Tess Makes Good.[15] It was the only song recorded by the band, and its only commercial release was in the film.
Despite the disappointing reaction to Y Kant Tori Read, Amos still had to comply with her six-record contract with Atlantic Records, who in 1989 wanted a new record by March 1990. The initial recordings were declined by the label, which Amos felt was because the album had not been properly presented.[16] The album was reworked and expanded under the guidance of Doug Morris and the musical talents of Steve Caton, Eric Rosse, Will MacGregor, Carlo Nuccio, and Dan Nebenzal, resulting in Little Earthquakes, an album recounting her religious upbringing, sexual awakening, struggle to establish her identity, and sexual assault. This album became her commercial and artistic breakthrough.
Amos traveled to New Mexico with personal and professional partner Eric Rosse in 1993 to write and largely record her second solo record, Under the Pink. The album was received with mostly favorable reviews and sold enough copies to chart at No. 12 on the Billboard 200, a significantly higher position than the preceding album's position at No. 54 on the same chart.[17]
Her third solo album, Boys for Pele, was released in January 1996. The album was recorded in an Irish church, in Delgany, County Wicklow, with Amos taking advantage of the church recording setting to create an album ripe with baroque influences, lending it a darker sound and style. She added harpsichord, harmonium, and clavichord to her keyboard repertoire, and also included such anomalies as a gospel choir, bagpipes, church bells, and drum programming. The album garnered mixed reviews upon its release, with some critics praising its intensity and uniqueness while others bemoaned its comparative impenetrability. Despite the album's erratic lyrical content and instrumentation, the latter of which kept it away from mainstream audiences, Boys for Pele is Amos's most successful simultaneous transatlantic release, reaching No. 2 on both the Billboard 200 and the UK Top 40 upon its release at the height of her fame.[18][19]
Fueled by the desire to have her own recording studio to distance herself from record company executives,[20] Amos had the barn of her home in Cornwall converted into a state-of-the-art recording studio, Martian Engineering Studios.
From the Choirgirl Hotel and To Venus and Back, released in May 1998 and September 1999, respectively, differ greatly from previous albums as Amos's trademark acoustic piano-based sound is largely replaced with arrangements that include elements of electronica, dance music, vocal washes and sonic landscapes. The underlying themes of both albums deal with womanhood, and Amos's own miscarriages and marriage. Reviews for From the Choirgirl Hotel were mostly favorable and praised Amos's continued artistic originality. While not her highest chart debut, debut sales for From the Choirgirl Hotel are Amos's best to date, selling 153,000 copies in its first week.[21] To Venus and Back, a two-disc release of original studio material and live material recorded from the previous world tour, received mostly positive reviews and included the first major-label single available for sale as a digital download.[22]
Motherhood inspired Amos to produce a cover album, recording songs written by men about women and reversing the gender roles to show a woman's perspective.[23] That idea grew into Strange Little Girls, released in September 2001, one year after giving birth to her daughter. The album is Amos's first concept album, with artwork featuring Amos photographed in character of the women portrayed in each song. Amos would later reveal that a stimulus for the album was to end her contract with Atlantic without giving them new original songs; Amos felt that since 1998, the label had not been properly promoting her and had trapped her in a contract by refusing to sell her to another label.[24]
With her Atlantic contract fulfilled after a 15-year stint, Amos signed to Epic in late 2001. In October 2002, Amos released Scarlet's Walk, another concept album. Described as a "sonic novel", the album explores Amos's alter ego, Scarlet, intertwined with her cross-country concert tour following 9/11. Through the songs, Amos explores such topics as the history of America, American people, Native American history, pornography, masochism, homophobia and misogyny. The album had a strong debut at No. 7 on the Billboard 200.[25] Scarlet's Walk is Amos's last album to date to reach certified gold status from the RIAA.[26]
Not long after Amos was ensconced with her new label, she received unsettling news when Polly Anthony resigned as president of Epic Records in 2003. Anthony had been one of the primary reasons Amos signed with the label and as a result of her resignation, Amos formed the Bridge Entertainment Group. Further trouble for Amos occurred the following year when her label, Epic/Sony Music Entertainment, merged with BMG Entertainment as a result of the industry's decline.[27] Amos would later hint in interviews that during the creation of her next album, those in charge at the label following the aforementioned merger were interested "only in making money", the effects of which on the album have not been disclosed.[citation needed]
Amos released two more albums with the label, The Beekeeper (2005) and American Doll Posse (2007). Both albums received mixed reviews, some of which stated that the albums suffered from being too long.[28][29] The Beekeeper was conceptually influenced by the ancient art of beekeeping, which she considered a source of female inspiration and empowerment. Through extensive study, Amos also wove in the stories of the Gnostic gospels and the removal of women from a position of power within the Christian church to create an album based largely on religion and politics. The album debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200,[30] placing her in an elite group of women who have secured five or more US Top 10 album debuts.[31] While the newly merged label was present throughout the production process of The Beekeeper, Amos and her crew nearly completed her next project, American Doll Posse, before inviting the label to listen to it. American Doll Posse, another concept album, is fashioned around a group of girls (the "posse") who are used as a theme of alter-egos of Amos's. Musically and stylistically, the album saw Amos return to a more confrontational nature.[32] Like its predecessor, American Doll Posse debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200.[17]
During her tenure with Epic Records, Amos also released a retrospective collection titled Tales of a Librarian (2003) through her former label, Atlantic Records; a two-disc DVD set Fade to Red (2006) containing most of Amos's solo music videos, released through the Warner Bros. reissue imprint Rhino; a five disc box set titled A Piano: The Collection (2006), celebrating Amos's 15-year solo career through remastered album tracks, remixes, alternate mixes, demos, and a string of unreleased songs from album recording sessions, also released through Rhino; and numerous official bootlegs from two world tours, The Original Bootlegs (2005) and Legs & Boots (2007) through Epic Records.
In May 2008, Amos announced that, due to creative and financial disagreements with Epic Records, she had negotiated an end to her contract with the record label, and would be operating independently of major record labels on future work.[33][34] In September of the same year, Amos released a live album and DVD, Live at Montreux 1991/1992, through Eagle Rock Entertainment, of two performances she gave at the Montreux Jazz Festival very early on in her career while promoting her debut solo album, Little Earthquakes. By December, after a chance encounter with chairman and CEO of Universal Music Group, Doug Morris, Amos signed a "joint venture" deal with Universal Republic Records.[35][36][37][38]
Abnormally Attracted to Sin, Amos's tenth solo studio album and her first album released through Universal Republic, was released in May 2009 to mostly positive reviews. The album debuted in the top 10 of the Billboard 200,[39] making it Amos's seventh album to do so.[40] Abnormally Attracted to Sin, admitted Amos, is a "personal album", not a conceptual one, with the album exploring themes of power, boundaries, and the subjective view of sin.[41] Continuing her distribution deal with Universal Republic, Amos released Midwinter Graces, her first seasonal album, in November of the same year. The album features reworked versions of traditional carols, as well as original songs written by Amos.[42]
During her contract with the label, Amos recorded vocals for two songs for David Byrne's collaboration album with Fatboy Slim, entitled Here Lies Love,[43] which was released in April 2010. In July of the same year, the DVD Tori Amos- Live from the Artists Den was released exclusively through Barnes & Noble.
After a brief tour from June to September 2010, Amos released the highly exclusive live album From Russia With Love in December the same year, recorded live in Moscow on September 3, 2010. The limited edition set included a signature edition Lomography Diana F+ camera, along with 2 lenses, a roll of film and 1 of 5 photographs taken of Tori during her time in Moscow. The set was released exclusively through toriamos.com and only 2000 copies were produced.
In September 2011, Amos released her first classical music album, Night of Hunters, featuring variations on a theme to pay tribute to such renowned composers as Bach, Chopin, Debussy, Granados, Satie and Schubert, through the Deutsche Grammophon label, a division of Universal Music Group. Amos recorded the album with several musicians, including the Apollon Musagète string quartet.
To mark the 20th anniversary of her debut album Little Earthquakes (1992), Amos released an album of songs from her back catalogue re-worked and re-recorded with the Metropole Orchestra. The album, titled Gold Dust, was released in October 2012 through Deutsche Grammophon.[44]
On May 1, 2012, Amos announced the formation of her own record label Transmission Galactic, which she intends to use to develop new artists. One of the first artists signed is singer/songwriter, Lawrence Casey.
In 2013, Amos collaborated with The Bullitts on the track "Wait Until Tomorrow" from their debut album They Die by Dawn & Other Short Stories. She has also stated in an interview that a new album and tour will materialize in 2014 and that it will be a "return to contemporary music".[45]
September 2013 saw the launch of Tori Amos' much anticipated musical project adaptation, George MacDonald's The Light Princess, along with book writer Samuel Adamson and Marianne Elliott. It premiered at London's Royal National Theatre and ended February 2014. The Light Princess and its lead actress Rosalie Craig were nominated for Best Musical and Best Musical Performance, respectively, at the prestigious Evening Standard Award. Rosalie Craig won the Best Musical Performance category. Plans of bringing The Light Princess to Broadway theatre are underway, and a cast recording release in 2015 via Universal.
Amos' 14th studio album, Unrepentant Geraldines, was released May 13, 2014 via Mercury Classics/Universal Music Classics in the US. Its first single, "Trouble's Lament", was released on March 28. The new album is being supported by the Unrepentant Geraldines Tour which began May 5, 2014 in Cork and will be heading across Europe before touring North America in July/August 2014. Her tour will also include South Africa.[46]
According to press release, Unrepentant Geraldines is a "return to her core identity as a creator of contemporary songs of exquisite beauty following a series of more classically-inspired and innovative musical projects of the last four years. [It is] both one further step in the artistic evolution of one of the most successful and influential artists of her generation, and a return to the inspiring and personal music that Amos is known for all around the world."[47]
Released in conjunction with The Beekeeper, Amos co-authored an autobiography with rock music journalist Ann Powers entitled Piece by Piece (2005). The book's subject is Amos's interest in mythology and religion, exploring her songwriting process, rise to fame, and her relationship with Atlantic Records.
Image Comics released Comic Book Tattoo (2008), a collection of comic stories, each based on or inspired by songs recorded by Amos. Editor Rantz Hoseley worked with Amos to gather 80 different artists for the book, including Pia Guerra, David Mack, and Leah Moore.
Additionally, Amos and her music have been the subject of numerous official and unofficial books, as well as academic critique, including Tori Amos: Lyrics (2001) and an earlier biography, Tori Amos: All These Years (1996).[48][49][50]
"Tori Amos: In the Studio" (2011) by Jake Brown features an in-depth look at Amos's career, discography and recording process.[51]
Early in her professional career, Amos befriended author Neil Gaiman, who became a fan after she referred to him in the song "Tear in Your Hand" and also in print interviews.[52] Although created before the two met, the character Delirium from Gaiman's The Sandman series (or even her sister Death) is inspired by Amos; Gaiman has stated that they "steal shamelessly from each other".[53] She wrote the foreword to his collection Death: The High Cost of Living; he in turn wrote the introduction to Comic Book Tattoo. Gaiman is godfather to her daughter and a poem written for her birth, Blueberry Girl, was published as a children's book of the same name in 2009.[54]
Amos married English sound engineer Mark Hawley on February 22, 1998. Their only child, a daughter named Natashya "Tash" Lórien Hawley, was born on September 5, 2000, a few weeks after Tori's 37th birthday. The family divides its time among Sewall's Point in Florida, Kinsale[55] (County Cork) in Ireland, and Cornwall in England.
In June 1994, Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), a toll-free help line in the US connecting callers with their local rape crisis center, was founded. Amos made the ceremonial first call to launch the hotline.[56] Amos, herself a survivor of sexual assault,[57] became the first national spokesperson for the organization. In the summer of 2006, when RAINN received its one millionth caller,[58] Amos had been a supporter of the organization for 12 years.[59] On August 18, 2013 a concert in honor of her 50th birthday was held, an event which raised money for RAINN.[60]
Amos, who has been performing in bars and clubs from as early as 1976 and under her professional name as early as 1991 has performed more than 1,000 shows since her first world tour in 1992. In 2003, Amos was voted fifth best touring act by the readers of Rolling Stone magazine. Her concerts are notable for their changing set lists from night to night.
Amos's first world tour began on January 29, 1992 in London and ended on November 30, 1992 in Auckland. She performed solo with a Yamaha CP-70 unless the venue was able to provide a piano.[61][62] The tour included 142 concerts around the globe.
Amos's second world tour began on February 24, 1994 in Newcastle upon Tyne and ended on December 13, 1994 in Perth, Western Australia. Amos performed solo each night on her iconic Bösendorfer[citation needed] piano, and on a prepared piano during "Bells for Her". The tour included 181 concerts.
The third world tour began on February 23, 1996 in Ipswich, England, and ended on November 11, 1996 in Boulder. Amos performed each night on piano, harpsichord, and harmonium, with Steve Caton on guitar on some songs. The tour included 187 concerts.
Amos's first band tour. Amos, on piano and Kurzweil keyboard, was joined by Steve Caton on guitar, Matt Chamberlain on drums, and Jon Evans on bass. The tour began on April 18, 1998 in Fort Lauderdale and ended on December 3, 1998 in East Lansing, Michigan, including 137 concerts.
Amos's fifth tour was North America–only. The first part of the tour was co-headlining with Alanis Morissette and featured the same band and equipment line-up as in 1998. Amos and the band continued for eight shows before Amos embarked on a series of solo shows. The tour began on August 18, 1999 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and ended on December 9, 1999 in Denver, including 46 concerts.
This tour was Amos's first since becoming a mother in 2000 and her first tour fully solo since 1994 (Steve Caton was present on some songs in 1996). It saw Amos perform on piano, Rhodes piano, and Wurlitzer electric piano, and though the tour was in support of her covers album, the set lists were not strictly covers-oriented. Having brought her one-year-old daughter on the road with her, this tour was also one of Amos's shortest ventures, lasting just three months. It began on August 30, 2001 in London and ended on December 17, 2001 in Milan, including 55 concerts.
Amos's seventh tour saw her reunited with Matt Chamberlain and Jon Evans, but not Steve Caton. The first part of the tour, which featured Amos on piano, Rhodes, and Wurlitzer, was six months long and Amos went out again in the summer of 2003 for a tour with Ben Folds opening. The tour began on November 7, 2002 in Tampa and ended on September 4, 2003 in West Palm Beach, featuring 124 concerts. The final show of the tour was filmed and released as part of a DVD/CD set titled Welcome to Sunny Florida (the set also included a studio EP titled Scarlet's Hidden Treasures, an extension of the Scarlet's Walk album).
This tour began on April 1, 2005 in Clearwater, Florida, with Amos on piano, two Hammond B-3 organs, and Rhodes. The tour also encompassed Australia for the first time since 1994. Amos announced at a concert on this tour that she would never stop touring but would scale down the tours. Amos returned to the road in August and September for the Summer of Sin North America leg, ending on September 17, 2005 in Los Angeles. The tour featured "Tori's Piano Bar", where fans could nominate cover songs on Amos's website which she would then choose from to play in a special section of each show. One of the songs chosen was the Kylie Minogue hit "Can't Get You Out of My Head", which Amos dedicated to her the day after Minogue's breast cancer was announced to the public. Other songs performed by Amos include The Doors' "People are Strange", Depeche Mode's "Personal Jesus", Joni Mitchell's "The Circle Game", Madonna's "Live to Tell" and "Like a Prayer", Björk's "Hyperballad", Led Zeppelin's "When the Levee Breaks" (which she debuted in Austin, Texas, just after the events of Hurricane Katrina), Kate Bush's "And Dream of Sheep" and Crowded House's "Don't Dream It's Over", dedicating it to drummer Paul Hester who had died a week before. The entire concert tour featured 82 concerts, and six full-length concerts were released as The Original Bootlegs.
This was Amos's first tour with a full band since her 1999 Five and a Half Weeks Tour, accompanied by long-time band mates Jon Evans and Matt Chamberlain, with guitarist Dan Phelps rounding out Amos's new band.[63] Amos's equipment included her piano, a Hammond B-3 organ, and two Yamaha S90 ES keyboards. The tour kicked off with its European leg in Rome, Italy on May 28, 2007, which lasted through July, concluding in Israel; the Australian leg took place during September; the North American leg lasted from October to December 16, 2007, when the tour concluded in Los Angeles. Amos opened each show dressed as one of the four non-Tori personae from the album, then Amos would emerge as herself to perform for the remaining two-thirds of the show. The entire concert tour featured 93 concerts, and 27 full-length concerts of the North American tour were released as official bootlegs in the Legs and Boots series.
For her tenth tour, Amos returned to the trio format of her 2002 and 2003 tours with bassist Jon Evans and drummer Matt Chamberlain while expanding her lineup of keyboards by adding three M-Audio MIDI controllers to her ensemble of her piano, a Hammond B-3 organ, and a Yamaha S90 ES keyboard. The North American and European band tour began on July 10, 2009 in Seattle, Washington and ended in Warsaw on October 10, 2009. A solo leg through Australia began in Melbourne on November 12, 2009 and ended in Brisbane on November 24, 2009. The entire tour featured 63 concerts.
Amos's eleventh tour was her first with a string quartet, Apollon Musagète, (Amos's equipment includes her piano and a Yamaha S90 ES keyboard) and her first time touring in South Africa. It kicked off on September 28, 2011 in Finland, Helsinki Ice Hall and ended on December 22, 2011 in Dallas, Texas.[64]
In 2003, the Tori Amos album Scarlet's Walk (deluxe edition) was nominated in the category "Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Packaging", this nomination went to the art directors Dave Bett and Sherri Lee.
Also in 2003, "Timo on Tori (Don't Make Me Come To Vegas) a remix of the Tori Amos song Don't Make Me Come to Vegas was nominated in the category "Best Remixed Recording, Non Classical" this nomination went to the remixers Mark Buttrich and Timo Maas.

After spending her youth studying classical piano, child prodigy Tori Amos made her first foray into rock with the late-1980s hair-metal band Y Kant Tori Read. The group’s career was mercifully short, and it was a return to her beloved piano and the development of an intimate, and sometimes indulgent, style of pop songwriting that brought Amos widespread success.
 This alt-worthiness was reinforced when her piano-and-voice version of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" (from the Crucify EP, which also includes Tori treatments of the Stones and Led Zep) garnered significant alternative airplay.  
 Though she'd materialized briefly four years before, fronting a best-forgotten hairspray band that also included future Guns N' Roses drummer Matt Sorum, her solo debut, Little Earthquakes, was one of that year's most improbable success stories.  
 Under the Pink is nearly as good. It beats the sophomore jinx by taking more chances–breaking away from personal pain in "God" ("Do you need a woman to look after you?") and "Cornflake Girl," even as her lyrics dive deeper into abstraction. 
 Her popularity had become so great that Boys for Pele entered the charts at #2, but this difficult album resists meeting comprehension even halfway. The pain displayed on "Hey Jupiter" is clear and convincing. 
 The move to a band format on From the Choirgirl Hotel provides the focus that had been lacking on the previous album, and pushes her singing to carry as much meaning as the words.  
 To Venus and Back is an ambitious, and only intermittently successful, double-CD set. The studio disc consists of new songs cut with a minimum of preproduction. 
 The mission of Strange Little Girls is gender reversal–Tori takes on a collection of songs ostensibly written from a male viewpoint and turns the tables. 
 There's also a concept to Scarlet's Walk, its suite of songs chronicling a cross-country journey in the aftermath of 9/11. The booklet's color-coded roadmap isn't necessary; these songs feel like a triptych. 
 No compilation could possibly please her famously fussy and proprietary audience, but Tales of a Librarian does a reasonable job of cherry-picking her catalogue, remixing many tracks and reworking some.   
 Though "The Power of Orange Knickers," a tuneful duet with Damen Rice, had plenty of life in it, much of The Beekeeper didn't: The eighty-minute album was underproduced, overlong and bland in spots. 
 The rocking American Doll Posse was a slight improvement, balancing a fuzzy concept (the songs were supposedly written by four different incarnations of Tori Amos) with upbeat songs like "You Can Bring Your Dog." 
=======================================================
Tori Amos (born Myra Ellen Amos) was one of several female singer/songwriters who combined the stark, lyrical attack of alternative rock with a distinctly '70s musical approach, creating music that fell between the orchestrated meditations of Kate Bush and the stripped-down poetics of Joni Mitchell. In addition, she revived the singer/songwriter traditions of the '70s while re-establishing the piano as a rock & roll instrument. With her 1992 album Little Earthquakes, Amos built a dedicated following that expanded with her second album, Under the Pink, before giving way to a decade-spanning legacy.
The daughter of a Methodist preacher, Amos was born in North Carolina but raised in Maryland. She began singing and playing piano in the church choir at the age of four, and songwriting followed shortly afterward. Amos proved to be a quick learner, and her instrumental prowess earned her a scholarship to the preparatory school at Baltimore's Peabody Conservatory. While studying at Peabody, she became infatuated with rock & roll, particularly the music of Led Zeppelin. She lost her scholarship at the age of 11 -- quite possibly due to her interest in popular music -- but continued writing songs nevertheless, eventually moving to Los Angeles in her late teens to become a pop singer. Atlantic Records signed her in 1987, and Amos recorded an uninspired pop-metal album called Y Kant Tori Read the following year. The record was a complete failure, attracting no attention from radio or press and selling very few copies; nevertheless, she didn't lose her record contract. By 1990, Amos had adopted a new approach, singing spare, haunting, semi-confessional piano ballads that were arranged like Kate Bush but had the melodies and lyrical approach of Joni Mitchell. Atlantic sponsored a trip to England in 1991, where she played a series of concerts in support of an EP, Me and a Gun.
The harrowing "Me and a Gun" was an autobiographical song, telling the tale of Amos' own experience with rape. It gained positive reviews throughout the media, and both the EP and the supporting concerts sold well. Little Earthquakes, Amos' first album as a singer/songwriter, was released in 1992 and fared well in both the U.S. and the U.K. The same year, she released the Crucify EP, which featured cover songs like Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and Led Zeppelin's "Thank You." Delivered in early 1994, Under the Pink, the proper follow-up to Little Earthquakes, was an even bigger hit, selling over a million copies and launching the minor hit singles "God" and "Cornflake Girl." Two years later, Amos delivered her third album, Boys for Pele, her most ambitious and difficult record to date. The album debuted at number two and quickly went platinum. 
Amos spent much of 1997 dealing with personal matters, including a miscarriage and a marriage. She also worked on her fourth album, From the Choirgirl Hotel, which was released in the spring of 1998. The two-disc To Venus and Back followed in 1999 to coincide with a tour with Alanis Morissette. In 2001, Amos returned with the covers album Strange Little Girls, which also marked her last release for Atlantic. 
The next year, she found a new label home with Epic and followed with Scarlet's Walk in October. Her eighth studio album, an autobiographical record titled The Beekeeper, was released in 2005. The massive five-disc Piano collection arrived in 2006, boasting a cornucopia of album cuts, B-sides, unedited and alternate versions, demos, and seven previously unissued tracks, followed by the typically eclectic and hard-rocking American Doll Posse in 2007, an all-new collection of songs that found the artist assuming five archetypal personalities, all of whom were based on feminine gods in Greek and Roman mythology. 
As she toured in support of the album, Amos released live digital recordings of each concert as part of the Legs and Boots concert series, which grew to encompass 27 albums. Although each release was made available via iTunes and other online vendors, Amos also released a "best-of" Legs and Boots compilation in March 2009, having created its track list from various recordings during the tour. Meanwhile, she also focused on new material that had been written during the tour, which she soon compiled into her tenth studio album. Entitled Abnormally Attracted to Sin, the album was released in May 2009 by Universal Republic, Amos' new record label. A holiday album, Midwinter Graces, followed closely behind, appearing before the end of 2009 and garnering warm reviews. 
In the summer of 2011, Amos began touring in advance of her next album, the classically based song cycle Night of Hunters. A conceptual work based on familiar motifs by composers Satie, Chopin, Schubert, and Bach, Amos' recording centered on a couple torn apart by life's difficulties and monotonies, and the female protagonist's journey to find wholeness within herself. Amos collaborated on the recording with the string quartet Apollon Musagete, arranger John Philip Shenale, and clarinetist Ernst Ottensamer. Night of Hunters was released by the classical label Deutsche Grammophon in September of 2011; it peaked at 24 on the Billboard 200. Amos' next move was to re-record some of her songs, newly arranged by John Philip Shenale with the Metropole Orchestra. The resulting set, called Gold Dust, appeared almost exactly a year after Night of Hunters; it debuted at 63 on the Billboard 200. In 2013, after several years in gestation, the musical The Light Princess, based on the fairy tale by Scottish seminal fantasy writer George MacDonald and with music and lyrics by Amos, premiered at the National Theatre in London to wild critical acclaim and was nominated for best musical in the prestigious Evening Standard Theatre Awards. The following year, Amos announced her return to pop with her fourteenth studio album, Unrepentant Geraldines. Heavily inspired by her love of fine art, the album appeared in early May 2014. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          At age one, Tori and her family moved to Baltimore, where she spent much of her childhood. She started playing piano at a very early age (2 1/2). At the age of five, she was accepted to the Peabody Conservatory of Music (Arts school); she was the youngest person to be accepted to the school. However, she soon discovered that there were conflicts between her wants and those of the school. At age 11, she was kicked out thereby making her the youngest person to be expelled from the school. She eventually ended up in a rock band called Y Kan't Tori Read, who released an album in 1988. The album was a severe flop, and the band broke up shortly thereafter. Tori has been doing her solo gig ever since, known for her strong voice, eccentric lyrics, and (of course) her exceptional skill on the piano.
          Born Myra Ellen Amos on August 22, 1963 in Newton, North Carolina (but moving to Baltimore, Maryland very shortly thereafter), singer/songwriter and sometimes-actress Tori Amos has accumulated one of the most ravenous, cult- like followings known to the entertainment industry. After cutting a 45"RPM record at the age of 18 called "Baltimore" (which, along with the flip-side song "Walking With You," won her a citation from the mayor of Baltimore and the key to the city,) Amos began recording demonstration songs and sending them out to the recording industry. She had already gained a following in the Washington, D.C. area, most notably performing in gay piano bars. Starting at age 16, she was often accompanied by her minister father, Dr. Rev. Edison Amos. At the age of 21 she moved to Los Angeles and participated in various pop and hair-metal bands, including "Tess Makes Good" and "Skirts on Fire." Eventually she landed herself in a band called "Y Kant Tori Read." The members of the band were relative unknowns, although guitarist Steve Caton had performed with her for several years at that point and continued to do so until 1999 before leaving to pursue his own endeavors. "Y Kant Tori Read" eventually gathered attention from Atlantic Records and was signed to record an album with legendary 80's music producer Joe Chicarelli (who, in the meantime, got Tori various backup vocal gigs on projects by Pherron, Sandra Bernhard and even scored her a song in the soundtrack to the schlocky martial-arts movie "China O'Brien" -- Tori was paid $300). Atlantic Records' main interest was not in the band but in the loopy, sexy, big-haired main vocalist. When Y Kant Tori Read went into the studio to record their first major label album, only Tori and Steve Caton remained. The rest of the band was fleshed out with singer/pianist Kim Bullard (of Kajagoogoo) and Matt Sorum (later of Guns and Roses). The eponymous debut album was a huge flop, selling less than 8,000 copies. The embarrassing music video which aired a few times on MTV featured Tori in skin tight leather pants and a halter top cavorting around a "downtown Los Angeles" studio set with sky-high hair, waving around a sword and dancing with bikers and rock-n-roll girls in pink tutus. The huge failure put Tori in a funk, but her record label was willing to give her one more shot. She switched gears back to the girl-with-a-piano sound she had focused on for much of her youth. (Amos was the youngest person admitted into the Baltimore Peabody Conservatory, though she was kicked out a few years later for refusing to read sheet music. Thus the name of her hair-metal band.) Eventually, through encouragement from friends, she put together the group of songs that would make up her first solo album, "Little Earthquakes." Because the content and sound of the music in "Little Earthquakes" was so different than what was being played on American radio, Atlantic moved Tori to London, England where she almost instantly became a smash hit. Gathering frequent comparisons to Kate Bush, Amos was labeled as a "fruit- loop" and a "kook" by the British press. Who was this 5 foot 1/2" redhead, wearing swimsuits with blue jeans over them, performing intensely personal piano-pop while writhing at her instrument? Amos' debut album eventually garnered several hit singles in both the UK and the US including "Winter," "Silent All These Years," "Crucify" and "China." The most startling song, however, was a track called "Me and a Gun." It was an a'capella account of her own experience with rape, and its impact would be felt by Tori over the next few years. She also gained further notice by releasing an E.P. of the song "Crucify" with three cover songs, most notably a remake of Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit." This would mark Tori's habit of completely reinterprereting other people's works in live performances and as B-sides. At this point Tori started what would become a trademark style of touring for her, spending almost a year tirelessly touring the entire world. She also began her habit of contributing new works to soundtrack albums with the song "Happy Workers" on the TOYS soundtrack. In 1994 Tori released her second album, "Under the Pink." Where her first album was very diary-like, confessional and piano-pop oriented, "Under the Pink" was fleshed out with full orchestral arrangements, lots of guitars and drums, and even a little industrial-techno (on the song "The Waitress"). The album was also lyrically much more inaccessible, with subtext on top of subtext. Songs like "Past the Mission," a hit single, dealt with the sexual relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdelene. It was at this point Tori really developed an underground following of fans who would research and hang onto every word she uttered in an interview, hoping to get a clearer understanding of her music. The album also had hits with "Pretty Good Year," "God," and "Cornflake Girl," a song that addressed the topic of African female genitalia mutilation (in relation to Alice Walker's book "Possessing the Secret of Joy"). The song "God" opened up Tori's ongoing rivalry with the religious right, who objected to the song's content. "God sometimes you just don't come through/Do you need a woman to look after you?" The song was even sent out to radio stations on a promo disc with "some guitar/no guitar" remix versions to lessen the harsh sound. At this time Tori was receiving so many letters from fans who had experiences with rape that she founded "R.A.I.N.N.", the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network. It was, and is to this date, the nation's only 24 hour, completely confidential and toll free hotline for victims of sexual assault. It has gone close to collapse several times and has relied on Tori's generosity to pull itself through. She also contributed the songs "Butterfly" and "Losing My Religion" (a cover of R.E.M.'s hit) to the soundtrack of "Higher Learning." In 1996 Tori released her third album, "Boys For Pele," to critical acclaim but lower album sales. It became clear that she intended to not let up on the cryptical lyricism. On this album she also introduced songs centered around the harpsichord, clavichord and harmonium organ. As she had brought the piano back into the pop scene in 1992, with "Boys For Pele" she crafted incredibly complex pop songs around these antiquated instruments along with orchestra, brass bands and gospel choirs. The album consisted of 19 tracks (and almost 20 non-album tracks released as B-sides on singles). She collaborated with George Porter Jr. of The Meters on the album, which featured southern-influenced artwork including a photo of Tori breast feeding a piglet. (This image was on a billboard in Los Angeles and caused a car accident, resulting in a publicized lawsuit. The image was removed from library-issued copies of the album.) The album dealt with the theme of the male relationships in Tori's life, most notably her breakup with Eric Rossee, former record producer whom she had been involved with for nearly 7 years. (Pele is a Hawaiian volcano goddess to whom male sacrifices are made.) The album spawned hits with "Caught A Lite Sneeze" (which made history as the first song made available as a download on the internet by the recording industry), "Talula" (which was remixed by dance artist B.T. and included in the soundtrack to the film "Twister"), "Professional Widow," "In the Springtime of His Voodoo" and "Hey Jupiter." At this time Amos did something no one expected, and allowed her music to be remixed and released to dance clubs. The song "Professional Widow," originally a rough, punkish harpsichord dirge about Courtney Love and her involvement in husband Kurt Cobain's death, became a huge smash dance club hit when artist Armand Van Helden remixed it using only the lines "Honey, bring it close to my lips" and "It's Gotta be Big." The remix brought Amos her biggest hit yet, and propelled Van Helden to stardom although years later he would comment that he didn't receive a dime from the remix. Following that success, a remix of "In the Springtime of His Voodoo" was issued with lesser success. She also recollaborated with BT on a song called "Blue Skies." BT attended one of Tori's concert soundchecks and had her improvise the lyrics to the song, which he then mixed into a #1 dance hit. Amos, in the meantime, continued to rigorously tour the world. During her 1997 tour she took up a relationship with her sound engineer Mark Hawley, and suffered a miscarriage. In 1998 she released the album "From the Choirgirl Hotel," which dealt very strongly with her miscarriage and the idea of loss. The album was her most accessible since "Little Earthquakes," and even more radio friendly. It was also her first venture with a full rock band since "Y Kant Tori Read" in 1988. However mainstream the album's sound was, with rock influence, and even a full on techno song ("Hotel"), the lyrics remained cryptic as ever. The album artwork featured Amos in various wacky outfits, having been full-body scanned on a human sized photocopier. The album spawned the hit singles "Spark," "Cruel," "Raspberry Swirl," and "Jackie's Strength." The latter was remixed into a dance hit; it dealt with a young woman's reaction to the death of Jackie Kennedy and its relevance to her own wedding. The song "Raspberry Swirl" was nominated for a Grammy award for best alternative performance. The tour for the album was one of the most successful of the year. In 1998 Tori also toured with Alanis Morrissete, causing quite a stir among fans. Tori performed before Alanis, labeling her as the opening act, although it was a co-tour and the simple fact was that Tori HAD to perform first due to setting up and taking off her piano. In 1999 Tori released "To Venus and Back," a 2 CD set that featured one disc of 11 new songs and another disc of a sort of "greatest hits live" of performances from her 1998 tour. The disc did not perform as well as past efforts, although it spawned the hits "Bliss," "Concertina" and "1,000 Oceans." She toured to support the album with a full band. She also married her sound engineer, Mark Hawley. In the year 2000 Tori and Mark gave birth to their first child, Natashya Lorien Hawley. In 2001 Amos released "Strange Little Girls," an album of 12 cover songs. This album was a full-on concept album. Amos' goal was to re-interpret these songs, all written by male artists about female characters, from a female point of view. She created 13 female characters (one each for 11 songs plus a set of twins). She brought on longtime-colleague makeup artist Kevin Aucoin to create the characters and had photos taken of each. The songs on the album all deal with violence and men's views of women. She tackles such songs as "Happiness is a Warm Gun" by the Beatles from the point of view of the prostitute who visited John Lennon's assassin hours before the murder; "'97 Bonnie and Clyde" by Eminem from the point of view of the slaughtered and dying wife in the trunk of the car; and "Heart of Gold" from the point of view of twins involved in international espionage. As if all of this weren't enough, she also brought on legendary comic book and novel author Neil Gaiman to write short stories about each character, although they were reduced to simple quotes in the liner notes. The album was released with 4 different covers. Tori continues to make popular, interesting music on her own terms. Although she has participated in acting projects in the past (a "Kellog's Just Right" commercial and a guest role in the TV courtroom drama "Trial by Jury," both in the late 80s during her hair-metal phase), she doesn't seem in a hurry to keep it up.
      Her father is Methodist minister Dr. Rev. Edison Amos of Rockville, Maryland. His commentary on the second amendment is featured in sound clips on her song "Happiness is a Warm Gun" (a Beatles cover).
      Has received 7 Grammy nominations, sold close to 20 million albums worldwide (despite recieving little, if any mainstream airplay) and according to VH1, is the 77th greatest woman in rock n' roll history.
      Is good friends with Trent Reznor, who sang the background vocals on her song "Past the Mission" from her album "Under The Pink".
      Close friend of writer Neil Gaiman, who dedicated to her the character of "Delirium" in his comic saga "Sandman".
      She is famous for her skill to play covers of famous songs on the piano. Her first strike was the piano cover of "Smells Like Teen Spirit". At her concerts, there is always the Tori Amos Pianobar Moment, where she plays covers requested by her fans.
      Tori has stated that two of her maternal great-great-grandparents were Cherokee Native American (though all of her maternal great-grandparents were listed as "White" on United States censuses). Tori often has Native American influences in her songs, esp. on the album "Scarlet's Walk", which includes the song "Wampum Prayer", a tribute to Native Americans.
      Was offered the part of Sarah in The Crow: City of Angels (1996), but refused because she did not like the character. In an interview, she attributed the refusal of the role to the fact that the character had poor choice of footwear.
      1st May 2007: Released her ninth studio album: "American Doll Posse". It was written and produced by Tori at Martian Engineering in Cornwell, England, UK. The physical version was available in two different formats: the Standard Version and the Limited Edition CD/DVD Deluxe Version. The bonus DVD featured Behind The Scenes footage of the album photo shoot, an exclusive photo gallery, and the bonus track "My Posse Can Do". The Limited Edition version also included five collectible postcards, and a full color thirty six page booklet. Purchases from select independent retailers in the US, also came with a free 11"x26" Tori Amos lithograph.
      Recorded the song "Past the Mission" in the Beverly Hills mansion where Sharon Tate was murdered.
      Released her tenth studio album "Abnormally Attracted to Sin" on May 19th, 2009 with plans for a summer tour. [May 2009]
      Preparing to release her 9th studio album "American Doll Posse" in May 2007 and follow with a world tour. [March 2007]
      Touring solo (for the first time since 2001) in support of her new album "The Beekeeper" [April 2005]
      I know I'm an acquired taste: I'm anchovies. And not everyone wants those hairy little things. If I was potato chips, I could go more places.
      I just try to strip myself, peel myself like an onion. At different layers I discover stuff. I do it publicly, and if it helps to inspire somebody else, which inspires somebody else, we're talking about a really exciting world here.
      [after breast-feeding her daughter for the first time] An ounce of breast milk is even more potent then the finest tequila.
      [about the 9/11/01 terrorist attacks on New York] Don't you think it's really important now that there's a forum, that we're talking about all sides of what happened September 11 and what led up to it? We need to do some research; we need to think about, Why is the world where it is? It's so deep-rooted, if we really start looking, and we might not like what we find. But I think we have to, we have to ask the questions.
      In our minds, love and lust are really separated. It's hard to find someone that can be kind and you can trust enough to leave your kids with, and isn't afraid to throw her man up against the wall and lick him from head to toe.
      I'm beyond the fury of youth. I love young women who are angry. They're wild mustangs. But if you don't transcend that, you become a very disturbed 40-year-old.
      [on the piano] It plays me, really. I don't play it. There is a surrender to what the instrument is capable of it and I try to listen to it.
      [on her daughter] I didn't want her looking and hearing me and thinking, "Oh my God, that's a scary lady!"
      I see the dream and I see the nightmare, and I believe you can't have the dream without the nightmare.
      The whole Bible Belt banned me for "Crucify" because they thought I was being sacrilegious. They felt that it was detrimental material for their children and that it was blasphemous.
      I mean just 'cause you're a piano player, I think people just have an idea of what that is. They've decided they kinda' have you figured out.
      [on growing up as a minister's daughter] I was taught a belief system where there wasn't really any room to discover my own belief system.
      God is, "Hey buddy, I think you need a babe. Sit down. And I just happen to be around." The whole concept of God that our institutions have taught us, whatever it is, it's not just Christianity but the whole rigmarole, to me isn't what it truly is.
      My nightmares are so bad, that I mostly reject it when my friends want to take me to a cinema to watch a horror movie. Then I say, "No, thank you. I will dream in a few hours."
      When I sleep I often have nightmares. I can already hear your readers saying, "I knew that. The way your songs sound you must really have horrible nightmares."
      I don't know of anybody who's gonna be fulfilled if they get hit by a bus. You have to surrender to that eternal need to be fulfilled.
      There's room for everybody on the planet to be creative and conscious if you are your own person. If you're trying to be like someone else, then there isn't.
      I run into Pentecostals all the time . . . a lot of them are my friends, and they say, "Tori, I hope you find Jesus." I say, "How do you know I'm not having a margarita with Jesus tonight at 10 o'clock?"
      Let's be honest, religion has not supported women and men exploring all sorts of their sides, their unconscious. It has not been supportive of, you know, go into the places without shame, without blame, without judgment, and just let yourself really see what's cooking in there.
      Anyone can attend yoga, kabbalah classes, church, lectures by the 'Dalai Lama', yada, yada, yada - but can you be present for your life, and live with the way you treat other people?
      If you can hang around till you're 41 and not frighten people when you walk in the room, you're O.K.
      Seven years I would turn in tapes to record companies; after seven years of rejection of my own music, I believed them when they said, "This girl-at-her-piano thing is never gonna happen . . . Get a band, do metal, do dance, do whatever" - and I did them all. I had my limit of how much rejection I could take. I didn't believe in myself enough.
      It's all about draining you of your passion. That's what religion is about - cutting off the physical from the spiritual.
      When someone asks me if I've found Jesus, I say, "Yeah, I saw him at a Nirvana concert a couple of years ago." It's like, Jesus has got things to do, he's got a ten o'clock. He's not going to fix things for me, I have to fix things for myself, so I try and have a sense of humor about it and nobody finds my humor very amusing. We've just got to lighten up on the savior bit, folks. You know, get off the cross, we need the wood.
      I was supposed to be a concert pianist but I was more interested in what Stevie Wonder was doing.
      [on the aftermath of the 9/11 attack] I feel like our leaders have hijacked America's personality, and taken her to personality plastic surgery school. And they decided this is who she is.
      It's uncomfortable when I'm sitting down to a plate of spaghetti, when I'm having dinner and somebody wants to know all about the rape or all about "Professional Widow" and how I became an emotional vampire.
      It's a very humbling experience. I can't possess a song. The songs are like live entities for me. I have to put them out in the world, and it's none of my business what relationships the songs form. As an artist, I have to make peace with that.

In the US with its debut at #7, it marks the 8th time a Tori record has charted in the Top Ten on Billboard.
"When I spent time on tour with Tori Amos a decade ago, collaborating with her on a book, I'd see her invoke the four elements many nights before her band would take the stage. This was a focusing ritual, taken up to remind everyone that the process of making music is, metaphorically, part solid, skillful Earth; part responsive, adaptive Water; part imaginative Air; and part passionate Fire. Amos thinks in such deep structural terms, always considering how her compositions and performances come together from the underlying layers outward." - Read More

Tori has re-imagined a personally hand-picked collection of songs spanning her entire catalogue with the thirteenth studio album, Gold Dust.  Produced by Tori with arrangements by long-time collaborator John Philip Shenale, the new album features re-workings of songs in orchestral settings, which Tori recorded in the studio with the renowned Metropole Orchestra, conducted by Jules Buckley.
"My relationship with all of these songs has changed over the years and they have changed my life.  So it wasn't just about capturing the past it was about realizing that the songs had a new narrative now - 10 or 20 years later than they did when I originally recorded them," Tori comments.

On a cold December night in New York City, Tori Amos played a private solo concert for one hundred fans at the historic Park Avenue Armory, an immense historical landmark built in the late 19th century as both a military facility and a social club. Described as "Greek, Moresque, and Celtic with a dash of the Egyptian, the Persian, and the Japanese," the Armory's ornate Veterans Room provided a fitting setting for Tori's intimate performance.
Tori Amos: Live from the Artists Den captures this once-in-a-lifetime performance featuring both hits and fan favorites spanning Tori's catalogue, from her 1991 debut Little Earthquakes to her 2009 album Abnormally Attracted to Sin - including two songs not shown in the television broadcast.
Tori Amos is a founding member of and has been one of the main spokeswoman for The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), the nation's largest anti-sexual assault organization.  RAINN created and operates the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1.800.656.HOPE.  RAINN also publicizes the hotline's free, confidential services, educates the public about sexual assault, and leads national efforts to improve services to victims and ensure that rapists are brought to justice.

 An intimate, eye-opening look inside the life of one of the most unique and adored performers of contemporary rock musicFrom her critically acclaimed 1992 debut, Little Earthquakes, to the recent hit, Scarlet’s Walk, Tori Amos has been a formidable force in contemporary music, with one of the most dedicated fan bases in the industry. In Tori Amos: Piece by Piece, the singer herself takes readers beyond the mere facts, explaining the specifics of her creative process—how her songs go from ideas and melodies to recordings and passionately performed concert pieces. Written with acclaimed music journalist Ann Powers, Tori Amos: Piece by Piece is a firsthand account of the most intricate and intimate details of Amos’s life as both a private individual and a very public performing musician. In passionate and informative prose, Amos explains how her songs come to her and how she records and then performs them for audiences everywhere, all the while connecting with listeners across the world and maintaining her own family life (which includes raising a young daughter). But it is also much more, a verbal collage made by two strong female voices—and the voices of those closest to Amos—that calls upon genealogy, myth, and folklore to express Amos’s unique and fascinating personal history. In short, we see the pieces that make up—as Amos herself puts it—“the woman we call Tori.”With photos taken especially for this book by the photographer Loren Haynes, Tori Amos: Piece by Piece is a rare treat for both Tori listeners and newcomers alike, a look into the heart and mind of an extraordinary musician.I choose to fight my battles through my music . . . I was born a feminist. And then at age five, when my strict Christian grandmother punished me, I realized, I’m not penetrating here. I’m just pissing people off. So I had to find another way to penetrate. I had to redefine what that word means. That word now is really about an opening, an entering into a separate space. And after the first phase of my life, I realized that it was okay to enter that space without having to be invaded . . . I like the idea of just being able to be inside. Not using penetration as a violent word. The idea of being able to find keys . . . music, using keys to get into a space that we couldn’t before . . .Now, backstage at an undisclosed arena where the sweat of athletes is still perfuming my makeshift dressing room, my many conversations with Ann Powers have begun . . . “You come from the journalist side. I come from the artist side. It can become offensive. I’m sure from your side as well as from mine.” “Well, it’s true everyone expects us to be enemies. And in some ways we are. My job is interpretation. Yours is art, which often benefits from mystery . . .”Ann and I decided to strip our roles back to basics. We are both women born feminists in the 1960s. We are both married. We are both mothers. We are both in the music industry. Traditionally we are enemies. But for this project to be effective, I had to allow Ann to expose Tori Amos. And Tori Amos’s inner circle. And me.” – from the IntroductionBUY TORI AMOS’S LATEST RECORDING, THE BEEKEEPER, ON EPIC RECORDS

       After over a decade of making big-selling albums, but also being pigeonholed as an eccentric New Age princess, singer/songwriter Amos redefines her image in this appealing mishmash (coauthored with critic and Experience Music Project curator Powers) of her essays, quotes from her conversations with Powers and oral history observations from her band mates, husband, managers and friends. Readers may still find a few sprinklings of fairy dust in the proceedings, but Amos comes across as thoughtful, likable and witty, fully aware of her role as a female musician in the mainstream pop world yet determined to keep her work true to her spiritual and feminist perspectives. The book's structure lets Amos and Powers retain elements of a traditional biography--they candidly detail Amos's family history, her shaky entry into the music business, her relationships with formal religion and her multiple miscarriages before giving birth to her daughter--but it sidesteps a straightforward "this is my life" story line and lets Amos focus on how her experiences have shaped her songs. Powers and Amos also discuss practical issues about the music business and the roles female artists can take--or sometimes can't take--in controlling their public personae. With undoubted appeal to Amos's legion of fans, the book could offer additional interest to artists of all stripes, who may find reflections of their own experiences in hers. Illus.

       *Starred Review*   Amos' music is the stuff of legend, literally: haunting music paired with lyrics that often mix mythology with the deeply personal. Her first book is a series of conversations between herself and journalist Ann Powers, with contributions from the people closest to her, such as her husband and the members of her band. The conversations run the gamut:  Amos muses on everything from mythology and religion to songwriting to the hardships and joys of touring. But what really makes the book brilliant is Amos' interest in examining the roots of creativity and femininity. Her ruminations on creativity will resonate with any artist who has ever felt a kind of divine inspiration. Her observations about the challenge of the reconciling of the sexual and the sacred in women are equally astute.  Amos also reveals a great deal about her personal history and family influences, from the maternal grandfather who shared rich Cherokee stories with her to the paternal grandmother who sought to control Amos' behavior through religion.  Amos frankly discusses finding her own space and power in a world full of mixed messages and judgmental attitudes. Fans will also particularly enjoy the sections in which Amos analyzes the specific inspirations for several of her songs. Not just utterly engrossing, Amos' book is inspiring.

  Tori Amos is an amazing person.a.b.If you're a Tori fan, you'll love this book.Emily L. CnockaertThe book is well written and organized  2.Auston
This book records an ongoing dialog between musician/songwriter Tori Amos (Little Earthquakes) and rockumentarian Ann Powers (Weird Like Us: My Bohemian America, Women Write About Rock, Pop and Rap. Through a variety of conversations, Amos discusses her music, her personal life and the direction of her career.With sensual and stunning lyrics, Amos is a presence to be reckoned with, a young woman on the cusp of a great musical career with seven successful albums already to her credit. It would be a mistake to misinterpret Tori's passion as an expression of sexuality: "for her it's claiming her sexuality and merging it with her spirituality." Every performance is transformative, an expression of the immediacy of her emotions linked to the keyboard beneath her dancing fingers.Piece by Piece is an intriguing concept. Using a multi-part format, the authors draw from a number of sources, a collage of thoughts, past history and musical perceptions that give some idea of how involved the artist is with her work, her family, friends and life as a musician and songwriter. Every aspect of Amos' like is examined, the personal as well as the professional, because Amos uses all of her experience to inform her music, the passionate expression of a young woman with much to offer.  Amos imbues her work with the spirit of her soulful journey, cherishing her hard-one relationships with husband and child and the source of her creativity.Powers witnesses Amos' words, often expounding on the meanings in a broader context of artist in the world, adding another dimension to the musical achievement. Surprisingly complex, Piece by Piece brims with unexpected insights, musical interpretations and a view of the world through the eyes of an artist who is not intimidated by life.Read more ›
'Tori Amos Piece By Piece' (2005), co-written with Ann Powers, is an examination of the manifold motivators that have allowed Amos, perhaps the hardest working woman in popular music, to successfully blaze a definitive and firmly etched trail across the face of Western culture.As piercing, uncompromising, and deeply felt as the best of her musical compositions, the book is an outline of Amos' visionary philosophy as well as a testament of her personal and spiritual struggle. In no way a typical celebrity autobiography, 'Tori Amos Piece By Piece' may very well become a standard popular text and survival guide for all those at odds with the dominant and increasingly narrow "consensus reality" of the West.Though the book, which acknowledges a debt to Carl Jung, lacks the harrowing originality and claustrophobic focus of the Swiss psychologist's 'Memories, Dreams, and Reflections' (1961), it addresses some of the same ground in more brutally honest and plainly spoken language.Like Jung and Scottish novelist Muriel Spark, Amos is unapologetic in her belief that the human race is profoundly rooted in, and a continuous reflection and manifestation of, the Divine. Like those writers, Amos is both a student of and vocal witness to the active presence of Grace in human experience.Amos is a self-identified feminist, and the book consciously addresses women's spirituality and offers numerous practical examples of how Amos has applied her own female-centered belief system throughout her life.However, in the broadest sense, Amos' application of the myths of Demeter, Persephone, and other female deities seems to imply that these apply exclusively to women, when, clearly, the opposite is true.Read more ›
  You'd think the life of a talented famous musician would be easy and full of luxury.  While Tori enjoys her life, she works INCREDIBLY hard!!  She describes constantly writing songs, even if it's just a few words, or a few bars of melody.  She does this wherever she is.  Plus she deals with the record labels, the lawyers, the touring, the book writing, raising a daughter....She is an amazing woman; someone who sees the world and thinks about it differently than most.  Every song has a deep meaning to her, and she views them as "Sonic Beings" that she, the instrument, brings to the world.From the book, I can tell she is a good friend to everyone in her life.  She treats her crew as best as she can, and she gives her musicians the liberty to play as they feel, not as she commands.  She can also be tough as nails when there is something threatening her music or her tour.While, as a Christian, I may not agree with her theology, I found it so interesting how she drew power from various archetypes and "gods and goddesses".If you love Tori's music, and you want to know where it all comes from, and what circumstances in her life influenced it, you MUST read this book.  I couldn't put it down.  I finished it in 3 days.  Some paragraphs I read 4 or 5 times.Her last record label said she was getting "too old".  I hope she's still up there on stage, or at least putting out music when she's 80!!!
  As a fan of the music I really enjoyed Piece by Piece, but when I purchased it I did expect it to go a little deeper into her life than it did. Instead we got to understand her musical process, learn about how the music industry works and most interestingly, the story behind some of the songs.While I would have liked to learn a little more about her life, this book gives a deeper appreciation of the music she writes and allows the reader to understand the musical genius she really is.
      I'm a huge Tori fan!:) I've wanted this book for years and now I finally own it!:) the photos are spectacular!:) once I started reading this book I couldn't stop!
      Going beyond what is asked of the standard autobiography, the storytelling and opining in Piece by Piece is intimate and engaging...
      I've been skimming through the reviews on this book out of curiosity about how readers would receive such an atypical biography/autobiography.
      I adore this book. As a pagan woman who was raised in a Christian household, I can identify with Tori's seeking, questioning, and wonder regarding the sacred feminine.
      While I don't believe you have to be a mad Tori fan to appreciate this text, it's certainly a pleasure for those who are.
      Tori's oral narrative of her history, her family story, her personal struggles a few hearty laughs. A fun read!
      This book is helpful for any fan of Amos to understand the roots and foundation of her music. I enjoyed reading it and putting the pieces together!
      This was for the wife and she has read and read this as well as the other book Tori has put out.
      Tori Amos is an amazing person. The book is a glimpse inside her head.  It is purely phenominal the way she thinks, writes, and creates.
