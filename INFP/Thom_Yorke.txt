Thomas Edward "Thom" Yorke (born 7 October 1968) is an English musician, singer, and songwriter. He is the lead vocalist, lyricist, principal songwriter, guitarist and pianist of the bands Radiohead and Atoms for Peace, known for his falsetto singing style. As a multi-instrumentalist, he mainly plays guitar and piano, but also plays synthesizer, bass guitar, and drums among other instruments, and makes use of electronic equipment such as samplers and drum machines; later Radiohead albums credit him with playing "laptop". In the 1990s, Yorke was known as a rock musician, but the 2000 Radiohead album Kid A saw him expand into electronic music. In 2006, he released a solo album, The Eraser. Outside music, Yorke is notable as a political activist on behalf of human rights, environmentalist and anti-war causes.
In 2002, Q magazine named Yorke the sixth most powerful figure in music,[7] and Radiohead were ranked number 73 in Rolling Stone's "100 Greatest Artists of All Time" in 2005. In 2005, a poll organised by Blender and MTV2 saw Yorke voted the 18th greatest singer of all time,[8] and in 2008, he was ranked 66th in Rolling Stone's "100 Greatest Singers of All Time" list.[9]
Yorke was born on 7 October 1968, in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. Yorke's father, a nuclear physicist and later a chemical equipment salesman, was hired by a firm in Scotland shortly after his son's birth and the family lived there until Yorke was seven. He was born with a paralysed left eye, and underwent five eye operations by the age of six.[10] During this time Yorke had to wear a patch over his eye.[11] He has stated that the last surgery was "botched", giving him a drooping eyelid.[12]
Yorke's family moved frequently; Yorke moved from school to school, where classmates teased him for his eye.[13] The family finally settled in Oxfordshire in 1978.[13] Yorke received his first guitar when he was seven; his earliest musical inspiration was guitarist Brian May of Queen.[12][14] By 11, he had joined his first band and written his first song.[15] He attended the all-boys public school Abingdon in Oxford, where he met future band members Ed O'Brien, Phil Selway, and brothers Colin and Jonny Greenwood.[16] They formed a band named On a Friday, named for the only day they were allowed to rehearse.[12] In this early line-up, Yorke played guitar and sang. Speaking about music's influence on him as a schoolboy, Yorke said: "School was bearable for me because the music department was separate from the rest of the school. It had pianos in tiny booths, and I used to spend a lot of time hanging around there after school."[17]
After leaving school, Yorke took a gap year, during which he worked in a few jobs and was involved in a car accident that made him wary of any kind of mechanised transport; this informed the lyrics of several Radiohead songs, including the Bends B-side "Killer Cars" and "Airbag" from OK Computer.[18] In late 1988, Yorke left Oxford to study at the University of Exeter, which put On a Friday on hiatus aside from holiday break rehearsals.[19] At Exeter, Yorke worked as a DJ at Guild nights in the Lemon Grove and played with the band Headless Chickens.[20] He also met his partner Rachel Owen, and artist Stanley Donwood, with whom Yorke later collaborated to produce artwork for Radiohead albums and promotional material.[21]
On A Friday resumed activity in 1991 as the members were finishing their degree courses. They signed to Parlophone and changed their name to Radiohead. Around this time, Yorke said he "hit the self-destruct button pretty quickly"; he drank heavily, which resulted in him cutting his hair off and being too drunk to perform onstage.[22] Radiohead gained notice with the worldwide hit single "Creep", which later appeared on the band's 1993 debut album Pablo Honey. Yorke admitted later that the success had inflated his ego; he tried to project himself as a rock star, which included bleaching his hair and wearing extensions. He said, "When I got back to Oxford I was unbearable ... as soon as you get any success you disappear up your own arse and lost[sic] it forever."[23]
By the time of their second album, The Bends (1995), Radiohead had attracted a large fanbase and had begun to receive wider critical acclaim. After the album's release, the American rock band R.E.M. picked Radiohead as its opening act for the European leg of their tour.[24] During the tour, Yorke and R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe became close friends; Stipe gave him advice on how to deal with the demands of being in a famous rock band.[25] During the production of the band's third album, OK Computer (1997), all five members of Radiohead had differing opinions and equal production roles, with Yorke having "the loudest voice", according to guitarist Ed O'Brien.[26] OK Computer was heralded as a landmark album by nearly every publication that reviewed it, establishing Radiohead as one of the leading alternative rock acts of the 1990s. But Yorke was ambivalent about this success. Some of these concerns were voiced in the 1998 documentary film Meeting People Is Easy, which followed the band on their OK Computer tour. Yorke has explained that he dislikes the "mythology" of rock music and the media's obsession with celebrity.[27]
Yorke and the band adopted a more radical approach on 2000's Kid A and 2001's Amnesiac, processing vocals, obscuring lyrics, and departing from rock for a more varied musical landscape including electronic, jazz and avant-garde classical influences. The albums divided fans and critics, but were commercially successful, and later established wide critical acclaim; at the turn of the decade, Kid A was named the best album of the 2000s by Rolling Stone and Pitchfork.[28][29] In 2003, Radiohead released their sixth album, Hail to the Thief, a blend of rock and electronica that Yorke described as a reaction to the events of the early 2000s and newfound fears for his children's future, though he denied political intent. The band has continued to tour, and in 2005 they undertook recording sessions for a seventh album, In Rainbows, released as a digital DRM-free download in October 2007. In 2011, Radiohead released their eighth album, The King of Limbs, which Yorke described as "an expression of physical movements and wildness".
Yorke released his solo album The Eraser in 2006. Produced by Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich and featuring cover art by Stanley Donwood, it was released on the independent label XL Recordings. Yorke described the album as "more beats and electronics" and denied that it meant he was leaving Radiohead, saying, "I want no crap about me being a traitor or whatever splitting up blah blah... this was all done with their blessing."[30] The Eraser received positive reviews, and reached number 3 in the UK in its first week, number 2 in the United States, Canada and Australia, and number 9 in Ireland. It was nominated for a Mercury Prize a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.[citation needed] On 21 September 2009, Yorke released a new double-A side single, "Feeling Pulled Apart by Horses / The Hollow Earth".[31] In 2012, Yorke contributed music to a Rag & Bone fashion show.[32]
Yorke rarely plays as a solo act, and has never embarked on a solo tour. He has sometimes played short acoustic sets of Radiohead songs in the band's webcasts and television appearances, and occasionally on his own at rallies. In 2006, he performed stripped-down versions of several songs from The Eraser ("Analyse", "The Clock", "Skip Divided" and "Cymbal Rush") on radio and TV programmes, has performed "Cymbal Rush" as an encore at some Radiohead concerts. In July 2009, Yorke played a solo performance at the Latitude Festival in England.[33]
In 2009, Yorke formed Atoms for Peace to perform songs from his solo album The Eraser. Alongside Yorke on vocals, guitar and keyboards, the band comprises bassist Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, drummer Joey Waronker of Beck and R.E.M., percussionist Mauro Refosco of Forro in the Dark and Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich on keyboards and guitar.[34] In February 2013, Atoms for Peace released their debut album, Amok, to positive reviews.[35][36] Answering a fan question on Reddit, Yorke wrote that determining whether new songs were for Radiohead or Atoms for Peace was "a grey area. getting greyer. obviously depends on who is being sampled."[37]

Yorke has worked with producer Nigel Godrich on every Radiohead album since The Bends, as well as his solo album The Eraser and the Atoms for Peace album Amok. Beyond production and engineering roles, Godrich helps Yorke arrange and edit his songs. Describing their collaborative process, Godrich said: "I know, from years of experience, that what he does is he just bats things around, and comes up with fragments of things. They usually find a context in time."[38] Yorke said: "[The Eraser song] 'Black Swan', back in the day, was a six-minute load of crap. Except for this one juicy bit, and [Godrich] goes past and goes, 'That bit. Fuck the rest.' Usually it's something like that."[38]
Yorke has worked with artist Stanley Donwood to create the cover art for every Radiohead album since The Bends, as well as The Eraser and Amok. The two met as art students at the University of Exeter.[39] Yorke wrote: "I met him first day at art college and he had a better hat and suit on than me. That pissed me off. So I figured I'd either end up really not liking this person at all, or working with him for the rest of my life."[37] Donwood said his first impression of Yorke was that he was "mouthy. Pissed off. Someone I could work with."[40] Yorke is credited alongside Donwood under the monikers "The White Chocolate Farm", "Dr. Tchock", "Tchocky" or similar abbreviations.
Yorke has collaborated with several musical artists outside Radiohead and Atoms for Peace. For the 1998 film Velvet Goldmine, Yorke formed Venus in Furs with Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood, Suede's Bernard Butler, and Roxy Music's Andy Mackay, and recorded covers of the Roxy Music songs "2HB", "Ladytron" and "Bitter-Sweet". In the same year, he co-wrote "Rabbit in Your Headlights" with DJ Shadow, which appears on the UNKLE album Psyence Fiction, and dueted on "El President" with Isabel Monteiro of Drugstore. In 2000, Yorke duetted with PJ Harvey on "This Mess We're In" and contributed backing vocals to "One Line" and "Beautiful Feeling" for her Mercury Prize-winning album Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea. In the same year, he appeared on Bj√∂rk's soundtrack album Selmasongs, singing on the Oscar-nominated song "I've Seen It All". Yorke and Bj√∂rk worked together again in 2008 on the charity single "N√°tt√∫ra". In 2009, Yorke recorded a cover of the Mark Mulcahy song "All for the Best" with his brother Andy for the compilation Ciao My Shining Star: The Songs of Mark Mulcahy.
Yorke has provided vocals for two tracks by the electronic musician Flying Lotus: "...And the World Laughs with You" from Cosmogramma (2010) and "Electric Candyman" from Until the Quiet Comes (2012), and three tracks by the German electronic act Modeselektor: "The White Flash" from Happy Birthday (2007), and "Shipwreck" and "This" from Monkeytown (2011). He has also contributed music and production in collaborations with electronic and hip-hop artists including Modeselektor, Burial, Four Tet and MF DOOM.
Yorke lives in Oxford with his partner, Rachel Owen, whom he met at university. Owen studied fine art printmaking at Exeter and painting at the Accademia di Belle Arti of Florence, and completed a PhD at the University of London researching the illustrations to Dante's Divine Comedy.[41] She and Yorke have two children, son Noah, born in 2001, and daughter Agnes, born 2004. Yorke's only sibling, brother Andy, is the singer of the band Unbelievable Truth.[citation needed]
Yorke has had an uneasy relationship with other celebrities and the media. Following Radiohead's 1993 Pablo Honey tour of America, Yorke became disenchanted at being "right at the sharp end of the sexy, sassy, MTV eye-candy lifestyle" he felt he was helping to sell to the world.[42] The 1998 documentary film Meeting People Is Easy portrays Yorke's disaffection with the music industry and press during the 1997-8 "Against Demons" world tour.[43]
As a singer, Yorke is recognisable by his distinctive tenor voice, vibrato, frequent use of falsetto and ability to reach, and sustain notes over a wide vocal range. In 1994, the band watched Jeff Buckley in concert; Yorke later said the concert had a direct effect on his vocal delivery on "Fake Plastic Trees".[44] However, Yorke has said, "It annoys me how pretty my voice is... how polite it can sound when perhaps what I'm singing is deeply acidic."[45] He has often adopted other styles of singing, such as an aggressive shouting style in the middle section of "Paranoid Android" and a semi-spoken style for 2003's "Myxomatosis" and "A Wolf at the Door".
Aside from vocal duties and writing lyrics, Yorke's musical contributions to Radiohead include guitar, both acoustic and electric (usually rhythm, with band member Jonny Greenwood handling lead), piano, including Rhodes piano, and synthesizers. He also plays bass guitar on occasion (the bass lines for "The National Anthem" and "Pyramid Song" were recorded by him) and live with Radiohead he plays bass on the b-side "The Amazing Sounds of Orgy". At solo shows and with his band "Atoms for Peace", he would play bass for "Harrowdown Hill" from his album The Eraser. He is also capable of playing drums; during the 2006 and 2008 tours he performed percussion on stage in tandem with drummer Phil Selway on the track "Bangers + Mash".
Yorke, unlike the other members of Radiohead, has never learned how to read music.[46] He said, "If someone lays the notes on a page in front of me, it's meaningless... because to me you can't express the rhythms properly like that. It's a very ineffective way of doing it, so I've never really bothered picking it up."[45]
Since Kid A, Radiohead, and in particular Yorke, have incorporated many elements of electronic music into their work. As a result, Yorke has taken an increased role in programming beats and samples and has been credited with playing "laptop" on recent albums. On a radio show in 2003 to publicise the release of Hail to the Thief, Yorke remarked that he would rather make a record just with a computer than with only an acoustic guitar.[47] His solo effort The Eraser featured piano, bass and guitar, but was built primarily around electronics.
In interviews Yorke has cited a variety of personal musical heroes and influences, including jazz composer and bassist Charles Mingus, Neil Young, Miracle Legion, singer Scott Walker, electronic acts Aphex Twin and Autechre, and Krautrock band Can. Talking Heads, Queen, Joy Division, Magazine, Elvis Costello, The Smiths and Sonic Youth were early influences on Radiohead and Yorke. In 2004, at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Yorke mentioned to the crowd, "When I was in college, the Pixies and R.E.M. changed my life",[48] and he has often mentioned both bands as influential examples. He is also an admirer of Icelandic singer Bj√∂rk; he called her song "Unravel" his favourite song ever, claiming "I'm trying to get Radiohead to do a cover because I think it's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard." In November 2007, the band covered the song as part of a live webcast.[49]
Yorke has been outspoken on various contemporary political and social issues. Radiohead had read No Logo by Naomi Klein during the Kid A sessions ("No Logo" was also briefly considered as the album title) and all the members were reportedly heavily influenced by it, though Yorke said it "didn't teach him anything he didn't already know".[50] Yorke's activism in support of fair trade practices, with an anti-WTO and anti-globalisation stance, garnered significant attention in the early 2000s.[51] Yorke had previously referenced maquiladoras in the title of a Radiohead B-side in 1995, and decried the International Monetary Fund in 1997's "Electioneering". Yorke is also a professed fan of Noam Chomsky's political writings,[52] and is a vegetarian.[53]
Yorke is also notable as a political activist on behalf of human rights, environmentalist and anti-war causes including Jubilee 2000, Amnesty International and CND, the Green Party of England and Wales, and Friends of the Earth's Big Ask campaign.[54] Radiohead played at the Free Tibet concert in both 1998 and 1999, and at an Amnesty International concert in 1998.[55] In 2005, Yorke performed at an all-night vigil for the Trade Justice Movement.[56] In 2006, Jonny Greenwood and Yorke performed a special benefit concert for Friends of the Earth. Yorke made headlines the same year for refusing prime minister Tony Blair's request to meet with him to discuss climate change, declaring Blair had "no environmental credentials".[57] Yorke has subsequently been critical of his own energy use. He has said the music industry's use of air transport is dangerous and unsustainable, and that he would consider not touring if new carbon emissions standards do not force the situation to improve.[58] Radiohead commissioned a study by the group Best Foot Forward which the band claims helped them choose venues and transport methods that will greatly reduce the carbon expended on their 2008 tour. The band also made use of a new low-energy LED lighting system and encouraged festivals to offer reusable plastics.[59]
In December 2009, Yorke gained access to the COP 15 climate change talks in Copenhagen, posing as a member of the media.[60] In the same year he lent his support to the 10:10 project, a movement encouraging people to take positive action on climate change by reducing their carbon emissions.[61]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,‚Äô Calls Suit ‚ÄòPreposterous‚Äô
          Thom Yorke was born on October 7, 1968 in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, England as Thomas Edward Yorke.
      Supplied his voice to the film Velvet Goldmine (1998). His voice is used as Brian Slade's in two of the songs performed in the film. In Bittersweet and 2HB, both Roxy Music covers.
      In February 2001, girlfriend Rachel Owens gave birth to Thom's first child, Noah. Daughter Agnes born October 2004.
      Most Radiohead songs originate with his melodies and ideas which are then expanded upon by him and the rest of the band.
      The Radiohead albums 'The Bends' (1995) and 'OK Computer' (1997) are considered seminal works of the 1990s. Yorke is the band's lead singer, guitarist/keyboardist, and songwriter.
      Thom has had surgery multiple times on his left eye since childhood. None of them have worked completely (obviously).
      Radiohead's 1997 album "OK Computer" came 17th in Classic Rock Magazine's list of the 30 greatest concept albums of all time. [March 2003]
      Radiohead albums: "Pablo Honey", "The Bends", "Ok Computer", "Kid A", "Amnesiac", "Hail to the Thief", "In Rainbows" and "The King of Limbs".
Marillion are fans of Radiohead and in 1998 they covered Radiohead's song "Fake Plastic Trees" for their live album "Unplugged at the Walls".
      His album "Hail to the Thief" was bootlegged two months prior to its release, which is a record. Despite suggestions to release the album earlier to counteract against piraters, it was released at the scheduled time and hit number 2 of the charts, which proves that major bootlegging did not drastically affect an album's success.
      Radiohead's album OK Computer was in 2005 voted by viewers of Channel 4 as the greatest album of all time.
      New album "In Rainbows" was released in 2007, employing a new method of distribution: the record is only available from www.Radiohead.com, and the fans can pick the price. Traditional CD release expected next year, in early 2008.
      People are born with certain faces, like my father was born with a face that people want to hit.
      I'm not afraid of computers taking over the world. They're just sitting there. I can hit them with a two by four.
      I can be very drunk in a club in Oxford on a Monday night and some guy comes up to you and buys you a drink and says that the last record you made changed his life. That means something.
      People in bands don't have the kind of conversations people might think they have. The best things about being in a band are the things that are unsaid. You click together in the studio or whatever and that's enough to make you feel close to each other. There are no long nights of bonding where you tell each other your innermost fears.
      Well, they're bound to, aren't they? It wasn't their fucking idea, was it? Ultimately, it's quite funny because I distinctly remember when "OK Computer" came out and you had people going, 'Yeah, but it's not "The Bends" is it? It's got all this weird stuff on it.' 'Why are they being weird? Why can't they just be normal?' F*** it. It's just nostalgia. It's like telling painters how to paint. It's not my problem.
      We have to stop the oil giants pushing into the Arctic. An oil spill in the Arctic would devastate this region of breath-taking beauty, while burning that oil will only add to the biggest problem we all face, climate change.
      [on Atoms for Peace] It's been a weird build-up because in calling it not me - in calling it another thing - people don't necessarily make the connection, which is kind of mad. So it's been sort of like starting again with a band a trying to say to people, "This is this thing." And then I can't really explain it either because it's not really a band.
      You just can't take anything for granted - and I'm glad I haven't taken anything from granted because it's sort of like putting on a brand-new face and still expecting people to recognize you. That's how it's felt. And it's an odd situation to just sort of start again without the big Radiohead flag, which guarantees this insane level of scrutiny. It's nice to take it off, but it sort of throws you a bit as well.

Radiohead were one of the most innovative and provocative bands of the 1990s and 2000s, five very serious Englishmen guys who developed their own sound and always tried really, really hard. The band, who were also the biggest art-rock act since Pink Floyd, began as purveyors of a swooning, from-the-gut sound that Alicia Silverstone aptly labeled as ‚Äúcomplaint rock‚Äù in the film Clueless. But albums like 1997‚Äôs space-rock opera OK Computer and 2000‚Äôs slippery, is-this-even-rock? Kid A (which was Rolling Stone‚Äôs album of the decade for the 2000s) were game-changers‚Äîfuture-shock opuses that showed off shadowy, meticulously constructed electronic textures and inspired thousands of imitators, none of whom had Radiohead‚Äôs talents.
Born in 1968, singer Thom Yorke formed his first band at the age of 10 despite admittedly having few friends. An abnormality in his left eye made Yorke the victim of teasing in his childhood, with Yorke telling Rolling Stone in 1995 that he often got into fights with his peers. These youthful experiences no doubt contributed to Yorke's antisocial and confrontational lyrics.
In 1985, Yorke met two of his future bandmates at the boys-only Abingdon School and the seeds of Radiohead were planted: Guitarist Ed O' Brien (recruited because Yorke thought he looked like Morrissey) and bassist Colin Greenwood (recruited because he dressed weird and went to lots of parties, Yorke told RS.) Drummer Phil Selway joined soon after, and Greenwood's younger brother Jonny rounded out the lineup, first as harmonica player, then as keyboardist and finally, as guitarist. After parting ways to attend university, the group, then named On a Friday, reconvened to record a series of demo tapes including one called Manic Hedgehog, which caught the ear of EMI in 1991 during the wave of grunge fever. The label promptly signed the group to a six-album deal but requested they changed their moniker. Thus, in 1992, On a Friday became Radiohead, named after a Talking Heads song that appeared on that band's True Stories.
Radiohead's debut EP Drill was released in 1992. Heavily inspired by the Pixies at this time, a group Yorke would champion as one of the greatest ever, the EP featured four songs, three of which would appear on the band's debut 1993 album Pablo Honey. Titled after a Jerky Boys skit, Pablo Honey featured the smash hit "Creep," a song that remains Radiohead's most lasting and successful single even though they've all but disowned Pablo Honey in the shadow of their later work. With Yorke's Kurt Cobain hair, its depressing story about unrequited love and the way "Creep" borrowed the Pixies' loud-quiet-loud aesthetics, many were quick to bunch Radiohead in with the overgrowing pool of Nirvana rip-offs, another one-hit wonder from the other side of the Atlantic plundering Nevermind for instant and fleeting fame.
1995's The Bends proved that Radiohead was no one hit wonder: With its mix of sonic guitar anthems and striking ballads, the band's second album was critically applauded immediately, and Radiohead were elevated above their Brit pop peers on the strength of songs like "My Iron Lung," "High and Dry" and "Fake Plastic Trees." Yorke's lyrics now began to paint a more haunted landscape, with themes of sickness, consumerism, jealousy and longing. While no singles scraped the heights of "Creep," The Bends was a smash success in the U.K. and wound up selling well in the U.S. The music on The Bends was so potent and fresh that bands like Coldplay and Muse, two Brit rock groups directly influenced by Radiohead's second album, would go on to enjoy multi-platinum fame by adhering to its blueprint.
The Bends would also mark the beginning of a pair of collaborations with important ancillary members of the Radiohead family that would continue until this day. Nigel Godrich, an engineer on The Bends, would go on to serve as Radiohead's fulltime producer, a fortuitous partnership that has deservedly drawn similarities to George Martin's relationship with the Beatles. The Bends was also the first Radiohead album to don the artwork of Stanley Donwood, an Exeter College friend of Yorke's whose own artwork seemed to mature visually at the same pace as the band's sound was maturing aurally. On Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time, The Bends placed at Number 110.
The success of The Bends scored Radiohead gigs opening for Alanis Morissette‚Äîwith the band using that trek to road test tracks for their third album‚Äîand R.E.M. Yorke and R.E.M's Michael Stipe became friends while their two bands on the road, and the whole experience would go on to influence the trajectory of the band's career. "We were a different band after we toured with R.E.M.," Ed O'Brien told Rolling Stone in 1997. "They did it their own way, and we spoke about that as the way that we wanted to do it: go out there and gig, and win a few more people over on each album." A collection of B-sides from The Bends were released as the My Iron Lung EP, and the track "Talk Show Host" would appear on the soundtrack for the film Romeo + Juliet. While not on the soundtrack, the end credits song from that film was another new Radiohead composition called "Exit Music (For a Film)," a track inspired by William Shakespeare's tragedy that would reappear a year later on Radiohead's third album.
"Everyone said, 'You'll sell 6 or 7 million if you bring out The Bends, Part 2, " O'Brien told RS in 1997, "And we're like, 'Yeah, right.' But we're not going to do that. The one thing you don't want to say to us is what we should do, because we'll kick against that and do exactly the opposite.‚Äù Gone were the introspective Brit pop anthems, in their place something bleaker, atmospheric and more sophisticated. OK Computer's dozen songs touch on paranoia, the repetitive minutiae of suburban life, alien abduction, car crashes, plane crashes and the foreboding computer age.
In just four years, Radiohead had gone from "Creep" to OK Computer's lead single "Paranoid Android," a six-and-a-half minute multi-part epic that drew comparisons to everything from Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody" to the Beatles to prog-rock. Two more singles from the album got heavy airplay, "Karma Police" and "No Surprises," and the success of OK Computer both critically and commercially‚Äîthe LP would hit Number One on the U.K. Album Charts‚Äîjettisoned Radiohead to global fame. The wears of the ensuing tour and Yorke's almost inability to adapt to this new popularity was documented in the film Meeting People is Easy.
After the monumental success of OK Computer, expectations were unfathomably high for Radiohead's fourth album. With Yorke suffering from writer's block and the band divided over what direction their music should take‚Äîwhether to return to rock or go further off the deep end‚ÄîRadiohead once again teamed with producer Nigel Godrich to begin recording Kid A in 1999. With Kid A, Radiohead took OK Computer, dismantled it down to its motherboard, added technology both cutting edge and antiquated and rebuilt it all as an actual paranoid android. Radiohead's most recognizable instrument had always been Yorke's unique voice, but Kid A intentionally rendered his vocals mechanized and mutilated. Gone was the tender and elegiac voice that serenaded listeners on "High and Dry" and "Exit Music (For a Film)"; in its place was something distant, alien and largely inhuman.
The presence of guitars, the supplier of the riffs that brought Radiohead's worldwide fame on their previous albums, was minimal on Kid A, and when they did emerge that were severely treated. Throughout Kid A, Jonny Greenwood used one of the earliest electronic instruments, the ondes Martenot, in new ways, and it's fitting that on Kid A's centerpiece and most revolutionary track, the apocalyptic disco of "Idioteque," the band sampled Paul Lansky's "Mild Un Leise," an innovative computer-born piece of 1970s electronic music. On Kid A, Radiohead looked back at all the music that inspired them‚Äîrock, jazz, dance, classical, electronic, avant-garde, Krautrock‚Äîthrew all those influences in a shredder and rearranged them piece-by-piece to form music for a new millennium. "I find it difficult to think of the path we've chosen as 'rock music,'" Yorke told Rolling Stone in his only American Kid A-era interview. "Kid A is like getting a massive eraser out and starting again."
It's ironic that songs from an album so intent on being listened to as a singular work of art would leak individually and out of order in the early days of Napster, making Kid A one of the first albums to prematurely appear on the file-sharing program, a problem that would later cripple the record industry. Even though Napster conspired against the way Kid A was meant to be heard, Radiohead became one of the first bands to embrace the Internet as a promotional tool, posting brief snippets of Kid A songs to whet the appetite of fans.
As Kid A yielded no music videos, singles or interviews from the band, these little "blips" were all the band did to promote their album; in fact, the positive word of mouth circulating around the Kid A leak helped create more prerelease buzz than any video or single could have. Despite no singles, no videos and an album that was readily available for free to anyone with access to a high-speed cable modem, Kid A debuted at Number One on the Billboard album charts upon its release.
The sessions for Kid A were rumored to have produced enough songs for two full albums, so when Radiohead began playing new songs while touring in support of Kid A, it seemed like fans wouldn't have to wait long for the band's next LP. And they didn't, as Amnesiac arrived in June 2001, just eight months after Kid A, with a more conventional release complete with singles and music videos.
Mistakenly dismissed as an inferior Kid B before its release, Amnesiac did approach many of the similar themes of its older brother, as evidenced by the redux "Morning Bell/Amnesiac." The sweeping, mournful "Pyramid Song," Amnesiac's first single, ranks among Radiohead's most beloved songs, and second single "Knives Out" was the closest thing the band's later output came to The Bends. Amnesiac also produced the anthemic "You And Whose Army?," the orchestral dub of "Dollars and Cents" and the jazz band closer "Life in a Glass House," plus sonic experiments in the form of "Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors" and "Like Spinning Plates." The album's one true rocker, "I Might Be Wrong," served as the foundation for an EP that showcased the band's stunning stage show, 2001's I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings, which proved that Radiohead was still a marquee rock band onstage.
While touring in the summer of 2002, Radiohead premiered another dozen new songs onstage. These tracks provided the backbone for the band's next album, 2003's Hail to the Thief. More song-minded and tuneful than its predecessors, the first sound the listener hears on HTTT opener "2+2=5" is the sound of a guitar being plugged into an amp, signifying the album would be a slight return to the rock Radiohead all but abandoned on their previous two albums. The album was also a reflection of the gloomy state of affairs in the post-9/11 world; George W. Bush's America was marching hand-in-hand into Iraq with the United Kingdom and all the paranoia of Yorke's earlier lyrics suddenly seemed justified. Among the highlights on Hail to the Thief were the Grammy-nominated "There There," a Can-inspired single paced by a thunderous army of drums, the rock-oriented second single "Go to Sleep" and "A Wolf at the Door," a foreboding album closer that Yorke delivers so frenetically it borders on hip-hop. A collection of Hail-era B-sides and remixes were released on the COM LAG EP in 2004, and after releasing three critically acclaimed albums in the span of three years, Radiohead went on hiatus to begin work on solo projects.
Yorke, more fascinated with music born out of computers than guitars, finally placated all his electronic yearnings on his debut solo album The Eraser, released in July 2006. A departure from Radiohead's work but still distinctively Yorke, the album was received warmly by both critics and fans. It wouldn't be until October 2009 that Yorke would finally bring Eraser tracks to a live setting, teaming with Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea and Godrich for a band named "????". Yorke's side project was enlisted to perform at the 2010 Coachella Festival. Meanwhile, Greenwood and his continued mastery of the ondes Martenot were drafted to score director Paul Thomas Anderson's Oscar-nominated film There Will Be Blood. In his first true attempt as film composer, Greenwood's score earned rave reviews.
Recording on the band's seventh album began in mid-2005 through early-2006, but the band grew frustrated with what was coming out of those sessions. For the first time since Pablo Honey, Radiohead tried working without the aid of Nigel Godrich, adding Mark "Spike" Stent for the embryonic stages of the recording. By April 2006, however, Stint was relieved of his duties and Godrich was reinstated.
Taking what they worked on during those early sessions, Radiohead crafted their new songs during a tour in the summer of 2006, including the band's now-historic headlining performance at Bonnaroo that boasted many of the tracks that would later appear on their next album. After perfecting the new songs on the road, a refocused and reinvigorated Radiohead reentered the studio in 2006. A year later, the band's official Website Dead Air Space would sporadically come alive with veiled messages, decoded as gibberish. Still, it was apparent that the gears were turning on the Radiohead front. Then, on October 1st, 2007, a message on the Radiohead Website read: "Well, the new album is finished, and it's coming out in 10 days...We've called it In Rainbows."
Six albums into their career and on the verge of their seventh, Radiohead finally found them in a position they hadn't been in since before Pablo Honey, as the band's record contract with EMI expired following HTTT. "If the major labels had their shit together about the Internet‚Ä¶ They've been sticking their heads in the sand over new technology," Yorke told Rolling Stone in 2000 as the record industry struggled to adapt to Napster and the digital medium. "They reaped some pretty bad karma doing that, and now they're paying the consequences." Free of their record contract, the stage was set for the band's riskiest masterstroke to date with the 2007 release of In Rainbows.
In a move that would revolutionize how artists would distribute their music, Radiohead offered up In Rainbows by allowing people to pay what they wanted for a digital copy of the album, thus letting the fans decide what the music was worth to them. The theory was, since all of their albums since Kid A had leaked prior to its release‚Äîincluding Hail to the Thief in an unmastered form‚Äîthey'd leak the complete album the way it was meant to be heard themselves while essentially putting a digital tip jar on the album's official website. The majority opted to download In Rainbows for free, but the band later revealed that the In Rainbows experiment did more for their own pocketbooks means than the release of their previous albums.
In addition to the "pay-what-you-want" approach, which was both applauded and criticized but was inarguably an industry-changer, Radiohead also offered up a "disc-box" version of In Rainbows, a physical release that included and a bonus disc sporting eight additional songs from the In Rainbows sessions. Despite being distributed for free legally and illegally‚Äîpeer-to-peer downloads of In Rainbows reportedly eclipsed legal downloads‚Äîthe album still reached Number One on the Billboard 200 when it was physically released on CD on January 1st, 2008. In Rainbows itself was Radiohead's most lush and accessible LP since OK Computer, and introduced the band to a whole new generation of fans. Radiohead toured in support of In Rainbows throughout 2008.
2009 brought a pair of new Radiohead recordings, the charity single "Harry Patch (In Memory Of)" and a free download of an IR leftover "These Are My Twisted Words." Thom Yorke also released a 12'' single with two new tracks "The Hollow Earth" and "Feeling Pulled Apart By Horses" and also contributed the song "Hearing Damage" to the Twilight: New Moon soundtrack. In early 2010, Radiohead began work on their follow-up to In Rainbows.

The perpetually haunted voice of Radiohead reserved his solo billing for further electronics and beats experimentation.
=======================================================
Few rock singers of the '90s were as original and instantly unforgettable as Thom Yorke, as his band, Radiohead, became one of the biggest bands of the 21st century after making a career out of specializing in challenging and unpredictable rock. Born October 7, 1968, in Wellingborough, England, Yorke was born with a vision ailment: his left eye was paralyzed and shut until the age of six. He underwent a total of five operations; the last operation was botched and he almost lost all sight out of that eye (only after wearing an eye patch for a year was he able to see, albeit slightly). His family moved often since his father worked as a chemical engineering instruments salesman, and by his teens, he had turned to music as an inspiration, namely Elvis Costello, Queen, and the Beatles. After his family finally settled down in Oxford, Yorke was sent to an all-boys school, where he first met future Radiohead guitarist Ed O'Brien and bassist Colin Greenwood, soon after discovering such '80s alternative bands as the Smiths, R.E.M., and the Cure. The seeds of what would eventually become Radiohead were planted at this point, as the trio jammed with a drum machine before replacing it with another friend, drummer Phil Selway, and inviting Greenwood's younger multi-instrument playing brother Jonny to join up, too.  
The group's original name was On a Friday, before being changed to Radiohead, which they'd swiped from the title of a song on Talking Heads' True Stories. By late 1991, the band was signed to Parlophone in the U.K. and Capitol in the U.S., as an EP, "Drill," came and went without much fanfare. 1993's full-length debut, Pablo Honey, appeared to be suffering the same fate, until American radio/MTV made a surprise hit out of the Nirvana-esque alt-anthem "Creep." The band's fan base grew considerably over the course of their next two releases, 1995's The Bends and 1997's OK Computer, the latter being voted Greatest Album of All Time in the British magazine Q shortly after its release. One of the world's top rock bands by this time, the group attempted to alienate their newly found Top 40 audience with their next release, 2000's abstract Kid A, but instead found it debuting at the top of the U.S. charts (despite the absence of a video or single being released from the album).  
While Radiohead remains his top priority, Yorke has also found the time to guest on other band's recordings as well. Some of these "cameo" appearances include the songs "El President" by Drugstore (off the album White Magic for Lovers), a cover of Pink Floyd's "Wish You Were Here" with Sparklehorse, "Rabbit in Your Headlights" by UNKLE (Psyence Fiction), Bj√∂rk's "I've Seen It All" (Selmasongs), and PJ Harvey's "This Mess We're In" (Stories from the Cities). Yorke has also appeared as part of the ad hoc alternative supergroup Venus in Furs for the soundtrack to the 1998 glam rock film Velvet Goldmine, lending his vocals to the tracks "2HB," "Ladytron," and "Bitter-Sweet." In May 2006, he unleashed a surprise by announcing an imminent solo album on Radiohead's weblog. The Eraser, made with extensive assistance from Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, was released on XL in July. ~ Greg Prato, Rovi

Is it worth the constrained time you have to hand it above to stress so it can mess up even alot more of your time that you say you dont waste on ineffective matters in the to start with site? 
‚ÄúThom Yorke: Radiohead & Trading Solo‚Äù is the title of the forthcoming biography of Thom Yorke. The book will hit the shelves next month.
There are already many Radiohead books out there, but publisher Independent Music Press announced this first ever biography of the Radiohead frontman. The press release claims that the 208 page book, written by Trevor Baker, is ‚Äúa tale of the extraordinary drive, ambition and perfectionism of just one man. Thom Yorke‚Äôs story has never been told and this biography goes further and deeper than ever before with the help of in-depth interviews from former classmates, producers, video makers and other key players in his life.‚Äù
Seems kind of strange for a biography of such a private person to be published while he‚Äôs still alive, kicking, and in the public eye.
Thom Yorke is one of the most important musicians in modern culture. His influence is vast. He deserves a legitimate, engrossing, authorized biography. Thom Yorke: Radiohead & Trading Solo is not that biography.
This is going to be such a fetid heap of garbage.  Yes, let me hear about the ‚Äúreal‚Äù Thom Yorke as told by classmates of his dating back two decades and the on-site medic for the Karma Police video shoot.  As said earlier, Thom is a very private individual (who does not appear to have sanctioned this effort or cooperated in any way) and so I imagine most of the contents of the book will emanate from rehashed interview clips, speculation, and pop psychology.  The man is still ascendant in his career, why write the biography now ‚Äì except as an effort to cash in?  
Also queer that the blurb for the book seems to describe Thom as a man of unbridled ambition and a perfectionist.  This, about the man who famously sings ‚Äúambition makes you look pretty ugly‚Äù and ‚Äúyou can try the best you can, the best you can is good enough.‚Äù
‚ÄúThom Yorke‚Äôs story has never been told and this biography goes further and deeper than ever before‚Äù
Unauthorized biographies are legal though if inaccurate the author can be liable.  I hope there are tons of books on Thom and each member of Radiohead now and in the future.  Would like a great biographer such as James Atlas or Alex Ross to do a book or five.
it‚Äôll be exciting to read those spoiled lil exceter classmates opinioning on him, and I look forward to their anecdotes!
What was the name of that unauthorized dvd one from years back? ‚ÄúHomework‚Äù or something? I bet it will be as bad as that was.
Not interested unless the book is titled ‚ÄòThom Yorke: The Autobiography of Thom Yorke. By Thom Yorke.‚Äô
Most people who matter don‚Äôt write autobiographies, so stop holding your breath for a bio by Thom himself.
I‚Äôd be interested to give it a look, see what those former classmates have to say.  But I‚Äôm embarrassed for Thom whenever I see him in his bleached blonde hair, so I‚Äôm not sure I want to delve back that far.  I‚Äôm more interested in album production and the stories behind the songs.
hmmm kind of interested in reading it though.  But I get how it won‚Äôt be as exact as an autobiography. I agree, I don‚Äôt see Thom ever writing his own
The sad fact of the matter is that every RH book that has come out to date has been shite ‚Äì the writing, the info, even the binding ‚Äì 2 of the books I bought came apart.  When is the band going to get proper treatment?  We need a Mark Lewisohn!‚Ä¶ So far, the books are all on a par with the ‚Äúdocumentary‚Äù called ‚ÄúHomework.‚Äù  Shite!  Hopefully this book will be passable.
3 Is the information simply culled from interviews, such as the ones posted from Citizen insane, and that we have all read.
4 did the author do his share of the proverbial ‚Äúhundreds of hours of interviews‚Äù with his subject and the people closest to said subject?
5 Is it written in a prose style that is not your standard rock journalism style, which is terrible.  This is to say, does it presuppose that the fans are illiterate morons who only read rolling stone.
We‚Äôre gonna have to wait for Radiohead‚Äôs career to be over, for a few years to go by for the true impact of their work to sink in, before we get a decent, full-length, full-band bio.
I think I will read it. But what is also cantradictory is that in the Radiohead biography ‚Äúhysterical and useless ‚Äù theres a quote of thom saying he has never been an outcast ‚Äúsorry to disappoint‚Äù but the description of this book says he had been and thus wrote such songs‚Ä¶. Well, let‚Äôs see, what it will be like.
These comments confirm that Radiohead fans are the greatest fans on the planet.  We all share one common interest: we love Radiohead. ‚ÄúThis is one for the good days‚Äù eh? I agree with Justin Shanes and I is Another.    Piss off Bono!
Music, and I thought it was very good. I‚Äôm not sure what this book will say that I don‚Äôt already know, but I‚Äôll most likely read this book.
Nope. If someone were to write a ‚Äúbiography‚Äù full of slanderous untruths, Thom could certainly sue for libel, but in order for something to be libelous, it must also be demonstrably untrue. So if this biography is just a rehashing of info thats already out there, it‚Äôs completely legal. Think of all the George W. Bush biographies out there‚Ä¶ Do you think he authorized all of them? Or the Jerome Corsi book about Obama‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs legal.
Thanks for all the comments. I realise this probably falls into the ‚Äúwell he would say that‚Äù file but I hope most people reading the book will be pleasantly surprised. It‚Äôs not just put together from cuttings. I‚Äôd like to think the interviews I‚Äôve done throw new light on the music and on Thom‚Äôs life without being intrusive. I should also point out that the Pitchfork quote isn‚Äôt a review ‚Äì it was written before the book even went to press‚Ä¶
If the Dave Grohl and Matt Bellamy biographies published by Independent Music Press are anything to go by, I would steer well clear.
Both of the afore mentioned biographies felt hurried and with content seemingly just a few clicks away from Google. They give the impression that Independent Music Press does not believe in spending money on proofreading and editing.
