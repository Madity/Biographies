=======================================================
John Clayton Mayer (/ˈmeɪ.ər/)[1] (born October 16, 1977) is an American recording artist and producer.[2] Born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and raised in Fairfield, he attended Berklee College of Music in Boston. He moved to Atlanta in 1997, where he refined his skills and gained a following, and he now lives in Montana.[3] His first two studio albums, Room for Squares (2001) and Heavier Things (2003), did well commercially, achieving multi-platinum status.[4] In 2003, he won a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for "Your Body Is a Wonderland."[5]
Mayer began his career performing mainly acoustic rock, but gradually began a transition towards the blues genre in 2005 by collaborating with renowned blues artists such as B. B. King, Buddy Guy, and Eric Clapton, and by forming the John Mayer Trio. The blues influence can be heard throughout his 2005 live album Try! with the John Mayer Trio and his third studio album Continuum, released in September 2006. At the 49th Annual Grammy Awards in 2007, Mayer won Best Pop Vocal Album for Continuum and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for "Waiting on the World to Change". He released his fourth studio album, Battle Studies, in November 2009. His fifth album, Born and Raised, which saw another musical style shift, was released in May 2012, followed by his sixth album Paradise Valley in August 2013. He has sold over ten million albums in the U.S. and over 20 million albums worldwide.
Mayer's career pursuits have extended to comedy, graphic design, television hosting, and writing; he has written pieces for magazines, most notably for Esquire. He has performed at charity organizations and participates in various environmental causes.
John Clayton Mayer was born on October 16, 1977 in Bridgeport, Connecticut to high school principal Richard Mayer and English teacher Margaret Hoffman. He grew up in Fairfield, Connecticut. He has a younger brother named Ben and an older brother named Carl.[6] He attended the Center for Global Studies at Brien McMahon High School in Norwalk for his junior year (then known as the Center for Japanese Studies Abroad; it is a magnet program for students wanting to learn Japanese).[7]
After watching Michael J. Fox's guitar performance as Marty McFly in Back to the Future, Mayer became fascinated with the instrument, and when he turned 13, his father rented one for him.[8][9] A neighbor gave Mayer a Stevie Ray Vaughan cassette, which cultivated Mayer's love of blues music.[10]a[›] Mayer started taking lessons from a local guitar-shop owner, Al Ferrante, and soon became consumed with playing the instrument.[11][12] His singular focus concerned his parents, and they took him twice to see a psychiatrist—but Mayer was determined to be fine.[11][12] Mayer says that the contentious nature of his parents' marriage led him to "disappear and create my own world I could believe in".[11] After two years of practice, he started playing at blues bars and other venues in the area, while he was still in high school.[7][9] In addition to performing solo, he was a member of a band called Villanova Junction (named for a Jimi Hendrix song) with Tim Procaccini, Joe Beleznay, and Rich Wolf.[11][13] Mayer considered skipping college to pursue his music, but the disapproval of his parents dissuaded him from doing so.[11]
When Mayer was seventeen, he was stricken with cardiac dysrhythmia and was hospitalized for a weekend. Reflecting on the incident, Mayer said, "That was the moment the songwriter in me was born," and he penned his first lyrics the night he got home from the hospital.[14] Shortly thereafter, he began suffering from panic attacks, and lived with the fear of having to enter a mental institution.[11] He continues to manage such episodes with Xanax, an anti-anxiety drug.[14][15]
Mayer enrolled in the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, aged 19.[16] However, at the urging of his college friend an Atlanta, Georgia native, Clay Cook, he left school after two semesters and moved with Cook to Atlanta.[17] In Atlanta they formed a two-man band called LoFi Masters and began performing in local coffee houses and club venues such as Eddie's Attic.[9] According to Cook, they began to experience musical differences due to Mayer's desire to move more towards pop music.[18] As a result, the two parted ways, and Mayer embarked on a solo career.[17]
With the help of local producer and engineer Glenn Matullo, Mayer recorded the independent EP Inside Wants Out. Cook co-wrote many of the songs from the EP including Mayer's first commercial single release, "No Such Thing".[18] The EP includes eight songs with Mayer on lead vocals and guitars. However, Cook's only contribution was backing vocals on the song "Comfortable". For the opening track, "Back To You", a full band was enlisted, including the EP's co-producer David "DeLa" LaBruyere on bass guitars.[19] Mayer and LaBruyere then began to perform throughout Georgia and nearby states.
Mayer's reputation began to build, and a March 2000 appearance at South by Southwest brought him to the attention of "launch" label, Aware Records.[12][20][21] After including him in the Aware Festival concerts and having his songs included on Aware compilations, in early 2001, Aware released Mayer's internet-only album titled, Room for Squares. During this time, Aware inked a deal with Columbia Records that gave Columbia first pick in signing Aware artists, and so in September of the same year, Columbia remixed and re-released Room for Squares.[22] As part of the major label "debut", the album's artwork was updated, and the track "3x5" was added. The re-release also included reworked studio versions of the first four songs from his indie album, Inside Wants Out.[23]
By the end of 2002, Room for Squares had spawned several radio hits, including "No Such Thing," "Your Body Is a Wonderland", and ultimately, "Why Georgia". In 2003, Mayer won a Grammy for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for "Your Body Is a Wonderland." In his acceptance speech he remarked, "This is very, very fast, and I promise to catch up."[24] He also figuratively referred to himself as being sixteen, a remark that many mistook to mean that he was only sixteen years old at the time.[25]
In 2003, Mayer released a live CD and DVD of a concert in Birmingham, Alabama titled Any Given Thursday. The concert featured songs previously not recorded, such as "Man on the Side" (co-written with Cook) and "Something's Missing", which later appeared on Heavier Things. The concert also included "Covered in Rain". According to the accompanying DVD documentary, this song is "part two" of the song "City Love", which features the line "covered in rain". Commercially, the album quickly peaked at number seventeen on the Billboard 200 chart. The CD/DVD received conservative, although consistent, praise, with critics torn between his pop-idol image, and (at the time) emerging guitar prowess. Erik Crawford (of Allmusic) asked "Is he the consummate guitar hero exemplified when he plays a cover of Stevie Ray Vaughan's 'Lenny', or is he the teen idol that the pubescent girls shriek for after he plays 'Your Body Is a Wonderland?'"[26][27]
Heavier Things, Mayer's second album, was released in 2003 to generally favorable reviews. Rolling Stone, Allmusic and Blender all gave positive, although reserved, feedback.[28] The album was commercially successful, and while it did not sell as well as Room for Squares, it peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart. Mayer earned his first number one single with the song "Daughters" as well as a 2005 Grammy for Song of the Year, beating out fellow contenders Alicia Keys and Kanye West. He dedicated the award to his grandmother, Annie Hoffman, who died in May 2004. He also won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, beating Elvis Costello, Prince, and Seal for the award. In a February 9, 2009 interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Mayer said that he thought he should not have won the Grammy for Song of the year because he thought that Alicia Keys' "If I Ain't Got You" was the better song. Because of this, he removed the top half of the Grammy and gave it to Keys, and kept the bottom part for himself. At the 37th Annual Songwriters Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony in 2006, Mayer was honored with the Hal David Starlight Award.[29]
Mayer again recorded live concerts across seven nights of his U.S. tour in 2004. These recordings were released to the iTunes Store under the title As/Is, indicating that the errors were included along with the good moments. A few months later, a "best of" CD was compiled from the As/Is nights. The album included a previously unreleased cover of Marvin Gaye's song "Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)", featuring a solo from Mayer's support act, jazz and blues turntablist DJ Logic. All the album covers of the As/Is releases feature drawings of anthropomorphic bunnies.[30]
January 2005, left to right: David Ryan Harris, John Mayer and Steve Jobs at Macworld 11, SF Moscone Center.
With increased exposure, Mayer's talent came into demand in other areas. Steve Jobs invited Mayer to perform during Apple's annual keynote address at the Macworld Conference & Expo in January 2004 as Jobs introduced the music production software GarageBand.[31] The gig led to Mayer becoming a fixture of the event. He rejoined Jobs on stage for a solo performance at Macworld 2007, following the announcement of the iPhone.[32] Mayer has also done endorsements, such as a Volkswagen commercial for the Beetle's guitar outlet and for the BlackBerry Curve.[33]
Mayer began to collaborate extensively, often working with artists outside of his own genre. He appeared on Common's song "Go!" and on Kanye West's "Bittersweet Poetry".b[›] Following these collaborations, Mayer received praise from rap heavyweights Jay-Z and Nelly.[34] When asked about his presence in the hip hop community, Mayer said, "It's not music out there right now. That's why, to me, hip-hop is where rock used to be."[35]
From the album Be. In 2004, after the three saw the movie Ray together, Kanye West and Mayer joined Common back in the studio. Mayer came up with the song's concept—fantasies—and his vocals were sampled for the track.[36]
It was around this time that Mayer began hinting a change in his musical interests, announcing that he was "closing up shop on acoustic sensitivity."[35] In 2005, he began a string of collaborations with various blues artists, including Buddy Guy, B.B. King, Eric Clapton, as well as jazz artist John Scofield. He also went on tour with legendary jazz pianist Herbie Hancock, which included a show at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee. These collaborations led to recordings with several of these artists, namely, Clapton (Back Home, Crossroads Guitar Festival), Guy (Bring 'Em In), Scofield (That's What I Say), and King (80). Although Mayer has maintained a reputation for being a sensitive singer-songwriter, he has also gained distinction as an accomplished guitarist, influenced by the likes of the above artists, as well as Eric Johnson, Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Robert Cray, and Freddie King.[37]
From the album Try! The first single, "Who Did You Think I Was?," lyrically underscores Mayer's decision to move away from acoustic pop music and towards blues, with lines such as, "Got a brand new blues that I can't explain."[38] This sample features an extended electric guitar solo.
In the spring of 2005, Mayer formed the John Mayer Trio with bassist Pino Palladino and drummer Steve Jordan, both of whom he had met through previous studio sessions. The trio played a combination of blues and rock music. In October 2005, the Trio opened for The Rolling Stones during a sold-out club tour of their own,[39] and that November, released a live album called Try! The band took a break in mid-2006.
Mayer's third studio album, titled Continuum, was released on September 12, 2006, and was produced by Mayer and Steve Jordan. Mayer suggested the album was intended to combine his signature pop music with the feel, sound, groove, and sensibilities of the blues. In that vein, two of the tracks from his Trio release Try!—"Vultures" and "Gravity"—also were included on Continuum.[16]
The first single from Continuum was "Waiting on the World to Change", which debuted on The Ron and Fez Show. The song was the third most downloaded song of the week on the iTunes Store following its release on July 11, 2006, and debuted at No. 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart.
On August 23, 2006, Mayer debuted the entire album on the Los Angeles radio station Star 98.7, giving commentary on each track.[40] A subsequent version was released the next day on the Clear Channel Music website as a streaming sneak preview. On September 21, 2006, Mayer appeared on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, playing "Waiting on the World to Change" and "Slow Dancing in a Burning Room." The song "Gravity" was featured on the television series House, in the episode "Cane & Able", and Numb3rs. He recorded a session for the British program Live from Abbey Road at Abbey Road Studios on October 22, 2006.
On December 7, 2006, Mayer was nominated for five 2007 Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. The John Mayer Trio also received a nomination for their album, Try!. He won two: Best Pop Song with Vocal for "Waiting on the World to Change" and Best Pop Album for Continuum. Mayer remixed an acoustic version of his single "Waiting on the World to Change" with vocal additions from fellow musician Ben Harper. In preparation for recording Continuum, Mayer had booked the Village Recorder in Los Angeles to record five demo acoustic versions of his songs with veteran musician Robbie McIntosh. These recordings became The Village Sessions, an EP released on December 12, 2006. As usual, Mayer oversaw the artwork of the release.[41]
Mayer was featured on the cover of Rolling Stone (#1020) in February 2007, along with John Frusciante and Derek Trucks. He was named as one of the "New Guitar Gods," and the cover nicknamed him "Slowhand, Jr.," a reference to Eric Clapton.[37] Additionally, he was selected by the editors of Time magazine as one of the 100 Most Influential People of 2007 and was listed among artists and entertainers.[42]
On November 20, 2007, the re-issue of Continuum became available online and in stores. The release contains a bonus disc of six live songs from his 2007 tour: five from Continuum and a cover of the Ray Charles song "I Don't Need No Doctor".[43] His new single, "Say", also became available through iTunes. On December 6, 2007, "Belief" was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal for the 50th Annual Grammy Awards. He accompanied Alicia Keys on guitar on her song "No One" at the ceremony.
In February 2008, Mayer hosted a three-day Caribbean cruise event that included performances with various musicians including David Ryan Harris, Brett Dennen, Colbie Caillat, and Dave Barnes, among others. The event was called "The Mayercraft Carrier" and was held aboard the cruise ship known as the Carnival Victory.[44] A follow up cruise titled "Mayercraft Carrier 2" set sail from Los Angeles from March 27–31, 2009 on the Carnival Splendor.
On July 1, 2008, Mayer released Where the Light Is, a live concert film of Mayer's performance at the Nokia Theatre L.A. Live on December 8, 2007.[45] The film was directed by Danny Clinch.[46] It features an acoustic set and a set with the John Mayer Trio, followed by a set with John's band from the Continuum album.[47]
Australian artist Guy Sebastian invited Mayer to collaborate on three songs from his 2009 album Like It Like That.[48] Mayer also played guitar on the title track of Crosby Loggins' debut LP, Time to Move, released on July 10, 2009.[49]
On July 7, 2009, Mayer performed an instrumental guitar version of Michael Jackson's "Human Nature" at Jackson's televised memorial service.[50]
On November 17, 2009, Mayer's fourth studio album, Battle Studies, was released and debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart.[51] The album consists of 11 tracks with a total time of 45 minutes. The first single from the album, "Who Says", was released on September 24, 2009 in advance of album, and was followed on October 19 by the single "Heartbreak Warfare" and the single "Half of My Heart" released on June 21, 2010. Despite the album's commercial success, critics were mixed with their praise; while some reviews were glowing, calling it his "most adventurous",[52][53] others called the album "safe" and noted that "Mayer the singer-songwriter and Mayer the man about town sometimes seem disconnected, like they don't even belong in the same body."[11][54][55][56] Mayer admitted to Rolling Stone that he thought Battle Studies was not his best album.[57][58]
Following his controversial interviews to Playboy and Rolling Stone about Jessica Simpson and Jennifer Aniston, Mayer withdrew from public life. He later explained on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, "I lost my head for a little while and I did a couple of dumb interviews and it kind of woke me up. It was a very strange time and it sort of rocketed me into adulthood. It was a violent crash into being an adult. For a couple of years, it was just figuring it all out, and I'm glad I actually stayed out of the spotlight."[59][60][61]
Early reports indicated that the follow-up to Battle Studies would be called Born and Raised, and would be released in October 2011.[62]
On September 16, 2011, Mayer posted on his blog that his new record, Born and Raised, was being delayed due to granulomas discovered in his throat. The granulomas were found next to the vocal cords and were said to be treatable.[63] Mayer described this as a "temporary setback" and added that recording and mixing of Born and Raised was entirely finished except for a few remaining vocal tracks.[64] He told, "I did a lot of therapy, like anti-acid reflux, and it didn’t work, then I went on vocal rest. No alcohol. No spicy food. No talking. Most of September I wasn’t talking at all. I’d have a Bluetooth keyboard, and someone would have an iPad to read what I type. I had to point to menus at restaurants. People look at me like I’m crazy."[65] On October 20, 2011, Mayer updated his fans about the treatment of his throat granuloma, announcing that he "had surgery this afternoon to remove it and am now on complete vocal rest for a month or more", during which he plans to "travel the country, look, and listen."[64]
The first single from Born and Raised, called "Shadow Days" was released on February 27, 2012. On February 28, 2012, John Mayer released the track listing for the album and announced that Born and Raised would be released on May 22, 2012.[66] He described it as his "most honest" album.[59]
On March 9, 2012, Mayer announced on his blog that due to the return of a serious throat condition, he had been forced to cancel his tour and refrain from all singing indefinitely.[67] Because the surgery he had in October 2011 did not work as expected, Mayer said he would have to undergo the surgery again.[65] He had the surgery in late August 2012 and later posted a message on his Tumblr account explaining that he would not sing for several months.[68] Despite not being able to sing, Mayer played the guitar with other artists. He appeared in September 2012 on Saturday Night Live where he played the guitar while Frank Ocean was singing.[69] He also played with the Rolling Stones during the band's gig in New Jersey in December 2012.[70] In January 2013, Mayer recovered sufficiently and returned to the stage during a benefit concert in Bozeman, Montana after almost two years of absence.[71] In April 2013, he performed at the Crossroads Guitar Festival[72] and at the 28th Annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, where he inducted Albert King.[73] He was also among the lineup of the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, which took place later that month.[74]
Following his recovery from vocal surgery, Mayer returned to the studio. On June 18, 2013, Mayer announced from his Facebook page that his sixth album, Paradise Valley, would be released on August 13, 2013.[75] On the same day, he released a lyric video for the new album's first single, "Paper Doll", on his YouTube page.[76] The release date was later changed to August 20, 2013. "Who You Love" featuring Katy Perry followed as the album's third single and a music video was released on December 17, 2013 for the song.[77] The album, which also includes a collaboration with Frank Ocean,[78] was met with positive reviews from music critics.[79] Mayer embarked on a tour, his first in three years, in support of Born and Raised and Paradise Valley. The American leg of the tour ran from July to December 2013 with Interscope recording artist Phillip Phillips serving as support act.[80][81] The tour will visit Australia in April 2014.[82]
In 2002, Mayer began the "Back to You" Fund, a nonprofit organization that focuses on fundraising in the areas of health care, education, the arts, and talent development. The foundation raises funds through the auction of exclusive John Mayer items, such as guitar picks, T-shirts, and signed CDs, made available on Mayer's auction site. The auctions have been successful, with some tickets selling for more than seventeen times their face value.[83][84]
Mayer participated at the East Rutherford, New Jersey location of the Live Earth project, a musical rally to support awareness for global warming held July 7, 2007.[85]
Mayer has performed at a number of benefits and telethons for charity throughout his career. In response to the Virginia Tech massacre, Mayer (along with Dave Matthews Band, Phil Vassar, and Nas) performed a free concert at Virginia Tech's Lane Stadium on September 6, 2007.[86] On December 8, 2007, Mayer hosted the first annual Charity Revue, a tradition he has continued each year. Charities who have benefited from the concerts include Toys for Tots, Inner City Arts, and the Los Angeles Mission.[87] CDs and DVDs of the first concert were released under the title Where the Light Is in July 2008.[45][47] Mayer appeared on Songs for Tibet: The Art of Peace, a celebrity initiative to support Tibet and the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso.[88] In January 2013, Mayer participated with Zac Brown in a benefit concert in Bozeman, Montana where they raised more than $100,000 for firefighters who battled a wildfire in the summer of 2012 in Paradise Valley that destroyed 12,000 acres.[71][89]
"I'm actually into sneakers on a design level. I've got a big design thing going on in my life right now ... I love designing stuff. I mean, my biggest dream, forget Grammys, I want to be able to design an Air Max."
In a Rolling Stone interview, Mayer recalled that after former Columbia Records head, Don Ienner, panned Continuum, he briefly considered quitting music and studying design full-time.[14] In 2003, Martin Guitars gave Mayer his own signature model acoustic guitar called the OM-28 John Mayer.[91] The guitar was limited to a run of only 404, an Atlanta area code.[92] This model was followed by the release of two Fender signature Stratocaster electric guitars, beginning in 2005. A third Stratocaster, finished in charcoal frost metallic paint with a racing stripe, was also a limited-release, with only 100 guitars made. In January 2006, Martin Guitars released the Martin OMJM John Mayer acoustic guitar. The guitar was intended to have many of the attributes of the Martin OM-28 John Mayer but with a more affordable price tag.[93] In August 2006, Fender started manufacturing SERIES II John Mayer Stratocasters.
In January 2007, Two Rock collaborated with Mayer on custom-designed amps. Only 25 (all signed by Mayer himself) were made available to the public[94] along with a 500-run John Mayer signature Fender Stratocaster in Cypress-Mica, including the limited Cypress-Mica model was the INCSvsJM gig bag on which Mayer collaborated with Incase designs. In 2006, Mayer was estimated to have more than 200 guitars in his personal collection.[14] In 2010, Fender announced a production model of Mayer's "The Black One" guitar.[95]
With the June 1, 2004, issue of Esquire, Mayer began a column called "Music Lessons with John Mayer". Each article featured a lesson and his views on various topics, both of personal and popular interest. In the August 2005 issue, he invited readers to create music for orphaned lyrics he had written.[96] The winner was Tim Fagan of L.A., as announced in the following January's issue.[97]
Mayer has been active online, and has maintained four blogs: a Myspace page, a blog at his official site, another at Honeyee.com, one at Tumblr.com, and a photoblog at StunningNikon.com. He also is one of the most-followed persons on the micro-blogging site Twitter,[98] reaching 3 million followers in January 2010. Although his posts often deal with career-related matters, they also contain jokes, videos, photos, his convictions, and his personal activities; they sometimes overlap in content. He is noted for writing the blogs himself, and not through a publicist.[15][42] On January 23, 2008, he posted a graphic that read, "Done & Dusted & Self Conscious & Back to Work." on his official blog, followed by the quote "There is danger in theoretical speculation of battle, in prejudice, in false reasoning, in pride, in braggadocio. There is one safe resource, the return to nature..";c[›] all the previous blog entries were deleted.[99]
In the mid-2000s he did comedy sporadically[98] making random appearances at the famed Comedy Cellar in New York and at other venues. He stated that it helped him write better but that increased media attention made him too careful in his technique.[14]
In 2004, Mayer hosted a one-shot, half-hour comedy special on VH1 titled John Mayer Has a TV Show, with antics including wearing a bear suit while anonymously teasing concertgoers in the parking lot outside one of his concerts. The American network CBS announced on January 14, 2009 that they were in negotiations with Mayer for a variety show; it may air as a special or as a regular series.[101][102] In an interview with Rolling Stone, posted online on January 22, 2010, Mayer confirmed that the program, also called John Mayer Has a TV Show, was still in development, and that personnel were being hired. He described the concept as "a high quality music performance show, where I could also steer it a little bit. It's about there being a bastion of artists being made to look good and sound good.".[103]
Mayer has made many appearances on talk shows and other television programs, most notably, on a Chappelle's Show comedy skit, the Late Show with David Letterman and on the final episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Mayer made an appearance with Rob Dyrdek in the MTV show Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory. Mayer wrote the theme song to the OWN network show Rollin' with Zach, which features Zach Anner.[104]
Mayer has toured with many musical groups, including Maroon 5,[105] Guster, Howie Day, Mat Kearney, Counting Crows,[106] Ben Folds, The Wallflowers, Teitur,[107] Brett Dennen, Sheryl Crow, Colbie Caillat, Train, Ellie Goulding, OneRepublic, and Paramore. Crow and Mayer, who had just previously appeared on the Cars Soundtrack together, co-headlined a tour that ran from August to October 2006.[108] In 2007, Mayer toured Europe, hoping to reach the popularity abroad that he enjoys in North America.[109] The initial North American Continuum tour ended on February 28, 2007, with a show at Madison Square Garden, a performance which the New York Post described as "career-defining."[110] In 2010, Mayer and Keith Urban performed at a CMT Crossroads concert which saw Mayer and Urban performing a medley of their own songs together and a rendition of George Michael's single, "Faith". This performance was led to Urban and Mayer teaming up again for future performances, including at the 2010 CMT Music Awards.
Mayer allows audio taping at most of his live performances, and he also allows for the non-commercial trading of those recordings. He does this to give fans the opportunity to recreate the live experience, and to encourage fan interaction.[111]
Mayer often shows up at small venues unannounced (or with little advance notice) for surprise concerts—occasionally for free or without accepting the performance fee.[112][113][114][115] He has made appearances throughout the Los Angeles, Atlanta and New York areas, including shows at The Laugh Factory,[116] Eddie's Attic,[117] and the Village Underground.[115] His latest surprise appearance was on January 8, 2011 at Hotel Cafe where he played seven new unreleased songs. In 2004, after being asked for numerous past years, he performed for over 1000 students at the Pennsbury High School Senior Prom. Wonderland: A Year in the Life of an American High School (Grove Press, ISBN 978-0802141972), a book written by Michael Bamberger, describes the world- famous prom and John Mayer's performance.
Mayer's parents concluded an uncontested divorce on May 27, 2009.[118] After the divorce, Mayer moved his (82-year-old) father to an assisted-living facility in Los Angeles.[11]
Mayer has dated Jennifer Love Hewitt,[116] Jessica Simpson, Minka Kelly,[119] Jennifer Aniston, Taylor Swift, and Katy Perry.
Mayer's relationship with Jessica Simpson coincided with some personal behaviour changes that served to significantly increase his tabloid exposure.[12][120][121] Previously, Mayer had expressed his resolve to completely avoid drugs, alcohol, clubbing, "red-carpet" events, dating celebrities and anything else that he felt would detract from his focus on his music.[122] In interviews, however, Mayer has alluded to experiencing an extreme "anxiety bender" episode in his twenties that motivated him to be less reclusive.[11][12] He later said he realized that, "If I wanted to see Jessica more, I had to grow up," and not be afraid to be without his guitar.[12] He called his relationship with her "sexual napalm" and said she had the power to "change [his] values."[120] He began making appearances at clubs in Los Angeles and New York City (where he would stage pranks for the paparazzi), and in a Rolling Stone interview from 2006, he first mentioned that he had begun using marijuana.[14]
With Taylor Swift, he recorded "Half of My Heart" for his November 2009 album Battle Studies.[123] She reportedly wrote a song about her relationship with him, "Dear John", which appears on her October 2010 Speak Now album. In June 2012, Mayer criticized the song, saying, "I will say as a songwriter that I think it's kind of cheap songwriting."[124] The first single from Mayer's August 2013 album Paradise Valley, "Paper Doll" is thought to be a response to Swift's "Dear John",[125] a claim which Mayer has neither confirmed nor denied.[126]
In early 2010, Mayer gave a controversial interview to Playboy magazine,[128][129] in which he revealed sexually explicit details about his former girlfriends Jessica Simpson and Jennifer Aniston, and responded to questions about his interest in dating black women by saying, "My dick is sort of like a white supremacist. I've got a Benetton heart and a fuckin' David Duke cock. I'm going to start dating separately from my dick."[120] He also used the word "nigger" in the interview. This set off accusations in the media of him being a misogynist, kiss-and-tell ex-boyfriend, and racist.[130] He apologized via Twitter for his use of the word "nigger", saying, "It was arrogant of me to think I could intellectualize..... a word that is so emotionally charged."[131] He also tearfully apologized to his band and fans at his concert in Nashville later that night.[132] Mayer was dubbed an "accidental racist" by comedian Kumail Nanjiani.[133]

In the 2000s, when he wasn't shagging starlets or performing stand-up comedy, John Mayer was leveraging his two distinct gifts: His virtuosic guitar skills and his aptitude for classy pop-rock songs. Putting those abilities to use both on his solo albums and with the John Mayer Trio, his blues-rock group, Mayer earned big chart success, becoming the sensitive singer-songwriter of choice for hordes of Americans. 
The middle son of two teachers who grew up in Fairfield, CT, Mayer picked up guitar at age 13 and was soon playing local blues clubs both solo and with the band Villanova Junction. At 17, he suffered a cardiac arrhythmia that kept him hospitalized for a week. It was then that his songwriting career began in earnest. A year after finishing high school, Mayer enrolled at Boston's Berklee College of Music on a partial scholarship. He dropped out after his first year to move to Atlanta and play live with his friend Clay Cook under the name LoFi Masters. Mayer left the duo to record his first EP, 1999's Inside Wants Out, which he distributed himself while playing gigs across the South.
Mayer's big break came after he appeared at 2000's South by Southwest Music Festival in Austin, TX, when he signed with Aware Records, a Columbia subsidiary. His first full-length album, Room for Squares (Number 8, 2001) was picked up by Columbia for wide release. Room for Squares went multi-platinum on the back of singles "No Such Thing" (Number 13, 2002) and "Your Body Is a Wonderland" (Number 18, 2002). Columbia followed that success by reissuing Inside Wants Out in late 2002.
After the stopgap live album Any Given Thursday (Number 17, 2003), Mayer's studio follow-up, 2003's Heavier Things, debuted at Number One and yielded singles "Bigger Than My Body" (Number 33, 2003) and "Daughters" (Number 19, 2004). Another live record, As/Is, followed in 2004. That year, Mayer began to abandon his sensitive balladeer image in favor of a smart-ass Renaissance man persona, complete with sardonic blog posts, a column in Esquire magazine, a one-off TV show on VH1, and a memorable guest spot on The Chappelle Show, jamming in a Harlem barbershop with members of the Roots.
Around the same time, Mayer began to branch our musically as well. He provided backing vocals on rapper Common's single "Go!" and shared the songwriting credit with Common and Kanye West. In his own music, Mayer began to focus on meatier stuff, particularly the blues. He played shows with Buddy Guy and Herbie Hancock, and in November 2005 released another live album, Try!   (Number 34), credited to the John Mayer Trio, which included veteran session musicians Steve Jordan on drums and Pino Palladino on bass. The trio opened for the Rolling Stones on their A Bigger Bang tour that October. Mayer's next solo album, the blues-heavy Continuum (Number 2, 2006) followed a year later, and its quasi-political protest song, "Waiting on the World to Change" (Number 14, 2006), explored lyrical territory untouched on his previous releases.
In 2007, Time magazine featured Mayer as part of its Time 100 series, lauding his "emphatic voice and emotional fearlessness." Mayer's third live album, Where the Light Is (Number 5, 2008), a three-disc release, featured a solo acoustic set, an electric set with Jordan and Palladino and an eight-man ensemble performance. Where the Light Is combined Mayer's recent solo work with covers of Tom Petty, Jimi Hendrix and Elmore James.
Over the years Mayer has been the subject of much tabloid fodder, having been linked to Jessica Simpson and actresses Jennifer Love Hewitt and Minka Kelly. His tumultuous relationship with Jennifer Aniston kept Mayer in the tabloids for months on end. He has also dabbled in stand-up comedy, and CBS announced in January 2009 that it was developing a variety show pilot starring Mayer.
In 2009, Mayer performed an instrumental version of Michael Jackson's "Human Nature" at Jackson's memorial service, and in November, Mayer released his fourth studio album, Battle Studies, which debuted at Number One.

1990sVarsity Blues"I went to school to get it over with," John Mayer, the middle son of Richard (a high school principal) and Margaret (a teacher), tells ABC News in 2003. "I remember asking my mom, 'Mom, will you please let me drop out?'" (He'll later capture that angst in his breakthrough hit, "No Such Thing"). After graduation, Mayer spends 15 months working as a full-service gas station attendant for $7 an hour, and uses the cash to buy a guitar. 1998Southern SojournAfter two semesters at Boston's Berklee College of Music, Mayer drops out to pursue music and relocates to Atlanta, Georgia. "Atlanta's my musical home," he says in 2003. "It really was the place where I really came alive." He becomes a frequent performer at local blues clubs, self-releases his first album, Inside Wants Out, and performs at the prestigious South by Southwest Music Festival in 2000, where he lands a contract with Columbia Records' Aware Records.2001Big Break!Mayer releases his major-label debut, Room for Squares, prominently featuring Mayer's fetching face on the cover. It climbs to No. 8 on the Billboard 200 and sells more than 4 million copies on the strength of such singles as "No Such Thing" and "Your Body is a Wonderland."2002Enter Jennifer LoveMayer gets his muse when he meets actress Jennifer Love Hewitt. The two begin an intense – but brief – relationship. "It was a strange little detour that I took for a minute," he tells EW, admitting he had been "madly in love." "It sucks. Because the idea of it was fantastic. It just didn't work." As for the rumor that "Your Body is a Wonderland" is an ode to Hewitt? Not so, she insists to PEOPLE. "John would have written, 'Your body is a disaster.'"
2003February 23Grammy GoldMayer accepts the Grammy for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for "Your Body is a Wonderland," saying, "This is very, very fast and I promise to catch up." Though endearingly self-deprecating, it's a comment Mayer regrets. "I should have said something different," he tells ABC News days later. September 09No Sophomore SlumpMayer's latest album, Heavier Things, hits No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Though his sentimental ballad, "Daughters," earns him two Grammys (Best Male Pop Vocal Performance and Song of the Year), Mayer tells Rolling Stone that he thought the song was so sappy: "I saw it as career death." 2005Change of DirectionMayer says "Daughters" "pigeonholed" him, so he makes an unexpected move when he forms a bluesy, guitar-driven jam band, The John Mayer Trio (right), with bassist Pino Palladino (who'd toured with The Who) and drummer Steve Jordan (who'd recorded with Mayer's hero Eric Clapton and Bob Dylan). After releasing Try! with the trio, he begins a series of collaborations with everyone from B.B. King to Alicia Keys. 2006John Mayer the ComedianThe singer – who has appeared on Comedy Central's Chappelle's Show and filmed his own VH-1 comedy special – begins performing little-announced gigs at stand-up comedy venues in L.A. and New York. "Everyone connected to my well-being and on my payroll says stand-up is terrible," he tells Rolling Stone (which puts him on the cover as one of the generation's "New Guitar Gods"). "When I say, 'I'm doing stand-up tonight,' they hear, 'I'm going to start heroin.'" His frequently risqué routines get Mayer in trouble, most notably when reports surfaced that he'd used the n-word on stage.September 12Lighting Strikes ThriceMayer releases Continuum, which includes the protest anthem "Waiting on the World to Change." The CD becomes Mayer's third studio album to go platinum, and Rolling Stone says it "deftly fuses his love for old-school blues and R&B with his natural gift for sharp melodies and well-constructed songs." He wins two Grammys for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance and Best Pop Vocal Album.October 11Grin and 'Bear' ItMayer, a notorious jokester, takes aim at Sheryl Crow (right) during their joint tour. For their second-to-last show, he comes onstage during her performance wearing a bear costume. Afterward, he writes on his blog, "This incredible six-week experience will be summed up with just a photograph: Sheryl Crow leaning against a [schmuck] in a bear suit." Crow gets her revenge at the next show, popping up in a bikini.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          John Mayer was born on October 16, 1977 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, USA as John Clayton Mayer.
      He decided to call the album, "Room for Squares", a characteristically wry take on jazz sax player Hank Mobley's 1963 LP, "No Room for Squares".
      Has an older brother named Carl and a younger brother named Ben. Ben is 18 months younger than John.
      His first job was in a supermarket in Fairfield, Connecticut. Later he worked in a gas station.
      John's parents are Margaret (Hoffman) and Richard Mayer. John's father's family is Ashkenazi Jewish. John's maternal grandfather was of German, Luxembourgian, and Swedish descent, and John's maternal grandmother was English, born in Lancashire.
      Is a big fan of Opie & Anthony and also Ron & Fez on XM Satellite Radio. He debuted the single "Waiting On the World to Change" when he dropped by unannounced at their New York studio on June 14, 2006. Since then, he has regularly checked in with both shows, either calling in to contribute to the topic or just stopping by to hang out.
      When he was seventeen, he was suddenly stricken with a cardiac arrhythmia that sent him to the hospital for a weekend. The trauma of the incident sparked his songwriting, and he penned his first lyrics the night he got home. Shortly thereafter, he began suffering from crippling panic attacks that only subsided when he was twenty-six, and even now, he keeps a Xanax (an anti-anxiety drug) with him, just in case.
      Frequents Los Angeles bar The Roger Room along with Jason Sarayba, Chris Pine, and Samantha Ronson.
      In a relationship with singer Katy Perry since mid 2012. The two released a duet together called "Who You Love" in 2013.
      Connecticut's where I built the parts, Boston's where I assembled them, and Atlanta is where I sold them to people.
      I love coconut, because when you think you're done eating coconut, 25 minutes later, a little piece of coconut comes out of the back of your mouth, and then you say, "Hey! It's more coconut!" I think any food with that kind of determination needs a little respect.
      I am beginning to know what it feels like to be a woman. To have people looking at you all the time. And I'm sorry ladies, I had no idea! But people are looking at me all the time. It's like I have musical boobies!
      [crowd cheers] "That was a good response and I'm not going to ask you to do it again. There's nothing I hate more than going to a concert and the guy says 'You having a good time?' and you scream your head off and then the guy says 'I can't hear you!' and I'm like 'The fuck you can't!' I absolutely hate it when guys do that. So I promise you I'll never make you do that. If you scream respectably the first time anyway."
      So we've got one more song to play for you tonight...[crowd grumbles]...what, you know there's an encore too. The encore is sort of like the condom in the pocket: everybody knows it's there but nobody talks about it.
      I've always said I've got the coolest fans, and I brag about you like grandchildren when I talk to other artists
      Ladies, if you want to know the way to my heart...good spelling and good grammar, good punctuation, capitalize only where you are supposed to capitalize, it's done.
      About the xBox game 'Halo': "I'm good. I'm fierce. And I'm not some gaming overachiever. I just have a skill. I was born to kill bionically augmented men."
      High school is like a spork: its a crappy spoon AND a crappy fork, so in the end, its just plain useless.
      I love you all so much. We really need to come up with a new name for 'fans'. How about really good friends who can't come over my house.
      I'm not really good at keeping my own secrets. I can keep other people's secrets pretty well. Unless they're really good and people deserve to hear them. And I'll disseminate the information accordingly.
      [As he ties his shoe onstage] "It's very difficult to tie one shoe with the same tension as the other one, because if one should be a little tighter than the other, the show's gonna suck. I'm a man of symmetry."
      If I look a little heavier these days it's because I'm bulking up for a role. I'm playing a musician on tour who eats everything in sight while hardly exercising.
      I'm half Jewish. People say, 'Well, which side of your family is Jewish?' I say, 'My dad's.' And they always say it doesn't count. But I will say I keep my pool at 92 degrees, so you do the math. I find myself relating to Judaism. One of my best friends is Jewish beyond all Jews-I went to my first Passover seder at his house- and I train in Krav Maga with a lot of Israelis.
      [observation, 2013] I'd like to get to that point where people go, 'You've got a really good sound'. There are certain songs from the past that don't fit in that sound right now, and I'm working overtime to write more songs that do.
      [on recording the duet 'Who You Love' with Katy Perry] I had this little chorus for years. And it was 'You love who you love' and I thought that was always going to be a great thing someday to have a song that people could hear and feel that sort of permission. And then it came out again and sometimes you just have to play stuff for other people... And I played it for Don Was, the producer of the record, and he went, 'That's something' and I said, 'I don't know' and then he said, 'Why don't you get Katy to do it?' And my first thought was, 'You can't do that' and then the more I thought about just the music part of it, it made perfect sense. Even if I didn't know Katy, it would have made perfect sense... For me it always had to be about the song. It's a pretty big moving target to be a couple and have a song but I think there's an authenticity to it when you hear it.

After making his introduction as a sensitive, acoustic-styled songwriter on 2001's Room for Squares, John Mayer steadily widened his approach over the subsequent years, encompassing everything from blues-rock to adult contemporary in the process. Arriving during the tail end of teen pop's heyday, he crafted pop music for a more discerning audience, spiking his songcraft with jazz chords and literate turns of phrase. The combination proved to be quite popular, as Room for Squares went triple platinum before its follow-up release, Heavier Things, arrived in September 2003. Mayer continued to retool his sound with each album, however, moving beyond the material that had launched his career and adopting elements of rock, blues, and soul. Moreover, he partnered with legends of several genres, making guest appearances on albums by Buddy Guy, Eric Clapton, and B.B. King, while touring alongside jazz icon Herbie Hancock. Mayer also retained enough pop/rock foundation to continue his reign of the charts, making him one of the decade's most popular songwriters.
Born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and raised in the nearby town of Fairfield, Mayer began playing blues as a teenager. By 1997, his skill on the electric guitar was enough to warrant admission into the Berklee College of Music, although Mayer dropped out after two semesters to pursue a songwriting career in Atlanta. Working alongside former classmate Clay Cook, he frequented the local coffeehouse circuit and began co-writing material that melded palatable pop/rock with unexpected flourishes. Cook and Mayer parted ways shortly thereafter, however, with Cook joining the Marshall Tucker Band's touring lineup for several years. Now a solo artist by default, Mayer recorded several of the duo's songs, packaged them alongside a handful of his own compositions, and self-released the EP in 1999 under the title Inside Wants Out.
Mayer secured a deal with Aware Records in early 2000, and recording sessions for his debut album commenced later that year with producer John Alagia, renowned for his work with Dave Matthews and Ben Folds Five. Although Inside Wants Out had been a decidedly acoustic effort, Room for Squares proved to be a more expansive affair, with several of Mayer's old songs receiving new, radio-ready arrangements. Released in 2001 by both Aware and Columbia Records, the album quickly launched Mayer's career, with "No Such Thing" and "Your Body Is a Wonderland" both becoming Top 20 hits. 
As Mayer hit the road in support of the album, his considerable talent as a lead guitarist (a skill that had been downplayed during Room for Squares) flourished, leading him to showcase several blues-influenced solos on his 2003 live album, Any Given Thursday. That same year, Mayer won his first Grammy Award for "Your Body Is a Wonderland." He returned to the Grammy ceremony two years later, this time to accept a pair of awards for "Daughters," a soulful ballad from his lucrative sophomore release, Heavier Things. Commercial and critical success notwithstanding, Mayer's interest in other genres convinced him to take a brief break from pop music, and he tested his instrumental chops by collaborating with blues artists (Buddy Guy, B.B. King, Eric Clapton) and jazz legends (John Scofield, Herbie Hancock). He also assembled the John Mayer Trio, whose bluesy rock & roll was displayed on the band's first and only release, Try! 
Mayer returned to his solo career with 2006's Continuum, a warmly received album that saw him focusing on blues, pop, and contemporary soul. "Gravity" found modest success as a single, but "Waiting on the World to Change" proved to be the album's commercial highlight, cracking the Top 20 in February 2007 and winning a Grammy that same month. Later that year, Mayer achieved his highest-charting single to date with "Say," a song from the Rob Reiner film The Bucket List. After "Say" peaked at number 12, the song was included in a reissued version of Continuum, and it took home yet another Grammy Award (along with "Gravity") in early 2009. 
Mayer returned to the studio in 2009 and emerged with Battle Studies, featuring the single "Heartbreak Warfare." Building upon Continuum's slick, adult contemporary sound, the album sold well. However, its release marked a tough period for Mayer's public image, as he was criticized for comments he made about ex-girlfriends Jessica Simpson and Jennifer Aniston during interviews for Rolling Stone and Playboy. Subsequently, Mayer deleted his Twitter account and took some time off from appearing in public and doing interviews. 
In 2011, while recording his fifth studio album, the Don Was-produced Born and Raised, Mayer revealed that he would be receiving treatment for granulomas found near his vocal cords. Following his surgery, Mayer completed the album and debuted the leadoff single "Shadow Days." A stripped-down affair, Born and Raised showcased a more rootsy, folk and country-tinged sound than his previous efforts. Three months before the album's release, a recurrence of Mayer's granulomas forced him to cancel his subsequent planned tour and abstain from singing indefinitely while he received more treatment. Upon its release, Born and Raised became Mayer's first album to spend more than two weeks at the number one spot on the Billboard 200 chart. In 2013, Mayer returned to the studio with Don Was to record Paradise Valley, his sixth album and one that would continue to explore the rootsy, folk style of Born and Raised. ~ Andrew Leahey, Rovi

John Mayer is a real child.  He had the best and most beautiful individual in Jennifer Aniston and he drops the ball.  You can't get any better.  Oh that's right you like sluts like Jessica Simpson. Simpson is such a wantabe just like her family.  They should go to work like real people and know what it is to work instead of trying to be performers.    Remember John, Jen has introduced you to the Hollywood scene and in a subtle way has helped you gain more fame and recognition.You are nothing without her.  She is everything with or without you.  She has one thing that very few have in the Hollywood scene.  Class!!!   Grow up and learnn to tell the truth instead of coating words with lie after lie.
