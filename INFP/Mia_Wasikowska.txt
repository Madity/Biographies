=======================================================
Mia Wasikowska (/ˌvɑːʃiˈkɒfskə/ VAH-shee-KOF-skə;[1][2] born 14 October 1989)[3] is an Australian actress. After starting her acting career in Australian television and film, she first became known to a wider audience following her critically acclaimed work on the HBO television series In Treatment. She gained worldwide prominence in 2010 after starring as Alice in Tim Burton's $1 billion-grossing Alice in Wonderland and appearing in The Kids Are All Right, a role for which she received the Hollywood Awards' Breakthrough Actress Award.
In 2011, Wasikowska portrayed the title character in Cary Fukunaga's adaptation of Jane Eyre, and starred in Gus Van Sant's Restless and Rodrigo Garcia's Albert Nobbs. She also starred in John Hillcoat's Lawless (2012) and in Park Chan-wook's Stoker (2013).
Wasikowska was born and brought up in Canberra, Australia,[4] and is the middle child of three, with an older sister, Jess and a younger brother, Kai.[5][6] Her mother, Marzena Wasikowska, is a Polish-born photographer, while her father, John Reid, is an Australian photographer and collagist.[7][8][9] In 1998, when she was eight years old, Wasikowska and her family moved to Szczecin, Poland, for a year, after her mother had received a grant to produce a collection of work based on her own experience of having emigrated to Australia in 1974, at the age of eleven.[10][11] Wasikowska and her siblings took part in the production as subjects; she explained to Johanna Schneller of the Toronto Globe and Mail in July 2010, "We never had to smile or perform. We weren't always conscious of being photographed. We'd just do our thing, and she'd take pictures of us."[12]
Wasikowska began training as a ballerina at the age of nine, with hopes of going professional. She began dancing en pointe at thirteen, and was training 35 hours a week in addition to attending school full-time,[1][13] her daily routine consisting of leaving school in the early afternoon and dancing until nine o'clock at night.[14] A spur on her heel hampered her dancing.[15] Her passion for ballet also waned due to the increasing pressure to achieve physical perfection and her growing dissatisfaction with the industry in general, and she quit at fourteen. However, she credits ballet with improving her ability to handle her nerves in auditions.[15]
At the same time, she had been exposed to European and Australian cinema at an early age, particularly Krzysztof Kieślowski's Three Colours trilogy and Gillian Armstrong's My Brilliant Career.[12] Although she was shy and averse to performing during her school years,[12][16] she became inspired to break into acting after watching Holly Hunter in The Piano and Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence,[17] in addition to the opportunity of exploring imperfections in film.[18] Despite having no prior acting experience, Wasikowska looked up twelve Australian talent agencies on the Internet and contacted them all, receiving only one response; she successfully arranged a meeting following persistent callbacks.[17]
Wasikowska landed her first acting role in 2004, with a two-episode stint on the Australian soap All Saints. She had just turned fifteen when she was cast in her Australian film debut, 2006's Suburban Mayhem,[15][19] for which she received a nomination for a Young Actor's AFI Award.[4] That same year, she also appeared in her first short film, Lens Love Story, in which she had no dialogue.
In 2007, Wasikowska appeared in the crocodile horror film Rogue, alongside Radha Mitchell and Sam Worthington. She observed quietly on the set – fellow actor Stephen Curry noted, "We didn't hear a peep out of her for three weeks, which earned her the nickname of 'Rowdy'." [19] She beat out nearly 200 other actresses for a part in the drama September, being cast on the spot by director Peter Carstairs following her audition.[15] She then starred in Spencer Susser's acclaimed short film I Love Sarah Jane, which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.[20][21]
At the age of seventeen, Wasikowska received her first big break role in the United States when she was cast as Sophie, a suicidal gymnast, in HBO's acclaimed weekly drama In Treatment, after she auditioned for the role by videotape.[22][23] The part required her to leave school in Canberra and move to Los Angeles for three months, while enrolling in correspondence courses.[23] She earned critical acclaim for her performance as the troubled teenager treated by psychotherapist Paul Weston (Gabriel Byrne),[24][25][26] which included praise for her excellent American accent.[27] Wasikowska revealed in an October 2008 interview with Variety that she was something of a mimic as a child and that the large influx of American films and TV shows made it easier for Australians to pick up the accent.[28]
The exposure from the show led to Wasikowska picking up her first American film appearances. She played the role of Chaya, the young wife of Asael Bielski (Jamie Bell), in Defiance.[29] Director Edward Zwick cast her without having seen her in In Treatment, explaining to the Australian edition of Vogue, "Her inner life is so vivid that it comes across even when she's being still."[30] Her next role was that of aviation pioneer Elinor Smith in Mira Nair's 2009 biopic Amelia.[31] In June 2008, due to her work on In Treatment, she was a recipient of an Australians in Film Breakthrough Award.[32]
Wasikowska played the supporting role of Pamela Choat in the 2009 Southern Gothic independent film That Evening Sun, opposite Hal Holbrook. Director Scott Teems, seeking a young actress who bore a resemblance to Sissy Spacek, initially balked at the casting director's first suggestion of Wasikowska for the role, as he was adamant at casting all native Southerners for the sake of authenticity.[33][34] However, after auditions with other actresses were unsuccessful, Teems relented and summoned Wasikowska for auditioning. She had only two hours to prepare, which she spent watching clips of Coal Miner's Daughter online in order to quickly learn a Southern accent, and impressed Teems enough that she gained the distinction of being the only non-American actor cast in the film.[34] She was nominated for a 2009 Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female,[35] which she lost to Mo'Nique (Precious), though the film received a South by Southwest award for Best Ensemble Cast.
In July 2008, after a lengthy search, Wasikowska was cast as the eponymous heroine in Tim Burton's retelling of Alice in Wonderland, alongside Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway.[36] She sent a videotaped audition to casting directors in London, and her first live reading in Los Angeles occurred on the same day as her Evening Sun audition.[33] After three more auditions in London – which saw her flying back and forth from Australia to England in just as many weeks – she was awarded the role.[37] Burton cited Wasikowska's "old-soul quality" as a catalyst in casting her: "Because you’re witnessing this whole thing through her eyes, it needed somebody who can subtly portray that."[23] Wasikowska portrayed a nineteen-year-old Alice visiting Wonderland for the first time after fleeing from an unwanted marriage proposal. Her affinity for the character played a part in her desire for the role, as she had read the Lewis Carroll books as a child and was a fan of Jan Švankmajer's 1988 stop-motion film Alice.[38] She also saw Burton's version of the classic story as a chance to explore a deeper characterization of Alice, to whom she felt young women her age could relate, for which she drew on personal experiences. "Alice has a certain discomfort within herself, within society and among her peers; I [...] have definitely felt similarly about all of those things, so I could really understand her not fitting in. Alice also [is] an observer who is thinking a lot, and that's similar to how I am."[37]
For Lisa Cholodenko's indie comedy The Kids Are All Right, Wasikowska was cast as Joni, the bookish daughter of a lesbian couple (Annette Bening and Julianne Moore) who was conceived via artificial insemination. At her younger brother's (Josh Hutcherson) request, she seeks out their biological father (Mark Ruffalo).[39] During shooting, she successfully campaigned to have Joni wear pajamas in several home scenes, as a nod to what the actress herself regularly did while home in Australia.[40] She explained to Orlando Sentinel film critic Roger Moore, "[Joni's] very comfortable in her place, with who she is. So I pushed to have her, whenever she was at home, in her pajamas. That’s comfortable! And that’s something I do."[41]
On 25 October, Wasikowska was honored with the Hollywood Awards' Breakthrough Actress Award,[42] which was presented to her by Bryce Dallas Howard,[43] and she won the Australian Film Institute International Award for Best Actress on 12 December for her performance in [44] According to Forbes, Alice in Wonderland was amongst the highest-grossing films of 2010 with $1.03 billion.[45] As of October 2013, it is the fifteenth highest-grossing film of all time.
From March to May 2010, Wasikowska filmed Cary Fukunaga's adaptation of Jane Eyre, in which she starred as the title character opposite Michael Fassbender as Mr. Rochester.[46] She began reading the novel after completion of Alice in Wonderland, during which she asked her agent if a script existed. Two months later, she received a script and was asked to meet with Fukunaga.[47] However, since Fukunaga was unfamiliar with her prior work at the time and was therefore undecided about casting her, he later sought the opinion of director Gus Van Sant, with whom Wasikowska had previously filmed the 2011 release Restless.[48] He said to BlackBook magazine in February 2011, "Gus wrote back: 'Cast her.'"[17] Her work on the film resulted in a scheduling conflict that forced her to withdraw from the lead in Julia Leigh's 2011 Australian independent film Sleeping Beauty, and she was replaced by Emily Browning.[49][50] Meryl Streep in her 2012 Golden Globe acceptance speech, announced: "How about Mia Wasikowska in Jane Eyre?"[51]
Wasikowska turned down a part in Robert Redford's 2011 film The Conspirator in order to play the female lead in Restless,[52] which she filmed from November to December 2009. The portrayal of her character, a terminally ill sixteen-year-old, required her to crop her long hair.[52] Though she was one of many names shortlisted for consideration in casting the role of Lisbeth Salander in David Fincher's 2011 adaptation of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, she declined to audition for the part due to the time commitment involved with the production.[53] From December 2010 to February 2011, Wasikowska filmed Rodrigo Garcia's Albert Nobbs, for which she was a last-minute replacement for Amanda Seyfried.[54]
On 21 April 2011, Wasikowska was named to the Time 100, a listing of the world's most influential people, which featured a brief essay written by Albert Nobbs co-star Glenn Close.[55] In June, Wasikowska was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[56] In December, she was among a group of actors who filmed a series of shorts from The New York Times titled Touch of Evil, which honored the art of cinematic villainy.[57]
In 2011, Wasikowska shot the small supporting role of Shia LaBeouf's character's love interest in John Hillcoat's Lawless.[58] Later in the year, she filmed the lead in Park Chan-wook's English-language debut, Stoker, from 31 August to 23 October.[59][60] Lawless premiered at Cannes in May 2012, while Stoker debuted at Sundance in January 2013. Wasikowska appeared in Miu Miu's spring 2012 fashion campaign.[61] In 2012, she made her second appearance in a Vanity Fair Hollywood Issue, this time on the front panel.[62]
Filming of her next project, Richard Ayoade's The Double, began in the UK in May 2012.[63] In July, she shot Jim Jarmusch's vampire drama Only Lovers Left Alive, in which she plays the younger sister of Tilda Swinton's character.[64][65] Filming of Tracks, director John Curran's adaptation of the Robyn Davidson memoir of the same name, began in October 2012 in Australia, with Wasikowska in the lead role.[66][67] The film was screened in competition at the 2013 Venice Film Festival.
Wasikowska made her directorial debut on a segment of a film adaptation of The Turning, a collection of short stories by Australian author Tim Winton.[68] The film premiered in August 2013 at the Melbourne International Film Festival. In July 2013, Wasikowska began filming David Cronenberg's Maps to the Stars in Toronto.[69] She will play the title role in Sophie Barthes' film adaptation of Madame Bovary,[70] which began shooting on 30 September in Normandy, France.[71]
In 2013, Wasikowska replaced Emma Stone in the upcoming horror film directed by Guillermo del Toro titled Crimson Peak. She will appear alongside Charlie Hunnam, Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain. The film is set to start shooting in February 2014 with an October 2015 release date.[72][73]
Wasikowska has been cast to reprise the role of Alice in the sequel to Alice in Wonderland, which is scheduled to be released in May 2016.[74]
In her spare time, Wasikowska is an avid photographer,[75] often chronicling her travels and capturing images of her film sets with a Rolleiflex camera.[76] During production of Jane Eyre, she had a secret pocket sewn into one of her costumes in order to conceal a smaller digital camera that she used between takes.[77] One of her on-set images, featuring Fukunaga and Jane Eyre costar Jamie Bell, was selected as a finalist in the 2011 National Photographic Portrait Prize hosted by Australia's National Portrait Gallery on 24 February 2011.[78]

          Mia is an Australian born actress. She was born and raised in the country's capital Canberra. She is the middle child of three children. She has an older sister, Jess, and a younger brother, Kai. Her parents are both photographers. Her mother is Polish and her father is Australian. At age 8, her family moved to Poland for a year. At age 9, Mia took ballet classes with dreams of becoming a professional ballerina. However, an injury prevented this from happening and she quit at age 14. Mia turned to acting, having been excited by European and Australian cinema. She was attending Canberra High School, but left to pursue her career as an actor. She had just turned 15 when she landed the role of Lilya in Suburban Mayhem (2006). Her breakthrough role came when she was cast as Alice in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland (2010).
      Completed school via the Karabar High School Distance Education Centre, a form of correspondence school based in Queanbeyan, New South Wales, Australia, just outside of Canberra, so that she could continue acting while still in High School.
      Tied with Alice in Wonderland (2010) co-star Johnny Depp as the second highest-grossing actor of 2010, behind Leonardo DiCaprio.
      I just wanted to try a different type of performance - ballet is more an image of perfection, and film can show a grittier side. Sometimes it's the more realistic topic of real life that really intrigues me.
      When I decided to pursue acting at 15, I heard that you had to have an agent to do film and television, so I did a Google search for acting agencies in Sydney. I hounded one to take me on and started auditioning. I did some films in Australia, and then I started working in America on In Treatment (2008) when I was 17.
      [on Jane Eyre (2011)] The challenge is that the book, start to finish, is Jane Eyre's internal monologue - everything we know is because of what we're hearing directly from her. So my concern was 'How do we keep that intensity?' I was excited about seeing how we could portray all that's going on inside, all that she's observing and feeling, thinking.
      What I like about film is it explores imperfections. That was something that really attracted me.
      I really love doing things that are different and challenge me in different ways. And I think to remain interested and excited by acting it's really great to have such diverse opportunities, and I feel really lucky that I've been able to do that so far.
      It's never been about the blockbusters and making a huge ton of money. It's always been about wanting to do projects about the things that I think are important to be out there, because there's a lot of stuff that probably doesn't need to be.
      My earliest childhood memory is walking down the corridor with my sister Jess in the middle of the night to see my brother Kai being born in the living room.
      It's so unsatisfying to play a nice, sweet girl. It's so dreadfully boring and almost painful! I like to play characters who have their own fire.
      I didn't have a typical teenagehood so I have a lot of repressed rebellious teen left over. Every now and then I'll act out in some unusual way.
      Fourteen is that wonderful time in your life when you feel such extremes of emotions, you can feel the most incredible elation. It's when everything is still possible. It was this little adventure for me.

Mia Wasikowska, born in Canberra, Australia, trained to be a dancer as a young girl, but gave up a promising career at the age of 15 in order to pursue acting. Her first break came in 2004 when she was cast in two episodes of the Australian soap opera, All Saints. She then appeared in several Australian films, including Suburban Mayhem (2006), which earned her a Young Actor's Award nomination by the Australian Film Institute. 
Some of the blonde beauty's key movie roles since then include playing a Jew hiding in the forests of Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe in Defiance (2008) with Daniel Craig, and a young fan of Amelia Earhart's in the biopic Amelia (2009), starring Hilary Swank. But Wasikowska is perhaps best known for her work in the HBO drama In Treatment. Playing Sophie, a suicidal gymnast seeking help from a therapist (Gabriel Byrne), Wasikowska made entertainment critics take note of her great talent. She was able to create a character so memorable that the New York Times listed her portrayal of Sophie as one of the most riveting performances of the 2008 television season and saw her listed as one of the top ten actors to watch in 2008 by Variety Magazine. 
In 2008, Wasikowska beat out several actresses for the chance to fall down the rabbit hole as the lead character in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland (2010)the much-anticipated 3-D fantasy co-starring Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter. Next, she adopted a British accent to play Charlotte Brontë's classic heroine, Jane Eyre (2011), alongside Michael Fassbender, followed by Oscar winner Albert Nobbs (2011) and the western Lawless (2012). Most recently, she starred in Only Lovers Left Alive (2014). 
The actress, who is of Polish descent, admits that she liked to mimic people as a child and was able to adopt an impressive American accent through watching American television in Australia.

 News & Updates    About Mia Wasikowska    Career    Photogallery    Website    Links    Twitter     Facebook 
Mia Wasikowska was born and raised in Canberra, Australia, and is the middle child of three, with an older sister, Jess, and a younger brother, Kai. Her mother, Marzena Wasikowska, is a Polish-born photographer, while her father, John Reid, is an Australian photographer and collagist. In 1998, when she was eight years old, Mia Wasikowska and her family moved to Szczecin, Poland for a year, after her mother received a grant to produce a collection of work based on her experience of having emigrated to Australia in 1974 at the age of eleven. Mia Wasikowska and her siblings took part in the production as subjects; she explained to Johanna Schneller of the Toronto Globe and Mail in July 2010, “We never had to smile or perform. We weren’t always conscious of being photographed. We’d just do our thing, and she’d take pictures of us.”

Her passion for ballet also waned due to the increasing pressure to achieve physical perfection and her growing dissatisfaction with the industry in general, and she quit at fourteen. However, she credits ballet with improving her ability to handle her nerves in auditions.
At the same time, she had been exposed to European and Australian cinema at an early age, particularly Krzysztof Kie?lowski’s Three Colors trilogy and Gillian Armstrong’s My Brilliant Career. Although she was shy and averse to performing during her school years, she became inspired to break into acting after watching Holly Hunter in The Piano and Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence, in addition to the opportunity of exploring imperfections in film. Despite having no prior acting experience, Mia looked up twelve Australian talent agencies on Google and contacted them all, receiving only one response; she successfully arranged a meeting following persistent callbacks.
Mia landed her first acting role in 2004, with a two-episode stint on the Australian soap All Saints. She had just turned fifteen when she was cast in her Australian film debut, 2006′s Suburban Mayhem, for which she received a nomination for a Young Actor’s AFI Award. That same year, she also appeared in her first short film, Lens Love Story, in which she had no dialogue.
In 2007, Mia appeared in the crocodile horror film Rogue, alongside Radha Mitchell and Sam Worthington, and the drama September, for which she beat out nearly 200 other actresses by receiving her part on the spot by director Peter Carstairs following her audition. She then starred in Spencer Susser’s acclaimed short film I Love Sarah Jane, which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.
At the age of seventeen, Mia received her first break in the United States when she was cast as Sophie, a suicidal gymnast, in HBO’s acclaimed weekly drama In Treatment, after she auditioned for the role by videotape. The part required her to leave school in Canberra and move to Los Angeles for three months, while enrolling in correspondence courses. She earned critical acclaim for her performance as the troubled teenager treated by psychotherapist Paul Weston (Gabriel Byrne), which included praise for her excellent American accent. Mia revealed in an October 2008 interview with Variety that she was something of a mimic as a child and that the large influx of American films and TV shows made it easier for Australians to pick up the accent.
The exposure from the show led to Mia picking up her first American film appearances. She played the brief role of Chaya, the young forest wife of Asael Bielski (Jamie Bell), in Defiance. Director Edward Zwick cast her without having seen her in In Treatment, explaining to the Australian edition of Vogue, “Her inner life is so vivid that it comes across even when she’s being still.” Her next part was that of aviation pioneer Elinor Smith in Mira Nair’s 2009 biopic Amelia. In June 2008, due to her work on In Treatment, she was a recipient of an Australians in Film Breakthrough Award.
Mia played the supporting role of Pamela Choat in the 2009 Southern Gothic independent film That Evening Sun, opposite Hal Holbrook. Director Scott Teems, seeking a young actress who bore a resemblance to Sissy Spacek, initially balked at the casting director’s first suggestion of Mia for the part, as he was adamant at casting all native Southerners for the sake of authenticity. However, after auditions with other actresses were unsuccessful, Teems relented and summoned Wasikowska for auditioning. She had only two hours to prepare, which she spent watching clips of Coal Miner’s Daughter online in order to quickly learn a Southern accent, and impressed Teems enough that she gained the distinction of being the only non-American actor cast in the film. She was nominated for a 2009 Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female, which she lost to Mo’Nique (Precious), though the film received a South by Southwest award for Best Ensemble Cast.
In July 2008, after a lengthy search, Mia was cast as the eponymous heroine in Tim Burton’s retelling of Alice in Wonderland, alongside Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway. She sent a videotaped audition to casting directors in London, and her first live reading in Los Angeles occurred on the same day as her Evening Sun audition. After three more auditions in London – which saw her flying back and forth from Australia to England in just as many weeks – she was awarded the role. Burton cited Mia’s “old-soul quality” as a catalyst in casting her: “Because you’re witnessing this whole thing through her eyes, it needed somebody who can subtly portray that.” Mia portrayed a nineteen-year-old Alice returning to Wonderland for the first time since her youth after escaping an unwanted marriage proposal. Her affinity for the character played a part in her desire for the role, as she had read the Lewis Carroll books as a child and was a fan of Jan Švankmajer’s 1988 stop-motion film Alice. She also saw Burton’s version of the classic story as a chance to explore a deeper characterization of Alice, to whom she felt young women her age could relate, for which she drew on personal experiences. “Alice has a certain discomfort within herself, within society and among her peers; I [...] have definitely felt similarly about all of those things, so I could really understand her not fitting in. Alice also [is] an observer who is thinking a lot, and that’s similar to how I am.”
For Lisa Cholodenko’s indie comedy The Kids Are All Right, Mia was cast as Joni, the bookish daughter of a lesbian couple (Annette Bening and Julianne Moore) who was conceived via artificial insemination. At her younger brother’s (Josh Hutcherson) request, she seeks out their biological father (Mark Ruffalo). During shooting, she successfully campaigned to have Joni wear pajamas in several home scenes, as a nod to what the actress regularly did herself while home in Australia. She explained to Orlando Sentinel film critic Roger Moore, “[Joni's] very comfortable in her place, with who she is. So I pushed to have her, whenever she was at home, in her pajamas. That’s comfortable! And that’s something I do.”
On 25 October, Mia was honored with the Hollywood Awards’ Breakthrough Actress Award, which was presented to her by Bryce Dallas Howard, and she won the Australian Film Institute International Award for Best Actress on 12 December for her performance in Alice in Wonderland. She was recognized by Forbes as one of the highest-grossing actors of 2010 with $1.03 billion, tied for second position with Johnny Depp and behind leader Leonardo DiCaprio, whose films grossed $1.1 billion for the year.
From March to May 2010, Mia filmed Cary Fukunaga’s adaptation of Jane Eyre, in which she starred as the title character opposite Michael Fassbender as Mr. Rochester. She began reading the novel after completion of Alice in Wonderland, during which she asked her agent if a script existed. Two months later, she received a script and was asked to meet with Fukunaga. However, since Fukunaga was unfamiliar with her prior work at the time and was therefore undecided about casting her, he later sought the opinion of director Gus Van Sant, with whom Mia had previously filmed the 2011 release Restless. He said to BlackBook magazine in February 2011, “Gus wrote back: ‘Cast her.’” Her work on the film resulted in a scheduling conflict that forced her to withdraw from the lead in Julia Leigh’s 2011 Australian independent film Sleeping Beauty, and she was replaced by Emily Browning. Meryl Streep in her 2012 Golden Globe acceptance speech, announced: “How about Mia Wasikowska in Jane Eyre?”
Mia turned down a part in Robert Redford’s 2011 film The Conspirator in order to play the female lead in Restless, which she filmed from November to December 2009. The portrayal of her character, a terminally ill sixteen-year-old, required her to crop her long hair. Though she was one of many names shortlisted for the role of Lisbeth Salander in David Fincher’s 2011 adaptation of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, she declined to audition for the part due to the time commitment involved with the production. From December 2010 to February 2011, Mia filmed Rodrigo Garcia’s Albert Nobbs, for which she was a last-minute replacement for Amanda Seyfried.
On 21 April 2011, Mia was named to the Time 100, a listing of the world’s most influential people, which featured a brief essay written by Albert Nobbs co-star Glenn Close. In June 2011, Mia was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In December 2011, she appeared in The New York Times’ short film on cinematic villainy, Touch of Evil.
In 2011, Mia shot a supporting role in John Hillcoat’s Prohibition-era drama Lawless as the love interest of star Shia LaBeouf; production wrapped in April 2011. Later in the year, she filmed the lead in Park Chan-wook’s English-language debut, Stoker, from 31 August to 23 October. Both films are scheduled for release in 2012.
Filming of her next project, Richard Ayoade’s The Double, began in the U.K. in May 2012. She will star in Jim Jarmusch’s vampire drama Only Lovers Left Alive, which will begin production in Germany in 2012. Mia will portray the title character in Sophie Barthes’s film adaptation of Madame Bovary, scheduled to begin production in autumn 2012 in Europe. She will also play the lead in director John Curran’s adaptation of Australian author Robyn Davidson’s Tracks; filming is scheduled for autumn 2012 in Australia. Mia is also confirmed to star alongside Cate Blanchett in Carol, an adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s The Price of Salt, set to shoot in February 2013 in London and New York.
Mia will make her directorial debut on a segment of a film adaptation of The Turning, a collection of short stories by Australian author Tim Winton.
Mia appears in Miu Miu’s spring 2012 fashion campaign. In 2012, she made her second appearance in a Vanity Fair Hollywood Issue, this time on the front panel.
In her spare time, Mia is an avid photographer, often chronicling her travels and capturing images of her film sets with a Rolleiflex camera. During production of Jane Eyre, she had a secret pocket sewn into one of her costumes in order to conceal a smaller digital camera that she used between takes. One of her on-set images, featuring Fukunaga and Jane Eyre costar Jamie Bell, was selected as a finalist in a competition hosted by Australia’s National Portrait Gallery on 24 February 2011.
Mia continues to make her home in Canberra with her family between projects. When asked by PopEater in March 2011 if she was treated like a celebrity at home, she replied, “No, I still take the rubbish out and empty the dishwasher. It’s good going back for that reason.”
