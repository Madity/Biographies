Joanne Rowling was born in July 1965 at Yate General Hospital in England and grew up in Chepstow, Gwent where she went to Wyedean Comprehensive.
Jo left Chepstow for Exeter University, where she earned a French and Classics degree, her course including one year in Paris. As a postgraduate she moved to London and worked as a researcher at Amnesty International among other jobs. She started writing the Harry Potter series during a delayed Manchester to London King’s Cross train journey, and during the next five years, outlined the plots for each book and began writing the first novel.
Jo then moved to northern Portugal, where she taught English as a foreign language. She married in October 1992 and gave birth to a daughter in 1993. When the marriage ended, she and Jessica returned to the UK to live in Edinburgh, where Harry Potter & the Philosopher’s Stone was eventually completed. The book was first published by Bloomsbury Children’s Books in June 1997, under the name J.K. Rowling. The “K”, for Kathleen, her paternal grandmother’s name was added at her publisher’s request who thought that a woman’s name would not appeal to the target audience of young boys.
The second title in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was published in July 1998 and was No. 1 in the adult hardback bestseller charts for a month after publication.  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was published on 8th July 1999 to worldwide acclaim and spent four weeks at No.1 in the UK adult hardback bestseller charts.
The fourth book in the series, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was published on 8th July 2000 with a record first print run of 1 million copies for the UK. It quickly broke all records for the greatest number of books sold on the first day of publication in the UK.
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was published in Britain, the USA, Canada and Australia on 21st June 2003 and broke the records set by Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire as the fastest selling book in history. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was published in the UK, US and other English-speaking countries on 16th July 2005 and also achieved record sales.
The seventh and final book in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was published in the UK, US and other English speaking countries in 2007.
J.K. Rowling has also written two small volumes, which appear as the titles of Harry’s school books within the novels. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through The Ages were published in March 2001 in aid of Comic Relief.
In December 2008, The Tales of Beedle the Bard was published in aid of the Children’s High Level Group (now Lumos).
As well as an OBE for services to children’s literature, J.K. Rowling is the recipient of numerous awards and honorary degrees including the Prince of Asturias Award for Concord, France’s Légion d’Honneur, and the Hans Christian Andersen Literature Award, and she has been a Commencement Speaker at Harvard University USA. She supports a wide number of charitable causes through her charitable trust Volant, and is the founder of Lumos, a charity working to transform the lives of disadvantaged children.
In 2012, J.K. Rowling published her first novel for adults, The Casual Vacancy (Little Brown), which has now been published in 44 languages.
J.K. Rowling has also written The Cuckoo's Calling (Little Brown), her first crime novel under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, which was published in 2013 and is to be translated into 37 languages.   A second Robert Galbraith novel is due to be published in 2014.
J.K. Rowling is currently writing the screen play, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, an original story set in the wizarding world, some of which will be familiar to Harry Potter fans.   It marks her screenwriting debut and the start of a new film series with Warner Bros.
=======================================================
Joanne "Jo" Rowling, OBE FRSL[3] (/ˈroʊlɪŋ/; born 31 July 1965[4]), pen names J. K. Rowling[5] and Robert Galbraith, is a British novelist best known as the author of the Harry Potter fantasy series. The Harry Potter books have gained worldwide attention, won multiple awards, and sold more than 400 million copies.[6] They have become the best-selling book series in history[7] and been the basis for a series of films which became the highest-grossing film series in history.[8] Rowling had overall approval on the scripts[9] and maintained creative control by serving as a producer on the final instalment.[10]
Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990.[11] The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, divorce from her first husband and relative poverty until Rowling finished the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (1997). Rowling subsequently published 6 sequels—the last, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007)—as well as 3 supplements to the series. Since then, Rowling has parted with her agency and resumed writing for adult readership, releasing the tragicomedy The Casual Vacancy (2012) and—using the pseudonym Robert Galbraith—the crime fiction novel The Cuckoo's Calling (2013), the first of a series.[12]
Rowling has led a "rags to riches" life story, in which she progressed from living on state benefits to multi-millionaire status within five years. She is the United Kingdom's best-selling author since records began, with sales in excess of £238m.[13] The 2008 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at £560 million ($798 million), ranking her as the twelfth richest woman in the United Kingdom.[14] Forbes ranked Rowling as the forty-eighth most powerful celebrity of 2007,[15] and TIME magazine named her as a runner-up for its 2007 Person of the Year, noting the social, moral, and political inspiration she has given her fans.[16] In October 2010, Rowling was named the "Most Influential Woman in Britain" by leading magazine editors.[17] She has become a notable philanthropist, supporting such charities as Comic Relief, One Parent Families, Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Lumos (formerly the Children's High Level Group).
Although she writes under the pen name "J. K. Rowling" (pronounced rolling),[18] the author's name when her first Harry Potter book was published was simply "Joanne Rowling". Anticipating that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers asked that she use two initials, rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for "Kathleen") as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother.[19] She calls herself "Jo" and has said, "No one ever called me 'Joanne' when I was young, unless they were angry."[20] Following her marriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business.[21][22] During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of Joanne Kathleen Rowling.[23] In a 2012 interview, Rowling noted that she no longer cared that people pronounced her name incorrectly.[24]
Rowling's parents met on a train from King's Cross Station. After Rowling used King's Cross as a gateway into the Wizarding World, it has since become a popular tourist spot.
Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer,[25] and Anne Rowling (née Volant), on 31 July 1965 in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Bristol.[26] Her mother Anne was half-French and half-Scottish. Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964.[27] They married on 14 March 1965.[27] Her mother's maternal grandfather, Dugald Campbell, was born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran.[28] Her mother's paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was awarded the Croix de Guerre for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during the First World War. Rowling originally believed he had won the Légion d'honneur during the war, as she said when she received it herself in 2009. She later discovered the truth when featuring in an episode of the UK genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?.[29][30][31] Volant worked as a head wine waiter at the Savoy Hotel in London during the 1920s, for which he was appointed a Chevalier of the Order of Agricultural Merit.
Rowling's sister Dianne[11] was born at their home when Rowling was 23 months old.[26] The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when Rowling was four.[32] She attended St Michael's Primary School, a school founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer Hannah More.[33][34] Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the Harry Potter headmaster Albus Dumbledore.[35]
As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she would usually then read to her sister. She recalls that "I can still remember me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole and was fed strawberries by the rabbit family inside it. Certainly the first story I ever wrote down (when I was five or six) was about a rabbit called Rabbit. He got the measles and was visited by his friends, including a giant bee called Miss Bee."[18] At the age of nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales.[26] When she was a young teenager, her great aunt, who Rowling said "taught classics and approved of a thirst for knowledge, even of a questionable kind", gave her a very old copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, Hons and Rebels.[36] Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and Rowling subsequently read all of her books.[37]
Rowling has said of her teenage years, in an interview with The New Yorker, "I wasn't particularly happy. I think it's a dreadful time of life."[25] She had a difficult homelife; her mother was ill and she had a difficult relationship with her father (she is no longer on speaking terms with him).[25] She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, where her mother had worked as a technician in the science department.[38] Rowling said of her adolescence, "Hermione [a bookish, know-it-all Harry Potter character] is loosely based on me. She's a caricature of me when I was eleven, which I'm not particularly proud of."[39] Steve Eddy, who taught Rowling English when she first arrived, remembers her as "not exceptional" but "one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English".[25] Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth owned a turquoise Ford Anglia, which she says inspired a flying version that appeared in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. "Ron Weasley [Harry Potter's best friend] isn't a living portrait of Sean, but he really is very Sean-ish."[40] Of her musical tastes of the time, she said "My favourite group in the world is The Smiths. And when I was going through a punky phase, it was The Clash."[41] Rowling studied A Levels in English, French and German,[42] achieving two A's and a B[27] and was Head Girl.[25]
In 1982, Rowling took the entrance exams for Oxford University but was not accepted[25] and read for a BA in French and Classics at the University of Exeter, which she says was a "bit of a shock" as she "was expecting to be amongst lots of similar people – thinking radical thoughts". Once she made friends with "some like-minded people" she says she began to enjoy herself.[43] Of her time at Exeter, Martin Sorrell, then a professor of French at the university, recalled "a quietly competent student, with a denim jacket and dark hair, who, in academic terms, gave the appearance of doing what was necessary".[25] Although her own memory is of "doing no work whatsoever" and instead she "wore heavy eyeliner, listened to the Smiths, and read Dickens and Tolkien".[25] After a year of study in Paris, Rowling graduated from Exeter in 1986[25] and moved to London to work as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International.[44] In 1988, Rowling wrote a short-essay about her time studying Classics entitled "What was the Name of that Nymph Again? or Greek and Roman Studies Recalled"; it was published by the University of Exeter's journal Pegasus.[45]
After working at Amnesty International in London, Rowling and her then boyfriend decided to move to Manchester.[26] In 1990, while she was on a four-hour-delayed train trip from Manchester to London, the idea for a story of a young boy attending a school of wizardry "came fully formed" into her mind.[46] She told The Boston Globe that "I really don't know where the idea came from. It started with Harry, then all these characters and situations came flooding into my head."[26][46]
I was travelling back to London on my own on a crowded train, and the idea for Harry Potter simply fell into my head. I had been writing almost continuously since the age of six but I had never been so excited about an idea before. To my immense frustration, I didn't have a pen that worked, and I was too shy to ask anybody if I could borrow one… I did not have a functioning pen with me, but I do think that this was probably a good thing. I simply sat and thought, for four (delayed train) hours, while all the details bubbled up in my brain, and this scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard became more and more real to me. Perhaps, if I had slowed down the ideas to capture them on paper, I might have stifled some of them (although sometimes I do wonder, idly, how much of what I imagined on that journey I had forgotten by the time I actually got my hands on a pen). I began to write 'Philosopher's Stone' that very evening, although those first few pages bear no resemblance to anything in the finished book.
When she had reached her Clapham Junction flat, she began to write immediately.[26][48] In December of that year, Rowling's mother died, after ten years suffering from multiple sclerosis.[26] Rowling commented, "I was writing Harry Potter at the moment my mother died. I had never told her about Harry Potter."[22] Rowling said this death heavily affected her writing[22] and that she introduced much more detail about Harry's loss in the first book, because she knew about how it felt.[49]
An advert in The Guardian[27] led Rowling to move to Porto in Portugal to teach English as a foreign language.[11][37] She taught at night, and began writing in the day while listening to Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto.[25] While there she met Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes in a bar, after sharing a mutual interest in Jane Austen.[27] They married on 16 October 1992 and their child, Jessica Isabel Rowling Arantes (named after Jessica Mitford), was born on 27 July 1993 in Portugal.[27] Rowling had previously suffered a miscarriage.[27] The couple separated on 17 November 1993,[27][50] 13 months and one day after their marriage.[27] Biographers have suggested that Rowling suffered domestic abuse during her marriage, although the full extent is unknown.[27][51] In an interview with The Daily Express, Arantes said on their final night together he had dragged her out of their home at five in the morning and slapped her hard.[25] In December 1993, Rowling and her daughter moved to be near Rowling's sister in Edinburgh, Scotland,[26] with three chapters of Harry Potter in her suitcase.[25]
Seven years after graduating from university, Rowling saw herself as "the biggest failure I knew".[52] Her marriage had failed, she was jobless with a dependent child, but she described her failure as liberating:
Failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy to finishing the only work that mattered to me. Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one area where I truly belonged. I was set free, because my greatest fear had been realized, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter, and a big idea. And so rock bottom became a solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.
During this period Rowling was diagnosed with clinical depression, and contemplated suicide.[53] Her illness inspired the characters known as Dementors, soul-sucking creatures introduced in the third book.[54] Rowling signed up for welfare benefits, describing her economic status as being "poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless".[25][52]
Rowling was left in "despair" after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter.[27] She obtained an order of restraint and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994.[27] She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University,[55] after completing her first novel while having survived on state benefits.[56] She wrote in many cafés, especially Nicolson's Café,[57] and The Elephant House,[58] (the former owned by her brother-in-law Roger Moore)[59] wherever she could get Jessica to fall asleep.[26][60] In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local cafés to escape from her unheated flat, remarking, "I am not stupid enough to rent an unheated flat in Edinburgh in midwinter. It had heating." Instead, as she stated on the American TV programme A&E Biography, one of the reasons she wrote in cafés was because taking her baby out for a walk was the best way to make her fall asleep.[60]
"The Elephant House" – one of the cafés in Edinburgh in which Rowling wrote the first Harry Potter novel.[61]
In 1995, Rowling finished her manuscript for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone on an old manual typewriter.[62] Upon the enthusiastic response of Bryony Evens, a reader who had been asked to review the book's first three chapters, the Fulham-based Christopher Little Literary Agents agreed to represent Rowling in her quest for a publisher. The book was submitted to twelve publishing houses, all of which rejected the manuscript.[27] A year later she was finally given the green light (and a £1500 advance) by editor Barry Cunningham from Bloomsbury, a publishing house in London.[27][63] The decision to publish Rowling's book apparently owes much to Alice Newton, the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chairman, who was given the first chapter to review by her father and immediately demanded the next.[64] Although Bloomsbury agreed to publish the book, Cunningham says that he advised Rowling to get a day job, since she had little chance of making money in children's books.[65] Soon after, in 1997, Rowling received an £8000 grant from the Scottish Arts Council to enable her to continue writing.[66]
In June 1997, Bloomsbury published Philosopher's Stone with an initial print run of 1,000 copies, 500 of which were distributed to libraries. Today, such copies are valued between £16,000 and £25,000.[67] Five months later, the book won its first award, a Nestlé Smarties Book Prize. In February, the novel won the prestigious British Book Award for Children's Book of the Year, and later, the Children's Book Award. In early 1998, an auction was held in the United States for the rights to publish the novel, and was won by Scholastic Inc., for $105,000. In Rowling's own words, she "nearly died" when she heard the news.[68] In October 1998, Scholastic published Philosopher's Stone in the US under the title of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, a change Rowling claims she now regrets and would have fought if she had been in a better position at the time.[69] Rowling moved from her flat with the money from the Scholastic sale, into 19 Hazelbank Terrace in Edinburgh. Her neighbours were initially unaware that she was the author of the Harry Potter series, although according to biographer Connie Ann Kirk, "most treated her with respect and gave her the distance they would want themselves".[59]
Its sequel, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was published in July 1998 and again Rowling won the Smarties Prize.[70] In December 1999, the third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, won the Smarties Prize, making Rowling the first person to win the award three times running.[71] She later withdrew the fourth Harry Potter novel from contention to allow other books a fair chance. In January 2000, Prisoner of Azkaban won the inaugural Whitbread Children's Book of the Year award, though it lost the Book of the Year prize to Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf.[72]
The fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, was released simultaneously in the UK and the US on 8 July 2000 and broke sales records in both countries. Some 372,775 copies of the book were sold in its first day in the UK, almost equalling the number Prisoner of Azkaban sold during its first year.[73] In the US, the book sold three million copies in its first 48 hours, smashing all literary sales records.[73] Rowling admitted that she had had a moment of crisis while writing the novel; "Halfway through writing Four, I realised there was a serious fault with the plot ... I've had some of my blackest moments with this book ... One chapter I rewrote 13 times, though no-one who has read it can spot which one or know the pain it caused me."[74] Rowling was named Author of the Year in the 2000 British Book Awards.[75]
A wait of three years occurred between the release of Goblet of Fire and the fifth Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. This gap led to press speculation that Rowling had developed writer's block, speculations she fervently denied.[76] Rowling later admitted that writing the book was a chore. "I think Phoenix could have been shorter", she told Lev Grossman, "I knew that, and I ran out of time and energy toward the end."[77]
The sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was released on 16 July 2005. It too broke all sales records, selling nine million copies in its first 24 hours of release.[78] While writing, she told a fan online, "Book six has been planned for years, but before I started writing seriously I spend two months re-visiting the plan and making absolutely sure I knew what I was doing."[79] She noted on her website that the opening chapter of book six, which features a conversation between the Minister of Magic and the British Prime Minister, had been intended as the first chapter first for Philosopher's Stone, then Chamber of Secrets, and then Prisoner of Azkaban.[80] In 2006, Half-Blood Prince received the Book of the Year prize at the British Book Awards.[70]
The title of the seventh and final Harry Potter book was revealed on 21 December 2006 to be Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.[81] In February 2007 it was reported that Rowling wrote on a bust in her hotel room at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh that she had finished the seventh book in that room on 11 January 2007.[82] Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released on 21 July 2007 (0:01 BST)[83] and broke its predecessor's record as the fastest-selling book of all time.[84] It sold 11 million copies in the first day of release in the United Kingdom and United States.[84] She wrote the last chapter of the book "in something like 1990", as part of her earliest work on the entire series.[85] During a year period when Rowling was completing the last book, she allowed herself to be filmed for a documentary which aired in Britain on ITV on 30 December 2007. It was entitled J K Rowling... A Year in the Life and showed her returning to her old Edinburgh tenement flat where she had lived and completed the first Harry Potter book.[86] Re-visiting the flat for the first time reduced her to tears, saying it was "really where I turned my life around completely".[86]
In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Rowling gave credit to her mother for the success of the series saying that "the books are what they are because she died...because I loved her and she died".[87]
Harry Potter is now a global brand worth an estimated $15 billion,[88] and the last four Harry Potter books have consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history.[84][89] The series, totalling 4,195 pages,[90] has been translated, in whole or in part, into 65 languages.[91]
The Harry Potter books have also gained recognition for sparking an interest in reading among the young at a time when children were thought to be abandoning books for computers and television,[92] although it is reported that despite the huge uptake of the books, adolescent reading has continued to decline.[93]
In October 1998, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights to the first two novels for a seven-figure sum.[94] A film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was released on 16 November 2001, and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on 15 November 2002.[95] Both films were directed by Chris Columbus. 4 June 2004 saw the release of the film version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, directed by Alfonso Cuarón. The fourth film, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, was directed by another new director, Mike Newell, and released on 18 November 2005. The film of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was released on 11 July 2007.[95] David Yates directed, and Michael Goldenberg wrote the screenplay, having taken over the position from Steve Kloves. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was released on 15 July 2009.[96] David Yates directed again, and Kloves returned to write the script.[97] In March 2008, Warner Bros. announced that the final instalment of the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, would be filmed in two segments, with part one being released in November 2010 and part two being released in July 2011. Yates would again return to direct both films.[98][99]
Warner Bros took considerable notice of Rowling's desires and thoughts when drafting her contract. One of her principal stipulations was the films be shot in Britain with an all-British cast,[100] which has been generally adhered to, with the majority of the actors selected from Britain. In an unprecedented move, Rowling also demanded that Coca-Cola, the victor in the race to tie in their products to the film series, donate $18 million to the American charity Reading is Fundamental, as well as a number of community charity programs.[101]
The first four, sixth and seventh films were scripted by Steve Kloves; Rowling assisted him in the writing process, ensuring that his scripts did not contradict future books in the series. She has said that she told him more about the later books than anybody else (prior to their release), but not everything.[102] She also told Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) certain secrets about their characters before they were revealed in the books.[103] Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) asked her if Harry died at any point in the series; Rowling answered him by saying, "You have a death scene", thereby not explicitly answering the question.[104] Director Steven Spielberg was approached to helm the first film, but dropped out. The press has repeatedly claimed that Rowling played a role in his departure, but Rowling stated that she has no say in who directs the films and would not have vetoed Spielberg if she had.[105] Rowling's first choice for the director had been Monty Python member Terry Gilliam, as she is a fan of his work, but Warner Bros. wanted a more family-friendly film and chose Columbus.[106]
Rowling had gained some creative control on the films, reviewing all the scripts[107] as well as acting as a producer on the final two-part instalment, Deathly Hallows.[108]
On her website, Rowling revealed that she was considered to have a cameo in the first film as Lily Potter in the Mirror of Erised scene. Rowling turned down the role, stating that she was not cut out to be an actor and, "would have messed it up somehow".[109] The role ultimately went to Geraldine Somerville.
Rowling, producers David Heyman and David Barron, along with directors David Yates, Mike Newell and Alfonso Cuarón collected the Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema at the 2011 British Academy Film Awards in honour of the Harry Potter film franchise.[110]
In September 2013, Warner Bros. announced an "expanded creative partnership" with Rowling, based on a planned series of films about Newt Scamander, author of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The first film will be scripted by Rowling herself, and be set roughly 70 years before the events of the main series.[111] In 2014, an article in the New York Times revealed that the series would consist of three films.[112]
In 2004, Forbes named Rowling as the first person to become a U.S.-dollar billionaire by writing books,[113] the second-richest female entertainer and the 1,062nd richest person in the world.[114] Rowling disputed the calculations and said she had plenty of money, but was not a billionaire.[115] In addition, the 2008 Sunday Times Rich List named Rowling the 144th richest person in Britain.[14] In 2012, Forbes removed Rowling from their rich list, claiming that her over $160 million in charitable donations and the high tax rate in the UK meant she was no longer a billionaire.[116] In February 2013 she was assessed as the 13th most powerful woman in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.[117]
In 2001, Rowling purchased a 19th-century estate house, Killiechassie House, on the banks of the River Tay, near Aberfeldy, in Perth and Kinross, Scotland.[118] Rowling also owns a £4.5 million ($7 million) Georgian house in Kensington, West London,[119] on a street with 24-hour security.[120]
On 26 December 2001, Rowling married Neil Michael Murray (born 30 June 1971), an anaesthetist, in a private ceremony at her home, Killiechassie House, near Aberfeldy.[121]
Rowling's and Murray's son, David Gordon Rowling Murray, was born on 24 March 2003.[122] Shortly after Rowling began writing Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince she took a break from working on the novel to care for him in his early infancy.[123] Rowling's youngest child, daughter Mackenzie Jean Rowling Murray, to whom she dedicated Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was born on 23 January 2005.[124] The family reside in Edinburgh, Scotland[125] near the authors Ian Rankin, Alexander McCall Smith and Kate Atkinson.[126]
In July 2011, Rowling parted company with her agent, Christopher Little, moving to a new agency founded by one of his staff, Neil Blair.[127] Commenting on the move, Rowling said, "Neil and Christopher reached a point where it wasn't working, the two of them together, and I had to make a decision. It was very, very difficult."[25] On 23 February 2012, Rowling's new agency, the Blair Partnership, announced on its website that Rowling was set to publish a new book targeted at adults. In a press release, Rowling noted the differences between her new project and the Potter series, saying, "Although I've enjoyed writing it just as much, my next novel will be very different from the Harry Potter series." On 12 April 2012, Little, Brown and Company announced that the book was entitled The Casual Vacancy and would be released on 27 September 2012.[128] Rowling gave several interviews and made appearances to promote The Casual Vacancy, including at the London Southbank Centre,[129] the Cheltenham Literature Festival,[130] The Charlie Rose Show[131] and the Lennoxlove Book Festival.[132] In its first three weeks of release, The Casual Vacancy sold over 1 million copies worldwide.[133]
On 3 December 2012, it was announced that The Casual Vacancy will become a BBC television drama series expected to air in 2014 on BBC One. The series will be produced by Rowling's agent, Neil Blair, through his independent production company and with Rick Senat serving as executive producer. Rowling is collaborating closely on the adaptation. The number and length of episodes will be decided once the adaptation process has begun.[134][135]
Over the years, Rowling often spoke of writing a crime novel. In 2007, during the Edinburgh Book Festival, author Ian Rankin claimed that his wife spotted Rowling "scribbling away" at a detective novel in a cafe.[136] Rankin later retracted the story, claiming it was a joke,[137] but the rumour persisted, with a report in 2012 in The Guardian speculating that Rowling's next book would be a crime novel.[138] In an interview with Stephen Fry in 2005, Rowling claimed that she would much prefer to write any subsequent books under a pseudonym, but she conceded to Jeremy Paxman in 2003 that if she did, the press would probably "find out in seconds".[139] In a 2012 interview with The New Yorker, Rowling stated she was working on her next adult novel, and that, though she had written only "a couple of chapters", the story "is pretty well plotted".[25]
In April 2013, Little Brown published The Cuckoo's Calling, the purported début novel of author Robert Galbraith, who the publisher described as "a former plainclothes Royal Military Police investigator who had left in 2003 to work in the civilian security industry".[140] The novel, a detective story in which private investigator Cormoran Strike unravels the supposed suicide of a supermodel, sold 1500 copies in hardback (although the matter was not resolved as of 21 July 2013, later reports stated that this number is actually the number of copies that were printed for the first run, while the actual sales total was closer to 500),[141] and received acclaim from other crime writers[140] and critics[142]—a Publisher's Weekly review called the book a "stellar debut",[143] while the Library Journal's mystery section pronounced the novel "the debut of the month".[144]
India Knight, a novelist and columnist for the Sunday Times, tweeted on 9 July 2013 that she had been reading The Cuckoo's Calling and thought it was good for a début novel. In response, a tweeter with the name Jude Callegari said that the author was "Rowling". Knight responded "EH?", but got no further reply.[145] Knight notified Richard Brooks, arts editor of the Sunday Times, who began his own investigation.[145][146] After discovering that Rowling and Galbraith had the same agent and editor, he sent the books for linguistic analysis which found similarities, and subsequently contacted Rowling's agent who confirmed it was Rowling's pseudonym.[146] Within days of Rowling being revealed as the true author, sales of the book rose by 4000 percent,[145] and Little Brown printed an additional 140,000 copies to meet the increase in demand.[147] As of 18 June 2013, a signed copy of the first edition sold for US$4,453 (£2,950), while an unsold signed first-edition copy was being offered for $6,188 (£3,950).[141]
Rowling said "It has been wonderful to publish without hype or expectation and pure pleasure to get feedback under a different name",[148] and confirmed on her website that she "fully intends to keep writing the series" and will do so under the pseudonym.[149] On "Robert Galbraith"'s website, Rowling explained that she took the name from one of her personal heroes, Robert Kennedy, and a childhood fantasy name she had invented for herself, Ella Galbraith.[150]
Soon after the revelation, Brooks pondered whether Jude Callegari could have been Rowling herself as part of wider speculation that the entire affair had been a publicity stunt. Some also noted that many of the writers who had initially praised the book, such as Alex Bray or Val McDermid, were within Rowling's circle of acquaintances; however, both vociferously denied any knowledge of Rowling's authorship.[145] Judith "Jude" Callegari was revealed to be the best-friend of the wife of Chris Gossage, a partner within Russells Solicitors, Rowling's legal representatives.[151][152] Rowling released a statement saying, "To say that I am disappointed is an understatement. I had assumed that I could expect total confidentiality from Russells, a reputable professional firm, and I feel very angry that my trust turned out to be misplaced";[151] Russells apologised "unreservedly" for the leak, confirming it was not part of a marketing stunt and revealed that "the disclosure was made in confidence to someone he [Gossage] trusted implicitly".[147] Rowling has accepted a charitable donation from Russells, which includes reimbursement of her legal costs and a payment to the Soldiers' Charity.[153] On 26 November 2013 the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) issued Gossage a written rebuke and £1000 fine for breaching privacy rules.[154]
Writing on her website in 2013 after her authorship of The Cuckoo's Calling became public, Rowling said, "I've just finished the sequel and we expect it to be published next year."[155] On the 17th February 2014, Rowling announced that the second Cormoran Strike novel, named The Silkworm, would be released in June 2014. It sees Strike investigating the disappearance of a writer hated by many of his old friends for insulting them in his new novel.[156]
In 2006, Rowling revealed that she had finished writing a few short stories and another children's book (a "political fairy story") about a monster, aimed at a younger audience than Harry Potter readers.[157] In July 2007, Rowling said that she wants to dedicate "lots" of her time to her family, but is currently "sort of writing two things", one for children and the other for adults.[158] She did not give any details about the two projects but did state that she was excited because the two book situation reminded her of writing the Philosopher's Stone, explaining how she was then writing two books until Harry took over.[159]
In November 2007, Rowling said that she was working on another book, a "half-finished book for children that I think will probably be the next thing I publish".[160]
In March 2008, Rowling revealed in an interview that she had returned to writing in Edinburgh cafés, intent on composing a new novel for children. "I will continue writing for children because that's what I enjoy", she told The Daily Telegraph. "I am very good at finding a suitable café; I blend into the crowd and, of course, I don't sit in the middle of the bar staring all around me."[161] Rowling also confirmed that her "political fairy tale" for children was nearing completion.[162]
In September 2012, Rowling stated that she was currently working on two books for readership younger than Harry Potter.[25] She maintained in an interview with The Guardian that one of those two books is the "political fairy tale" she spoke of previously, although she expects to release the other book as her next project.[24] At the Cheltenham Literature Festival on 6 October 2012 she said that she had a couple of things on her laptop aimed at a slightly younger age group than Harry Potter which are "nearly done".[163]
As regards the possibility of an eighth Harry Potter book, she has said, "I can't say I'll never write another book about that world just because I think, what do I know, in ten years' time I might want to return to it but I think it's unlikely."[164] In October 2007 she stated that her future work was unlikely to be in the fantasy genre, explaining, "I think probably I've done my fantasy ... it would be incredibly difficult to go out and create another world that didn't in some way overlap with Harry's or maybe borrow a little too much from Harry."[165] On 1 October 2010, in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Rowling stated a new book on the saga might happen.[166]
In 2007, Rowling stated that she plans to write an encyclopedia of Harry Potter's wizarding world consisting of various unpublished material and notes.[167] Any profits from such a book would be given to charity.[168] During a news conference at Hollywood's Kodak Theatre in 2007, Rowling, when asked how the encyclopedia was coming along, said, "It's not coming along, and I haven't started writing it. I never said it was the next thing I'd do."[169] At the end of 2007, Rowling said that the encyclopaedia could take up to ten years to complete, stating "There is no point in doing it unless it is amazing. The last thing I want to do is to rush something out".[86]
In June 2011, Rowling announced that future Harry Potter projects, and all electronic downloads, would be concentrated in a new website, called Pottermore.[170] The site includes 18,000 words of additional information on characters, places and objects in the Harry Potter universe.[171] On 13 April 2012, following the website's release, Rowling confirmed that she had started work on the encyclopedia and would donate all royalties to charity as she had previously planned.[172] In May 2012, she said, "I have been enjoying sharing information about Harry's world on Pottermore for free, and don't have any firm plans to publish it in book form."[172]
In 2000, Rowling established the Volant Charitable Trust, which uses its annual budget of £5.1 million to combat poverty and social inequality. The fund also gives to organisations that aid children, one parent families, and multiple sclerosis research.[173] Rowling said, "I think you have a moral responsibility when you've been given far more than you need, to do wise things with it and give intelligently."[158]
Rowling, once a single parent herself, is now president of the charity Gingerbread (originally One Parent Families), having already become their first Ambassador in 2000.[174][175] Rowling collaborated with Sarah Brown to write a book of children's stories to aid One Parent Families.[176]
In 2001, the UK anti-poverty fundraiser Comic Relief asked three best-selling British authors – cookery writer and TV presenter Delia Smith, Bridget Jones creator Helen Fielding, and Rowling – to submit booklets related to their most famous works for publication.[177] Rowling's two booklets, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages, are ostensibly facsimiles of books found in the Hogwarts library. Since going on sale in March 2001, the books have raised £15.7 million ($30 million) for the fund. The £10.8 million ($20 million) they have raised outside the UK have been channelled into a newly created International Fund for Children and Young People in Crisis.[178] In 2002 Rowling contributed a foreword to Magic, an anthology of fiction published by Bloomsbury Publishing, helping to raise money for the National Council for One Parent Families.[179]
In 2005, Rowling and MEP Emma Nicholson founded the Children's High Level Group (now Lumos).[180] In January 2006, Rowling went to Bucharest to highlight the use of caged beds in mental institutions for children.[181] To further support the CHLG, Rowling auctioned one of seven handwritten and illustrated copies of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a series of fairy tales referred to in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The book was purchased for £1.95 million by on-line bookseller Amazon.com on 13 December 2007, becoming the most expensive modern book ever sold at auction.[182] Rowling commented, "This will mean so much to children in desperate need of help. It means Christmas has come early to me."[182][183] Rowling gave away the remaining six copies to those who have a close connection with the Harry Potter books.[182] In 2008, Rowling agreed to publish the book with the proceeds going to Lumos.[125] On 1 June 2010 (International Children's Day), Lumos launched an annual initiative – Light a Birthday Candle for Lumos.[184] In November 2013, Rowling handed over all earnings from the sale of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, totaling nearly £19 million.[185]
In July 2012, Rowling was featured at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in London where she read a few lines from J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan as part of a tribute to Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital. An inflatable representation of Lord Voldemort and other children's literary characters accompanied her reading.[186]
Rowling has contributed money and support for research and treatment of multiple sclerosis, from which her mother suffered before her death in 1990. In 2006, Rowling contributed a substantial sum toward the creation of a new Centre for Regenerative Medicine at Edinburgh University, later named the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic.[187] In 2010 she donated a further £10 million to the centre.[188] For reasons unknown, Scotland, Rowling's country of adoption, has the highest rate of multiple sclerosis in the world. In 2003, Rowling took part in a campaign to establish a national standard of care for MS sufferers.[189] In April 2009, she announced that she was withdrawing her support for Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland, citing her inability to resolve an ongoing feud between the organisation's northern and southern branches that had sapped morale and led to several resignations.[189]
In May 2008, bookseller Waterstones asked Rowling and 12 other writers (Sebastian Faulks, Doris Lessing, Lisa Appignanesi, Margaret Atwood, Lauren Child, Richard Ford, Neil Gaiman, Nick Hornby, Michael Rosen, Axel Scheffler, Tom Stoppard and Irvine Welsh) to compose a short piece of their own choosing on a single A5 card, which would then be sold at auction in aid of the charities Dyslexia Action and English PEN. Rowling's contribution was an 800-word Harry Potter prequel that concerns Harry's father, James Potter, and godfather, Sirius Black, and takes place three years before Harry was born. The cards were collected together and sold for charity in book form in August 2008.[190]
On 1 and 2 August 2006, she read alongside Stephen King and John Irving at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Profits from the event were donated to the Haven Foundation, a charity that aids artists and performers left uninsurable and unable to work, and the medical NGO Médecins Sans Frontières.[191] In May 2007, Rowling pledged a donation reported as over £250,000 or over $495,000 to a reward fund started by the tabloid News of the World for the safe return of a young British girl, Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal.[192] Rowling, along with Nelson Mandela, Al Gore, and Alan Greenspan, wrote an introduction to a collection of Gordon Brown's speeches, the proceeds of which are donated to the Jennifer Brown Research Laboratory.[193]
Rowling is a supporter of The Shannon Trust, which runs the Toe by Toe Reading Plan and the Shannon Reading Plan in prisons across Britain, helping and giving tutoring to prisoners who cannot read.[194]
Rowling has named communist and civil rights activist Jessica Mitford as "[her] most influential writer" saying, "Jessica Mitford has been my heroine since I was 14 years old, when I overheard my formidable great-aunt discussing how Mitford had run away at the age of 19 to fight with the Reds in the Spanish Civil War", and claims what inspired her about Mitford was that she was "incurably and instinctively rebellious, brave, adventurous, funny and irreverent, she liked nothing better than a good fight, preferably against a pompous and hypocritical target".[195] Rowling has described Jane Austen as her favourite author,[196] calling Emma her favourite book in O magazine.[197] As a child, Rowling has said her early influences included The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis, The Little White Horse by Elizabeth Goudge, and Manxmouse by Paul Gallico.[198]
In September 2008, on the eve of the Labour Party Conference, Rowling announced that she had donated £1 million to the Labour Party, and publicly endorsed Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown over Tory challenger David Cameron, saying in a statement:
I believe that poor and vulnerable families will fare much better under the Labour Party than they would under a Cameron-led Conservative Party. Gordon Brown has consistently prioritised and introduced measures that will save as many children as possible from a life lacking in opportunity or choice. The Labour government has reversed the long-term trend in child poverty, and is one of the leading EU countries in combating child poverty. David Cameron's promise of tax perks for the married, on the other hand, is reminiscent of the Conservative government I experienced as a lone parent. It sends the message that the Conservatives still believe a childless, dual-income, but married couple is more deserving of a financial pat on the head than those struggling, as I once was, to keep their families afloat in difficult times.[199]
Rowling is a close friend of Sarah Brown, wife of Gordon Brown, whom she met when they collaborated on a charitable project (see above). When Brown's son Fraser was born in 2003, Rowling was one of the first to visit her in the hospital.[200]
Rowling discussed the 2008 United States presidential election with the Spanish-language newspaper El País. She said she was obsessed with the United States elections because they would have a profound effect on the rest of the world. In February 2008, she said that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton would be "extraordinary" in the White House. In the same interview, she also said her hero was Robert F. Kennedy.[201]
In April 2010, Rowling published an article in The Times in which she heavily criticised Cameron's plan to encourage married couples to stay together by offering them a £150 annual tax credit.
Nobody who has ever experienced the reality of poverty could say "it's not the money, it's the message". When your flat has been broken into, and you cannot afford a locksmith, it is the money. When you are two pence short of a tin of baked beans, and your child is hungry, it is the money. When you find yourself contemplating shoplifting to get nappies, it is the money. If Mr Cameron's only practical advice to women living in poverty, the sole carers of their children, is "get married, and we'll give you £150", he reveals himself to be completely ignorant of their true situation. How many prospective husbands did I ever meet, when I was the single mother of a baby, unable to work, stuck inside my flat, night after night, with barely enough money for life's necessities? Should I have proposed to the youth who broke in through my kitchen window at 3 am? Half a billion pounds, to send a message – would it not be more cost-effective, more personal, to send all the lower-income married people flowers?[202]
As a resident of Scotland, Rowling is eligible to vote in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, and intends to vote in favour of the union.[24]
Over the years, some religious people have decried Rowling's books for supposedly promoting witchcraft. Rowling identifies as a Christian. She attended a Church of Scotland congregation while writing Harry Potter and her eldest daughter, Jessica, was baptised there.[203] "I go to church myself", she says, "I don't take any responsibility for the lunatic fringes of my own religion."[204] She once said, "I believe in God, not magic."[205] Early on she felt that if readers knew of her Christian beliefs they would be able to "guess what is coming in the books".[206]
In 2007, Rowling described her religious background in an interview with the Dutch newspaper the Volkskrant:[207]
I was officially raised in the Church of England, but I was actually more of a freak in my family. We didn't talk about religion in our home. My father didn't believe in anything, neither did my sister. My mother would incidentally visit the church, but mostly during Christmas. And I was immensely curious. From when I was 13, 14 I went to church alone. I found it very interesting what was being said there, and I believed in it. When I went to university, I became more critical. I got more annoyed with the smugness of religious people and I went to church less and less. Now I'm at the point where I started: yes, I believe. And yes, I go to the church. A Protestant church here in Edinburgh. My husband is also raised Protestant, but he comes from a very strict Scottish group. One where they couldn't sing and talk.
Rowling has occasionally expressed ambivalence about her religious faith. In a 2006 interview with Tatler magazine, Rowling noted that, "like Graham Greene, my faith is sometimes about if my faith will return. It's important to me."[22] In a British documentary, JK Rowling: A Year in the Life, when asked if she believed in God, she said, "Yes. I do struggle with it; I couldn't pretend that I'm not doubt-ridden about a lot of things and that would be one of them but I would say yes." When asked if she believed in an afterlife, she said, "Yes; I think I do."[208] She further said, "It's something that I wrestle with a lot. It preoccupies me a lot, and I think that's very obvious within the books."[209] In a 2008 interview with the Spanish newspaper El País, Rowling said, "I feel very drawn to religion, but at the same time I feel a lot of uncertainty. I live in a state of spiritual flux. I believe in the permanence of the soul."[210] In an interview with the Today Show in July 2007, she said, "...until we reached Book Seven, views of what happens after death and so on... would give away a lot of what was coming. So... yes, my belief and my struggling with religious belief and so on I think is quite apparent in this book."[211] In a 2012 radio interview with Mark Lawson she said she was a member of the Scottish Episcopal Church, a province of the Anglican Communion.[212]
Rowling, her publishers, and Time Warner, the owner of the rights to the Harry Potter films, have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyright. The worldwide popularity of the Harry Potter series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other derivative works, sparking efforts to ban or contain them.[213]
Another area of legal dispute involves a series of injunctions obtained by Rowling and her publishers to prohibit anyone from reading her books before their official release date.[214] The injunction drew fire from civil liberties and free speech campaigners and sparked debates over the "right to read".[215][216]
Rowling has had a difficult relationship with the press. She admits to being "thin-skinned" and dislikes the fickle nature of reporting. "They went in one day from saying, 'She's got writer's block' to saying, 'She's been self-indulgent'", she told The Times in 2003, "And I thought, well, what a difference 24 hours makes." Rowling nonetheless disputes her reputation as a recluse who hates to be interviewed.[217]
As of 2011, Rowling has taken more than 50 actions against the press.[218] In 2001, the Press Complaints Commission upheld a complaint by Rowling over a series of unauthorised photographs of her with her daughter on the beach in Mauritius published in OK! Magazine.[219] In 2007, Rowling's young son, David, assisted by Rowling and her husband, lost a court fight to ban publication of a photograph of him. The photo, taken by a photographer using a long-range lens, was subsequently published in a Sunday Express article featuring Rowling's family life and motherhood.[21] The judgment was overturned in David's favour in May 2008.[220]
Rowling has said she particularly dislikes the British tabloid the Daily Mail, which made references to a stalker Rowling insists does not exist, and conducted interviews with her estranged ex-husband. As one journalist noted, "Harry's Uncle Vernon is a grotesque philistine of violent tendencies and remarkably little brain. It is not difficult to guess which newspaper Rowling gives him to read [in Goblet of Fire]."[221] As of January 2014, she is seeking damages from the Daily Mail for libel over an article about her time as a single mother.[222]
Some have speculated that Rowling's fraught relationship with the press was the inspiration behind the character Rita Skeeter, a gossipy celebrity journalist who first appears in Goblet of Fire, but Rowling noted in 2000 that the character actually predates her rise to fame: "People have asked me whether Rita Skeeter was invented [to reflect Harry Potter's popularity], but in fact she was always planned."[223] "I tried to put Rita in Philosopher's Stone – you know when Harry walks into the Leaky Cauldron for the first time and everyone says, "Mr. Potter you're back!", I wanted to put a journalist in there. She wasn't called Rita then but she was a woman. And then I thought, as I looked at the plot overall, I thought, that's not really where she fits best, she fits best in Four when Harry's supposed to come to terms with his fame."[224]
In September 2011, Rowling was named a "core participant" in the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the British press, as one of dozens of celebrities who may have been the victim of phone hacking.[225] On 24 November 2011, Rowling gave evidence before the inquiry; although she was not suspected to have been the victim of phone hacking (she "hardly used her phone in the 90s", she said),[226] her testimony included accounts of photographers camping on her doorstep, her fiance being duped into giving his home address to a journalist masquerading as a tax official,[226] her chasing a paparazzo a week after giving birth,[218] a journalist leaving a note inside her then-five-year-old daughter's schoolbag, and an attempt by the Sun to "blackmail" her into a photo opportunity in exchange for the return of a stolen manuscript.[227] Rowling claimed she had to leave her former home in Merchiston, Edinburgh because of press intrusion.[227] In November 2012, Rowling wrote an article for The Guardian in reaction to David Cameron's decision to not implement the full recommendations of the Leveson inquiry, saying she felt "duped and angry".[228]
In 2014, Rowling reaffirmed her support for "Hacked Off" and its campaign towards press self-regulation by co-signing with a number of other British celebrities a declaration to "[safeguard] the press from political interference while also giving vital protection to the vulnerable."[229]
Rowling has received honorary degrees from St Andrews University, the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh Napier University, the University of Exeter,[230] the University of Aberdeen[231][232] and Harvard University, for whom she spoke at the 2008 commencement ceremony.[233] In 2009 Rowling was awarded the Légion d'honneur by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.[29]

British writer Joanne Kathleen Rowling, born July 31, 1965, is the  creator of the wildly successful Harry Potter book series. Rowling  attended (1976–1982) Wyedean Comprehensive School in Chepstow, England.  She studied French at the University of Exeter (B.A., 1987) and, after  studying in Paris, went on to work for Amnesty International in London.  Rowling reported that she was on a train when she began to imagine the  first book of the series. She later said, "Harry just strolled into my  head fully formed." In 1991, Rowling moved to Oporto, Portugal, where she taught English  as a second language. She married a Portuguese journalist, with whom she  had a daughter. She then moved to Scotland in 1994 and finished her  first Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,  in 1995. The book was published by Bloomsbury Children's Books in 1997  and in the United States by Arthur A. Levine/Scholastic Press in 1998 (where it was renamed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone). Rowling went on to write six more Harry Potter books. All in the  series were illustrated by Mary GrandPré. Film versions were made for  all of them (8 movies, with the final book split into two films). The  Harry Potter books proved to be a worldwide publishing phenomenon; new  editions were greeted by millions of fans, some of whom waited in  costume for a midnight release. Rowling also wrote Quidditch through the Ages and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (both 2001). In 2007, Rowling produced seven individual copies of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a volume of five fairy tales left to the character of Hermione Granger by Albus Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  (2007). One of the seven copies was auctioned at Sotheby's in London.  It sold for £1.95 million (about $4 million); all proceeds went to The Children's Voice campaign, a charity Rowling co-founded to help improve the lives of institutionalized children across Europe. The book went on sale to the general public in December 2008. In 2011, Rowling announced a new Harry Potter website called Pottermore, which features new and previously unpublished material about the world of Harry Potter. The Casual Vacancy (2012) is a novel aimed at adult readers.
On February 3, 2000, classrooms across America went online to ask J.K. Rowling their burning questions about Harry Potter. Below...

=======================================================
J. K. (Jo) Rowling was born in 1965 and moved house twice when she was growing up. The first move was from Yate (just outside Bristol) to Winterbourne. The second move was when Jo was nine and she moved to Tutshill near Chepstow in the Forest of Dean.
Jo went to Tutshill Primary School, and then on to Wyedean Comprehensive. She was quiet, freckly, short-sighted and not very good at sports. She even broke her arm playing netball. Her favourite subject by far was English, but she also liked languages . . .
Jo always loved writing more than anything. ‘The first story that I ever wrote down, when I was five or six, was about a rabbit called Rabbit. He got the measles and was visited by his friends, including a giant bee called Miss Bee. And ever since Rabbit and Miss Bee, I have wanted to be a writer, though I rarely told anyone so. I was afraid they’d tell me I didn’t have a hope.’ At school she would entertain her friends at lunchtime with stories.
After school, Jo attended the University of Exeter in Devon where she studied French. Her parents hoped that by studying languages she would enjoy a great career as a bilingual secretary. But Jo recalls that she never paid much attention in meetings because she was too busy scribbling down ideas.
When she was 25, Jo was delayed on a train from Manchester to London. On the train Jo says that the idea for Harry Potter simply ‘strolled into her head fully formed’. But she didn’t have a pen so couldn’t write all her thoughts down! But the idea had taken hold and during the next five years she started writing and outlining the plots for each book. 
Jo went to Portugal to teach English. There she married and her daughter Jessica was born. And she kept writing. When she returned to the UK, Jo had a suitcase full of stories about Harry Potter. She moved to Edinburgh with her young daughter and worked as a French teacher. In 1996 Bloomsbury offered to publish Jo’s first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.
Jo married Dr Neil Murray in 2001, and a brother for Jessica, David, was born in 2003. A sister, Mackenzie, followed in January 2005. She lives with her family in Edinburgh.
The Harry Potter novels have now sold approximately 450 million copies worldwide and been translated into 72 languages. Jo was the first children’s author to be voted the BA Author of the Year, and also to win the British Book Awards Author of the Year.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Joanne Rowling was born in Yate, near Bristol, a few miles south of a town called Dursley ("Harry Potter"'s Muggle-family). Her father Peter Rowling was an engineer for Rolls Royce in Bristol at this time. Her mother, Anne, was half-French and half-Scottish. They met on a train as it left King's Cross Station in London. Her sister Diana is about 2 years younger than Joanne. In 1971, Peter Rowling moved his family to the nearby village of Winterbourne (still in the Bristol vicinity). During the family's residence in Winterbourne, Jo and Di Rowling were friends with neighborhood children, Ian and Vikki Potter. In 1974, the Rowling family moved yet again, this time to Tutshill, near the Welsh border-town of Chepstow in the Forest of Dean and across the Severn River from the greater Bristol area. Rowling admits to having been a bit of a daydreamer as a child and began writing stories at the age of six. After leaving Exeter University, where she read French and Classics, she started work as a teacher but daydreamed about becoming a writer. One day, stuck on a delayed train for four hours between Manchester and London, she dreamed up a boy called "Harry Potter". That was in 1990. It took her six years to write the book. In the meantime, she went to teach in Portugal, married a Portuguese television journalist, had her daughter, Jessica, divorced her husband and returned to Britain when Jessica was just three months old. She went to live in Edinburgh to be near her sister, Di. Her sudden penury made her realize that it was "back-against-the-wall time" and she decided to finish her "Harry Potter" book. She sent the manuscript to two agents and one publisher, looking up likely prospects in the library. One of these agents that she picked at random based on the fact that she liked his name, Christopher Little, was immediately captivated by the manuscript and signed her on as his client within three days. During the 1995-1996 time-frame, while hoping to get the manuscript for "Harry Potter & The Philosopher's Stone" published, Rowling worked as a French teacher in Edinburgh. Several publishers turned down the manuscript before Bloomsbury agreed to purchase it in 1996.
      Her book, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire", was the top-selling book of 2000, with 7 million hardcovers sold.
      When the first "Harry Potter" novel was published, the publisher asked her to use initials rather than her first name, because boys would be biased against a book written by a woman. Since she only had one given name, they then asked her to make up another initial; she took "K." from her favorite grandmother, Kathleen.
      She was awarded the O.B.E. (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2000 Queen Elizabeth II's Birthday Honors List for her services to literature and received it from one of her fans, Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales.
      In 2002, she was sued for plagiarism in the District Court of the Southern District of New York by Pennsylvania-based author Nancy Stouffer, who claimed that J.K. Rowling had lifted ideas from her 1984 book "The Legend of Rah and Muggles", which includes a character called "Larry Potter". However, the case against J.K. Rowling was dismissed on 19 September 2002, when the judged ruled that Ms. Stouffer had lied to the court and doctored evidence to support her claims.
      Is one of only two contemporary authors to have a novel spend more than a year on both the New York Times hardcover and paperback best-seller lists, the other author being Nicholas Sparks.
      As of November 2002, the year and month of the second "Harry Potter" movie (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)) being released, her franchise of books have currently sold over 175,000,000 copies and printed in over 200 languages to become the biggest and fastest selling novels ever.
      On 3 April 2003, she and Time Warner successfully sued Dutch publishing company Byblos in the Amsterdam High Court. This prevented Byblos from publishing Russian author Dmitry Yemets' novel "The Magic Double Bass", which features girl wizard "Tanya Grotter". It was deemed to plagiarize Rowling's novel "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" and to infringe upon her copyright.
      The fifth book in the Harry Potter series, entitled "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", was published on June 21 2003. It was approximately 896 pages long, containing 38 chapters and over 255,000 words, making it her longest "Harry Potter" book yet. The first U.S. printing was 8.5 million copies, an American publishing record.
      In 2003 unauthorized Chinese-language "sequels" to the "Harry Potter" series appeared for sale in the People's Republic of China. These poorly-written books, by Chinese ghost writers, contain characters from the works of other authors, including Gandalf from J.R.R. Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" and the title character from L. Frank Baum's "The Wizard of Oz". Rowling's lawyers successfully took legal action against the publishers, who were forced to pay damages.
      She is a big fan of the rock band The Smiths and in 2003, she appeared on the Channel Four documentary The Importance of Being Morrissey (2002).
      Is a huge fan of "Monty Python" and claims to put some of their humor into her books. Two apparent references to the "Monty Python" sketch "Crunchy Frog" can be found in her "Harry Potter" books: two of the sweets are a chocolate frog, and a cockroach cluster. "Monty Python" member John Cleese appears in the films.
      One of her favorite movies is The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989), which was written and directed by "Harry Potter" screenwriter Steve Kloves.
      On July 7, 2004, she received an honorary degree from Edinburgh University, in recognition of the Potter books and her outstanding contribution to children's literature.
      Character names in her books are often clues to their identities or secrets. For example, Professor Remus Lupin is a werewolf. According to myth, Romulus and Remus were the founders of Rome and were raised by wolves. His last name, Lupin, is derived from the Latin lupus, for wolf, and the English adjective lupine, meaning wolf-like. Lupin was converted into a werewolf by Fenrir Greyback, whose name is taken from Fenrir, the monstrous wolf son of Loki in Norse mythology. (His alias, Fenrisulfr, was the basis for Fenris Ulf, the American name for Maugrim in C.S. Lewis's "Chronciles of Narnia".) Sirius Black, who turns into a black dog, is named for the star Sirius, which can be found in the constellation Canis Major - the big dog.
      Whilst at University she had little money so, for friends' birthdays, she wrote them personal little stories.
      After spending six years writing the first installment of her "Harry Potter" novels, Rowling was rejected by 9 publishers before London's Bloomsbury Publishing signed her on.
      The day she signed her contract for the first "Harry Potter" novel, the publishing representative told her she would not make any money selling children's books.
      Originally wrote "Harry Potter" to pay off her gas bills while living in a tiny flat with her baby daughter.
      Although she incorporates characteristics of people she knows into "Harry Potter" characters, she says that the character "Gilderoy Lockhart" is the only character she purposely based on someone she knew. She would not say who she based the character on, only that it was not her ex-husband, and that whoever it was is probably so ignorant and so narcissistic, that he is probably claiming either to be the basis for "Albus Dumbledore", or the real author of the "Harry Potter" books.
      Claims her first audience for "Harry Potter" was her daughter, to whom she would read parts of the story that she wrote as a bedtime story.
      Owns two properties in the Perthshire and Edinburgh areas of Scotland. In 2003, she hired a former SAS officer as her bodyguard to patrol her Perth home and protect her family.
      Was almost barred from boarding a plane from the U.S. to the U.K. when airport security personnel demanded that her manuscript for her final book be screened or placed in her checked luggage. Rowling refused to give up the manuscript, which was bound with rubber bands.
      December 21, 2006: Announced that the last "Harry Potter" book will be titled "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows".
      Finished writing the final book in the fantasy franchise three weeks ago - and marked the occasion by leaving graffiti in a Scottish hotel. Eagle-eyed guests at the five-star Balmoral Hotel spotted a line from the best-selling author scrawled in black pen on the back of a marble bust in a room Rowling occupied. She wrote, "J.K. Rowling finished writing Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows in this room (652) on Jan 11th 2007."
      Was #2 on the 'Celebrity Forbes List: Who Made Bank?' of 2006, making her the second richest woman behind Oprah Winfrey.
      In the special double issue of Time magazine (Dec. 31, 2007), she was a runner-up at #3 as "Person of the Year" after political leaders Vladimir Putin #1 and Al Gore #2.
      To date (Summer 2011), she is the best-selling author in the history of literature. She is the first author to become a billionaire from writing books.
      It should not be surprising that Stephen King is one of her biggest fans. Not only are they both best-selling authors of supernatural stories, they were also both schoolteachers before becoming successful writers.
      Her Harry Potter books have appealed to both children and adults. To help attract both audiences, her British hardcover publisher actually releases each of the books with two different dust jackets. One features a realistic picture or photograph of an element of the story, designed to appeal to adults. The other features a comic-book like illustration of a scene from the story, designed to appeal to children.
      (November 11, 2010) During the course of a brief interview in London's West End just prior to the premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010), she revealed that, of all the film adaptations of her books, this was her all-time and personal favorite.
      Director David Yates and writer Steve Kloves have both worked on adaptations of her Harry Potter books; working together on Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009), Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010), and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011). Their collaboration has been so fruitful that their next project together is The Stand. This will be based on the novel by Stephen King, who is one of Rowling's biggest American fans.
      With earnings of £560m, Rowling ranked #148 of the 1,000 richest people in the UK's The Sunday Times "Rich List" annual magazine supplement (2012).
      Mother Anne died of multiple sclerosis before ever having had the opportunity to enjoy the monumental success of daughter Joanne's Harry Potter books and movies. In honor of her memory and the circumstances of her death, Joanne contributed £10m to the "Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic" at Edinburgh University, Scotland.
      Severus Snape is believed to have been based on John Lawrence Nettleship, a Chemistry teacher at Wyedean School in Gloucestershire. Rowling and her mother were both students of his.
      Gave birth to her 1st child at age 27, a daughter Jessica Isabel Rowling-Arantes on July 27, 1993. Child's father is her 1st husband, Jorge Arantes.
      Gave birth to her 2nd child at age 37, a son David Gordon Rowling-Murray on March 24, 2003. Child's father is her 2nd husband, Neil Murray.
      Gave birth to her 3rd child at age 39, a daughter Mackenzie Jean Rowling-Murray on January 23, 2005. Child's father is her 2nd husband, Neil Murray.
      She secretly published a crime novel, "The Cuckoo's Calling", under the pseudonym of "first-time author" Robert Galbraith, so it would be given unbiased reviews that were independent of her reputation as author of the Harry Potter books and "The Casual Vacancy".
      Wrote and released "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince", the sixth installment of the Harry Potter series. [July 2005]
      Currently putting the finishing touches on "Harry Potter and the Half- Blood Prince", the sixth book in the series. It will get a worldwide release at midnight on July 16th, 2005. [July 2004]
      Currently at work on the final installment of the "Harry Potter" series. It should be released sometime in 2007. [November 2005]
      Preparing for the release of her latest and last book in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows [May 2007]
      Was inspired to create the character of Hagrid after overhearing a muscular biker worry that the petunias he cared for weren't doing very well.
      Based the character of Gilderoy Lockhart on someone she knew and admits that she actually had to tone down his personality to make it more believable.
      [Asked by an interviewer about the next "Harry Potter" book]: Well, it will be a papery object with pages inside.
      [Discussing her daughter, Jessica]: Kids at her school will sidle up to me and say, "Does Jessica know what happens in book 4? Does Jessica know the title of book 4?" And I keep saying, "No! There is no point kidnapping her, taking her around back of the bike shed, and torturing her for information."
      I had an American journalist say to me, "Is it true you wrote the whole of the first novel on napkins?" I was tempted to say, "On teabags, I used to save them."
      The spells are made up. I have met people who assure me, very seriously, that they are trying to do them, and I can assure them, just as seriously, that they don't work.
      [When asked what the title would be for book six]: It will be called 'Harry Potter and...' something. Catchy, don't you think? And I think I'll follow the same model for seven.
      People ask me if there are going to be stories of Harry Potter as an adult. Frankly, if I wanted to, I could keep writing stories until Harry is a senior citizen, but I don't know how many people would actually want to read about a 65 year old Harry still at Hogwarts playing bingo with Ron and Hermione.
      [About being held up at an airport for refusing to be parted from the manuscript of her seventh "Harry Potter" book]: The heightened security restrictions on the airlines made the journey back from New York interesting, as I refused to be parted from the manuscript of book seven. A large part of it is handwritten and there was no copy of anything I had done while in the U.S. They let me take it on thankfully, bound up in elastic bands. I don't know what I would have done if they hadn't -- sailed home probably.
      Why do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me. I was set free, because my greatest fear had been realized, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so Rock bottom became a solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you've lived so cautiously, that you might as well not have lived at all.
      [At the premiere at the last Harry Potter movie (2011)] Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home.
=======================================================
One of the most popular writers of our time, bestselling author JK Rowling is credited with doing perhaps more than any other contemporary writer to get Britain’s schoolchildren reading again with her Harry Potter books. Appropriately enough, her own “rags to riches” life story reads like a magical tale out of one of her own novels.
Joanne Kathleen Rowling was born on 31 July 1965, in the quaint village of Chipping Sodbury, in Gloucestershire, England. Her father was Peter James Rowling, and her mother, Anne. Two years after Rowling was born, her mother gave birth to a sister, called Diana. Rowling (who likes to be called by her nickname, Jo) has said that one of the reasons she first began making up stories was in order to keep her younger sibling entertained.Rowling attended school at nearby St. Michael's village school, and has often claimed that her first headmaster, an elderly teacher called Alfred Dunn, was the inspiration for the character of Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter's head teacher at Hogwarts. Rowling was composing her first fantasy stories in her spare time, including one of her earliest tales, about a rabbit called Rabbit. Rowling's sister recalls that he was unlucky enough to catch the measles, and was visited by his friends, including a giant bee called Miss Bee. When she was nine-years-old, the family moved to the village of Tutshill, near Chepstow, where she went on to attend secondary school at Wyedean College.In interviews, Rowling has described herself as being "shy and freckly, with no sports ability, but a great love of literature." When asked about her teenage years, she said, "The character of Hermione is loosely based on me, which I'm not particularly proud of." During the same period, an elderly aunt gave her a copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, 'Hons and Rebels'; Mitford subsequently became one of her favourite authors. Quiet and studious, she did well at school, and went on to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in French and Classics at the University of Exeter. Her student days were happy ones by all accounts, for she recalls her delight at meeting "like-minded people", and she was also lucky enough to spend a year studying in Paris.After graduating, Rowling moved to London, where she initially began training to become a bilingual secretary. However, she abandoned this idea after a while, since she soon discovered that she was "the worst secretary ever, very disorganised!". In addition, her attention would wander during meetings, as ideas for stories would come to her while she was meant to be taking dictation. But her daydreaming was to prove far more rewarding in the long run, for in early 1990, during the course of a long train journey from Manchester to London, she first had the idea for a story about a young boy who goes to study at a school for wizards.Shortly afterwards, she decided to retrain as an English teacher, and moved to Portugal, where she met and married a native journalist, called Jorge Arantes, in 1992. She gave birth to their daughter, Jessica Isabel, on 27 July the following year. Sadly, the marriage was short-lived, and the couple separated only four short months later. A year later, Rowling moved back to Britain, and went to live in Edinburgh, Scotland, so that she could be near her sister. Life as a single mother living on social security in the bleak Scottish winter was dismal, and she was subsequently diagnosed with clinical depression; she is on record as saying that at one point during this ultra-low period of her life, she even contemplated committing suicide.However, like all true writers, she channelled her worst experiences to creative ends, and used her experience of depression as the basis for the happiness-sucking wraiths in the Harry Potter books, the Dementors. Her daily routine included lots of long walks in order to get her baby daughter to fall asleep, and she would often end up in Nicholson's Café. It was here in this Edinburgh café that she first began to set down on paper her ideas - and the rest, as they say, is history…Creating the character of Harry Potter did not bring overnight fame and fortune for the struggling single mum; and there were to be many twists and turns along the way before Rowling's quality as an author were fully recognised. In 1995, she finished typing out 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' on an old manual typewriter, and sent it out to various literary agents. A reader called Bryony Evans, at Christopher Little literary agents, was quick to recognise the potential of her work, and the firm promptly agreed to represent her, sending the book out to no less than twelve publishers.It was to be a full year before she received the exciting news that her book had found a publisher: the lucky firm was the small publishing house of Bloomsbury. Publishing legend has it that the decision to publish the book owes much to Alice Newton, the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chairman. Rowling was paid an advance of £1,500 for her first novel, which was published in June 1997, with an initial print run of one thousand copies, 500 of which were sold to libraries. Incidentally, these first Harry Potter books are now regarded as collector's items, and are estimated to be worth up to £25,000 apiece.As her books gained more exposure, Rowling's talent and ability as a children's writer was soon recognised. One of the first awards she won was the much-coveted Nestle Smarties award – indeed, she went on to win the award three consecutive times, before thoughtfully withdrawing her fourth book from the running in order to give other writers a fighting chance. A grant of £8,000 from the Scottish Arts Council enabled her to carry on writing full-time – but within a relatively short time, she had sold enough books to guarantee her financial security. But she could hardly have envisaged the success and fortune that was waiting just around the corner.In 1998, one short year after her first book had seen print, she sold the film rights for her first two books to Warner Brothers, for an undisclosed seven-figure sum, making her a millionaire overnight. When her fourth book, 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' was published, the book broke all previous publishing records, selling over 372,000 copies in the UK on the first day, and over three million copies in the United States within the first 48 hours. Unsurprisingly, Rowling was named Author of The Year at the British Book Awards in 2000.Life was going well for Rowling on the personal front too: in December 2001, she married Neil Michael Murray, an anaesthetist, in a private ceremony at her home in Aberfeldy, Scotland. Rowling and Murray's son, David Gordon Rowling Murray, was born in March 2003, and she went on to give birth to a daughter, Mackenzie Jean, in January 2005. These happy developments in her private life meant that her output slowed down, and the tabloid press speculated that she was suffering from writer's block.Rowling's heated response underlined the uneasy nature of her relationship with the press, which some critics suggested led to the creation of the character of Rita Skeeter, the muckraking journalist in the Harry Potter books. The press have depicted Rowling as a recluse who hates to be interviewed – an image that she outspokenly disagrees with. She even went to court to defend her baby son's privacy, when a photographer took some long-range pictures of him in his buggy.More recently, she took part in a BBC documentary, 'A Year In the Life', which showed her reduced to tears when she revisited the tiny Edinburgh flat where she completed the first Harry Potter book, saying "this is where I turned my life around."
Rowling's books have made her a multi-millionaire, and the 2008 Sunday Times Rich List named her the 144th richest person in Britain. To her credit, she has used her considerable wealth and power to establish herself as a notable philanthropist.In 2000, she founded the Volant Charitable Trust, which sets aside £5.1 million annually to help women and children in need, especially focusing on organisations that help one parent families. She is also president of the charity One Parent Families, and was their first Ambassador in 2000.Having completed the final installment in the seven-book Harry Potter series, which was published in July 2007, Rowling has said that she is not planning to write an eighth book, saying "In ten years time, I might want to return to it, but I think it's unlikely." She also said that she wants to spend a lot of time with her family, but would continue writing for children – "because that's what I enjoy!" 'The Tales of Beedle The Bard' was published in December 2008 to raise money for the Children's High Level Group, now called Lumos.Since then she has turned her attention to adult literature. On 12 April 2012, she revealed the title of her new book 'A Casual Vacancy'. It tells the story of a village at war, with the publication announcement stating: "Rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils ... Pagford is not what it first seems." It will be published by Little Brown on 27 September 2012.Rowling hasn't forgotten about her boy wizard Harry Potter as she was instrumental in setting up 'Pottermore' with Sony. This website opens up the world of Harry Potter to its fans as they can explore the places depicted in the books, find out which house they belong to and find out more about characters. She has also teamed up with Sony to create a Harry Potter-based augmented reality game called 'Book of Spells' for the firm's new Wonderbook, which will be released in Christmas 2012.She now lives with her husband and three children in Edinburgh where she intends to build two large interlocked tree houses for her offspring to play in.
=======================================================
J.K  Rowling was born in Chipping Sodury, July 31st 1965. Her childhood  was generally happy, although she does remember getting teased because of her  name, “Rowling” – She recalls often getting called “Rowling pin” by her less  than ingenious school friends. J.K. Rowling says she never really warmed to her  own name, although, she does remember having a fondness for the name Potter from  quite an early age. J.K.Rowling studied at St Michael's Primary School in Gloucestershire, before  moving to Chepstow, South Wales at the age of nine. 
From  an early age, J.K. Rowling had an ambition to be a writer. She often tried her  hand at writing, although little came from her early efforts. Aged six she wrote a book about a rabbit with measles. After her mother praised her effort. Rowling replied 'well get it published then.' She admits it was a 'Bit of an odd thing for a child of six to think. I don’t know where it came from…”
In her own  autobiography she remembers with great fondness, when her good friend Sean  became the first person to give her the confidence that one day she would be  able to make a very good writer.
“he was  also the only person who thought I was bound to be a success at it, which meant  much more to me than I ever told him at the time” (1)
Sean was  also the owner of a battered old Ford Anglia, which would later appear in one  of the Harry Potter series as a flying car. 
After finishing school, her parents encouraged her to study  French at the University of Exeter. She slightly regretted choosing French,  saying she would have preferred to study English. However, it was her parents  wish that she study something “ more useful” than English. 
After  having spent a year in Paris, J.K.Rowling graduated from university and  took various jobs in London. One of her favourite jobs was working for Amnesty  International; the charity, which campaigns against human rights abuses  throughout the world. Amnesty International, is one of the many charities, which  J.K.Rowling has generously supported since she attained a new found wealth.
It was in 1990, that J.K.Rowling first conceived of the idea  about Harry Potter. As she recalls, it was on a long train journey from Manchester to London when she began forming in her mind, the characters of the series.  At the forefront, was a young boy, at that time not aware that he was a wizard. The train was  delayed for over four hours, but she didn’t have a pen and was too shy to ask for  one nothing,
 "To my immense frustration, I didn't have a pen that worked, and I was too shy to ask anybody if I could borrow one."
  But she remembers being very enthusiastic, and  excited about the ideas which were filling her mind.
On arriving at her flat in Clapham Junction, she began work on writing the book  immediately, although, it would take several years to come to fruition.
 It was  also in December of 1990 that J.K.Rowling lost her mother, who died of Multiple  Sclerosis. J.K.Rowling was very close to her mother, and she felt the loss  deeply. Her own loss gave an added poignancy to the death of Harry Potter’s  mother in her book. She says her  favourite scene in the Philosopher’s Stone is, The Mirror of Erised, where Harry sees his parents in the  mirror.
In 1991, J.K.Rowling left England to get a job as an English  teacher in Portugal. It was here that she met her first husband, Jorge Arantes - and together  they had a child Jessica. However, after a couple of years, the couple split  after a fierce argument; where by all accounts J.K.Rowling was thrown out of  the house.
In Dec 1993, Rowling returned to the UK, moving to Edinburgh where she tried to finish her first  book. She was surviving on state benefits and bringing up her daughter as a single  parent. She would often go to Edinburgh cafes to work on the book whilst her child had a nap.
Eventually, she finished her first copy of the Philosopher's Stone', and sent it off to various  agents. She found an agent, Christopher, who spent over a year trying to get a  publisher. It was rejected by 12 major publishing houses. But, eventually, a quite small publisher, Bloomsbury agreed to take the  book on. The editor Barry Cunningham also agreed to pay her an advance of  £1500. The decision to take on the book was, in large part, due to his eight year old  daughters enthusiastic reception of the first chapter (However she was advised  to continue her training as a teacher because she was told writers of children’s books don’t tend to get very well  paid.)
Within a few weeks of publication, (1996)  book sales  really started to take off. The initial print run was of only 1,000 – 500 of  which went to libraries. First editions are now said to be worth up to £25,000  each. She also received a grant from the Scottish arts council, which enabled  her to write full time. After the books initial success in the UK, an American  company Scholastic agreed to pay a remarkable £100,000 for the rights to  publish in America. In 1998, Warner Bros secured the film rights for the books,  giving a seven figure sum. The films have magnified the success of the books, making  Harry Potter into one of the most recognisable media products. Under the close  guidance of J.K.Rowling, the films have sought to stay close to the original  plot; also at J.K.Rowling’s request all the actors are British and are filmed in Britain.
On the 21st December  2006, J.K.Rowling finished her final book of the Harry Potter Series – "Harry Potter and the  Deathly Hallows". The book was released in July 2007, becoming one of the fastest selling books of all time. J.K.Rowling has said  the book is her favourite, and it makes her both happy and sad. She has said she  will continue writing but there is little chance of continuing the Harry Potter  Series. She however, may release a dictionary of things related to Hogwarts and  Harry Potter, that were never published in other books.
Since the end of her Harry Potter series, she says she has finished some short stories, she also hinted on the Oprah Winfrey Show in 1st October, 2010, that an 8th book in the Harry Potter series is a possibility.
On 27 September 2012, Rowling released the 'Casual Vacancy' an adult novel. In 2013, The Cuckoo's Calling was published. Initially, the author was stated as being Robert Galbraith. But, this was a pseudonym used by J.K.Rowling. After her authorship was discovered, sales went through the roof.
J.K.Rowling has sought to protect her children from media intrusion. In 2011, she gave testimony to the Leverson enquiry about how unscrupulous reporters sought to intrude into her family's privacy. After her books became best-sellers, reporters would often be camped outside her home. J.K. Rowling said:
              neighbours and sitting in parked cars immediately outside the gate. Old friendships were tested as journalists turned up on their doorsteps, and
"It's very difficult to say how angry I felt that my 5-year-old  daughter's school was no longer a place of complete security from  journalists."
J.K.Rowling currently lives in Scotland, on the banks of the  river Tay, with her 2nd husband Neil Murray; J.K.Rowling has 3  children, two with husband Neil.
In 2011, her estimated wealth stands at £530 million, according to Sunday Times Rich List. The global Harry Potter brand is estimated to be worth £7 billion.
Multiple sclerosis. She has contributed money to the research and treatment of Multiple Sclerosis, which her mother suffered from.
She has publically supported the Labour party. In 2008, she donated £1 million to the Labour party, saying she felt vulnerable families would be better off under a Labour government. She describes her political hero as Robert F.Kennedy.
J.K.Rowling states that she considers herself a Christian, and attends a local Church of Scotland congregation. She said, that unlike other members in her family, she often had a deep interest in religion, and would go to churches alone. However, she also says that although she believes in God, at times she doubts her faith.
 "I feel very drawn to religion, but at the same time I feel a lot of  uncertainty. I live in a state of spiritual flux. I believe in the  permanence of the soul."

Author J.K. Rowling participates in a news conference for 'An Evening With Harry, Carrie and Garp,' a reading with Rowling, Stephen King, and John Irving, at Radio City Music Hall August 1, 2006 in New York City.
J.K. Rowling was born at Yate General Hospital as Joanne Rowling (with no middle name) on July 31, 1965 in Gloucestershire, England. (Although Chipping Sodbury is often mentioned as her birthplace, her birth certificate says Yate.) Rowling's parents, Peter James Rowling and Anne Volant, met on a train on their way to join the British navy (the navy for Peter and the Women's Royal Naval Service for Anne). They married a year later, at age 19. At age 20, the young couple became new parents when Joanne Rowling arrived, followed by Joanne's sister, Diane "Di," 23 months later.
When Rowling was young, the family moved twice. At age four, Rowling and her family moved to Winterbourne. It was here that she met a brother and sister who lived in her neighborhood with the last name Potter. At age nine Rowling moved to Tutshill. The timing of the second move was clouded by the death of Rowling's favorite grandmother, Kathleen. Later, when Rowling was asked to use initials as a pseudonym for the Harry Potter books to attract more boy readers, Rowling chose "K" for Kathleen as her second initial to honor her grandmother.
At age 11, Rowling began attending the Wyedean School where she worked hard for her grades and was terrible at sports. Rowling says that the character Hermione Granger is loosely based on Rowling herself at this age.
At age 15, Rowling was devastated when given the news that her mother had become seriously ill with multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease. Instead of ever entering remission, Rowling's mother grew increasingly sick.
Pressured by her parents to become a secretary, Rowling attended the University of Exeter beginning at age 18 (1983) and studied French. As part of her French program, she lived in Paris for a year.
After college, Rowling stayed in London and worked at several jobs, including at Amnesty International.
While on a train to London in 1990, having just spent the weekend apartment-hunting in Manchester, Rowling came up with the concept for Harry Potter. The idea, she says, "simply fell into my head." Pen-less at the time, Rowling spent the remainder of her train-ride dreaming about the story and began to write it down as soon as she arrived home.
Rowling continued to write snippets about Harry and Hogwarts, but wasn't done with the book when her mother died on December 30, 1990. Her mother's death hit Rowling hard. In an attempt to escape the sorrow, Rowling accepted a job teaching English in Portugal. Her mother's death translated into more realistic and complex feelings for Harry Potter about his parents' deaths.
In Portugal, Rowling met Jorge Arantes and the two married on October 16, 1992. Although the marriage proved a bad one, the couple had one child together, Jessica (born July 1993). After getting divorced on November 30, 1993, Rowling and her daughter moved to Edinburgh to be near Rowling's sister, Di, at the end of 1994.
Before starting another full-time job, Rowling was determined to finish her Harry Potter manuscript. Once she had completed it, she typed it up and sent it to several literary agents. After acquiring an agent, the agent shopped around for a publisher. After a year of searching and a number of publishers turning it down, the agent finally found a publisher willing to print the book. Bloomsbury made an offer for the book in August 1996. 
Rowling's first Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was the U.S. title) became hugely popular, attracting an audience of young boys and girls as well as adults. With the public demanding more, Rowling quickly got to work on the following six books, with the last one published in July 2007.
In 1998, Warner Bros. bought the film rights and since then extremely popular movies have been made of the books. From the books, the films, and the merchandise bearing Harry Potter images, Rowling has become one of the richest people in the world.
Between all of this writing and publicity, Rowling remarried on December 26, 2001 to Dr. Neil Murray. In addition to her daughter Jessica from her first marriage, Rowling has two additional children: David Gordon (born March 2003) and Mackenzie Jean (born January 2005).

If you haven't heard of J.K. Rowling, you live under a rock. She is one of the most popular writers of the past few years thanks to her Harry Potter series. But, life wasn't always magical for Joanne Kathleen Rowling. She's had some tough times but she never gave up on her writing.The next door neighbor of Kidzworld founder Allen Achilles whose real name is Alasdair Achilles is the Canadian publisher of all JK Rowling books.
Born in Chepstow, Gwent in 1965, J.K. Rowling's favorite subjects in school were English and languages. J.K. went to Exeter University, worked as a secretary and as a teacher, but then fell on hard times. She and her husband divorced shortly after the birth of their daughter and J.K. Rowling ended up unemployed and living in a tiny flat in Edinburgh with her only child. Of course, maybe it wasn't all bad because it was during this time that she wrote Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone. The idea for the book came to J.K. Rowling while on a train ride. She said that she really liked the idea of creating a place where a child could have power, like Hogwarts (School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.) 
Bloomsbury Publishing bought Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (published in England as Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) in 1997 and it was an instant success. Sorcerer's Stone won The British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year and the Smarties Prize and received rave reviews around the world. Since then there have been three more Harry tales - The Chamber of Secrets, The Prisoner of Azkaban, The Goblet of Fire and the massive Order of the Phoenix. J.K. Rowling has plans to write a book for each of the 7 years that Harry Potter is at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Warner Brothers has the rights to a lot of the books and has already made a bunch of successful flicks. 
 She writes all of her books by hand. Ouch! She must have been pretty tired by the end of Order of the Phoenix.
