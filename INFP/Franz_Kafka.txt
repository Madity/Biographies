=======================================================
Kafka was born into a middle-class, German-speaking Jewish family in Prague, the capital of Bohemia, a kingdom that was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father, Hermann Kafka (18521931), was described by Kafka himself as "a true Kafka in strength, health, appetite, loudness of voice, eloquence, self-satisfaction, worldly dominance, endurance, presence of mind, [and] knowledge of human nature ...". Hermann was the fourth child of Jacob Kafka, a butcher, and came to Prague from Osek, a Jewish village near Písek in southern Bohemia. After working as a traveling sales representative, he established himself as an independent retailer of men's and women's fancy goods and accessories, employing up to 15 people and using a jackdaw (kavka in Czech) as his business logo. Kafka's mother, Julie (18561934), was the daughter of Jakob Löwy, a prosperous brewer in Poděbrady, and was better educated than her husband.
Kafka was the eldest of six children. He had two younger brothers, Georg and Heinrich, who died at the ages of fifteen months and six months, respectively, before Kafka was six, and three younger sisters, Gabriele ("Elli") (18891941), Valerie ("Valli") (18901942), and Ottilie ("Ottla") (18921943). On business days, both parents were absent from the home. His mother helped to manage her husband's business and worked in it as much as 12 hours a day. The children were largely reared by a succession of governesses and servants.
Kafka's sisters were sent with their families to the Łódź ghetto and died there or in concentration camps. Ottla is believed to have been sent to the concentration camp at Theresienstadt and then to the death camp at Auschwitz.
Kafka learned German as his first language, but he was also almost fluent in Czech. Later, Kafka also acquired some knowledge of French language and culture; one of his favorite authors was Flaubert. From 1889 to 1893, he attended the Deutsche Knabenschule, the boys' elementary school at the Fleischmarkt (meat market), the street now known as Masná Street in Prague. His Jewish education was limited to his Bar Mitzvah celebration at 13 and going to the synagogue four times a year with his father. [5] After elementary school, he was admitted to the rigorous classics-oriented state gymnasium, Altstädter Deutsches Gymnasium, an academic secondary school with eight grade levels, where German was also the language of instruction, at Staroměstské náměstí, within the Kinsky Palace in the Old Town. He completed his Matura exams in 1901.
Admitted to the Charles University of Prague, Kafka first studied chemistry, but switched after two weeks to law. This offered a range of career possibilities, which pleased his father, and required a longer course of study that gave Kafka time to take classes in German studies and art history. At the university, he joined a student club, named Lese- und Redehalle der Deutschen Studenten, which organized literary events, readings and other activities. In the end of his first year of studies, he met Max Brod, who would become a close friend of his throughout his life, together with the journalist Felix Weltsch, who also studied law. Kafka obtained the degree of Doctor of Law on June 18, 1906 and performed an obligatory year of unpaid service as law clerk for the civil and criminal courts.
On November 1, 1907, he was hired at the Assicurazioni Generali, an aggressive Italian insurance company, where he worked for nearly a year. His correspondence, during that period, witnesses that he was unhappy with his working time schedule - from 8 p.m until 6 a.m - as it made it extremely difficult for him to concentrate on his writing. On July 15, 1908, he resigned, and two weeks later found more congenial employment with the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. However, he did not show any signs of indifference towards his job, as the several promotions that he received during his career prove that he was a hard working employee. In parallel, Kafka was also committed to his literary work. Together with his close friends Max Brod and Felix Weltsch these three were called "Der enge Prager Kreis", the close Prague circle.
In 1911, Karl Hermann, spouse of his sister Elli, proposed Kafka collaborate in the operation of an asbestos factory known as Prager Asbestwerke Hermann and Co. Kafka had to dedicate much of his free time to the business. During that period, he also found interest and entertainment in the performances of Yiddish theatre, despite the misgivings of even close friends such as Max Brod, who usually supported him in everything else. Those performances also served as a starting point for his growing relationship with Judaism.
In 1912, at the home of his lifelong friend Max Brod, Kafka met Felice Bauer, who lived in Berlin and worked as a representative for a dictaphone company. Over the next five years they corresponded a great deal, met occasionally, and twice were engaged to be married. Their relationship finally ended in 1917.
In 1917, Kafka began to suffer from tuberculosis, which would require frequent convalescence during which he was supported by his family, most notably his sister Ottla. Despite his fear of being perceived as both physically and mentally repulsive, he impressed others with his boyish, neat, and austere good looks, a quiet and cool demeanor, obvious intelligence and dry sense of humor.
In the early 1920s he developed an intense relationship with Czech journalist and writer Milena Jesenská. In 1923, he briefly moved to Berlin in the hope of distancing himself from his family's influence to concentrate on his writing. In Berlin, he lived with Dora Diamant, a 25-year-old kindergarten teacher from an orthodox Jewish family, who was independent enough to have escaped her past in the ghetto. Dora became his lover, and influenced Kafka's interest in the Talmud.
It is generally agreed that Kafka suffered from clinical depression and social anxiety throughout his entire life. He also suffered from migraines, insomnia, constipation, boils, and other ailments, all usually brought on by excessive stresses and strains. He attempted to counteract all of this by a regimen of naturopathic treatments, such as a vegetarian diet. However, Kafka's tuberculosis worsened; he returned to Prague, then went to a sanatorium near Vienna for treatment, where he died on June 3, 1924. His body was ultimately brought back to Prague where he was interred on June 11, 1924, in the New Jewish Cemetery in Prague-ikov.

Franz Kafka (1883 - 1924) was one of the most prominent writers to come out of the late nineteenth and early twentieth. His name and style of writing has lent itself to the word Kafkaesque, which signifies the oppressive, bizarre, illogical and nightmarish qualities of his literary production. Dr. James Hawes indicates that Of the world's authors, only Shakespeare generates more PhDs, more biographies, more coffee-table books... Franz Kafkas reputation became so significant to both writers and philosophers. Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari famously studied Kafkas writings in  Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature.
Despite the significance of his work to later writers and thinkers, Franz Kafka did not have much literary success during his lifetime. Few of his works were published when Kafka was alive. Kafkas Max Brod is responsible for editing, completing and preserving many of Kafkas manuscripts.
In 1883, Franz Kafka was born in Prague to a Jewish family. His father owned a dry goods business and had worked tirelessly to remove himself from poverty to prosperity. However, it was only with the dowry from his wife that Herrmann Kafka (Franz Kafkas father) was able to establish his business. Kafkas father reminded his children of the deprivation he had faced as a child. He was also a tyrannical figure in the household. Many view Herrmann Kafka as the archetypal model for many of the antagonists in Franz Kafkas stories.
Franz Kafka faced isolation within his family. In addition, Kafka faced isolation in Prague. His family was part of the German-speaking population, which found itself distrusted by the Czech speaking population of Prague. Kafka also faced a general anti-semitism from the members of the community. Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari would point to this complicated network of identities and languages as a source for Kafkas sophisticated literary production. In Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature, Deleuze and Guattari indicate this complication by saying:
The impossibility of writing other than in German is for the Prague Jews the feeling of an irreducible distance from their primitive Czech territoriality...the impossibility of writing in German is the deterritorialization of the German population itself, an oppressive minority that speaks a language cut off from the masses... paper language or an artificial language, this is all the more true for the Jews who are simultaneously a part of this minority and excluded from it, like gypsies who have stolen a German child from its crib.
Franz Kafkas education began at the German National and Civic Elementary School and continued at the German National Humanistic Gymnasium. The learning experience centered around memorization. In 1901, Kafka was admitted to Ferdinand-Karls University. He began to study the law, in part to satisfy his fathers expectation. In 1906, Kafka would be awarded a Doctorate of Law.
In 1902, Franz Kafka met Max Brod, Oskar Baum and Franz Werfel. These men quickly embraced his intellect as he debated socialism and Zionism. Kafkas colleagues also encouraged him to begin pursuing his literary interests with more interest.  It was also during this period that Kafka began frequenting brothels. Franz Kafkas sexual interests have been suppressed by literary scholars in an attempt to make Kafka seem like a martyr for his art. In fact, serious reflection of his pornography collection was discouraged until Dr. James Hawes recently brought such influences to light. Hawes reveals that Some of it is quite dark, with animals committing fellatio and girl-on-girl action... It's quite unpleasant.
After graduation, Franz Kafkas search for a job superceded his creative production. Kafkas initial belief was that a mindless bureaucratic job would allow him to have the freedom pursue his creative interests. In 1907, Kafka found employment as a clerk in a law office. Later that year, he found a more lucrative position with the Prague office of an insurance company based in Italy. Unfortunately the demands of the job included a sixty-hour workweek, which hindered his artistic production. Ultimately he ended up in the employ of Workmen's Accident Insurance Institute of Prague. This business allowed Kafka more freedom; however, he still felt trapped by the work. This situation was worsened by his fathers acquisition of an asbestos factory that Franz Kafka was expected to help manage. By 1911, Kafkas workload led to his depression and suicidal thoughts.
However, against assumption Franz Kafka did find some pleasure in his work. It is noteworthy that Kafka helped reduce on-the-job injuries in Bavarian factories. Kafkas work was so crucial to industry that he was granted a deferment from serving in the military in World War I.
Felice Bauer and Franz Kafka met in 1912. They quickly were engaged for marriage. The relationship was fraught emotional struggles. The relationship would inspire some of Kafkas most well know works including The Trial and In The Penal Colony. Bauer and Kafka would break their engagement off after five years.
In 1913, Kurt Wolff published a section of Amerika. Wolff published all six volumes of Kafkas work that were published in Kafkas lifetime. Franz Kafka would never obtain the popularity he sought as a writer and would plead with Max Brod to destroy the unpublished and unfinished manuscripts. Brod would refuse this request.
Between 1915 and 1916, Franz Kafka produced no literary works. His guilt over not serving in the military and insomnia complied with his workload to prevent Kafka from working. In 1917, Kafka returned to his creative writing, but moved away from traditional narrative. His work from this period has been described as thinking in images.
1917 was also the year that Franz Kafka was diagnosed with tuberculosis. His employers granted him leave based on his illness. He visited his younger sister, Ottla, in Zuerau, a Bohemian village. After returning to Prague, he contracted influenza and stayed in a sanatorium in Schelesen in 1919. Kafka had produced a lengthy letter in which he expounded on the trouble in his relationship with his father. His mother refused to deliver this note. As his tuberculosis worsened, Franz Kafka spent more times in sanitariums. In 1920 and 1921, Kafka used this time to study Hebrew and to return to Judaism. He also met Milena Jesenska, who would become romantically involved with Franz Kafka. Jesenka would also translate some of his work in to Czech. The relationship would end, but instill more guilt in Kafka.
In 1922, Franz Kafka retired from his job and returned to his parents house. His health deteriorated. In 1924, Kafka went to the Kierling Sanatorium near Vienna where he died. Posthumously much of Kafkas work is viewed as being autobiographically. Stories like A Hunger Artist in which a professional faster eventually kills himself through practicing his art is seen to have particular significance in the context of Kafkas exhausting schedule and devotion to his craft.
The shorter works of Franz Kafka include Description of a Struggle, Wedding Preparations in the Country, Contemplation, The Judgment, The Stoker, In the Penal Colony, The Village Schoolmaster, Blumfeld, an Elderly Bachelor, The Warden of the Tomb, The Hunter Gracchus, The Great Wall of China, A Report to an Academy, Jackals and Arabs, A Country Doctor , A Message from the Emperor, An Old Manuscript, The Refusal, A Hunger Artist, Investigations of a Dog, A Little Woman, First Sorrow, The Burrow, Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk, and The Metamorphosis.

=======================================================
Franz Kafka was born into a middle-class, German-speaking Jewish family on July 3, 1883 in Prague, Bohemia, now the Czech Republic.
Franz was the eldest of six children. He had two younger brothers who died in infancy and three younger sisters (Gabriele (1889–1941), Valerie (1890–1942), Ottilie (1892–1943), all of whom perished in concentration camps.
His father, Hermann Kafka (1852–1931), was described as a huge ill-tempered domestic tyrant, who on many occasions directed his anger towards his son and was disrespectful towards his escape into literature.
Kafka's father was a businessman who established himself as an independent retailer of men's and women's fancy goods and accessories, employing up to 15 people.
Kafka's mother, Julie (1856—1934), was the daughter of a prosperous brewer and was better educated than her husband. She helped to manage her husband's business and worked in it as much as 12 hours a day. The children were largely raised by a series of governesses and servants.
From 1889 to 1893, Franz attended the Deutsche Knabenschule, the boys elementary school in Prague. He was sent to German schools, not Czech, which demonstrates his father's desire for social advancement. His Jewish upbringing was limited mostly to his bar mizvah and going to the synagogue four times a year with his father, which didn't give him much to go on.
In 1901 he graduated from the Altstädter Gymnasium, the rigorous classics-oriented secondary school with eight grade levels. He did well in school, taking classes like Latin, Greek and history.
After secondary school he went on to Charles Ferdinand University, where at first he decided to study chemistry, but switched after two weeks to law.
In the end of his first year, he met another student a year younger than he was, Max Brod, who would become a close friend of his throughout his life, together with the journalist Felix Weltsch, who also studied law.
Kafka obtained the degree of Doctor of Law on June 18, 1906 and performed an obligatory year of unpaid service as law clerk for the civil and criminal courts.
At the end of 1907 Kafka started working in a huge Italian insurance company, where he stayed for nearly a year. His correspondence during that period witnesses that he was unhappy with his working time schedule - from 8 p.m (20:00) until 6 a.m (06:00) - as it made it extremely difficult for him to concentrate on his writing. On July 15, 1908, he resigned, and few weeks later found more suitable employment with the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. He worked there until July 1922 when he retired for reasons of ill health.
He often referred to his job as insurance officer as a "bread job", a job done only to pay the bills. However, he did not show any signs of indifference towards his job, as the several promotions that he received during his career prove that he was a hardworking employee. In parallel, Kafka was also committed to his literary work.
In 1912, at the home of his lifelong friend Max Brod, Kafka met Felice Bauer, who lived in Berlin. Over the next five years they corresponded a great deal, met occasionally, and twice were engaged to be married. Their relationship finally ended in 1917.
In 1917, Kafka began to suffer from tuberculosis, which would require frequent convalescence during which he was supported by his family, most notably his sister Ottla. In the early 1920s he developed an intense relationship with Czech journalist and writer Milena Jesenská. 
In 1923, he briefly moved to Berlin in the hope of distancing himself from his family's influence to concentrate on his writing. In Berlin, he lived with Dora Diamant, a 25-year-old kindergarten teacher from an orthodox Jewish family, who was independent enough to have escaped her past in the ghetto. Dora became his lover, and influenced Kafka's interest in the Talmud - a book of Jewish law.
It is generally agreed that Kafka suffered from clinical depression and social anxiety throughout his entire life. He also suffered from migraines, insomnia, constipation, boils, and other ailments, all usually brought on by excessive stresses and strains. He attempted to counteract all of this by a regimen of naturopathic treatments, such as a vegetarian diet and the consumption of large quantities of unpasteurized milk. 
Despite all that, his tuberculosis worsened; he returned to Prague, then went to Dr. Hoffmann sanatorium for treatment, where he died on June 3, 1924. His remains are buried alongside his parent's under a two-meter obelisk in Prague's New Jewish Cemetery in Olsanske.
=======================================================
Franz Kafka[a] (3 July 1883 – 3 June 1924) was a German-language writer of novels and short stories, regarded by critics as one of the most influential authors of the 20th century. Kafka strongly influenced genres such as existentialism. Most of his works, such as "Die Verwandlung" ("The Metamorphosis"), Der Prozess (The Trial), and Das Schloss (The Castle), are filled with the themes and archetypes of alienation, physical and psychological brutality, parent–child conflict, characters on a terrifying quest, labyrinths of bureaucracy, and mystical transformations.
Kafka was born into a middle-class, German-speaking Jewish family in Prague, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In his lifetime, most of the population of Prague spoke Czech, and the division between Czech- and German-speaking people was a tangible reality, as both groups were strengthening their national identity. The Jewish community often found itself in between the two sentiments, naturally raising questions about a place to which one belongs. Kafka himself was fluent in both languages, considering German his mother tongue.
Kafka trained as a lawyer and, after completing his legal education, obtained employment with an insurance company. He began to write short stories in his spare time. For the rest of his life, he complained about the little time he had to devote to what he came to regard as his calling. He regretted having to devote so much attention to his Brotberuf ("day job", literally "bread job"). Kafka preferred to communicate by letter; he wrote hundreds of letters to family and close female friends, including his father, his fiancée Felice Bauer, and his youngest sister Ottla. He had a complicated and troubled relationship with his father that had a major effect on his writing. He also suffered conflict over being Jewish, feeling that it had little to do with him, although critics argue that it influenced his writing.
Only a few of Kafka's works were published during his lifetime: the story collections Betrachtung (Contemplation) and Ein Landarzt (A Country Doctor), and individual stories (such as "Die Verwandlung") in literary magazines. He prepared the story collection Ein Hungerkünstler (A Hunger Artist) for print, but it was not published until after his death. Kafka's unfinished works, including his novels Der Prozess, Das Schloss and Amerika (also known as Der Verschollene, The Man Who Disappeared), were published posthumously, mostly by his friend Max Brod, who ignored Kafka's wish to have the manuscripts destroyed. Albert Camus, Gabriel García Márquez and Jean-Paul Sartre are among the writers influenced by Kafka's work; the term Kafkaesque has entered the English language to describe surreal situations like those in his writing.
Kafka was born near the Old Town Square in Prague, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His family were middle-class Ashkenazi Jews. His father, Hermann Kafka (1852–1931), was the fourth child of Jakob Kafka,[3][4] a shochet or ritual slaughterer in Osek, a Czech village with a large Jewish population located near Strakonice in southern Bohemia.[5] Hermann brought the Kafka family to Prague. After working as a travelling sales representative, he eventually became a fancy goods and clothing retailer who employed up to 15 people and used the image of a jackdaw (kavka in Czech) as his business logo.[6] Kafka's mother, Julie (1856–1934), was the daughter of Jakob Löwy, a prosperous retail merchant in Poděbrady,[7] and was better educated than her husband.[3] Kafka's parents probably spoke a variety of German influenced by Yiddish that was sometimes pejoratively called Mauscheldeutsch, but, as the German language was considered the vehicle of social mobility, they probably encouraged their children to speak High German.[8] Hermann and Julie had six children, of whom Franz was the eldest.[9] Franz's two brothers, Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy before Franz was seven; his three sisters were Gabriele ("Ellie") (1889–1944), Valerie ("Valli") (1890–1942) and Ottilie ("Ottla") (1892–1943). They all died during the Holocaust of World War II. Valli was deported to the Łódź Ghetto in Poland in 1942, but that is the last documentation of her.
Hermann is described by the biographer Stanley Corngold as a "huge, selfish, overbearing businessman"[10] and by Franz Kafka as "a true Kafka in strength, health, appetite, loudness of voice, eloquence, self-satisfaction, worldly dominance, endurance, presence of mind, [and] knowledge of human nature".[11] On business days, both parents were absent from the home, with Julie Kafka working as many as 12 hours each day helping to manage the family business. Consequently, Kafka's childhood was somewhat lonely,[12] and the children were reared largely by a series of governesses and servants. Kafka's troubled relationship with his father is evident in his Brief an den Vater (Letter to His Father) of more than 100 pages, in which he complains of being profoundly affected by his father's authoritarian and demanding character;[13] his mother, in contrast, was quiet and shy.[14] The dominating figure of Kafka's father had a significant influence on Kafka's writing.[15]
The Kafka family had a servant girl living with them in a cramped apartment. Franz's room was often cold. In November 1913 the family moved into a bigger apartment, although Ellie and Valli had married and moved out of the first apartment. In early August 1914, just after World War I began, the sisters did not know where their husbands were in the military and moved back in with the family in this larger apartment. Both Ellie and Valli also had children. Franz at age 31 moved into Valli's former apartment, quiet by contrast, and lived by himself for the first time.[16]
From 1889 to 1893, Kafka attended the Deutsche Knabenschule German boys' elementary school at the Masný trh/Fleischmarkt (meat market), now known as Masná Street. His Jewish education ended with his Bar Mitzvah celebration at the age of 13. Kafka never enjoyed attending the synagogue and went with his father only on four high holidays a year.[11][17][18]
After leaving elementary school in 1893, Kafka was admitted to the rigorous classics-oriented state gymnasium, Altstädter Deutsches Gymnasium, an academic secondary school at Old Town Square, within the Kinsky Palace. German was the language of instruction, but Kafka also spoke and wrote in Czech;[19][20] he studied the latter at the gymnasium for eight years, achieving good grades.[21] Although Kafka received compliments for his Czech, he never considered himself fluent in Czech, though he spoke German with a Czech accent.[1][20] He completed his Matura exams in 1901.[22]
Admitted to the Deutsche Karl-Ferdinands-Universität of Prague in 1901, Kafka began studying chemistry, but switched to law after two weeks.[23] Although this field did not excite him, it offered a range of career possibilities which pleased his father. In addition, law required a longer course of study, giving Kafka time to take classes in German studies and art history.[24] He also joined a student club, Lese-und Redehalle der Deutschen Studenten (Reading and Lecture Hall of the German students), which organized literary events, readings and other activities.[25] Among Kafka's friends were the journalist Felix Weltsch, who studied philosophy, the actor Yitzchak Lowy who came from an orthodox Hasidic Warsaw family, and the writers Oskar Baum and Franz Werfel.[26]
At the end of his first year of studies, Kafka met Max Brod, a fellow law student who became a close friend for life.[25] Brod soon noticed that, although Kafka was shy and seldom spoke, what he said was usually profound.[27] Kafka was an avid reader throughout his life;[28] together he and Brod read Plato's Protagoras in the original Greek, on Brod's initiative, and Flaubert's L'éducation sentimentale (Sentimental Education) and La Tentation de St. Antoine (The Temptation of Saint Anthony) in French, at his own suggestion.[29] Kafka considered Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Flaubert, Franz Grillparzer,[30] and Heinrich von Kleist to be his "true blood brothers".[31] Besides these, he took an interest in Czech literature[19][20] and was also very fond of the works of Goethe.[32][33] Kafka obtained the degree of Doctor of Law on 18 July 1906[b] and performed an obligatory year of unpaid service as law clerk for the civil and criminal courts.[36]
On 1 November 1907, Kafka was hired at the Assicurazioni Generali, an Italian insurance company, where he worked for nearly a year. His correspondence during that period indicates that he was unhappy with a working time schedule—from 08:00 until 18:00[37][38]—making it extremely difficult to concentrate on writing, which was assuming increasing importance to him. On 15 July 1908, he resigned. Two weeks later he found employment more amenable to writing when he joined the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. The job involved investigating and assessing compensation for personal injury to industrial workers; accidents such as lost fingers or limbs were commonplace at this time. The management professor Peter Drucker credits Kafka with developing the first civilian hard hat while employed at the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute, but this is not supported by any document from his employer.[39][40] His father often referred to his son's job as an insurance officer as a Brotberuf, literally "bread job", a job done only to pay the bills; Kafka often claimed to despise it. Kafka was rapidly promoted and his duties included processing and investigating compensation claims, writing reports, and handling appeals from businessmen who thought their firms had been placed in too high a risk category, which cost them more in insurance premiums.[41] He would compile and compose the annual report on the insurance institute for the several years he worked there. The reports were received well by his superiors.[42] Kafka usually got off work at 2 p.m., so that he had time to spend on his literary work, to which he was committed.[43] Kafka's father also expected him to help out at and take over the family fancy goods store.[44] In his later years, Kafka's illness often prevented him from working at the insurance bureau and at his writing. Years later, Brod coined the term Der enge Prager Kreis ("The Close Prague Circle") to describe the group of writers, which included Kafka, Felix Weltsch and him.[45][46]
In late 1911, Elli's husband Karl Hermann and Kafka became partners in the first asbestos factory in Prague, known as Prager Asbestwerke Hermann & Co., having used dowry money from Hermann Kafka. Kafka showed a positive attitude at first, dedicating much of his free time to the business, but he later resented the encroachment of this work on his writing time.[47] During that period, he also found interest and entertainment in the performances of Yiddish theatre. After seeing a Yiddish theater troupe perform in October 1911, for the next six months Kafka "immersed himself in Yiddish language and in Yiddish literature".[48] This interest also served as a starting point for his growing exploration of Judaism.[49] It was at about this time that Kafka became a vegetarian.[50] Around 1915 Kafka received his draft notice for military service in World War I, but his employers at the insurance institute arranged for a deferment because his work was considered essential government service. Later he attempted to join the military but was prevented from doing so by medical problems associated with tuberculosis,[51] with which he was diagnosed in 1917.[52] In 1918 the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute put Kafka on a pension due to his illness, for which there was no cure at the time, and he spent most of the rest of his life in sanatoriums.[36]
Kafka had an active sex life. According to Brod, Kafka was "tortured" by sexual desire[53] and Kafka's biographer Reiner Stach states that his life was full of "incessant womanising" and that he was filled with a fear of "sexual failure".[54] He visited brothels for most of his adult life[55][56][57] and was interested in pornography.[53] In addition, he had close relationships with several women during his life. On 13 August 1912, Kafka met Felice Bauer, a relative of Brod, who worked in Berlin as a representative of a dictaphone company. A week after the meeting at Brod's home, Kafka wrote in his diary:
Miss FB. When I arrived at Brod's on 13 August, she was sitting at the table. I was not at all curious about who she was, but rather took her for granted at once. Bony, empty face that wore its emptiness openly. Bare throat. A blouse thrown on. Looked very domestic in her dress although, as it turned out, she by no means was. (I alienate myself from her a little by inspecting her so closely ...) Almost broken nose. Blonde, somewhat straight, unattractive hair, strong chin. As I was taking my seat I looked at her closely for the first time, by the time I was seated I already had an unshakeable opinion.[58][59]
Shortly after this, Kafka wrote the story "Das Urteil" ("The Judgment") in only one night, and worked in a productive period on Der Verschollene (The Man Who Disappeared) and "Die Verwandlung" ("The Metamorphosis"). Kafka and Felice Bauer communicated mostly through letters over the next five years, met occasionally, and were engaged twice.[60] Kafka's extant letters to her were published as Briefe an Felice (Letters to Felice); her letters do not survive.[58][61][62] According to biographers Stach and James Hawes, around 1920 Kafka was engaged a third time, to Julie Wohryzek, a poor and uneducated hotel chambermaid.[60][63] Although the two rented a flat and set a wedding date, the marriage never took place. During this time Kafka began a draft of the Letter to His Father, who objected to Julie because of her Zionist beliefs. Before the date of the intended marriage, he took up with yet another woman.[64] While he needed women and sex in his life, he had low self-confidence, felt sex was dirty, and was shy—especially about his body.[36]
Stach and Brod state that during the time that Kafka knew Felice Bauer, he had an affair with a friend of hers, Margarethe "Grete" Bloch,[65] a Jewish woman from Berlin. Brod says that Bloch gave birth to Kafka's son, although Kafka never knew about the child. The boy, whose name is not known, was born in 1914 or 1915 and died in Munich in 1921.[66][67] But, Kafka's biographer Peter-André Alt claims that, while Bloch had a son, Kafka was not the father as the pair were never intimate.[68][69] Stach states that Bloch had a son, but there is not solid proof but contradictory evidence that Kafka was the father.[70]
Kafka was diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) in August 1917 and moved for a few months to the Bohemian village of Zürau (Siřem in Czech language), where his sister Ottla worked on the farm of her brother-in-law Hermann. He felt comfortable there and later described this time as perhaps the best time in his life, probably because he had no responsibilities. He kept diaries and Oktavhefte (octavo). From the notes in these books, Kafka extracted 109 numbered pieces of text on Zettel, single pieces of paper in no given order. They were later published as Die Zürauer Aphorismen oder Betrachtungen über Sünde, Hoffnung, Leid und den wahren Weg (The Zürau Aphorisms or Reflections on Sin, Hope, Suffering, and the True Way).[71]
In 1920 Kafka began an intense relationship with Milena Jesenská, a Czech journalist and writer. His letters to her were later published as Letters to Milena. [72] During a vacation in July 1923 to Graal-Müritz on the Baltic Sea, Kafka met Dora Diamant, a 25-year-old kindergarten teacher from an orthodox Jewish family. Kafka, hoping to escape the influence of his family to concentrate on his writing, moved briefly to Berlin and lived with Diamant. She became his lover and caused him to become interested in the Talmud.[73] He worked on four stories, which he prepared to be published as Ein Hungerkünstler (A Hunger Artist).[72]
Kafka feared that people would find him mentally and physically repulsive. However, those who met him perceived him to possess a quiet and cool demeanor, obvious intelligence, and a dry sense of humour; they also found him boyishly handsome, although of austere appearance.[74][75][76] Brod compared Kafka to Heinrich von Kleist, noting that both writers had the ability to realistically describe a situation with precise details.[77] Brod thought Kafka was one of the most entertaining people he had met; Kafka enjoyed sharing humour with his friends, but also helped them in difficult situations with good advice.[78] According to Brod, he was a passionate reciter, who was able to phrase his speaking as if it were music.[79] Brod felt that two of Kafka's most distinguishing traits were "absolute truthfulness" (absolute Wahrhaftigkeit) and "precise conscientiousness" (präzise Gewissenhaftigkeit).[80][81] He explored the detail, the inconspicuous, profoundly with such love and precision that things surfaced that had been unforeseen, that seemed strange, but were nothing but true (nichts als wahr).[82]
Although Kafka showed little interest in exercise as a child, he later showed interest in games and physical activity,[28] as a good rider, swimmer, and rower.[80] On weekends he and his friends embarked on long hikes, often planned by Kafka himself.[83] His other interests included alternative medicine, modern education systems such as Montessori,[80] and technical novelties such as airplanes and film.[84] Writing was important to Kafka; he considered it a "form of prayer".[85] He was very sensitive to noise and preferred quiet when writing.[86]
Pérez-Álvarez has claimed that Kafka may have possessed a schizoid personality disorder.[87] His style, they claim, not only in "Die Verwandlung" ("The Metamorphosis"), but in various other writings, appears to show low to medium-level schizoid characteristics, which explain much of his surprising work.[88] His anguish can be seen in this diary entry from 21 June 1913:[89]
The tremendous world I have in my head. But how to free myself and free them without ripping apart. And a thousand times rather tear in me they hold back or buried. For this I'm here, that's quite clear to me.[90]
Man cannot live without a permanent trust in something indestructible within himself, though both that indestructible something and his own trust in it may remain permanently concealed from him.[91]
Though Kafka never married, he held marriage and children in high esteem. He had several girlfriends,[92] but some academics have speculated about his sexuality. Others have suggested he may have suffered from an eating disorder. Doctor Manfred M. Fichter of the Psychiatric Clinic, University of Munich, presented "evidence for the hypothesis that the writer Franz Kafka had suffered from an atypical anorexia nervosa",[93] and that Kafka was not just lonely and depressed but also "occasionally suicidal".[75] In his 1995 book Franz Kafka, the Jewish Patient, Sander Gilman investigated "why a Jew might have been considered 'hypochondriac' or 'homosexual' and how Kafka incorporates aspects of these ways of understanding the Jewish male into his own self-image and writing".[94] Kafka considered committing suicide at least once, in late 1912.[95]
Prior to World War I,[96] Kafka attended several meetings of the Klub Mladých, a Czech anarchist, anti-militarist, and anti-clerical organization.[97] Hugo Bergmann, who attended the same elementary and high schools as Kafka, fell out with Kafka during their last academic year (1900–1901) because "[Kafka's] socialism and my Zionism were much too strident".[98][99] "Franz became a socialist, I became a Zionist in 1898. The synthesis of Zionism and socialism did not yet exist".[99] Bergmann claims that Kafka wore a red carnation to school to show his support for socialism.[99] In one diary entry, Kafka made reference to the influential anarchist philosopher Prince Peter Kropotkin: "Don't forget Kropotkin!"[100]
During the communist era, the legacy of Kafka's work for Eastern bloc socialism was hotly debated. Opinions ranged from the notion that he satirised the bureaucratic bungling of a crumbling Austria-Hungarian Empire, to the belief that he embodied the rise of socialism.[101] A further key point was Marx's theory of alienation. While the orthodox position was that Kafka's depictions of alienation were no longer relevant for a society that had supposedly eliminated alienation, a 1963 conference held in Liblice, Czechoslovakia, on the eightieth anniversary of his birth, reassessed the importance of Kafka's portrayal of bureaucracy.[102] Whether or not Kafka was a political writer is still an issue of debate.[103]
Kafka grew up in Prague as a German-speaking Jew.[104] He was deeply fascinated by the Jews of Eastern Europe, who he thought possessed an intensity of spiritual life that was absent from Jews in the West. His diary is full of references to Yiddish writers.[105] Yet he was at times alienated from Judaism and Jewish life: "What have I in common with Jews? I have hardly anything in common with myself and should stand very quietly in a corner, content that I can breathe".[106] In his adolescent years, Kafka had declared himself an atheist.[107]
Hawes suggests that Kafka, though very aware of his own Jewishness, did not incorporate it into his work, which, according to Hawes, lacks Jewish characters, scenes or themes.[108][109][110] In the opinion of literary critic Harold Bloom, although Kafka was uneasy with his Jewish heritage, he was the quintessential Jewish writer.[111] Lothar Kahn is likewise unequivocal: "The presence of Jewishness in Kafka's oeuvre is no longer subject to doubt".[112] Pavel Eisner, one of Kafka's first translators, interprets the classic, Der Process (The Trial) as the embodiment of the "triple dimension of Jewish existence in Prague ... his protagonist Josef K. is (symbolically) arrested by a German (Rabensteiner), a Czech (Kullich) and a Jew (Kaminer). He stands for the 'guiltless guilt' that imbues the Jew in the modern world, although there is no evidence that he himself is a Jew".[113]
In his essay Sadness in Palestine?!, Dan Miron explores Kafka's connection to Zionism: "It seems that those who claim that there was such a connection and that Zionism played a central role in his life and literary work, and those who deny the connection altogether or dismiss its importance, are both wrong. The truth lies in some very elusive place between these two simplistic poles".[105] Kafka considered moving to Palestine with Felice Bauer, and later with Dora Diamant. He studied Hebrew while living in Berlin, hiring a friend of Brod's from Palestine, Pua Bat-Tovim, to tutor him[105] and attending Rabbi Julius Grünthal's[114] and Rabbi Julius Guttmann's classes in the Berlin Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums (Berlin College for the Study of Judaism).[115]
Livia Rothkirchen calls Kafka the "symbolic figure of his era".[113] His contemporaries included numerous Jewish writers (Czech, German and national Jews) who were sensitive to German, Czech, Austrian and Jewish culture. According to Rothkirchen, "This situation lent their writings a broad cosmopolitan outlook and a quality of exaltation bordering on transcendental metaphysical contemplation. An illustrious example is Franz Kafka".[113]
Towards the end of his life Kafka sent a postcard to his friend Hugo Bergman in Tel Aviv, announcing his intention to immigrate to Palestine. Bergman refused to host Kafka because he had young children and was afraid that Kafka would infect them with tuberculosis.[116]
Kafka's laryngeal tuberculosis worsened and in March 1924 he returned from Berlin to Prague,[60] where members of his family, principally his sister Ottla, took care of him. He went to Dr. Hoffmann's sanatorium in Kierling near Vienna for treatment on 10 April,[72] and died there on 3 June 1924. His cause of death seemed to be starvation: the condition of Kafka's throat made eating too painful for him, and since parenteral nutrition had not yet been developed, there was no way to feed him.[117][118] Kafka was editing "A Hunger Artist" on his deathbed, a story whose composition he had begun before his throat closed to the point that he could not take any nourishment.[119] His body was brought back to Prague where he was buried on 11 June 1924, in the New Jewish Cemetery in Prague-Žižkov.[56] Kafka was unknown during his own lifetime, but he did not consider fame important. He became famous soon after his death.[85]
All of Kafka's published works, except some letters he wrote in Czech to Milena Jesenská, were written in German. What little was published during his lifetime attracted scant public attention.
Kafka finished none of his full-length novels and burned around 90 percent of his work,[120][121] much during the period he lived in Berlin with Diamant who helped him burn the drafts.[122] In his early years as a writer, he was influenced by von Kleist, whose work he described in a letter to Bauer as frightening and whom he considered closer than his own family.[123]
Kafka's earliest published works were eight stories which appeared in 1908 in the first issue of the literary journal Hyperion under the title Betrachtung (Contemplation). He wrote the story "Beschreibung eines Kampfes" ("Description of a Struggle")[c] in 1904; he showed it to Brod in 1905 who advised him to continue writing and convinced him to submit it to Hyperion. Kafka published a fragment in 1908[124] and two sections in the spring of 1909, all in Munich.[125]
In a creative outburst on the night of 22 September 1912, Kafka wrote the story "Das Urteil" ("The Judgment", literally: "The Verdict") and dedicated it to Felice Bauer. Brod noted the similarity in names of the main character and his fictional fiancée, Georg Bendemann and Frieda Brandenfeld, to Franz Kafka and Felice Bauer.[126] The story is often considered as Kafka's breakthrough work. It deals with the troubled relationship of a son and his dominant father, facing a new situation after the son's engagement.[127][128] Kafka later described writing in "a complete opening of body and soul"[129] a story that "evolved as a true birth, covered with filth and slime".[130] The story was first published in Leipzig in 1912 and dedicated "to Miss Felice Bauer", and in subsequent editions "for F."[72]
In 1912, Kafka wrote the story "Die Verwandlung" ("The Metamorphosis", or "The Transformation"),[131] published in 1915 in Leipzig. The story begins with a travelling salesman waking to find himself transformed into a ungeheuren Ungeziefer, a monstrous vermin, Ungeziefer being a general term for unwanted and unclean animals. Critics regard the work as one of the seminal works of fiction of the 20th century.[132][133][134] The story "In der Strafkolonie" ("In the Penal Colony"), dealing with an elaborate torture and execution device, was written in October 1914,[72] revised in 1918, and published in Leipzig during October 1919. The story "Ein Hungerkünstler" ("A Hunger Artist"), published in the periodical Die neue Rundschau in 1924, describes a victimized protagonist who experiences a decline in the appreciation of his strange craft of starving himself for extended periods.[135] His last story, "Josefine, die Sängerin oder Das Volk der Mäuse" ("Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk"), also deals with the relationship between an artist and his audience.[136]
He began his first novel project in 1912;[137] its first chapter is the story "Der Heizer" ("The Stoker"). Kafka called the work, which remained unfinished, Der Verschollene (The Man Who Disappeared or The Missing Man), but when Brod published it after Kafka's death, he named it Amerika.[138] The inspiration for the novel was the time spent in the audience of Yiddish theatre the previous year, bringing him to a new awareness of his heritage, which led to the thought that an innate appreciation for one's heritage lives deep within each person.[139] More explicitly humorous and slightly more realistic than most of Kafka's works, the novel shares the motif of an oppressive and intangible system putting the protagonist repeatedly in bizarre situations.[140] It uses many details of experiences of his relatives who had emigrated to America[141] and is the only work for which Kafka ever considered an optimistic ending.[142]
During 1914, Kafka began the novel Der Process (The Trial),[125] the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader. Kafka did not complete the novel, although he finished the final chapter. According to Nobel Prize winner and Kafka scholar Elias Canetti, Felice is central to the plot of Der Process and Kafka said it was "her story".[143][144] Canetti titled his book on Kafka's letters to Felice Kafka's Other Trial, in recognition of the relationship between the letters and the novel.[144] Michiko Kakutani notes in a review for The New York Times that Kafka's letters have the "earmarks of his fiction: the same nervous attention to minute particulars; the same paranoid awareness of shifting balances of power; the same atmosphere of emotional suffocation—combined, surprisingly enough, with moments of boyish ardor and delight."[144]
According to his diary, Kafka was already planning his novel Das Schloss (The Castle), by 11 June 1914; however, he did not begin writing it until 27 January 1922.[125] The protagonist is the Landvermesser (land surveyor) named K., who struggles for unknown reasons to gain access to the mysterious authorities of a castle who govern the village. Kafka's intent was that the castle's authorities notify K. on his deathbed that his "legal claim to live in the village was not valid, yet, taking certain auxiliary circumstances into account, he was to be permitted to live and work there".[145] Dark and at times surreal, the novel is focused on alienation, bureaucracy, the seemingly endless frustrations of man's attempts to stand against the system, and the futile and hopeless pursuit of an unobtainable goal. Hartmut M. Rastalsky noted in his thesis: "Like dreams, his texts combine precise "realistic" detail with absurdity, careful observation and reasoning on the part of the protagonists with inexplicable obliviousness and carelessness."[146]
Kafka's stories were initially published in literary periodicals. His first eight were printed in 1908 in the first issue of the bi-monthly Hyperion.[147] Franz Blei published two dialogues in 1909 which became part of "Beschreibung eines Kampfes" ("Description of a Struggle").[147] A fragment of the story "Die Aeroplane in Brescia" ("The Aeroplanes at Brescia"), written on a trip to Italy with Brod, appeared in the daily Bohemia on 28 September 1909.[147][148] On 27 March 1910, several stories that later became part of the book Betrachtung were published in the Easter edition of Bohemia.[147][149] In Leipzig during 1913, Brod and publisher Kurt Wolff included "Das Urteil. Eine Geschichte von Franz Kafka." ("The Verdict. A Story by Franz Kafka.") in their literary yearbook for the art poetry Arkadia. The story "Vor dem Gesetz" ("Before the Law") was published in the 1915 New Year's edition of the independent Jewish weekly Selbstwehr; it was reprinted in 1919 as part of the story collection Ein Landarzt (A Country Doctor) and became part of the novel Der Process. Other stories were published in various publications, including Brod's Der Jude, the paper Prager Tagblatt, and the periodicals Die neue Rundschau, Genius, and Prager Presse.[147]
Kafka's first published book, Betrachtung (Contemplation, or Meditation), was a collection of 18 stories written between 1904 and 1912. On a summer trip to Weimar, Brod initiated a meeting between Kafka and Kurt Wolff;[150] Wolff published Betrachtung in the Rowohlt Verlag at the end of 1912 (with the year given as 1913).[151] Kafka dedicated it to Brod, "Für M.B.", and added in the personal copy given to his friend "So wie es hier schon gedruckt ist, für meinen liebsten Max — Franz K." ("As it is already printed here, for my dearest Max").[152]
Kafka's story "Die Verwandlung" ("The Metamorphosis") was first printed in the October 1915 issue of Die Weißen Blätter, a monthly edition of expressionist literature, edited by René Schickele.[151] Another story collection, Ein Landarzt (A Country Doctor), was published by Kurt Wolff in 1919,[151] dedicated to Kafka's father.[153] Kafka prepared a final collection of four stories for print, Ein Hungerkünstler (A Hunger Artist), which appeared in 1924 after his death, in Verlag Die Schmiede. On 20 April 1924, the Berliner Börsen-Courier published Kafka's essay on Adalbert Stifter.[154]
Kafka left his work, both published and unpublished, to his friend and literary executor Max Brod with explicit instructions that it should be destroyed on Kafka's death; Kafka wrote: "Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me ... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others'), sketches, and so on, [is] to be burned unread".[155][156] Brod decided to ignore this request and published the novels and collected works between 1925 and 1935. He took many papers, which remain unpublished, with him in suitcases to Palestine when he fled there in 1939.[157] Kafka's last lover, Dora Diamant (later, Dymant-Lask), also ignored his wishes, secretly keeping 20 notebooks and 35 letters. These were confiscated by the Gestapo in 1933, but scholars continue to search for them.[158]
As Brod published the bulk of the writing in his possession,[159] Kafka's work began to attract wider attention and critical acclaim. Brod found it difficult to compile Kafka's notebooks into chronological order. One problem was that Kafka often began writing in different parts of the book; sometimes in the middle, sometimes working backwards from the end.[160][161] Brod finished many of Kafka's incomplete works to allow their publication. For example, Kafka left Der Process with unnumbered and incomplete chapters and Das Schloss with incomplete sentences and ambiguous content;[161] Brod rearranged chapters, copyedited the text, and changed the punctuation. Der Process appeared in 1925 in Verlag Die Schmiede. Kurt Wolff published two other novels, Das Schloss in 1926 and Amerika in 1927. In 1931, Brod edited a collection of prose and unpublished stories as Beim Bau der Chinesischen Mauer (The Great Wall of China), including the story of the same name. The book appeared in the Gustav Kiepenheuer Verlag. Brod's sets are usually called the Definitive Editions.[162]
In 1961, Malcolm Pasley acquired most of Kafka's original handwritten work for the Oxford Bodleian Library.[163][164] The text for Der Process was later purchased through auction and is stored at the German Literary Archives in Marbach am Neckar, Germany.[164][165] Subsequently, Pasley headed a team (including Gerhard Neumann, Jost Schillemeit and Jürgen Born) which reconstructed the German novels; S. Fischer Verlag republished them.[166] Pasley was the editor for Das Schloss, published in 1982, and Der Process (The Trial), published in 1990. Jost Schillemeit was the editor of Der Verschollene (Amerika) published in 1983. These are called the "Critical Editions" or the "Fischer Editions".[167]
When Brod died in 1968, he left Kafka's unpublished papers, which are believed to number in the thousands, to his secretary Esther Hoffe.[168] She released or sold some, but left most to her daughters, Eva and Ruth, who also refused to release the papers. A court battle began in 2008 between the sisters and the National Library of Israel, which claimed these works became the property of the nation of Israel when Brod emigrated to British Palestine in 1939. Esther Hoffe sold the original manuscript of Der Process for US$2 million in 1988 to the German Literary Archive Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach am Neckar.[120][169] Only Eva is still alive as of 2012.[170] A ruling by a Tel Aviv family court in 2010 held that the papers must be released and a few were, including a previously unknown story, but the legal battle continued.[171] The Hoffes claim the papers are their personal property, while the National Library argues they are "cultural assets belonging to the Jewish people".[171] The National Library also suggests that Brod bequeathed the papers to them in his will. The Tel Aviv Family Court ruled in October 2012 that the papers were the property of the National Library.[172]
Many critics have praised Kafka's writing. The poet W. H. Auden called Kafka "the Dante of the twentieth century";[173] the novelist Vladimir Nabokov placed him among the greatest writers of the 20th century.[174] Gabriel García Márquez noted the reading of Kafka's "The Metamorphosis" showed him "that it was possible to write in a different way".[106][175] The core theme of Kafka's work, first established in the short story "Das Urteil",[176] is father-son conflict: the guilt induced in the son is resolved through suffering and atonement.[13][176] Other prominent themes and archetypes include alienation, physical and psychological brutality, characters on a terrifying quest, and mystical transformation.[177]
Kafka's style has been compared to that of Kleist as early as 1916, in a review of "Die Verwandlung" and "Der Heizer" by Oscar Walzel in Berliner Beiträge.[178] The nature of Kafka's prose allows for varied interpretations and critics have placed his writing into a variety of literary schools.[103] Marxists, for example, have sharply disagreed over how to interpret Kafka's works.[97][103] Some accused him of distorting reality whereas others claimed he was critiquing capitalism.[103] The hopelessness and absurdity common to his works are seen as emblematic of existentialism.[179] Some of Kafka's books are influenced by the expressionist movement, though the majority of his literary output was associated with the experimental modernist genre. Kafka also touches on the theme of human conflict with bureaucracy. William Burrows claims that such work is centred on the concepts of struggle, pain, solitude, and the need for relationships.[180] Others, such as Thomas Mann, see Kafka's work as allegorical: a quest, metaphysical in nature, for God.[181][182]
According to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, the themes of alienation and persecution, although present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They point out that reading his work while focusing on the futility of his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play at humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds.[183][184] Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer Milan Kundera suggests that Kafka's surrealist humour may have been an inversion of Dostoyevsky who presented characters who were punished for a crime. In Kafka's work a character will be punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and living in a totalitarian state.[185]
Attempts have been made to identify the influence of Kafka's legal background and the role of law in his fiction.[186][187] Most interpretations identify aspects of law and legality as important in his work,[188] in which the legal system is often oppressive.[189] The law in Kafka's works, rather than being representative of any particular legal or political entity, is usually interpreted to represent a collection of anonymous, incomprehensible forces. These are hidden from the individual but control the lives of the people, who are innocent victims of systems beyond their control.[188] Critics who support this absurdist interpretation cite instances where Kafka describes himself in conflict with an absurd universe, such as the following entry from his diary:
Enclosed in my own four walls, I found myself as an immigrant imprisoned in a foreign country;... I saw my family as strange aliens whose foreign customs, rites, and very language defied comprehension;... though I did not want it, they forced me to participate in their bizarre rituals;... I could not resist. [190]
However, James Hawes argues many of Kafka's descriptions of the legal proceedings in Der Process—metaphysical, absurd, bewildering and nightmarish as they might appear—are based on accurate and informed descriptions of German and Austrian criminal proceedings of the time, which were inquisitorial rather than adversarial.[191] Although he worked in insurance, as a trained lawyer Kafka was "keenly aware of the legal debates of his day".[187][192] In an early 21st-century publication that uses Kafka's office writings as its point of departure,[193] Pothik Ghosh states that with Kafka, law "has no meaning outside its fact of being a pure force of domination and determination".[194]
The earliest English translations of Kafka's works were by Edwin and Willa Muir, who in 1930 translated the first German edition of Das Schloss. This was published as The Castle by Secker & Warburg in England and Alfred A. Knopf in the United States.[195] A 1941 edition, including a homage by Thomas Mann, spurred a surge in Kafka's popularity in the United States the late 1940s.[196] The Muirs translated all shorter works that Kafka had seen fit to print; they were published by Schocken Books in 1948 as The Penal Colony: Stories and Short Pieces,[197] including additionally The First Long Train Journey, written by Kafka and Brod, Kafka's "A Novel about Youth", a review of Felix Sternheim's Die Geschichte des jungen Oswald, his essay on Kleist's "Anecdotes", his review of the literary magazine Hyperion, and an epilogue by Brod.
Later editions, notably those of 1954 (Dearest Father. Stories and Other Writings), included text, translated by Eithne Wilkins and Ernst Kaiser,[198] which had been deleted by earlier publishers.[166] Known as "Definitive Editions", they include translations of The Trial, Definitive, The Castle, Definitive, and other writings. These translations are generally accepted to have a number of biases and are considered to be dated in interpretation.[199] Published in 1961 by Schocken Books, Parables and Paradoxes presented in a bilingual edition by Nahum N. Glatzer selected writings,[200] drawn from notebooks, diaries, letters, short fictional works and the novel Der Process.
New translations were completed and published based on the recompiled German text of Pasley and Schillemeit — The Castle, Critical by Mark Harman (Schocken Books, 1998),[164] The Trial, Critical by Breon Mitchell (Schocken Books, 1998),[201] and Amerika: The Man Who Disappeared by Michael Hofmann (New Directions Publishing, 2004).[202]
Kafka often made extensive use of a characteristic particular to the German language allowing for long sentences that sometimes can span an entire page. Kafka's sentences then deliver an unexpected impact just before the full stop—that being the finalizing meaning and focus. This is due to the construction of subordinate clauses in German which require that the verb be positioned at the end of the sentence. Such constructions are difficult to duplicate in English, so it is up to the translator to provide the reader with the same (or at least equivalent) effect found in the original text.[203] German's more flexible word order and syntactical differences provide for multiple ways the same German writing can be translated into English.[204] An example is the first sentence of Kafka's "The Metamorphosis", which is crucial to the setting and understanding of the entire story:[205]
Als Gregor Samsa eines Morgens aus unruhigen Traumen erwachte fand er sich in seinem Bett zu einem ungeheuren Ungeziefer verwandelt. (Original)
As Gregor Samsa one morning from restless dreams awoke, found he himself in his bed into an enormous vermin transformed. (literal word-for-word translation)[206]
Another virtually insurmountable problem facing translators is how to deal with the author's intentional use of ambiguous idioms and words that have several meanings which result in phrasing difficult to precisely translate.[207][208] One such instance is found in the first sentence of "The Metamorphosis". English translators often render the word Ungeziefer as "insect"; in Middle German, however, Ungeziefer literally means "an animal unclean for sacrifice";[209] in today's German it means vermin. It is sometimes used colloquially to mean "bug" —a very general term, unlike the scientific "insect". Kafka had no intention of labeling Gregor, the protagonist of the story, as any specific thing, but instead wanted to convey Gregor's disgust at his transformation.[132][133] Another example is Kafka's use of the German noun Verkehr in the final sentence of "Das Urteil". Literally, Verkehr means intercourse and, as in English, can have either a sexual or non-sexual meaning; in addition, it is used to mean transport or traffic. The sentence can be translated as: "At that moment an unending stream of traffic crossed over the bridge".[210] The double meaning of Verkehr is given added weight by Kafka's confession to Brod that when he wrote that final line, he was thinking of "a violent ejaculation".[130][211]
Kafka's writing has inspired the term "Kafkaesque", used to describe concepts and situations reminiscent of his work, particularly Der Process and "Die Verwandlung". Examples include instances in which bureaucracies overpower people, often in a surreal, nightmarish milieu which evokes feelings of senselessness, disorientation, and helplessness. Characters in a Kafkaesque setting often lack a clear course of action to escape the situation. Kafkaesque elements often appear in existential works, but the term has transcended the literary realm to apply to real-life occurrences and situations that are incomprehensibly complex, bizarre, or illogical.[36][212][213][214]
Numerous films and television works have been described as Kafkaesque, and the style is particularly prominent in dystopian science fiction. Works in this genre that have been thus described include Terry Gilliam's 1985 film Brazil and the 1998 science fiction film noir, Dark City. Films from other genres which have been similarly described include The Tenant (1976) and Barton Fink (1991).[215] The television series The Prisoner is also frequently described as Kafkaesque.[216][217]
The Franz Kafka Museum in Prague is dedicated to Kafka and his work. A major component of the museum is an exhibit The City of K. Franz Kafka and Prague, which was first shown in Barcelona in 1999, moved to the Jewish Museum in New York City, and was finally established in 2005 in Prague in Malá Strana (Lesser Town), along the Moldau. The museum calls its display of original photos and documents Město K. Franz Kafka a Praha (City K. Kafka and Prague) and aims to immerse the visitor into the world in which Kafka lived and about which he wrote.[218]
The Franz Kafka Prize is an annual literary award of the Franz Kafka Society and the City of Prague established in 2001. It recognizes the merits of literature as "humanistic character and contribution to cultural, national, language and religious tolerance, its existential, timeless character, its generally human validity, and its ability to hand over a testimony about our times".[219] The selection committee and recipients come from all over the world, but are limited to living authors who have had at least one work published in the Czech language.[219] The recipient receives $10,000, a diploma, and a bronze statuette at a presentation in Prague's Old Town Hall on the Czech State Holiday in late October.[219]
San Diego State University (SDSU) operates a Kafka Project which began in 1998 as the official international search for Kafka's last writings.[158]
Unlike many famous writers, Kafka is rarely quoted by others. Instead, he is noted more for his visions and perspective.[220] Shimon Sandbank, a professor and writer, identifies Kafka as having influenced Jorge Luis Borges, Albert Camus, Eugène Ionesco, J. M. Coetzee and Jean-Paul Sartre.[221] A Financial Times literary critic credits Kafka with influencing José Saramago,[222] and Al Silverman, a writer and editor, states that J. D. Salinger loved to read Kafka's works.[223] In 1999 a committee of 99 authors, scholars, and literary critics ranked Der Process and Das Schloss the second and ninth most significant German-language novels of the 20th century.[224] Shimon Sandbank, a literary critic, argues that despite Kafka's pervasiveness, his enigmatic style has yet to be emulated.[221] Neil Pages, a professor who specialises in Kafka's works, says Kafka's influence transcends literature and literary scholarship; it impacts visual arts, music, and popular culture.[225] Harry Steinhauer, a professor of German and Jewish literature, says that Kafka "has made a more powerful impact on literate society than any other writer of the twentieth century".[36] Brod said that the 20th century will one day be known as the "century of Kafka".[36]
Michel-André Bossy writes that Kafka created a rigidly inflexible and sterile bureaucratic universe. Kafka wrote in an aloof manner full of legal and scientific terms. Yet his serious universe also had insightful humour, all highlighting the "irrationality at the roots of a supposedly rational world".[177] His characters are trapped, confused, full of guilt, frustrated, and lacking understanding of their surreal world. Much of the post-Kafka fiction, especially science fiction, follow the themes and precepts of Kafka's universe. This can be seen in the works of authors such as George Orwell and Ray Bradbury.[177]
The following are examples of works across a range of literary, musical, and dramatic genres which demonstrate the extent of cultural influence:

=======================================================
Born in Prague in 1883, Franz Kafka is today considered the most important prose writer of the so-called Prague Circle, a loosely knit group of German-Jewish writers who contributed to the culturally fertile soil of Prague during the 1880s until after World War I. Yet from the Czech point of view, Kafka was German, and from the German point of view he was, above all, Jewish. In short, Kafka shared the fate of much of Western Jewry — people who were largely emancipated from their specifically Jewish ways and yet not fully assimilated into the culture of the countries where they lived. Although Kafka became extremely interested in Jewish culture after meeting a troupe of Yiddish actors in 1911, and although he began to study Hebrew shortly after that, it was not until late in his life that he became deeply interested in his heritage. His close relationship with Dora Dymant, his steady and understanding companion of his last years, contributed considerably toward this development. But even if Kafka had not been Jewish, it is hard to see how his artistic and religious sensitivity could have remained untouched by the ancient Jewish traditions of Prague which reached back to the city's tenth-century origin.
In addition to Kafka's German, Czech, and Jewish heritages, there was also the Austrian element into which Kafka had been born and in which he had been brought up. Prague was the major second capital of the Austrian Empire (after Vienna) since the early sixteenth century, and although Kafka was no friend of Austrian politics, it is important to emphasize this Austrian component of life in Prague because Kafka has too often been called a Czech writer — especially in America. Kafka's name is also grouped too often with German writers, which is accurate only in the sense that he belongs to the German-speaking world. Apart from that, however, it is about as meaningful as considering Faulkner an English novelist.
For his recurring theme of human alienation, Kafka is deeply indebted to Prague and his situation there as a social outcast, a victim of the friction between Czechs and Germans, Jews and non-Jews. To understand Kafka, it is important to realize that in Prague the atmosphere of medieval mysticism and Jewish orthodoxy lingered until after World War II, when the Communist regime began getting rid of most of its remnants. To this day, however, Kafka's tiny flat in Alchemists' Lane behind the towering Hradschin Castle is a major attraction for those in search of traces of Kafka. The haunting mood of Prague's narrow, cobblestoned streets, its slanted roofs, and its myriad backyards comes alive in the surreal settings of Kafka's stories. His simple, sober, and yet dense language is traced to the fact that in Prague the German language had been exposed to manifold Slavic influences for centuries and was virtually cut off from the mainstream language as spoken and written in Germany and Austria. Prague was a linguistic island as far as German was concerned, and while the Czech population of Prague doubled within the last two decades of the nineteenth century, the percentage of German Jews sank to a mere seven percent. The result was that Kafka actually wrote in a language which was on the verge of developing its own characteristics. This absence of any gap between the spoken and written word in his language is probably the secret behind the enormous appeal of his language, whose deceptive simplicity comes across in every decent translation.
Kafka's family situation was a reflection of his being a German-speaking Jew in a predominantly Slavic environment. The great socio-economic and educational differences between his father, Hermann Kafka, and his mother, Julie Löwy, were at the root of this complex situation. Kafka's father's whole life was shaped by his desperate and eventually successful attempt to break out of his poor Czech milieu and become accepted in the prestigious environment of German Prague; his mother, however, came from a wealthy German-Jewish bourgeois family. Throughout his lifetime, Franz Kafka could never extricate himself from the terrible friction between his parents, which was caused, for the most part, by his tyrannical father. Kafka's only strong, positive ties with his family were with his favorite sister, Ottla, who let him stay at her home and later helped him break off his relationship with Felice Bauer, his first finance.
To one extent or another, all of Kafka's works bear the unmistakable imprint of the nerve-wracking struggle between his humility and hypersensitivity (his mother's heritage) and the crudity and superficiality of his father, who looked at his son's writing with indifference and, at times, with contempt. This total lack of understanding and the absence of any home life worthy the name (young Franz was virtually brought up by a nurse) caused the boy's early seriousness and anxiety. As late as 1919, five years before his death, this lifelong trauma manifested itself in his Letter to His Father (almost a hundred pages, but never actually delivered), in which Kafka passionately accuses his father of intimidation and brutality. Although it will not do to reduce the complex art of Franz Kafka to its autobiographical elements, the significance of these elements in his work is indeed striking. His story "The Judgment" seems especially to be the direct result of his deep-seated fear of his father.
Kafka is the classical painter of the estrangement of modern man, although he is never its apostle. As early as 1905, in his "Description of a Fight," Kafka already denied man's ability to obtain certainty through sensory perception and intellectual effort because, according to him, these methods inevitably distort the nature of the Absolute by forcing it into their prefabricated structures. The resulting skepticism, of which he himself was to become the tragic victim, was the basis of his conviction that none of our fleeting impressions and accidental associations have a fixed counterpart in a "real" and stable world. There is no clear-cut boundary between reality and the realm of dreams, and if one of his characters appears to have found such a boundary, it quickly turns out that he has set it up merely as something to cling to in the face of chaos. The "real" world of phenomena develops its own logic and leaves Kafka's characters yearning for a firm metaphysical anchor which they never quite grasp.
At no time did Kafka seek refuge from his culturally and socially alienated situation by joining literary or social circles — something many of his fellow writers did. He remained an outcast, suffering from the consequences of his partly self-imposed seclusion, and yet welcoming it for the sake of literary productivity. Anxious although he was to use his positions, as well as his engagements to Felice Bauer and Julie Wohryzek, as a means to gain recognition for his writing, his life story is, nevertheless, one long struggle against his feelings of guilt and inferiority.
The one person who could and did help him was Max Brod, whom he met in 1902, and who was to become not only his editor but also an intimate friend. The numerous letters which Kafka wrote to him are a moving testimony of their mutual appreciation. Because of Brod's encouragement, Kafka began to read his first literary efforts to small private audiences long before he was recognized as a significant writer. With Brod, Kafka traveled to Italy, Weimar (where Goethe and Schiller had written), and Paris; later, Brod introduced him into the literary circles of Prague. In short, Brod helped Kafka to fend off an increasingly threatening self-isolation. Most significantly for posterity, it was Brod who, contrary to Kafka's express request, did not burn the manuscripts which Kafka left behind; instead, he became their enthusiastic editor.
If Kafka had a strong inclination to isolate himself, this does not mean he was indifferent to what was going on around him. Especially in the years until 1912, Kafka familiarized himself with some of the far-reaching new ideas of the day. At a friend's house, he attended lectures and discussions on Einstein's theory of relativity, Planck's quantum theory, and Freud's psychoanalytical experiments. He was also interested in politics, especially the nationalistic aspirations of the Czechs in the Austrian Empire. In his function as a lawyer at the Workers' Insurance Company, he was confronted daily with the social situation of workers, and toward the end of World War I, he even composed a brochure on the plight of the proletariat. This is, in part, proof that Franz Kafka was not the melancholy dreamer of nightmares, isolated in his ivory tower in Prague — a view still commonly held today.
It was at Max Brod's home that Kafka met Felice Bauer in 1912. This encounter plunged him into a frustrating relationship for many years, oscillating between engagements and periods of complete withdrawal. "The Judgment" (1912) is a document of this encounter. Having literally poured the story out in one long sitting, Kafka came to regard it as an illustration of how one should always write; it was the subject of his first public reading. At that time, Kafka was already filling a detailed diary, full of reflections and parables as a means of self-analysis. The same year, 1912, he wrote "The Metamorphosis," one of the most haunting treatments of human alienation, and most of the fragmentary novel Amerika. According to his own conviction, his literary productivity reached a peak at precisely the time when his insecurity and anxiety over whether or not to marry Felice reached a climax. For the first time, the deep-seated conflict between his yearning for the simple life of a married man and his determination not to succumb to it became critical.
More and more, Kafka's writing began to deal with Angst (anxiety, anguish), probably because of the sustained anxiety induced by his domineering father and by the problem of whether or not to break away from his bachelorhood existence. Toward the end of "The Judgment," and in "In the Penal Colony," as well as in The Trial and The Castle, the father figure assumes the mysterious qualities of an ineffable god. Suffering, punishment, judgment, trial — all these are manifestations of Kafka's rigorous, ethical mind. The philosophy of Franz Brentano, to which he was exposed at the university, intensified his interest in these themes. The essence of this philosophy is that since emotions and concepts cannot sufficiently explain moral action, personal judgment alone must determine it; thorough self-analysis is the only prerequisite for such a total autonomy of personal judgment, a view which Kafka came to exercise almost to the point of self-destruction.
Kafka's fascination with these themes received new impetus when he began to read the Danish philosopher Sören Kierkegaard in 1913. As radical a skeptic as Kafka and equally religious by temperament, Kierkegaard envisages man as caught in the dilemma of wanting to comprehend Divinity with the altogether inadequate tools of rationality. Since God's transcendence is absolute for him, Kierkegaard sees no way of solving this dilemma except by abandoning intellectual pursuit and venturing a "leap into faith." Kafka's plea for man to "enter into the law," stated most explicitly in the parable "Before the Law" (in The Trial), deals with this dilemma. The difference is that Kierkegaard is cornered by the overwhelming presence of God forcing him to make decisions. In Kafka's parable, his hero wants to enter the first gate of the palace — that is, "the law" — but he dies because he does not exert sufficient will to enter and leaves all possible decisions to the gatekeeper; Kafka's searching man has no divine guidance to show him the way, and the situation he faces is one of total uncertainty and despair. Antithetically, Kierkegaard's radical skepticism results in faith.
Kafka and Kierkegaard have been called existentialists, and though this label has some merits, it should nevertheless be used very carefully. Both men were fascinated by the theme of moral integrity in the face of freedom of choice and were convinced that humans live meaningfully only to the extent which they realize themselves. In this connection, it is interesting to know that Kafka felt close to Kierkegaard because of the latter's lifelong unresolved relationship to his fiancée. The problem dominated Kierkegaard's life and work as much as Kafka's life and work was dominated by his relationships with Felice Bauer (to whom he was engaged twice — in 1914 and 1917), Julie Wohryzek (engaged in 1919), and Milena Jesenská (1920-22).
Perhaps more than any other story, Kafka's "In the Penal Colony" (1914) reflects his reaction to the outbreak of World War I, a feeling of sheer horror as well as disgust with the politicians in power. The result was a renewed fascination with Schopenhauer and Dostoevsky, whose extolment of physical pain finds expression in a variety of ways. Near this same time, Kafka began working on The Trial, about which he remarked that its ghastly thoughts devoured him in much the same way as did his thoughts about Felice. The novel is an elaborate and heavily autobiographical fantasy of punishment: on the eve of his thirty-first birthday, Joseph K. is executed; on the evening of his own thirty-first birthday, Kafka decided to travel to Berlin to break off his first engagement with Felice. Symptomatically for Kafka, this novel remained fragmentary — as did his other two, Amerika and The Castle. "A Report to an Academy" and the fragmentary "The Hunter Gracchus" followed, and, in 1919, several stories were published under the title A Country Doctor. The title story is a symbolic description of modern man living outside a binding universal order and brought to death by sensuality and the aimlessness of the forces working within him. This volume contains perhaps Kafka's best parable on the nature of absurdity, "The Imperial Message." It is a terrifying description of how important messages, ordered at the top level to save men at the bottom, never stand a chance of getting through the manifold obstacles of bureaucracy. "The Imperial Message" is an interesting reversal of "Before the Law," where the lowly searcher never even gets beyond the first gate (the lowest obstacle) in his attempt to proceed to higher insights. In both cases, the human need to communicate is frustrated, and the inevitable result is alienation and subsequent death.
These stories were written during a time when Kafka, engaged once again to Felice, was finding a measure of stability again. Although he was determined this time to give up his insurance position and to use his time writing, he soon realized that this effort was an escape, as had been his (rejected) application to be drafted into the army. Kafka was to remain much like the roving hunter Gracchus, burdened with the knowledge that he could not gain inner poise by drowning the fundamental questions of existence in the comforts of married life.
In 1917, Kafka was stricken with tuberculosis, an illness which he was convinced was only the physical manifestation of his disturbed inner condition. For years he had fought hopeless battles for and against marriage (he had a son with Grete Bloch, a friend of Felice's, but never knew about him); during this time, he continually sought to justify his suffering by writing. Now he gave up. "The world — Felice is its representative — and my innermost self have torn apart my body in unresolvable opposition," he wrote in his diary. His suffering was alleviated by the fact that he could spend many months in the country, either in sanatoriums or with his favorite sister, Ottla. These months brought with them a new freedom from his work as a lawyer and, for the second time, from Felice.
In 1922, Kafka wrote "A Hunger Artist," "Investigations of a Dog," and most of his third novel, The Castle. Highly autobiographical like all of his works, the hero of "A Hunger Artist" starves himself because he cannot find the spiritual food he requires. The investigations of the chief dog in the story of the same name reflect Kafka's own literary attempts to impart at least a notion of the universal to his readers. In The Castle, K. becomes entangled in the snares of a castle's "celestial" hierarchy as hopelessly as does Joseph K. in the "terrestrial" bureaucracy of The Trial. All these stories originated in the years 1921 and 1922, years when Kafka lived under the strong influence of Milena Jesenská, to whom he owed his renewed strength to write. Although in many respects different from him (she was gentile, unhappily married, and much younger), the extremely sensitive Milena could justly claim "to have known his anxiety before having known Kafka himself," as she put it. Forever afraid of any deeper involvement with Milena, Kafka eventually stopped seeing her. That he gave her his diaries and several manuscripts, however, is proof of his deep commitment to her.
=======================================================
Kafka's biography reads almost like a critical analysis of his work, for so much of the neurotic tension of his writing finds its clear origin in the events of his life. Franz Kafka was born on July 3, 1883 in the Jewish ghetto of Prague. He was an outsider from the start. Prague's Jews were doubly outsiders because they spoke German-the official language of the Hapsburg Empire-in a Czech city, yet they were neither Germans nor Czechs. Moreover, as an "assimilated" non-believer, Kafka was an outsider even in the Jewish community. Later in life he would learn Hebrew and dream of going to Palestine, but he never fully accepted Judaism, and though he seemed to remain religious, his beliefs lay clearly outside any charted tradition.
Kafka's ambivalent take on authority-his ability to respect it, rebel against it, and blame himself for everything-seems to come mainly from his relationship with his father. Hermann Kafka, a self-made storekeeper, had a gigantic build and a brash character, opposed to Franz's smaller body and milder, highly intellectual, personality. Though he was very energetic and, according to his friends, smooth and charming, Kafka never managed to emerge out of his father's shadow and escape his self-hatred. Later in life he undertook a variety of health regiments and diets in an attempt to boost his physique.Always haunted by feelings of inferiority to his father, Kafka also faced his father's disapproval of his writing, which the latter considered to be a waste of time, never hesitating to point out to his son that he thought him a disappointment. Partly under his father's influence and partly because he did not believe in making a profession out of writing, Kafka took a law degree and became a clerk for an accident insurance office. The office job provided Kafka with an income and some self-confidence, and he was responsible for a number of policy changes that saved the lives of many workers. He continued writing in the evenings while living with his parents and three sisters, learning to place himself in a writing trance to block out the noise.Much of Kafka's early writing is lost, but 1912 proved to be a breakthrough year for him as he wrote some of his most important stories, including "The Judgment," "The Metamorphosis," and much of his novel Amerika. This was also the year when Kafka met Felice Bauer, to whom he was engaged (and disengaged) twice over the next five years in a storm of letters with extremely little physical interaction. His belief in the importance of marriage coupled with the need to get away from his father's influence was in perpetual conflict with his strong fear of matrimony. In the next year Kafka traveled to Vienna and Venice, and began a brief relationship with Grete Bloch, whose son by him Kafka never knew about and who died while still a child. Soon after, Kafka began work on The Trial (1914), his most famous novel and, though unfinished, the only one with a written ending.After moving to several apartments in the next few years to get away from the noise of his parents' home and to escape his father's influence, Kafka finally broke off his engagement to Felice Bauer. Around that time he began coughing blood and was diagnosed with tuberculosis. To get away from everything and recover from his sickness, Kafka moved out to his sister Ottla's farm away from Prague. He dreamed aimlessly of becoming a potato farmer or of moving to Palestine, but soon returned to Prague.Freed partly from his father's influence, Kafka wrote the "Latter to His Father" (1919), carefully cataloguing every aspect of his view of their relationship. The letter is a masterpiece, shedding light on every novel and story he had written in which a protagonist struggled with a superior power. The letter, which he gave to his mother to pass on, never reached its addressee. Another important relationship-by-letter, this time with Milena Jesenska, ended within two years despite Kafka's apparent love.It was then that Kafka wrote The Castle (1922), now recasting power in the form of benign indifference, as well as his story "The Hunger Artist," a brilliant exposition of the artistic drive. But this was also the year that, after years of time spent in sanatoriums on medical leave, Kafka finally had to leave his job at the insurance office as a result of his illness. Soon feeling healthier, he met Dora Dymant and actually moved to Berlin with her, for the first time in his life living with a woman he wasn't related to and finding his independence. But their dreams of moving to Tel Aviv together were covered over by the black cloak of futility, as Kafka's tuberculosis grew worse, forcing him to return to Prague for treatment. Stripped of his new love and freedom, he died in 1924.Never famous in his own lifetime, Kafka did have an audience of admirers within a small circle of German-reading intellectuals. Many of his stories were published during his lifetime, but many were not. His three novels, all unfinished, were left in disarray among his manuscripts, with chapters out of order and titles missing; their rough unfinished quality seems only to add to the stunning nervous confusion of his style. Kafka had famously asked his long-time friend, Max Brod, to burn most of these manuscripts after his death and Brod, equally famously, ignored the request and set out to edit this incredible collection for publication. Kafka, who never in his life had confidence on a par with his talent, at last became recognized as one of the most interesting writers of the modern era, his legacy standing in opposition to the words he had once written of himself:"A picture of my existence... would show a useless wooden stake covered in snow... stuck loosely at a slant in the ground in a ploughed field on the edge of a vast open plain on a dark winter night." 
=======================================================
 Franz Kafka was born into the flux of social discord and bureaucratic dead weight that was otherwise known as Prague. With both God and father wielding hammers above his head, Kafka came of age in a city which had, under the assault of the modern world, ceased to make any sense. It was a city that had lost its own cultural identity. Burdened with administrating an empire whose lifeblood circulated in reams of paper, the crushing weight of bureaucracy belied a maze of crooked byways and dark coffeehouses, thrumming with the clash of volatile ethnicities. The contrast between the two worlds threatened with every step to cross the quiet line into absurdity. As if he had no choice, as if the metropolis clung to him madly, Kafka took it all in, made it his own, and found that he could never leave for long. He hovered around Prague all his life, and just as Joyce did with Dublin, just as Thoreau did with Concord, Kafka took his city and built for it a mythology of stories, constructed as meticulously and haphazardly as a filing cabinet of administrative documents. In the works of Franz Kafka, Prague is every city touched by brutal industrial efficiency, where humans slip quietly into the fatal gears of a vast, unreal machinery. But if Kafkas collected works form a private dream portrait of Prague, they also reveal a portrait of the dreamer, struggling to write his internal world into being  a mythic world, where every man working silently at an overburdened desk is stripped of identity, where the conflict between fathers and sons is enacted in Eden, and where the act of writing possesses the beautiful terror of birth. To better understand this world, we must look at the landscapes absorbed by Kafkas creative imagination, from the dynamics of culture, community, and family to the cramped stairways over which he scurried.
Hermann Kafka grew up in Wossek, a tightly-knit Jewish village roughly 50 miles south of Prague. His own father, Jakob, was the ritual butcher of the town. It was a profession which forced the family to squeak out a living, and they were unable to afford any of the luxuries that Franz would eventually enjoy. By the time Hermann was old enough to help pull a cart, he was put to work, delivering kosher meat across long distances and often in poor weather.
Perhaps as a result of this excruciating lifestyle, Hermann grew up to be a strong child  and from an early age, he knew that he wanted something better out of life. He left home at the age of fourteen, joined the army at nineteen, and in 1882, when he was thirty, he moved to the city of Prague to test his fortune. Eventually, he formed a business partnership and opened a fancy-goods shop. Shortly afterwards, he met and married the 26-year-old Julie Löwy, the daughter of a successful brewer. Impressed with Hermanns ambitious personality and well-built physique, Julie understood the value of hard work, and held fairly conservative attitudes regarding her role as wife. She devoted herself to her husband, keeping busy in the shop most of the day and playing cards with him during the evening. When Franz was born on July 3, 1883, he was left in the care of a nurse while Julie went back to work.
At the time of Franzs birth, Prague was one of the largest cities in the slowly crumbling empire of Austria. In 1867 a compromise had been made between Austrias Germans and Hungarys Magyars, creating a Dual Monarchy divided by the Leith River. On the east side of the river was the Kingdom of Hungary, on the west the Empire of Austria. Austria was generally governed as a German nation-state, effectively alienating the large minorities which existed within its borders, including the Czechs, who were particularly angered by their exclusion. Nationalist movements arose which placed the Czech population into direct conflict with the German population. The law favored the Germans, the Czechs felt offended, and the Jews were caught somewhere in the middle.
In order to have any social mobility, a Jewish family was forced to learn German, which earned them the enmity of the Czechs. Not that this gained them much favor with the Germans, who always considered the Jews outsiders  at best. On account of this unenviable position, the Jewish community became the scapegoat for the frustrations of all the surrounding peoples. While Franz would learn German as his first language, Hermann navigated these dangerous waters by knowing both languages  the Czech of his youth, and the German of the bourgeois class. (The name Kafka itself is a Czech word with a Germanized spelling: kavka is Czech for jackdaw, a bird related to ravens, rooks, and crows.) Hermanns fluency in Czech helped him gain more customers, and allowed for clearer communications with his Slavic employees  to whom he privately referred as his paid enemies. On one occasion, when a riot destroyed many Jewish businesses, the mob left Hermanns shop alone. He spoke Czech, and was therefore one of them.
Because Hermanns dreams of a robust income kept him focused on his trade, Franz was often left in the care of a governess, as was common practice for the middle class. By the time he was six, two younger brothers had died in infancy, and the family had moved five times. These experiences no doubt left the young child with a sense of instability, but the family continued to grow. By 1892, Franz had three sisters  Gabriele, Valerie, and Ottilie (nicknamed Elli, Valli, and Ottla). It was this family that he would rely on for the entirety of his life.
Kafkas deep sense of need, both financial and emotional, was often complicated by feelings of hatred  or at the very least, by the desire to escape. Indeed, most of his feelings towards his family were mixed and contradictory, and this conflict took root deep within his psyche, emerging in unexpected ways throughout his life. His father, who could certainly be overwhelming, held young Franz to higher standards than he set for himself; as a result, his sons feelings of love and awe were tangled up with the profound sense of being a disappointment. Because his mother often took his fathers side over his, the affection he had for her was tempered by the rancor of an abandoned child. The one person in the family with whom he truly connected was his youngest sister Ottla, who was free-spirited and rebellious. He would later compare his relationship with Ottla to a conspiracy against their autocratic father.
Eventually, Franz enrolled in the German National and Civic Elementary School. Although he hated going to school  often needing to be dragged there by the family cook  he was a model student. After four years in the elementary school, he was admitted to the famously strict German National Humanistic Gymnasium, which represented the American equivalent of grades five through twelve. Like most schools of its time, it was designed more for indoctrination than education, as petty and unimaginative as it was pointlessly rigid. As a whole, the institution placed a tremendous focus on memorization, so much so that one of its teachers asserted that eight hours of Latin grammar each week was simply not enough. Greek was also memorized, with little discussion of content or context. One teacher introduced his students to Goethe, insisting that they model their sentences on those of the famous German writer  the idea of actually exploring what those sentences meant was naturally out of the question. And always, there was the threat of exams.
The consistent pressure transformed Kafka into a nervous wreck. After one particularly trying exam period, he succumbed to physical exhaustion, and was forced to take a long vacation to recover. Despite the fact that he performed well, he believed himself to be the dumbest student in the class, and was in constant fear of having his stupidity unmasked. He imagined that every examination would result in a tremendous failure; but in spite of this pessimism (or maybe because of it), he always passed, and sometimes even excelled. If anything, the Gymnasium taught him how to succeed despite tedium and strict regimentation, and he learned how to get by in places where hed rather not be.
When it came time for his bar mitzvah, the thirteen-year old Kafka approached it as just another task of memorization. His father, raised in a village defined by its Judaism, had always demanded that Franz be devout; but at the same time rarely went to synagogue himself. Religion, for Hermann, had always been a matter of concrete reality. If society saw him as a good person, then he could consider himself reasonably devout, and there was no reason to bother with those Jewish practices that made him stick out too much. Franz, having not grown up in a world where religion and life were inextricably bound, held a different view. Religion was something separate from reality, and if the rules of heaven were ever applied to earth, they would have to be followed painfully to the letter, as if one were balancing an equation. Naturally, Kafka saw his fathers ambivalence toward the synagogue as a grave hypocrisy, and from early on, he considered himself a religious skeptic. He argued with friends over the existence of God, and soon became interested in Spinoza, Nietzsche, and Darwin.
Kafka finished his studies at the Gymnasium in July 1901. In order to get into a university, he had to take the Abitur exams. Naturally, he didnt expect to pass; naturally, he did. By November, he was registered at the German University in Prague. But once he was there, Kafka wasnt sure what to do with himself. At first, he followed his friend Hugo Bergmann into studying chemistry, but he wasnt very good at it, so he switched to law. It wasnt that Kafka particularly enjoyed the subject  he compared his studies to living on chewed-up sawdust  but law offered a wide range of career possibilities; and as an added bonus, the longer period of study it required allowed him to stall for time. Whenever he could, he took classes in the humanities to break up the boredom. He also attended  lectures sponsored by the Hall, a primarily Jewish student union of budding intellectuals and politicians.
There had always been a creative bent to Kafka. A voracious reader, he had known from early childhood that he wanted to be a writer. Around the age of fourteen, he wrote plays for his sisters to perform at his parents birthday parties, and in 1899 he began to experiment with fiction. But writing was no way to make a living, and his father would never approve of such an impractical career choice. Furthermore, it didnt appear that Kafka even liked anything he wrote. The only work from this period which escaped destruction is a story called Tale of Shamefaced Lanky and Impure in Heart, which survived only because it was included in a letter to his friend Oskar Pollak.
In 1904, Kafka began to work on a novel entitled The Child and the City, but the project was abandoned and the manuscripts lost. Pulling together again, he started Description of a Struggle, a piece he would revisit time and time again over the next five years.  Kafkas earliest surviving work of substance, it clearly reveals traces of his otherworldly and somewhat morbid imagination. Unfortunately, the story lacks the coherence needed to make its symbolism effective, and its characters and setting perform unbelievable gymnastics in the middle of an already murky plot. Realizing that he had problems with his narrative, Kafka saved portions of the story, some of which he would revise for his first publication in 1908. But for now, there seemed to be some hope for this writing thing; though not enough to dissuade him from his present course. After a brief and unproductive diversion into philosophy, he continued studying law. Then, in 1905, he showed Description of a Struggle to his friend, Max Brod.
Kafka had first met Max Brod in October 1902. A year younger than Kafka, Brod was in many ways his complete opposite. Delicate and slightly deformed, he was nevertheless something of a ladies man, and radiated constant enthusiasm and boundless energy. Even as a teenager, Brod was a true polymath, and considered himself a writer, a poet, a critic, and a musician. A dynamic member of the Halls culture committee, he first encountered Kafka after a lecture Brod was giving on Schopenhauer. After dismissing Nietzsche as a fraud, the young lecturer found himself in a debate with an audience member who had quite different ideas. It was the beginning of a friendship that would last for the rest of Kafkas short life.
Although it took Kafka two years until he finally showed Brod his own work, upon reading Description of a Struggle, he quickly recognized that Kafka was gifted with the spark of genius. Bringing his tireless energy to bear on his friend, Brod constantly prodded Kafka to keep writing, to stop destroying his manuscripts, and to get his work published.
It would be impossible to underestimate the importance of Max Brod in relation to Kafkas place in literature. After Kafkas death, it was Max Brod who gathered up everything Kafka had ever written, taking on the difficult role of editor and publisher. It was Max Brod who made sure his friends work survived the Nazi flames. Without Brods faith and perseverance, Franz Kafka may very well have vanished into obscurity, no more famous today than his friends Oskar Pollak, Franz Werfel, Felix Weltsch  or Max Brod.
It is a self-evident and famous irony: although Brod was a more prolific and much better known writer at the time, history remembers him primarily as Franz Kafkas biographer and literary executor.
Kafkas years as a university student saw him inaugurate more than his writing career  it was during these years that he began his lifelong ambiguous relationship with sex. In 1903, he lost his virginity to a Czech shopgirl; a rather common scenario, the shopgirl being one of many who earned a little extra through a form of unprofessional prostitution. After this, Kafka uneasily took up the habit of going to brothels, a usual preoccupation with university students at the time. There were a few more shopgirls and waitresses, and in 1905 he had an affair with an older woman while on vacation in Switzerland; although the exact level of intimacy in the affair is unknown.
As one might expect from Kafka, his sexual encounters brought  conflicting emotions  the ambivalence of excitement and guilt. Sex both compelled and disgusted Kafka. He was attracted to it, because  well, because he wasnt dead; but the physicality of the act disturbed him. He couldnt stand bodily functions, yet the body itself had undeniably attractive qualities. It was a crisis he would never resolve, and his various relationships all brought their share of confused impulses, frustrated desires, and sexual dissatisfactions. This conflict would find its way into his writing, and one can easily identify erotically disturbed mumbles in nearly all his work.
Still, there is a tendency to over-romanticize the bleakness of Kafkas early years, especially these first sexual encounters. While certainly neurotic, overly sensitive, and occasionally given to self-loathing, Kafka was not quite the basket case that he makes himself out to be in his own reflections. Most of his friends considered him a healthy, good-looking man of uncommon intelligence, and he even admitted to being happy after his experience with the shopgirl. Although Kafkas writing is starkly pessimistic, Brod contends that he was actually an easy person to get along with, if a bit on the quiet side, and undoubtedly obsessed with a search for purity. While Brod perceived a tremendous sorrow lurking beneath the surface of Kafkas sardonic smile, he preferred to speak of Kafkas wonderful sense of humor, his truthfulness, his ability to say many things in few words, and most of all, his fascination with the greatness of nature, the curative, health-giving, sound, firmly established, simple things.
In 1906, Kafka finished his exams and became an official Doctor of the Law. After a mandatory year of unpaid work for the courts, Dr. Franz Kafka took a job at the Assicurazioni Generali, an aggressive Italian insurance company. With its meager salary, soul-crushing regulations, and thankless overtime, it was probably the worst possible place for Kafka to work, and he made his escape within a year. Calling upon the help of an old friend, he secured a job at the Workers Accident Insurance Institute, an organization run in part by the Austrian government.
Even though Kafka didnt exactly enjoy his job, he was a good worker, and felt a genuine degree of sympathy for the people he represented. He often secretly took their side over the companys, sometimes giving them tips on how to get a larger settlement. He wrote a number of reports for the Institute, which gave him the opportunity to fine-tune his prose, and his unique style occasionally peeks through even these otherwise bland compositions. Despite the fact that bureaucracy is often parodied in Kafkas work, he was well-liked by his superiors and co-workers, and he had a good degree of responsibility. His competency was rewarded, and he earned several promotions and raises during the course of his career. He was also granted a remarkable leniency towards the number of sick leaves he required, which grew more frequent until he retired two years before his death.
His new job afforded him the time to write, and in 1908, he was published for the first time: eight short pieces compiled under the title Meditation, appearing in Hyperion, a bimonthly magazine edited by Brods associate, Franz Blei. In 1910, five additional pieces, including excerpts from Description of a Struggle, were published in Bohemia. Because of their vague, impressionistic nature, they earned him a comparison to Robert Walser. Fragments of thought and images, the pieces center on a bleak city, where characters wander around streetcars or stand immobile in elevators, thinking about escape. Now and then America shows up unexpectedly as a place of strength and infinite release.
To assess his mood from these pieces, it seemed that Kafka wanted to get away, possibly to anywhere  but the only place he escaped to was his writing, which was rapidly becoming both a solace and a need. Unfortunately, the ideas were not always there when he wanted them, and he still had problems finishing what he started. During a dry spell, he took up a diary to keep in practice; but the drought continued, and Kafka simply could not bring any work to completion. In 1911, Brod convinced him to collaborate on a novel entitled Richard and Samuel, a parody in which they could poke fun at each other, Richard sharing some of Kafkas traits and Samuel some of Brods. That work, too, was eventually abandoned; but still Kafka forged on. He took up the habit of working in the day and writing at night, struggling to create something he felt worthy of saving.
In October, Brod took Kafka to a performance of the Yiddish theater. Although he had largely ignored a similar production a year earlier, this time the performance struck a chord. It completely absorbed him: somewhere in the over-the-top antics of the plays, he found an example of Jewish culture that superseded Zionism or abstract Judaism. Here was an example of Jewish culture as it was lived, a folk culture, one which permitted artistic expression and was at the same time religious. He wrote in an October 4, 1911 diary entry:
If I wanted to explain them [a couple who performed with the troupe] to someone to whom I didnt want to confess my ignorance, I should find that I consider them sextons, employees of the temple, notorious lazybones with whom the community has come to terms, . . . people who, precisely as a result of their being set apart, are very close to the center of the communitys life . . . people who are Jews in an especially pure form because they live only in the religion, but live in it without effort, understanding, or distress.
Kafka became good friends with one of its actors, Jischak Löwy, and developed an infatuation with an actress, Mania Tschissik  who was incidentally a married woman. His father disapproved of his friendship with Löwy; true to his small-town upbringing, he looked down on actors as being little more than wandering vagabonds. At one point Hermann compared Löwy to a dog, but this wouldnt stop Kafka  and after all, his father looked down upon all of his friends. Kafka had discovered a vibrant religious creativity, and he wasnt about to let it go.
Kafka brought in the new year with biographical sketches of Löwy, studies of the Yiddish theater, and pieces on Judaism. At the same time, he continued to explore themes of escape and refuge, working on a novel named The Man Who Disappeared, a work-in-progress which he frequently called his American novel. (Brod would later changed its title from Der Verschollene to Amerika.) It tells the tale of a young man named Karl Rossmann, who is hustled away to New York after impregnating the hired help. Karl spends the rest of the novel wandering, looking for a place to settle down. Of course, nothing ever works out for Karl, and the unfinished novels last scene finds him traveling to the West in hope of finding a home. If we allow ourselves to view Karl Rossmann as a projection of Kafka, we might see Kafka, through Amerika, slowly convincing himself that his dreams of flight would have to remain in his head  reality doesnt take kindly to vague, gigantic plans. If he ever wanted a place where he could feel comfortable, a place to rest, a home, he would have to find it in his surroundings.
In August of that year, Kafka met Felice Bauer at a the home of Max Brod. An executive officer for a dictaphone company, Felice was a rather stoic and capable young woman from Berlin. After a little bit of friendly talk, they half-jokingly discussed taking a trip to Palestine together. They began exchanging letters, and soon he was obsessed, flooding Felice with streams of letters and growing unbearably anxious if she didnt respond quickly enough. At the same time, he didnt really care to meet her again in person, preferring to carry out the entire relationship in words. It would prove to be a telling beginning to a torturous five-year affair.
Whether it was the Yiddish theater, the beginnings of Amerika, meeting Felice Bauer, or an event unrecorded and forgotten, something sparked Kafkas imagination and fired his creative energies. On the night of September 22nd, 1912, he spent eight uninterrupted hours writing his first major story, The Judgment. The suddenness of its creation came as a revelation; he even compared it to giving birth. Only in this way, he wrote in his diary afterwards, can writing be done, only with such coherence, with such a complete opening out of the body and the soul. The piece marked a creative turning point. He had written a story which he could read with profound interest even a year after completing it.
In The Judgment, the protagonist, who is about to get married, runs into problems with his father, who is resentful for having lost control of the family business to his son. Just when the son is poised to inherit the fathers mantle, he is rebuked, and ordered to drown himself  which he does, lovingly. Although reading the story as autobiography would be unwise, it did provide Kafka with a chance to express the despair and bitterness he was feeling at the time. His father had recently gone into the asbestos business with his brother-in-law, and Hermann had been looking more and more to Franz to help oversee the factory. Not only did this absorb much of Kafkas free time  he still held his job at the Institute  but he loathed the place itself, and soon his father began blaming him when the business began losing money. After Brod informed Kafkas mother that her son had been entertaining notions of suicide, Julie quietly intervened, and Kafkas workload was diminished  but his enmity towards his father only increased.
In November, Kafka began The Metamorphosis. Written in a deadpan style that is neither allegory nor exactly fantasy, The Metamorphosis features the traveling salesman Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into a giant bug. Discovering that his family has some trouble handling this new lifestyle, Gregor spends his time variously lost in thought, fretting about his existence, or feeling guilty about the burden he places on his family. Even though Kafka consistently disparaged his story with comments like, I am now reading The Metamorphosis and find it bad, and Unreadable ending. Imperfect almost to its very marrow, it is now regarded as a cornerstone in the foundation of modern literature.
Both The Judgment and The Metamorphosis certainly reflect Kafkas recent experiences. Their characters perform the exaggerated gestures of an overdramatic play. Small religious references reveal wavering opinions about Christianity and Judaism  crosses and apples abound. There is a constant struggle with family, religion, and the workplace. The possibility  or threat  of marriage looms. The stories may be read as representative of the tensions between the business and artistic lifetsyles: could Bendemanns friend in Russia represent Kafka as writer? Could Samsa the bug be the artist who had always been disguised? Although there are many ways to read these stories, its impossible to come to any definite conclusions  and neither did Kafka, who resisted simplistic interpretations. All that is certain is that Kafka took elements from his life, compacted them, and cast them into a prose style that is now recognized across the world.
After this inspired flurry, Kafkas literary productivity dropped dramatically, though both The Judgment and The Stoker (the first chapter of Amerika) were published to some local acclaim. For a while, he considered publishing all three works under the  revealing title of The Sons, but his publisher quietly let the matter  drop  after all, Kafka was a relatively unknown and eccentric writer.
In 1913, he twice visited Felice Bauer in Berlin; but fidelity was not in his nature  in September he had a tryst with a Swiss girl, and in November he met one of Felices friends, Grete Bloch. In April 1914, Franz and Felice became engaged; which didnt stop him from carrying on an intimate correspondence with Grete. His engagement to Felice didnt last long, and it was broken off in July of that year.
On an interesting side note, after Kafkas death, Bloch claimed that she became pregnant by him in the summer of 1914, bearing him a son who died at the age of six  all without Kafka ever finding out. Such claims, however, have come under attack by a number of biographers, and Blochs assertions are, at best, shaky. 
Although his broken engagement with Felice was the first, it would hardly be the last. Kafka looked upon marriage as an ideal situation, something that would complete him as a human being. Realistically, however, he knew a wife would take up the time he sorely needed for writing, which he increasingly looked upon as his salvation. It is a problem that he often pondered  reasons for and against marriage are scattered throughout his diaries, sometimes even in the form of lists indexing the pros and cons. In the absence of an immediate solution, he took up the twin habits of evasion and stalling. This allowed him to dream about the possibility of marriage, while still remaining a writer in practice. He could promise engagements as much as he liked, and never have to bring his fiancée a single, absolute, sincere, I do.
What 1914 did bring was World War I. On June 28, a Bosnian revolutionary assassinated the Archduke Francis Ferdinand, next in line to become emperor of Austria. The alliances and rivalries built up over the past decades came to a catastrophic head, and suddenly Europe was pitted against itself.
Kafka, on the whole, wasnt that concerned; or if he was, he made a special effort to take an ironic viewpoint. His August 2 diary entry reads, Germany has declared war on Russia  Swimming in the afternoon. Because of his work with the government, he was exempted from military service; but a few of his relatives werent so lucky. When his brother-in-law returned in November, Kafka heard first-hand stories of trench warfare. Shortly thereafter, he wrote In the Penal Colony, a brutal story revolving around a complicated but efficient machine of terrifying violence. It is a work particularly suited for wartime, complete with nightmarish imagery to shock the reader and slapstick humor to stave off total desperation.
Writing this nightmarish novella helped nudge Kafka back into a more productive pattern, and he was soon spending his nights writing again. He began working on another novel, and although he would not complete it, much of The Trial was created during this period, including its beginning, its ending, and most of the sections in between.
The Trial begins with its main character, Joseph K., waking up one morning to find himself arrested by a mysterious Court. In an attempt to exonerate himself, he fights his way through a labyrinthine bureaucratic system, in part a parody of Kafkas own insurance company. Despite its incompleteness, the novel is regarded by many to be his greatest work, and a particular passage, Before the Law, must only be talked about in hushed tones. A parable mixing Jewish and Chinese fables with Christian themes, the passage feels decidedly ancient in manner, yet quite modern in philosophy.
Before the Law was another breakthrough for Kafka, whose style soon became implanted with elements of mythology and re-tooled folk tales. This technique enabled his stories to take on the authority of history without revealing an exact meaning. It also allowed him to explore more casual manipulations of space and time, giving some stories the aspect of fairy tales, as his two main works of 1916 clearly demonstrate. In The Hunter Gracchus, it seems perfectly natural that a talking corpse should float into town; while the magical horses of A Country Doctor speed up and slow down depending on Kafkas particular needs.
Although 1917 progressed much like the previous few years  continuous writing, the study of Hebrew, and a second engagement to Felice  in August, Kafka began coughing up blood. On September 4 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He obtained three weeks sick leave and moved in with his sister Ottla in Zürau, a country town about sixty miles northwest of Prague.
Something of a hypochondriac, Kafka had always been obsessed with his uncertain health. He took many of his vacations as rest cures at sanatoriums, regardless of whether or not he needed any specific treatment. Expressing a cautious disdain for traditional medicine, he attached himself to the contemporary fad of nature cures; although he seemed to appreciate their positive orientation more than their actual effectiveness. He didnt drink, he was a vegetarian for long stretches of time, he had an intolerance for noise, and he enjoyed fresh air nearly to the point of recklessness, leaving his windows open for the entire year and refusing to wear heavy clothing in winter. In spite of the meticulous attention paid to his body, his care was frequently offset by sleepless nights, devoted to writing or consumed by insomnia. In short, while his body was in generally sound condition, he was undone by some unknowable combination of unfortunate genes, eccentric habits, and simple bad luck. Using his health as an excuse, he broke off his engagement from Felice for the second time. (She got over it, marrying a little over a year later.) He also took an increasing number of sick leaves.
In 1918 he returned to his job at the Institute, continued his study of Hebrew, and took up gardening for the sake of its hard work; but he was smitten with the Spanish flu and forced to take another leave. That November, at a Schelesen boarding house for tuberculosis patients, he met Julie Wohryzek, a shy dressmaker from Prague. Finding her similar in personality to Grete Bloch, Kafka was pleased by her honesty and doting attention, and the two drifted into a romantic relationship. In a surprising about-face, he proposed marriage in the summer of 1919  against his fathers wishes, of course. Hermann considered her to be a tramp unworthy of the Kafka name, and vented his ire with full passion, suggesting that his son should simply visit a whorehouse: If youre afraid, Ill make it my business to take you there myself. Naturally stung, Kafka would later write, I doubt if you ever verbally humiliated me more profoundly.
Despite Kafkas good intentions, his relationship with Julie was no threat to the family name. When the couple couldnt keep the flat they had planned to live in, the engagement was amicably broken off; although the two maintained a rather cozy friendship for many years afterwards.
By this time, a general armistice had been declared, and the Peace of Paris had made Prague a city of the new nation Czechoslovakia. For his own part, Kafka remained oblivious of international politics  it was family politics that weighed the heaviest on his mind. He returned to Schelesen for a two-week rest, where he spilled out Letter to His Father.
During the first stages of Kafkas illness, his creative life had lapsed back into a period of idleness, his output dwindling down to aphorisms and fragments. But true to the pattern of his writing, the slump was followed by a sudden burst of energy  though this time, its focus was not fiction. Intended as an actual letter to his father, and running for a hundred or so pages, Letter is a tortured, almost frightening rant in which Kafka presents to his father every ruinous example of how Hermann screwed up his sons life. Even at the age of 36, Kafka still couldnt overcome his conflict with father and family  always wanting to break away, always driven to communicate, and still harboring the desire to start a family of his own. Fortunately for Hermann, Kafka did not possess his fathers current address, and the letter was never mailed  although he did eventually show it to his mother. (Interestingly, some biographers contend that she was perhaps its real target.)
In late November 1919, Kafka returned to the Institute. That December, A Country Doctor was published. A collection of short stories written between December 1916 and April 1917, the book was dedicated to his father, who received it with the words, Put it on the night table.
Although Kafka received a promotion at the beginning of 1920, his health took a turn for the worse, the disease having advanced to both lungs. In April, the Institutes new Legal Secretary took an extended leave to Merano, Italy, to take in the famous air of its Alpine spas. While in Merano, he sent a letter to Milena Jesenská-Polak, a translator who had contacted him in the Fall of 1919, asking for permission to translate some of his works into Czech. After a faltering start, Milena began writing back, touching off a whirlwind correspondence. 
In Milena, Kafka finally met his match  she was an intellectual, a true Bohemian in every sense of the word. Free-spirited, candid, and experimentally inclined, she existed in a state of constant rebellion with her father, a wealthy doctor with a nasty anti-Semitic streak. (So dysfunctional was this father-daughter relationship, that after Milena began seeing a Jewish man, Dr. Jesensky had her confined to a lunatic asylum for nine months!) In 1918, Milena fulfilled her fathers worst nightmare and married Ernst Polak, a Jewish playboy and amateur positivist philosopher. The couple moved to Vienna, where she went from suffering her fathers abuse to suffering her husbands: not only did Polak force her to earn her own wage through manual labor, but she remained malnourished, and developed health problems in her lungs. Additionally, as a professed believer in free love, Ernst had no qualms about seeking relationships outside of their marriage.
Milena was an enthusiastic and talented writer, and almost immediately, Kafka realized that hed met a woman who truly shared his passion for correspondence. He opened up to Milena like he never could with Felice, and his letters to her are some of his most honest  and controversial, as he gives full expression to his frustrations as a Jew. Delighted by her translations of his work, he also respected her own writing, and even gave in to her request that he break off relations with Julie Wohryzek. For perhaps the first time in his life, Kafka was in love.
Milena was not content with keeping their relationship epistolary. As things heated up, she began pressuring Kafka to meet her in Vienna on his way home from Merano. After some prevarication, he agreed, and the two spent a delightful four days in Vienna  though they refrained from having sex. (This has led some biographers to question Kafkas  ahem  sexual prowess; but whether his forbearance was the result of impotence or a conscious decision, Milena initially seemed understanding about his obvious sexual anxieties.) Returning home, Kafka began to exert some pressure of his own, suggesting that Milena leave her husband and move to Prague. Unfortunately, Kafka was still obsessed with marriage  a little impractical given the situation; and his letters show numerous tortuous ways for the two to be together without actually resulting in a divorce. Their letters became more strained as Milena kept finding new reasons to stay in Vienna, from her husbands health to a renewal of her fidelity. Finally, she agreed to meet Kafka in Gmünd, a town halfway between the two capitals. It was a very unsatisfactory encounter, filled with much awkwardness and discomfort. Soon afterwards, their affair collapsed, and Kafka insisted that they stop writing to each other.
Despite this agonizing end, the two remained in each others thoughts, and Milena paid him several visits when he was sick in 1921. In a profound gesture of respect and goodwill, Kafka turned over his diaries to her that October. They met for the last time on May 8, 1922, when he presented Milena with the incompleted manuscript of Der Verschollene.
Kafkas health was rapidly becoming unbearable, and between the years 1920 and 1922, he took several more extended leaves, spending his time at sanatoriums, resorts, or just resting in Prague. During this time, he wrote little  creative bursts were followed by long stretches of silence. In June 1922, having tried unsuccessfully to rejoin the work force, he applied for temporary retirement from the Institute. It was granted, and he settled down to continue work on his last major project, The Castle  only to abandon it in August. A severe intestinal infection brought more misery, and his physical condition grew worse. Basically confined to his bed, Kafka renewed his interest in Hebrew, taking lessons from a young female tutor and dreaming of retirement in Palestine.
In July 1923, Kafka retreated to the seaside resort of Müritz, accompanying his sister Elli and her family. There he met the nineteen-year-old Dora Diamant, who was working as a counsellor at a nearby Jewish summer camp. Young, pretty, and full of energy, Dora had broken away from her Hasidic family in Galicia to seek her fortune in Western Europe, which was somewhat more friendly to young Jewish women interested in affairs outside the shtetl. Fluent in Hebrew and Yiddish, and possessing a nurturing, almost motherly streak, Dora proved to be the perfect companion, and within a few weeks the two were planning a future together. Despite the disapproval of both their parents  how shocking  the couple moved to Berlin, bouncing from place to place as the economy collapsed around them. Finally, Kafka had found a way to leave home.
Dora was hard set on taking care of her ailing lover, and Kafka did everything he could to remain active. Some of Kafkas last excursions under his own power were spent attending lectures on the Talmud in the dead of winter. Living in poverty, aware at all times of his decline, the two nevertheless discussed moving to Tel Aviv, perhaps to open a restaurant.
Although Kafka managed to keep writing, it was a passion quite unshared by his new love. Dora felt keenly possessive about her Kafka, and saw his writing as unimportant at best. Only Dora Diamant could understand Franz Kafka, and his work was unwelcome competition for his time and attention. Indeed, unlike Max Brod, Dora did obey Kafkas self-destructive wishes, and of the several pieces he created during his stay in Berlin, only two escaped the flames.
By the middle of 1924, Kafkas health had reached a critical point, and he was forced to return to Prague, where he moved back in with his parents. There, with a sharp pain in his throat, he wrote his last piece  Josephine the Mouse Singer. A few weeks later, Dora arrived and took him to a sanatorium, where he was diagnosed with advanced tuberculosis. The pain in his throat was caused by tubercular lesions  his last months would pass in excruciating agony every time he swallowed. Settling on a sanatorium near Vienna, the couple enlisted the help of Dr. Robert Klopstock, a warm-hearted but eccentric man Kafka had befriended at a previous sanatorium. In the hope that hed improve, he made a special point of carrying out each and every one of the doctors instructions, but his throat remained a constant source of misery. Kafka soon found himself parched and slowly wasting away of starvation. Communicating through the use of notes, he set about correcting the galleys of his next publication: A Hunger Artist.
Although produced in on-and-off spurts, Kafkas last works strike a tone of deep introspection, many wondering sadly but patiently on the prospect of death, the condition of exile, the role of community, and the search for meaning before all chances are lost. If his earlier works explore the relationship between fathers and sons, many of these later pieces meditate on the relationship between the artist and society, and numerous critics have remarked upon their characteristically Jewish themes of exile and the quest for cultural identity. His third and final unfinished novel, The Castle, follows the struggle of a man called K. in his attempt to join a village community. An outsider, K. repeatedly tries to infiltrate the Castle which appears to govern the town, but meets with constant frustration. He carries out cryptic, extended dialogues with the townspeople and Castle officials, making his situation more complicated and hopeless  until the novel simply stops in the middle of a sentence. The story A Hunger Artist, which provides the name for Kafkas final collection, features a man who starves himself as a form of public entertainment. With one disturbing metaphor, Kafka seems to comment on his wasting illness, his ascetic impulses, and his self-image as an artist. One of his last long narratives, The Burrow, was written in Berlin during one extended sitting. It is told from the perspective of a mole-like animal who has built a massive home in the ground, and spends most of his time worrying about its (and his) possible destruction. His final story, Josephine the Mouse Singer, is set among a community of mice. A trembling race lost in a hostile world, they seem to both worship and loathe Josephine, who is after all not really capable of song, but just a piping like any other mouse.
Other than a long letter to his parents shortly before his death, Kafka wrote nothing after Josephine. But still, he exhibited a surprising amount of optimism about his future; an optimism that was encouraged by Dora, Dr. Klopstock, and the visiting Max Brod. As if to make up for lost time, Kafka made plans to marry Dora. Writing her father for permission, he admitted that he had never been an Orthodox Jew; but insisted that he was returning to the faith. The answer was a blunt No.
That night, Dora saw an owl perched upon Kafkas window  the bird of both wisdom and death. From then on, it was a steady decline, with daily doses of alcohol injected straight into the laryngeal nerve. Kafka wouldnt stop asking the doctors for morphine, at one point demanding of Klopstock, Kill me, or else you are a murderer. At another time, he tore off his ice pack, and flinging it across the room with all his remaining strength, he groaned, Dont torture me any more, why prolong the agony?
On noon, June 3, 1924, Franz Kafka died at the age of forty. At his funeral, Dora collapsed on the grave crying, while Hermann turned his back to the scene. Within ten years, both his father and mother would be buried in the same grave.
Max Brod was left as Kafkas literary executor, in the possession of a letter asking him to burn anything in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others), sketches, and so on, which included anything he could get from anybody else. Letters which they do not want to hand over to you, Kafka wrote, they should at least promise faithfully to burn themselves. The only works to be exempted were The Judgment, The Stoker, In The Penal Colony, The Metamorphosis, A Country Doctor, and A Hunger Artist. Everything else was to be consigned to the flames.  
Naturally, Brod took the exact opposite course of action, publishing nearly everything he could find. He justified his actions based on a conversation he had with Kafka three years prior to this, in which his friend had made a similar request. Brod had responded, If you seriously think me capable of such a thing, let me tell you here and now that I shall not carry out your wishes. Although some rather pedantic critics have faulted Brod for publishing against his friends will, most agree that Kafkas request was a clear case of deliberately leaving the fox in charge of the henhouse  a sly way for Farmer Kafka to publish his chickens while avoiding the unseemly appearance of doing so himself. It might also be noted that Brods critics seem to have few problems actually reading the work he saved from the flames....
Whether justifiable or not, Brods disobedience has given us access to a treasury of Kafkas work: a mountain of notebooks and diary entries, stories both finished and incomplete, three unfinished novels, and some delightfully bizarre drawings that he scribbled in his margins. It is said that Brod saved Kafkas work twice: once, from Kafkas own judgment; and again, from the hands of the Nazis, who would have preferred to have had the works burnt and never again seen.
The world Kafka knew only survived him by a decade. His family and friends were left to make sense of a world that exceeded even his worst nightmares. All three of Kafkas sisters died in concentration camps, as did Milena Jesenská-Polak. Grete Bloch died at the hands of a Nazi soldier. Dora Diamant died in London in 1952, and Felice Bauer in 1960. Max Brod, after ensuring that his friends works would outlast and outshine his own, died in Tel Aviv in 1968.
Although at the time of his death Kafka was unknown outside of Prague, over the years his works and fame have spread far and wide. His influence on modern literature is so pervasive that it is nearly impossible to trace  Kafka has become part of the very texture of modern writing, and he practically owns the letter K. A German-speaking Jew from Prague, a lawyer who died young and loathed most everything he wrote, his work has been absorbed by nearly every culture across the globe, inspiring writers as diverse as Jorge Luis Borges in Argentina, Alain Robbe-Grillet in France, William S. Burroughs in the United States, Victor Pelevin in Russia, Kobo Abé in Japan, José Saramago in Portugal, Gabriel García Márquez in Colombia...the list goes on.
Kafkas success may be measured by his presence in popular culture as well  almost every student knows the story of the guy who turns into a bug, and Kafka is one of the few writers to be truly a household name. Indeed, he has become the embarrassed father of the word Kafkaesque.
Its a strange adjective, one supposed to express the feeling that something in our great mechanical city is simply not right. In the curvature of the letters we find a labyrinthine line of desks, where the sacred names of people are stamped, shoved into drawers, and forgotten. Somewhere, maybe behind the word or above it, is a distant law telling us that this isnt the way things should be; but we, unfortunately, are stuck in the middle of it, perhaps between the a and the e, wondering where were to go and laughing at our situation  just to be able to laugh at something.
What makes matters even more hopeless is that Kafkaesque is so overused, it has become a cliché to talk about how the word Kafkaesque is a cliché. When, in Raiders of the Lost Ark, the Ark of the Covenant gets filed in a warehouse in Washington DC, we can make ourselves look smart by turning to each other and saying, Hmmm . . . very Kafkaesque. And when we find out that the men in black in The Matrix are machines dressed up like pale CIA desk-jockeys, we can dance in circles and sing, Its just like Kaaaaaafka.... When we get lost in a maze of tax forms, read about the latest dictator executing people who havent done a thing, or just wake up feeling guilty and paranoid, we can tap our copies of The Trial and mutter, Yup, its all in here. The concept has become so overdone that the word Kafkaesque means practically nothing . . . and isnt that nothing so very Kafkaesque?
Whether we like it or not, Kafka has become an indelible part of our culture. His insecurities are what self-help books have been trying to brush beneath the carpet. His sense of humor shows us how comically mistaken we are. His spiritual quest is ours. The problems he faced in his life and illustrated in his work are the same that we must face today. In Kafka, we have the heart of our humanity beat down into a few slim volumes. It might be beneficial to find out what were all about.

Franz KafkaBorn: 3-Jul-1883Birthplace: Prague, CzechiaDied: 3-Jun-1924Location of death: Kierling, Vienna, AustriaCause of death: TuberculosisRemains: Buried, New Jewish Cemetery, Prague, CzechiaGender: MaleReligion: JewishRace or Ethnicity: WhiteSexual orientation: StraightOccupation: NovelistNationality: AustriaExecutive summary: MetamorphosisFranz Kafka is an icon of dark existentialist and absurdist literature who often wrote about themes of isolation, alienation, and authoritarian oppression.  His best known work includes the short story "The Metamorphosis", in which the main character transforms into a beetle, as well as "In the Penal Colony", "The Hunger Artist", and the novels The Trial, The Castle, and the unfinished Amerika.  Also of note were the various autobiographical observations and literary ideas culled from his many journals as well as his famed "Letter to His Father", in which he attempted to explain their strained relationship and his emotional peculiarities.
Kafka was born in Prague in 1883. Although Kafka was born a Jew he complained of feeling little in common with other Jews.  He attended synagogue but four times a year, spoke mainly German (although Czech had been the language of his childhood), and had little cultural involvement with the Jewish community, with the exception of Jewish theater groups.  His middle class bourgeois family aspired to upward mobility and acceptance into the German mainstream.
As outlined in "Letter to His Father", Franz Kafka's father, Hermann Kafka, was a major influence in the writer's life.  Generally portrayed as large, loud, volatile, and domineering, Hermann Kafka was a self-made man who had risen from poverty to entrepreneur shopkeeper.  The younger Kafka often felt he had more in common with his mother's side of the family.  Kafka's mother, Julie Löwy, was the second child of a well-to-do cloth merchant and brewer, and her relations were more accustomed to a calmer, more genteel approach to life.  Kafka also felt life might have been different if his father's rage might have been spread amongst other sons; however both his younger brothers, George and Heinrich, died when barely out of infancy, and it was left to Franz alone to struggle with the mantle of his father's expectations and frustrations.  Of his three sisters -- Gabrielle (Elli), Valerie (Valli), and Ottilie (Ottla) -- it was the youngest sister, Ottla, whom Franz loved the most, and whom Herman Kafka liked the least. 
As a youngster Franz Kafka was a voracious reader and enjoyed putting on plays for his sisters.  After completing his primary studies, he went on to study law at Charles Ferdinand University (better known as the University of Prague).  After graduation he took a position as a insurance agent, a job he retained until weakness from tuberculosis forced him to retire.  Meanwhile he began writing on the side, and even had a few things published.
But he remained self-deprecating about his writing, as he was about himself in general, and on his death bed asked his close lifelong friend Max Brod to burn all his unpublished works, including journals and correspondence.  It was a promise Brod did not keep.  Instead Brod, who had always been impressed with Kafka's literary abilities, edited a portion of what remained and had it published.  Interest in Kafka's work soared and, over the years, has continued to garner a following.  While Kafka holds a considerable following among existentialists, who find in his gloom and doom anxiety about life an expression of deepest truth (that we are meaningless and alone, yet can't help but yearn for it all to matter), he also finds sympthetic response among magical realists and others who favor an absurdist, surreal representation of life.
Kafka himself attributed much of his outlook on life to the affects of the relationship with his father.  In Letter to His Father (1919) he stated:  "My writing was all about you; all I did there, after all, was to bemoan what I could not bemoan upon your breast. It was an intentionally long-drawn-out leave-taking from you."  His work was often fraught with cold, authoritarian figures that persecuted and threatened for reasons barely understood and often unexplained -- a situation which perfectly summed up Kafka's childhood sense of his own father.
Illness and physical limitation also plagued Kafka, yet another senseless extrusion of suffering which implied to him a callous universe or perverse creator.  In addition to the tuberculosis that had first appeared in 1917, Kafka experienced frequent bouts of insomnia, migraine headaches, boils, constipation, and other ailments.  He was a hypochondriac and possibly an anorexic, as his weight suffered wild fluxuations and his dietary peculiarities progressed through prodigious consumption of unpasteurized milk (a possible source of infectious tuberculosis) to a completely vegan diet.
His attitudes toward sexuality was also marked by extreme neurosis.  Unable to reconcile his physical urges (which were visited upon prostitutes and loose women) with his romantic longings, he had a series of prolonged, probably chaste, engagements that invariably ended in his breaking off the relationship.  Despite this fact, and despite his being overwhelmed with feelings of inadequacy and self-loathing, he was much liked by friends (including women friends) for his gentle, cool demeanor, his wry wit, and his obvious intelligence.  He was further viewed not as weak and repulsive, his own fear, but as boyishly good looking, as well as neat and austere.
Franz Kafka died in 1924 from complications related to tuberculosis.  It has been noted that due to the great pain in his throat, from this condition, he was unable to eat and barely to drink in his last days.  He often complained of thirst in his letters home to his father, and at the end may have simply starved to death.  His body is buried in Prague, in the Jewish section of the Strasnice cemetery.  His mother and father are interred beside him.  All three of his sisters were killed in Nazi concentration camps during World War II.Father: Hermann Kafka (b. 1852, d. 1931)Mother: Julie Löwy (b. 1856, d. 1934).Brother: Georg (d. infancy)Brother: Heinrich (d. infancy)Sister: Gabrielle ("Elli", d.
