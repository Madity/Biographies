A late-1990s overnight sensation, Fiona Apple was cast as the antidote to packaged pop divettes like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Considering her angst-ridden lyrics and her propensity to shock interviewers, some critics classed her among such provocateurs as Alanis Morissette and Sinéad O'Connor; others, listening to her jazz-tinged, full-throated, accomplished debut, compared her to Laura Nyro and Nina Simone.

A late-1990s overnight sensation, Fiona Apple was cast as the antidote to packaged pop divettes like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Considering her angst-ridden lyrics and her propensity to shock interviewers, some critics classed her among such provocateurs as Alanis Morissette and Sinéad O'Connor; others, listening to her jazz-tinged, full-throated, accomplished debut, compared her to Laura Nyro and Nina Simone.
Her parents, actor Brandon Maggart and singer/dancer/chef Diane McAfee, never married and separated when Fiona was four years old. Her father relocated to L.A.; Fiona grew up in Manhattan with her mother and older sister. Teaching herself piano (and starting psychotherapy) at eight, Fiona was drawn to the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Joan Armatrading, and jazz standards. The primary influence she claims was the poet Maya Angelou; Apple herself wrote poetry and journals as a girl, then, at 11, began combining music and lyrics. Moving to L.A. at 16, Apple completed high school through independent study and recorded a three-song demo. She passed a tape along to a friend who baby-sat for Kathryn Schenker, the publicist for Sting and Lenny Kravitz, among others. Impressed by Fiona's precocious talent, Schenker alerted Wallflowers manager Andy Slater, who landed the singer a record contract in early 1996.
Tidal, featuring Apple's melodically and rhythmically intricate songs, strong piano work, and achingly confessional lyrics, along with Slater's inventive production work, drew nearly unalloyed raves. Yet Apple was controversial, speaking openly about her rape at age 12 (the basis for the song "Sullen Girl") and appearing in her underwear for the video for "Criminal" (#21 pop, 1997). The video was interpreted alternately as either self-exploitation or a cryptic denunciation of such exploitation. Accorded Best New Artist in a Video honors at the 1997 MTV Video Awards, Apple, in an obscenity-laced acceptance speech, derided the star-making machinery of show biz and its deleterious effects on adolescents, a maneuver that was mocked by some and praised by others. Musically, with gems like the Modern Rock hit "Shadowboxer" making her case, Apple was unassailable; in media terms, however, she'd become known as a "loose cannon."
In 1999 Apple chose a 90-word "poem" as a title for her followup to the double-platinum-selling Tidal. When the Pawn... (#13, 1999) showed influences ranging from the late Beatles to bossa nova, and yielded the Modern Rock hit "Fast as You Can."
Fionna Apple then entered an extended period of partially productive false-starts, working with producer Jon Brion but remaining artistically apprehensive and confused about the direction of her musical career. After several years and a fresh start, Apple released Extrodinary Machine in late 2005 which was warmly received and garnered a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album.

Fiona Apple McAfee Maggart (born September 13, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter and pianist. Her debut album, Tidal, was released in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance (with an additional six nominations) for the single "Criminal". Subsequent albums include: When the Pawn... (1999), Extraordinary Machine (2005), and The Idler Wheel... (2012).
Apple's vocal range is contralto.[2][3] Her musical style contains elements of jazz and alternative rock.[4][5][6]
Born in New York, Apple is the daughter of singer Diane McAfee and actor Brandon Maggart.[7] Her maternal grandparents were dancer Millicent Green and big band vocalist Johnny McAfee. Her sister sings cabaret under the stage name Maude Maggart, and actor Garett Maggart is her half brother.
At age 12 she was raped outside her apartment.[8] She then developed an eating disorder, purposely slimming her developing body, which she saw as "bait".[9]
Apple was introduced to the music industry in 1994, when she gave a demo tape containing the songs "Never Is a Promise", "Not One of Those Times", and "He Takes a Taxi" to her friend who was the babysitter of music publicist Kathryn Schenker.[10] Schenker then passed the tape along to Sony Music executive Andy Slater.[11] Apple's abilities captured his attention, and Slater signed her to a record deal.[2][3]
In 1996, Apple's debut album, Tidal, was released by Work Records and Columbia Records. The album sold 2.7 million copies and was certified three times platinum in the U.S.[12][13] "Criminal", the third single, became a hit and the song reached the top forty on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The song's controversial Mark Romanek-directed music video played on MTV.[14] Other singles from Tidal included "Shadowboxer", "Sleep to Dream", and "Never Is a Promise". Apple accepted MTV Video Music Award for "Best New Artist" for her song Sleep to Dream in 1997[15] The New Yorker and NYRock criticized her MTV award show speech.[2][10] When I have something to say, I'll say it," she said, responding to these criticisms in an article in Rolling Stone in January 1998.[16]
During this period, Apple also made recordings of The Beatles' "Across the Universe" and Percy Mayfield's "Please Send Me Someone to Love" for the soundtrack of the film Pleasantville. She later canceled the last twenty-one dates on a tour in support of her album due to "personal family problems".[17]
Apple's second album, When the Pawn..., was released in 1999. Its full title is a poem Apple wrote after reading letters that appeared in Spin regarding an article that had cast her in a negative light in an earlier issue.[18] The title's length earned it a spot in the Guinness Book of Records for 2001. However, as of October 2007, it no longer has the longest album title, as Soulwax released Most of the Remixes, a remix album whose title surpasses When the Pawn’s length by 100 characters.[19] When the Pawn was cultivated during Apple's relationship with film director Paul Thomas Anderson. When the Pawn, which was produced by Jon Brion, used more expressive lyrics, experimented more with drum loops, and incorporated both the Chamberlin and drummer Matt Chamberlain.[20] The album received a positive reception from publications such as The New York Times and Rolling Stone. It did not fare as well commercially as her debut, though it was an RIAA-certified platinum album[12] and sold one million copies in the U.S.[13] The album's lead single, "Fast as You Can", reached the top twenty on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart and became Apple's first Top 40 hit in the UK. The videos for two follow-up singles, "Paper Bag" and "Limp" (directed by then-boyfriend Anderson), received very little play.
After performing for forty minutes in a set hampered by equipment issues to 3,000 audience members at the New York City Roseland Ballroom, a frustrated Apple left the stage without returning. Her performance saw Apple appearing distraught at the sound quality, apologizing numerous times for the sound and crying.[21] The incident was described by AOL as "music's most infamous on-stage meltdown".[22] After completing a concert tour in support of her second album in 2000, Apple relocated to Los Angeles. During her hiatus, Apple contemplated retiring from her recording career. Apple sang with Johnny Cash on a cover of Simon & Garfunkel's "Bridge over Troubled Water" that ended up on his album American IV: The Man Comes Around and was nominated for a Grammy Award for "Best Country Collaboration with Vocals". She also collaborated with Cash on Cat Stevens's "Father and Son", which was included in his 2003 collection Unearthed.

Apple's third album, Extraordinary Machine, was originally produced by Jon Brion. In spring 2002, Apple and Jon Brion, her longtime friend and producer on When the Pawn, met for their weekly lunch meeting. Brion reportedly "begged" Apple to make another album. Apple agreed, and Brion went to Apple's label, Epic Records, with strict stipulations (including no deadline), which the label eventually agreed to. Recording sessions began in 2002, at Ocean Way studios in Nashville, Tennessee, but later moved to the Paramour Mansion in Los Angeles. Work on the album continued until 2003, and in May of that year it was submitted to Sony executives. In 2004 and 2005, tracks were leaked on the Internet in MP3 format and played on U.S. and international radio. Subsequently, MP3s of the entire album went online. Although a Web site distributing the album was quickly shutdown, it soon reached P2P networks and was downloaded by fans.[23][24] A fan-led campaign supported the album's official release.
Mike Elizondo, who had previously played bass on Pawn, was brought back as co-producer to complete the tracks he had begun with Brion and Apple. Spin later reported the following: "Fans erroneously thought that Apple's record label, Epic, had rejected the first version of Extraordinary Machine... in reality, according to Elizondo, Apple was unhappy with the results, and it was her decision to redo the record, not her label's."[25] In August 2005, the album was given an October release date.[24] Production had been largely redone "from scratch" by Elizondo and was co-produced by Brian Kehew. Two of the eleven previous leaked tracks were relatively unchanged, and one new song was also included.[26] Despite suggestions that the album had caused a rift between Brion and Apple, they regularly perform together at Largo, a club in Los Angeles, including a joint appearance with Elizondo on bass just before the news broke of an official release.[27] Extraordinary Machine debuted at number seven and was nominated for a Grammy Award for "Best Pop Vocal Album". It was eventually certified gold[12] and sold 600,000 copies in the U.S., though its singles ("Parting Gift", "O' Sailor", "Not About Love" and "Get Him Back") failed to enter any Billboard charts.[28] Apple went on a live tour to promote the album in late 2005.
In June 2006, Apple appeared on the joke track "Come Over and Get It (Up in 'Dem Guts)" by comedian Zach Galifianakis. Galifianakis previously appeared in the music video for Apple's "Not About Love".[29] Apple recorded a cover of "Sally's Song" for the 2006 special edition release of the soundtrack for the Tim Burton film The Nightmare Before Christmas. In May 2006, Apple paid tribute to Elvis Costello on VH1's concert series Decades Rock Live, by performing Costello's hit "I Want You". Her version was subsequently released as a digital single.[30] Apple toured the East Coast during August 2007, with Nickel Creek.[31][32] In 2008, Apple recorded a duet titled "Still I" with Christophe Deluy. In 2009, Apple covered "Why Try to Change Me Now" and "I Walk A Little Faster" for The Best Is Yet to Come - The Songs of Cy Coleman. In January 2010, Fiona Apple and Jon Brion performed together at "Love and Haiti, Too: A Music Benefit", a charity concert for the people hurt by the Haiti earthquake. Fiona sang a cover of "(S)he's Funny That Way", composed by Neil Moret, lyrics by Richard Whiting, which is often associated with the singer Billie Holiday. In June 2010, Fiona released a song titled "So Sleepy", produced by Jon Brion and written by children involved with the non-profit organization 826LA. The song was included on a compilation album released by the organization titled Chickens in Love. Apple collaborated with Margaret Cho on her album Cho Dependent, which was released on August 24, 2010.[33]
In late 2010, Billboard published an article stating that Apple was planning on releasing a new album in spring 2011, with musician Michelle Branch claiming to have heard some of the new tracks.[34] Drummer Charley Drayton also told Modern Drummer magazine that he was co-producing the record.[35] However, the album was not released in the spring and Billboard reported later that Epic was not aware of a record.[36] Apple delayed the album's release until 2012, explaining that she was waiting "until her label found a new president and that she didn’t want her work to be mishandled amid corporate disarray."[37] In January 2012, after its new record label head, LA Reid hinted at new music from Apple, Epic Records announced that the album would be released later in the year.[38] Apple announced performances at the South by Southwest Festival and a spring 2012 tour soon after.[39] The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do,[40][41] Apple's fourth studio album, was released on June 19, 2012, in the United States.[42] According to an article in American Songwriter "The Idler Wheel isn't always pretty, but it pulses with life, brutal and true."[43] Apple contributed a previously unreleased song entitled "Dull Tool" to the soundtrack of the 2012 Judd Apatow film This Is 40.[44] Another song recorded for the film that wasn't included in the soundtrack has yet to be released.[45] In September 2013, a Chipotle ad appeared online with a soundtrack of Apple covering "Pure Imagination" from the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The video, which follows a scarecrow as he discovers the truth about factory farming and processed food, was described as "haunted," "dystopian," "bizarre," and "beautiful."[46][47]
In the mid-1990s Apple dated magician David Blaine,[48] and was romantically linked to director Paul Thomas Anderson,[49] who directed several music videos for her second album.[50] She dated writer and actor Jonathan Ames from 2007 until they parted ways at the end of 2010.[51][52][53]
In a June 2012 interview, it was revealed that Apple had briefly married a French photographer several years ago, "for complicated reasons."[54]
Apple appeared on Marc Maron’s WTF podcast in July 2012 and discussed the “changes in her life and career over the past 15-plus years".[55]
On September 19, 2012 Apple was arrested[56] at an internal Border Patrol checkpoint in Sierra Blanca, Texas and charged with possession of hashish.[57] Authorities detained Apple at the Hudspeth County Jail.
In November 2012, Apple wrote a letter to her fans — a scan of which was posted to her website and her Facebook page — postponing the South American leg of her tour due to the ill-health of her pet dog, Janet. According to the letter, the dog has Addison's disease, and further has had a tumor "idling in her chest" for two years.[58]

                If her album Tidal didn't make waves, then her acceptance speech at the 1997 MTV Video Awards sure did.              
                It is difficult to rate her sex appeal since she doesn't have the conventional sexiness that instantly tells a man she is gorgeous. In fact, most men think the waif look that Fiona sports is downright ugly. We think that is an exaggeration.            
                She is still very young with a lot to learn about the music business. Though she had critical success with her first album Tidal and several Grammy nominations, the music industry works on the what have you done for me lately? concept. Fiona needs more hits.            
                Fiona Apple Maggart was born September 13, 1977, in New York City, and is the offspring of actors Brandon Maggart and Diane McAfee.  Fiona and her older sister Amber had to endure the divorce of their parents, who split up when Fiona was four years old.  The Maggart daughters have more stepsiblings, which their parents had from previous relationships.  Raised by her mother in New York, Fiona began taking piano lessons at the age of eight.  Preferring to improvise (something that would explain Fiona's off-beat statements), a musically inclined Fiona dropped her lessons and taught herself the keyboard.   Fiona's sometimes disturbing image manifested itself at an early age, when an 11-year old Fiona confessed to a friend that she was going to kill herself and her sister.  This prompted several therapy sessions which ultimately led her to believe that must actually be something wrong with her if she required therapy. Anyone would require therapy after what happened to Fiona next.  She was raped when she was 12 years old, in a New York apartment building.  She subtly shares her experience with the public in the song "Sullen Girl", but has candidly broached the topic of the tragic incident in interviews.  Seeing the cup half full, Fiona admits that the experience has actually helped her find her artistic self. On a brighter note, she was discovered after Fiona's friend gave a demo tape of hers to Kathryn Schenker, a music-industry publicist the friend had babysat for.  The world is small indeed, as Schenker's list of clients includes Aerosmith and Sting.  Schenker was impressed with Fiona's music and style, and introduced her to Andrew Slater, a producer-artist manager.  Fiona was signed to WORK, Sony's affiliate label and the rest is history. Her debut album, Tidal was released in 1995 and made a splash in the music industry.  The album spawned hit singles such as "Shadowboxer", "Sleep to Dream" and "Criminal", and fans really took to her piano-rich, introspective, edgy sound. If people had not yet heard Fiona's music, they were sure to hear about her after her acceptance speech for winning the Best New Artist award at the 1997 MTV Video Awards.  There she was, a waify "bad girl", clad in fashionable clothes and shoes, pleading with fans not to follow the images projected to them in the media and to be their own person.  Ironic, coming from a girl who looks like the product of the industry she was blasting. Although her "go with yourself" speech practically became her claim to fame, it did not overshadow her success as she had won nominations for Best New Artist, Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and Best Rock Song (both for "Criminal").  Already having a multi-platinum album under her belt -- thanks to the success of Tidal -- she released her sophomore album, When the Pawn.... Contrary to the dark, sad, woman portrayed in the media, Fiona is smiling on the cover of When the Pawn.... Fiona's romantic history includes magician David Blaine and Magnolia director and screenwriter, Paul Thomas Anderson (who directed Fiona's video for Criminal).

Fiona Apple defied categorization or any easy career path, almost running the pattern in reverse, opening her career as a highly touted and popular alternative singer/songwriter, then transitioning into a cult artist. Apple certainly benefited from the open-door policy of modern rock in the mid-’90s, following the path of crossover alt-rock piano-based songwriters like Tori Amos, but Apple was hardly an Amos copycat: she had a strong jazz undertow in her vocal phrasing and melodies, she had richer arrangements, she had a poppier bent to her songs. All these things helped her 1996 debut, Tidal, find a wide audience, one that increased considerably in the wake of the controversial video for the single “Criminal,” but Apple made it abundantly clear that she wasn’t an amateur provocateur with her sophomore album, When the Pawn Meets the King, an album that increased her critical reputation and cult, which would be pillars of support during her intense battles while making her third album, Extraordinary Machine. 
Born to singer Diana McAfee and actor Brandon Maggart in 1977, Fiona Apple started playing and writing songs at the age of 12, in an effort to work out a traumatic childhood that included a rape at the age of 11. Apple continued to write, leaving high school for Los Angeles at the age of 16. She cut a demo tape that eventually earned her a contract with Sony Music in 1995. Teamed with producer Andrew Slater, she cut her debut, Tidal, releasing the album in the summer of 1996. 
Tidal was a slow build, earning critical acclaim and a cult that exploded when the controversial video for “Criminal” turned the single and album into a hit. Mark Romanek’s seedy, suggestive clip was overtly sexual -- a path Apple notably avoided afterward -- but it did the trick, helping the album reach the Top Ten and earning Apple a Grammy. Despite this titillation, Tidal appealed to the middle of the road, a path Apple definitively rejected with her next album, 1999’s When the Pawn Meets the King. The entire title was a 90-word poem, a fair indication of the artistic ambition that lay within. Produced by Jon Brion, the album was dense, literate, and melodic, not matching the commercial success of the debut but deepening her cult. Despite a romance with director Paul Thomas Anderson -- she contributed to the soundtrack of his 1999 magnum opus Magnolia -- Apple retreated from the spotlight, fostering an element of mystery that only grew when her next album experienced a series of delays. 
By 2003, the lack of a sequel became a sensation among some music message boards, where rumors swirled that Sony rejected her newest music for being uncommercial. Within the next year, unfinished mixes leaked onto the Internet and the saga of the album spilled over into the mainstream, earning ink in The New York Times. All this helped usher the album to completion in the fall of 2005, when the original Brion productions were tweaked and expanded with producer Mike Elizondo, who helped Extraordinary Machine reach its final shape. The album was greeted by generally positive reviews -- some compared it not entirely favorably to the leaked album -- and the record received healthy sales. In its wake, Apple maintained a moderate presence, touring with Nickel Creek in 2007 and appearing with the Watkins Family at times during their residency at the Largo in Los Angeles. In 2012, Apple previewed three songs from her fourth studio album (which boasted a typically enigmatic title in The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do) to a wildly enthusiastic audience at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas. Produced by Apple with her touring drummer, Charley Drayton, the album earned excellent reviews upon release in June 2012. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi

						Singer/songwriter Fiona Apple gained a recording contract in 1995 as one in a crop of mid-'90s female artists, but her confessional writing and throaty vocals made the teenager sound like much more than just the latest flavor. Born in 1977 in New York to singer Diana McAfee and actor Brandon Maggart, Fiona Apple began playing the piano at the age of eight and started composing her own songs just four years later, after the separation of her parents and her own brutal rape. After leaving high school at the age of 16, she journeyed to Los Angeles to see her father and make a demo tape of her songs. After several months of tape-passing, Sony Music signed Apple in 1995. 
After recording Tidal with producer Andrew Slater, she released the album in mid-1996 and began touring. Constant video play of the single "Shadowboxer" on both MTV and VH1 brought Tidal into the upper reaches of the album charts. The long-awaited When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He Thinks Like a King What He Knows Throws the Blows When He Goes to the Fight and He'll Win the Whole Thing 'Fore He Enters the Ring There's No Body to Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might So When You Go Solo, You Hold Your Own Hand and Remember That Depth Is the Greatest of Heights and if You Know Where You Stand, Then You Know Where to Land and if You Fall It Won't Matter, 'Cuz You'll Know That You're Right -- the album's full title -- followed in 1999.
