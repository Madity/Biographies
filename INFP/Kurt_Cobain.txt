                Kurt Cobain was the most important artist of the Nineties even though he lived for less than half of the decade. When the Nirvana rocketed into popular consciousness in 1991 with "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Cobain became the face and enduring icon of alternative rock. He was a musical genius who (briefly) brought punk rock into the mainstream, and a pop craftsman with a gift for setting simple melodies to noisy feedback and distortion. His coarse and grainy wail was the prototype for later alt-rock singers, and his tangled leads and hurricane-like power chords influenced countless subsequent rock guitarists. In his lyrics, Cobain dealt with the thorny discomfort of growing up and railed about his inner demons. Like Bob Dylan, he hated the notion of being dubbed "the voice of a generation" – in Cobain's case, Generation X – but got it anyway.   
Kurt Donald Cobain was born on February 20, 1967, in Hoquiam, Washington, and grew up in the working-class logging town of Aberdeen. His father, Donald, was an auto mechanic and his mother, Wendy, a housewife. He came from a musical family: an uncle played in a band and a great uncle was an Irish tenor who appeared in the 1930 film King of Jazz. At four, Cobain began singing and playing piano, and gravitated to the music of bands ranging from the Beatles to the Ramones. When he was eight, his parents divorced and Cobain was shuttled among various family members, developing a rebellious attitude he would later express in his music.
At fourteen he got his first guitar and learned to play rudimentary rock & roll songs like "Louie Louie" and the Cars' "My Best Friend's Girl." But he was bullied at school for choosing art and music over sports, and by his senior year of high school decided to drop out. Around that time he began hanging out at rehearsals of local band the Melvins, where he met and befriended bass player Krist Novoselic. The two formed Nirvana and by 1987 the band was playing shows at Evergreen State College in nearby Olympia.
In 1989, with drummer Chad Channing, Nirvana released its first album, Bleach, on the Seattle independent label Sub Pop. Replacing Channing with Dave Grohl, the band signed with the major label DGC and began recording Nevermind (Number One, 1991). When that album became a surprise hit, Cobain was thrust into a mainstream pop spotlight he never was completely comfortable with.
He used his fame to advocate for the rights of women, gays and other minorities and teen misfits like himself, while pouring his personal anger and frustration into Nirvana's lyrics and album liner notes. Apart from Nirvana, Cobain collaborated with artists ranging from Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan and Beat writer William S. Burroughs, for whom Cobain provided guitar backing on a spoken-word recording of a short story entitled "The 'Priest' They Called Him." Before his death, Cobain had been in discussions with Michael Stipe of R.E.M. about a possible collaboration.
In the late 1980s Cobain developed a heroin habit that intensified once he began a romantic relationship in 1991 with fellow alternative rocker Courtney Love of Hole. After Nirvana's massive success, the couple's exploits were closely followed by entertainment journalists, and when she became pregnant, stories of their drug use were the fodder for gossip columnists and tabloid newspapers. Cobain and Love married on February 24, 1992; their daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, was born almost six months later on August 18.
Cobain's downfall was swift. Nirvana continued touring and recording and in 1993 released In Utero (Number One). But the Cobains' admission of their drug use in a magazine article led to a children's services battle over the custody of their daughter. That year police were summoned to the couple's home on numerous occasions for incidents involving drugs and weapons, and Cobain was charged at one point with domestic abuse.
In March 1994, while Nirvana was on tour in Europe, Cobain overdosed and lay in a coma for 20 hours. He underwent a series of detoxes and interventions, and by March 30 had checked into Exodus Recovery Center in Los Angeles. But Cobain left the facility the next day and went missing for a week in early April. He had returned to Seattle, where his body was found on April 8 with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head. Cobain was mourned in the days after his suicide by fans, fellow musicians and his wife, and his ashes were scattered into Washington's Wishkah River. He had left behind a powerful musical legacy and some of the era's most enduring songs including "Lithium," "In Bloom," "Heart-Shaped Box," "Pennyroyal Tea" and "About a Girl."
In the years since his death, Cobain's demise has been the topic of much speculation, and numerous books and films on the singer have appeared including writer Charles R. Cross's 2001 biography Heavier Than Heaven, Gus Van Sant's 2005 movie Last Days and scandal documentary maker Nick Broomfield's 1998 film Kurt & Courtney. In 2002, Cobain's own writings were published as Journals.
 Love has continued to make headlines as much for her erratic behavior as for her music. She sanctioned the use of Cobain's likeness for the 2009 video game Guitar Hero 5 but later complained, along with Novoselic and Grohl, when it was revealed that the singer's image also could be used in songs other than his own. In December 2009, co-guardianship of Cobain's daughter, who like her father had been shuttled among relatives throughout her life, was appointed to Cobain's mother and sister. That same month, a judge issued a restraining order against Love, prohibiting her from any contact with the couple's daughter.

Kurt Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967 – c. April 5, 1994) was an American musician and artist, who was best known as the lead singer, guitarist, and primary songwriter of the grunge band Nirvana. Cobain formed Nirvana with Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1985 and established it as part of the Seattle music scene, having its debut album Bleach released on the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989.
After signing with major label DGC Records, the band found breakthrough success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit" from its second album Nevermind (1991). Following the success of Nevermind, Nirvana was labeled "the flagship band" of Generation X, and Cobain hailed as "the spokesman of a generation".[1] Cobain, however, was often uncomfortable and frustrated, believing his message and artistic vision to have been misinterpreted by the public, with his personal issues often subject to media attention. He challenged Nirvana's audience with its final studio album In Utero (1993). It did not match the sales figures of Nevermind but was still a critical and commercial success.
During the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with heroin addiction, illness and depression. He also had difficulty coping with his fame and public image, and the professional and lifelong personal pressures surrounding himself and his wife, musician Courtney Love. On April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead at his home in Seattle, the victim of what was officially ruled a suicide by a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head. The circumstances of his death at age 27 have become a topic of public fascination and debate. Since their debut, Nirvana, with Cobain as a songwriter, has sold over 25 million albums in the US, and over 75 million worldwide. Cobain was inducted - along with fellow Nirvana members Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl - into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, the first year in which they were eligible.
Kurt Donald Cobain was born on February 20, 1967, at Grays Harbor Hospital in Aberdeen, Washington,[2] to a waitress, Wendy Elizabeth (née Fradenburg) (born 1948),[3] and an automotive mechanic, Donald Leland Cobain (born 1946). His parents were married on July 31, 1965 in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. His ancestry included Irish, English, Scottish, and German.[4][5][6] Cobain's Irish ancestors migrated from Carrickmore, County Tyrone in the north of Ireland in 1875.[6] Researchers have found them to have been shoemakers, originally named Cobane, who came from Inishatieve, a townland within Carrickmore parish, settling in Cornwall, Ontario, Canada, and then in Washington.[7] Cobain himself believed his family came from County Cork in southern Ireland.[8] Cobain had one younger sister named Kimberly, born on April 24, 1970.[3][5]
Cobain's family had a musical background. His maternal uncle Chuck Fradenburg starred in a band called The Beachcombers, his Aunt Mari Earle played guitar and performed in bands throughout Grays Harbor County, and his great-uncle Delbert had a career as an Irish tenor, making an appearance in the 1930 film King of Jazz. Cobain was described as being a happy and excitable, while sensitive and caring child. His talent as an artist was evident from an early age. His bedroom was described as having taken on the appearance of an art studio,[2] where he would accurately draw his favorite characters from films and cartoons such as Aquaman, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and Disney characters like Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse, and Pluto.[9] This enthusiasm was encouraged by his grandmother Iris Cobain, who was a professional artist herself. Cobain began developing an interest in music early in his life. According to his Aunt Mari, he began singing at two years old. At age four, Cobain started playing the piano and singing, writing a song about their trip to a local park. He listened to artists like the Ramones[10] and Electric Light Orchestra[11] and would sing songs like Arlo Guthrie's "Motorcycle Song," The Beatles' "Hey Jude", Terry Jacks' "Seasons in the Sun" and the theme song to The Monkees television show at a young age.[12]
When Cobain was seven years old, his parents divorced.[13] Later in his life, he said the divorce had a profound effect on his life. His mother noted that his personality changed dramatically; Cobain became defiant and withdrawn.[14] In a 1993 interview, he elaborated:
"I remember feeling ashamed, for some reason. I was ashamed of my parents. I couldn't face some of my friends at school anymore, because I desperately wanted to have the classic, you know, typical family. Mother, father. I wanted that security, so I resented my parents for quite a few years because of that."[15]
Cobain's parents both found new partners after the divorce. His father had promised not to remarry; however, after meeting Jenny Westeby, he did, to Kurt's dismay.[16] Kurt, his father, Westeby, and her two children Mindy and James, moved into a new household together. Cobain liked Westeby at first, who gave him the maternal attention he desired.[16][17] In January 1979, Westeby gave birth to a boy, Chad Cobain.[16] This new family, which Cobain insisted was not his real one, was in stark contrast to the attention Cobain was used to receiving as an only boy; he soon began to express resentment toward his stepmother.[16][17] Kurt's mother began dating a man who was abusive. Cobain witnessed the domestic violence inflicted upon her, with one incident resulting in her being hospitalized with a broken arm.[17][18] Wendy steadfastly refused to press charges, remaining completely committed to the relationship.[18]
Kurt behaved insolently toward adults. He began bullying another boy at school. These behaviors eventually caused his father and Westeby to take him to a therapist, who concluded that Kurt would benefit in a single family environment.[18] Both sides of the family attempted to bring his parents back together, but to no avail. On June 28, 1979, Cobain's mother granted full custody of Kurt to his father.[19]
Cobain's teenage rebellion quickly became overwhelming for his father, who placed Kurt in the care of family and friends. While living with the born-again Christian family of his friend Jesse Reed, Cobain became a devout Christian and regularly attended church services. Cobain later renounced Christianity, engaging in what would be described as "anti-God" rants. The song "Lithium" is about his experience while living with the Reed family. Religion would remain an important part of Cobain's personal life and beliefs, as he often used Christian imagery in his work and maintained a constant interest in Jainism and Buddhist philosophy. The band name Nirvana was taken from the Buddhist concept, which Cobain described as "freedom from pain, suffering and the external world," which paralleled with the punk rock ethic and ideology. Cobain would regard himself as both a Buddhist and a Jain during different points of his life, educating himself about the philosophies through various sources, including through watching late night television documentaries on both subjects.[20][21][22]
Although not interested in sports, Kurt was enrolled in a junior high school wrestling team at the insistence of his father. Kurt was a skilled wrestler, yet despised the experience. Because of the ridicule he endured from his teammates and coach, he allowed himself to be pinned, in an attempt to sadden his father. Later, his father enlisted him in a Little League Baseball team, where Cobain would intentionally strike out to avoid playing on the team.[23]
Cobain befriended a homosexual student at school, and suffered bullying from heterosexual students who concluded that Cobain was gay. In an interview he said that he liked having the identity of being gay because he did not like people and when they thought he was gay they left him alone. Kurt stated, "I started being really proud of the fact that I was gay even though I wasn't". His friend tried to kiss him and Kurt backed away and told his friend he was not gay but would still be friends with him. In a 1993 interview with The Advocate, Cobain claimed that he was "gay in spirit" and "probably could be bisexual." He also stated that he used to spray paint "God Is Gay" on pickup trucks in the Aberdeen area. Aberdeen police records show that Cobain was arrested for spray painting the phrase "Ain't got no how watchamacallit" on other vehicles.[24] One of his personal journals states, "I am not gay, although I wish I were, just to piss off homophobes."[25]
Cobain enjoyed creating works of art. He would often draw during school classes, including objects associated with human anatomy. When given a caricature assignment for an art course, Cobain drew a posing Michael Jackson. When his art teacher told him the caricature would be inappropriate to be displayed in a school hallway, Cobain drew an unflattering sketch of then-President Ronald Reagan.[26]
As attested to by several of Cobain's classmates and family members, the first concert he attended was Sammy Hagar and Quarterflash at the Seattle Center Coliseum in 1983.[2][27] Cobain, however, claimed that the first concert he attended was the Melvins; he wrote prolifically in his Journals of the experience.[28] As a teenager living in Montesano, Cobain eventually found escape through the thriving Pacific Northwest punk scene, going to punk rock shows in Seattle. Cobain soon began frequenting the practice space of fellow Montesano musicians the Melvins.
During his second year in high school, Cobain began living with his mother in Aberdeen. Two weeks prior to graduation, he dropped out of Aberdeen High School upon realizing he did not have enough credits to graduate. His mother gave him a choice: find employment or leave. After one week, Cobain found his clothes and other belongings packed away in boxes.[29] Feeling banished from his own mother's home, Cobain stayed with friends, occasionally sneaking back into his mother's basement.[30] Cobain also claimed during periods of homelessness to have lived under a bridge over the Wishkah River,[30] an experience that inspired the Nevermind track "Something in the Way". However, Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic said, "He hung out there, but you couldn't live on those muddy banks, with the tides coming up and down. That was his own revisionism."[31]
In late 1986 Cobain moved into an apartment, paying his rent by working at "The Polynesian Resort", a Polynesian coastal resort approximately 20 miles (32 km) north of Aberdeen.[32] During this period, he was traveling frequently to Olympia, Washington to go to rock concerts.[33] During his visits to Olympia, Cobain formed a relationship with Tracy Marander. The couple had a close relationship, but one that was often strained with financial difficulties and Cobain's absence when touring. Marander supported the couple by working at the cafeteria of the Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, often stealing food. Cobain spent most of his time sleeping into the late evening, watching television and concentrating on art projects. Marander's insistence that he get a job caused arguments that influenced Cobain to write "About a Girl", which was featured on the Nirvana album Bleach. Marander is credited with having taken the cover photo for the album. Marander was not aware that "About a Girl" was written about her until years after Cobain's death.[34][35][36][37][38][39]
Soon after Marander separated from him, Cobain began dating Tobi Vail, an influential DIY punk zinester of the riot grrrl band Bikini Kill. After meeting Vail, Cobain vomited as he was so completely overwhelmed with anxiety regarding his infatuation with her. This event would inspire the lyric: "Love you so much it makes me sick," which would appear in the song "Aneurysm".[40] While Cobain would regard Vail as his female counterpart, his relationship with her waned. Cobain desired the maternal comfort of a traditional relationship, which Vail regarded as sexist within a countercultural punk rock community. Those who dated Vail would be described by her friend Alice Wheeler as "fashion accessories."[39] Kurt and Tobi spent most of their time together as a couple discussing political and philosophical issues. In 1990 they collaborated on a musical project called "Bathtub Is Real", in which both Vail and Cobain sang, played guitar and drums. They recorded their songs on a four-track tape machine that belonged to Vail's father. In Everett True's 2009 book "Nirvana: The Biography"[41] Vail is quoted as saying "(Kurt) would play the songs he was writing, I would play the songs I was writing and we'd record them on my dad's four-track. Sometimes I'd sing on the songs he was writing and play drums on them..... He was really into the fact that I was creative and into music. I don't think he'd ever played music with a girl before. He was super-inspiring and fun to play with." Slim Moon described their sound as "... like the minimal quiet pop songs that Olympia is known for. Both of them sang; it was really good."[42] Cobain's relationship with Vail would inspire the lyrical content of many of the songs on Nevermind. Once, while discussing anarchism and punk rock with friend Kathleen Hanna, Hanna spray-painted "Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit" on Kurt's apartment wall. Teen Spirit was the name of a deodorant Vail wore; Hanna joked that Cobain smelled like it. Cobain, unaware of this, initially interpreted the slogan as having a revolutionary meaning. The slogan inspired the title to the song "Smells Like Teen Spirit".
On his 14th birthday on February 20, 1981, Cobain's uncle offered him either a bike or a used guitar. He chose the guitar. Soon, he was mastering Led Zeppelin's power ballad "Stairway to Heaven". Cobain began learning guitar with a few covers, including "Louie Louie", The Cars' "My Best Friend's Girl", and soon began working on his own songs.[22][not in citation given] During high school, Cobain rarely found anyone with whom he could play music. While hanging out at the Melvins' practice space, he met Krist Novoselic, a fellow devotee of punk rock. Novoselic's mother owned a hair salon. Cobain and Novoselic would occasionally practice in the upstairs room of the salon. A few years later, Cobain tried to convince Novoselic to form a band with him by lending him a copy of a home demo recorded by Cobain's earlier band, Fecal Matter. After months of asking, Novoselic finally agreed to join Cobain, forming the beginnings of Nirvana.[43]
Cobain was disenchanted after early touring, due to the band's inability to draw substantial crowds and the apparent difficulty in sustaining themselves. During their first few years playing together, Novoselic and Cobain were hosts to a rotating list of drummers. Eventually, the band settled on Chad Channing, with whom Nirvana recorded the album Bleach, released on Sub Pop Records in 1989. Cobain, however, became dissatisfied with Channing's style, leading the band to find a new drummer, eventually settling on Dave Grohl. With Grohl, the band found their greatest success via their 1991 major-label debut, Nevermind.
With the lead single "Smells Like Teen Spirit" from Nirvana's second album Nevermind (1991), Nirvana entered the mainstream, popularizing a subgenre of alternative rock called grunge. Since their debut, Nirvana, with Cobain as a songwriter, have sold over 25 million albums in the United States alone, and over 75 million worldwide.[44][45]
The success of Nevermind provided numerous Seattle bands such as Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden access to wider audiences, and as a result, alternative rock became a dominant genre on radio and music television in the United States during the early-to-middle 1990s. Nirvana was considered the "flagship band of Generation X", and frontman Cobain found himself reluctantly anointed by the media as the generation's "spokesman."[1] Cobain's discomfort with the media attention prompted him to focus on the band's music and, believing their message and artistic vision to have been misinterpreted by the public, challenged the band's audience with its third studio album In Utero (1993).
Cobain struggled to reconcile the massive success of Nirvana to his underground roots. He also felt persecuted by the media, comparing himself to Frances Farmer. He began to harbor resentments for people who claimed to be fans of the band yet refused to acknowledge, or misinterpreted, the band's social and political views. A vocal opponent of sexism, racism and homophobia, he was publicly proud that Nirvana had played at a gay rights benefit supporting No-on-Nine in Oregon in 1992, in opposition to Ballot Measure Nine, a ballot measure, that if passed, would have prohibited schools in the state from acknowledging or positively accepting LGBT rights and welfare.
Cobain was a vocal supporter of the pro-choice movement, and had been involved in Rock for Choice from the campaign inception by L7. He received death threats from a small number of anti-abortion activists for doing so, with one activist threatening Cobain that he would be shot as soon as he stepped on stage.[46]
The Beatles were an early and lasting influence on Cobain; his aunt Mari remembers him singing "Hey Jude" at the age of two.[12] "My aunts would give me Beatles records," Cobain told Jon Savage in 1993, "so for the most part [I listened to] the Beatles [as a child], and if I was lucky, I'd be able to buy a single."[15] Cobain expressed a particular fondness for John Lennon, whom he called his "idol" in his posthumously-released journals,[25] and he admitted that he wrote the song "About a Girl," from Nirvana 1989 debut album Bleach, after spending three hours listening to Meet the Beatles!.[47]
Cobain was also a fan of 1970s hard rock and heavy metal bands, including Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Aerosmith, Queen, and Kiss. Nirvana occasionally played cover songs by these bands, including Led Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song", "Dazed and Confused" and "Heartbreaker", Black Sabbath's "Hand of Doom," and Kiss' "Do You Love Me?", and wrote the Incesticide song "Aero Zeppelin" as a tribute to Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith.
Punk rock proved to be a profound influence on a teenaged Cobain's attitude and artistic style. His first punk rock album was Sandinista! by The Clash,[48] but he became a bigger fan of a fellow 1970s British punk band the Sex Pistols, describing them as "one million times more important than the Clash" in his journals.[25] He was introduced to 1980s American hardcore bands like Black Flag, Bad Brains, Millions of Dead Cops and Flipper by Buzz Osborne, lead singer and guitarist of the Melvins and fellow Aberdeen, Washington native. Osborne taught Cobain about Punk by loaning him records and old copies of the Detroit based magazine Creem.[49] The Melvins themselves were an important early musical influence on Cobain, with their heavy, grungey sound mimicked by Nirvana on many songs from Bleach.
Cobain was also a fan of protopunk acts like the Stooges, whose 1973 album Raw Power he listed as his favorite of all time in his journals,[25] and The Velvet Underground, whose 1968 song "Here She Comes Now" the band covered both live and in the studio.
The 1980s American alternative rock band Pixies were instrumental in helping an adult Cobain develop his own songwriting style. In a 1992 interview with Melody Maker, Cobain said that hearing their 1988 debut album, Surfer Rosa, "convinced him to abandon his more Black Flag-influenced songwriting in favor of the Iggy Pop/Aerosmith–type songwriting that appeared on Nevermind.[50] In a 1993 interview with Rolling Stone, he said that "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was his attempt at "trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it. When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily that I should have been in that band—or at least a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard."[51]
Cobain's appreciation of early alternative rock bands also extended to Sonic Youth and R.E.M., both of which the members of Nirvana befriended and looked up to for advice. It was under recommendation from Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon that Nirvana signed to DGC in 1990,[52] and both bands did a two-week tour of Europe in the summer of 1991, as documented in the 1992 documentary, 1991: The Year Punk Broke. In 1993, Cobain said of R.E.M.: "If I could write just a couple of songs as good as what they've written ... I don't know how that band does what they do. God, they're the greatest. They've dealt with their success like saints, and they keep delivering great music."[51]
After attaining mainstream success, Cobain became a devoted champion of lesser known indie bands, covering songs by The Vaselines, Meat Puppets, Wipers and Fang onstage and/ or in the studio, wearing Daniel Johnston T-shirts during photo shoots, having the K Records logo tattooed on his forearm, and enlisting bands like Butthole Surfers, Shonen Knife, Chokebore and Half Japanese along for the In Utero tour in late 1993 and early 1994. Cobain even invited his favorite musicians to perform with him: ex-Germs guitarist Pat Smear joined the band in 1993, and the Meat Puppets appeared onstage during Nirvana's 1993 MTV Unplugged appearance to perform three songs from their second album, Meat Puppets II.
Nirvana's Unplugged set also included renditions of "The Man Who Sold the World," by British rock musician David Bowie, and the American folk song, "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," as adapted by the American folk musician, Lead Belly. Cobain introduced the latter by calling Lead Belly his favorite performer, and in a 1993 interview revealed he had been introduced to him from reading the American author, William S. Burroughs. "I remember [Burroughs] saying in an interview, "These new rock'n'roll kids should just throw away their guitars and listen to something with real soul, like Leadbelly,'" Cobain said. "I'd never heard about Leadbelly before so I bought a couple of records, and now he turns out to be my absolute favorite of all time in music. I absolutely love it more than any rock'n'roll I ever heard."[53]
Nirvana's acoustic Unplugged set, which was released posthumously as an album in 1994, may have provided a hint of Cobain's future musical direction. The record has drawn comparisons to R.E.M.'s 1992 release, Automatic for the People,[54] and in 1993, Cobain himself predicted that the next Nirvana album would be "pretty ethereal, acoustic, like R.E.M.'s last album."[51]
"Yeah, he talked a lot about what direction he was heading in," Cobain's friend, R.E.M.'s lead singer Michael Stipe, told Newsweek in 1994. "I mean, I know what the next Nirvana recording was going to sound like. It was going to be very quiet and acoustic, with lots of stringed instruments. It was going to be an amazing fucking record, and I'm a little bit angry at him for killing himself. He and I were going to record a trial run of the album, a demo tape. It was all set up. He had a plane ticket. He had a car picking him up. And at the last minute he called and said, 'I can't come.' Stipe was chosen as the godfather of Cobain and Courtney Love's daughter, Frances Bean Cobain."[55]
The Fender Mustang Lake Placid Blue guitars played by Kurt Cobain during the filming of the video for Smells Like Teen Spirit, shown at the Seattle Experience Music Project.
Dave Grohl stated that Cobain believed that music comes first and lyrics, second. Cobain focused, foremost, on the melodies of his songs.[56] Cobain complained when fans and rock journalists attempted to decipher his singing and extract meaning from his lyrics, writing "Why in the hell do journalists insist on coming up with a second-rate Freudian evaluation of my lyrics, when 90 percent of the time they've transcribed them incorrectly?"[57] While Cobain would insist on the subjectivity and unimportance of his lyrics, he was known to labor and procrastinate in writing them, often changing the content and order of lyrics during performances.[58] Cobain would describe his lyrics himself as "a big pile of contradictions. They're split down the middle between very sincere opinions that I have and sarcastic opinions and feelings that I have and sarcastic and hopeful, humorous rebuttals toward cliché bohemian ideals that have been exhausted for years."[59]
Cobain originally wanted Nevermind to be divided into two sides: a "Boy" side, for the songs written about the experiences of his early life and childhood, and a "Girl" side, for the songs written about his dysfunctional relationship with Tobi Vail.[58] Charles R. Cross would write "In the four months following their break-up, Kurt would write a half dozen of his most memorable songs, all of them about Tobi Vail". Though "Lithium" had been written before Cobain knew Vail, the lyrics of the song were changed to reference her.[60] Cobain would say in an interview with Musician that "some of my very personal experiences, like breaking up with girlfriends and having bad relationships, feeling that death void that the person in the song is feeling. Very lonely, sick."[61] While Cobain would regard In Utero "for the most part very impersonal",[62] on the album he dealt with the childhood divorce of his parents, his newfound fame and the public image and perception of himself and Courtney Love on "Serve the Servants", with his enamored relationship with Love conveyed through lyrical themes of pregnancy and the female anatomy on "Heart-Shaped Box". Cobain wrote "Rape Me" not only as an objective discussion of rape, but a metaphorical protest against his treatment by the media. He wrote about fame, drug addiction and abortion on "Pennyroyal Tea", as well as women's rights and the life of Seattle-born Frances Farmer on "Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle".
Cobain was affected enough to write the song "Polly" from Nevermind, after reading a newspaper story of an incident in 1987, where a 14-year old girl was kidnapped after attending a punk rock show then raped and tortured with a blowtorch. She managed to escape after gaining the trust of her captor, Gerald Friend through flirting with him.[63] After seeing Nirvana perform, Bob Dylan would cite "Polly" as the best of Nirvana's songs, and was quoted as saying about Cobain, "the kid has heart".[64] Patrick Süskind's novel Perfume: The Story of a Murderer inspired Cobain to write the song "Scentless Apprentice" from In Utero. The book is an historical horror novel about a perfumer's apprentice born with no body odor of his own but with a highly developed sense of smell, and who attempts to create the "ultimate perfume" by killing virginal women and taking their scent.[65]
Cobain immersed himself in artistic projects throughout his life, as much so as he did in songwriting. The sentiments of his art work followed the same subjects of his lyrics, often expressed through a dark and macabre sense of humor. Noted was his fascination with physiology, his own rare medical conditions, and the human anatomy. Often unable to afford artistic resources, Cobain would improvise with materials, painting on board games and album sleeves, and painting with an array of substances, including his own bodily fluids. The artwork seen in his Journals would later draw acclaim as being of a high artistic standard. Many of Cobain's paintings, collages, and sculptures would appear in the artwork of Nirvana's albums. His artistic concepts would feature notably in Nirvana's music videos; the production and direction of which were acrimonious due to the artistic perfectionism of his visions.
Cobain would contribute backing guitar for a spoken word recording of beat poet William S. Burroughs' entitled "The "Priest" They Called Him".[66] Cobain regarded Burroughs as a hero. During Nirvana's European tour Cobain kept a copy of Burroughs' Naked Lunch, purchased in a London bookstall.[67]
Courtney Love and Cobain met on January 12, 1990, in Portland's Satyricon nightclub,[68] when they both still led ardent underground rock bands.[69] Love made advances, but Cobain was evasive. Early in their interactions, Cobain broke off dates and ignored Love's advances because he was unsure if he wanted a relationship. Cobain noted, "I was determined to be a bachelor for a few months [...] But I knew that I liked Courtney so much right away that it was a really hard struggle to stay away from her for so many months."[70] Courtney Love first saw Cobain perform in 1989 at a show in Portland, Oregon; they talked briefly after the show and Love developed a crush on him.[71]
Cobain was already aware of Love through her role in the 1987 film Straight to Hell. According to journalist Everett True, the pair were formally introduced at an L7 and Butthole Surfers concert in Los Angeles in May 1991.[72] In the weeks that followed, after learning from Dave Grohl that Cobain shared mutual interests with her, Love began pursuing Cobain. In late 1991 the two were often together and bonded through drug use.[73]
Around the time of Nirvana's 1992 performance on Saturday Night Live, Love discovered that she was pregnant with Cobain's child. On February 24, 1992, a few days after the conclusion of Nirvana's Pacific Rim tour, Cobain and Love were married on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii. Love wore a satin and lace dress once owned by the actress Frances Farmer, and Cobain wore green pajamas, because he had been "too lazy to put on a tux". In an interview with The Guardian, Love revealed the opposition to their marriage from various people: "Kim Gordon [of Sonic Youth] sits me down and says, 'If you marry him your life is not going to happen, it will destroy your life.' But I said, 'Whatever! I love him, and I want to be with him!'... It wasn't his fault. He wasn't trying to do that."
In a 1992 article in Vanity Fair, Love admitted to using heroin, not knowing that she was pregnant. Love claimed that Vanity Fair had misquoted her,[74] but the event created a media controversy for the couple. While Cobain and Love's romance had always been a media attraction, they found themselves hounded by tabloid reporters after the article was published, many wanting to know if Frances was addicted to drugs at birth. The Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services took the Cobains to court, claiming that the couple's drug usage made them unfit parents.[75] Two-week-old Frances was ordered by the judge to be taken from their custody and placed with Courtney's sister Jamie for several weeks, after which the couple obtained custody in an exchange agreement to submit to urine tests and regular visits from a social worker. After months of legal wrangling, the couple were eventually granted full custody of their daughter.
Throughout most of his life, Cobain suffered from chronic bronchitis and intense physical pain due to an undiagnosed chronic stomach condition.[76] His first drug experience was with marijuana in 1980, at age 13. He regularly used the drug during adulthood.[77] Cobain also had a period of consuming "notable" amounts of LSD, as observed by Tracy Marander,[78] and was "really into getting fucked up: drugs, acid, any kind of drug", observed Krist Novoselic; Cobain was also prone to alcoholism and solvent abuse.[77] Cobain's cousin Beverly, a nurse, claimed Cobain was diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder as a child, and bipolar disorder as an adult. She also brought attention to the history of suicide, mental illness and alcoholism in the Cobain family, noting two of her uncles who had committed suicide with guns.[79]
Cobain's first experience with heroin occurred sometime in 1986, administered to him by a local drug dealer in Tacoma, Washington who had previously supplied him with Percodan.[80] He used heroin sporadically for several years, but, by the end of 1990, his use developed into a full-fledged addiction. Cobain claimed that he was "determined to get a habit" as a way to self-medicate his stomach condition. "It started with three days in a row of doing heroin and I don't have a stomach pain. That was such a relief," he related.[81]
His heroin use began to affect the band's Nevermind supporting tour. One such example came the day of the band's 1992 performance on Saturday Night Live, where Nirvana had a photographic session with photographer Michael Levine. Having taken heroin beforehand, Cobain fell asleep several times during the shoot. Cobain divulged to biographer Michael Azerrad, "I mean, what are they supposed to do? They're not going to be able to tell me to stop. So I really didn't care. Obviously to them it was like practicing witchcraft or something. They didn't know anything about it so they thought that any second, I was going to die."[82]
Slowly, Cobain's heroin addiction worsened. His first attempt at rehab was made in early 1992, not long after he and Love discovered they were going to become parents. Immediately after leaving rehab, Nirvana embarked on their Australian tour, with Cobain appearing pale and gaunt while suffering through withdrawal. Not long after returning home, Cobain's heroin use resumed.
Prior to a performance at the New Music Seminar in New York City in July 1993, Cobain suffered a heroin overdose. Rather than calling for an ambulance, Love injected Cobain with Narcan to bring him out of his unconscious state. Cobain proceeded to perform with Nirvana, giving the public no indication that anything out of the ordinary had taken place.[83]
Cobain's suicide note (full transcription). The final phrase before the valediction, "it's better to burn out than to fade away", is a quote from the lyrics of Neil Young's song "Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)"
Following a tour stop at Terminal Eins in Munich, Germany, on March 1, 1994, Cobain was diagnosed with bronchitis and severe laryngitis. He flew to Rome the next day for medical treatment, and was joined there by his wife, Courtney Love, on March 3, 1994. The next morning, Love awoke to find that Cobain had overdosed on a combination of champagne and Rohypnol. Cobain was immediately rushed to the hospital, and spent the rest of the day unconscious. After five days in the hospital, Cobain was released and returned to Seattle.[3] Love later stated that the incident was Cobain's first suicide attempt.[84]
On March 18, 1994, Love phoned the Seattle police informing them that Cobain was suicidal and had locked himself in a room with a gun. Police arrived and confiscated several guns and a bottle of pills from Cobain, who insisted that he was not suicidal and had locked himself in the room to hide from Love. When questioned by police, Love said that Cobain had never mentioned that he was suicidal and that she had not seen him with a gun.
Love arranged an intervention regarding Cobain's drug use on March 25, 1994. The ten people involved included musician friends, record company executives, and one of Cobain's closest friends, Dylan Carlson. The intervention was initially unsuccessful, with an angry Cobain insulting and heaping scorn on its participants and eventually locking himself in the upstairs bedroom. However, by the end of the day, Cobain had agreed to undergo a detox program.[85] Cobain arrived at the Exodus Recovery Center in Los Angeles, California on March 30, 1994. The staff at the facility were unaware of Cobain's history of depression and prior attempts at suicide. When visited by friends, there was no indication to them that Cobain was in any negative or suicidal state of mind. He spent the day talking to counselors about his drug abuse and personal problems, happily playing with his daughter Frances. These interactions were the last time Cobain saw his daughter. The following night, Cobain walked outside to have a cigarette, and climbed over a six-foot-high fence to leave the facility (which he had joked earlier in the day would be a stupid feat to attempt). He took a taxi to Los Angeles Airport and flew back to Seattle. On the flight, he sat next to Duff McKagan of Guns N' Roses. Despite Cobain's own personal animosity towards Guns N' Roses and specifically Axl Rose, Cobain "seemed happy" to see McKagan. McKagan later stated he knew from "all of my instincts that something was wrong."[86] Most of his close friends and family were unaware of his whereabouts. On April 2 and 3, 1994, Cobain was spotted in numerous locations around Seattle. On April 3, 1994, Love contacted private investigator Tom Grant, and hired him to find Cobain. Cobain was not seen on April 4, 1994. On April 7, 1994, amid rumors of Nirvana breaking up, the band pulled out of that year's Lollapalooza music festival.
On April 8, 1994, Cobain's body was discovered at his Lake Washington Blvd home by an electrician named Gary Smith[87] who had arrived to install a security system. Apart from a minor amount of blood coming out of Cobain's ear, the electrician reported seeing no visible signs of trauma, and initially believed that Cobain was asleep until he saw the shotgun pointing at his chin. A note was found, addressed to Cobain's childhood imaginary friend "Boddah", that stated that Cobain had not "felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music, along with really writing . . . for too many years now". A high concentration of heroin and traces of diazepam were also found in his body. Cobain's body had been lying there for days; the coroner's report estimated Cobain to have died on April 5, 1994.[88]
A public vigil was held for Cobain on April 10, 1994, at a park at Seattle Center drawing approximately seven thousand mourners.[89] Prerecorded messages by Krist Novoselic and Courtney Love were played at the memorial. Love read portions of Cobain's suicide note to the crowd, crying and chastising Cobain. Near the end of the vigil, Love arrived at the park and distributed some of Cobain's clothing to those who still remained.[90] Dave Grohl would say that the news of Cobain's death was "probably the worst thing that has happened to me in my life. I remember the day after that I woke up and I was heartbroken that he was gone. I just felt like, 'Okay, so I get to wake up today and have another day and he doesn't.'" He also believed that he knew Cobain would die at an early age, saying that "sometimes you just can't save someone from themselves," and "in some ways, you kind of prepare yourself emotionally for that to be a reality."[91] Dave Reed, who for a short time was Cobain's foster father, said that "he had the desperation, not the courage, to be himself. Once you do that, you can't go wrong, because you can't make any mistakes when people love you for being yourself. But for Kurt, it didn't matter that other people loved him; he simply didn't love himself enough."[92]
A final ceremony was arranged for Cobain, by his mother, on May 31, 1999, and was attended by both Love and Tracy Marander. As a Buddhist monk chanted, daughter Frances Bean scattered Cobain's ashes into McLane Creek in Olympia, the city where he "had found his true artistic muse."[92]
Cobain's artistic endeavors and struggles with heroin addiction, illness and depression, as well as the circumstances of his death have become a frequent topic of fascination, debate, and controversy throughout the world. According to a Seattle Police Department spokeswoman, the department receives at least one weekly request, mostly through Twitter, to reopen the investigation, resulting in the maintenance of the basic incident report on file.[93] Cobain is one of the well known members of the 27 Club.
In March 2014, the Seattle police developed four rolls of film that had been left in an evidence vault—a reason was not provided for why the rolls were not developed earlier. According to the Seattle police, the 35mm film photographs show the scene of Cobain's dead body more clearly than previous Polaroid images taken by the police. Detective Mike Ciesynski, a cold case investigator, was instructed to look at the film because "it is 20 years later and it’s a high media case." Ciesynski stated that Cobain's death remains a suicide and that the images will not be released publicly.[93] The photos in question were later released, one by one, weeks before the 20th anniversary of Cobain's death. One photo shows Cobain's arm, still wearing the hospital bracelet from the drug rehab facility he checked out of just a few days prior to returning to Seattle. Another photo shows Cobain's foot resting next to a bag of shotgun shells, one of which was used in his death.[94]
In 2005, a sign was put up in Aberdeen, Washington, that reads "Welcome to Aberdeen – Come As You Are" as a tribute to Cobain.
Cobain has been remembered as one of the most iconic rock musicians in the history of alternative music. In 2003, David Fricke of Rolling Stone ranked him the 12th greatest guitarist of all time.[95] He was later ranked the 73rd greatest guitarist and 45th greatest singer of all time by the same magazine,[96][97] and by MTV as 7th in the "22 Greatest Voices in Music".[98] In 2006, he was placed at number twenty by Hit Parader on their list of the "100 Greatest Metal Singers of All Time".[99] Reflecting on Cobain's death over ten years later, MSNBC's Eric Olsen wrote, "In the intervening decade, Cobain, a small, frail but handsome man in life, has become an abstract Generation X icon, viewed by many as the 'last real rock star' [. . .] a messiah and martyr whose every utterance has been plundered and parsed".[100]
In 2005, a sign was put up in Aberdeen, Washington, that read "Welcome to Aberdeen – Come As You Are" as a tribute to Cobain. The sign was paid for and created by the Kurt Cobain Memorial Committee, a non-profit organization created in May 2004 to honor Cobain. The Committee planned to create a Kurt Cobain Memorial Park and a youth center in Aberdeen. Because Cobain was cremated and his remains scattered into the Wishkah River in Washington,[101] many Nirvana fans visit Viretta Park, near Cobain's former Lake Washington home, to pay tribute. On the anniversary of his death, fans gather in the park to celebrate his life and memory.
In 2006, Cobain took the place of Elvis Presley as the top-earning deceased celebrity, after the sale of the Nirvana song catalogue. Presley reclaimed the spot in 2007.[102]
Controversy erupted in July 2009 when a monument to Cobain in Aberdeen along the Wishkah River included the quote "...Drugs are bad for you. They will fuck you up." The city ultimately decided to sandblast the monument to replace the expletive with "f---",[103] but fans immediately drew the letters back in.[104]
Prior to Cobain's death, writer Michael Azerrad published Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana, a book chronicling Nirvana's career from its beginning, as well as the personal histories of the band members. The book explored Cobain's drug addiction, as well as the countless controversies surrounding the band. After Cobain's death, Azerrad re-published the book to include a final chapter discussing the last year of Cobain's life. The book is notable, as it involved the band members themselves, who provided interviews and personal information to Azerrad specifically for the book. In 2006, Azerrad's taped conversations with Cobain were transformed into a documentary about Cobain, titled Kurt Cobain: About a Son. Though this film does not feature any music by Nirvana, it has songs by the artists that inspired Cobain.
In the 1998 documentary Kurt & Courtney, filmmaker Nick Broomfield investigated Tom Grant's claim that Cobain was actually murdered. He took a film crew to visit a number of people associated with Cobain and Love; Love's father, Cobain's aunt, and one of the couple's former nannies. Broomfield also spoke to Mentors bandleader Eldon "El Duce" Hoke, who claimed Love offered him $50,000 to kill Cobain. Although Hoke claimed he knew who killed Cobain, he failed to mention a name, and offered no evidence to support his assertion. Broomfield inadvertently captured Hoke's last interview, as he died days later, reportedly hit by a train. However, Broomfield felt he had not uncovered enough evidence to conclude the existence of a conspiracy. In a 1998 interview, Broomfield summed it up by saying,
"I think that he committed suicide. I don't think there's a smoking gun. And I think there's only one way you can explain a lot of things around his death. Not that he was murdered, but that there was just a lack of caring for him. I just think that Courtney had moved on, and he was expendable."[105]
Broomfield's documentary was noted by The New York Times to be a rambling, largely speculative and circumstantial work, relying on flimsy evidence as was his later documentary Biggie & Tupac.[106]
Journalists Ian Halperin and Max Wallace took a similar path and attempted to investigate any possible conspiracy for themselves. Their initial work, the 1999 book Who Killed Kurt Cobain? argued that, while there was not enough evidence to prove a conspiracy, there was more than enough to demand that the case be reopened.[107] A notable element of the book included their discussions with Grant, who had taped nearly every conversation that he had undertaken while he was in Love's employ. Over the next several years, Halperin and Wallace collaborated with Grant to write a second book, 2004's Love and Death: The Murder of Kurt Cobain.
In 2001, writer Charles R. Cross published a biography of Cobain titled Heavier Than Heaven. For the book, Cross conducted over 400 interviews, and was given access by Courtney Love to Cobain's journals, lyrics, and diaries.[108] Cross' biography was met with criticism, including allegations of Cross accepting secondhand (and incorrect) information as fact.[109] Friend Everett True, who derided the book as being inaccurate, omissive, and highly biased; he said Heavier than Heaven was "the Courtney-sanctioned version of history"[110] or, alternatively, Cross's "Oh, I think I need to find the new Bruce Springsteen now" Kurt Cobain book.[111] However, beyond the criticism, the book contained many details about Cobain and Nirvana's career that would have otherwise been unnoted. Additionally, in 2008 Cross published Cobain Unseen: Mosaic of an Artist, a compilation of annotated photographs and creations and writings by Cobain throughout his life and career.[112] In 2002, a sampling of Cobain's writings was published as Journals. The book fills 280 pages with a simple black cover; the pages are arranged somewhat chronologically (although Cobain generally did not date them). The journal pages are reproduced in color, and there is a section added at the back with explanations and transcripts of some of the less legible pages. The writings begin in the late 1980s and were continued until his death. A paperback version of the book, released in 2003, included a handful of writings that were not offered in the initial release. In the journals, Cobain talked about the ups and downs of life on the road, made lists of what music he was enjoying, and often scribbled down lyric ideas for future reference. Upon its release, reviewers and fans were conflicted about the collection. Many were elated to be able to learn more about Cobain and read his inner thoughts in his own words, but were disturbed by what was viewed as an invasion of his privacy.[113]
Gus Van Sant loosely based his 2005 movie Last Days on the events in the final days of Cobain's life, starring Michael Pitt as Cobain. In January 2007, Courtney Love began to shop the biography Heavier Than Heaven to various movie studios in Hollywood to turn the book into an A-list feature film about Cobain and Nirvana. The video game Guitar Hero 5 features Cobain as a playable character.[114] However, the inclusion of Cobain incensed surviving bandmates Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl and wife Courtney Love, expressing their dismay at the ability to use Cobain with any song, including those sung by female vocalists.[115]
In 2009, ECW Press released a book titled Grunge is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music. Written by Greg Prato, the book explored the history of grunge in detail, touching upon Nirvana and Kurt Cobain's life and death via interviews with former bandmates, friends, and various grunge-era contemporaries. A picture of Cobain from the Bleach era is used for the book's front cover, and its title comes from a shirt that Cobain was once photographed wearing.[116][117][118][119]
In December 2012, during Art Basel exhibition in Miami, artist Adarsha Benjamin presented her experimental short film titled Kurt.[120] Also, there is an upcoming documentary about Cobain to be filmed by director Brett Morgen.[121] Morgen said that documentary "will be this generation's The Wall".[122] It is expected out in 2014.[122]
On April 10, 2014 Nirvana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl along with Courtney Love were on hand.[123][citation needed]

=======================================================
 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Kurt Cobain was born on February 20 1967, in Aberdeen, Washington. Kurt and his family lived in Hoquiam for the first few months of his life then later moved back to Aberdeen, where he had a happy childhood until his parents divorced. The divorce left Kurt's outlook on the world forever scarred. He became withdrawn and anti-social. He was constantly placed with one relative to the next, living with friends, and at times even homeless. Kurt was not the most popular person in high school as he was in public school. In 1985 Kurt left Aberdeen for Olympia where he formed the band Nirvana in 1986. In 1989 Nirvana recorded their debut album Bleach under the independent label Sub-Pop records. Nirvana became very popular in Britain and by 1991 they signed a contract with Geffen. Their next album Nevermind became a 90s masterpiece and made Kurt's Nirvana one of the most successful bands in the world. Kurt became trampled upon with success and found the new lifestyle hard to bear. In February 1992 Kurt married Courtney Love, the woman who was already pregnant with his child, Frances Bean Cobain. Nirvana released their next album Incesticide later that year. The album appealed to many fans due to the liner notes, which expressed Kurt's open-mindedness. In September 1993 Nirvana released their next album, 'In Utero', which topped the charts. On March 4, 1994, Kurt was taken to hospital in a coma. It was officially stated as an accident but many believe it to have been an unsuccessful suicide attempt. Family and friends convinced Kurt to seek rehab. Kurt was said to have fled rehab after only a few days from a missing person's report filed by Courtney Love. On April 8th Kurt's body was found in his Seattle home. In his arms was a shotgun, which had been fired into his head. Near him laid a suicide note written in red ink. It was addressed to his wife Courtney Love and his daughter Frances Bean Cobain. Two days after Kurt's body was discovered people gathered in Seattle, they began setting fires, chanting profanities, and fighting with police officers. They also listened to a tape of Courtney reading sections of the suicide note left by Kurt. The last few words were "I love you, I love you".
      Ashes were scattered in McLane Creek in Olympia, Washington. A handful were scattered under the willow at the front of 171 Lake Washinton Boulevard in Seattle, and another handful was given to a Buddhist to make a "tsatsu" (a memorial sculpture).
      Although Cobain's death was officially ruled a suicide, certain aspects about his death have led to speculation that he was murdered: He had entirely too much heroin in his system at the time of his death to have been able to operate a shotgun; he would have been incapacitated within seconds of injecting it. Also, the so-called "suicide note" may have been a letter to his fans expressing his desire to quit both Nirvana and the music business altogether. In addition, one of Cobain's credit cards was being used a few days AFTER his death.
      After his death, many musicians recorded tribute songs to him. Some of the better known of these include R.E.M.'s "Let Me In", Patti Smith's "About a Boy", Neil Young's "Sleeps with Angels", and Cher's "The Fall".
      His songs have been covered by Tori Amos, Sinéad O'Connor, Herbie Hancock, and Branford Marsalis.
      His most famous song, "Smells Like Teen Spirit", was voted by Rolling Stone Magazine and MTV as the 3rd best pop song out of 100 of all time.
      According to his widow, Courtney Love, Cobain left behind 109 unreleased, recorded songs when he died in 1994. Some are just song fragments, some music "collages", and about eight are acoustic numbers that Love deems good enough for release. One song, "Stinking of You", which he wrote with Love, includes the line "Stinking of you...I don't care if my life is shattered, it's my point of view..."
      His most popular songs include "About a Girl", "Been a Son", "Negative Creep", "Aneurysm", "Dive", "Sliver", "Smells Like Teen Spirit", "Lithium", "In Bloom", "Polly", "Something in the Way", "Heart-Shaped Box", "Rape Me", "Dumb", "Pennyroyal Tea", "All Apologies" and "You Know You're Right" (written and recorded shortly before his death but not officially released until October 2002).
      The Nirvana song "Scentless Apprentice" is based on a book called "Perfume" by Patrick Süskind.
      Recent biography is written by Charles Cross, an influential icon in the Seattle music scene. The biography, "Heavier Than Heaven", is said to be the most comprehensive biography of one of the most mysterious artists in music history.
      Played a trick on the MTV brass when he began Nirvana's appearance at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards by playing the first few chords of the song "Rape Me" and singing the first verse. He then quickly switched to playing "Lithium", the song the band had agreed to play in the show as a compromise with MTV executives. Cobain had wanted to sing the then-new song "Rape Me", while MTV's bigwigs wanted the band to lead off the show with their signature song, "Smells Like Teen Spirit". The two sides settled on a mid-show rendition of "Lithium".
      Samples of Cobain-penned song lyrics: "I'm a negative creep and I'm stoned" ("Negative Creep," 1989)... "She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart" ("Aneurysm," 1990)... "And I forget just why I taste/oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile/I found it hard, it's hard to find/oh well, whatever, nevermind" ("Smells Like Teen Spirit," 1991)... "My heart is broke/but I have some glue/help me inhale/and mend it with you/we'll float around/and hang out on clouds/then we'll come down/and have a hangover" ("Dumb," 1993)... "I'll keep fighting jealousy/until it's fucking gone" ("Lounge Act," 1991)... "The animals I've trapped/have all become my pets" ("Something in the Way," 1991)... "Things have never been so swell/I have never failed to feel pain" ("You Know You're Right," 1994)... "All in all is all we all are" ("All Apologies," 1993).
      Was runner-up for Best Songwriter of 1994 in "Rolling Stone" magazine's annual critics' poll. He ranked between Freedy Johnston and Sam Phillips, who placed 1st and 3rd in the poll, respectively.
      Despite the rumors, there is no evidence or documentation suggesting that Cobain was in the process of divorcing Courtney Love at the time of his death. In fact, it was Love who staged an intervention for Cobain to get him to enter a drug rehab clinic just prior to his death. When Cobain escaped the facility, Love sent investigators to track him down, but by the time they found him, it was too late.
      He wrote a song for his friend Mark Lanegan, who sang for the Screaming Trees. The song was never recorded because Mark said not only would it be like digging up the grave of an old friend, but the song simply didn't fit with the rest of the "Dust" album in a lyrical sense.
Cher composed the song "The Fall", after learning about his suicide. The song is included on her album "Not.Comm.ercial", which was for sale only on the Internet.
      Daughter Frances Bean Cobain looks almost exactly like him. She has the distinct blue eyes, and nose.
      Posthumous album "Nirvana: MTV Unplugged" earned he and Nirvana a 1995 Grammy. It was the only Grammy they won.
      His songs have been covered by bands ranging from Evanescence to hard rock supergroup Velvet Revolver to female Japanese duo Cibo Matto.
      His 3 favorite films are Paris, Texas (1984), - as stated on the "Nevermind - It's An Interview" CD; Over the Edge (1979); and Rear Window (1954).
      Suffered chronic stomach pain from stomach ulcers and back pain from scoliosis (curvature of the spine).
      Son of Donald Cobain and Wendy Fradenburg. Grandson of Leland Cobain and Iris Cobain née LaBrot and Charles Fradenburg and Peggy Fradenburg née Irving. His parents married in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho on July 31, 1965. They had a son and a daughter while they were married to each other. Kurt, born February 20, 1967 and Kimberly, born on April 24, 1970. They divorced in 1976.
      "Thank you all from the pit of my burning, nauseous stomach for your letters of concern over the past years. I don't have the passion anymore and so remember, it's better to burn out than fade away" (addressed to Nirvana fans in his suicide note).
      Has been voted as "the greatest rock'n'roll hero of all time" by the readers of "NME" magazine (10 May 2006).
      Said he eventually wanted to experiment with filmmaking. He even wrote a script for a horror movie.
      Surpassed Elvis Presley to become the world's top-earning dead celebrity. He raked in £26.3 million from beyond the grave during 2006, according to US business website Forbes.com.
      Very frequently changed up the words or the order of lines or verses of his songs when performing them live, rarely if every singing them the same from show to show.
      One of the last songs he ever recorded was entitled "I Hate Myself and Want to Die." It was released on the "Beavis and Butt-Head Experience" compilation album.
      "Bleach", the first Nirvana album, spells his first name as "Kurdt". All subsequent releases use the more familiar "Kurt".
      In a 2008 NME magazine interview, Courtney Love claimed that Cobain turned down the role of Lance in Pulp Fiction (1994). The part was eventually taken by Eric Stoltz.
      Died at 27 years old, making him a member of the "27 Club"; The 27 Club is a group of prominent musicians who died at the age of 27. Other members include Rolling Stones co-founder Brian Jones, guitarist Jimi Hendrix, singer Janis Joplin, The Doors frontman Jim Morrison and Amy Winehouse.
      His body was discovered on April 8, 1994 - a day on which he was originally scheduled to perform at the Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland.
      His death was similar to that of Kenny MacLean and Layne Staley in that nobody found him until 3 days after he died.
      [To 'Weird Al" Yankovic', when asked for permission to do a parody of "Smells Like Teen Spirit"] "It isn't going to be about food, is it?".
      "I stared into his eyes and told him that I thought he was a respectable human. I did tell him straight out that I think his band still sucks." - on his encounter with Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder.
      When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily I should have been in that band - or at least in a Pixies cover band.
      I didn't know how to deal with success. If there was a Rock Star 101, I would have liked to take it. It might have helped me.
      It just so happens that there's a bunch of people that are concerned with what I have to say. I find that frightening at times because I'm just as confused as most people.
      [on his Irish ancestry] They came from County Cork, which is a really weird coincidence, because when we toured Ireland, we played in Cork and the entire day I walked around in a daze. I'd never felt more spiritual in my life. It was the weirdest feeling and I have a friend who was with me who could testify to this. I was almost in tears the whole day. Since that tour, which was about two years ago, I've had a sense that I was from Ireland.

Kurt Cobain's life and legacy: A conversation with biographer Charles R. Cross | The Music Mix | EW.com
Twenty years ago, we lost Kurt Cobain. Few singular stars were as deeply influential as the Nirvana frontman, who smashed apart the otherness of the rock star persona and made it a more egalitarian pursuit. 
No two Nirvana albums were ever alike, and it seemed like Cobain’s musical horizons were continuing to expand when he left us. His approach to singing, his songwriting style, and his band’s shifting dynamics so permeated rock radio that there seemed to be an entire subgenre of hit-making bands (Bush, Silverchair, Sponge, and the like) who seemed to exist solely as Nirvana avatars.
But as time marches on, Cobain’s influence is harder to detect in 2014. As a part of EW’s exploration of what Kurt Cobain’s music might have sounded like had he made it out of ’94, I sat down with journalist Charles R. Cross, author of definitive Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven and the recently-released Here We Are Now: The Lasting Impact of Kurt Cobain.
Cross: You hear him on most every act on alternative rock radio. The way you hear Kurt today is you hear squealing guitars, which were never on any radio station except college radio. Bruce Springsteen in the ’80s didn’t have guitar that was going in and out of phase. The metal of that era didn’t have it. And Kurt’s not the only person who did that. It’s easy to look at him because of his oversize shadow, and in this book I didn’t want to attribute too much to him. He’s not the only one that gets credit for the way music has shifted. I hear him in guitar sounds, and I hear him in the loud-soft dynamic. If there was anything that was trademarked by Nirvana’s sound, it was that. Led Zeppelin did it, but they did it in a nine minute rock song that had an acoustic segment, and they didn’t do it with songs on pop radio. In pop radio, when you hear a chorus that comes in all gangbusters and a verse that is much quieter and then that smash—that’s Nirvana. The song that does that clearest is the last song they ever recorded, which was “You Know You’re Right.” It’s quiet and then it’s a powerhouse. If that’s what they were doing the last time they were in the studio, to some degree that becomes the echo that is still heard.
That’s an argument I make in the book, about lyrical content and what songs can cover. That is dramatically different than it was 25 years ago in music. You can write a song about your own internal dialogue. Pop radio did not touch that. I don’t think people sit down and write in the style of Kurt Cobain, but that whole thing has shifted. Even looking at Lorde’s “Royals,” I can’t imagine that coming out in 1988. Pop music can be about an internal dialogue in the voice of the singer. Kurt didn’t invent that, but he transformed it and brought it into the pop landscape in a way that no one else had done in a long time.
The thing that most surprised me was the impact on hip-hop, which I was not aware of. That’s the impact of MTV and music videos and the VMAs. He became a cultural figure, like Al Pacino in Scarface. He became an image on a t-shirt, and people who didn’t grow up with the music see him as a representative of violence or suicide or general f—ed-upness or drug addiction or music. He becomes this time marker for a whole generation. At times, we look at music through racial blinders, and if Kurt can be influenced by Lead Belly, then why can’t a young black hip-hop artist be influenced by Kurt? Because he was the biggest and most influential rock artist of his time, in a crazy way, he becomes the biggest rock influence on hip-hop. “Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I’m bored and old.” That could be the lyric to a hip-hop song. Very few people were putting a personal story in the first person in rock music in that era. To some degree, hip-hop always was confessional, but Kurt helped bring the idea of lyrical confession to the mainstream.
Let’s talk about Kurt’s relationship with other people’s music. Was he the type of guy who was always searching for new records?
Absolutely not. There are 20,000 people in Brooklyn today whose music collection and their input on what they found today is more than what Kurt found his entire career. What’s interesting is he was interested in things, but what went into that petri dish of his musical creativity was only a few things, and they were sort of random. He stumbles upon the Knack record. He meets the Melvins and gets to know them and hears a few records that Buzz Osborne gives him, like Slayer. So these things start to come in to him, but it’s only a few things. But the things he found that he loved, he really loved: The Vaselines, the Pixies. He loved those bands so much, more than he probably should have to some degree. He got something out of all those. Let’s say Kurt had 10 major influences, but he got something from every one of those influences. Now we’re in the era where musicians can go to iTunes and be exposed to millions of recordings without ever leaving a computer. But there’s so much out there that the ability to for one band or album to have an impact on you becomes diminished. So someone tells Kurt to listen to the Beatles, and he gets into Meet The Beatles, and that directly inspires “About a Girl,” and to some degree the pop influence that stretches through Nevermind. That one record has so much more influence on his career than any record will ever have on the National or Coldplay.
Do you think Kurt would be able to function better now, with technology making all aspects of the music business much easier?
It’s very hard to make of what Kurt Cobain would have done in the era of iTunes. I still think he would have been the same. I think he still would have gone to record stores and swap meets. There’s a sense of discovery to it, and that was part of what he was after. I don’t think people can even begin to understand that. When Kurt was young, one of the first records he ever bought was REO Speedwagon. He had to get his aunt to pick him up and drive him from where he lived in Aberdeen to Seattle, which was a long drive. Then he had to hunt through all the used record stores in the University District to find this REO Speedwagon album at a price he could afford, which would have been only one or two dollars. I grew up in that era, and some of my best friends worked at those stores. It’s crazy to think that one of my friends might have sold an REO Speedwagon album to a 14-year-old kid who eight years later would release Nevermind.

Heavier Than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain by Charles R. Cross — Reviews, Discussion, Bookclubs, Lists

The art of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain was all about his private life, but written in a code as obscure as T.S. Eliot's. Now Charles Cross has cracked the code in the definitive biography Heavier Than Heaven, an all-access pass to Cobain's heart and mind. It reveals many secrets, thanks to 400-plus interviews, and even quotes Cobain's diaries and suicide notes and reveals an unreleased Nirvana masterpiece. At last we know how he created, how lies helped him die, how his family and love life entwined his art--plus, what the heck "Smells Like Teen Spirit" really means. (It was graffiti by Bikini Kill's Kathleen Hanna after a double date with Dave Grohl, Cobain, and the "over-bored and self-assured" Tobi Vail, who wore Teen Spirit perfume; Hanna wrote it to taunt the emotionally clingy Cobain for wearing Vail's scent after sex--a violation of the no-strings-attached dating ethos of the Olympia, Washington, "outcast teen" underground. Cobain's stomach-churning passion for Vail erupted in six or so hit tunes like "Aneurysm" and "Drain You.")   Cross uncovers plenty of news, mostly grim and gripping. As a teen, Cobain said he had "suicide genes," and his clan was peculiarly defiant: one of his suicidal relatives stabbed his own belly in front of his family, then ripped apart the wound in the hospital. Cobain was contradictory: a sweet, popular teen athlete and sinister berserker, a kid who rescued injured pigeons and laughingly killed a cat, a talented yet astoundingly morbid visual artist. He grew up to be a millionaire who slept in cars (and stole one), a fiercely loyal man who ruthlessly screwed his oldest, best friends. In fact, his essence was contradictions barely contained. Cross, the coauthor of Nevermind: Nirvana, the definitive book about the making of the classic album, puts numerous Cobain-generated myths to rest. (Cobain never lived under a bridge--that Aberdeen bridge immortalized in the 12th song on Nevermind was a tidal slough, so nobody could sleep under it.) He gives the fullest account yet of what it was like to be, or love, Kurt Cobain. Heavier Than Heaven outshines the also indispensable Come As You Are. It's the deepest book about pop's darkest falling star. --Tim Appelo (less)

I just noticed the average rating for this book was 4 stars. Yuck. The author does a decent job putting together Kurt Cobains' life and rise to fame. In the last chapters he takes "creative license" in describing Kurts' last moments, all the way to his suicide. It's disgusting. No one was there (that we know of). He has no right. 
This booked disturbed me a bit. I know everyone wants to rape the corpse of Cobain but not me and admitting this is embarrassing but hey, we're all friends here. Reading it I saw a lot of myself in Kurt Cobain and it worried me. Am I going to blow my brains out? I certainly hope not. Maybe I related to him in the way that a lot of people did. Maybe he's just a common guy who was thrown into something bigger than him. At any rate Charles Cross really did his research and created a book that I ate...more

The author speaks in most of the Kurt Cobain & Nirvana documentories ive seen. I sending u this after reading a particular sentence in your review (blow my brains out) please check out the website www.cobaincase.com. Tom Grant a private investigator created the website after being hired by Courtney Love to investigate someone using Kurts credit card. This was days before he was found dead. Tom Grant started investigating kurt's death after all the suspicious events. After reading the information on the site u may feel different. Theres live recordings with courtney love also. Cobaincase.com/events is the section on the site that made me think twice about his death.(less)
this book is almost equal parts fiction and Courtney Love approved versions of "actual events." it gives some information, but it should be taken with a grain of salt. there are TONS of proven historical errors. i don't blame the author for the misinformation, however, as he had to have everything cleared by Courtney Love. he did lose his credibility, though. i can't believe they used him on "busted circuits and ringing ears: the TAD story" dvd that came out a year ago. if you are a Nirvana fan,...more

Cross takes a LOT of liberties in describing Kurt's final moments. as a guy who doesn't quite buy the "Kurt killed himself by shooting himself in the head after he took a LEATHAL dose of heroin and THEN somehow managed to put all of his paraphernalia away in it's box, THEN take the shotgun, (that had NO fingerprints on it) put it in his mouth and pull the trigger," story, i can't help but feel like this book makes me feel like i'm being lied to.(less)
Kurt Cobain was a constant whiner and self-mythogist who constantly complained that fame was thrust upon him.  Cross spends the first half of the biography debunking the Cobain myths and demonstrating how heavily Kurt courted mainstream success.  The second half of the book documents Cobain's downward spiral- it's really amazing that he had to kill himself with a shotgun when he got so close so many times with his "heroine."

Baru selesai baca kemarin malam. Akhirnya selesai juga baca kisah si motornya Nirvana ini :D. Meski yang gua baca itu versi terjemahan bahasa Indonesianya, kayaknya gua pengen beli juga yang versi aslinya.Bytheway. Buku ini cukup rinci nyeritain kisah hidup Kurt Cobain. Tentu beserta Nirvana n keluarganya. Pokoknya semua yang dirasa pernah ada hubungan dengan Kurt, dituangkan secara kronologis di buku ini. Si penulisnya melakukan 400 wawancara selama empat taun dengan orang-orang yang pernah bersinggungan jalan dengan jalan hidup Kurt, sebelum buku ini akhirnya jadi. Jadi ya setidaknya buku ini bisa lah dijadiin gambaran awal mengenai kisah kehidupan Kurt.Gua sendiri selagi dan setelah baca buku ini jadi ngerasa kasian sama Kurt. Ternyata ada orang yang begitu merasa kesepian. Padahal dia rockstar tenar. Banyak anak muda yang menjadikannya pahlawan. Banyak fans-nya yang begitu 'look-up to him'. Tapi kok ya itu semua ga ngebantu dia keluar dari masalahnya: drugs. Padahal ga sedikit yang mencintai dia, meski dengan cara mereka masing-masing -yang bisa dibilang rada aneh juga.Buat yang ngaku fans berat Kurt Cobain (dan otomatis Nirvana juga -lu ga bisa nyebut Kurt Cobain tanpa Nirvana, dan sebaliknya), buku ini harus dibaca! Ambil sisi postifnya, buang jauh-jauh sisi negatifnya -yang banyak itu. Jadiin buku ini sebagai satu pelajaran: jangan pernah, JANGAN PERNAH sekali pun -bahkan untuk coba-coba- make narkoba! GA ADA gunanya sama sekali.Satu lagi: jangan bunuh diri. Dosa :D. Apapun masalah yang lu hadapi, seberat apapun masalah yang lu pikul, masih ada Tuhan yang bakal nolong kita kalo kita bener-bener berusaha dan berdoa. Tuhan kita baik, kok :-) percaya, deh.Tambahan: Ternyata, kematian Kurt masih dipertanyakan: bunuh diri atau dibunuh? :-)(less)
I saw Nirvana in concert 4 months before Cobain took his life. After hundreds of live shows it still stands as one of my all time favorites. In fact it was the first concert I ever crowd-surfed at. I was able to get up close and personal with the band and, in doing so, saw that Kurt rarely looked up at the crowd. His eyes were glued to the floor most of the night.

I saw Nirvana in concert 4 months before Cobain took his life. After hundreds of live shows it still stands as one of my all time favorites. In fact it was the first concert I ever crowd-surfed at. I was able to get up close and personal with the band and, in doing so, saw that Kurt rarely looked up at the crowd. His eyes were glued to the floor most of the night. This book helped me to understand why. Given his recurrent heroin addiction, the debilitating stomach pain he'd fought for years, the constant fighting with Courtney, and his unhappiness with fame I can imagine that Kurt felt a pretty heavy burden on his shoulders during those years.That being said I feel like Kurt's style of thinking only contributed to his misery. This book isn't just a treatise on the life of Cobain. It is a psychological profile of Kurt Cobain; lifting the hood over the engine and taking a look at all the rusty gears and the worn out spark plugs. Cross does an amazing job of truly understanding the way Cobain thought. As much as I idolized Kurt for most of my teenage and college years I now see that Cobain's style of thinking was as someone who saw himself as an innocent victim and he tended to be a bit paranoid. While many American kids experience the divorce of their parents most are able to put it in context at some point in their lives. Cobain never got over his parents divorce and saw his father's subsequent marriage as a betrayal; that dad was kicking Kurt out of his life. I'm sure that losing this relationship was sad but most of us would be able to develop enough understanding to move past it. For Kurt this sadness simply shifted in to anger and pushing his father away. This was the start of a "victim mentality" that never seemed to go away. I see Kurt's victimhood as his biggest failing and something that set the stage for later victimhood.Ultimately, I developed a love/hate relationship with this book. While it was impeccably researched and extremely intriguing I felt really sad by the time I finished it. I developed a lot of empathy for Kurt throughout the reading and was devastated by the end of the book to think of all of that amazing talent wasted through suicide. Very sad indeed.(less)
Interesting fact No. 1: KC's first concert was not the Melvins or some such punk band, but Sammy Hagar, who has shown surprisingly restraint in not naming a brand of tequila after the now-Converse branded icon. That's just one reason why this book about The Voice of Your Generation is valuable: it's proof that no one is born punk or even cool, but that it's an attitude one accrues by hanging around the right crowd.

That's why the real heroines here aren't named Courtney but first girlfriend Tracy Marander and Bikini Kill drummer Tobi Vail, from whom KC learned most of his sexual politics.I agree with the GoodReader who said this bio's strongest in the early years where a lot of the mythology is parsed. Toward the end it just gets sad---i.e. the home movie of Kurt and Courtney bathing the baby with a syringe in the background hanging on the toothbrush rack.I sense a big revisionary wave coming on about Nirvana. Twenty years later the music still socks a punch but there seems a need out there to make it seem far less meaningful than it did from 91-94. That's too bad, because it really was, musically, an exciting time... probably the only time my generation felt like a community (even if everybody was denying there was such a thing as a generational identity). In the end, it would have been much more compelling to watch KC mature (that dreaded word) and become a survivor that to have to bear all the black velvet tributes. I guess that's why, as often as I've thumbed through the initial third of this bio, I've never been motivated to reread it to the end. The story didn't need to end this way, and only the show-bizzers get any pleasure out of it.(less)

I published this on a music blog group called Future Rockstars of American (which is now dead I think): I finished reading the biography of Kurt Cobain, Heavier Than Heaven written by Charles Cross, just in time for what would have been his 41st birthday. My conclusion?Kurdt (that’s how he liked to spell it) was a jerk!Cortney Love had the crowd call him worse things when she read his suicide note to them.I was not an active and avid fan of Nirvana when their singer Kurt Cobain killed glam rock with his nonsensical screams and pop structured punk grunge tunes. I liked their music though, and I remember wondering,“Why is he singing about girl’s deoderant?”As I listen to the Nirvana albums today, I realize that I know practically every song. I guess you can’t be a teen in the early nineties and escape the impact Nirvana had on that generation.I try to imagine what I would have done if the idol of my own teen years, Tori Amos, had committed suicide while I was in the midst of using her music and voice as a resonator for my young soul. I would probably have sobbed in grief silently under my bed covers with her album on repeat, or maybe I would have smashed her cds on the street in effigy at the betrayal. Whatever the physical actions, I know for sure that the piercing and torturous scream in my head would have been:“WHY?! WHY?! WHY?! WHY?! WHY?!….”That’s exactly what Courtney Love screamed as she waded her hands in the blood of her beloved dead husband and saved a piece of his shotgun shattered skull. His suicide was simply a pattern that he had repeated his whole life since his mother left his father when he was 7 years old. Before that event, he was a little boy that didn’t want to sleep because he didn’t want to leave his family. After that, he was a self-destructing, relationship sabotaging jerk.To be fair, Kurdt wasn’t all bad.He was an animal lover who took in strays and loved having a bathtub full of turtles in the middle of his dwelling. His home always smelled like the bottom of a litter tray.He was incredibly respectful of women, more feminist than the feminist punker girl love interest that “Smells Like Teen Spirit” was written about. His song “Polly” is as poignant a song about rape as Tori Amos’s “Me and A Gun (and a man on my back).”He really, really loved his parents and sister, which is why he reacted so strongly to the breaking of his idyllic home life. He cared deeply for his grandparents and other relatives.He really, deeply, truly loved his wife and daughter. Why else would he name his albums In Utero the year after his marriage and daughter’s birth?Though a drug addict, he called Courtney and cried when drug addicts worshipped him at a concert. He couldn’t stand being an icon for drug use.Kurdt was charismatic, drawing people into his life with his sincere kindness and empathy as well as the siren song of his art.But he was a control freak. He would create something real and genuine then quickly destroy it himself before someone else could. It was his way of protecting himself from loss. He broke everything precious to him the way he smashed his guitars. He had attempted suicide multiple times.As I read the biography, I had thought that I would become so invested in its main character that I would be very sad for him when he died. Unexpectedly, there were three other moments instead that were intensely painful to vicariously witness. First was a short conversation he had with his estranged father where they actually exchanged an awkward and heartfelt “I love you.” Then there was the moment when he held his daughter for the last time and whispered into her ear before he went off to kill himself. Finally, there was Cortney’s reaction to his death. She had covered herself in layers of his clothes that still had the lingering scent of his body. Like all deaths, it’s the ones left behind that suffer.Cross did a great job allowing readers a glimpse into Cobain’s life and mind. I’m a bigger fan of Nirvana after reading the book. As I read his descrīption of Kurdt in the actual act of suicide, the image of him abandoning family, friends, and millions of adoring fans who had linked their hearts and souls with his caused me to whisper under my breath:“How could you?”Granted it wasn’t like all of his family, friends, and fans were perfect people, but it is heartbreaking to see so many hearts break.(less)

"How could you?"  You really might want to read up on Major Depressive Disorder and mental illness in general. Some neurologists now want to categorize major depression as a neurological disease whose symptoms are psychiatric. This is because of major, visible changes to the brain itself clearly visible on MRI scans of people with MDD. Certain areas of the depressed brain simply do not and cannot physically work the way a "normal" brain can. Suicide is a reaction to this brain state. I can tell you that no one with MDD wants to die--but they do want to be out of constant and excruciating pain. That is how he, and countless others, commit suicide, in invariably violent ways, completely alone, every year. To say that those afflicted with MDD are somehow killing themselves because their family, friends and fans are imperfect is to greatly misunderstand not only the major disease state of the patient, but to greatly insult that person themselves. Depression remains one of the only diseases wherein people can blame the victim and even assassinate his or her character for his or her own death, as if there was truly the choice that anyone with normal brain function has. That is simply untrue, scientifically and actually. The fact that Cobain, and indeed anyone, had lived with MDD since childhood and survived it to age 27 could be looked upon as something of a miracle in itself. For more information, please visit the National Institute for Mental Health's website @ www.nimh.org.(less)
Good info. I personally know someone who suffered from MDD and has died because of it.  Important to educate people about this serious disease.

I had read Michael Azerad's "Come as You Are," the story of Nirvana way back in the day so I knew quite a bit about Kurt's life and the history of the band. This went a lot deeper and was compiled of many sources, family members and friends of the band and was a lot more true to life. Michael Azerad's book was based on interviews with the band, so it was mostly how the band wanted to portray themselves. This book made me decide that if I had known Kurt I would have thought him a lazy, self-absorbed butthead. Although he was an amazing artist. It was detailed, sad, and honest. My boyfriend Patt thought that the author came off as a little too idolizing of Kurt, but I didn't see that as much. Overall I would recommend it, there are probably many other biographies out there about Kurt but this one would most likely be the best. (less)
Don't tell Patt, but I wasn't that impressed by Kurt Cobain, however  I'm only human and would be interested to read this. Can I borrow your copy?

Personally, I feel as if this biography was somewhat heavily edited and overseen by Courtney Love. Cross seemed to have left out interviews with people like Dave Grohl who was at one time, closer to Kurt than anyone, with the exception of Krist Noveselic and Love. However, I do not agree that Kurt is a lazy self-absorbed butthead; I believe Kurt was so dedicated to music that simply doing anything else was just not possible as all Kurt wanted to do is play the guitar and write music. Also, from what I have read about Kurt he seemed to have a low sense of self worth. Although, I do not agree with everything in this book as the last days of Cobain's life are still to this day mysterious, I still think it is an essential read for any Nirvana/ Kurt Cobain fan.(less)
Hmmmm... well, I don't read a lot of biographies.  I didn't know a lot about Kurt Cobain even though I am a Nirvana fan.  The book was interesting and the author seemed to have interviewed and researched a lot of facts.  Mostly what I took from this book is that Kurt was a complex person plagued with self doubt, physical pain, issues of abandonment and a family history of mental illness.  Oh and he made a conscious decision to be a drug addict.  And, wow, did he do a lot of drugs.The parts about the...more

Oh and he made a conscious decision to be a drug addict.  And, wow, did he do a lot of drugs.The parts about the song writing/lyrics were very interesting and made me want to get out those Nirvana Cds and listen to them with the context given by the book.I question some parts about Courtney Love.  The author made her seem like the more stable of the two.  Which seeing what a mess she has been in recent years, I just question the way the author portrayed her in the book.  I think the author took a lot of liberties with the end and the suicide.  Overall it was an interesting book.  If you are a Nirvana fan, I'd say read it, but I wouldn't say this book is THE authority on Cobain.  I might read some of the other biographies out there to compare.(less)
I enjoyed this book until I got to the last chapter. Like a couple of other reviews state, the author makes it feel like Kurt is a character in a fictional story. I am absolutely fascinated by his life. The book is packed with details that left me astounded.

I enjoyed this book until I got to the last chapter. Like a couple of other reviews state, the author makes it feel like Kurt is a character in a fictional story. I am absolutely fascinated by his life. The book is packed with details that left me astounded. While reading, I kept a browser open on my computer because there was always something I wanted to look into or a video to search. The author did a brilliant job of describing specific scenes and pictures, I really wish more of the pictures he described would have been included in this book. The final chapter, however, surrounding the events around his death had me pretty upset. The author describes in great detail what Kurt did alone in his house and what he was thinking ... Why he did what he did. There is no way for the author to know this.  It is unfair for the author to assume many of the things written, especially since Kurt is not here to defend himself. We will never know what was going through his head and I'm okay with that. I'm pissed that the author tried to fill that space with an assumed story. We can all make assumptions based on his journal entries and interviews, but that's all it is .... An assumption, a feeling .... Not fact. (less)
It is a bit of a cliche of celebrity, but Kurt Cobain really was an incredibly contradictory personality. Part of the fun of Heavier Than Heaven is trying to take all of the evidence, presented in amazing detail by Charles R. Cross, and trying to piece together what kind of person he was.As anyone casually familiar with Cobain knows, he was constantly trying to strike a balance between his strong punk sense of morality and his desire to get his music out to a large audience.

It is a bit of a cliche of celebrity, but Kurt Cobain really was an incredibly contradictory personality. Part of the fun of Heavier Than Heaven is trying to take all of the evidence, presented in amazing detail by Charles R. Cross, and trying to piece together what kind of person he was.As anyone casually familiar with Cobain knows, he was constantly trying to strike a balance between his strong punk sense of morality and his desire to get his music out to a large audience. Deeper than just a creative marketing ploy, Cobain seemed genuinely torn between stardom and artistic integrity. This can be seen in the way it effected him in not only his professional life but his private life as well. Cobain seemed to always be a best friend or a bitter rival, with little in between. He hated being a junky but couldn't live without heroin.Fans of Cobain are faced with a similar conundrum. It was this delicate balance between the two worlds that made the music great; music with an edge and a palatable emotional intensity that was at the same time accessable and catchy. It perfectly straddled the line between ugly and beautiful, melodious and dischordant, gentle and rough.But at the same time these opposing forces ended up destroying him. Trying to pin down a single reason, or single instance that lead to his death would be futile. The closest we can come is saying that his inner confusion and self-loathing became too much. Fans have to deal with the fact that what made his music great is what killed him, and decide what that means to us when we listen.(less)

I agree that it is fun trying to take pieces of every article or novel about Cobain and put together what type of person he was. However after having read Cobain's journals it definitely seems that Kurt was a walking contradiction, but that is what makes him so great. It seems that with every musician that hits it big there is always the struggle of trying to remain true to your original music but trying to appeal to the mainstream. Although with their album "In Utero" Cobain somewhat challenged all of Nirvana's "fans". I expected this novel to give a really good account of Kurt and his final days however, after reading it I am somewhat disappointed as it seems a lot is left out. Perhaps it was edited or there really is just barely anything known about what Kurt truly did before his death. All in all I still liked this novel as I am an avid Nirvana fan and it is a definite must read for all other Nirvana/ Kurt Cobain fans.(less)
Well, now I'm obsessed.  To be totally objective, I was hovering on the obsession line for a while.

Well, now I'm obsessed.  To be totally objective, I was hovering on the obsession line for a while.  I love Nirvana, and Kurt Cobain specifically, so when I picked up Heavier Than Heaven, I thought I'd just get a better understanding of the subject.Newp.   Not so easy.  This book reads like a novel.  It sucks you in, chomps down on your guts with shark jaws, shakes you around, and then suddenly releases you into the calm black depths of total obsession.   This portrait of Kurt Cobain is not objective.   Of course.   But I found the point of view agreeable; it seemed to reinforce my idea of Cobain's internal workings.  There were one or two parts where I could practically hear Courtney Love screaming her editorial suggestions in the background.   These parts were just slightly too favorable to her.  For instance, when Courtney Love told Vogue that she did heroin while she was pregnant.   When Frances was born, she was taken away from her parents for several long weeks.  There is a quote about the anti-drug culture that cracked me up because it was so absurd: that there was a "mistaken impression" that one could not be a heroin addict and a good parent.    No, sorry, Courtney, it isn't a mistaken impression.  If you're doing heroin while pregnant, you're by definition not a fit parent.In any case, I was very happy when they got Frances back; the love both parents had for the child was evident.   The loving commitment and the perfect fit between Kurt and Courtney also surprised me - in many ways they reminded me of Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes because they borrowed each other's lines, sang each other's songs, and seemed to be deeply compatible.  The artistic symbiotic relationship was the hallmark of the Plath-Hughes union.  It was a pleasure to read about another similar relationship.The author takes a few liberties at the very last of the book; he could not possibly know Cobain's tortured thoughts while he pondered while shooting up and then holding the gun to his mouth.  But man, when he did pull the trigger, the words on the page scorched me to the bone, and I wept.  I wept for the sweet boy Cobain was, the brilliant artist, the husband and father.   I wept because it was a shame to lose it all. And I wept because, like Plath, I believe that it was inevitable.   A date with destiny.This was a moving, illuminating book.   Anyone who loves stories about complex, complicated artists will appreciate it.  Those who already like Cobain will be seduced -- then obsessed.(less)
Biography of Kurt Cobain:A Troubled Genius	Is fame a blessing or a curse? Many people wonder what it is like to be famous. Kurt Cobain doesn’t need to. One of the themes most prevalent throughout the Biography of Kurt Cobain was that you can achieve almost anything if you keep at it.

Biography of Kurt Cobain:A Troubled Genius	Is fame a blessing or a curse? Many people wonder what it is like to be famous. Kurt Cobain doesn’t need to. One of the themes most prevalent throughout the Biography of Kurt Cobain was that you can achieve almost anything if you keep at it. You can achieve almost anything because Kurt’s record tops the charts, he becomes famous worldwide, and he never listened to anyone who said he couldn’t do it.	You can achieve almost anything if you really try because Kurt’s record goes number one. As the text says, “And then, as if things weren’t turbulent enough, the news came that in the next issue of Billboard magazine, Nevermind would hit the No. 1 spot, pushing out Michael Jackson’s Dangerous.” Nirvana’s album was the biggest in the U.S. at one point. Kurt Cobain went from not being able to afford gas money to being the biggest artist in the United States. He was making money and was extremely successful. If someone who was born poor and dropped out of high school can become a rock star, then many other people can do big things if they just keep trying.	Another reason you can achieve almost anything is that Kurt became famous worldwide. This was proved when one of Kurt’s old friends said, “You’re really famous now, Cobain. You’re on TV, like, every three hours.” To be on TV at all is not that common. Every few hours means that you really are very famous and successful. To become that famous is a very low chance. Out of several billion people, to become a celebrity is remarkable. With all his hard work, he became one of those very fortunate few. This shows that you can be very successful if you pursue your dreams.	Finally, you can achieve almost anything that you keep at because Kurt never listened to anyone who said he would fail, and never quit. Kurt’s mother Wendy told him that he should quit music. He wasn’t making money at the time, and she was unimpressed by his early material. Many others also said he should have a job to fall back on. But he didn’t listen. If he had listened, we wouldn’t have had one of the biggest rock bands of the 90’s. He didn’t give up and he achieved his dream of success and worldwide fame. 	Anyone can achieve almost anything because Kurt had a number one record, he became famous worldwide, and he didn’t listen to those who tried to bring him down. I can personally connect to his story because there have been moments where I have been determined to accomplish something. Several years ago, I was planning to go on a 14 mile hike. All of my friends said I wouldn’t last that long. But I didn’t listen to them and I kept my head high. I walked it the next day and proved everyone completely wrong. Kurt did the same thing by becoming a rock star and an icon of his generation.	Overall, I have learned that anyone can achieve anything, no matter what background or heritage they come from, no matter what their story is. People who stay determined will achieve great things in the end.(less)

For a long time, I have wanted to read about the life of Kurt Cobain.  Not only was he one of the most important pop-culture figures of my adolescence, but his enigmatic personality, cryptic lyrics and almost mythical status piqued my curiosity.  Charles Cross' biography does the man and his work justice.At 365 pages, it's a little longer than I had anticipated, but not a single chapter is worth skipping.  Cross describes Cobain's life with careful attention to detail, even cross-referencing specific interview quotes with particular personality traits and anecdotal data to bring out exaggerations, contradictions, even lies.  His grasp of Cobain is so exacting that you would swear the book was written by either his psychologist or father.  The irony is, Cobain didn't ever attend the former, and the latter wouldn't be the best source of information.Cobain's life was turbulent, that is nothing new.  The truly revealing moments though, are brought out in descriptions of Kurt with his first loves - the paradox of not caring what people thought about him, while at the same time being unhealthily self-conscious; the desire to be hip, while at the same time adhering to that punk-rock ethos of abandoning social constructs; his desire to break out and be a star, and his rejection of it once it finally came.Reading this puts his moments in the limelight into perspective.  Performances that I saw on TV, in music videos or awards shows, were the brief, bright instances of everything miraculously coming together.  Kurt was at his best while performing.  Backstage, it was a different story.  The coupling of a dysfunctional family during his adolescent years with an undiagnosed stomach condition led Kurt to seek solace in the arms of controlled substances, a history painfully well documented in this book.For anyone looking to understand the historical figure of Kurt Cobain, this book is a must buy.

I was introduced to Nirvana's music by the television show My So Called Life ( a great show cancelled after one year). So, I was curious about Kurt Cobain. I knew he committed suicide (but some people believe he was murdered.)Cross' biography seems very well documented. It's full of quotes from Kurt's friends, band members, family, ex-girlfriends, and of course (no one can shut her up) Courtney Love. Cross treats Love very sympathically in this book. It seems pretty clear from the book that Love decided that she wanted Kurt and went after him. Cross also deals with her drug addiction smypathically -- she had to deal with Kurt, she had a terrible childhood, and she is an artist. Her relastionship with Kurt was not a positive thing for either of them. Lots of drugs and lots of fighting. Kurt's drug addiction is what killed him. There is some discussion in the book about whether Kurt sufferred from depression and whether his stomach pain was psychosomatic. According to the book, he saw lots of doctors for his stomach pain but never found much relief except from nacarotics. Or maybe his stomach pain was the excuse he used to obtain and use drugs. Based on the information in this book about his childhood and growning up, he had lots of reasons to be depressed.His early girlfriend Tracy is probably one of the best people in the book. She worked for years at Boeing and supported Kurt while he stayed home and wrote songs and began to use drugs. His father also seemed like a good person although Kurt spent years not speaking to him.Probably the biggest event in Kurt's emotional life was his parents divorce when he was in grade school. Initially, he went to live with his Dad, but eventually his father remarried and this upset Kurt and the advent of his baby stepbrother stole his only son status. But at least in his father's house he had to follow rules and had some structure. His mother Wendy is a definitely not a model mother. She decided she wanted the divorce. When Kurt finally moved in with her during his early high school years, she would embarrass him by making out with her boyfriends infront of him. Never really able to support herself, she had two later marriages that ended in divorce. When Kurt was still in high school, she kicked him out. He also lived with some other people who tried to help him, but Kurt was his own worst enemy and did things for attention that caused him to be asked to leave. He ended up living on the streets as a high school student. His music reflects alot of his childhood and adolescent pain. The book contains lots of quotes from Kurt's journals which offers readers alot of insight into his character and his song writing processes. He was a gifted wordsmith. This book is a good read if you want to learn about Cobain but beware the author was indebted to Courtney because she gave him access to Kurt's journals before they were published so his portrait of Love is very sympathic. There are also some photographs in the book that span Kurt's short life. Kurt was truly the key man in Nirvana. He wrote the songs and most of the music. The other band members were talented musicians but did not contribute much to the songwriting. Nirvana became very successful very quickly, created gold records, and won music awards. Nevermind and Inutero are the two albums discussed in the book,(less)

     Being a huge Nirvana fan, I am always searching for the perfect stories that let me into the lives of the performers. Heavier Than Heaven was the perfect escape into the depths of Kurt Cobain (late frontman of Nirvana)'s life.      Heavier Than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain unravels the shocking story of Kurt Cobain, frontman of Nirvana and grunge hero. The story starts with the rebellious acts of young Cobain, and quickly accelerates to adolescent years when punk bands were booming and teenagers everywhere were listening. As a huge Nirvana fan, this book allowed me to dive deep into Kurt's personal life and leads the reader into the truth of his depression and strange behavior, up until the last of his dark, twisted days.       Cross's use of quotes from Cobain's family members, friends, and bandmates give an intimate perspective of what it was like knowing Kurt, rather than just writing a book based on boring facts. While the book is a decent length, I feel as though Cross spent an extremely long time detailing Kurt's child life, rather than his adult life being in Nirvana and struggling with drugs and depression. I would have much rather read about that than about his favorite toys as a child or what his grandparents got him for his seventh Christmas. All in all, I feel this book is a good read (no pun intended) for any Nirvana fan, or music fan in general. Four stars. (less)

Those who know me best are aware that, besides books, music is my other big passion. There is not a single day that I don't feel the need to get carried away by songs that make me remember places, situations, persons and emotions. I don't constantly try to hear new bands or artists, because I'd rather stick with the ones I already love. Nirvana is one of those bands.Most of you probably have heard of Nirvana, the most memorable band of the 90's, also because the tragedy that ended up the band, but what really stands out for me is the ethereal and timeless music.Heavier Than Heaven tells the story of the man who created Nirvana, from his childhood until the tragedy surrounding his death. This book also accounts for the story of Nirvana. Although I'm not catholic, reading this book was a little like reading Jesus Christ story: even though I know the end, it's impossible to avoid the desire that it had been otherwise.While I was reading about Kurt Cobain's life, I realised the devastating impact that a divorce during the childhood can have in a particularly sensitive and different child. Sometimes, there are profoundly defining events in our lifes and, if we don't have the mental structure that allow us to carry on, the consequences can be catastrophic. I've read the story of a man who grey in the middle of contradictions inside himself, like spending his whole life wanting to be loved and then succumb when he had the entire world at his feet. I followed the story of a genius (he was one, like it or not) that without his peculiar character and the traumatic events that he had to go trough, wouldn't have left us what he did. It's also an account (sometimes shocking) of what drug addiction can make to a person.I can't avoid feeling sad reading this tragic tale, but sometimes we have to stand face to face with others' struggles so we can learn to put things in perspective and learn. Here's what I learned: life is our most valuable gift.Since this biography was writen based in interviews (Dave Grohl and Kurt's mother notably stayed out), there is a lot of subjectivy here. Sometimes, I think the author took too much liberties in his assumptions.I don't recommend this book lightly, but I think it's a must read for any Nirvana fan and for anyone who cares about the imperfect human being.(less)
I found this book fascinating, and was even teary by the very end page!

No way! I've collaborated with one of my idols, William Burroughs and I couldn't feel cooler. I moved away to L.A. for a year and came back to find that three of my best friends have become full blow heroine addicts. I've learned to hate riot grrrl, a movement in which I was a witness to its very initial inception because I fucked the girl who put out the first grrr-style fanzine and now she is exploiting the fact that she fucked me. Not in a huge way, but enough to feel exploited. But that's ok because I chose to let corporate white men exploit me a few years ago and I love it. It feels good. And I'm not gonna donate a single fucking dollar to the fucking needy indie fascist regime. They can starve. Let them eat vinyl. Every crumb for himself. I'll be able to sell my untalented, very ungenious ass for years based on my cult status."Ripping on Calvin Johnson and indie rockers - ha! Love it.(less)
I read these two Kurt Cobain biographies as part of some research for my new novel, which I wanted to have some tangential connections to Nirvana and Cobain.

Azerrad wrote his book while Cobain was still alive, and so only the epilogue (added later) even addresses his suicide.  Cross, on the other hand, wrote his book about 10 years later, so the coming suicide of Cobain really colors almost every chapter in the book.  The first book seems completely surprised (as most of the fans were at the time) by Kurt's suicide - despite interviews where Kurt told Azerrad about his destructive drug addictions and so on.  The second book seems from the first page to try and unravel the mystery of why he would later kill himself.  Cross's book is great to read - in places he brings Kurt to life (no pun intended) almost like a fictional character in a novel - and is greatly aided by unprecedented access to Kurt's old journals and artworks, which Courtney Love has kept in storage all this time.  Internet rumors abound that Cross's book will soon be made into a biopic, starring James McAvoy... still not sure how I feel about this, but I imagine there'll be much outrage to come as that goes forward.(less)
If you want to read an accurate book on Kurt Cobain don't read this one. It's filled with lies. The author wrote this with Courtney Love and she edited it so she and Kurt, mostly her, looked better. Here is a website that confirms all of this. Just scroll down a bit to where the book is mentioned.  http://www.justiceforkurt.com/coverag...
After reading through this a second time, I have discovered multiple factual errors. If someone were to learn about Kurt by reading this, they would be extremely off on their assumptions of him because of how the book portrays him.
This book is the Courtney Love sanctioned version of Kurt Cobain. May be something to bear in mind while reading it.
Normally you would consider Kurt Cobain to be "the voice of a generation", as in, "the voice of Generation X" - when in reality, he's also A voice for various generations that came after him.

Normally you would consider Kurt Cobain to be "the voice of a generation", as in, "the voice of Generation X" - when in reality, he's also A voice for various generations that came after him. The internet really destroyed the idea of a cohesive generational identity, and Kurt Cobain was one of the last pre-Napster rock stars to ever be exploited horribly by the music industry as he lay in poverty while touring in vans and generally getting high on heroin even though he was meant to be a father to his kid.Kurt Cobain to me wasn't so much a man I idolised so much as being fascinated by. What drives a musician with his level of popularity to suicide when he had a lot he could have achieved beyond the morbid goal he set for himself at a young age to become a famous rock star and commit suicide?Let me put it this way, as tragic as Hunter S. Thompson's death by his own hand was, he at least lived long enough to retain a legacy amongst several generations, and Thompson was barely MTV friendly - so he doesn't really have the same rock star burdens Kurt Cobain had. Thompson killed himself when he was round about sixty - Kurt Cobain was far younger which makes his death even more confusing because if he survived longer he could have been even more influential on the way music was made these days than the "he's popular because he's dead" vibe he tends to get picketed with by young people my age.When I was around three or four, I heard the news of his death on the radio, but the euphemism "killed himself" registered in my brain as he had an accident rather than suicide. At least that's what I remember my parents telling me. It's probably what turned me into a graveyard visit loving baby-bat without makeup when I was a kid, I wasn't cool enough to be a goth but I certainly had the 'tude.But to really immerse myself in the reading of this epic biography I listened to his music on my iTunes played on my computer nearby, all his albums I had were loaded into the player and I listened as I read, and soon enough I became immersed not just in the biography, but the music. The idea of Kurt Cobain as a musician really has to be separated from his tragic rock star legend for you to understand what this music really meant for alternative music and grunge in general. I don't mind grunge music, in fact, considering my limited musical experience I liked it in ways I couldn't appreciate properly as a teenager who listened to Nirvana played on late night Triple M radio (a Sydney rock station that in the early 2000s would play 1990s rock music like Metallica's Black Album and Nirvana stuff). At the time I had no idea Smells Like Teen Spirit was even a Nirvana song, they just played the tracks without telling you who the band was.And I guess that was why I liked Nirvana's music better than I would have if I knew anything about that music going in - Kurt Cobain's music while heavily linked to his biographical details should be enjoyed in lieu of the tragedy his life really was. Especially since the details of his life exaggerated his actual experiences - a less polite way of saying it would be that Kurt just made shit up as he was going along to justify his experience as a tortured artist who wanted his parents to look bad.Kurt Cobain may have been the Douchebag of the Decade as far as rock stars who treated their fans like scum when times were turbulent went, but he had a personality and a general style that's just fascinating to read about. Remember - this was a man who grew up without internet, so his experiences hunting down little artifacts of culture he enjoyed in his quieter moments really signify an age when you couldn't just order a realistic light up lightsaber off the internet like you can now. To be a cool dude who was into cool things, you had to know the right people and you had to really EARN it.Cobain wasn't born cool, he gradually became cool because he lived through utterly bizarre circumstances. Don't even get me started about how angry I was at Courtney Love after reading this. If there was a Twilight-esque Team Whatever contest of people who allegedly ruined rock bands, between Team Yoko Ono and Team Courtney Love, I'm bloody sorry - but Yoko Ono wins out by default because she may have tried to secure her legacy by marrying John Lennon, but you know what? Yoko Ono never bonded with Lennon over drug abuse, nor was she anywhere near as controlling as Kurt's girlfriend who was referred to in the biography by one of Kurt's associates in the music biz as "a psycho hose beast".I can honestly see why John Lennon liked Yoko a lot better than why Courtney and Kurt should have been together, because Kurt and Courtney are pretty much just as twisted a union and Edward Cullen and Bella Swan in the Twilight series. Thinking hard about it, "you're my personal brand of heroin" just got a whole lot creepier now I'm pondering it.You can't really blame Kurt Cobain for being co-dependent on this woman though, he was very naive about his sexual politics to begin with, and I'm probably going to guess that poor Kurt was validated by Courtney's clinginess to him. Kurt's no saint either though - he did some pretty messed up things too. That's the problem with worshipping rock stars. They have feet of clay, and this biography portrays those feet very well crafted in the kiln that is the writing of a decent rock star bio.I've never read a rock star bio before, and since Kurt Cobain in my mind was the one rock star I'd heard of that I knew was guaranteed to have a biography out on him, I chose this one for my brother's bookshop clerk girlfriend to send me for Christmas. I was not disappointed in this book in the least, it's a powerful study in how an artistically talented but kind of jerk-ass small town boy gets so famous without him even noticing how it affects people, because he withdrew inside himself so much nobody could really save him from himself.(less)
Not as incorrect as the movie "Last Days" likely was, but still leaves much to be desired.  Regardless of whether or not I agree with the author's opinion that Kurt Cobain killed himself, this book was interesting to me because Kurt Cobain is.  It would have been impossible for anyone to create an accurate, chronological time-line of Kurt Cobain's life/experiences, given how spontaneous and dynamic he was, which is something this book makes apparent.  In that regard this book is accurate.  It painte...more
Not as incorrect as the movie "Last Days" likely was, but still leaves much to be desired.  Regardless of whether or not I agree with the author's opinion that Kurt Cobain killed himself, this book was interesting to me because Kurt Cobain is.  It would have been impossible for anyone to create an accurate, chronological time-line of Kurt Cobain's life/experiences, given how spontaneous and dynamic he was, which is something this book makes apparent.  In that regard this book is accurate.  It painted a picture of a man with a plan, who made decisions that seemed to be without a moment's second-thought, but decisions that nonetheless, seemed to fit in somewhere, and it makes one wonder whether or not he knew what he was doing the entire time. . .Ultimately, don't read this book because you want to know more about Kurt Cobain's experiences, or whether or not he killed himself, if you read it, read it because it does paint a picture of how those around him viewed him.  Should you decide to read it, take every event with a grain of salt, since a lot of the story is told from the different perspectives of those around Kurt Cobain.  Some of those stories may be exaggerated or even incorrect.  Never assume anything actually happened.  (less)
[please, ignore any spelling/grammar mistakes]If you ask me if it is possible to describe the same person as "insane" and as a "genius", I'd say yes without even blinking. And we are talking about Kurt Cobain, who, as the fans know, was a billion contradictions at once.If I already liked his band, Nirvana, after reading this biography I like their music even more.Family issues, drug addiction, depression and other factors surely played a part in Kurt's personality, there's no denying it.

And we are talking about Kurt Cobain, who, as the fans know, was a billion contradictions at once.If I already liked his band, Nirvana, after reading this biography I like their music even more.Family issues, drug addiction, depression and other factors surely played a part in Kurt's personality, there's no denying it. But another feature is also important: his creative artistic mind. Art was the way he expressed himself the most - be it music, poetry, drawing, painting or whatever on Earth he felt like tinkering with. "Unconventional" is the first word I can think of to talk about his works; and he wasn't afraid of what others would think about his art.What frightened me reading this book was how much I could relate with Cobain's personality, and being able to relate is something that makes me like what I'm reading.According to the synopsis, this book is the result of the author's research. It refrains from delivering oppinions on anything Kurt did, and I really liked it, because it means the book won't make the reader think "Right, he was a f**d up junkie" or "OMG, he was the most amazing person ever!" - my oppinion won't be influenced by the author's.A must-read for any Nirvana/Kurt Cobain fan, or anyone who wants to know what's on a very complex, interesting mind.(less)
Not only was this book wonderfully researched, it was also powerfully written. In my opinion it's rare for a biography to be such a riveting example of storytelling, especially when so much is publicly known about the subject, but this book proved otherwise. A very moving portrait of someone who in many ways got what he always wanted, only to discover he was so ill fitted for the fame he sought.

Not only was this book wonderfully researched, it was also powerfully written. In my opinion it's rare for a biography to be such a riveting example of storytelling, especially when so much is publicly known about the subject, but this book proved otherwise. A very moving portrait of someone who in many ways got what he always wanted, only to discover he was so ill fitted for the fame he sought. The author exhausted nearly every possible reference for this book, talking to everyone close to Kurt, as well as scouring through countless interviews and the journals to present a complete picture of an iconic figure. What comes through so strikingly is the story of a child who felt lost after the divorce of his parents and was never really able to reconcile those feelings, which show up in so many of his songs. It shows a person so driven to be accepted and adored, while possessing none of the traits one needs to cope with that adoration once it's given. Before reading the book, someone had warned me that the ending was really sad. I told them I knew how it ended, so I thought it would be okay. But the truth was, the ending was indeed very sad and moving. It really showed the struggle one faces when they decide they simply can't go on anymore and knowing they are going to devastate those closest to them. (less)
Less bombshells and more sad realizations in this book. I've been devouring a lot of information about Kurt lately, and no matter how badly I wish that he was still around, making music...the less it seems that could have ever happened, no matter what. If it weren't for this event he would not have been a star, if it weren't for that event he wouldn't have been a heroin addict, if it weren't for ALL these events, he would not have been so profoundly, emotionally ill-equipped for the level of fam...more
Less bombshells and more sad realizations in this book. I've been devouring a lot of information about Kurt lately, and no matter how badly I wish that he was still around, making music...the less it seems that could have ever happened, no matter what. If it weren't for this event he would not have been a star, if it weren't for that event he wouldn't have been a heroin addict, if it weren't for ALL these events, he would not have been so profoundly, emotionally ill-equipped for the level of fame that hit him...at the same time he became a father. But it took all those things to make him the person who made the music he did. A happier childhood would have led to a different musical path - so he might still be alive, but would he still have turned out a song like 'Something in the Way'? I personally don't think so. While I disagree with his choice (as a person who has loved a friend who felt that a bullet to the head was the only way out - I cannot and will not embrace it, obviously), I think about what would have happened if he had not died the way he did. This is not to be inflammatory - although I know how it sounds - but he said what he felt, he said what he meant, he knew what he wanted, and he followed through on it. Because of that, he is not some disingenuous douchey rock star, who says he doesn't want fame but no one believes him. I cannot even imagine a middle-aged Kurt Cobain, and it's not for lack of trying. I read this book and wanted to find some place, some crossroads where he could still have been the same, but happier. Different. It doesn't exist. We are not, as he assumed, better off with him gone, but you can't help feel that HE is. I know this is less review and more life-commentary, but the truth is that if you are going to read this book, you know how it ends and you might be wanting to get a better sense of WHY and/or looking for answers for yourself, like I was. I was not entirely pleased with them, but ultimately satisfied. I don't expect you to understand that. This is a very thorough, seemingly unbiased picture of Kurt - from birth all the way to the end.If you loved him & his music and feel a sense of loss whenever you listen to it, this deserves your attention. He should be remembered as a whole, not just for his last, selfish act on this planet.   (less)
I came across this saying a very long time ago, ‘Biographies lends to death a new terror’ and that's how this book is to me. The writer does an awesome job in plot exploration and the fictional intimacy is so wildly gripping that it sucks out every conscious doubt out of the soul. Really if I wanted to read about pubic hair, I would have picked up a porn star's memoirs than spend a whole week trying to finish this book.

I came across this saying a very long time ago, ‘Biographies lends to death a new terror’ and that's how this book is to me. The writer does an awesome job in plot exploration and the fictional intimacy is so wildly gripping that it sucks out every conscious doubt out of the soul. Really if I wanted to read about pubic hair, I would have picked up a porn star's memoirs than spend a whole week trying to finish this book. Sadly though, nothing much came in sight about Nirvana at the time this book was printed and since it was written by a critically acclaimed journalist, it just made the book all the more interesting proposition. This book failed to deliver authentic retrospection of the actual events in many parts especially: Chapter 23, Page 326, Charles writes: On the way to the airport, Kurt realised he had left the box of shotgun cartridges in his bag and asked Ottinger if he’d dispose them. The driver said yes, and…- Ottinger was interviewed live in a documentary ’48 hours’ to shed some light on the final days of Kurt Cobain’s life and the limo driver stated that Kurt insisted him to return the cartridges to his home. Ottinger states and I quote: he was pretty insistent that I send the box back to his house. Chapter 23, page 323, : "Black tar heroin frequently caused abscesses from the impurities used to cut it. By March, Kurt's arms had scabs and abscesses, which themselves were a potential health danger." He claimed to have done 400 interviews but failed to crosscheck the above. Kurt Cobain took the stage of Munich, Germany on the 1st March 1994, there was not a single scab or abscess mark on his arm, and he was wearing a short-sleeved shirt. Kurt Cobain likes long sleeve shirts and he wears layers of clothes to hide his skinny frame but that day, he wore short-sleeve. Where's the validity in this? (See RHCP photos when guitarist John was still with the group. That’s how a heroin’s arms looks like. Thank God, John managed to kick H’s ass and recovered) I truly think that as a biographer who is obligated in telling the truth about a dead man's legacy who was alone at his most vulnerable state at the time of this heartbreaking tragedy, the scene of his suicide should have not been inserted into this book for no one knows how it happened for no one was there with him. The book relentlessly tells us that Kurt Cobain is an avid H user that he could take more than anyone else so how exactly would the author know that he shot H after writing the suicide note and not before? It all seems to be all to fictional. Kurt Cobain had an outsized mind and a subterranean sensitivity to his overall persona, which sometimes appeared that anguish, and affliction was somehow predestined in his life. It was that melancholy that made his art so beautifully heartbreaking and ignited an army of fans who could connect to the darkness that lives leaves within an individual. Who decides if heaven is to heavy for Kurt Cobain? We do not have such powers. It is within God's will to send Cobain where he thinks is befitting for this man and not us. What saddens me the most is, we lost him to soon in life, before he had the opportunity to encounter true love, not to say he did not love his wife at the time he was alive, I honestly think he did love her with all his heart but the more traditional kind of love that he had been searching for all his life. But as Morrison once said 'love can't save you from yourself' so to say, it couldn't save him. It's a tragedy that bestows artistic genius because a huge proportion of their lives are cursed with curiosity and constant need to search for truth.(less)

He is the founder of Backstreets magazine, a periodical for fans of Bruce Springsteen, editor of "Springsteen: the Man and His Music," a compilation of Backstreets articles, and is also author of a biography of Kurt Cobain, titled Heavier Than Heaven. His most recent release is entitled Room Full Of Mirrors - A Biography Of Jimi Hendrix.In 2004, while conducting research for the Hendrix book, Cross rediscovered the gravesite of Jimi Hendrix's mother, Lucille Jeter Hendrix, in an abandoned section of Greenwood Memorial Park, where Jimi Hendrix himself is buried in an elaborate granite memorial. The gravesite of Lucille Hendrix was lost because the standard welfare marker of her day, an inscribed brick, became buried in decades of mud from the area's notorious heavy rains. Cross delivered a moving eulogy for Lucille when a proper headstone was dedicated at the site.Courtney Love, the widow of Kurt Cobain, has acquired the rights to Heavier Than Heaven, which is now being made into a film by Universal Pictures. This is the first film to be made from Cross' work.(less)
