Florence Leontine Mary Welch[1] (born 28 August 1986)[2][3][4] is an English musician, singer, and songwriter. She is best known as the lead vocalist of the indie rock band Florence + the Machine. The band's debut album, Lungs, was released in 2009; on 17 January 2010, the album reached the top position, after being on the chart for 28 consecutive weeks. The group's second studio album, Ceremonials, released in October 2011, debuted at number one in the UK and number six in the United States.
Florence Leontine Mary Welch was born in in Camberwell, London on 28 August 1986. Her British father is Nick Welch, an advertising executive,[5] and her mother is an American expatriate from New York[5] and the Harvard University- and Warburg Institute, University of London-educated[6] Professor of Renaissance Studies and Vice-Principal for Arts and Sciences at King's College London, Evelyn Welch.[7] Nick and Evelyn later divorced in 1990,[8] and both remarried;[9] when she was 13 years old, Welch, her mother, and her two younger siblings moved in with their next-door neighbour and his three teenage children. According to Welch, "We get on brilliantly now, but it was a nightmare then. I just used to stay in my room and dance around".[10]
Nick contributed a "rock and roll element to the family mix"; in his twenties, he lived in a West End squat and attended the Squatters' Ball organised by Heathcote Williams where The 101ers played regularly.[11] A self-confessed "frustrated performer", if Nick, as he put it, "nudged Flo in any way, it's only been to listen to the Ramones rather than Green Day".[11] Evelyn had an equally strong yet completely different influence on her daughter. A visit to one of her mother's lectures left teenage Florence deeply impressed. She explained, "I aspire to something like that but with music. I hope that my music has some of the big themes—sex, death, love, violence—that will still be part of the human story in 200 years' time".[11]
Welch is the niece of the satirist Craig Brown[5] via Brown's wife and Welch's aunt, Frances Welch,[12] and granddaughter of former deputy editor of The Daily Telegraph and former Daily Mail parliamentary sketchwriter James Colin Ross Welch, originally of Cambridgeshire.[12][13]
Welch's fascination with terror and doom was intensified by the death of her grandparents within a few years of each other.[1] At 10 years old, Welch witnessed her paternal grandfather Colin's deterioration following a stroke and death on 28 January 1997;[9] at 14 years old, Welch's maternal grandmother, an art historian who had suffered from manic depression,[8] committed suicide.[1]
During her youth, Welch was encouraged by her Scottish paternal grandmother, Sybil Welch (née Russell),[12] to pursue her performing and singing talents;[14] Welch sang "Over the Sea to Skye" at her paternal grandmother's funeral, following her death from a stroke.[14] Welch sang at her maternal grandmother's funeral as well.[15] Welch's dead grandmothers inspired numerous songs on Florence and the Machine's début album, Lungs.[16] Although she has an American passport via her mother, growing up, she did not spend much time in the United States.[15]
Florence was educated at Thomas's London Day School then went onto Alleyn's School, South East London, where she did well academically,[1] despite her diagnoses of dyslexia and dyspraxia.[17] Welch often got in trouble in school for impromptu singing.[1]
Upon leaving secondary school and "just bumming around Camberwell where I lived, working at a bar and thought that I should start doing something with life", Florence studied at Camberwell College of Arts before dropping out to focus on her music.[1] Initially, she had intended to take a year out from her studies to "see where the music would go and then it started going somewhere so I never went back".[15]
According to Welch, the "Florence + the Machine" as a band name "started off as a private joke that got out of hand. I made music with my friend, who we called Isabella Machine, to which I was Florence Robot. When I was about an hour away from my first gig, I still didn't have a name, so I thought 'Okay, I'll be Florence Robot/Isa Machine', before realising that name was so long it'd drive me mad".[1][18] In 2006, Welch's performances with Summers in small London venues under the joint name Florence Robot/Isa Machine began to attract notice.[citation needed]
In 2007, Welch recorded with a band named Ashok, who released an album titled Plans on the Filthy Lucre/About Records label. This album included the earliest version of her later hit "Kiss with a Fist", which at this point was titled "Happy Slap".[19] She signed a contract for Ashok with a manager; but, feeling that she was "in the wrong band", she resigned, which cancelled the contract.[1]
Florence and the Machine is managed by Mairead Nash (one half of the DJ duo Queens of Noize), who decided to manage the singer when an inebriated Welch followed Nash into the toilets at a club[1][17] and sang Etta James' 1962 song "Something's Got a Hold on Me".[5]
Florence and the Machine released their debut album Lungs in the United Kingdom on 6 July 2009. The album was officially launched with a set at the Rivoli Ballroom in Brockley, South East London. It peaked at number one in the UK and number two in Ireland. As of 6 August 2009, the album had sold over 100,000 copies in the UK and by 10 August it had been at number two for five consecutive weeks.[20][21] Following its 25 July 2009 release for download in the United States, the album debuted at number seventeen on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart,[22] ultimately peaking at number one.[23] The album was released physically in the US on 20 October by Universal Republic.[24] The album was produced by James Ford, Paul Epworth, Steve Mackey and Charlie Hugall.[25]
Welch contributed vocals to David Byrne and Fatboy Slim's 2010 album Here Lies Love, an album about Imelda Marcos.[26] As of January 2011, Welch was working with Drake on material slated for his upcoming album.[27]
Following her rise to fame, Welch suffered a bout of depression, in part due to the demands of touring and loneliness.[28][29][30]
The band's second album, Ceremonials, was released on 31 October 2011. It debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and number six on the US Billboard 200.[31][32] On 12 January 2012, Florence and the Machine were nominated for two Brit Awards, with the awards ceremony taking place on 21 February 2012 at the O2 Arena, London.[33] On 26 April 2012, the band released "Breath of Life", a song which was recorded as the official theme song for the film Snow White and the Huntsman.[34][35] On 5 July 2012, a remix of "Spectrum" by Scottish musician Calvin Harris was released as the fourth single from Ceremonials, becoming the band's first UK number-one hit.[36] Welch has expressed excitement about putting new material together for a third album after the band finishes touring at the end of September 2012.[37]
On October 2012, she was featured on Scottish singer-songwriter and producer Calvin Harris's song "Sweet Nothing", which debuted and peaked at number one on the UK singles chart, marking Welch's second number one.[38] The song was taken from Harris's third studio album 18 Months and is the fifth single from the album. "Sweet Nothing" also peaked at number one in Ireland and number two in Australia and New Zealand. "Sweet Nothing" was certified Platinum in Australia.
Florence has been compared to other female singers such as Kate Bush,[39][40] Siouxsie Sioux,[39][40] PJ Harvey,[39] and Björk.[40] During an interview, Welch cited Grace Slick as her influence and "hero".[41] Florence and the Machine's style has been described as "dark, robust and romantic".[39] Their music is a mix of "classic soul and midnight-on-the-moors English art rock".[39] Welch stated that her lyrics related to Renaissance artists : "We're dealing with all of the same things they did : love and death, time and pain, heaven and hell".[42] Welch has used religious imagery in her music and performances, though she has stated "I'm not a religious person. Sex, violence, love, death, are the topics that I'm constantly wrestling with, it's all connected back to religion."[43]
When discussing her fashion style, Welch said that, "For the stage, it's The Lady of Shalott meets Ophelia...mixed with scary gothic bat lady. But in real life I'm kind of prim".[44] Welch has become noticed for her red curls (though she is actually a natural brunette)[45][46] and a style that has been described as daring but nonchalant. As a teenager she read fashion magazines more often than music magazines. Early in her music career she dressed in a tomboy style. 2011 saw Gucci dressing her for her summer tour and a performance at the Chanel runway show at Paris Fashion Week.[47] Welch describes 1970s American drag queen troupe The Cockettes and French chanson singer Françoise Hardy as fashion mentors.[48] Welch has also named Fleetwood Mac pop/rock singer Stevie Nicks as a musical, fashion, and general influence. A Huffington Post entertainment article quotes her as telling a reporter that "I'm pretty obsessed with Stevie Nicks from her style to her voice. I like watching her on YouTube and her old performances, the way she moves and everything". Welch can sometimes be seen in concert paying homage to Nicks' famous billowing stage dress. She later sings in the song "Sweet Nothing" by Calvin Harris showing her as a man in the beginning of the music video on YouTube, and later showing her as a woman (revealing clothing).[49]
Welch had a long-term relationship with a literary editor, Stuart Hammond, from 2008 to 2011. Their temporary split provided inspiration for much of the Lungs album.[50] Welch says, "He prefers me not to talk about it. It's funny then singing about it."[20] The couple broke up by mutual decision because of conflicting career demands, and the break-up provided material for Florence + the Machine's second album, Ceremonials.[51]
Welch lives with her mother, younger sister, younger brother, stepfather, two half-brothers, and half-sister.[5][9]

Florence and the Machine (styled as Florence + the Machine)[4] are an English indie rock band, consisting of lead singer Florence Welch, Isabella "Machine" Summers, and a collaboration of other artists. The band's music had received praise across the media, especially from the BBC, before they gained mainstream success. Specifically, the BBC played a large part in their rise to prominence by promoting Florence and the Machine as part of BBC Introducing.
The band's debut studio album, Lungs, was released on 6 July 2009, and held the number-two position for its first five weeks on the UK Albums Chart.[5] On 17 January 2010, the album reached the top position, after being on the chart for twenty-eight consecutive weeks.[6] As of October 2010, the album had been in the top forty in the United Kingdom for sixty-five consecutive weeks, making it one of the best-selling albums of 2009 and 2010. The group's second studio album, Ceremonials, released in October 2011, entered the charts at number one in the UK and number six in the US.
Florence and the Machine's sound has been described as a combination of various genres, including rock and soul.[7][8] Lungs won the MasterCard British Album award at the 2010 BRIT Awards. At the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards, Florence and the Machine were nominated for Best New Artist. Additionally, the band performed at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards and the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize Concert.
The name of Florence and the Machine is attributed to Florence Welch's teenage collaboration with Isabella "Machine" Summers. Welch and Summers performed together for a time under the name Florence Robot/Isa Machine. According to Welch, "The name Florence and the Machine started off as a private joke that got out of hand. I made music with my friend, who we called Isabella Machine to which I was Florence Robot. When I was about an hour away from my first gig, I still didn't have a name, so I thought 'Okay, I'll be Florence Robot/Isa Machine', before realising that name was so long it'd drive me mad."[9][10]
In addition to Summers (keyboards and backing vocals), the current band members include musicians Robert Ackroyd (guitar and backing vocals), Chris Hayden (drums, percussion and backing vocals), Mark Saunders (bass guitar and backing vocals) and Tom Monger (harp).[11] In the past, Welch has praised the Machine for understanding her creative process, claiming, "I've worked with most of them for a long time and they know my style, know the way I write, they know what I want."[12]
In 2007, Welch recorded with a band named Ashok, who released an album titled Plans on the Filthy Lucre/About Records label. This album included the earliest version of her later hit "Kiss with a Fist", which at this point was titled "Happy Slap".[13] She signed a contract for Ashok with a manager, but feeling that she was "in the wrong band" she resigned, which cancelled the contract.[9] Florence and the Machine are managed by Mairead Nash (one half of the DJ duo Queens of Noize), who decided to manage the singer when an inebriated Welch followed Nash into the toilets at a club[9][14] and sang Etta James' 1962 song "Something's Got a Hold on Me".[15]
Florence and the Machine released their first album Lungs in the United Kingdom on 6 July 2009. The album was produced by James Ford, Paul Epworth, Steve Mackey and Charlie Hugall.[8] Much of the material on the album was written as reaction to what turned out to be a temporary break-up with Welch's former boyfriend. Welch said, "He prefers me not to talk about it. It's funny then singing about it."[16] The album was officially launched with a set at the Rivoli Ballroom in Brockley, South East London. It peaked at number one in the UK and number two in Ireland. As of 6 August 2009, the album had sold over 100,000 copies in the UK and by 10 August it had been at number two for five consecutive weeks.[16][17] Following its 25 July 2009 release for download in the United States, the album entered the charts at number seventeen on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart,[18] ultimately peaking at number one.[19] The album was released physically in the US on 20 October by Universal Republic.[20]
"Kiss with a Fist" was released as the album's lead single on 9 June 2008. The track was featured on the soundtrack to the films Wild Child,[21] Jennifer's Body,[22] and St Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold,[23] as well as in the television series 90210,[24] Community[25] and Saving Grace.[26] Follow-up single "Dog Days Are Over", released on 1 December 2008, was recorded with no instruments in a studio the "size of a loo".[27] The song was used in the American television series Gossip Girl,[28] Covert Affairs,[29] in the British television series Skins,[30] and in the theatrical trailer for the 2010 comedy-drama film Eat Pray Love, starring Julia Roberts.[31] "Dog Days Are Over" was also featured in the Glee episode "Special Education", where it was covered by Jenna Ushkowitz and Amber Riley.[32] "Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)" was released on 22 June 2009 as the third single from the album. A small part of the song's melody, as well as the lyric "How quickly the glamour fades", were lifted from New York band Gang Gang Dance's 2008 song "House Jam" without credit on the Lungs liner notes. Members of the group noticed this and brought it to the attention of Florence and the Machine's label. Island Records acknowledged infringement and agreed to pay Gang Gang Dance a share of the song's publishing royalties. Welch agreed that she erred and said her intent was to pay homage.[33][34]
After the release of Lungs, "Drumming Song" and a cover of The Source and Candi Staton's 1986 song "You've Got the Love" were released as singles,[35][36] the latter of which also went on to become part of a mashup titled "You Got the Dirtee Love" between Welch and English rapper Dizzee Rascal. The two performed the mashup together at the 2010 BRIT Awards on 16 February 2010 and the recorded performance was subsequently released as a single the following day.[37][38]
On 5 January 2010, "Hurricane Drunk" was originally announced as the next single from the album.[39] However, on 3 March a re-release of "Dog Days Are Over" was announced on the band's website; it was released digitally on 11 April 2010 and on 7" vinyl the following day, coinciding with the release of a brand-new video.[40] "Cosmic Love" was released on 5 July 2010 as the sixth and final single from Lungs, with a music video having already been shot.[41] The song was featured in several American television shows, including Grey's Anatomy,[42] The Vampire Diaries,[43] V,[44] Nikita[45] and So You Think You Can Dance.[46] The band also made a guest appearance in the 7 February 2011 episode of Gossip Girl, titled "Panic Roommate", where they performed an acoustic rendition of "Cosmic Love".[47] On 12 May 2010, it was announced that Florence and the Machine would provide a track called "Heavy in Your Arms" for the soundtrack to The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, the third film of The Twilight Saga.[48] Eclipse was released in cinemas on 30 June 2010, with "Heavy in Your Arms" playing during the end credits. The music video followed on 7 July 2010. An exclusive remix of "I'm Not Calling You a Liar" is featured in the 2011 video game Dragon Age II as "I'm Not Calling You a Liar (Dragon Age II: Varric's Theme)", produced by the game's composer Inon Zur.[49]
Initially, Welch considered offers from the band's record label to record their second album in the United States to work with writers and producers in Los Angeles,[50] but ultimately decided to record the album in the UK. The first demo session occurred in January 2010 with Welch and Paul Epworth at a small London studio. Numerous producers expressed an interest in working on the album but Welch rejected the offers because she wanted Ceremonials to be a better version of Lungs with a "more dark, more heavy, bigger drum sounds, bigger bass, but with more of a whole sound". For the rest of the year work on the album continued only intermittently as the band concentrated on an extensive tour of the United States, where Lungs had become popular. The majority of the writing for the album was done between January and April 2011, with recording taking place in April at Abbey Road Studios. Refinement took place at Epworth's own London studios while Welch recorded vocal tracks in various US studios, during days off from touring. The final recording session took place in July at Epworth's studio.[50] Epworth co-wrote seven tracks. Several other British writers share credits on the album, including Summers, Kid Harpoon, James Ford and composer Eg White.[50]
In June 2011, a cover of the Buddy Holly classic "Not Fade Away," which Florence and the Machine recorded for the tribute album Rave on Buddy Holly tied to Holly's seventy-fifth birthday year, was released[51] and they performed Ceremonials' setup track "What the Water Gave Me" at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley, California.[52] In August 2011, the single "What the Water Gave Me" was released on iTunes[53] along with an accompanying video on the band's website and YouTube channel.[54] The video drew 1.5 million YouTube views in two days and the track received play on US alternative radio with strong support from Los Angeles radio station KROQ.[50] The single "Shake It Out" was released over the internet in September 2011, with standard release 11 October. In Australia, the song was playlisted at Triple J and Nova radio networks and received strong airplay in Scandinavia, Italy and Canada.[50]
The band's second album, Ceremonials, was released on 31 October 2011. It reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and number six on the US Billboard 200.[55][56] On 12 January 2012, Florence and the Machine were nominated for two Brit Awards, with the awards ceremony taking place on 21 February 2012 at the O2 Arena, London.[57] On 26 April 2012, the band released "Breath of Life", a song which was recorded as the official theme song for the film Snow White and the Huntsman.[58][59] On 5 July 2012, a remix of "Spectrum (Say My Name)" by Scottish musician Calvin Harris was released as the fourth single from Ceremonials, becoming the band's first UK number-one hit.[60] Welch has expressed excitement about putting new material together for a third album after the band finishes touring at the end of September 2012.[61] Welch collaborated for a second time with Harris on the song "Sweet Nothing", released on 12 October 2012 as a single from Harris's album 18 Months. The song entered at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming their second collaborative number-one single.[62]
In mid-2012, it was announced that Universal Republic Records that they were going defunct, moving all artists including Florence and the Machine to Republic Records making the label itself revived. In late August 2012, Welch told Style magazine that she plans to take a twelve-month hiatus before starting work on the band's next studio album, stating, "There's a big 'take a year off' plan. The record company have put no pressure on me for the next album. They've said I can have as long as I want."[63]
In December 2012, Florence and the Machine were nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album for Ceremonials and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for "Shake It Out" at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards.[64] On 4 April 2013, it was announced that Florence and the Machine had written a song for Baz Luhrmann's film rendition of The Great Gatsby, titled "Over the Love",[65] which was released on 17 April 2013 on SoundCloud.
Florence and the Machine started off by playing a handful of gigs in and around London, and in August 2007, the band performed at the first year of the 1–2–3–4 Shoreditch Festival, performing alongside Lightspeed Champion on the MySpace Main Stage which was hosted by manager Nash's DJ double act, Queens of Noize.[14][66] In May 2008, they supported MGMT on tour in Europe.[67] The BBC played a large part in Florence and the Machine's rise to prominence by promoting her as part of BBC Introducing.[68] This led to them playing music festivals in 2008, including Glastonbury,[69] Reading and Leeds[70] and Bestival.[71] Florence and the Machine were also part of the Shockwaves NME Awards Tour 2009 in January and February.[72]
The group played the Concerts for Teenage Cancer Trust charity event at the Royal Albert Hall in March 2009.[73] Florence and The Machine supported Blur for their 26 June comeback performance at the M.E.N. Arena in Manchester.[74] They played at the Lovebox Festival on 18 and 19 July.[75] In July 2009, the group was supporting Duran Duran.[10] They performed at the Glastonbury Festival 2009,[76] the Reading and Leeds 2009,[77] Electric Picnic 2009[78] and T in the Park 2009.[79]
Florence and the Machine played at Australia's Splendour in the Grass music festival in July 2010. The group drew one of the biggest crowds of the three-day festival. They performed in the natural open-air amphitheatre, which had to be closed off by security due to safety concerns as an unprecedented number of festival-goers rushed to see the performance. It is estimated that 28,000 people of the 33,000 people who attended the festival crammed in to see Florence and the Machine. The amphitheatre was reopened shortly after the start, once the safety concerns were allayed.[80] In October 2009, the band's equipment and instruments were caught in a trailer fire during their European tour, forcing the band to use rented instruments to complete their remaining shows.[81] Welch stated, "You could hear the harp's strings ping in the fire. Strange sound. We recorded it and I want to use it in a song."[82]
On 27 October 2009, Florence and the Machine played their first official New York City gig at the Bowery Ballroom,[83] and performed "Kiss with a Fist" on the Late Show with David Letterman.[84][85] On 5 November, the band performed "Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)" on Jimmy Kimmel Live![86] Welch stated although she would like to tour the United States, she is fearful of becoming homesick due to the time it would take to tour the country.[87]
After the success of Lungs topping the UK Albums Chart in January 2010, seven months after the album was released, Florence and the Machine announced an eleven-date UK and Ireland tour called The Cosmic Love Tour in May 2010.[88] Support acts include Babe Shadow and The Drums.[88][89] Florence and the Machine performed at Oxegen 2010,[90] T in the Park 2010,[91] the Isle of Wight Festival 2010,[92] Roskilde Festival 2010,[93] V Festival 2010,[94][95] and the San Miguel Primavera Sound 2010.[96] In March 2010, it was that confirmed that the band's first headlining festival would be Latitude 2010, having been booked the previous September before achieving mainstream success.[97]
The Cosmic Love Tour kicked off at Dublin's Olympia Theatre on 2 May 2010 where the group performed a new song called "Strangeness and Charm"[98] and ended at London's Hammersmith Apollo on 15 May 2010.[99] On 25 June, the group played the Glastonbury Festival 2010, where they performed "Strangeness and Charm" and a cover of Fleetwood Mac's "The Chain" during their ten-song set.[100] Their performance drew one of the biggest crowds of the day and one of the biggest in the Other Stage's history.[100]
Welch and Dizzee Rascal's performance of a mashup version of the band's single "You've Got the Love" and Dizzee's single "Dirtee Cash", titled "You Got the Dirtee Love", at the 2010 BRIT Awards on 16 February 2010 was described as "a definite highlight of the evening".[101] This collaboration was released as a charity single the following day, peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart.[101] She reprised the performance when she joined Dizzee on stage during his performance at the Glastonbury Festival 2010.[102] Florence and the Machine opened for U2 on the North American leg of their U2 360° Tour in June and July 2011.[103]
In an interview with New York Post's PopWrap, Welch revealed that in the weeks and months prior to her 12 September performance at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, she was so nervous she lost sleep and cried.[104] In addition, she struggled during the pre-show rehearsal with a move that required her to stand up on a rotating platform.[105] The performance was directed by So You Think You Can Dance choreographer Travis Wall and had Welch performing with a host of hyperactive dancers.[105] It was described as "both ethereal and downright joyous".[105] After the performance, Lungs rose to number two on the iTunes albums chart and "Dog Days Are Over" rose to number nine on the iTunes singles chart.[106] In addition, Florence and the Machine became the number-one search on Google and received 1,700 tweets per minute on Twitter.[106] Florence and the Machine performed "Dog Days Are Over" on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on 15 October 2010.[107] On 20 November 2010, the band performed "Dog Days Are Over" and "You've Got the Love" on Saturday Night Live.[108] They performed an online-only concert at New York City's Ed Sullivan Theater on 16 December 2010 as part of the Live on Letterman concert series.[109] Welch and a number of other female singers opened the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards on 13 February 2011 with a tribute to an ailing Aretha Franklin.[110] On 27 February 2011, Welch replaced pregnant Dido and sang her portion of Best Original Song nominee "If I Rise" (from 127 Hours) with A. R. Rahman at the 83rd Academy Awards.[111][112] Two years of worldwide touring are scheduled to promote Ceremonials.[113]
Welch led a tribute to Amy Winehouse by performing Winehouse's song "Back to Black" and the Annie Lennox-classic Walking on Broken Glass during the VH1 Divas Celebrates Soul concert held in December 2011.[114] [115] The group performed in Times Square on 31 December 2011 for the 40th annual Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve special.[116]
In July 2012 the group was forced to cancel two European dates after Welch sustained a vocal injury.[117] She was able to recover and perform at the Osheaga Festival in Montreal on 3 August 2012.[118] On 9 September, Welch performed three songs at the wedding of close friend Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds at Boone Hall Plantation in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.[119]
Florence Welch has been compared to other female singers such as Kate Bush,[120][121] Siouxsie Sioux,[120][121] PJ Harvey,[120] and Björk.[121] During an interview, Welch cited Grace Slick as her influence and "hero".[122] Florence and the Machine's style has been described as "dark, robust and romantic".[120] Their music is a mix of "classic soul and midnight-on-the-moors English art rock".[120] Welch stated that her lyrics related to Renaissance artists: "We're dealing with all of the same things they did—love and death, time and pain, heaven and hell."[123] From 2008, Welch had a relationship with Stuart Hammond, a literary editor; their temporary split provided inspiration for much of the Lungs album.[124] In 2011 the couple announced that they had broken up by mutual decision because of conflicting career demands; the break-up provided material for Florence and the Machine's second album.[113]
Florence and the Machine won the Critic's Choice Award at the 2009 BRIT Awards after coming third in the BBC's Sound of 2009 poll.[125][126] As well as attention from the BBC, the band received significant support from NME magazine, who included them on their annual Shockwaves NME Awards Tour for 2009, along with Glasvegas, Friendly Fires and White Lies.[72]
The Sunday Times described Welch as "the most peculiar and most highly acclaimed female singer of the moment" and "the latest in a line of great English pop eccentrics".[9] AllMusic referred to Lungs as "one of the most musically mature and emotionally mesmerising albums of 2009".[127] Spin magazine rated Lungs eight out of ten and wrote, "You've gotta hand it to the girl: She always makes you feel something."[128] The magazine named it the eighth best album of 2009.[129] In December 2010, Florence and the Machine appeared on one of Spin's three holiday issue covers as Artist of the Year.[130][131]
Florence and the Machine won the MasterCard British Album award for Lungs at the 2010 BRIT Awards,[132] having also been nominated for British Female Solo Artist and British Breakthrough Act.[133] On 19 February 2010, Florence and the Machine won Best International Band at the 2010 Meteor Awards.[134] The group led the nominations for the 2010 MOJO Awards, with four nods.[135] They received a nomination for Best New Artist at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards.[136] In April 2011, Florence and the Machine were ranked 50 in the 2011 Time 100 poll, which annually lists the 100 most influential people in the world.[137] American recording artist Beyoncé cited Florence and the Machine as an influence for her 2011 album 4.[138]
The Brit Awards are the British Phonographic Industry's (BPI) annual pop music awards.[139] Florence and the Machine has received two awards from eight nominations.

She's the fame-haired frontwoman for band Florence and the Machine and does a good impression of Kate Bush-meets-Stevie Nicks, but there's more to Flo (as she's known) than just the 'Kook Factor'.
She had a conventional enough background, growing up in south-east London to educated, middle-class parents, that is until her mother fell in love in with the neighbour and moved her family next door. It's fair to say this must have had a knock-on effect for Flo, who then rebelled briefly getting into punk and even starting her own band called the Toxic Cockroaches.
She had a brief foray at the Camberwell College of Art (one project being a cake iced with the words 'it's all going to get worse', which she then ate as part of the performance) before making a stab at the singing lark, which she was luckily much better at.
After drunkenly blowing her own trumpet to Queenz of Noize music promoter Mairead Nash at a bar, she was invited then to perform at London's Soho Revue Bar and the rest as they say is history.
She's since enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame, winning critical fans across the music media before she even hit the mainstream, from Radio 1's Edith Bowman to presenter Lauren Laverne and the editor of Vogue, Alexandra Shulman.
Her debut album Lungs (and a belting pair she has too) skipped to number one in the UK charts in 2009 and scooped Mastercard British Album at the 2010 BRIT Awards. Here she performed with Dizzee Rascal (who had also won the Best British Male award) for a new version of the Candi Staton classic entitled 'You Got The Dirtee Love'. The single subsequently topped the UK charts.
It's safe to say Flo (still only 22) has come a long way since her cake-eating art days, with a new Canada and US tour underway, and a second album on the boil, the dog days are clearly over for Florence and her Machine.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Florence Welch was born on August 28, 1986 in London, England as Florence Mary Leontine Welch.
      I started off singing in church as a child. The sound of voices coming together, that was my first moment of touching something outside of myself.
      I did everything backward, but everyone's been so supportive. I'm not really sure what's next. There is no plan.
      I've got my ideal job. I like to sing, I like to dance, I like to bang drums and dress up, and someone pays me - it's incredible.
      Ceremonials is a big-sounding album? I guess there's no getting around that. I'm attracted to that sense of being overwhelmed by something. If there's a chance that I might respond that way while these songs are playing around me, then someone else might too. And that's surely the point, isn't it?
      I ended up deciding to drink less while I was touring. It was for my voice. It's really hard to sing and keep up the pace that we were going at. It's OK for the first bits when you don't know where you're going. But now that I have more of an idea of the longevity of it, I'd like to have a career like P.J. Harvey or Björk, who are still producing albums and have these voices. I realized if I wanted to have a career like theirs, I'd have to temper my indulgences.
      I try to write lyrics so that they won't age, which sort of leaves you with the big subjects like death and love and sex and violence.
      I think I got introduced to Tom Waits and Kate Bush at around the same time, when I was 18 or 19. My friend at school introduced me to Hounds of Love. I liked the drums, and the freedom of expression. You get an amazing sense of things being free, but it's all very tightly-wound - quite an uptight sort of sexuality. I love that juxtaposition. But yeah, I'm obsessed with a good drum sound. And the male choir [on Hello Earth] was a stroke of genius. What I would give for a male voice choir...
