Hans Christian Andersen (Danish: [ˈhanˀs ˈkʁæsdjan ˈɑnɐsn̩]; often referred to in Scandinavia as H. C. Andersen; April 2, 1805 – August 4, 1875) was a Danish author. Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, Andersen is best remembered for his fairy tales. Andersen's popularity is not limited to children; his stories, called eventyr in Danish, or "fairy-tales" in English, express themes that transcend age and nationality.
Andersen's fairy tales, which have been translated into more than 125 languages,[1] have become culturally embedded in the West's collective consciousness, readily accessible to children, but presenting lessons of virtue and resilience in the face of adversity for mature readers as well.[2] Some of his most famous fairy tales include "The Little Mermaid", "The Snow Queen", "The Ugly Duckling", "The Nightingale", "The Emperor's New Clothes" and many more. His stories have inspired plays, ballets, and both live-action and animated films.[3]
Hans Christian Andersen was born in the town of Odense, Denmark, on Tuesday, April 2, 1805. He was an only child. Andersen's father, also Hans, considered himself related to nobility. His paternal grandmother had told his father that their family had in the past belonged to a higher social class,[4] but investigations prove these stories unfounded.[4][5] Theories that Andersen may have been an illegitimate son of King Christian VII persist.[4]
Andersen's father, who had received an elementary education, introduced Andersen to literature, reading him Arabian Nights.[6] Andersen's mother, Anne Marie Andersdatter, was uneducated and worked as a washerwoman following his father's death in 1816, remarrying in 1818.[6] Andersen was sent to a local school for poor children where he received a basic education and was forced to support himself, working as a weaver's apprentice and, later, for a tailor. At 14, he moved to Copenhagen to seek employment as an actor. Having an excellent soprano voice, he was accepted into the Royal Danish Theatre, but his voice soon changed. A colleague at the theatre told him that he considered Andersen a poet. Taking the suggestion seriously, Andersen began to focus on writing.
Jonas Collin, director of the Royal Danish Theatre, felt a great affection for him, and sent him to a grammar school in Slagelse, persuading King Frederick VI to pay part of his education.[7] Andersen had already published his first story, The Ghost at Palnatoke's Grave, in 1822. Though not a keen student, he also attended school at Elsinore until 1827.[8]
He later said his years in school were the darkest and most bitter of his life. At one school, he lived at his schoolmaster's home. There he was abused in order "to improve his character," he was told. He later said the faculty had discouraged him from writing in general, causing him to enter a state of depression.
A very early fairy tale by Andersen called The Tallow Candle (Danish: Tællelyset) was discovered in a Danish archive in October 2012. The story, written in the 1820s, was about a candle who did not feel appreciated. It was written while he was still in school and dedicated to a benefactor, in whose family's possession it remained until it turned up among other family papers in a suitcase in a local archive.[9]
In 1829, Andersen enjoyed considerable success with a short story titled A Journey on Foot from Holmen's Canal to the East Point of Amager. In the book, the protagonist meets characters ranging from Saint Peter to a talking cat. He followed this success with a theatrical piece, Love on St. Nicholas Church Tower and a short volume of poems. Though he made little progress writing and publishing immediately thereafter, in 1833 he received a small traveling grant from the King, enabling him to set out on the first of many journeys through Europe. At Jura, near Le Locle, Switzerland, he wrote the story, Agnete and the Merman. He spent an evening in the Italian seaside village of Sestri Levante the same year, inspiring the name, The Bay of Fables.[10] In October 1834, he arrived in Rome. Andersen's travels in Italy would be reflected in his first novel; an autobiography titled The Improvisatore (Improvisatoren) which was published in 1835, receiving instant acclaim.
His initial attempts at writing fairy tales were revisions of stories that he heard as a child. Andersen brought this genre to a new level by writing a vast number of fairy tales that were both bold and original. Initially they were not met with recognition, due partly to the difficulty in translating them and capturing his genius for humor and dark pathos.
It was during 1835 that Andersen published the first two installments of his immortal Fairy Tales (Danish: Eventyr; lit. "fantastic tales"). More stories, completing the first volume, were published in 1837. The collection consists of nine tales that includes The Tinderbox, The Princess and the Pea, Thumbelina, The Little Mermaid and The Emperor's New Clothes. The quality of these stories was not immediately recognized, and they sold poorly. At the same time, Andersen enjoyed more success with two novels, O.T. (1836) and Only a Fiddler (1837); the latter was reviewed by the young Søren Kierkegaard.
After a visit to Sweden in 1837, Andersen became inspired by Scandinavism and committed himself to writing a poem that would convey the relatedness of Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians.[11] It was in July 1839 during a visit to the island of Funen that Andersen first wrote the text of his poem, Jeg er en Skandinav ("I am a Scandinavian").[11] Andersen composed the poem to capture "the beauty of the Nordic spirit, the way the three sister nations have gradually grown together," as part of a Scandinavian national anthem.[11] Composer Otto Lindblad set the poem to music, and the composition was published in January 1840. Its popularity peaked in 1845, after which it was seldom sung.[11] Andersen spent two weeks at the Augustenborg Palace in the autumn of 1844.[12]
Andersen returned to the fairy tale genre in 1838 with another collection, Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection. First Booklet (Eventyr, fortalte for Børn. Ny Samling), which consists of The Daisy, The Steadfast Tin Soldier and The Wild Swans.
The year 1845 heralded a breakthrough for Andersen with the publication of four different translations of his fairy tales. The Little Mermaid appeared in the periodical Bentley's Miscellany. It was followed by a second volume, Wonderful Stories for Children. Two other volumes enthusiastically received were A Danish Story Book and Danish Fairy Tales and Legends. A review that appeared in the London journal The Athenæum (February 1846) said of Wonderful Stories, "This is a book full of life and fancy; a book for grandfathers no less than grandchildren, not a word of which will be skipped by those who have it once in hand."[2]
In 1851, he published to wide acclaim In Sweden, a volume of travel sketches. A keen traveler, Andersen published several other long travelogues: Shadow Pictures of a Journey to the Harz, Swiss Saxony, etc. etc. in the Summer of 1831, A Poet's Bazaar, In Spain, and A Visit to Portugal in 1866. (The latter describes his visit with his Portuguese friends Jorge and Jose O'Neill, who were his fellows in the mid-1820s while living in Copenhagen.) In his travelogues, Andersen took heed of some of the contemporary conventions about travel writing, but always developed the genre to suit his own purposes. Each of his travelogues combines documentary and descriptive accounts of the sights he saw with more philosophical passages on topics such as being an author, immortality, and the nature of fiction in the literary travel report. Some of the travelogues, such as In Sweden, even contain fairy-tales.
In the 1840s, Andersen's attention returned to the stage, but with little success. He had better fortune with the publication of the Picture-Book without Pictures (1840). A second series of fairy tales began in 1838 and a third in 1845. Andersen was now celebrated throughout Europe, although his native Denmark still showed some resistance to his pretensions.
Between 1845 and 1864, H. C. Andersen lived at 67 Nyhavn, Copenhagen, where a memorial plaque now stands.[13]
In June 1847, Andersen paid his first visit to England and enjoyed a triumphal social success during the summer. The Countess of Blessington invited him to her parties where intellectual people could meet, and it was at one party that he met Charles Dickens for the first time. They shook hands and walked to the veranda which was of much joy to Andersen. He wrote in his diary, "We had come to the veranda, I was so happy to see and speak to England's now living writer, whom I love the most."[14]
The two authors respected each other's work and had something important in common as writers: Depictions of the poor and the underclass, who often had difficult lives affected both by the Industrial Revolution and by abject poverty. In the Victorian era there was a growing sympathy for children and an idealization of the innocence of childhood.
Ten years later, Andersen visited England again, primarily to visit Dickens. He extended a brief visit to Dickens' home at Gads Hill Place into a five-week stay, to the distress of Dickens' family. After Anderson was told to leave, Dickens stopped all correspondence between them, much to the great disappointment and confusion of Andersen, who had quite enjoyed the visit and never understood why his letters went unanswered.[14]
Andersen often fell in love with unattainable women and many of his stories are interpreted as references.[17] At one point, he wrote in his diary: "Almighty God, thee only have I; thou steerest my fate, I must give myself up to thee! Give me a livelihood! Give me a bride! My blood wants love, as my heart does!"[18] A girl named Riborg Voigt was the unrequited love of Andersen's youth. A small pouch containing a long letter from Riborg was found on Andersen's chest when he died, several decades after he first fell in love with her, and after he supposedly fell in love with others. Other disappointments in love included Sophie Ørsted, the daughter of the physicist Hans Christian Ørsted, and Louise Collin, the youngest daughter of his benefactor Jonas Collin. One of his stories, The Nightingale, was a written expression of his passion for Jenny Lind, and became the inspiration for her nickname, the "Swedish Nightingale". Andersen was often shy around women and had extreme difficulty in proposing to Lind. When Lind was boarding a train to take her to an opera concert, Andersen gave Lind a letter of proposal. Her feelings towards him were not the same; she saw him as a brother, writing to him in 1844 "farewell... God bless and protect my brother is the sincere wish of his affectionate sister, Jenny."[19]
Andersen wrote to Edvard Collin:[20] "I languish for you as for a pretty Calabrian wench... my sentiments for you are those of a woman. The femininity of my nature and our friendship must remain a mystery." Collin, who preferred women, wrote in his own memoir: "I found myself unable to respond to this love, and this caused the author much suffering." Likewise, the infatuations of the author for the Danish dancer Harald Scharff[21] and Carl Alexander, the young hereditary duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach,[22] did not result in any relationships.
In the spring of 1872, Andersen fell out of his bed and was severely hurt, never recovering. Soon after he started to show signs of liver cancer, and died on August 4, 1875, in a house called Rolighed (literally: calmness), near Copenhagen, the home of his close friends, the banker Moritz Melchior and his wife.[23] Shortly before his death, he had consulted a composer about the music for his funeral, saying: "Most of the people who will walk after me will be children, so make the beat keep time with little steps."[23] His body was interred in the Assistens Kirkegård in the Nørrebro area of Copenhagen. At the time of his death, Andersen was internationally treasured. The Danish Government paid him an annual stipend as a "national treasure". Even before his death, steps had already been taken to erect a large statue in his honor by sculptor August Saabye, which can now be seen in the Rosenborg Castle Gardens in Copenhagen.[3]
The "Hans Christian Andersen Awards" are given biennially by the International Board on Books for Young People to an author and illustrator whose complete works have made lasting contributions to children's literature.[24]
Andersen's stories laid the groundwork for other children's classics, such as Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame and Winnie the Pooh by A.A. Milne. The technique of making inanimate objects, such as toys, come to life (Little Ida's Flowers) would later be used by Lewis Carroll and Beatrix Potter.
April 2, Andersen's birthday, is celebrated as International Children's Book Day.[25] The year 2005, designated "Andersen Year" in Denmark,[26] was the bicentenary of Andersen's birth, and his life and work was celebrated around the world. In Denmark, a well-attended "once in a lifetime" show was staged in Copenhagen's Parken Stadium to celebrate the writer and his stories.[26]
A $13-million theme park based on Andersen's tales and life opened in Shanghai at the end of 2006.[27] Multi-media games and cultural contests related to the fairy tales are available to visitors. Andersen is said to have been celebrated because he was "a nice, hardworking person who was not afraid of poverty".[27] The Japanese city of Funabashi also has a children's theme park named after Andersen.[28]
In the United States, statues of Andersen may be found in New York City's Central Park, Chicago's Lincoln Park, and in Solvang, California, a city founded by Danes. The Library of Congress Rare Book and Special Collections Division was bequeathed an extensive collection of Andersen materials by the Danish-American actor, Jean Hersholt.[29] Of particular note is an original scrapbook Andersen prepared for the young Jonas Drewsen.[30]
He was played by Joachim Gottschalk in the 1941 Gerrman film The Swedish Nightingale which portrays his relationship with the singer Jenny Lind.
The 1952 American film Hans Christian Andersen, though inspired by Andersen's life and literary legacy, was meant to be neither historically nor biographically accurate; it begins by saying, "This is not the story of his life, but a fairy tale about this great spinner of fairy tales." A more accurate biographical treatment was attempted in Hans Christian Andersen: My Life as a Fairytale in 2003.
Andersen is a vital character in the Disney TV series The Little Mermaid's episode, "Metal Fish". Here, his inspiration for writing his tale The Little Mermaid is shown to have been granted by an encounter with the show's protagonists.
In 1966, Rankin/Bass Productions produced a fantasy film called The Daydreamer, which depicts the young Hans Christian Andersen imaginatively conceiving the stories he would later write.
"The Naked King" ("Голый Король (Goliy Korol)" 1937), "The Shadow" ("Тень (Ten)" 1940), and "The Snow Queen" ("Снежная Королева (Sniezhenaya Koroleva)" 1948) by Eugene Schwartz: reworked and adapted to the contemporary reality plays by one of Russia's playwrights. Schwartz's versions of "The Shadow" and "The Snow Queen" were later made into movies (1971 and 1966, respectively).
Sam the Lovesick Snowman at the Center for Puppetry Arts: a contemporary puppet show by Jon Ludwig inspired by The Snow Man.[31]

=======================================================
No collection of fairy tales would be complete without the works of the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen. In fact, Andersen's life was like a fairy tale in many ways. Out of the poverty, hardship, and loneliness of his youth, he came to be one of the most honored men of his time. Many of the more than 160 fairy tales he wrote, including "The Ugly Duckling," "The Princess and the Pea," and "The Little Mermaid," have become literary classics enjoyed by children and adults alike.
Andersen was born on April 2, 1805, in Odense, Denmark. His parents were poor; his father worked as a shoemaker and his mother was a washerwoman. His father, who died when Andersen was 11, entertained him with old Danish legends and stories from The Arabian Nights.
The people of Odense never knew what to make of the tall, awkward boy. When he recited long passages from plays or did a clumsy dance or insisted on singing, they could hardly help laughing. Everyone advised him to learn a trade, but this he would not do. He was forever saying that he was going to be famous.
In 1819, Andersen moved to the capital city of Copenhagen, where he hoped to become an actor in the Royal Theater. Many people of the theater and wealthy families of the city tried to help him, without much success. His dancing master gave up, and so did his singing teacher. Directors of the Royal Theater sympathized with his efforts to write plays but finally concluded that Andersen needed an education. One of the directors raised money to send him away to school. The next few years were the unhappiest of his life. Andersen was much older than the other students, and the schoolmaster found endless ways to make fun of him. Finally when word of Andersen's plight reached his benefactors in Copenhagen, he was removed from the school and put into the hands of a private tutor. He later attended and graduated from Copenhagen University.
After his schooling, Andersen spent many years traveling and writing poems, books, and plays, which met with some success. It was not until he was 30 that he wrote any fairy tales. His first small book of fairy tales became popular almost immediately, and from then on his fame grew rapidly, spreading from country to country.
Andersen put many pieces of his own life into his fairy tales. He never forgot that his mother as a young girl had been forced to go begging. This led him to write "The Little Match Girl," a story full of compassion for the unfortunate ones of this Earth. And his own personal experiences are reflected in "The Ugly Duckling," which points out that sometimes the qualities that make you feel lonely, different, and out of place are the very qualities that, when properly used, can make you shine.
In 1867 he returned to Odense to be honored by his country. Standing on the balcony of the hall where the ceremony was held, he saw below him the city square, full of people who cheered him, and bright with thousands of candles burning in the windows of all the buildings. Andersen published his last fairy tales in 1872, and after a long illness, he died in Copenhagen on August 4, 1875.

Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875), Danish author and poet, wrote many poems, plays, stories and travel essays, but is best known for his fairy tales of which there are over one hundred and fifty, published in numerous collections during his life and many still in print today.His first collection of Fairy Tales, Told for Children was published in 1835. He broke new ground for Danish literature with his style and use of idiom, irony and humor, memorable characters and un-didactic moral teaching inspired by the primitive folk tales he had learned as a child. Though they do not all end happily his Fairy Tales resound with an authenticity that only unabashed sincerity can produce from a man who could still see through a childs eyes;
 Thousands of lights were burning on the green branches, and gaily-colored pictures, such as she had seen in the shop-windows, looked down upon her. The little maiden stretched out her hands towards them when--the match went out. The lights of the Christmas tree rose higher and higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and formed a long trail of fire.  from The Little Match GirlAndersens fairy tales of fantasy with moral lessons are popular with children and adults all over the world, and they also contain autobiographical details of the man himself. Born on 2 April, 1805 in Odense, on the Danish island of Funen, Denmark, he was the only son of washerwoman Anna Maria Andersdatter (d.1833) and shoemaker Hans Andersen (d.1816). They were very poor, but Hans took his son to the local playhouse and nurtured his creative side by making him his own toys. Young Hans grew to be tall and lanky, awkward and effeminate, but he loved to sing and dance, and he had a vivid imagination that would soon find its voice.
After the death of his father, Andersen traveled to Copenhagen to pursue an acting career at the Royal Theatre. Under the patronage of the Theatres Jonas Collins, he attended the Copenhagen University which were formative but difficult years for him. Coming from a humble provincial background he had to adjust to bourgeois life in the capital city and competitive realm of the theatre. Collins daughter Louise and son Edvard were soon the objects of his affection. Andersen turned his pen to writing poems, plays and stories, his first poem The Dying Child published in the Copenhagen Post in 1827.The Improvisatore (1835) received international acclaim for Andersen, published by the University, and with this encouragement he set off on his literary career. Based in Italy, it is the story of young boys coming of age, not unlike Andersens own introduction into society. Many of Andersens plays including Love at St. Nicholas Tower and The Mulatto were performed at the Royal Theatre. He had a keen interest in other cultures and traveled extensively throughout Europe during his life and wrote a number of travel books including; A Walking Tour from the Holmen Canal to the Eastern Point of the Amager (1829); Shadow Pictures (1831), the result of his travels in Germany; O.T.: Life in Denmark (1836), and Pictures of Sweden (1851).Now that Andersen had achieved success by his pen he was not without his critics including philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, but fellow Dane Georg Brandis wrote his praises in many essays. He had met many other illustrious figures in his day including Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Honore de Balzac, Robert Browing and his wife and fellow poet and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, Heinrich Heine, Henrik Ibsen, Johannes Brahms, Richard Wagner, Franz Liszt, and Bertel Thorvaldsen. He stayed with friend Charles Dickens in London for a time, and was friends with the hereditary Grand Duke Carl Alexander of Saxony-Weimar-Eisenach. He received the Knighthood of the Red Eagle from King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia in 1846, and the Maximilian Order of Art and Science from King Maximilian II of Bavaria in 1859. He was made an Honorary Citizen of Odense in 1867. He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the newcomer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome. from The Ugly DucklingAfter suffering from liver cancer and in the care of his friends the Melchiors, Hans Christian Andersen died at their home on 4 August, 1875 in Copenhagen, Denmark. He lies buried in the Assistens Cemetery in the same city. First, you undergo such a terrible amount of suffering, and then you become famous.  from The Fairy Tale of My Life (1855).Other Andersen titles include;Only a Fiddler (1837),A Poets Bazaar (1842),A Christmas Greeting to my English Friends (1847),The Two Baronesses (1848),To Be or Not To Be (1857), and New Tales and Stories (1858-59).Biography written by C.D.

hey, i have an original copy of hans christian andersons first 2 works that happen to be signed by the queen of england at that time.
What do you think about the story ''The bottle 's neck''.I really love it,but I can't not find out the full meaning of this story.
I find this tale quite charming. I suspect it may have a deeper meaning lurking beneath the surface. Any thoughts? :cool:
Hallo... since it seems as though there haven't been a fun discussion about any of his works, I would like to start one.. 
Is he another one of those fairy tale writers that have toned down the actual story so that it is more appropriate to children?

In 1874, the year before he died, Hans Christian Andersen was perhaps better known than any other living writer, an international celebrity somewhere on a level with Charles Dickens.  Even people who were not quite sure of his name were aware of his writing – in particular his "Tales, told for children," the fairytales, first published in the early 1830s.  Some of these stories are so famous that they seem to almost to exist without an author.	  
Consider just some of the most celebrated stories: "The Ugly Duckling," "The Emperor's New Clothes," "The Princess on the Pea," "The Nightingale," "The Red Shoes," "The Little Match Girl," "Thumbelina," and "The Little Mermaid." All in all, he wrote about a hundred and fifty of them, and while all are not equally good – and many are really not meant for children – all of them are told in Andersen's special satirical, comical, and sympathetic voice. And all of them are in some way about Andersen himself, whose own story is at least as strange as his tales. He called his autobiography "The Fairytale of My Life," and the title is apt.	    
Andersen (no one ever called him "Hans") was born in the town of Odense, on the Danish island of Fyn, in 1805. He was a solitary boy who amused himself by playing with puppets and trying to write plays. He grew up in extreme poverty and was obsessed with a desire to become famous, even if he wasn't quite sure of the path to fame.  He left home at the age of fourteen, setting off for Copenhagen, the Danish capital, and he never looked back. He had the enormous good fortune to be noticed by a prosperous and socially prominent family, the Collins, who helped get him an education.  Andersen considered them his family – his own father had died when Andersen was eleven, his mother was a drunk –  and although he tried the Collins' patience, they stood by him, never imagining that this strange, overly sensitive and strikingly ugly young man would become world famous.

=======================================================
With captivating stories that have filled joy in the hearts of millions of children worldwide time and time again, Hans Christian Andersen is remembered as one of the most creative and widely read fairy tales author to live.  Although Andersen was also a novelist, poet, playwright and essayist, his fairy tales became his identity and his greatest contribution to world literature.
Andersen was born to a low class poor family on April 2, 1805 in Odense, Denmark. His father was a shoemaker and his mother contributed to the family income by washing clothes of other people. Being an only child, Andersen was spoiled by his parents who allowed him to develop his imagination by making him his own toys. Hans grew up with a love for singing and dancing. His tall and bony figure made him appear a little awkward.  Hans, however, least cared about this and stayed engrossed in his colorful imagination.
Andersen’s father died when he was eleven. Three years later, Hans left for Copenhagen with an ambition to join the Royal Theatre and become a stage artist. Although he was not able to make it to the Royal Theatre without references, Jonas Collins, a director of The Royal Theatre supported him by arranging a scholarship to obtain basic education. However, Andersen never proved to be a good student and was weak at spelling and writing well. This is probably why his writing style was simplistic with everyday spoken language.  After seven tough years at school, Andersen graduated from university in 1828. His first poem The Dying Child was published in the Copenhagen Post a year before his graduation.
Travelling through Italy in 1833 and his own life inspired The Improvisatore (1835), Andersen’s first novel to obtain international acclaim. The success encouraged Andersen’s literary carrier and he wrote five more novels which unfortunately did not do well since Hans was a better playwright than a novelist. Other than his cherished fairy tales some of his more surviving contributions to Danish literature include an autobiography and travelogues.
Fairy tales were Andersen’s forte. Some of his most defining tales were written between 1835 and 1850. These included the famous The Princess on the Pea (1835), Thumbelina (1835), The Steadfast Tin Soldier (1838), The Snow Queen (1844), The Darning Needle (1845), The Little Match Girl (1845), and The Shirt Collar (1848). Andersen’s tales are full of emotions and heartbreaking ordeals his characters go through before settling in a happily ever after. The world around the character is often cold and cruel. It is believed, many of Andersen’s tales carry in them an autobiographic element. The Ugly Duckling for example is the story of an ugly cygnet who transforms into a beautiful swan like Andersen himself who suffered a childhood of poverty and unattractiveness but later became a successful person. His stories also reveal his distrust for authority, something he developed during his struggling years in Copenhagen. With a writing style and language focusing on child readers, Andersen’s fairy tales revolve around adult themes and are therefore enjoyable by both.
Before his death on August 4, 1875, Andersen was a renowned writer. He was regarded as a national treasure by the Danish government and also given a stipend. A statue was erected in Rosenborg Garden, Copenhagen to honor this legendary writer.
