=======================================================
Monica Bellucci (Italian pronunciation: [ˈmɔːnika belˈluttʃi], born 30 September 1964),[1] is an Italian actress and fashion model.
Bellucci was born in Città di Castello, Umbria, Italy[2][3] as the only child of Brunella Briganti and Pasquale Bellucci, and she grew up in San Giustino.
Monica Bellucci began modelling at age 13 by posing for a local photo enthusiast.[4] In 1988, Bellucci moved to one of Europe's fashion centres, Milan, where she signed with Elite Model Management. By 1989, she was becoming prominent as a fashion model in Paris and across the Atlantic, in New York City. She posed for Dolce & Gabbana and French Elle, among others. In that year, Bellucci made the transition to acting and began taking acting classes. The February 2001 Esquire's feature on Desire featured Bellucci on the cover and in an article on the five senses. In 2003, she was featured in Maxim.[5] Men's Health also named her one of the "100 Hottest Women of All-Time", ranking her at No. 21.[6] AskMen named her the number one most desirable woman in 2002.[7]
Bellucci's modelling career is managed by Elite+ in New York City. She is considered an Italian sex symbol.[8][9] From 2006 to 2010 she was the face of a range of Dior products.[10] Bellucci is signed to D'management group in Milan and also to Storm Model Management in London.[11]
In 2004, while pregnant with her daughter Deva, Bellucci posed nude for the Italian Vanity Fair Magazine in protest against Italian laws, that prevent the use of donor sperm.[12] She posed pregnant and semi-nude again for the magazine's April 2010 issue.[13]
Bellucci's film career began in the early 1990s. She played some minor roles in La Riffa (1991) and Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992). In 1996 she was nominated for a César Award for best supporting actress for her portrayal of Lisa in The Apartment[15] and strengthened her position as an actress. She became known and popular with worldwide audiences, following her roles in Malèna (2000), Brotherhood of the Wolf, "Under Suspicion",[16] and Irréversible (2002). She has since played in many films from Europe and Hollywood like Tears of the Sun (2003), The Matrix Reloaded (2003), The Passion of the Christ (2004), The Brothers Grimm (2005), Le Deuxième souffle (2007), Don't Look Back (2009), and The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010).
She was supposed to be seen portraying Indian politician Sonia Gandhi in the biopic Sonia, originally planned for release in 2007, but it has been shelved.[17] Bellucci dubbed her own voice for the French and Italian releases of the film Shoot 'Em Up (2007).[18] She also voiced Kaileena in the video game Prince of Persia: Warrior Within, and the French voice of Cappy for the French version of the 2005 animated film Robots.
Empire magazine selected her as twenty-first on their list of "The Sexiest 25 Characters in Cinema - The Women" for her role of "Persephone" in the Matrix series.[19]
Bellucci met French actor Vincent Cassel on the set of their 1996 film The Apartment.[20] They married in 1999,[20] and have two daughters, Deva (born 2004) and Léonie (born 2010).[21][22] Bellucci and Cassel announced their separation in August 2013.[20]
In the documentary movie The Big Question, about the film The Passion of the Christ, she stated: "I am an agnostic, even though I respect and am interested in all religions. If there's something I believe in, it's a mysterious energy; the one that fills the oceans during tides, the one that unites nature and beings."[23]
In September 2012 at a Toronto International Film Festival press conference for the Iranian movie Rhino Season, Bellucci stated that she can speak four languages: Italian, French, English and (some) Persian.[24]

      Doesn't always live with her husband Vincent Cassel, for avoiding routine, the two live in separate apartments. she lives most of the time in Rome and he lives in Paris.
      Bellucci is a typical surname from center Italy, it comes from the Latin word "Bellutus", and has the same root as surnames like Belluto, Belluti, Belluzzo, Belluccio, or the aristocratic surname of Belluzzi.
      She has said in an interview that Sophia Loren and Claudia Cardinale have inspired her acting career.

      Shares birthday with fellow actresses Deborah Kerr, Angie Dickinson, Marion Cotillard and actor Ezra Miller.
      My body is so important to me... my face, my arms, my legs, my hands, my eyes, everything. I use everything I have.
      "I didn't have familiarity with children. I'm learning day after day, with her. And what impress me the most is that she, Deva, is an individual person. But in miniature, she seems to be a special effect." talking about her daughter Deva.
      It is a handicap if you're stupid, but not if you are intelligent and know how to use your beauty.
      I feel fine and comfortable with myself, but not because I'm beautiful. I know many beautiful people and their lives are just so terrible. They feel so uncomfortable with themselves. Being comfortable is not about what you look like, but how you feel. I'm a lucky person because I've been loved a lot. I have a great family.
      "Vincent was so incredible, so sweet. When we went to Cannes for the film, you know the moment when I come out from the tunnel and we see me for the first time completely with blood all over, he was crying. I said, 'Vincent, come on. It's just a movie. We know it's not real." (on her husband's support when Irréversible (2002) was released).
      As a European, I need to stay in Europe and I make Italian movies, French movies. Then to come to America is something interesting for me.
      "I think this is something that touches every country - America, Italy, France, England, all over. You will see all these people, they don't know how to sing, they don't know how to dance, and still they become famous. You know, just celebrities. And I think this is a very dangerous process." (about real TV).
      This is what I like about America, because you have very big budget movie, and also independent movies, so you have many different choices. But I know that I'm European... Being European, it is not easy to find the right project, because you may look different, you sound different, and you have to find the right character.
      As a woman I am so curious about prostitutes because of the idea that they know men better than you. Also, it's such a strange way to live. But at the same time there are prostitutes who just want to be prostitutes, and this is this woman, nobody pushed her to do it. She's a prostitute because she wants to be a prostitute. It's her philosophy of life.
      "I'm not scared by nudity, because for me, nothing is more beautiful than a body. You can have such an amazing emotion from a body. In Irréversible (2002), I treated my body like it was an object and it's great when you can have this kind of relation with your body, it's a part of your job, an object you can work with. When you can have this kind of freedom it's the moment where you can give your best as an actress".
      In 10 years I've done so many things. In the beginning I didn't know if I was still a model, if I was an actress. I knew I wanted to be an actress, but it was so difficult to be believed. Now things are going better and better and the proposals I have are much more interesting than five years ago. It's like getting older is getting better.
      Maybe the reason I work a lot is because each director thinks that I'll be better with him. Maybe the moment where I'll be completely accepted I won't work any more.
      [Talking about why she will not move to Hollywood to further her film career]: "I could never live there. They are obsessed with youth and beauty even more than us. There is this thing in America where actresses reach 40 and go mad. The film industry wants all these young people. They also like a different sort of woman (to me). I will never be skinny. I also had a child a year ago, and I have been lazy. I love to eat. Who cares? I am natural."
      I am at a stage in my life where if I don't go out, I don't feel I'm missing something. I get bored surrounded by people smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol. And I'm not so interested now in going to premieres or being photographed on the red carpet. I want to be with my daughter.
      I am an agnostic, even though I respect and am interested in all religions. If there's something I believe in, it's a mysterious energy; the one that fills the oceans during tides, the one that unites nature and beings.
=======================================================
Born in Cittadi Castello, Umbria, Italy, Monica Bellucci came from relatively humble beginnings and was the daughter of Maria Gustinelli, a painter, and Luigi Bellucci, who owned a trucking company.
She began modelling at the age of 16, in order to pay her tuition at the University of Perugia, where she was studying law. She soon gave up her studies to pursue a career in show business.
During her time as a model she has worked for the likes of Dolce and Gabbana, as well as Dior and French Elle. Bellucci has also appeared on the cover of numerous magazines and in 2004 came top of AskMen's 100 Most Beautiful Women in the World list.
She speaks Italian, French, and English fluently, Spanish semi-fluently, and has appeared in films speaking each of these languages, as well as in Aramaic for her part as Mary Magdalene in ‘The Passion of the Christ’.
Bellucci has played parts in many foreign language films, including ‘L’Appartement’, for which she won a Cesar Award for best supporting actress. She has also appeared in some big budget Hollywood films, such as ‘Bram Stoker’s Dracula’ in 1992, although she is perhaps most remembered for her role in 2003’s ‘The Matrix Reloaded’.
She is married to ‘Black Swan’s Vincent Cassel. The couple have appeared in several films together and have two children. In a recent interview with the Sunday Times Style magazine, Bellucci hinted that she realises her husband may not always be faithful to her, although she suggested she was OK with that. She said: “It would be ridiculous to ask [fidelity] of him if I hadn’t been there for two months. You can’t ask such things as who has he been seeing, what has he been up to? It is more respectful and realistic to take the view that you’ll be with me when I see you.”
Bellucci said that she still finds her husband sexy, although she admitted that despite loving him “sometimes [she] wants to kill him”. She recently confirmed that her latest role will be in a political film by Iranian director Bahman Ghobadi entitled ‘Rhinos Season’. In an interview about the film for Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Bellucci described it as “a great love story”.
Bellucci has continued to act over the last decade, appearing in 'The Brothers Grimm' in 2005 and 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' in 2010, among others. She is set to appear in a number of films in 2011, including 'Manual of Love 3', 'Guardian of the Harem' and 'That Summer'. Bellucci has two children (Deva and Leonie) with her husband Vincent Cassell. The youngest was born in 2010. She posed nude for the Italian Vanity Fair magazine during both of her pregnancies.

Monica Anna Maria Bellucci was born on September 30, 1964, in Selci Lama, a small hamlet near CittĂ  di Castello, Italy. Her father, Pasquale Bellucci, worked in a transport agency and was always travelling around, while her mother, Brunella Brigante, 19 years old at the time, stayed home and took care of their daughter.Â  As a child, Monica was very shy and not at ease played with other children, probably because she didn’t have any brother or sister. But she had a beautiful childhood, according to her memories of a caring mother and a loving father.
“I had wonderful parents who always let me free and with whom I could talk about everything – little crushes, love stories, sex, everything. I had a wonderful childhood because of this great relashionship with my parents. My mother was caring and sweet, always there for me. My dad adored me, he spoiled me and was always telling me that I was the most beautiful girl in the world. Maybe that’s why I grew up with such self-confidence”
Ever since she was a teenager, she was considered as “the beauty of the village” and everyone couldn’t help but notice her when she walked with her friends in the streets of CittĂ  di Castello city center. Monica was always quite a good student, giving her best in literary subjects, and she graduated from Liceo Classico Plinio il Giovane. Then she immediately moved to Perugia to attend law school at university. She would have preferred studying philosophy, but she told herself that with a law degree it would be easier to find a job and settle down.
Modeling began as a way of paying her tuition and it occasionally brought her to Milan, the Italian fashion capital. Soon this activity was stealing a major part of her time, so Monica decided to follow her independent soul and moved there in order to become a professional model, landing in a few months a contract with Elle Management agency and a cover on prestigious magazine Elle. 
“At 19 years old, spending eight hours a day on books seemed crazy to me, when I could do a gratifying and well-paid job as being a model. It was my curiosity to discover the world [that made me leave Umbria]. I was like a little bird that leaves the nest when it feels ready.”
The catwalk gave her the opportunity to travel around the world and through it she met her first husband, photographer Claudio Carlos Basso, from whom she later separated and divorced. “There is nothing extraordinary in a marriage that comes an end. We remained very good friends and I admire him very much.” Monica became an international top model. Dolce & Gabbana elected her as the icon of the Mediterranean woman for a series of advertisements and she was immortalized by Richard Avedon for Revlon campaign “Most Beautiful Women”. But all this was not what Monica wanted for her life. She started dreaming about being an actress.
The occasion to fulfill the dream came thanks to the encounter with Enrico and Carlo Vanzina. Impressed by the intense expression in her eyes and by her breathtaking beauty, they introduced Monica to Dino Risi, one of greatest Italian directors of all times. This way, in 1990 she got casted for her first role in Risi’s tv film Vita Coi Figli. After starring alongside Giancarlo Giannini in her television debut and a small part in Briganti, she obtained two major roles in La Riffa and in Ostinato Destino. Critics didn’t spare her harsh reviews, labelling her as yet another model turned actress. But Monica didn’t give up. In 1992 Francis Ford Coppola personally chose her to play one of the vampire brides in his Dracula. It was Monica’s first landing in Hollywood. In 1994, she starred in I Mitici by Carlo Vanzina, while 1995 saw her opposite to Ben Kingsley in Joseph, a Tv Rai/USA production by Robert Young.
Frustrated by the situation of movie industry in Italy, 1996 Monica moved to France, country that adopted her more than willingly. L’Appartement represented a huge turning point not only for her career, but also for her personal life. Her performance in the successful romantic drama by Gilles Mimouni was awarded with a nomination for a CĂŠsar, the French equivalent to the Oscar, and on set she met Vincent Cassel, with whom she fell deeply in love. Monica kept working incessantly both in Italy and in France, sharing screen with Vincent in several occasions: Dobermann (1997), Come Mi Vuoi (1997), Compromis (1998), MĂŠditerranĂŠes (1999), to name a few.
On August 3, 1999 Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci finally got married in Monte Carlo, France. Eight years later, in 2007, Monica recalled the moment Vincent asked her to marry him:
“It was one of the most romantic moments of my life. He gave me a lift from airport, stopped the car in the middle of the street and gave me a ring.Â  I said ‘thank you’, he said ‘since you’ll be gone for three months I just wanted to make you a present’. Then he stood for a moment and then he laughed and added ‘just joking, actually I wanted to ask you to marry me’. It was impossibile to say no”.
2000 was a fantastic year for Monica’s career. She was casted to play the alluring and seducing wife of Gene Hackman in Under Suspicion, thriller made in Hollywood starring Morgan Freeman as well. Back in Italy, she took the leading role in Giuseppe Tornatore‘s latest movie, MalĂ¨na. Tornatore had already directed her in a series of commercials for D&G and had decided to base an entire drama on her astonishing figure. MalĂ¨na was a huge success, in Italy and abroad, where Monica was unanimously acclaimed and consacrated as one of the most promising international actresses.
In 2001 Le Pacte des Loups by Christophe Gans was released in France theaters, becoming immediately a cult movie. The same approval would greet it later in other European countries and in the United States, brining even more visibility to Monica. AstĂŠrix & ObĂŠlix: Mission ClĂŠopĂ˘tre, that came out a year later and in which she played an irresistible and capricious Queen of the Nile, was another unbelievable hit and France most profitable comedy ever. 2002′s Cannes Film Festival received with mixed reactions Gaspar NoĂŠ’s scandalous Irreversible, mostly because of the disturbingly realistic eight-minute rape scene, whose shootings constituted a real challenge for Monica. Cannes Film Festival, by the way, gave her another chance to shine: she was chosen as 2003 edition’s godmother.
In 2003, Italy got the chance to admire her in family drama Ricordati di Me by the talented and acclaimed director of “The Last Kiss” Gabriele Muccino. Wachowski brothers watched MalĂ¨na during a plane flight and decided to audition and cast her as femme fatale Persephone in the final two chapters of Matrix trilogy, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, that along with war movie Tears of the Sun, opposite Bruce Willis, amounted to another great chance to get known in the US.
2004 was an exciting year for Monica Bellucci. Although her agent strongly suggested her not to accept the part because of the lack of interested distributors, Monica appeared as Mary Magdalene in Mel Gibson’s controversial The Passion of the Christ. The film was a worldwide unexpected winner at 2004′s box office, and it was followed by Spike Lee’s She Hate Me in which Monica plays a small part as the lesbian daughter of John Turturro’s character. After filming Agents Secrets, their last film together, a new challenge was on the way for the Bellucci-Cassel couple: they started planning for a family.
“I had never really thought about having children, actually I wasn’t even sure I wanted to. I visited my friends with children and when I left their home I was happy I didn’t have kids too. Then all of a sudden it hit me like a truck – I was on the set of The Passion of the Christ and Maya Morgestern was pregnant, I looked at her and at the kids around me with different eyes and then I realized I was ready and that I wanted my body to fulfill its functions, not only to look good in dresses”.
Deva Cassel was born on September 12, 2004 at the Fatebenefratelli hospital in Rome, Italy. While seven months pregnant with Deva, Monica posed nude for the Italian Vanity Fair magazine, raising her voice against Italian laws that prevent the use of donor sperm. Three months later she was again on Vanity Fair’s cover – this time with her newborn daughter, stating that she intended to take a break from acting. She took, in fact, a little time off from acting in movies and agreed with Vincent not to engage in common projects for a while in order to never leave Deva alone. But somehow they managed to find some time for a new project: the French dub for acclaimed Pixar movie “Robots”, starring Vincent Cassel as the voice of Rodney and Monica Bellucci as the voice of Cappy. Actually this wasn’t Monica’s first experience at dubbing cartoons: in 2003 she had been theÂ  French voice for Marina in “Sinbad”.
By the way,Â  by February 2005, five months after giving birth, she was ready to work again, starting with filming Bertrand Blier’s Combien Tu M’imes?, a romantic comedy that had her playing as a high-suburb prostitute with all men at her feet:
“I switched from mother to prostitute, from prostitute to mother: I had my child waiting for me in the trailer while I was filming, and when the director called off the filming of these sexyÂ  scenes I rushed to the trailer in order to breastfeed Deva. It was crazy but it was also interesting”.
Monica was back on screens in 2005 with The Brothers Grimm (filmed in 2003 in Prague) by visionary Terry Gilliam – in which she played the wicked Mirror Queen – presented at the Venice Film Festival, and in early 2006 with Combien Tu M’Aimes?. Perfectly balancing career and motherhood, Monica found enough time to work on a lot of projects: after a friendly cameo as a vampiresse in Kim Chapiron’s Sheitan (starring Vincent Cassel), filming for Italian/French production N – Io & Napoleone by Italian director Paolo VirzĂŹ started in August 2005 in Tuscany, Italy. N – Io & Napoleone was followed by Le Concile De Pierre, a film by Guillaume Nicloux, based on a novel by Jean-Christopher GrangĂŠ (“The Crimson Rivers”). Though it didn’t hit the box offices and went almost unnoticed in France and in Italy,Â  Le Concile The Pierre can be considered one of Bellucci’s best works: her acting is perfect, intense and emotional, and impressed the audience at the first edition of Rome Film Festival in October 2006, together with VirzĂŹ’s movie, another milestone in Monica’s career.
In the meantime her age (close to 45) and motherhood didn’t scare Bernard Fornas and John Galliano, who chose her as official ambassadress for Cartier and beauty icon for Dior makeup: in 2006 and in the years later she flew from a country to another for the opening of new Cartier luxury stores, while her beautiful face was all over the cities to promote the latest Dior beauty products. In 2007 the partnership with Cartier became even bigger when the Italian diva was asked to design her own line of jewelry: classic necklaces and earrings in white gold, pearls and diamonds were part of the brand new Monica Bellucci Collection.
2006 was also the year of the great come back to Cannes Film Festival: after being the godmother back in 2003, she was chosen as member of the jury representing Italy, together with Helena Bonham-Carter (UK), Zhang Ziyi (China), Samuel L. Jackson (USA), Tim Roth (UK), Patrice Leconte (France), Elia Suleman (Palestine), Lucrecia Martel (Argentina) and Wong Kar-Wai (China, also President of the jury). While working with the jury she also took the opportunity to present her latest project, a French noir movie directed by Alain Corneau and starring Bellucci and Daniel Auteil: Le DeuxiĂ¨me Souffle. Right after Cannes Film Festival Monica flew to Italy for the filming of Manuale D’Amore 2 – Capitoli Successivi, which ended up being a huge success at Italian box offices also because of aÂ  huge promotion that was built around the on-screen relashioship between Italy’s most famous actress Monica Bellucci and Italian teenagers’ favourite loverboy Riccardo Scamarcio.
After the release of Shoot ‘Em Up, Michael Davis’ “rock and roll thriller” starring Monica and Clive Owen, in 2007 Monica Bellucci was approached again by director Gabriele Muccino (who directed her in 2003 in Ricordati di Me), who later directed her in a short movie for Italian TV: HearTango was a 10 minutes commercial for underwear brand Intimissimi in which Monica played 7 short different characters representing 7 different kinds of woman.
In 2008 Monica Bellucci was the star of several French and Italian productions: “Sanguepazzo” by Marco Tullio Giordana, originally made for TV, was premiered in Cannes and released in May and “L’Uomo che Ama” by Maria Sole Tognazzi was released in October: both movies were a great opportunity to show Italian audience her acting skills.Â  “Ne Te Retourne Pas” by Marina De Van, a psychological thriller, had Monica sharing the screen with the legendary French fellow actress Sophie Marceau and was premiered in Cannes and released in May 2009. “Ne Te Retourne Pas” was followed byÂ  Rebecca Miller’s “The Private Lives of Pippa Lee”, released in the UK during the summer of 2009. Monica’s character, sultry Gigi Lee,Â  didn’t have much time on screen but gave her the opportunity to share the experience with legendary and talented actresses such as Robin Wright Penn, Winona Ryder, Maria Bello, Alan Arkin and Julianne Moore.
It was time to get back to the United States. In June 2009 Monica joined Nicolas Cage and Jay Baruchel for Disney’s “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice”,Â  as the witch and long time love of Nicolas Cage’s character, Veronica.Â  In the meantime, almost ten years after MalĂ¨na, Giuseppe TornatoreÂ  and Monica Bellucci reunited for “BaarĂŹa” (filmed back in 2008), the Italian epic movie about the director’s childhood memories. Though Monica’s part was a five-seconds cameo as a bricklayer’s girlfriend, the movie, released in September 2009, received much praise from the audiences from all the world and was nominated as best foreign picture at the Golden Globes 2010. Her last work of 2009 was “Omaggio a Roma”, a 20 minutes short film made for TV in order to promote the city of Rome. “Omaggio a Roma” was directed by the internationally acclaimed and legendary Franco Zeffirelli, starring Monica Bellucci and singer Andrea Bocelli as Tosca and lover Mario. Monica Bellucci was expected to be in Venice for the premiere of “BaarĂŹa” and in Rome for the premiere of “Omaggio a Roma”, but she didn’t show up. Nobody knew that she was, in fact, expecting her second child.
Rumours started to swirl months later, in November 2009, when sources from the MediaPro Studios in Bucharest stated that Monica Bellucci was three months pregnant while shooting “The Whistleblower”, a movie starring Rachel Weisz and Vanessa Redgrave and directed by a first time director, Larysa Kondracki. Her rep didn’t confirm the news. It took the Cassel-Bellucci family three months to share the happy news: in February 2010 Vincent Cassel confirmed that they were expecting, and a month later Monica broke her silence with a photoshoot featured on italian Vanity Fair, while 8 months pregnant.
On May 20, 2010 Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel welcomedÂ  in Rome (Italy) their second child: a daughter named LĂŠonie.

 Film critics are quick to compare Monica Bellucci to previous Italian beauties, but she is her own brand of sultry icon. With roles as a topless vampire in Bram Stoker's Dracula, a taciturn war widow in MalÃ¨na (2000), a charmed courtesan in Le Pacte des Loups (Brotherhood of the Wolf) (2002), and a sci-fi vixen in the Matrix sequels (2003), Bellucci has proved to be a bold blend of earthy and ethereal, actress and star.
Born on September 30, 1968, Bellucci grew up in the small Italian village of Citta di Castello, where her father owned a trucking company. At 18, she enrolled at the University of Perugia with plans to study law. To pay her tuition, Bellucci started modeling. Two years later, she dropped out of school to relocate to Milan, where she signed with Elite Model Management. Besides strutting the cat walk in fashion shows, Bellucci appeared in international advertising campaigns for designers such as Dolce & Gabbana. With her modeling career in full swing, she began to take acting classes and made her screen debut in the television film Vita Coi Figli (Life With the Sons) in 1990.
After acting in several Italian features, Bellucci graced American screens for the first time as one of Dracula's (Gary Oldman) brides in Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), which also starred Keanu Reaves and Winona Ryder. She subsequently returned to Italy to appear in the heist film I Mitici (The Heroes) (1994) and the children's movie Palla di Neve (Snowball) (1995). As time passed, Bellucci grew increasingly frustrated with the failure of Italy's film industry to promote its projects abroad. She starred opposite Ben Kingsley and Dominique Sanda in the American television movie Joseph (1995), before looking for work in French films.
Bellucci made her French-language debut in 1996's award-winning romance L'Appartement (The Apartment). She earned a CÃ©sar nomination for her performance in the role, as well as began dating her co-star, French actor Vincent Cassel. The couple (who married a few years later) re-teamed onscreen immediately, portraying comically troubled lovers in the gender-bending romance Come Mi Vuoi (As You Want Me) (1996) and murderous bank robbers in Jan Kounen's infamous thriller Dobermann (1997).
In 2000, Bellucci returned to Hollywood to play Gene Hackman's estranged trophy wife in Under Suspicion. The film's director, Stephen Hopkins, had seen L'Appartement on a transatlantic flight and requested that she star in the thriller. That same year, the actress earned unprecedented worldwide acclaim for her performance as the title character in MalÃ¨na. Helmed by award-winning director Giuseppe Tornatore, the film featured Bellucci as a quiet young bride who is left alone in a small Sicilian town when her husband goes off to fight in World War II. Stunningly attractive, she struggles to keep her dignity as she is spurned by the female villagers and preyed upon by the men. Bellucci followed up MalÃ¨na's success with another international hit, Christophe Gans' genre hybrid Le Pacte des Loups (Brotherhood of the Wolf) (2002). The stylish cross between period piece and kung-fu flick (which also starred Cassel) was the fourth most successful film of its year in France. After conquering Europe, the film became an art house hit in the States and Bellucci received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress from the U.S. Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror Films.
The subject of numerous fan sites and men's magazine articles, Bellucci went on to star as the seductive Queen of the Nile in the comic book adaptation AstÃ©rix & ObÃ©lisk: Mission ClÃ©opÃ¢tre. In 2001, she joined Dracula co-star Keanu Reeves in the cast of the highly anticipated follow-ups to The Matrix (1999), The Matrix Reloaded (2003) and The Matrix Revolutions (2003). Soon after, Bruce Willis personally chose Bellucci to play a humanitarian doctor whom he must save from war-torn Nigeria in Tears of the Sun, director Antoine Fuqua's follow-up to his hit Training Day (2001).
In 2004, Bellucci's momentum continued to build when she starred as Mary Magdalene in The Passion of the Christ, Mel Gibson's self-produced blockbuster retelling of the final 12 hours of Jesus Christ. In the wake of that film's success, Bellucci teamed with two other renowned directors, Terry Gilliam and Spike Lee, with roles in The Brothers Grimm and She Hate Me, respectively.
She continued to work steadily with high profile projects as The Brothers Grimm, the action film Shoot 'Em Up, and the family fantasy film The Sorcerer's Apprentice. ~ Aubry Anne D'Arminio, Rovi

Born in the Italian town of Citta di Castello, Monica Bellucci idolized screen icons such as Sophia Loren and Gina Lolabrigida while she was growing up. Although she originally studied law, a friend persuaded her to try modeling in order to earn some extra money for school. However, Bellucci began to land so many modeling jobs that she had to drop out of college,especially when she was chosen by director Dino Risi to appear in his TV movie Vita Coi Figli (1990) after seeing her photo in a magazine. She appeared in two more Italian productions before coming to the attention of American director Francis Ford Coppola, who cast her in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992). Although the movie was filmed in the States, she soon returned to Italy to appear in numerous films in her native land.
In 1996, Bellucci won international acclaim when she appeared in the French film, L'appartement(1996), receiving a Caesar nomination (the French equivalent of the Academy Awards) for her performance. She fell in love with her co-star, French actor Vincent Cassel, and the two were not only married in 1999 but have co-starred in several more films since. For the next few years, she did mostly French productions, but took time out to make an English language filmthe France/US co-production Under Suspicion (2000), starring Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman. 
In Tears of the Sun (2003), Bellucci landed her first starring role in a major Hollywood motion picture, playing a doctor in a foreign land who refuses to leave the people she is treating when a Navy lieutenant (Bruce Willis) comes to the rescue. She next played a leading role opposite Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne in the dual sequels The Matrix Reloaded (2003) and The Matrix Revolutions (2003). In Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ (2004) she played the role of Mary Magdalene. More recent credits include The Private Lives of Pippa Lee (2009) directed by Rebecca Miller and The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010), starring alongside Nicolas Cage.

"It doesn't mean anything, beauty. I mean, if I see a beautiful man, maybe I am surprised for three seconds, but then if I speak with him and he's completely stupid, I don't see his beauty anymore." - Monica Bellucci
                After roles in a list of Italian and French films like Malena (2000) and Irreversible (2002), Monica Bellucci struck gold as Persephone in The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. She's sustained her presence stateside with roles in The Passion of the Christ (2004), Shoot 'Em Up (2007), and The Private Lives of Pippa Lee (2009). 2010 is actually Bellucci’s most prominent year to date in English-language films, with The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, opposite Nicolas Cage and Jay Baruchel; The Whistleblower, opposite Rachel Weisz; and Joel Schumacher’s 1:30 Train. Did we mention that she’s 45?            
                It’s hard to envision Monica Bellucci without instantly conjuring naughty thoughts, and there’s little doubt that she deserves all the salacious sentiments that have been hurled her way over the years. It’s also worth noting that unlike a lot of her contemporaries, Monica Bellucci has only become more attractive and alluring as time has passed.  A textbook example of the whole MILF phenomenon, Monica Bellucci has managed to retain her hourglass figure without the assistance of plastic surgery (as far as we can tell). It’s no surprise to note, then, that Monica Bellucci has become a staple of AskMen.com's Top 99 list over the years, having peaked in 2002 with a ranking of No. 1. She also ranked No. 18 in 2007, No. 22 in 2008 and No. 18 again in 2009.            
                Undoubtedly the hottest Italian import since Sophia Loren, Monica Bellucci has attained the sort of respect that most models can only dream about. Having appeared in almost 50 movies and television shows, Monica Bellucci’s status within the industry -- both in North America and abroad -- is nothing short of remarkable (though far from surprising, given her  talent).  Monica’s penchant for blending her English-language work with roles in her native Italian continued in 2008, as she was scheduled to appear in French, Italian and American movies. 1:30 Train, teamed the actress up with director Joel Schumacher and cast her as a vulnerable woman who is forced to fend for herself on the mean streets of New York City after her purse is stolen.            
                Monica Anna Maria Bellucci was born on September 30, 1964, in Perugia, Italy. The daughter of a painter and a businessman, Monica grew up with dreams of becoming a lawyer -- though it eventually became clear that her calling lay in the arts. After kicking off her modeling career at the age of 16, Monica Bellucci remained determined to pursue a career in law, and she even used her modeling money to pay for her post-secondary education. Yet there came a point at which Monica Bellucci was powerless to resist the allure of the fashion industry, and she devoted herself full-time to modeling.  In 1988, Monica Bellucci signed with the prestigious Elite Model Management agency and moved to Milan where she began establishing herself as one of the most naturally talented and flat-out gorgeous up-and-coming models on the scene. Though her burgeoning fame ensured that she had little downtime, Monica Bellucci nevertheless decided to give acting a try and she made her debut in a 1990 made-for-Italian-TV movie. She spent the next several years taking on small roles in obscure films, and Monica Bellucci found herself developing a real affinity for the world of performance. monica bellucci in bram stoker’s dracula Monica Bellucci’s hard work and perseverance paid off in 1992 when she successfully auditioned for a part in Bram Stoker’s Dracula, in which she starred opposite such luminaries as Winona Ryder, Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins as one of Dracula’s three brides. Monica Bellucci worked steadily throughout much of the 1990s, appearing in a whole host of critically acclaimed foreign movies (including ‘96’s L’Appartement, which was eventually remade as the Josh Hartnett/Diane Kruger flick Wicker Park). monica bellucci in malena Though Monica Bellucci had already established herself as a bona fide star in Europe, she remained virtually unknown in North America -- something that changed dramatically with the emergence of the new century. She kicked off 2000 with a star-making performance in the drama Malena, which went on to receive Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations. It was also around that time that Monica Bellucci married fellow actor and frequent costar Vincent Cassel, and in 2004, she gave birth to her daughter Deva. monica bellucci in the matrix reloaded After well-regarded turns in 2001’s Brotherhood of the Wolf and 2002’s Irreversible, Monica Bellucci reteamed with her Dracula costar Keanu Reeves with a stint as Persephone in 2003’s The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The following year proved to be even more fruitful for Monica Bellucci, as she appeared opposite Jim Caviezel in Mel Gibson’s extremely controversial The Passion of the Christ.  Monica Bellucci took on a role alongside Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti in the ultra-violent and purposefully ridiculous action flick Shoot ‘Em Up. monica bellucci is named no. 18 in 2009 top 99 Though Monica Bellucci is in her mid-40s, there’s little doubt that she remains one of the sexiest and alluring actresses working today. Her raw sensuality is unparalleled, and it’s certainly not difficult to see why she continues to outshine her younger and far more famous contemporaries.  In 2008, Monica Bellucci proved that she was still brimming with sex appeal as she ranked at No. 22 on AskMen.com's Top 99 list of Most Desirable Women and then moved up in the ranks in 2009, coming in at No. 18.  2010 is Bellucci’s most prominent year to date in English-language films, with The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, opposite Nicolas Cage and Jay Baruchel; The Whistleblower, opposite Rachel Weisz; and Joel Schumacher’s 1:30 Train. Did we mention that she’s 45?

From Chapter One – “I grew up in a world of violence and unpredictability. I learned to protect myself the best I could. I learned to take care of myself because no one else would. I learned to lie, to conceal, and to cover my fear with anger and violence.
No one knew the abuse that went on in our home, as we all learned to keep it hidden. No one knew my wish to make it stop. And later, no one knew the fear that overwhelmed me and drove me to hit and hurt the ones I loved most.”
This book exposes the thinking, beliefs and actions of a child who grows up to find himself being the abuser in his family. We follow his story from before childhood to the beginning of his journey to stop his violent and abusive behaviors.
Lee Cox offers powerful insights into his journey of healing himself. When he shares his story, his courage, candor and honesty inspire his audience to help stop domestic abuse. Lee speaks to: Students, Teachers, Law Enforcement, Domestic Violence Professionals, Civic organizations, Self Help groups and Community Leaders. Contact the EVE Foundation to have Lee speak at your next event.
