Christopher Francis Ocean (born Christopher Breaux; October 28, 1987), better known by his stage name Frank Ocean, is an American singer-songwriter and rapper. Ocean started his career as a ghostwriter for artists such as Brandy, Justin Bieber, and John Legend. In 2010, he became a member of alternative hip hop collective OFWGKTA also known as Odd Future, and his debut mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra, was released to critical acclaim in 2011. The singles "Novacane" and "Swim Good" both achieved chart success.
In 2012, Ocean finished second place in the BBC's Sound of 2012 poll.[9] His debut studio album, Channel Orange, was released in July 2012, promoted with three charting singles: "Thinkin Bout You", "Pyramids", and "Sweet Life".
Ocean was born Christopher Edwin "Lonny" Breaux on October 28, 1987, in Long Beach, California.[10] When he was around five years old, he and his family moved to New Orleans, Louisiana.[10] He grew up around its local jazz scene and listened to his mother's CDs on her car stereo, including albums by Celine Dion, Anita Baker, and The Phantom of the Opera soundtrack.[3] As a teenager, he did neighborhood chores and saved up money to rent studio time.[3] As he recalled, "Oh man I had numerous hustles [...] Washing cars was one of them, and mowing lawns and walking dogs."[3] He enrolled in the University of New Orleans and moved into its dormitory in 2005.[3] Shortly after enrolling in the university, Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and he transferred to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.[11]
In 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit Ocean's hometown of New Orleans and his recording facility was destroyed by floodwater and looting.[12] To continue recording music, he moved to Los Angeles and intended to stay for just six weeks[3] but decided to stay longer and develop his music career after establishing contact with people in the music industry.[12] He recorded some demos at a friend's studio and shopped them around Los Angeles.[3]
After getting a songwriting deal, he started working with other record producers and wrote songs for artists such as Justin Bieber, John Legend, Brandy,[3][12][13] and Beyoncé.[14][15] Ocean later said of his work at the time, "There was a point where I was composing for other people, and it might have been comfy to continue to do that and enjoy that income stream and the anonymity. But that's not why I moved away from school and away from family."[12] He has also worked with artists such as Nas[16][17] and Pharrell Williams.[18]
Ocean joined Los Angeles-based hip hop collective Odd Future, whom he had met in 2009.[13] His friendship with Odd Future member Tyler, The Creator reinvigorated Ocean's songwriting.[19] In late 2009, he met Tricky Stewart, who helped him sign a contract with Def Jam Recordings as a solo artist.[13][20][21]
On February 18, 2011, Ocean released his first mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra, to critical acclaim.[13][21] The mixtape focuses on interpersonal relationships, personal reflection and social commentary.[13] NPR's Andrew Noz said Ocean's songwriting is "smart and subtle...setting him apart from the pack."[22] Rolling Stone magazine's Jonah Weiner wrote that Ocean was a "gifted avant-R&B smoothie".[23] In April 2011, Ocean stated that his relationship with Def Jam strengthened since the release of the mixtape.[24] The mixtape made Ocean widely known and led to his collaborations with rappers Jay-Z and Kanye West.[25]
Ocean first appeared in Tyler, The Creator's music video for the single "She", from Tyler's second studio album Goblin (2011).[26][27] His first performance was in collaboration with Odd Future at the 2011 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, where he later joined them for their first tour across the east coast of the United States.[28] On May 19, 2011 Ocean's record label Def Jam announced its plans to re-release Nostalgia, Ultra as an EP.[29] The single 'Novacane' was released to iTunes in May 2011, and the EP originally was set to be released the next month, but was delayed.[30][31] In June 2011, Ocean revealed that he would be working on the upcoming Kanye West and Jay-Z collaborative album, Watch the Throne.[32] Ocean co-wrote and featured on two tracks: "No Church in the Wild" and "Made in America".[33][34]
Ocean sampled the music from The Eagles' song "Hotel California" on his song "American Wedding" from Nostalgia, Ultra. When asked about it, Ocean stated that Eagles band member "Don Henley is apparently intimidated by my rendition of 'Hotel California'. He threatened to sue if I perform it again." In response to Ocean's comments, The Eagles legal representative released a statement: "Frank Ocean did not merely 'sample' a portion of the Eagles' 'Hotel California,' he took the whole master track, plus the song's existing melody, and replaced the lyrics with his own. This is not creative, let alone 'intimidating.' It's illegal. For the record, Don Henley has not threatened or instituted any legal action against Frank Ocean, although the Eagles are now considering whether they should."[35][36] Chris Richards of The Washington Post remarked that "certain boomers don't like [Ocean] as much" as "information-age babies" due to the controversy.[37]
On July 28, 2011, a song titled "Thinkin Bout You", leaked on the internet.[38] It was later revealed the song was a reference track, written by Ocean, for Roc Nation artist Bridget Kelly's debut studio album.[39] Kelly renamed the song 'Thinking About Forever'.[40] In September 2011, a music video directed by High5Collective for Ocean's version was released, yet the song still appeared on Kelly's debut EP Every Girl.[41]
In August 2011, Frank Ocean made his first appearance on the cover of the publication The FADER, in its 75th issue.[42]
Ocean released the cover art for his debut studio album's lead single, titled "Thinkin Bout You", revealing the song would be released to digital retailers on April 10, 2012.[43] However, a month earlier, a re-mastered version of the song had already leaked.[44] About the prospective single he said: "It succinctly defines me as an artist for where I am right now and that was the aim," he said of the follow-up to his acclaimed Nostalgia, Ultra. "It's about the stories. If I write 14 stories that I love, then the next step is to get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story and all kinds of sonic goodness."[43]
Perhaps this is R&B's Ziggy Stardust moment, where the controversy and publicity surrounding an artist's sexuality and the brilliance of his latest album combine to give his career unstoppable momentum.
In 2012, Ocean released his debut studio album Channel Orange to universal acclaim from critics, who later named it the best album of the year in the HMV's Poll of Polls. It also earned Ocean six Grammy Award nominations and was credited by some writers for moving the R&B genre in a different, more challenging direction. Considered as Ocean's first commercial release on a traditional record label, Channel Orange featured unconventional songs that were noted for their storytelling and social commentary, and a dense musical fusion that drew on hip hop, soul, and R&B. The songs about unrequited love in particular received the most attention, partly because of Ocean's announcement prior to the album's release, when he revealed that his first love was a man. The announcement made global headlines, and some critics compared its cultural impact to when David Bowie revealed that he was gay in 1972.[25] Ocean promoted the album with his 2012 Summer Tour, which featured final appearances at the Coachella and Lollapalooza festivals.[46]
In February 2013, Ocean confirmed that he had started work on his second studio album, which he confirmed would be another concept album. He revealed that he was working with Tyler, the Creator, Pharrell Williams, and Danger Mouse on the record.[47] He later stated that he was being influenced by The Beach Boys and The Beatles. He stated he was interested in collaborating with Tame Impala and King Krule and that he would record part of the album in Bora Bora.[48][49] On May 28, 2013, Ocean announced the You're Not Dead... 2013 Tour; a fourteen-date European and Canadian tour that began on June 16, 2013, in Munich. He had been scheduled to perform at the first night of OVO Fest on August 4, 2013; however he was forced to cancel his appearance due to a small vocal chord injury. The first night of the music festival was subsequently cancelled and James Blake was booked to appear during the second night as Ocean's replacement.[50][51] Frank Ocean appears on John Mayer's album Paradise Valley, as a featured artist on a song called "Wildfire".[52]
On 10 March 2014, the song "Hero" was made available for free download on SoundCloud. The song is a collaboration with Mick Jones, Paul Simonon and Diplo and is a part of Converse's Three Artists. One Song series.[53] In April 2014, Ocean stated that his second album was nearly finished.[54][dead link]
The 2012 song mixes spiritual and sexual subject matter and features colorful guitar, fluctuating synthesizers, and a loping rhythm section.[55]
Ocean's music has been characterized by music writers as idiosyncratic in style.[56][57][58] Ocean generally plays the electronic keyboard,[56] and is backed by a subdued rhythm section in the production.[59] His compositions are often midtempo, feature unconventional melodies,[56][59] and they occasionally have an experimental song structure.[58][59] In his songwriting, Jon Pareles of The New York Times observes "open echoes of self-guided, innovative R&B songwriters like Prince, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Maxwell, Erykah Badu and particularly R. Kelly and his way of writing melodies that hover between speech and song, asymmetrical and syncopated."[59] While nostalgia, ULTRA featured both original music by Ocean and tracks relying on sampled melodies,[60] channel ORANGE showcased Ocean as the primary musical composer, of which music journalist Robert Christgau opines, "when he's the sole composer Ocean resists making a show of himself—resists the dope hook, the smart tempo, the transcendent falsetto itself."[61]
Ocean's lyrics deal with themes of love, longing, misgiving,[59] and nostalgia.[62] His debut single "Novacane" juxtaposes the numbness and artificiality of a sexual relationship with that of mainstream radio,[59] while "Voodoo" merges themes of spirituality and sexuality,[63] and is an eccentric take on such subject matter common in R&B.[55] The latter song was released by Ocean on his Tumblr account and references both the traditional spiritual "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands" and the female anatomy in its chorus: "she's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit / he's got the whole wide world in his pants / he wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band / then put the whole wide world on her hands / she's got the whole wide world in her hands / he's got the whole wide world in his hands."[55][64] Certain songs on channel ORANGE allude to Ocean's experience with unrequited love.[56] Culture critic Nelson George asserts that, along with Miguel, Ocean has "staked out ground where [he is] not competing with those hit-driven [commercial R&B] acts" and is "cultivating a sound that balances adult concerns with a sense of young men trying to understand their own desires (an apt description of Ocean, particularly)."[65]
Ocean describes himself as "a baritone, with tenor moments."[66] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone calls him a torch singer due to "his feel for romantic tragedy, unfurling in slow-boiling ballads".[67] Ocean's stage presence during live shows is often low-key.[68][69][70]
In 2010, he changed his name from Christopher Breaux to Christopher Francis Ocean through a legal website.[13] The change was reportedly partly inspired by the 1960 film Ocean's 11.[19]
Ocean became one of the first major African-American music artists to announce that he had once fallen in love with someone of the same sex, notable because that music scene is known for homophobia.[71][72]
Ocean wrote an open letter, initially intended for the liner notes on Channel Orange, that would preemptively address speculation about his same-sex attraction.[73] Instead, on July 4, 2012, he published an open letter on his Tumblr blog[74][75] recounting unrequited feelings he had for another young man when he was 19 years old, citing it as his first true love.[74] He used the blog to thank the man for his influence, and also thanked his mother and other friends, saying "I don't know what happens now, and that's alrite. I don't have any secrets I need kept anymore...I feel like a free man."[76]
Members of the hip hop industry generally responded positively to the announcement.[77] Russell Simmons, a business magnate in the hip hop industry, wrote a congratulatory article in Global Grind saying "Today is a big day for hip-hop. It is a day that will define who we really are. How compassionate will we be? How loving can we be? How inclusive are we? [...] Your decision to go public about your sexual orientation gives hope and light to so many young people still living in fear."[78] Other artists who expressed their support included Beyoncé and Jay-Z.[79] Tyler, The Creator also tweeted his support for Ocean, along with other members of OFWGKTA.[80]
On December 31, 2012, Ocean was pulled over in Mono County, California for speeding. In a search police officers found a few grams of marijuana. He was cited for possession, driving on a suspended license and having tinted windows.[81]
In January 2013, Ocean got into an altercation with Chris Brown over a parking space, outside a recording studio in West Hollywood. Police officers in Los Angeles said that Chris Brown was under investigation, describing the incident as "battery" due to Brown punching Ocean.[83] Ocean said he would not press charges despite the fact that Brown had threatened to shoot him, and one of Brown's entourage had called him a homophobic slur.[84] Ocean would then criticize Chris Brown in the song "Sunday", from Earl Sweatshirt's album Doris.[85]
Ocean and his music have received international recognition with many award nominations and wins. As of February 2013, he won two Grammys, a Soul Train and UK Music Award. In addition, he earned accolades from GQ, NME, and Vibe magazines, as well as the BBC and mtvU.

      Four summers ago, I met somebody. I was nineteen years old. He was too. We spent that summer, and the summer after, together. Everyday almost. And on the days we were together, time would glide. Most of the day I'd see him and his smile, I'd hear his conversation and his silence until it was time to sleep. Sleep I would often share with him. By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless. I sat there and told my friend how I felt. I wept as the words left my mouth. I grieved for them, knowing I could never take them back for myself. He patted my back. He said kind things. He did his best, but he wouldn't admit the same. He had to go back inside soon. It was late and his girlfriend was waiting for him upstairs. He wouldn't tell me the truth about his feelings for me for another three years. I felt like I'd only imagined reciprocity for years. Now imagine being thrown from a cliff. No, I wasn't on a cliff, I was still in my car telling myself it was gonna be fine and to take deep breaths. I took the breaths and carried on. I kept up a peculiar friendship with him because I couldn't imagine keeping up my life without him. I struggled to master myself and my emotions. I wasn't always successful. Before writing this I'd told some people my story. I'm sure these people kept me alive, kept me save sincerely, these are the folks I wanna thank from the floor of my heart. Everyone of you knows who you are great humans, probably angels. I don't know what happens now, and that's alright. I don't have any secrets I need kept anymore. There's probably some small shit still, but you know what I mean. I was never alone, as much as I felt like it as much as I still do sometimes. I never was. I don't think I ever could be. Thanks. To my first love. I'm grateful for you. Grateful that even though it wasn't what I hoped for and even though it was never enough, it was. Some things never are and we were. I won't forget you. I won't forget the summer. I'll remember who I was when I met you. Thanks. To my mother, you raised me strong. I know I'm only braved because you were first ... so thank you. All of you. For everything good. I feel like a free man. If I listen closely I can hear the sky falling too.
      I'll usually cringe at the R&B label. Because it's like calling it urban and what the fuck is urban music?
      My generation just doesn't have the best taste in leadership. And weak leadership means little to no cohesion. If there's no cohesion, there's no real chance for effective protest or politics. Obviously, looking at Occupy Wall Street, there are a few in our bunch who still give a damn enough to rally and shout. This will change once I'm elected President.
      [about his sexuality and coming out before the release of his album][It was] about my own sanity and my ability to feel like I'm living a life where. I'm happy when I wake up in the morning, and not with this freaking' boulder on my chest. I knew that I was writing [the album] in a way that people would ask questions. I knew that my star was rising, and I knew that if I waited I would always have somebody that I respected be able to encourage me to wait longer, to not say it till who knows when. I wished at 13 there was somebody I looked up to who would have said something like that, who would have been transparent in that way.
      [on being fearless about his sexual declaration] People are just afraid of things too much. Afraid of things that don't necessarily merit fear. Me putting Nostalgia out. What's physically going to happen? Me saying what I said on my Tumblr last week? Sure, evil exists, extremism exists. Somebody could commit a hate crime and hurt me. But they could do the same just because I'm black. They could do the same just because I'm American. Do you just not go outside your house? Do you not drive your car because of the statistics? How else are you limiting your life for fear?
      The core message of my music is to encourage people to think differently about their relationships. Not just romantic relationships, but as people, period.
      [on changing his name] I changed my name on my birthday last year. It was the most empowering shit I did in 2010, for sure. I went on LegalZoom and changed my name. It just felt cool. None of us are our names. If you don't like your name then change your name. I'm only a few steps into the process, so I probably shouldn't even be talking about this, but by the beginning of summer I'll be straight. I'll be boarding planes as Christopher Francis Ocean.
      [on Hurricane Katrina, which devastated his city and his recording facilities] The storm itself didn't make me move, but the storm ruined my recording environment and the studio I was working in got looted and destroyed by floodwater. I didn't have a place to work in New Orleans so I left and came to LA.
      There was a point where I was composing for other people, and it might have been comfy to continue to do that and enjoy that income stream and the anonymity. But that's not why I moved away from school and away from family.
      It's about the stories. If I write 14 stories that I love, then the next step is to get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story and all kinds of sonic goodness.
      [on why he doesn't do much press] It seems healthier to be a little more reclusive. I rely heavily on my art form and letting that speak for me and what I do.
      I think my creativity comes from a really pure place. I feel at a higher level of consciousness when I'm being creative.
      [on his relationship with Odd Future] That's family. I've known them from before all the attention. I met them at the end of 2009. I don't keep a journal or anything like that, so I don't remember dates and times that I met folks, but it's all through creativity. That's how we clicked. It's like how you meet anyone else. I guess social networking is a part of how people meet these days, but that's not how this happened. It was more like a person-to-person, mutual friends, sort of thing.
      My music definitely comes from a place of experience. Everything connects to a truth. Heartbreak, I imagine, has been the same emotion since the beginning of it all. I think the reason it might sound different coming from me is because, as a storyteller I might be telling the story differently than how it's been told. But I don't think I'm telling a new story. Maybe I'm wrong.
      I'm an artist, first and foremost. I don't like boxes. Whether you're singing or rapping or spoken word, any combination you love, the lyrics sheet should always read well. So that's how I approach everything, no matter what I'm doing.
      [on Don Henley threatening to sue him over his "Hotel California" sample on the track "American Wedding" from Nostalgia, Ultra] He [They] threatened to sue if I perform it again. I think that's fucking awesome. I guess if I play it at Coachella it'll cost me a couple hundred racks. If I don't show up to court, it'll be a judgment against me and will probably show up on my credit report. Oh well. I try to buy my shit cash anyway. They asked that I release a statement expressing my admiration for Mr. Henley, along with my assistance pulling it off the web as much as possible. Shit's weird. Ain't this guy rich as fuck? Why sue the new guy? I didn't make a dime off that song. I released it for free. If anything I'm paying homage.
      [on whether he should have changed the pronouns of his songs to make them generic] Yes, I could have easily changed the words. But for what? I just feel like it's just another time now. When you write a song like "Forrest Gump", the subject can't be androgynous. It requires an unnecessary amount of effort. I don't fear anybody at all.
      [on his mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra] It's nostalgic. It's a longing for the past. That's what this record felt like. I named it five minutes before we finished mastering. Right before we had to write the labels on the CDs and get out of there. Ultra, because it's also modern because of the sonics of it. It felt right. That's how I am. I just go with it. The only big debate was whether I was going to use the slash or the comma, but the comma felt right, too.
      [on the making of his mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra] It was like difficult to make. Not like writing the songs  arranging the songs. That had a level of difficulty, too. But just piecing together all the levels to do it at the level, the quality of records I wanted to make. But, it was a process I appreciate so much.
      [his statement when he had to cancel his European tour dates, including opening slot for Coldplay] Let me start by staying I feel like an asshole right now, but a tough decision had to be made in regard to my schedule over the next months and the casualties of that decision include my appearances at upcoming festivals in Europe and my opening slot on the European leg of the Coldplay world tour. I'll be back if you'll have me.
      [on how he remains a pop star mystery] It's not formulaic. It's not me necessarily trying to preserve mystique. It's who I am. It's how I prefer to move. I really don't think that deeply about it at all, I swear I don't. I'm just existing.
      With my art, it's the one thing that I know will outlive me and outlive my feelings. It will outlive my depressive seasons.
      I'm extremely compassionate, loving, all of those warm fuzzy things, but the outer shell doesn't project that all the time.
      I want to give the best show possible when I can and put myself in a position to just do my best. So if that means a lesser volume of appearances then so be it. I'm in this thing, whatever it is, I hate to call it a game because I take it pretty seriously but I'm in it for as long as I'm allowed to be. It's not about "let's do a million things right now". It's about "let's just do our best to do the best things right now".
      The work is the work. The work is not me. I like the anonymity that directors can have about their films. Even though it's my voice, I'm a storyteller.
      [on why he doesn't put his name on his album covers] As a lifestyle you always being the focal point is innately unhealthy.
      I knew that I was writing in a way that people would ask questions. I knew that my star was rising, and I knew that if I waited I would always have somebody that I respected be able to encourage me to wait longer, to not say it till who knows when. It was important for me to know that when I go out on the road and I do these things, that I'm looking at people who are applauding because of an appreciation for me. I don't have many secrets, so if you know that, and you're still applauding it may be some sort of sick validation but it was important to me. When I heard people talking about certain, you know, 'pronouns' in the writing of the record, I just wanted to - like I said on the post [his Tumblr post where he addressed his sexuality] offer some clarity; clarify, before the fire got too wild and the conversation became too unfocused and murky.
      I've always wanted to make a career in the arts, and I think that my only hope at doing that is to make it more about the work. I enjoy singing my songs in front of people. I enjoy being involved in making the artwork for albums and stupid stuff like that. I wouldn't be a part of [it] if I was just writing songs for others.
      [on his song "Pyramids"] I have actual pimps in my family in LA. It was fantasy built off that dynamic, but you can only write what you know to a point.
      For a song like "Crack Rock", my grandfather, who had struggled to be a father for my mom and my uncle. His second chance at fatherhood was me. In his early-20s, he had a host of problems with addiction and substance abuse. When I knew him, he was a mentor for the NA and the AA groups. I used to go to the meetings and hear these stories from the addicts - heroin and crack and alcohol. So stories like that influence a song like that.
      LA is something special to me. LA is special because I wrote Channel Orange here, I wrote Nostalgia, Ultra here, I fell in love here, I got my heart broken here, I got a little famous here, I got a paid here.
      Odd Future is comprised of gifted and talented American kids. We challenge each other. They challenge me for sure. Whenever you're in a circle that's talented throughout, it makes less room for complacency. My purpose is to contribute to that productive environment as much as I can.
      [on what inspires his songs] guess I'm just inspired to tell stories and I enjoy music and just the art form so much, that it seems like the perfect medium to tell stories. And in my life, times that I've enjoy and that mean a lot to me, I often go back to them. So when I'm making music, that's really all you can draw off of when your storytelling is your own experiences and memories and personal wisdom and knowledge. When I pull from that place it comes along with pictures. And when I'm trying to make song, even the parts that don't have words it's still me really trying to make a photograph out of something you could never see.
      [on the digital version of his album Channel Orange more than one week before it came out in stores] I kinda wanted to mirror what Jay-Z and Kanye West did with Watch the Throne. Preventing the leak by staggering the digital and physical dates. My thing was, I wanted all the promotional elements to be- I don't know if the word is 'retroactive,' but kind of follow the album with the videos and the tour and do everything after. And kind of just let the music speak for itself for a second and not be in a situation where the record leaked. It was always my plan to drop it ahead of physical.
      [on Channel Orange] I wanted to do things that I hadn't done before structurally with songs and I wanted to go different places sonically that I hadn't gone before. I tried to make something that was true to what I heard in my head, true to what I thought the future should be for me music-wise.
      I'm not about to go and do every feature that comes forward. I think people in the urban music scene place too much of a premium on collaborations to begin with. That's the first thing. And second, I think that people shouldn't be on magazines that they wouldn't read and shouldn't really feature on songs that they wouldn't listen to if they weren't on it.
      It's not about as soon as I got offers for five, ten, fifteen thousand to go do shows. It's about getting a show ready and really doin' a show right, and doing your best to just give your best.
      The writing, for me, is the easiest part-I was looking for another word besides easy-but that's the part that's the most natural to me. I never felt like I had a crazy, natural talent for singing.
      That's something so sincere and endearing about writing. I enjoy writing like that sometimes. I enjoy photography in a record. Creative writing coupled with what music is, just within itself, the instrumentation, the melody without any words, just humming, the emotions, the notes by themselves and together can emote, coupled with my knack for writing, there's a power in that.
      I'm really trying to create this environment around the song that makes the listener feel like they're in this place and they're hearing the story and not only are they hearing it, they're really seeing it.
      I just think R&B is so racial. I'm going to borrow a line from Duke Ellington and say it's "beyond category." Pharrell Williams has told me to say I'm a singer/songwriter, because that's what I really am. I don't want to step off into the "Don't label me because I'm black" realm, but I would say any artist that is killing it right now has long since abandoned genre and expanded past certain labels.
      If someone breaks your heart just punch them in the face. Seriously. Punch them in the face and go get some ice cream.
      [on being a fan of Stanley Kubrick and Steven Soderbergh] If I can do in music what they did in movies, tell those kinds of stories? That's what I want to do.
      I wanna write a novel about twins, some type of nature versus nurture tale. I've said that to a neighbor before. It's an open ended idea. I want to start a car club. I'm playing with two names for it. I sketched a logo for it. It's not there yet. I was going to build an arcade, the more I lived with that idea the less it stuck.
      I sat in the studio days ago with Jay-Z and Pharrell Williams. Pharrell looks 19. They seemed like old friends. I wonder how many trophies are logged in their mind. I wonder why they still build. I build things for the sport and the therapeutic benefits.
      All I really have to say is that love is all there is. Every other sentence just belabors the point. Maybe not in a boring way, I don't know what I'm saying.
      [on the personal importance of meeting Odd Future] I was at a real dark time in my life when I met them. I was looking for just a reprieve. At 20 or 21, I had, I think, a couple hundred thousand dollars [from producing and songwriting], a nice car, a Beverly Hills apartment-and I was miserable. Because of the relationship in part and the heartbreak in part, and also just miserable because of like just carting that around. And here was this group of like-minded individuals whose irreverence made me revere. The do-it-yourself mentality of OF really rubbed off on me.
      [on challenging himself] John Mayer and I were talking in rehearsal before Saturday Night Live (1975), and he was like, "You love to take the hardest way. You don't always have to." We all know we have a finite period of time. I just feel if I'm going to be alive, I want to be challenged-to be as immortal as possible. The path to that isn't an easy way, but it's a rewarding way.
      [when asked if he was bisexual in the December 2012 edition of GQ] You can move to the next question. I'll respectfully say that life is dynamic and comes along with dynamic experiences, and the same sentiment that I have towards genres of music, I have towards a lot of labels and boxes and shit. I'm in this business to be creative-I'll even diminish it and say to be a content provider. One of the pieces of content that I'm for fuck sure not giving is porn videos. I'm not a centerfold. I'm not trying to sell you sex. People should pay attention to that in the letter: I didn't need to label it for it to have impact. Because people realize everything that I say is so relatable, because when you're talking about romantic love, both sides in all scenarios feel the same shit. As a writer, as a creator, I'm giving you my experiences. But just take what I give you. You ain't got to pry beyond that. I'm giving you what I feel like you can feel. The other shit, you can't feel. You can't feel a box. You can't feel a label. Don't get caught up in that shit. There's so much something in life. Don't get caught up in the nothing. That shit is nothing, you know? It's nothing. Vanish the fear.
      [on coming out and worries about if it would hurt his career] I had those fears. In black music, we've got so many leaps and bounds to make with acceptance and tolerance in regard to that issue. It reflects something just ingrained, you know. When I was growing up, there was nobody in my family-not even my mother-who I could look to and be like, "I know you've never said anything homophobic." So, you know, you worry about people in the business who you've heard talk that way. Some people said, "He's saying he fell in love with a guy for hype." As if that's the best hype you can get in hip-hop or black music. So I knew that if I was going to say what I said, it had to be in concert with one of the most brilliant pieces of art that has come out in my generation. And that's what I did. Why can I say that? Why I don't have to affect all this humility and shit is because I worked my ass off. I worked my face off. And the part that you love the most is the easiest part for me. So I'll do it again.
      [his feelings after he came out] The night I posted it, I cried like a fucking baby. It was like all the frequency just clicked to a change in my head. All the receptors were now receiving a different signal, and I was happy. I hadn't been happy in so long. I've been sad again since, but it's a totally different take on sad. There's just some magic in truth and honesty and openness. Whatever I said in that letter, before I posted it, seemed so huge. But when you come out the other side, now your brain-instead of receiving fear-sees "Oh, shit happened and nothing happened." Brain says, "Self, I'm fine." I look around, and I'm touching my fucking limbs, and I'm good. Before anybody called me and said congratulations or anything nice, it had already changed. It wasn't from outside. It was completely in here, in my head.
      Of course awards matter. It's like a player in any ball league - NFL, NBA, whatever - you come up in these systems of organization, and you can hate the league but, at the end of the day, you can't hate the championship. Music industry people - and, whether I like it or not, I'm a music industry person - that's the game I came up in. The Grammys are like the championship, and that's cool. It's cool to be recognized by your peers.
      In art, at a certain level, there is no "better than". It's just about trying to operate for yourself on the most supreme level, artistically, that you can and hoping that people get it. Trusting that, just because of the way people are built and how interconnected we are, greatness will translate and symmetry will be recognized.
      I listen to my music too. I can't usually stomach a project after I finish it, but for those days and weeks and months that it's new to me, I do listen to it and it might change over time, but it's about function. If I'm maybe saying something I want to say, or capture a feeling in a story, or illustrate a character that I have on my mind, anything - function first, thrill second.
      Here's what I think about music and journalism: The most important thing is to just press play. All in all, I just don't trust journalists - and I don't think it's a good practice for me to trust journalists.
      I have no delusions about my likability, in every scenario. I know that in order to get things done the way you want them, oftentimes your position will be unpopular.
      That's why image is so important. That's why you've got to practice brevity when you do interviews like this. I could try to make myself likable to you so you could write a piece that keeps my image in good standing, because I'm still selling this, or I could just say, "My art speaks for itself."
      Whenever I think about movies, I always look at that art process as having the best of a lot of worlds. Because if you watch a great film, you have a musical element to it, not just on the scoring, but in the way that the shots are edited - that has music and rhythm and time. Obviously the cinematography of films is art, just as a still shot can be art. If I'm watching a Wes Anderson movie, the color palettes alone, and the way they're painted, could be art. With music you're a little bit limited, of course, because it's only audio. Apart from the artwork and the music videos, if you can get the label to give you money for shit like that, or if you can do it yourself. But the storytelling, that's where you can really paint pictures. You can't do it with a melody or a sound or a rhythm or a chord progression. The storytelling part of it is the most interesting and challenging part of the whole process for me. Some people focus more on sonics. Some people focus more on story. I focus on both sonics and story, but music sometimes, just music itself, can turn into more of a maths problem. I guess everything in life is a math problem, but it can be more about an empirical route to getting the symmetry that you want, and this vibe, sonically. But storytelling's a different thing.
      I hope not to define myself by suffering. I don't worry about where [the inspiration] will come from. I think even with that cured, there's still so much to pull from. I know people like to say that. You know, "It's a gift and a curse." It's not a gift. I don't believe that. I believe it's just pain. The gift would be the gift whether I went through it or not. We'd just be having a different conversation.
      [on being on Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World list] This is pretty cool. The whole list is pretty rad, a pretty good assortment of folks. A very varied assortment of human beings in all different spaces and cool, very cool.
      My childhood was cool. New Orleans was good to me; the city's got a lot of character. My family is cool. I was kind of a 'bad kid' as far as school and stuff goes, you know - I wasn't the greatest student - but I had a cool childhood.
      You can't just go and buy new pants. And then, when you discover the pants, it's this euphoric feeling all throughout your body, because you know you found the right pants.
      Do I feel like I belong in LA? Here's my feeling about LA: LA is this massive place, and you get so many types of lifestyles and shit here; you find all these pockets. Take my friend who lives in Malibu, for example - I think that's still LA county. So, he lives in LA, but he lives in a place that doesn't look like it's LA. For all intents and purposes he isn't in the same LA that I live in at my place in Hollywood - we might as well be a state apart considering how different it is. So I can see myself belonging in certain parts of LA.
      [on Nabil Elderkin] Like, when I say that about Nabil, I feel like Nabil doesn't belong anywhere in LA County. Nabil belongs in Saint Petersburg, Russia, for a little while, or he belongs in a war zone taking iconic photos - risking his life for the shot. I think I could use a couple years away from this city - I think I could definitely use a couple years away from this city. Seven years is a long time.
      If I didn't live in LA I would have a much more refined daily dress-code. But since I live here, the weather's great, but it's also forbidding in the sense that I can't wear a ton of layers all the time and be really slick. Be really posh and shit - wear stuff of that nature. I was looking at a place in Notting Hill. I'm kind of obsessed with the idea of moving. I'm kind of obsessed with that. I'm gonna make the move.
      I went to Tokyo, and apart from it being really hot and humid, it was one of my favorite trips. I wasn't going there for a show or anything. I was just going to hang out. I'd been there for a couple weeks, and there's just something about the pride that they take in their work. That, I kind of gravitate towards. I mean, not to make my response too simple, but that's probably at the core of why I like so much of what comes out of that part of the world. They have that attitude towards their work pride and presentation. You have to be 'work first' for the whole benefit of the system that you're a part of. People need to direct their energy towards making something great and useful, you know? It should common sense, but, it's not!
      I didn't ever have a disciplinarian in my creative life. As a young person I didn't have - for lack of a better word - I didn't have a Joe Jackson in my family. I didn't have that sort of overbearing stage-parent. Or, even, I didn't even have a parent who encouraged what I did in that way. And - don't bring out the string section. It's not really sad - what it did foster is, well, my attitude was pure. I love to make music, and I love to write. It was writing first. I love to write and express myself in that medium, so that was the pure part - just the love of doing something, but there was also this fantasy of what the lifestyle would be and what the trappings of success would be. There are different little montage clips that you make up in your mind, like what a day in the life would be like once you're a fully grown whatever-you're-going-to-become. Writing is most certainly an art form - and you have to keep balancing, juggling like circus actors, negotiating between the business and the craft. I'd almost lean toward saying that's an art form in and of itself also.
      [when asked about the worst thing he has been called] The worst thing I've been called. I mean, it's less about what someone calls you, and more about who's calling you that. So, I don't know the answer to that question. I'm a bit impervious to the things that people say, depending on who's saying it. I try to unflip things and have thick skin no matter what people are saying, but when people are closer to you. You know, you get into a spat with someone you care about, and they say some shit they don't mean, or that they do mean, which makes it more emotional, but, you know - you get over it.

Distinctive R&B artist who affiliated with Odd Future and wrote for Justin Bieber and Brandy prior to releasing a Grammy-winning Def Jam debut.
=======================================================
An R&B vocalist affiliated with the outlandish hip-hop crew Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All, Frank Ocean (Christopher "Lonny" Breaux) was born and raised in New Orleans. The aspiring songwriter and singer had just moved into his dorm at the University of New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina hit. With his future under water, Ocean immediately left the academic life behind and moved to L.A. to give music a shot. He cut some demos at a friend's home studio, shopped them around town, and eventually landed a songwriting deal that would find him working for Justin Bieber, John Legend, and Brandy. Some of this work was alongside Christopher "Tricky" Stewart, a fellow songwriter and producer who would convince Ocean to sign a solo artist deal with Def Jam in late 2009. It was also around this time he met Odd Future and began writing music for the crew while making guest appearances on their mixtapes. 
In February 2011, as Odd Future were making waves, Ocean broke out on his own with the Nostalgia, Ultra mixtape, issued through his Tumblr blog. Later in the year, he appeared on Tyler, the Creator's Goblin ("She," "Window"), Beyoncé's 4 ("I Miss You"), and Jay-Z and Kanye West's Watch the Throne ("No Church in the Wild," "Made in America"). Def Jam's plan for the release of Nostalgia, Lite -- an EP-length version of the mixtape -- was scrapped, yet the songs "Novacane" (produced by Stewart) and "Swim Good" (MIDI Mafia) were released as singles with accompanying videos. The former reached number 17 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart. The latter peaked at number 70. By the end of the year, several publications listed Nostalgia, Ultra as one of 2011's best releases. 
While his association with Def Jam had been strained, Ocean nonetheless proceeded with the making of his official debut album, working beside the likes of Malay, Om'Mas Keith, and Pharrell Williams as fellow producers. The album, Channel Orange, was previewed for journalists at a handful of listening events. Some writers alleged that certain lyrics on the album revealed Ocean's bisexuality. Ocean subsequently published a screen shot of a TextEdit file (entitled "thank you's") that included details of a romantic relationship -- his first love -- with a male. On July 10, six days after the post, Channel Orange was released by Def Jam as a download, while the CD version was issued the following week. Along with featured appearances from Earl Sweatshirt, John Mayer, and André 3000, the album involved material about unrequited love, as well as class and drug dependency -- all delivered with Ocean's descriptive storytelling and understated yet expressive vocals. Within hours of its iTunes release, Channel Orange was number one on the download store's Top Albums chart. the album would go on to be an all-around success, receiving nearly universal critical acclaim, a spot on the Billboard 200, and a host of Grammy nominations. ~ David Jeffries & Andy Kellman, Rovi

	Rising R&B star Frank Ocean has been making waves with his inventive and refreshingly honest lyrics, and undeniably catch new sound. His latest album channel Orange has been given rave reviews by music blogs and critics everywhere, and the 24-year-old New Orleans-native is steadily climbing the charts and set to become R&B’s hottest new face. Find out more about him in his Kidzworld Bio!
Christopher “Lonny” Breaux (who we know as Frank Ocean) was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana and was heavily influenced by the local jazz scene. To fuel his interest in music he listened to artists like Anita Baker and as a teenager he would perform odd jobs like mowing lawns, washing cars and walking dogs in order to rent studio time. He also attended the University of New Orleans. In 2005 tragedy struck, Hurricane Katrina wrought havoc in his hometown and Frank’s recording studio was destroyed by flood water and looters. He decided it was time to pack up his things and try his luck in Los Angeles.
	Frank had only planned to stay in L.A. for six weeks, but once he became acquainted with the music industry there he extended his stay and quickly landed a songwriting deal. He’s written songs for big stars like Justin Bieber, John Legend, Brandy and Beyonce. But Frank wasn’t content to simply write for other people and when he met Odd Future, an L.A.-based hip hop collective, he knew he had found likeminded individuals who would push him in the right direction.
	Especially up-and-coming rapper Tyler the Creator, who has also received critical praise and built and underground fan base with his boundary-pushing lyrics and sound. Tyler spurred Frank on to write even better songs and Frank was then signed to Def Jam Records. In 2010 he legally changed his name to Christopher Frank Williams Ocean, partly inspired by the original ‘60s film Ocean’s 11, and decided to release tracks under the name Frank Ocean.
	 "There was a point where I was composing for other people, and it might have been comfy to continue to do that and enjoy that income stream and the anonymity. But that's not why I moved away from school and away from family." 
	In 2011 Frank released his mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra to immediate critical acclaim and began to build a dedicated fan base. His first live performance was with Odd Future at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Def Jam now plans to re-release Nostalgia, Ultra as an EP. Creating buzz in the industry Frank was invited to collaborate with Kanye West and Jay Z on their album Watch the Throne.
	Frank Ocean’s album channel ORANGE was released one week early on July 10th 2012 and is now available for download on iTunes, you can also preview it on his Tumblr page. He recently performed the track “Bad Religion” from the new album on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.

Frank Ocean was born Christopher Lonny Breaux on October 28, 1987, in New Orleans, Louisiana. After Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, Ocean and his family evacuated to Los Angeles with the intention of staying no more than two months.Once the family settled, Ocean quickly made ties in the music industry and decided to reside in Long Beach to pursue his musical career.In 2009, Ocean joined Los Angeles based collective OFWGKTA (Odd Future) and met Tricky Stewart, who eventually helped Ocean sign record deal with Def Jam Recordings. Although it was a great accomplishment, Ocean's relationship with the label started off rocky, due to his growing concern of Def Jam not furthering his career.Inspired by the crime comedy Ocean's Eleven (1960), Ocean legally changed his name from Christopher Breaux to Christopher Francis Ocean in 2010. He then began writing songs for the popular artists John Legend, Justin Bieber, Beyoncé Knowles, Nas and Pharrell.Ocean finally received the critically acclaimed praise he was searching for with the release of his first mix-tape Nostalgia, Utlra in 2011. Jonah Weiner of Rolling Stone magazine referred to Ocean as a "gifted avant-R&B smoothie" while Andrew Noz of NPR noted his songwriting a "smart and subtle... setting him apart from the pack." Due to the highly received mix-tape, Ocean admitted that his relationship Def Jam had grown stronger. After the mixtape's release, his single "Novacane" reached No. 17 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart while "Swim Good" reached No. 70.2011 continued to be a strong year for Ocean, making his first debut performance with Odd Future at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Def Jam's announcement to re-release Nostalgia, Ultra as a full-length album. In June of that same year, Ocean worked with Kanye West and Jay-Z on the album Watch the Throne, co-writing and performing the tracks "No Church in the Wild" and "Made in America." On July 17, 2012, Ocean released his 'real' debut album Channel Orange and gave an acoustic performance of his Channel Orange hit single "Thinkin' Bout You" at the MTV Video Music Awards in September. The album went on to earn him several Grammy nominations in 2013, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year for "Thinkin' 'Bout You," and win the Grammy for Best Urban Contemporary Album.Is Frank Ocean Gay?Rumors that Frank Ocean was gay developed when fans and critics started to notice that Ocean referenced a "him" rather than "her" in many of his deep-felt songs. Ocean then posted a letter on Tumblr to justify his actions:BasedGod was right... we're all a bunch of golden million dollar babies. My hope is that the babies born these days will inherit less of the bullshit than we did. Anyhow, what i'm about to post is for anyone who cares to read. it was intended to fill the thank you's section in my album credits, but with all the rumors going round.. i figured it'd be good to clarify. Whoever you are. Wherever you are… I'm starting to think we're a lot alike. Human beings spinning on blackness. All wanting to be seen, touched, heard, paid attention to. My loved ones are everything to me here. In the last year or 3 I've screamed at my creator, screamed at clouds in the sky, for some explanation. Mercy maybe. For peace of mind to rain like manna somehow. 4 summers ago, I met somebody. I was 19 years old. He was too. We spent that summer, and the summer after, together. Everyday almost. And on the days we were together, time would glide. Most of the day I'd see him, and his smile. I'd hear his conversation and his silence…until it was time to sleep. Sleep I would often share with him. By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless. There was no escaping, no negotiating with the feeling. No choice. It was my first love. It would change my life. Back then my mind would wander to the women I had been with, the ones I cared for and thought I was in love with. I reminisced about the sentimental songs I enjoyed when I was a teenager. The ones I played when I experienced a girlfriend too quickly. Imagine being thrown from a plane. I wasn't in a plane though. I was in a Nissan Maxima, the same car I packed up with bags and drove to Los Angeles in. I sat there and told my friend how I felt. I wept as the words left my mouth. I grieved for then. Knowing I could never take them back for myself. He patted my back. He said kind things. He did his best, but he wouldn't admit the same. He had to go back inside soon. It was late and his girlfriend was waiting for him upstairs. He wouldn't tell the truth about his feelings for me for another 3 years. I felt like I'd only imagined reciprocity for years. Now imagine being thrown from a cliff. No, I wasn't on a cliff. I was still in my car telling myself it was gonna be find and to take deep breaths. I took the breaths and carried on. I kept up a peculiar friendship with him because I couldn't imagine keeping up my life without him. I struggled to master myself and my emotions. I wasn't always successful.The dance went on. I kept the rhythm for several summers after. It's winter now. I'm typing this on a plane back to Los Angeles from New Orleans. I flew home for another marred Christmas. I have a windowseat. It's December 27, 2011. By now I've written two albums. This being the second. I wrote to keep myself busy and sane. I wanted to create worlds that were rosier than mine. I tried to channel overwhelming emotions. I'm surprise at how far all of it has taken me. Before writing this I'd told some people my story. I'm sure these people kept me alive, kept me safe. Sincerely, these are the folks I wanna thank from the floor of my heart. Everyone of you knows who you are. Great humans, probably angels. I don't know what happens now. And that's alrite. I don't have any secrets I need kept anymore. There's probably some small shit still, but you know what I mean. I was never alone, as much as it felt like it. As much as I still do sometimes. I never was. I don't think I ever could be. Thanks. To my first love, I'm grateful for you. Grateful that even thought it wasn't what I hoped for and even thought it was never enough, it was. Some things never are. And we were. I won't forget you. I won't forget the summer. I'll remember who I was when I met you. I'll remember who you were and how we've both changed and stayed the same. I've never had more respect for life and living than I have right now. Maybe it takes a near death experience to feel alive. Thanks. To my mother. You raised me strong. I know I'm only brave because you were first. So thank you. All of you. For everything good. I feel like a free man. If I listen closely, I can hear the sky falling too.- Frank
