Sir Jonathan Paul "Jony" Ive, KBE RDI (born 27 February 1967)[1] is an English designer and the Senior Vice President of Design at Apple Inc. He oversees the Industrial Design Group, and also provides leadership and direction for Human Interface (HI) software teams across the company.[2] He is the designer of many of Apple's products, including the MacBook Pro, iMac, MacBook Air, iPod, iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, iPad Mini and iOS 7. Steve Jobs considered Ive to be his "spiritual partner at Apple," while Fortune magazine stated in 2010 that Ive's designs have "set the course not just for Apple but for design more broadly."[3][4][5]
Ive was born in Chingford, London, UK. His father was a silversmith who lectured at Middlesex Polytechnic[6] (now Middlesex University): "He's a fantastic craftsman, his Christmas gift to me would be one day of his time in his college workshop, during the Christmas break when no one else was there, helping me make whatever I dreamed up."[7]
Ive attended the Chingford Foundation School—then called Walton High School—in Stafford, UK. During his high school years, Ive was passionate about cars and it was this interest that led to his later career as a designer. Following graduation from Walton, Ive explored the option of studying car design in London, such as the course offered at the Royal College of Art; however, he encountered a learning environment that was off-putting: “The classes were full of students making vroom! vroom! noises as they drew.”[6]
Ive eventually elected to study industrial design at Newcastle Polytechnic (now Northumbria University), where items from his student portfolio, such as a hearing aid design, were exhibited at London's Design Museum.[6] Ive had been interested in "drawing and making stuff" since he was a teenager but was unsure of what area to specialise in after leaving Newcastle. After meeting with various design experts, he was drawn to product design[8] and commenced employment at London design agency Roberts Weaver group, his college sponsor.[6]
Ive explained that his discovery of the Apple Mac, after "having a real problem with computers" during his later student years, was a turning point. Fearing he was "technically inept", he felt the Apple user experience was a departure from the computer design at that time,[9] and was particularly impressed by the intuitive mouse-driven system.[6]
After a year with Roberts Weaver, Ive joined a London design startup called Tangerine, located in Hoxton Square where he designed a diverse array of products, such as microwave ovens and toothbrushes.[6] However, his frustration with the position reached a turning point after he designed a toilet, bidet and sink for client Ideal Standard, and the company's boss rejected Ive's work, stating that the products were too costly and looked too modern.[6][10] Ive was unhappy working for clients who he disliked and who didn't possess the same principles.[6] Apple was a Tangerine client that Ive appreciated and he had been acting in a consultancy role for the computer firm while at Tangerine, creating the initial Powerbook designs. Apple had actually been attempting to recruit him as a full-time employee for two years without success.[6]
Ive worked as a consultant for Apple's Chief of Industrial Design at the time Robert Brunner and eventually became a full-time Apple employee in 1992.[6][11] He designed the second generation of the Newton, the MessagePad 110, taking him to Taipei for the first time. Shortly before Jobs's return to Apple, Ive nearly resigned from the company. Jon Rubinstein, Ive's boss at the time, managed to retain Ive as an employee by explaining that Apple was "going to make history" following the revival of the company.[10]
He became the Senior Vice President of Industrial Design in 1997 after the return of Jobs and subsequently headed the industrial design team responsible for most of the company's significant hardware products.[12] Ive's first design assignment was the iMac; it helped pave the way for many other designs such as the iPod and eventually the iPhone and the iPad.[13] Jobs made design a chief focus of the firm's product strategy, and Ive proceeded to establish the firm’s leading position with a series of functionally clean, aesthetically pleasing, and remarkably popular products. Ive explained the close rapport that existed in his working relationship with Jobs in 2014: "When we were looking at objects, what our eyes physically saw and what we came to perceive were exactly the same. And we would ask the same questions, have the same curiosity about things." Ive described Jobs as "so clever", with "bold" and "magnificent" ideas.[6]
The work and principles of Dieter Rams, the chief designer at Braun from 1961 until 1995, influenced Ive's work. In Gary Hustwit's documentary film Objectified (2009), Rams says that Apple is one of only a handful of companies existing today that design products according to Rams' ten principles of "good design."[14][15]
Ive runs his own laboratory at Apple, in which he oversees the work of his appointed design team, and he is the only Apple designer with a private office.[8] Only his core team—which consists of a team of around 15 people from Britain, America, Japan, Australia and New Zealand who have worked together for around two decades—and top Apple executives are allowed into the laboratory, as it contains all of the concepts, including prototypes, that the design team is working on.[6] Ive also refuses to allow his children to enter the laboratory.[10] According to the Jobs biography, Ive's design studio contains foam-cutting and printing machines, while the windows are tinted. Jobs told biographer Walter Isaacson: "He has more operational power than anyone else at Apple except me."[16]
On 29 October 2012, Apple announced that "Jony Ive will provide leadership and direction for Human Interface (HI) across the company in addition to his role as the leader of Industrial Design."[17] With the WWDC13 announcement of the iOS7 and Ive's role as principal, the Apple Press information was also updated to reflect his new title: Senior Vice President of Design.
The scheduled publication of an unofficial Ive biography was announced in late 2013. Written by Leander Kahney, who conducted interviews with former Apple designers and executives, the book is titled Jony Ive: The Genius Behind Apple's Greatest Products.[10]
In March 2014, Time magazine published a feature interview with Ive, in which he revealed an optimistic view of his future with Apple:
We are at the beginning of a remarkable time, when a remarkable number of products will be developed. When you think about technology and what it has enabled us to do so far, and what it will enable us to do in future, we’re not even close to any kind of limit. It’s still so, so new ... At Apple, there’s almost a joy in looking at your ignorance and realizing, ‘Wow, we’re going to learn about this and, by the time we’re done, we’re going to really understand and do something great.’ Apple is imperfect, like every large collection of people. But we have a rare quality. There is this almost pre-verbal, instinctive understanding about what we do, why we do it. We share the same values.
In the same interview, Ive stated that he hopes that his best work is yet to emerge and that he prefers to be identified as a maker of products, rather than a designer. Ive believes that there is "a resurgence of the idea of craft" in 2014.[6]
Ive designed products for charitable causes, including a Leica camera for a charity auction that set a world record auction price for a camera[18] and a Jaeger-LeCoultre sports watch—only one of three in the world—for an AIDS-charity auction.[6]
In 1999, Ive was named by the MIT Technology Review TR100 one of the top 100 innovators in the world under age 35.[19]
In 2005 The Sunday Times named Ive one of Britain's most influential expatriates.: "Ive may not be the richest or the most senior figure on the list, but he has certainly been one of the most influential as the man who designed the iPod."
A 2006 Macworld magazine poll listed Ive's joining Apple in 1992 as the sixth most significant event in Apple's history, while Dan Moren, a writer at MacUser magazine (a subsidiary of Macworld), suggested in March 2006 that, when the time came for Steve Jobs to step down as the CEO of Apple, Ive would be an excellent candidate for the position, justifying the statement by saying that Ive "embodies what Apple is perhaps most famous for: design."[21] However, Jobs was succeeded by Tim Cook, the company's former COO.[22]
In 2007, Ive received the 2007 National Design Award in the product-design category for his work on the iPhone.[24]
In 2008, he was named the No. 1 "Most Influential Briton in America" by the Daily Telegraph.[25] Creativity Online included Ive in their "Creativity 50" list.[26] The same year, he was awarded the MDA Personal Achievement Award for the design of the iPhone.[27]
In 2009, Ive received an honorary doctorate from the Rhode Island School of Design,[28] and honorary doctor of the Royal College of Art.[29] Also in 2009, Fast Company put him at No. 1 on their list of "100 Most Creative People in Business;[30] the Daily Telegraph named him the second "Most Influential Briton in Technology,[31] Forbes magazine listed him as second amongst the "Most Powerful People in Technology;[32] and The Guardian named him "Inventor of the Decade".[33]
In 2010, Bloomberg BusinessWeek listed Ive among the "World's Most Influential Designers",[34] CNN Money named him "Smartest Designer" in their "Smartest People in Tech" story.[35] Ive was listed at No. 18 on "The Vanity Fair 100" list,[36] and Eureka of The Times group placed him No. 5 on their list of "Britain's Most Important Scientists";[37] Fortune named Ive the "world's smartest designer" for his work on Apple products.[38]
In 2011, the Daily Mail profiled Ive, hailing him as a "design genius".[39] He also was nominated for a British Inspiration Award.
In 2012, Vanity Fair gave Ive along with Tim Cook the first spot on their annual "New Establishment" List.[40]
In 2013, Blue Peter awarded Ive a gold Blue Peter badge[41] and he was then profiled by Bono in The 2013 TIME annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[42]
Ive was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2006 New Year Honours for services to the design industry. In the 2012 New Year Honours, he was elevated to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) for "services to design and enterprise";[43] he was knighted by Princess Anne in Buckingham Palace in a May 2012 ceremony.[44] He described the honour as "absolutely thrilling" and said he was "both humbled and sincerely grateful".[45][46]
As of early 2014, Ive is listed as an inventor on over 730 U.S. design and utility patents, as well as many more related patents around the world.[47]
Ive married British writer and historian Heather Pegg in 1987, with whom he raises twin sons. Ive has been publicised as a very private and low-profile public figure, while his family resides in the Pacific Heights district of San Francisco, California, US.[8] Ive avoids publicity and stated in March 2014 that Jobs was his “closest friend”, a person he finds it “odd and tough to talk about", as "it doesn’t feel that long ago that he died.” He also explained in 2014 that if his work at Apple ever became substandard, he would "make things for myself, for my friends at home instead.”[6]

  Different and new is relatively easy. Doing something that’s genuinely better is very hard.” Jony Ive    In 1997, Steve Jobs returned to Apple as CEO with the unenviable task of turning around the company he had founded. One night, Jobs discovered a scruffy British designer toiling away at Apple’s corporate headquarters, surrounded by hundreds of sketches and prototypes. It was then that Jobs realized he had found a talent who could reverse the company’s long decline.    That young designer was Jony Ive.     Jony Ive’s collaboration with Jobs would produce some of the world’s most iconic technology products, including the iMac, iPod, iPad, and iPhone. The designs have not only made Apple a hugely valuable company, they’ve overturned entire industries, built a loyal fan base, and created a globally powerful brand. Along the way, Jony Ive has become the world’s leading technology innovator, won countless design awards, earned a place on the 2013 Time 100 list, and was even knighted for his services to design and enterprise.”    Yet despite his triumphs, little is known about the shy and soft-spoken whiz whom Jobs referred to as his spiritual partner” at Apple. Jony Ive reveals the true story of Apple’s real innovator-in-chief.    Leander Kahney, the bestselling author of Inside Steve’s Brain, offers a detailed portrait of a creative genius. He shows us how Jony Ive went from an English art school student with dyslexia to the man whose immense insights have altered the pattern of our lives. From his early interest in industrial design, fostered by his designer father, through his education at Newcastle Polytechnic and meteoric rise at Apple, we discover the principles and practices that he developed to become the designer of his generation.    Based on interviews with Jony Ive’s former colleagues and Kahney’s own familiarity with the world of Apple, this book gives insight into how Jony Ive (now senior vice president of design) has redefined the ways in which we work, entertain, and communicate with one another.

  Very well structured and well written book!ChuckI bought the Audible book and the Kindle version of the book  I couldn't put the book down.Robert D. BluntReally detailed look at jony Ives life really enjoyed this a MUST read for any apple fan!jeramie edwards
I consider myself a casual Apple historian, in that I am a big fan of Apple’s work and through that interest I have learned a fair amount about their past. It is with much interest that I purchased Leander Khaney’s Jony Ive, a biography of Apple’s famed lead designer. A month ago, I linked to an excerpt about the beginnings of the first iPhone. It is quite good and had me excited to read the rest of the book. Unfortunately (but not unexpectedly) this was the best portion of the book by far.I was not turned off by the entire book[1]. The beginning, which talks about Ive’s education and work before Apple is informative, telling a story I doubt many are familiar with. Khaney’s descriptions of Ive’s early work at Apple were also enjoyable, covering the development of the Newton, the Twentieth Anniversay Mac, and the iMac. Part of me wonders, however, if these sections were more enjoyable only because I am less familiar with those product’s stories already. If I knew more about them, would I have found as many faults with Khaney’s writing as I did with the newer products that I am familiar with?The book is entirely effusive about Jony Ive, to the point of being annoying. The hockey puck mouse that shipped with the original iMac is only gently derided, and Ive’s tendency to supplant form over function is likewise given a pass. This gushing attitude hits its high in the final chapter, where credit for the success of the iPod, iPhone, and iPad is seemingly given entirely to Ive:> The iPod was a product of Jony’s simplification philosophy. It could have been just another complex MP3 player, but instead he turned it into the iconic gadget that set the design cues for later mobile devices.Read more ›
10 of 10 people found the following review helpfulI wish the "design story" idea was researched and discussed more
  I've read a lot about Jonathan Ive in the last 5-10 years, and while this book didn't add a lot to what I knew about him, it adds a few more nuggets. The most interesting part of the book for me is the concept of a "design story". It's mentioned several times in the book, and it's stated that Mr. Ive begins each project by thinking or saying, "What is the design story?" But sadly it's only glossed over, never discussed in detail. At about $15, I give this book four stars. If it was $25, I'd give it 2-3 stars.
I was excited to see a book on Jonathan Ive, the head of Industrial Design at Apple. He is a living legend – with the Queen’s knighthood no less - with the string of runaway hits Apple has had. Stories abound of how the finer things in life from forging of samurai swords to examples from marine biology influence his design thinking. Author Leander Kahney summarizes his enduring legacy with this comment “(Ive) introduced the concept of fashion to an industry previously preoccupied with speeds and feeds”I was also a bit concerned Kahney would fall into traps authors often fall into when they profile tech executives as I wrote recently – speculation without direct access to the subject, and a chronological version of the subject’s life. Kahney does but it does not affect this book as much. He focuses more on the huge product hits – the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone and iPad and uses his long term watching of Apple (he publishes the Cult of Mac) to use alumni and other contacts to weave enough of Ive into the descriptions. And unlike Walter Isaacson with Steve Jobs, he does not focus much on Ive’s youth other than to show the influence his dad and his consulting days in the UK had on his aesthetic sense.There is plenty of detail to savor – like the Daler Rowney sketchbooks preferred by the ID team, Bondi Blue translucence of the first iMac and Ive's minimalist stamp on the new iOS7. Apple fans will particularly relish these details of two decades of products they have enjoyed. Personally, I liked the design culture Kahney describes that Robert Brunner, IDEO, frog and others brought to the Valley in the 90s that have reshaped so many of our devices since. I also liked the fact he invokes anecdotes from auto, furniture and other product design from Italy, Japan and elsewhere.Read more ›
  To those of you who've read Walter Isaacson'n fabulous book on Steve Jobs, and are looking for the counterpart on Jony Ive: This isn't it. Ive is undoubtedly a fascinating guy (and to be fair, the books does give interesting glimpses into the important role Ive has plaid in most groundbreaking Apple products), but given that Ive has more or less dedicated his life to making things simple and elegant, I find it disappointing that this book fails so miserably at cutting away unecessary stuff.All the relevant stories are no doubt here, but they are too often written in a stilted, pedantic manner. It seems the author has felt obliged to quote everything that every single source has shared with him, regardless of how important it is or that someone has said it before (sometimes even in the previous paragrap, using much the same language). This struck me most in the beginning of the book, and while it gets somewhat less irritating farther on, it doesn't quite go away...
  Listen, if you want to know about Apple and Jony Ive read Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson. Kahney offers limited to no new insight in this book but manages to stretch out his non-point of view and lack of new information into a full length book. Looking through his copious citations in the back of the book, it is clear that Kahney saw an opportunity to make money and basically compiled a book report of everyone else's work into something resembling a biography.Furthermore, the presumable purpose of the book is to document Ive's life and rise to fame. Unfortunately, the second half of this literary waste of time is almost exclusively devoted to a play by play of Apple's corporate history with a heavy emphasis on Steve Jobs and internal Apple politics.Finally, Kahney is just a bad writer. On top of basically copying everyone else's existing work, he does so poorly. His prose is legitimately composed at a high school level with no consideration for style or grammatical structure. At numerous points throughout the book, I found myself rereading whole sentences because they just did not make sense or were written in the most awkward way imaginable.Avoid this. I forced myself to read the whole thing because I was hopeful that it would get better. It did not.
      A quick look at the history of Apple products through the lens of one the greatest designers. Jony Ive.
      This is by far the best book on the market explaining apple's corporate structure and how they get products to market
      Jony Ive is a fantastic and interesting subject, and is also notoriously private. Spoiler alert: he is not interviewed in this book.
      Seems like a nice in-depth follow-through of the Walter Isacsson's book. Well structured and easy reading -plus cool facts!-. Thanks.
      Really enjoyed this book.  Mahoney gives in a nice rundown of Ive's life...it was nice to read his childhood background and the influences of his father.  Good read.  I recommend.
      I got this book in New York few months ago, I didn't really had the time to read it too often, but every time I was reading It I got a lot of notes from this book.
      Nothing eartth shattering about Jony Ive here, he's still the mysterious guy, gives few interview fella we come to know.
      Details Actions behind the products we love.Story about Apple Design Success. It's more than just Steve Jobs.Joni Ive's story
      A well written book that really adds to the story behind Apple.  A different perspective than all the Jobs focused accounts.
      After reading all the negative reviews on this book I had to write this. If you don't work in a creative industry or you are simply an Apple fanatic, I can see that you may find...

=======================================================
After a string of early successes as Apple's design chief, Ive bought an Aston Martin DB9, only to get into a car accident one month later with a member of his design team, which nearly killed them both. Apple's reaction to the event was to give Ive a "big pay raise." Apparently, the car crash served as a wake-up call about just how valuable Ive was to the company. 
That is one of several new details about the secretive Apple designer found in Jony Ive: The Genius Behind Apple's Greatest Products, a forthcoming book from Leander Kahney, based on research and interviews with former Apple designers and execs. The unofficial biography sheds some light on Ive's upbringing, design inspirations and occasional clashes with execs at Apple.
Ive worked closely with Apple cofounder Steve Jobs for years, helping to create the hardware products that transformed Apple from a company on the verge of bankruptcy to the most valuable business in the world. In the post-Steve Jobs era, Ive's power at the company has only increased as he now runs hardware and software design. Yet, Ive has largely stayed out of the spotlight with the exception of the occasional pre-taped video at product launch events. 
Tim Cook may be the head of Apple, but Ive is its soul. With that in mind, here are 10 things we learned about Apple's soul from reading the new book.
1. Ive was cut from the same cloth as his father. Mike Ive worked as a silversmith and eventually helped craft a mandatory design curriculum for schools in the UK, which is credited with the rise of many British designers, including Jony. 
2. He designed mobile phones and even clocks (cue iWatch rumors) as a young student. As one of his professors recalled, "He designed some mobile phones that were slim and detailed, like modern phones, even while he was still a school student."
3. One of his first projects after college was designing a toilet for a client. He failed. Ive joined the design startup Tangerine in 1989 and was asked by a client to design a toilet, bidet and sink. The client rejected his designs because they were "too expensive to produce."
4. Ive nearly quit Apple shortly before Jobs returned to the company. His new boss Jon Rubinstein, who gave him a raise and a pep talk, convinced him otherwise. "We told him that we were going to struggle to get through where the company was then, and that once we turned the company, we were going to make history," Rubinstein says in the book. "Those were the terms we used to keep him at Apple."
5. Ive was the one who pushed Apple to embrace white products. Jobs was initially against using white, according to former Apple designer Doug Satzger, and was only convinced when presented with a different shade called moon gray. "Most of the things Jony did historically at design school in England were white, and he started pushing white at Apple," Satzger says in the book.
6. Jony loves techno music. It's often played in Apple's top secret design studio, which is described in the book as a noisy and "chaotic" place full of music and designers skateboarding and playing soccer.
7. He has the only private office in the design studio, which is described as being a "glass cube" with just a desk, chair and lamp, and no pictures of his family. The design studio itself is so restricted that even some top Apple execs like former iOS chief Scott Forstall were unable to go inside.
8. Ive isn't allowed to tell his wife what he's working on. Unlike some other members of his team, Ive also never lets his children come into the design studio.
9. Ive was one of two people who Steve Jobs requested to see after undergoing surgery for a pancreatic tumor in 2004. The other person was Jobs' wife, Laurene. 
10. Those who work with Ive say he doesn't want to become CEO of Apple. One former member of his design team told Kahney that "Jony doesn't care about all those aspects of running a company."

Jonathan "Jony" Ive, CBE (born February 1967) is an English designer and the Senior Vice President of Industrial Design at Apple He is the leading designer and conceptual mind behind the iMac, titanium and aluminum PowerBook G4, G4 Cube, MacBook, unibody MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iPod, iPhone, and iPad.
Jonathan Ive was born in Chingford, London in the year 1967. However his family moved to Staffordshire where he was raised. He was brought up by his teacher father and attended Chingford Foundation School. He went on to attend Walton High School in Stafford, and then studied Industrial Design at Northumbria University (Newcastle Polytechnic at the time). Once enrolled in Walton, it became clear that he attained many technical & drawing skills through his father. During this time, Jony along with his older band mates were in a band called, " White Raven," that played soft rock. They all attended the Wildwood Fellowship Church.[1] Ive also met his wife Heather Pegg during his high school years. She is a year younger than Ive. They married in 1987, and have twin sons. Their family now lives in San Francisco.
Jony himself has said that he knew he was interested in “drawing and making stuff” since around the age of 14. The idea of design was long in his mind but he was unsure as to what exactly he would design. His interests were very broad from furniture, to jewelry to even boats and cars. He was never sure where his curiosities would take him. It wasn’t until he met with various design experts that he was able to see some standard ground in wanting to further his study in product design.[2]
Ive was not always great with computers and actually found them quite frustrating. Technology to him was something he felt he was unable to grasp or that may not be for him. Once he discovered Apple’s Mac computers he felt more at ease. He realized they helped his once confusion and brought a newer and greater outlook to the technology of computers. For him this was a significant discovery because he was hoping to enhance his design skills using computers.[3]
After finishing school, Ive went on to becoming a cofounder to the London design agency Tangerine. Ive was soon hired in 1992 by Apple’s then Chief of Industrial Design Robert Brunner after a Tangerine consultancy with Apple. Ironically, Apple was one of Tangerine's clients.[4] He gained his current position at Apple in 1997 as Senior Vice President of Industrial Design after the return of Steve Jobs, and since then has headed the Industrial Design team responsible for most of the company's significant hardware products.[5] Ive's first design project happened to be the iMac which helped pave the way to many other designs such as the iPod & eventually the iPhone.[6] Jobs made design a chief element of the firm's product strategy and Ive proceeded to establish the firm’s leading position with a series of functionally clean, aesthetically pleasing and remarkably popular products.[7]
The work and principles of Dieter Rams, the Chief of Design at Braun from 1961 until 1995, have influenced Ive's work. In Gary Hustwit's documentary film Objectified (2009), Rams states that Apple is the only company designing products according to Rams' ten principles of "good design".[8][9]
Ives has his own lab with his appointed design team. They work to music that a close friend to Jony, DJ Jon Digweed provides.[10] It is said the majority of apple employees are not even allowed access into this laboratory.[11]hey guys steeeeeeeeeeeeeeevvvvvvvvvvvver
The Sunday Times named Ive as one of Britain's most influential expatriates on 27 November 2005: "Ive may not be the richest or the most senior figure on the list, but he has certainly been one of the most influential as the man who designed the iPod."
A recent Macworld poll listed Ive joining Apple in 1992 as the sixth most significant event in Apple history, while MacUser (a subsidiary of Macworld) writer Dan Moren suggested in March 2006 that, when the time comes for Steve Jobs to step down as CEO of Apple, Ive would be an excellent candidate for the position, justifying the statement by saying that he "embodies what Apple is perhaps most famous for: design."[12] However, Jobs was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook, the company's former COO.[13]
