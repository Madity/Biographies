      People magazine named him as having one of the "50 Most Amazing Bodies" in 2010 and as one one of the "Most Beautiful" in 2011.
      The songwriters decided to give Link a cool, upbeat, Elvis-style number, and it's the perfect time for it in the movie. 'Ladies Choice' establishes the connection between Tracy and Link. And it's the kind of number you need in a sixties musical: the rock 'n' roll band at the record hop, with bright colors and backup dancers.
      If I had to hear the High School Musical (2006) songs anymore, I would have jumped off of something really tall. [on why he chose not to do the High School Musical Tour.]
      The number one question I've been asked [for his movie 17 Again] is, 'If you could go back, would you change anything? If you could be 17 all over again, what would you do different? Would you go down this road?' I'm like, absolutely. This is like the best job in the world. I'm having the time of my life... It's always fun. It's always interesting. It's always a challenge. I'm very happy with that and I'm very happy with my life right now.
      You know what, I do not want to fall victim to partying too hard, it's too easy and too often done. It's out of style anyway, I think too many people have done it before me, I'm not going to. It's uncool, yeah. I think the rebellious thing to do would to actually be successful.
      On why he chose 17 Again: Everything else that was around was either a musical or a high school romance, you know, and this was actually the biggest risk and the biggest challenge. I can relate to playing a kid - I've had a first kiss, I've had awkward dates, I've had fights with my parents... But one thing I've never done is gotten into a fight with my teenage daughter.
      In the back of my mind, I can never forget this could be gone tomorrow - and at this point I think the odds are against me... the chances of succeeding in this business are slim to none; there's only a handful of people that have long careers. You have to put in the work, you can never be satisfied, never take it for granted.
      I'm not really into partying. Don't get me wrong - I've gone to a club. But I'd much rather be with my close friends at home or a concert, or on a trip. I'll go dancing with my grandma. She likes to cut a rug!
      I'm definitely not getting married. In this business, you're either getting married or they want you to be pregnant. I'm not getting married until I'm forty. If ever.
      No Twitter, no Facebook, no MySpace - nothing. So if you have me, it's a poser, don't talk to them. [on what social networks he doesn't use]
      [on Claire Danes] I was intimidated, even just the name Claire Danes carries such weight with it. I needed to be a worthy love interest in the film and I didn't know that I had any of the qualities necessary to woo a girl like her... Claire and I were trapped on an island together with nowhere to go for four weeks, like a reality show. My character was supposed to fall in love, but she was also supposed to be out of his league. After meeting Claire, that was definitely the way it was supposed to be.
      And man, you should see the faces on the kids. It's priceless, and I don't look down on, or think badly about, the High School Musical films. I have no regrets at all. I'm extremely proud of those movies, and will be forever.
      (On being famous) It's weird, but I don't feel like think I deserve any of the attention. There's really nothing but one audition for a Disney Channel movie that separates me from 2,000 other brown-haired, blue-eyed guys in L.A., you know?
      [on 'At Any Price' and the farming industry] I think the only real knowledge I had before I went to Iowa was what I learned from 'Food Inc'. But once I got there and developed these extensive relationships with the farmers, I realized that we're basically made of corn.

Zachary David Alexander "Zac" Efron (born October 18, 1987)[1] is an American actor and singer. He began acting professionally in the early 2000s, and became known as a teen idol after his lead roles in the Disney Channel Original Movie High School Musical, the WB series Summerland, and the 2007 film version of the Broadway musical Hairspray.[2][3][4] Efron has since starred in the films 17 Again, Me and Orson Welles, Charlie St. Cloud, New Year's Eve, The Lucky One, That Awkward Moment, Neighbors, and The Lorax (voice only).
Efron was born in San Luis Obispo, California,[5] and later moved to Arroyo Grande, California. His father, David Efron, is an electrical engineer at a power station, and his mother, Starla Baskett, is a secretary who worked at the same power plant.[6][7] Efron has a brother, Dylan,[1] and had, as he has described it, a "normal childhood" in a middle-class family.[3] He is an agnostic, having never been religious.[2] His surname, "Efron" (אפרון), is an Ashkenazi Jewish surname, taken from a Biblical place name[8][9] (his paternal grandfather was Jewish, and Zac has described himself as Jewish).[10][11]
Efron has said that he would "flip out" if he got a "B" and not an "A" in school, and has also described himself as having been a class clown.[12] His father encouraged him to begin acting when Zac was eleven years old.[6] Efron subsequently appeared in theater productions at his high school,[13] worked in the theater The Great American Melodrama and Vaudeville,[3] and began taking singing lessons.[6] He performed in shows such as Gypsy; Peter Pan; or, The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up; Little Shop of Horrors; and The Music Man. He was recommended to an agent in Los Angeles by his drama teacher, Robyn Metchik (the mother of actors Aaron Michael Metchik and Asher Metchik).[14][15] Efron was later signed to the Creative Artists Agency.[16]
Efron graduated from Arroyo Grande High School in 2006[17] and was then accepted into the University of Southern California, but has deferred his enrollment to work on film projects. He also attended Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts, a community college located in Santa Maria, California, which provided him with the opportunity to perform as a "young player" during the years of 2000 and 2001.[18]
In 2002, Efron began to appear in guest roles on several television series, including Firefly, ER, and The Guardian. He portrayed Cameron Bale on the now-cancelled WB series Summerland. Originally introduced as a recurring character, Efron became a regular cast member on the show in the second season in 2004, starring opposite the likes of Kay Panabaker, Lori Loughlin and Jesse McCartney. Since appearing in Summerland, he has also had guest roles on the shows CSI: Miami, NCIS, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and The Replacements. In 2003, Efron starred in the Lifetime original television movie Miracle Run. He played Steven Morgan, one of two autistic twins. For his performance, he was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Movie, Mini-series or Special — Supporting Young Actor.[19] In 2005, he played a main character in Hope Partlow's music video for her song "Sick Inside." Also in 2005, he played horse-loving Patrick McCardle in The Derby Stallion, where his character wants to beat the town bully at the steeple chase race.
In 2006, Efron starred in the Disney Channel original movie High School Musical as Troy Bolton, a popular student and captain of the basketball team. The film, which he initially made with "low expectations",[3] helped Efron gain recognition among teenage audiences as both an actor and a singer, even though his singing voice was overdubbed. As a result, he placed as high as #4 on the IMDBPro's STARMeter for the week of January 29, 2006.[20] In August 2006, Efron won a Teen Choice Award in the Breakout Star and the TV — Choice Chemistry categories, shared with Vanessa Hudgens. The film's cast, along with Efron, toured Sydney, Australia, London, England, and other locations to promote the film.
Shortly after High School Musical aired, on February 4, 2006, Efron debuted with two simultaneous charted songs on Billboard Hot 100 from the film: "Get'cha Head in the Game" and "Breaking Free", a duet with Hudgens. On the following week's chart, Efron had five simultaneous song credits from High School Musical: "Get'cha Head in the Game", "Start of Something New", "What I've Been Looking For: Reprise", "We're All in This Together" and "Breaking Free." "We're All in This Together" was credited to the whole High School Musical cast. "Breaking Free", at the time, made the fastest climb in the history of the Billboard charts, from #86 to #4 between the two weeks; the record was beaten by Beyoncé and Shakira's "Beautiful Liar".[21] Efron also appeared in the 2006 Disney Channel Games, as captain of the Red Team.
Efron's singing talents were disputed when it was revealed that Drew Seeley's voice was blended with his on the soundtrack of High School Musical.[22] An August 23, 2007 interview in Rolling Stone magazine revealed that he had been cast in High School Musical after the songs were written, and the songs (written for a tenor) were somewhat out of his baritone vocal range.
On April 7, 2007, Efron appeared in an episode of Punk'd. Efron also starred in the music video for Vanessa Hudgens's single "Say OK", in which he played her love interest. The video aired on March 16, 2007 on the Disney Channel. That year, he was named one of People magazine's 100 Most Beautiful People in 2007. A picture and short profile of him was in the section "Coming of Age". In it, he related how he was always the shortest kid in school (as of August 2007, he was 5'8")[7] and was teased for the "huge gap" in his teeth.[23]
In 2006, Efron was cast as Link Larkin in a film version of Hairspray released on July 20, 2007. Efron performed all of his own vocals in the role,[24] which was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, from September 5 to December 2, 2006. He cut and dyed his hair dark brown and gained about 15 pounds for the role.[25] His performance and the film received positive reviews.[14] Efron was not able to perform with his fellow castmates in High School Musical: The Concert because of commitments on the film Hairspray. Drew Seeley took over for him.[26]
High School Musical 2 aired in August 2007. At the time, Lycos reported searches for Efron surged by 81%.[27] The film set a new record, becoming the most watched basic cable program in U.S. history, with 17.2 million viewers.[28] Efron also appeared on the cover of the August 2007 edition of Rolling Stone.[2] The article about him revealed that he hoped to someday play an action hero. Efron presented the 2007 Teen Choice Award for "Favorite Movie" along with Queen Latifah, and later that year, he co-hosted the Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards with The Veronicas on October 10 in Sydney.[29]
In early 2008, Efron was cast in the lead role in the film Me and Orson Welles. Based on Robert Kaplow's novel of the same name,[30] the story, set in 1937 New York, tells of a teenager hired to star in Orson Welles' production of Julius Caesar, where he becomes attracted to a career-driven production assistant. The film was shot in the Isle of Man, London and New York, during February — April 2008. It was introduced to North America via the Toronto Film Festival on September 5, 6, and 11, 2008[31] and was released in 2009. Efron was also scheduled to star in Paramount's musical remake of the film Footloose,[32] and has said that he would like to add his "own little bit of flair" to the role originated by Kevin Bacon.[7] In March 2009, he dropped out of the film.[33] Efron was quoted as saying that while it was a promising gig, he left the project because he "was looking for a new challenge, and this was another musical."[34]
Efron reprised his role in High School Musical 3: Senior Year, which was theatrically released on October 24, 2008. His next role was in 2009's 17 Again, a high school-set comedy-drama produced by Adam Shankman and based on a pitch by Jason Filardi;[35] the plot involved an adult who is transformed into a 17-year old (played by Efron).[36]
On April 8, 2009, Efron's participation in a comedic short video entitled "Zac Efron's Pool Party" for the website Funny Or Die was released for public viewing.[37] On April 11, 2009, Efron hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live.[38] In early June 2009 it was confirmed that Efron would be making a guest appearance during the sixth season of HBO's comedy series Entourage.[39] Efron starred in a series of advertisements, along with Kristen Bell and Sean Combs, promoting the 2010 MTV Movie Awards and the host, Aziz Ansari. In 2009, he signed on to play title character in the movie Charlie St. Cloud.[40] The film was released on July 30, 2010.
Efron was second on People's 2011 Most Beautiful list.[41] That year, he appeared in Garry Marshall's New Year's Eve, which did well at the box-office, despite receiving many negative reviews from critics.[42] In 2012, he voiced Teg Wiggins in The Lorax and starred in The Lucky One, a film adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel of the same name. The same year, he also appeared in three independent films: he played leading roles in The Paperboy, alongside Nicole Kidman and John Cusack, and At Any Price, with Dennis Quaid, and had a supporting part in director Josh Radnor's Liberal Arts.[43][44]
In 2014, Efron starred in the romantic comedy That Awkward Moment, alongside Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan, and in the raunchy comedy Neighbors (with Seth Rogen), released on May 9.[45]
At various points, Efron's potential projects included the title role in the live-action adaptation of the Jonny Quest cartoons,[46] This Is Where I Leave You, an adaptation of Jonathan Tropper's comic novel,[47] Einstein Theory,[48] an adaptation of Fire, by Image Comics, and the American remake of Swedish crime film Easy Money.[49][50]
Efron was on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list in 2008 as number 92, with estimated earnings of $5.8 million from June 2007 to June 2008. As of April 5, 2009, his personal wealth equaled about $10 million.[51] People magazine said in 2007 that Efron and Vanessa Hudgens began dating in 2005 during the filming of High School Musical,[52][53][54] although Us magazine said, after the two broke up in December 2010, that they "met in 2005 while making the first High School Musical flick, and became a romantic item about two years later."[55]
Efron sought treatment in early 2013 after struggling with alcoholism and substance abuse. He has been sober since June 2013.[56]

Birth Name: Zachary David Alexander EfronBirth Place: San Luis Obispo, CADate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 10/18/1987, LibraProfession: Actor; singer
With his dreamy blue eyes and sexy smile, Efron became an instant teen heartthrob when he played a high-school basketball star who discovers his love for singing, dancing and an unpopular classmate in Disney's smash 2006 TV-movie High School Musical. The up-and-coming actor had a similar revelation off screen at age 11, when he began appearing in community theater productions of musicals such as Mame and The Music Man. In the 2000s, he began racking up small-screen guest spots, and even had a regular role on the short-lived drama Summerland. But Efron started realizing his true potential under Disney's tutelage, headlining HSM and appearing on the station's popular teen series The Suite Life of Zack and Cody. In 2007, he made a splash as an Elvis-like star in the movie musical Hairspray. Later in the decade, he turned to dramatic parts in such films as Me and Orson Welles and 17 Again.Zac Efron Fast Facts:
Duet with Vanessa Hudgens, "Breaking Free" (from High School Musical), jumped from No. 86 to No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in one week, the biggest leap at that point in the chart's history. 
The first new artist to have two songs ("Breaking Free" and "Get'cha Head in the Game") debut simultaneously on the Billboard Hot 100. 
In 2007, Rolling Stone dubbed him "the poster boy for tweenyboppers."  In an interview with the magazine at that time, he said he was more interested in acting than singing, and that his High School Musical vocals had been blended with those of another singer. 
He is clearly serious about acting, though, as he won prominent roles in two 2009 films, 17 Again and Me and Orson Welles. 
His nice-guy reputation comes from his belief that, once he thinks he's someone special, as he told thestar.com, "that's when I know I'm in trouble."Zac Efron Relationships: Vanessa Hudgens - Ex-significant OtherDavid Efron - FatherDylan Efron - BrotherStarla Efron - MotherZac Efron Awards: 2007 Screen Actors Guild Awards:  Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture - Nominee2013 People's Choice Awards:  Favorite Dramatic Movie Actor - Winner2011 People's Choice Awards:  Favorite Movie Star Under 25 - Winner

Tween-magnet and High School Musical hunk Zac was born into a middle class Calilfornian family. A school swot, he began singing and acting at age eleven, appearing in local theatre productions. He went on to enrol at the Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts, landing roles in made-for-TV movies and TV series like ER from 2002.
Zac’s big break came in 2006 when he won the part of Troy Bolton in High School Musical. The Disney sensation took the tween world by storm, spawning two further movies, a reality show, live tour, stage musical, ice show, book series, six computer games and five albums. Zac then launched a pop career too, having charts hits with songs from the High School Musical movies.
In a bid to shake of his tweeny image, Zac has yet to pole dance like Miley, or get naked onstage like Harry Potter. Instead he’s made TV appearances on grown up shows like Entourage and Saturday Night Live and starred in some grown up films, including Me and Orson Welles in 2008 and Charlie St. Cloud in 2010. He dropped out of the forthcoming remake of Footloose and is set to play the lead in the upcoming Jonny Quest movie instead.
In a match made in Disney heaven, Zac began dating his High School co-star Vanessa Hudgens during filming of the first movie in 2005. The couple split in 2010 and Zac has since been linked to Taylor Swift and another High School co-star, Ashley Tisdale.

Northern California native Zac Efron began his career onstage at the age of 11, playing a singing newsboy in a professional production of the musical Gypsy. His father had encouraged him to try out, after hearing Zac sing along with the radio. That led to appearances in stage productions such as Peter Pan, Mame, Little Shop of Horrors and The Music Man. 
At 14, he began to break into television with guest appearances on series such as Firefly, ER, The Guardian and CSI Miami, as well as roles in TV movies such as The Big Wide World of Carl Laemke (2003), Triple Play (2004) and Miracle Run (2004), for which he was nominated for a Young Artist Award for his portrayal of an autistic boy. 
In 2004, he began playing a recurring role on the WB series Summerland. His role gradually became larger and by the second season, he was a regular member of the cast. After the series ended, he landed a starring role as Troy Bolton in the Disney Channel TV musical movie High School Musical. It went on to become Disney Channel's most successful movie, with 7.7 million viewers during its premiere broadcast, while the soundtrack became the best-selling album of 2006. For his part, Zac won two Teen Choice AwardsChoice TV Breakout Star and TV Chemistry (with co-star Vanessa Anne Hudgens). 
The movie led to High School Musical - The Concert, featuring all the stars from the original castthat is, everyone but Zac, who was filming a plum role as a teen heartthrob in the movie musical Hairspray (2007) in Toronto at the time. However, he returned for the sequel, High School Musical 2 and the big screen release, High School Musical 3: Senior Year. 
Hoping to steer away from singing and dancing roles, Efron next starred in two very different films. He starred in the Warner Bros. film 17 Again, a Big-like dramedy in which a 36-year-old man, in need of a major
life do-over, wakes up in the body of a high-school senior. The film opened No. 1 at the box office and also starred Matthew Perry and Leslie Mann. Efron also starred in the Richard Linklater film Me and Orson Welles, an adaptation of the period coming-of-age
novel by Robert Kaplow. Efron portrayed a high-school student who happens upon the yet-to-open Mercury Theatre and is then noticed by Orson Welles. Efron starred in the
film alongside Ben Chaplin and Claire Danes, and it debuted to rave reviews at the Toronto International Film Festival.
Although he'd signed on to play Kevin Bacon's role in a remake of Footloose, he backed out on a technicality.
Following that, he took on what was the most dramatic role of his career to dateplaying a young man overcome by grief at the death of his younger brother in Charlie St. Cloud. He's also appeared in a string of other blockbusters, including New Year's Eve (2011), the voice of the lead character Ted in Dr. Seuss' The Lorax (2012), The Lucky One (2012) and At Any Price (2013). He most recently starred in Parkland(2013), That Awkward Moment (2014) and Neighbors (2014). 
In his spare time, Zac relaxes by surfing, skateboarding, golfing, fixing up cars and hanging out with friends. He also enjoys horse back riding, since learning to ride for the video release The Derby Stallion (2005) and shooting hoops, after undergoing extensive basketball training for his role as a jock in High School Musical.  
In 2007, he was named one of People magazine's 100 Most Beautiful People. Zac would like to go to the University of Southern California to study film, so he can eventually continue his career behind the camera.
