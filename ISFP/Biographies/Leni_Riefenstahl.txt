=======================================================
LENI RIEFENSTAHL was born in Berlin in 1902. She studied painting and started her artistic career as a dancer. She became already so famous after her first dance hat Max Reinhardt engaged her for the »Deutsches Theater«.
An injury of the knee put an end to her sensational career. After that, she became famous as an actress, a film director, a film producer and a film reporter. She became world-renowned as an actress in the films »Der heilige Berg« (1926), »Der große Sprung« (1927), »Die weiße Hölle vom Piz Palü« (1929), »Stürme über dem Mont Blanc« (1930), »Der weiße Rausch« (1931), »Das Blaue Licht« (1932) and «SOS Eisberg» (1933).
Her greatest success she made with the documentary film »Triumph des Willens« named after the Reich Party Congress 1934 in Nuremberg which got the highest awards: The gold medal in Venice in 1935 and the gold medal at the World Exhibition in Paris in 1937. However, at the end of the war this film destroyed Leni Riefenstahl's career, for now it had no longer been recognized as a piece of art but been condemned as a National Socialist propaganda film. Her world-famous film about the Olympic games made the same experience. That film included two parts, part I »Fest der Völker« and part 2 »Fest der Schönheit« , and did also get the highest awards: the gold medal in Paris in 1937, the first price in Venice as the world's best film in 1938, the Olympic Award by the IOC in 1939, and in 1956 it had been classified as one of the world's best ten films.
															12. In 18 months of work, Leni cut 400.000 metres of film material for the Olympic games film with this little Lytax
As a photographer, too she soon gained the world's elite after the war. Photo reportages about her stay with the Nuba were first published in the magazines »Stern«, »The Sunday Times Magazine«, »Paris Match«, »L'Europeo«, »Newsweek« and »The Sun«. Mainly her illustrated books »The Nuba« and »The Nuba of Kau« earned her further honours and awards.
At the age of 71, Leni Riefenstahl fulfilled a dream to herself, she had cherished for long: She attended a diving course to be able to also work as an underwater photographer in the future. Soon she became a master in this profession too. With her two illustrated books, »The coral gardens« and »The wonders under water« she had caused a worldwide sensation and got further honours and awards for them. In 1987, Leni Riefenstahl published her »Memoirs« which meanwhile have come out in 13 countries and reached a high circulation mainly in Japan and in the USA. In 1992, the documentary film »Die Macht der Bilder« was produced over several months at original scenes where she herself could express her opinion about her life and her artistic work. This film too got several international awards - among them the »Emmy Award« in the USA and in Japan the special price of the film critics.
Exhibitions of her photographs had been successfully organized i.a. in Tokyo (1980 and 1991), in Kuopio (Finland), in Milan and Rome (Italy), in Munich, Potsdam and Berlin (Germany), in Calpe (Spain) and in Knokke Heist (Belgium). Others are in preparation. In between, she is working untiringly on the finishing of her first underwater film, and that is why she visited the most wonderful diving areas repeatedly. Even at the age of 94, she dived in Cocos Island (Costa Rica) and took pictures of sharks.
									Even more unusual was her decision at the age of 97 to travel to the Sudan being isolated because of the civil wars which had been going on there for many years, in order to research the fate of her beloved Nuba and to bring them help. For 23 years she had not heard anything from her Nuba friends for it had been impossible to her to get an entry permission. After long efforts, she finally had it, and she was even able to contact the rebel leader. Together with a small film team provided by the Odeon-Film Company, she travelled to Khartoum in February 2000 accompanied by Horst Kettner, her assistant of many years standing. First after a long time of waiting and hard negotiations, the team could travel to the Nuba mountains under the protection of a military convoy. Thousands of Nuba people were waiting for Leni Riefenstahl who has to know upon her arrival that her best friends had become victims of the civil war. She was deeply shattered. Nevertheless, she wanted to search for her other friends still alive but this did not happen anymore. Because of the breaking out of new fights, she was forced to leave the Nuba mountains immediately. No protests did help. The team had to leave by a helicopter. Another disaster followed soon. After a stopover in El Obeid the helicopter crashed. As if by a miracle, there had been no dead but only injured. Leni Riefenstahl had to be taken by a rescue plane to a German hospital where they found that she had suffered a number of rib fractures the points of which had hurt the lungs. Despite this dreadful accident, she will not give up her plan to travel the Sudan once again to help her Nuba friends.
Leni Riefenstahl died on Monday 8 September 2003, in Poecking, Germany. She died a few weeks after her 101st birthday.
=======================================================
Helene Bertha Amalie "Leni" Riefenstahl (German: [ˈʁiːfənʃtaːl]; 22 August 1902 – 8 September 2003) was a German film director, photographer, actress and dancer widely known for directing the Nazi Party propaganda film Triumph of the Will. Riefenstahl’s prominence in the Third Reich, along with her personal association with Adolf Hitler, destroyed her film career following Germany's defeat in World War II, after which she was arrested but released without any charges.[2]
Triumph of the Will gave Riefenstahl instant and lasting international fame, as well as infamy. She directed eight films, two of which received significant coverage outside Germany. The propaganda value of her films made during the 1930s repels most modern commentators, but many film histories cite the aesthetics as outstanding.[3][4][5][6] The Economist wrote that Triumph of the Will "sealed her reputation as the greatest female filmmaker of the 20th century".[7]
In the 1970s, Riefenstahl published her still photography of the Nuba tribes in Sudan in several books such as The Last of the Nuba. Active until her death at age 101, she published marine life stills and released the marine-based film Impressionen unter Wasser in 2002.
After her death, the Associated Press described Riefenstahl as an “acclaimed pioneer of film and photographic techniques”.[8] Der Tagesspiegel newspaper in Berlin noted, “Leni Riefenstahl conquered new ground in the cinema”.[9] The BBC said her documentaries “were hailed as groundbreaking film-making, pioneering techniques involving cranes, tracking rails, and many cameras working at the same time”.[10]
Christened Helene Bertha Amalie also known as Leni Riefenstahl, was born into a prosperous German Protestant family on 22 August 1902.[11] Her affluent father, Alfred Reinfestahl owned a successful heating and ventilation company and he wanted his daughter, Leni to follow him into the world of business. Since Leni was the only child he had at that moment, he wanted her to carry on with the family name and also secure the abundant money he had made.[12] However, her mother, Bertha Scherlach who had been a part time seamstress before her marriage had faith in Leni and believed that her future was in show business. Luckily for the Reinfestahl family, they brought a male child into the world three and half years later after Leni. Heinz Reinfestahl, Leni’s brother was later killed at the Russians war front of Hitler’s war when he was Thirty Six years old. Leni was one to have fallen in love in the Art field. At the Age of 4, she began to paint and write poetry. Leni was also athlethic that at the age of twelve, she decided to join a “Nixe,” a gymnastic and swim club. The more she grew, the more her mother perceived her talents in the artistic world. She knew her daughter would grow up to be successful in the field of Art and therefore gave her full support unlike Leni’s father who was not interested in any artistic motives in his daughter’s life. In 1918, when she was 16, she attended a presentation of “Snow White” from which a developed a very deep interest and she concluded that she wanted to be a dancer. Her father could not agree less with her idea of becoming a dancer. He instead wanted to provide her with an education that could lead to a more dignifying profession rather than being a Dancer. But instead, his wife did not fail to continue to support her daughter’s passion. They went behind Alfred’s back to enroll Leni in dance and ballet classes at the Grimm-Reiter Dance School in Berlin, where she quickly became a star pupil.[citation needed]
Riefenstahl gained a reputation on Berlin's dance circuit and even became more popular with times that she travelled. With more dancing, she began getting feet injuries that had to lead to a knee surgery. Although she was sad about her knee and was also sad at the fact that she might have to stop dancing as a result. Who could have told that this was a blessing in disguise? On a faithful day while she waited at the train station to go resolve her health problem with a family doctor, she came across a captivation poster that enchanted in a second. This moment had to a turning point in Leni’s life. This poster in question was in relation of “Der Berg des Schichsals: Ein Film von Dr. Arnold Fanck.” Unknowing to her she had already missed her appointment to go see her family Doctor. That moment she decides she is done with dancing and would rather go into films. She began visiting the cinema watching pictures and also attending shows of films.
On one of her adventures, she met with Luis Trenker who was one of Arnold Fanck’s actors. She was also able to meet with Arnold Fanck on an arranged meeting by a friend of hers, Gunther Rahn. Arnold was working on a film in Berlin, where Leni expressed her love and passion for his works and was able to convince him on an acting skill and persuaded him to please feature her in one of his movies after he must have gone through her folder. She later received a package from Dr. Fanck which was a script to Arnold Fanck’s “Der Heilige Berg.” That was a dream come through.She made a series of films for Arnold Fanck. He trained her very well and also taught her ways to go about while editing a film. One of Arnold film that brought her outstandingly into limelight was, The White Hell of Pitz Palu (1929), co-directed by G. W. Pabst It saw her fame spread to countries outside of Germany. Riefenstahl produced and directed her own work called Das Blaue Licht (1932), co-written by Carl Mayer and Béla Balázs. This film won the Silver Medal at the Venice Film Festival. In the film, Riefenstahl played an innocent peasant girl who was hated by the villagers because they had the impressions that she was diabolic hence leading to the death of many beings in their village. She was being hated and casted away by so many. She always protected a glowing mountain grotto. The film attracted the attention of Hitler, who believed she epitomized the perfect German female. He saw the tremendous talent in her and the great works that she had done and invited her for a meeting.
Riefenstahl took dancing lessons and attended dance academies from an early age and began her career as a self-styled and well-known interpretive dancer, traveling around Europe and working with director Max Reinhardt in a show funded by Jewish producer Harry Sokal.[13][14] After injuring her knee while performing in Prague, she saw a film about mountains, entitled Mountain of Destiny (der Berg des Schicksals, 1924), and became fascinated with the possibilities of this sort of film.[15] She went to the Alps to meet the film's director, Arnold Fanck, hoping to secure the lead in his next project.[15] Instead, Riefenstahl met Luis Trenker who had starred in Fanck's films, who wrote to the director about her.
Riefenstahl went on to star in many of Fanck’s mountain films as an athletic and adventurous young woman with a suggestive appeal; she became an accomplished mountaineer during the winters of filming on mountains and learned filmmaking techniques.[15] Riefenstahl went on to have a prolific career as an actress in silent films. She was popular with the German public and highly regarded by directors. In 1930, she lost the lead role in the Josef von Sternberg-directed The Blue Angel to her neighbour, Marlene Dietrich.[16] Her last acting role before becoming a director was the 1933 U.S.-German co-productions of the Arnold Fanck-directed, German-language SOS Eisberg and the Tay Garnett-directed, English-language SOS Iceberg. The movies were filmed simultaneously and produced and distributed by Universal Studios. SOS Iceberg was Riefenstahl’s only English-language film role as an actress. One of her fans at this time was Adolf Hitler.[7] Riefenstahl accompanied Fanck to the 1928 Olympic Games in St. Moritz, where she became interested in athletic photography and filming.[15]
When presented with the opportunity to direct Das Blaue Licht (The Blue Light) (1932), she took it. Breaking from Fanck's style of setting realistic stories in fairytale mountain settings, Riefenstahl—working with leftist screen writers Béla Balázs and Carl Mayer—filmed Das Blaue Licht as a romantic, wholly mystical tale which she thought of as more fitting to the terrain.[2] She co-wrote, directed and starred in the film and produced it under the banner of her own company, Leni Riefenstahl Productions.[15] Das Blaue Licht won the Silver Medal at the Venice Biennale and played to full audiences all over Europe.[15] However, it was not universally well-received, for which Riefenstahl blamed the critics, many of them Jewish.[17] Upon its 1938 re-release, the names of co-writer Béla Balázs and producer Harry Sokal, both Jewish, were removed from the credits; some reports claim this was at Riefenstahl’s behest. The director later turned over the name of her Jewish co-screenwriter to Nazi Propagandist Julius Streicher.[17][18] Riefenstahl received invitations to travel to Hollywood to create films, but she refused the offers in order to stay in Germany with a boyfriend.[2]
Riefenstahl heard candidate Adolf Hitler speak at a rally in 1932 and was mesmerized by his talent as a public speaker. Describing the experience in her memoir, Riefenstahl wrote: "I had an almost apocalyptic vision that I was never able to forget. It seemed as if the Earth's surface were spreading out in front of me, like a hemisphere that suddenly splits apart in the middle, spewing out an enormous jet of water, so powerful that it touched the sky and shook the earth".[19] According to the Daily Express of 24 April 1934, Leni Riefenstahl had read Mein Kampf during the making of her film The Blue Light. This newspaper article quotes her as having commented, "The book made a tremendous impression on me. I became a confirmed National Socialist after reading the first page. I felt a man who could write such a book would undoubtedly lead Germany. I felt very happy that such a man had come". She wrote to Hitler requesting a meeting. After meeting Hitler she was offered the opportunity to direct Sieg des Glaubens (Victory of Faith), an hour-long propaganda film about the fifth Nazi Party rally at Nuremberg in 1933. Riefenstahl agreed to direct the movie after returning from filming a movie in Greenland, and it was funded entirely by the Nazi Party as the credits to the film show quite clearly.

Impressed with Riefenstahl’s work, Hitler asked her to film the upcoming 1934 Party rally in Nuremberg, the sixth such rally. At first, according to Riefenstahl’s memoir, she resisted and did not want to create further Nazi films; instead, she wanted to direct a feature film based on Hitler’s favourite opera, Eugen d'Albert's Tiefland.[19] Riefenstahl received private funding for the production of Tiefland, but the filming in Spain was derailed. Hitler was able to convince her to film Triumph instead, on the condition that she not be required to make further films for the party. She also told Hitler she wanted the freedom to act again: "I would not be able to go on living if I had to give up acting". The resulting chronicle of the Nuremberg Rally, Triumph des Willens (named by Hitler), was generally recognized as an epic, innovative work of propaganda filmmaking.[citation needed] Triumph of the Will became a rousing success in Germany.[citation needed] It made Riefenstahl the first female film director to achieve international recognition.[citation needed] In interviews for the 1993 film The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, Riefenstahl adamantly denied any deliberate attempt to create pro-Nazi propaganda and said she was disgusted that Triumph of the Will was used in such a way.
Despite vowing not to make any more films about the Nazi Party, in 1935, Riefenstahl made the 18-minute Day of Freedom: Armed Forces about the German army. Like Victory of Faith and Triumph of the Will this was filmed at the annual Nazi Party rally at Nuremberg. Riefenstahl never denied making this short 18 minute film. However she always claimed this film was a sub-set of Triumph of the Will added to mollify the German army which felt it was not represented well in the 1934 filming of Triumph of the Will. Over a million Germans had participated in the 1934 rally in Nuremberg. Later, yearly rallies held in Nuremberg got even bigger. The 1935 rally is noted for pronouncements about the status of Jews in Germany. These became known as the Nuremberg Laws which for Jews in Europe would soon become matters of life and death.
In 1936, Hitler invited Riefenstahl to film the Olympic Games in Berlin, a film which Riefenstahl claimed had been commissioned by the International Olympic Committee. She also went to Greece to take footage of the games' original site at Olympia, where she was aided by Greek photographer Nelly, along with route of the inaugural torch relay. This material became Olympia, a successful film which has since been widely noted for its technical and aesthetic achievements. She was one of the first filmmakers to use tracking shots in a documentary, placing a camera on rails to follow the athletes' movement, and she is noted for the slow motion shots included in the film. Riefenstahl’s work on Olympia has been cited as a major influence in modern sports photography. Riefenstahl filmed competitors of all races, including African-American Jesse Owens in what would later become famous footage.
Olympia was very successful in Germany after it premiered for Hitler’s 49th birthday in 1938, and its international debut led Riefenstahl to embark on an American publicity tour in an attempt to secure commercial release. In 1937, Riefenstahl told a reporter for the Detroit News: "To me, Hitler is the greatest man who ever lived. He truly is without fault, so simple and at the same time possessed of masculine strength". She arrived in New York City in November 1938, five days before Kristallnacht, or 'night of broken glass'; when news of the event reached the U.S., Riefenstahl maintained that Hitler was innocent. On 18 November, she was received by Henry Ford in Detroit and Olympia was shown at "The Chicago Engineers Club" two days later. Avery Brundage stated that it was "The greatest Olympic film ever made" and Riefenstahl left for Hollywood, where she was received by the German Consul Georg Gyssling, on 24 November. She negotiated with Louis B. Mayer and on 8 December, Walt Disney brought her on a three-hour tour showing her the on-going production of Fantasia.[20]
After the Goebbels Diaries surfaced, researchers learned that Riefenstahl had been friendly with Joseph Goebbels and his wife, Magda, attending the opera with them and coming to the Goebbels' parties.[6] However, Riefenstahl maintained that Goebbels was upset that she had rejected his advances[17] and was jealous of her influence on Hitler, seeing her as an internal threat; therefore, his diaries could not be trusted. By later accounts, Goebbels thought highly of Riefenstahl’s filmmaking but was angered with what he saw as her overspending on the Nazi-provided filmmaking budgets.[17]
During the Invasion of Poland, Riefenstahl was photographed in Poland wearing a military uniform and a pistol on her belt in the company of German soldiers;[21] she had gone to the site of the battle as a war correspondent.[18] On 12 September 1939 she was in the town of Końskie when 30 civilians were executed there, in retaliation for an alleged attack on German soldiers.[22] According to her memoir, Riefenstahl tried to intervene but a furious German soldier held her at gunpoint and threatened to shoot her on the spot.[19] She claimed she did not realize the victims were Jews.[17] Closeup photographs of a distraught Riefenstahl survive from that day.[17] Nevertheless, by 5 October 1939, Riefenstahl was back in occupied Poland filming Hitler’s victory parade in Warsaw.[22] She left Poland[18] and apparently chose not to make any Nazi-related movies after this, however.[16]
On 14 June 1940, the day Paris was declared an open city by the French and occupied by German troops, Riefenstahl wrote to Hitler in a telegram, “With indescribable joy, deeply moved and filled with burning gratitude, we share with you, my Führer, your and Germany's greatest victory, the entry of German troops into Paris. You exceed anything human imagination has the power to conceive, achieving deeds without parallel in the history of mankind. How can we ever thank you?”[22][23] She later explained: “Everyone thought the war was over, and in that spirit I sent the cable to Hitler”.[18] Riefenstahl was friends with Hitler for 12 years, and reports vary as to whether she ever had an intimate relationship with him.[24] According to Ernst Hanfstaengl, who was a close friend of Hitler throughout the later 1920s and early 1930s, Riefenstahl tried to begin a relationship with Hitler early on but was turned down by him.[25] For whatever reason, her relationship with Hitler had declined by 1944, when her brother Heinz died on the Russian Front of the war.[16]
After the Nuremberg rallies trilogy and Olympia, Riefenstahl began work on the movie she had tried and failed to direct once before, Tiefland. On Hitler’s direct order the German government paid her 7 million reichsmarks in compensation.[26] From 23 September until 13 November 1940 she filmed in Krün near Mittenwald. The extras playing Spanish women and farmers were drawn from gypsies (Sinti) detained in a camp at Salzburg-Maxglan who were forced to work with her. Filming at the Babelsberg Studios near Berlin began 18 months later in April 1942 and lasted into summer. This time Sinti and Roma from the Marzahn detention camp near Berlin were compelled to work as extras.[27] A surviving document from camp Marzahn shows a list of 65 inmates who were ordered to serve in the production.[28] 50 stills from the filming in Krün near Mittenwald were later found and from these, surviving prisoners were able to identify 29 camp inmates who worked for Riefenstahl and were then deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau in the first weeks of March 1943 following Himmler’s December 1942 decree.[29][30] Almost to the end of her life, despite overwhelming evidence that concentration camp occupants had been forced to work on the movie unpaid,[25] Riefenstahl continued to maintain all the film extras survived and that she had met them after the war.[31] Riefenstahl sued a filmmaker, Nina Gladitz, who said Riefenstahl personally chose the extras at their holding camp; Gladitz had found one of the Gypsy survivors and matched his memory with stills of the movie for a documentary Gladitz was filming.[32] The German court found largely in favour of Gladitz, agreeing that Riefenstahl had known the extras were from a concentration camp, and they agreed with Riefenstahl on only one count (rejecting the claim that Riefenstahl had informed the Gypsies that they would be sent to the Auschwitz camp after filming was completed).[32]
This issue came up again in 2002, when Riefenstahl was one hundred years old and she was taken to court by a Roma group for denying the Nazis had exterminated gypsies. Riefenstahl apologized, saying, “I regret that Sinti and Roma had to suffer during the period of National Socialism. It is known today that many of them were murdered in concentration camps”.
The last time Riefenstahl saw Hitler was when she married Peter Jacob on 21 March 1944, shortly after she had introduced Jacob to Hitler in Kitzbühel, Austria.[18] Riefenstahl and Jacob divorced in 1946;[15] Jacob became involved with Henriette von Schirach.
In October 1944 the production of Tiefland moved to Barrandov Studios in Prague for interior filming. Lavish sets made these shots some of the most costly in the film but they were finished within days. The film was not edited and released until almost 10 years later.
As Germany’s military collapsed in the spring of 1945 Riefenstahl left Berlin[15] and was hitchhiking with a group of men, trying to reach her mother, when she was taken into custody by American troops. She walked out of a holding camp, beginning a series of escapes and arrests across the chaotic landscape. At last making it back home on a bicycle, she found that American troops had seized her house, then was surprised by how kindly they treated her.[33]
Writer Budd Schulberg, assigned by the US Navy to the OSS for intelligence work while attached to John Ford’s documentary unit, was ordered to arrest Riefenstahl at her chalet in Kitzbühel, Austria, ostensibly to have her identify the faces of Nazi war criminals in German film footage captured by the Allied troops. Riefenstahl claimed she was not aware of the nature of the internment camps. According to Schulberg, “She gave me the usual song and dance. She said, ‘Of course, you know, I'm really so misunderstood. I'm not political.’” However, when Riefenstahl later claimed she had been forced to follow Goebbels’ orders under threat of being sent to a concentration camp, Schulberg asked her why she should have been afraid if she did not know concentration camps existed. When shown photographs of the camps, Riefenstahl reportedly reacted with horror and tears.
Riefenstahl continued to maintain she was fascinated by the National Socialists but politically naïve and ignorant about any war crimes. From 1945 through 1948 she was held in sundry American and French-run detention camps and prisons along with house arrest but although Riefenstahl was tried four times by various postwar authorities, she was never convicted through denazification trials either for her alleged role as a propagandist or for the use of concentration camp inmates in her films. However, she was found to be a fellow traveler who was sympathetic to the Nazis.
Riefenstahl later said that her biggest regret was meeting Hitler: “It was the biggest catastrophe of my life. Until the day I die people will keep saying, ‘Leni is a Nazi’, and I’ll keep saying, ‘But what did she do?’” Although she won more than 50 libel cases against people accusing her of collaborating with the Nazis, there are many unanswered questions[specify] about her relation to National Socialism in particular and fascism more generally.
Most of the negatives for Riefenstahl’s finished films and other production materials relating to her unfinished projects were lost towards the end of the war. The French government confiscated all of her editing equipment, along with the production reels of Tiefland. After years of legal wrangling these were returned to her, but the French government had reportedly damaged some of the film stock whilst trying to develop and edit it and a few key scenes were missing (although Riefenstahl was surprised to find the original negatives for Olympia in the same shipment). She edited and dubbed what elements were left and Tiefland premiered on 11 February 1954 in Stuttgart, however, it was denied entry into the Cannes Film Festival.[33] Although Riefenstahl lived for almost another half century, Tiefland was her last feature film.[34]
Riefenstahl tried many times (15 by her count)[15] to make films during the 1950s and 1960s but was met with resistance, public protests and sharp criticism. Many of her filmmaking peers in Hollywood had fled Nazi Germany and were unsympathetic to her.[15] Although both film professionals and investors were willing to support her work, most of the projects she attempted were stopped owing to ever-renewed and highly negative publicity about her past work for the Third Reich.[33] In 1956, inspired by Ernest Hemingway's 1935 novel Green Hills of Africa, she began an ambitious film project in Africa drawn from another novel called Schwarze Fracht (Black Freight).[16] While scouting shooting locations, she almost died from injuries received in a truck accident. After waking up from a coma in a Nairobi hospital, she finished writing the script there, but was soon thoroughly thwarted by uncooperative locals, the Suez Canal crisis, and bad weather (only test shots were ever made).[citation needed]
In 1954, Jean Cocteau insisted on Tiefland being shown at the Cannes Film Festival, which he was running that year.[13] Cocteau greatly admired the film.[35] In 1960, Riefenstahl unsuccessfully attempted to prevent filmmaker Erwin Leiser from juxtaposing scenes from Triumph of the Will with footage from concentration camps in his film Mein Kampf.[15] Riefenstahl had high hopes for a collaboration with Cocteau called Friedrich und Voltaire, wherein Cocteau was to play two roles. They thought the film might symbolize the "love-hate relationship" between Germany and France. Cocteau's illness and 1963 death put an end to this project.[33] A musical remake of The Blue Light with L. Ron Hubbard, a small-time U.S. pulp science fiction writer, also fell through.[36]
In the 1960s, Riefenstahl became interested in Africa from Hemingway's book and from the photographs of George Rodger.[35] Rodger, who had taken the first photographs of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, refused to help Riefenstahl meet Africans, citing their respective backgrounds.[35] Riefenstahl took up photography, documenting a diverse array of subjects. She traveled many times to Africa[22] to photograph the Nuba tribes in Sudan, with whom she sporadically lived, learning about their culture so she could photograph them more easily.[33] She began a lifelong companionship with her cameraman Horst Kettner, who was 40 years her junior and assisted her with the photographs; they were together from the time she was 60 and he was 20.[37] She was granted Sudanese citizenship for her services to the country, becoming the first foreigner to receive a Sudanese passport.[38]
Her books with photographs of the tribes were published in 1974 and 1976 as The Last of the Nuba and The People of Kau and were both international bestsellers.[22][39] While heralded by many as outstanding colour photographs, they were harshly criticized by Susan Sontag, who claimed in a review that they were further evidence of Riefenstahl’s “fascist aesthetics”.[40] The Art Director’s Club of Germany awarded Leni a gold medal for the best photographic achievement of 1975.[38] She also sold the pictures to German magazines.[33] She photographed the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich and rock star Mick Jagger and his wife Bianca for the Sunday Times.[13] Years later she photographed Las Vegas entertainers Siegfried and Roy. She befriended Andy Warhol and was a Guest of Honour at the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal.[15]
In her later years, Riefenstahl became known for her longevity and physical stamina, although she often suffered considerable pain from old injuries. At age 72, Riefenstahl began pursuing underwater photography after lying about her age to gain certification for scuba diving (she cut 20 years off her age). In 1978, she published a book of her sub-aquatic photographs, Korallengärten (Coral Gardens) followed by the 1990 book; Wunder unter Wasser (Wonder under Water).[15] On 22 August 2002, her 100th birthday, Riefenstahl released a film called Impressionen unter Wasser (Underwater Impressions), an idealized documentary of life in the oceans and her first film in over 25 years.[22] At age 100, she was still photographing marine life and gained the distinction of being the world's oldest scuba diver.[35] Riefenstahl was a member of Greenpeace for 8 years.[41]
She survived a helicopter crash in Sudan in 2000 while trying to learn the fates of her Nuba friends during the Sudanese civil war and was airlifted to a Munich hospital.[16]
After Riefenstahl celebrated her 101st birthday on 22 August 2003 at the extravagant hotel in Feldafing, nearby her home at Lake Starnberg in the Bavarian province of Germany, which was an extraordinary festivity. The guest list consisted of 200 people including Germany most prominent socialites such as glitzy magicians Siegfried and Roy. Furthermore, the following day after her birthday celebration, she became ill.
According to her assistant Horst Kettner who was her domestic partner for 38 years; he stated that, “Ms. Riefenstahl is in great pain and she has become very weak and is taking painkillers.” Her health had been deteriorating for nearly a month. Leni Riefenstahl died in her sleep on the late evening of 8 September 2003 at her home in Pöcking, Germany. She had been suffering from cancer for a while before her death. She was buried in Munich's Waldfriedhof cemetery.
There was varied response in the obituary pages of leading publications, although most recognized her technical breakthroughs in film making:
was perhaps the most talented female cinema director of the 20th century; her celebration of Nazi Germany in film ensured that she was certainly the most infamous...Critics would later decry her fascination with the athletes’ [Olympia] physiques as fascistic; but in truth her interest was born not of racist ends but of the delight she, as a former dancer, took in the human form.[42]
Opinions will be divided between those who see her as a young, talented and ambitious woman caught up in the tide of events which she did not fully understand, and those who believe her to be a cold and opportunist propagandist and a Nazi by association.[15]
At the end of her long life she was still the controversial femme fatale of German films...She was interested in beauty, adventure and films, but she was famous for being the woman you love to hate.[43]
In his book The Story of Film, film scholar Mark Cousins claims, "Next to Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock, Leni Riefenstahl was the most technically talented Western film maker of her era".
Reviewer Gary Morris called Riefenstahl "an artist of unparalleled gifts, a woman in an industry dominated by men, one of the great formalists of the cinema on a par with Eisenstein or Welles".[44] Pauline Kael called Triumph and Olympia "the two greatest films ever directed by a woman".[37]
New York Times film critic Hal Erickson states that while the Triumph of the Will’s “Jewish Question” is mainly unmentioned, “filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl prefers to concentrate on cheering crowds, precision marching, military bands, and Hitler’s climactic speech, all orchestrated, choreographed and illuminated on a scale that makes Griffith and DeMille look like poverty-row directors."[45] The recurring topic of a female director with such prowess and force executing such a work was apparently resented by propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels “but finally had to admit that her images, achieved through the use of 30 cameras and 120 assistants, were worth a thousand speeches.”[45] While it may be “possibly the most powerful propaganda film ever made, Triumph of the Will is also, in retrospect, one of the most horrifying.”[45]
New York Times film critic Hal Erickson says of Riefenstahl, “Having proven her mettle with her still-astonishing propaganda epic Triumph of the Will, German filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl furthered her reputation with the two-part Olympia.”[46] While the first half of the film is unique in its portrayal of “non-true Aryan” athletes, especially the emerging star of Jesse Owens, “The second half of the film is the more impressive technically, with Riefenstahl utilizing an astonishing variety of camera speeds and angles to record the diving competition.”[46] Showing Riefenstahl’s work ethic and perseverance, her crew began “Working 16 hours a day, seven days a week.” [46] Though, “Riefenstahl and her staff were often denied desirable camera angles,” they were forced “to improvise with telephoto lenses.” [46] The results of this ingenuity are “far more dramatically impressive than the up-close-and-personal approach taken by contemporary TV cameramen.”[46]
Critic Judith Thurman says in her piece in the The New Yorker that “Riefenstahl’s “genius” has rarely been questioned, even by critics who despise the service to which she lent it.” Riefenstahl was a “consummate stylist obsessed with bodies in motion, particularly those of dancers and athletes.”[47] Her two most famous films, Olympia and Triumph of the Will are critiqued by Thurman, who says, “In both, Riefenstahl relies heavily for her transitions on portentous cutaways to clouds, mist, statuary, foliage, and rooftops. Her reaction shots have a tedious sameness: shining, ecstatic faces—nearly all young and Aryan, except for Hitler’s.”[47] Thurman claims that very few people actually see Riefenstahl’s full work, saying “many people, even film buffs, seem never to have seen—or are unaware of never having seen—Riefenstahl’s documentaries in their entirety,” which leads people to believe that “If, by definition, the trailer for a so-called masterpiece can never be greater than the film itself, then Riefenstahl’s legacy fails the test.”[47]
Writer Richard Corliss wrote in Time magazine that he was "impressed by Riefenstahl’s standing as a total auteur: producer, writer, director, editor and, in the fiction films, actress."[48] On the subject of her films being classic works, and not simply propaganda, Corliss argues that "The issues her films and her career raise are as complex and they are important, and her vilifiers tend to reduce the argument to one of a director's complicity in atrocity or her criminal ignorance."[48] The reason, Corliss states, that people discredit her work, and continue to do so, is the fact that she is a woman, saying, "Riefenstahl’s sin, I suspect, was being a woman — a woman who, uniquely, dared to play the man's game of filmmaking. Play and win, for, by any disinterested standard, Triumph of the Will and Olympia are towering artistic achievements."[48] Even though "she shot her last feature film, Tiefland, in the early 40s, and released it in 1954, Riefenstahl is still the world's most controversial director; her name summons the conflicts of defiant artistry and compromised morality."[48] But regardless of political opinion "Riefenstahl’s visual style — heroic, sensuous, attuned to the mists and myths of nature" will always be celebrated, though at the time it was not in "critical fashion." [48] "Finally, Riefenstahl was a woman, a beautiful woman. When she was seen with Hitler, their photos made the world's front pages. And the image stuck."[48] In 2008, Yukihiko Yoshida did a study called [49] “Leni Riefenstahl and German expressionism: research in Visual Cultural Studies using the trans-disciplinary semantic spaces of specialized dictionaries.” The study took databases of images tagged with connotative and denotative keywords (a search engine) and found Riefenstahl’s imagery had the same qualities as imagery tagged “degenerate” in the title of the exhibition, "Degenerate Art" in Germany at 1937.
In 1993, she was the subject of the Emmy Award-winning German documentary film The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, directed by Ray Müller.[50] Riefenstahl appeared in the film and answered several questions and detailed the production of her films.[51][52] The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl was an idea she had. Leni was motivated by her old age and for some time was working on her memoirs, decided to commission this documentary to tell her life story about the struggles she had gone through in her personal life, her film-making career, and what people thought of her. In the documentary Leni Riefenstahl said that her biggest mistake was meeting Hitler: "It was the biggest catastrophe of my life. Until the day I die people will keep saying, 'Leni is a Nazi'. At one point Muller asked a specific question to Leni about what her films were meant to be and not what most people thought they were and she insisted that her films were never meant to advance the political program of National Socialism, that she looked at the world with the pure, disinterested eye of an artist, and cared only about the noble task of giving vivid cinematic form to contemporary events. She was also the subject of Müller's 2000 documentary film Leni Riefenstahl: Her Dream of Africa, documenting her return to Sudan to visit the Nuba.
The Guardian reported in April 2007 that British screenwriter Rupert Walters was writing a movie based on Riefenstahl’s life which would star actress Jodie Foster.[22] The project had been in the works for more than seven years under the working title The Leni Riefenstahl Project.[53] The project is co-produced by Primary Pictures and Foster's own Egg Pictures.[53] Foster said in 1999, "There is no other woman in the 20th century who has been so admired and vilified simultaneously".[53] The project had not been able to capture Riefenstahl’s consent while she was alive, since Riefenstahl requested the ability to veto any scenes she did not agree with; Riefenstahl also preferred Sharon Stone as the star of the movie rather than Foster.[22][54] Both Foster and Madonna had sought the rights to Riefenstahl’s autobiography since the early 1990s.[13] Director Paul Verhoeven corresponded with Riefenstahl about a separate film biography.[54] In 2011, the director Steven Soderbergh revealed that he had spent 6 months working on a biopic of Riefenstahl. He ultimately abandoned the project over concerns of its commercial prospects and instead pursued the pandemic thriller, Contagion.[55]
Riefenstahl’s filming merits are discussed between characters in the Quentin Tarantino film Inglourious Basterds. Tarantino explained the significant presence of Third Reich filmmaking in his film: “Riefenstahl and Goebbels despised each other. He was in charge of every single person in the German film industry with the sole exception of her”.[56]
Leni, an award winning play by Sarah Greenman, is based on the life and work of Leni Riefenstahl. It saw productions in Oakland, California in 2004, Portland, Oregon in 2007, Seattle, Washington in 2008, and was showcased at the New York Fringe Festival in 2007.[citation needed]
A play based on Riefenstahl, Playing Leni (originally titled Dysfictional Circumstances) by David Robson and John Stanton, won the Hotel Obligado Audience Choice Award for New Work at the 2010 Spark Showcase in Philadelphia. It subsequently received a staged reading at the Philly Fringe Festival and was produced in May 2011 by Madhouse Theater.[citation needed]
Riefenstahl was referenced a number of times in the movie-lampooning television show, Mystery Science Theater 3000. In a season 8 episode of the show, as the characters in the show watch the 1950s horror film The Leech Woman, the lead female character of the film is transformed to a younger version of herself with a potion. Robot Tom Servo, upon seeing the newly rejuvenated character, says: “They turned her into Leni Riefenstahl!” The director was also mentioned by an MST3k character as they watched a short 1950s film Century 21 Calling; at one point Crow rhetorically asks “Did Leni Riefenstahl direct this?” as the blond, idealized-teens enthusiastically cavort at the Seattle World's Fair.

Leni Riefenstahl (Helene Riefenstahl) was a German dancer, actress, and film director best known for her imposing propaganda films in support of the National Socialist (Nazi) Party. 
Born in Berlin on August 22, 1902, Riefenstahl began her long and extraordinary career as an interpretive dancer. After a knee injury temporarily halted her vocation, Riefenstahl became fascinated with the possibilities of the medium of film, especially nature films. She became the star of a number of German director Arnold Fanck's silent motion pictures, typically set in the Alps (so-called Bergfilme), in which the young Riefenstahl figured as the athletic and daring female lead. 
Popular as an actress with German audiences in the silent era, Riefenstahl directed her first major feature film, Das blaue Licht (The Blue Light), in 1932. The film was well received, and more importantly attracted the attention of a rising politician who prided himself on having artistic ambitions, Adolf Hitler. In the same year, Riefenstahl had heard Hitler speak at a public rally and was riveted by his oratorical style and his ability to mesmerize audiences. 
Hitler saw Leni Riefenstahl as a director who could use aesthetics to produce an image of a strong Germany imbued with Wagnerian motifs of power and beauty. In 1933, he asked Riefenstahl to direct a short film, Der Sieg des Glaubens (The Victory of Faith), shot at that year's Nuremberg Nazi Party Rally. The film was a template for her more famous work, Triumph des Willens (Triumph of the Will), shot at the Nuremberg Rally the following year, in 1934. Riefenstahl initially rebuffed Hitler's commission for the film, but relented when she received unlimited resources and full artistic license for the picture. Triumph of the Will, with its evocative images and innovative film technique, ranked as an epic work of documentary film-making, and is widely regarded as one of the most masterful propaganda films ever produced. It won several awards, but forever linked the film's subject, National Socialism, with its artist, Riefenstahl. 
Equally stunning were Riefenstahl's directorial efforts in Olympia, which captured with haunting effectiveness the images of the 1936 Summer Olympic Games in Berlin. It was for Olympia that Riefenstahl pioneered numerous cinematographic techniques, such as filming footage with cameras mounted on rails (commonly known today as tracking shots). Olympia's forceful blend of aesthetics, sports, and propaganda again won Riefenstahl accolades and awards, including Best Foreign Film honors at the Venice Film Festival and a special award from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for depicting the joy of sport. 
By her own account, the advent of World War II and the rapid escalation of violence under the Nazi regime had an unfavorable effect on both Riefenstahl and her career. Early in the Polish campaign, an incident seemed to have shaken Riefenstahl's confidence in the movement she had glorified in cinematic images. While accompanying German troops near Konskie, the filmmaker witnessed the execution of Polish civilians shot in retaliation for a partisan attack on German troops. Riefenstahl apparently left her filming that day in order to make a personal appeal to Hitler against such arbitrary violence. The incident may have planted a seed of doubt in Riefenstahl's mind, but it did not prevent her from filming Hitler's triumphal parade into Warsaw just weeks later. 
After the war Riefenstahl attempted to separate herself from the criminal nature of the Nazi regime, suggesting her duty was to her craft and not necessarily to the Nazi authorities who commissioned her films. In what she and others would later claim was an effort to eschew further propaganda efforts, Riefenstahl had begun filming Tiefland (Lowlands) in 1940. A story set in the Spanish Pyrenees, Tiefland was a project that she had earlier shelved when persuaded by a determined Hitler to undertake Triumph of the Will. Shot on location near Kitzbühl, Austria, the filming dragged out over nearly four years. In order to enhance the story's “gypsy” flavor, Riefenstahl aides arranged to “borrow” some 51 young Roma prisoners from the nearby labor camp at Maxglan-Leopoldskron as extras. For the indoor scenes, filmed in Berlin-Babelsberg in 1942, Riefenstahl used as extras at least 66 Roma and Sinti inmates, virtually all males, from the Berlin-Marzahn camp for Gypsies. Allegations that the German Criminal Police returned the Roma, after fulfilling their “obligation,” to the Maxglan and Marzahn Gypsy camps (Zigeunerlager) and later deported them to their deaths at Auschwitz, were serious enough to involve Riefenstahl in a civil suit. That suit was dropped in 2002 only after her production company retracted a public statement Riefenstahl had made in which she claimed that all of the extras had survived the war. Tiefland premiered in 1954, eight years after French authorities occupying the Tyrol arrested Riefenstahl and confiscated her film materials, in January 1946. 
In the postwar years, Leni Riefenstahl was the subject of four denazification proceedings, which finally declared her a Nazi sympathizer (Mitläufer). Although never a member of the Nazi Party, Riefenstahl found it difficult to overcome her association with the propaganda films she had made during the early Nazi period, and encountered difficulties in regaining her position in the German cinematic community. Her experience was quite unlike that of her colleague Veit Harlan, who had directed such seminal Nazi propaganda works as Jüd Süss and Kolberg, but who returned to a flourishing directorial career in the 1950s. Riefenstahl turned to still photography, publishing in the 1970s an illustrated volume on the primitive Nuba tribe of the Sudan; in her late seventies, she undertook a new interest in underwater cinematography. 
Throughout her long career Leni Riefenstahl achieved a new aesthetics in film and introduced groundbreaking cinematic techniques, but she could never escape her past association as a Nazi propagandist and remained a controversial figure until the end of her life. She died of cancer in Pocking, Germany, on September 8, 2003, a few weeks after her 101st birthday. 
=======================================================
 For Alfred Riefenstahl, the owner of a secure and successful heating and ventilation firm based in Berlin, and his wife Bertha Scherlach, August 22, 1902 was the date of the proud birth of their first child that they named Helene Bertha Amalie (aka Leni) Riefenstahl.  Little did either of the young parents realize that their new child would ultimately prove to be one of the most controversial and influential females in an artistic field that, at the time, was still very much in its youthful development.  
Alfred was said to have wanted his first child to be a son so that he could carry on the firm that had provided a secure amount of wealth to the Riefenstahl family.  However, as the young girl Leni grew into young adulthood, she felt her passions grow in the artistic direction that had been a staple of her mothers life.  At the age of 4, Leni began to write poetry and paint.  Along with this, Leni felt that from a very early age she was an athletic child, due to the behest of her father.  At age twelve, she recalled joining a local gymnastics and swim club called "Nixe".  It was her mother that noticed that Leni had quite the artistic bent.  She perceived that Leni had the ability to paint with a natural understanding of composition and balance, which were two of the profound qualities in the later films of Leni Riefenstahl.  
Then, like one of those signpost moments that define Riefenstahls life and career, she visited the theatre for a presentation of the ballet "Snow White".  From that moment on, and without question, she knew that she was to become a dancer.  Along with the theatre, her hobbies as a child were to read Fairy Tales out of childrens magazines.  One could see the profound effect of her hobbies in her later works, such as Das Blaue Licht. Still, Lenis father wished that she would take up the business or another suitable profession.  Luckily for Leni, just three years after her birth the family got a baby boy they named Heinz, who later went on to die on the battlefields in World War II.  Alfred did very little in the way to support his daughters natural talent, leaving the mother to nurture the childs interest in the arts.  Instead, his intentions were to provide Leni with an education that would lead her into a profession that he considered respectable, and not the arts.  Frau Riefenstahl, without the knowing of her husband and going against his expressed wishes, took Leni to the ballet more and more as her passions grew for dancing.  By 1910, the now 16-year-old Leni became insatiably fond of the art of the dance she decided to try her hand by enrolling into a small dance program in Berlin called the Grimm-Reiter School.   As her training continued, the family found it most difficult to keep this passion a secret from Alfred, who when he found out became outraged at the idea of Leni becoming a dancer.  Leni recalled that he even went so far as to consider divorcing because of the secret his family kept from him.  He believed so little of Leni and her talents that he opted for her to enter into Berlins most prestigious ballet school.  His logic was that by entering her into the highly prestigious school, she would come to the realization that she had a lack of talent and would therefore be required to be forced out and to ultimately bend to the will of her father.  However, upon entering into the Russian Ballet School in Berlin it became quite apparent that Alfreds plans had crumbled when Lenis teacher, Hertha, who instructed at the Jutta Klammt School, had taken note of Lenis unique character and style of dance.  
Dancehalls throughout Europe, at this time before the war, were being filled with a variety of new dance styles that reflected the growing esteem for movements such as modernism and futurism.  One could see the wide ranges of styles from the precision and tradition of the Bolschoi to the newfound and highly experimental "naturalism" style of dance.  Riefenstahl found that through the later style of dance that she was more inclined to artistically express herself. It was a different style then had been seen before and Leni often felt like the outsider.  "I was always different from the others.  I designed my own costumes, choreographed my own performances", she explained.  However, she quickly realized that she was not alone in her ambition to create and follow a new school of dance.  Others, such as Isadora Duncan, Mary Wigman, or Rudolf von Laban, had the same reaction and created a dance that followed the bodys natural tendency to move with grace.  Wigman took it upon herself to open a new school that rejected the ideals of the "artificial" style of dance and soon Riefenstahl was under her tutelage.  
Although her career as a dancer took her all throughout the stages of Europe, she soon saw her dreams blighted when she repeatedly found herself susceptible to feet injuries.  Leni recalls at least three times she suffered injuries that sidetracked her dance career. It took her toll enough to warrant a knee surgery that would surely slow her career, yet it had to be done if she had wished to continue her dancing.  However, while waiting in the U-Bahn station on a June day in town heading towards a family doctor, she paused enough to gaze upon a poster.  What she saw in the station that day ultimately proved to be the major turning point in the life of Leni Riefenstahl.  On that poster was the image of a frozen mountaintop with a male figure making his way up to the peak. The title of the poster rang out "Der Berg des Schichsals: Ein Film von Dr. Arnold Fanck". In a daze of wonder, she had not only missed her train and subsequent appointment but in that moment, she realized a new future for herself.  In a matter of minutes, she had then found herself in the cinema across the square waiting for the picture to begin.  For the next week, Leni found herself attending as many of the showings of the film at Mozart Hall as possible.  	
The images of Der Berg des Schichsals, with its sense of "real people in real danger", intrigued Leni to such a degree that she quickly began to venture out into the Dolomites with her brother to see the locations herself. On one of the trips up to the mountains, she was able to meet Luis Trenker, who was the leading man of the Fanck film that was having a showing at a local hotel.  Meanwhile, back in Berlin, Lenis close friend, Günther Rahn, was able to arrange a café meeting with Dr. Fanck, who was in town dealing with UFA on a film.  In the meeting, Leni, with her passion for the "Mountain Genre" of film that Fanck was the creative force behind, was able to charm Dr. Fanck into allowing her to submit her portfolio with a pending suggestion of a possible role in his still yet undecided film.  That very night, the pain of her knee forced her to go into the hospital for immediate surgery.  Just three days later, Dr. Fanck made a surprise visit to recovering Leni and produced for her a script with the special dedication to her: Written for the dancer Leni Riefenstahl.  The script was for Fancks next feature film, Der Heilige Berg.
While her professional life was blossoming with newfound paths, her personal life during this period took a drastic turn for the worst as she found out that her fiancé, Otto Froizheim, whod she been dating for some time, had been found to be carrying on an affair.  She told him that the wedding was off, however, he kept sending her flowers and letters pleading for a pardon.  Then, as pre-production for her first film took place she found herself the attention of both Trenker and Fanck on the set of Der Heilige Berg, which produced an odd tension for the production of the film.  Also, while working on the project, Leni got the chance to follow the complete process of narrative films by watching and partaking in the films post-production. She says that, "Fanck taught me how to edit a film, a job that enthralled me"(55).  Later, the film would premiere and go onto greater box-office returns, thus making Leni a marketable actress in her own right.  However, what lingered for her was the choice that needed to be made: should she return to her successful dance career or proceed into filmmaking?  In the end, with to much time lost and pain suffered, she closed her dreams of a dance career and settled on filmmaking.
With the success of her first film, she was able to become more involved in her next roles.  Dr. Fanck allowed her to go into the Dolomites to train with a climber, to whom shed quickly grown fond of.  The trips were in order to improve on her skills, as they now became increasingly more important in the scripts, which demanded a female lead able to carry out dangerous climbs.  For her next film, Die Weisse Hölle vom Piz Palü, Leni was able to work under the direction of Dr. Fanck, who directed the nature scenes and actions shots, and also G.W. Pabst, who directed the more emotional scenes.  Leni was also able to secure the talents of one of Germanys most famous stunt pilot Ernst Udet, who would provide the film with a new flare for the dramatic.  
The shooting conditions for Die Weisse Hölle vom Piz Palü took a tremendous toll on the actors, in particular Leni.  Each day began with the actors and crew hiking up into the steep walls of ice and rock just to get to the location of that days shot.  Most days the shoots were in weather that was sub-zero with gusts of wind and snow.  The actors also found themselves taking huge risks in order to get the most perfect action shot that Dr. Fanck wanted.  As shooting continued, Leni found herself taking more of an interest into the process of how a film was made.  She noted that it was "Pabst, and not Fanck, who first realized [she] had a talent for direction"(69).  When the brutal shooting stopped, Leni came back to Berlin and waited for her next project to come around.  Shed hoped it to be something more then just an action film because she knew that from working with Pabst, and his more emotional scenes in the film, that she could carry herself as a true actress.   Yet her next project was something she did not expect.  Harry Sokal, the producer of the Fanck films and one-time admirer of Leni, gave her the opportunity to try her hand at editing.  As the case was, Dr. Fanck had edited the film but it still ran far to long for distribution into the markets of France, England, and the U.S.  He approached Leni with the offer of 300 marks and all expenses if she would go to Paris and re-edited the footage for worldwide release.  She declined at first, in order to hold out for more money, but soon caved in just for the chance to go to Paris.  When she finished the final edit of the film, she had successfully trimmed the film down to feature length and also discovered that she had quite a talent for the process.  After studying Fanck and his process of editing and tricks of the trade, she soon found it quite easy and enjoyable to splice film together, which would later prove to become her biggest role as director of her own films.
The film made its premiere in November of 1929 at Berlins UFA Palace by the Zoo.  It was a wild success for Fanck, who had fought the critics for years with his previous films.  The film also enjoyed a health success in both France and the U.S, where it grossed large numbers and quickly made Fanck a fortune.  Still, Fanck was driven to create more challenging films, as could be seen in his next film Stürme über dem Mont Blanc.  Fanck, for this film, wished it to be a talkie that would provide sound on the strip of celluloid.  This was clearly a tall order, as sound in film was still quite inadequate for the style and genre of Fancks films.  So Fanck relented and shot the film as a silent. Again, the shooting was very difficult and Leni became more annoyed with the films she was involved it.  After the shoot, she came back to Berlin and rethought her career.  
During this brief period between breaks in shooting with Fanck, she began to let her imagination run free.  She had also begun to remember her dreams more clearly then before.  She noted that it was from this came the basis of her first ideas for a film.  What she saw was an "image of a young girl who lived in the mountains, a creature of nature.  [She] saw her climbing, saw her in the moonlight; I watched her being chased and pelted with stones, and finally [she] dreamed of this girl as she fell away from a wall of rock and slowly plunged into the depths"(89).  Quickly, a 17-page treatment was written up and handed around to the various creative minds that she knew.  Each gave her a vote of support but offered no hope for the project to get off the ground.  What she couldnt get across in the script was an image that she had conjured in her head of a world unlike that of Fanck, which was real and dangerous, but a quite and simple world, like a fairy-tale.  She summoned the help of one of the best screenwriters in town, Béla Balázs, to help her craft the perfect script to her treatment.  Yet, the people with experience, like Fanck, told her that her notions of this fairy-tale world would create a gigantic budget.  She knew that they were right in this regard. With a smaller budget in mind, she gathered up the best crew she could get for as little money as possible.  Still, she was short on the money to produce the film and she ended up working once more for Fanck on his film Weiße Rausch, in order or to support her own film.  
While on the shoot, Balázs journeyed up into the mountains to help Leni out with the script. After the film was over, Leni finally had the money in order and also the script finished. Still, she needed a director and ended up forcing herself in the role because of the lack of funds. The crew she put together was mostly the crew from Fancks films, yet worked for next to nothing.  Shed found her locations and sent her crew ahead to a tiny town in the north of Italy. What she had envisioned was a different approach to creating filmmaking in the realm of the fairy tale. Shed wanted a natural setting to a fairy-tale, which had not been done successfully.  Yet, in order to have the ideal that she wished for, she needed to use light and film much more differently then what she had seen with Fanck.  She wrote to AGFA, a world-leader in film stock, and asked them to produce a film stock that would create a hazy sense of color that tinted the picture more.  Although this was a high request, AGFA agreed to produce the film stock.  She soon put everything she had on the selling block, clothes, flat, pictures, and family jewels, and took up the reigns as director of her own first feature film. 
After the first few cans of film had been sent back to Berlin, shed received a wire from Harry Sokal, who had wished to produce the film based on the outcome of what he saw in the rushes.  Leni was beyond excited and was now able to focus more on the creation of art instead of the finances of the film.  After the 10-week summer shoot, she had returned to Berlin to begin the editing process.  She employed Fanck do the initial editing of the film but turmoil quickly erupted when his edits didnt please Leni.  What she saw in the rushes was "more powerful" then what she had even imagined.  Yet, she allowed Fanck to go ahead and complete the edits and breakup the most stunning images into fragments.  The results were, in her eyes, disastrous, and relationship between Fanck and Riefenstahl became even more strained.  From then on, she took the thousands of strips of film and began to re-edit the film with the ideal notion of what she had hoped it to be.  
In Berlins UFA Palace on March 24, 1932, Leni saw the grand Premiere of her film, Das Blaue Licht.  The press and their reviews of the Film were fabulous to both Leni and her film.  She was completely taken by the response to the film.  Letters from the world-famous poured in daily expressing their fondness for the film and Lenis talents.  Shortly after the success of the premiere and the response of the press, Leni took her film on a tour of Germany.  On that tour in 1932, she had begun to develop a stark realization of the deep depression and after-effects that the First World War had on Germany.  It was also during this period that the National-socialist party had begun to gain political momentum with their leader, Adolf Hitler. 
Riefenstahl first remembered hearing of the political name of Adolf Hitler around the filming of Das Blaue Licht.  However, at this time, Hitler was a large political force in German politics.  Riefenstahl attests to a naivety about the political world due to her rigorous and involving filmmaking during Hitlers political rise that his name had sadly no recognition for her.  Yet, Hitler had noticed Leni and her work in Das Blaue Licht along with the earlier Fanck films and would later call on her and her talents for the Party. In late February of 1932, she attended one of his election speeches at the excited and overcrowded Berlin Sports Palace.   Once again, like at the films, she was struck by the power of this moment that she had to make up her own mind and meet the speaker.  She quickly wrote a letter to the Nazi paper "Völkischer Beobachter", in which she requested a meeting with Hitler before she had to leave Germany for a Fanck shoot in Greenland.  What remains fact is blurred by the various stories and versions that are told of this first meeting between Hitler and Leni. The most valid story is that Hitler had offered to meet with Leni around May 22, just days before she was to board a ship for Greenland.  Leni, again making one of her quick opportunistic choices, decided to quickly keep the meeting with Hitler and hopefully make it to the pre-production launch for Greenland.  After the meeting with Hitler in Wilhelmshaven, Leni arrived at the dock for the production launch to Greenland late and without a conclusive excuse.  
This next film for Fanck was something unusual because it was under the U.S. production of Universal; and it involved the travel to Greenland, which Leni found irresistible.  Still, the team remained tight: Fanck, Riefenstahl, and ace flyer Udet, once again provided outstanding aerial shots.  It was rare occurrence that anyone, including the Dutch, would be allowed into Greenland because of the health and sociological effects that could possibly take place with the native Eskimos.  The shoot for S.O.S Eisberg was entirely unlike the films Leni had done for Fanck previously.  She was now one of nine other women on the shoot, not just the only one.  They also had the luxury of having ample treatment courtesy of Universal.  The landscape, although still quite harsh, was not what Leni had first perceived it to be. Leni found the land magical.  For leisure she would often travel alone and experience all she could of Greenland.  She valued her free time there, doing what she may, while she "glided through gates of ice, past glittering and towering icebergs, through shimmering grottoes, whose walls were reflected all the way down into the water  green, pink, blue, and violet"(112).  Still, the shoot was extremely dangerous, probably more-so then any other shoot, due to the setting, which was unpredictable, moveable, and powerful icebergs.  Along with that, for this shoot, Fanck wanted to incorporate bears into the plot.  Nevertheless, the shoot was going smoothly and once again, Leni found love while on the set.  This time with a handsome Swiss man named Walter Prager, who worked as a trainer on the set.  The affair developed out of friendship and "lasted for over two years"(133).  Once the Greenland location shooting was complete, Leni traveled back to Berlin and again met with Hitler, who was awaiting her return.  During this brief pause in the shooting, around November of 1932, Leni was introduced to key figures that would go onto play roles in the Third Reich, such as Dr. Goebbels, who was promoted to "Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda" once Hitler came to power.  His role in both Lenis personal life and profession life would be a thorn in her side. In anycase, the film was still incomplete and going overscheduled.  Leni was called back to shoot the interior scenes at a Swiss local for SOS Eisburg.  These massive sets, which were to depict a large ice-cave, were some of the finest ever built, for Fanck or any other film.  Meanwhile, Hitler, who had been struggling to keep his party from folding under bankruptcy, had within mere weeks come directly into power as he took the chair of Chancellor for all of Germany.
 Since then, a year had passed since the premiere of Das Blaue Licht, and Lenis world was completely unrecognizable from what it had been.  In January, Leni, while still on location, had learned through local newspapers that Hitler had taken power, but not of the various university book burnings or anti-jew sentiments that had spread throughout Germany, due to the lack of newspaper coverage of such events.  Financially, Riefenstahl no real money, only liquid money, which Harry Sokal had promised her as her part of the final take for the films international draws.  After all, it was a success and she banked her future off the returns.  Although, Sokal was a Jew and when Hitler came to power, Sokal fled to France and cut all ties with Germany, including Riefenstahl and her money.  She was still content, focused, and worked arduously on what was to be her next project.  It was to be an international style spy-thriller that could finally allow Leni the chance to showcase her talents as an actress.  The film was a French and German production called Mademoiselle Docteur, with Fanck once again directing.  Leni took up with Gerhard Menzel to produce a script and production was set for mid-September at UFA Babelsberg.  Yet, her plans took a sinister turn for the unexpected in the last week of August 1933.  
	During that period, from Lenis return to Berlin in January till August, Dr Goebbels attention to Leni had become persistent and bothersome.  Although Leni took care of her personal life (she had to continuously thwart off both personal and professional advancements from Goebbels), her professional career was being overlooked and or manipulated by these powerful figures.  This all came to a head when Leni was invited to a luncheon at the Reich Chancellery.  There, Leni was informed by Hitler that she was to be involved in the production of a documentary for the 1933 Party Rally at Nuremberg.  However, this came as quite a shock to Leni, who herself knew nothing of the film or her involvement with it.  She vehemently declined on all grounds, artistic or otherwise.  Hitler played it off as a miscommunication with Goebbels, who was to directly inform Riefenstahl of the project.  When Leni returned home from the meeting with Hitler, she had found that UFA had cancelled pre-production on Mademoiselle.  She was devastated, angered, and depressed, by the fact she had all but lost complete artistic control and the lengths for which those people would go.  
	She had very little time in which to get to Nuremberg for the Party day shoot.  Although she was angry, she took the job thinking Goebbels would have arranged everything for her and the project.  When she arrived, nothing was in order.  Goebbels did absolutely nothing to assist in the production of her film, as was his job, which soon became his M.O.  Immediately she was on the phone with anyone able to help, just as in Das Blaue Licht.  She involved Albert Speer, the Party architect, rookie cameraman Walter Frentz, Sepp Algeier, and even her brother Heinz.  Again, AGFA supported her quickly with four thousand feet of film stock.  She had completed all the pre-production, yet when the Rally began she realized quickly that this was a failed attempt. No passes, permits, or sanctions were given to her, therefor at anytime during the shoot the S.A. or S.S. would force her crew to stop production.   When it came time to edit the film, she had no idea on how to arrange the film.  There was no plot or rules so she had "to create visual rhythm and variety" with her editing to make a cogent film.  Although what she felt she had created was worthless, the premiere of Sieg der Glaubens, on 1 December 1933, proved to be a success in the eyes of Reich leaders.  
	Riefenstahl felt her life was in ruins and a doctor prescribed her for Rest and Relaxation in the resort of Davos.  In the meantime, she felt that in order not to produce more of the style of films that the Nazis had wished she would produced, she offered up Walter Ruttmann, a known communist yet well respected documentary filmmaker, to take control of any future filming for the Nazis.  During her stay in Davos she had began to get involved in a film for Terra Films called Tiefland.  This opportunity came at seemingly the perfect time because she had wished to begin projects other then for the Party.  This film also granted her more of an artistic challenge then the earlier Fanck films because she was given most of the artistic and organizational control for the project.  In June, She began to scout locations in Spain with her friend Günther Rahn and also hired top actor Heinrich George for the lead role of the film.   Tragically, the production fell under as the crew and lights arrived days after the first day of scheduled shooting.  She could no longer keep the respected actor George any longer on the set without filming.  Leni was furious at the lack of orginzation and at once her health began to fail under the pressure.  While in the hotel she had suffered a circulatory collapse that put her in the hospital for weeks.  Terra, with news of the problems, backed out of the film and covered their losses, which meant that the film was completely scrapped.  Leni could do nothing but return and set the project on the back-burner.  Although she had wished to avoid the political-documentary style of filmmaking that the Party had wanted her to produced; she was soon back into a film deal once again for Hitler. This production was for the filming of the 1934 Reichstag rally that would become Triumph des Willens, which would ultimately her most controversial picture 
	Upon returning home in August of 1934, after the failure of Tiefland, she had gotten word that she was to be summoned by Hess to visit Hitler.  She felt the intentions of this summons were not good for her.  She had been told that Ruttmann was unsuitable and that Hitler demanded her as the filmmaker.  She quickly reviewed some footage for the prologue that her suggested filmmaker Walter Ruttmann had shot and was entirely unpleased.  Ruttmanns film, according to the September 12 German film journal Lichtbildbühne, was a Marxist "montage of various aspects of German history covering the twenty years preceding Hitlers ascent to power"(97).  Leni then quickly made her way to the town of Nuremberg to keep the meeting with Hitler.  She had tried to have Hitler release her from the filming, but was promised by Hitler complete artistic control for this film and future works, outside of Goebbels, if she would complete this film. She was distraught at the tactics but she reluctantly agreed to the filming, however under her own conditions.  She had asked that the production of the film would be put under her company (Leni Riefenstahl Studio Film) and not by the Ministry of Propaganda.  She was allowed two weeks of pre-production for the rally was to begin.  During the pre-production, she worked tirelessly day and night to find the cameramen, such as Walter Frentz, and her cinematographer Sepp Allgeier, along with others to make 18 total cameramen for the entire shoot.  She collected a crew of 172 persons.  
The Nuremberg Reichstag Party Rally, which took place in September 4-10, 1934, was to be "the official document, occurred at a momentous time in the history of the Nazi movement"(32).  Her approach to the shooting of the film was purely based on experimentally techniques that she felt would give a more aesthetic and dynamic look to an otherwise static film.  Leni used various stylistic tricks to produce a film that would be at least interesting to watch.  She had around 40,000 yards of film stock at her disposal. She also cloaked her cameramen in S.A. uniforms so they could acquire shots without looking out of place.  To achieve shots that would have otherwise been unattainable she used dollies and tracks, which provided active movement for her shots and a huge elevator platform in order to capture the grandeur and magnitude of the event.  Most of these ideas came at a spur of the moment, which attested to the fact that Leni had to create the film without the help of a script:  
I didnt write a single page of text for either Triumph of the Will or Olympia.  The moment I had a clear picture of the film in my head, the film was born.  The structure of the whole imposed itself.  It was purely intuitive.  Starting from that idea, I sent the technical crew out on different tasks, but the true establishment of the form began with the editing (34).
Lenis chief role while at the Rally was as coordinator to the crew and cameramen.  In fact, the directorialship of the film could be considered that of the 18 cameramen who where given free control by Leni to shoot what they felt was an important event.  Lenis role as editor of the film was her most challenging work with this project.  She noted that once underway with the editing that she had begun working 12, 14, and then 16 plus hours per day, while splicing the over 61 hours of film on a small Lytax editing station, which covered every imaginable angle of the event.  She told the B.B.C in 1972, the editing process for this film was "the most difficult work of [her] life"(101). While editing, she had a slight run-in with General von Reichenau, who had wanted a preview of the rushes to the Wehrmacht military exercises that he had wished were to be included in the film.  Leni had to tell him that the footage was completely useless due to weather conditions on the day of the shoot.  Enraged, General von Reichenau spoke to Hitler and convinced him to force Leni to add more to the film or to create a small supplementary addition to Triumph of the Will that showed the Wehrmacht event. Leni bended her demands for complete artistic control with the addition of a slice of the Wehrmacht in the 8th section of the Triumph of the Will.  Still, Generals like Blomberg were not pleased and Hitler realized he needed the Germany Army on his side.  Hitler relented and asked Leni instead to put the Army leaders in the film as background to the title of the film.  Leni was shocked at the demand and declined.  Her distressing reactions prompted a response from Hitler that struck fear into her.  She sensed that fear and then said she would create another film for the following years Wehrmacht.  The resulting 15-minute film, shot entirely in one day with a small crew, was Tag der Freiheit (Day of Freedom). 
	The only other difficultly Leni found with the editing process was in the sound of the film. The sound was harder to manage because her cameramen used various speeds of film from 18fps to 24fps (frames per second).  Dubbing and syncing the film proved to be quite a task for Leni. She attests that absolutely none of the actual film was created in the studio, only sound effects and post-production work. However, this is a debatable topic because other accounts exist by Herr Speer that states even speeches were re-filmed due to technical errors during the filming. In his book Inside the Third Reich, Albert Speer stressed that Leni "thought the reconstructed scenes was better then the original"(100). She only attested to having some of the crowd sounds produced in the studio in order to make the film more presentable.  Herbert Windt did the score to the film and it exhibited his flare for the Wagnerian tradition.  At one point of the film, during the parade (scene 11), Leni herself conduced the score in order to have the tempo of the images align with the pace of the music.    
	On March 28, 1935, after over five months of intensive editing, the premiere of Triumph des Willens was at hand.  Just hours before the film was to be premiered, Leni and her crew was still finish the prints back in the editing room going over the last details.  Absolutely no one had seen the film before the showing, not even the German censorship board.  Riefenstahl rushed to change into a white-fur coat and made her way into The Ufa-Palace for the premiere. Although she was quite nervous, those thoughts were quelled when a joyful response was produced in the theater.  At the end of the film, Leni took several ovations for her film and it was said that even Hitler presented her with a bouquet of flowers for her work.  On May 1, 1935, Goebbels awarded the National Film Prize to Riefenstahl for her film with the following accolade:
This film represents an exceptional achievement in the film production of the past year.  It is closely relevant to us because it reflects the present: is describes in unprecedented scenes the gripping events of our political existence.  It is a filmed grand vision of our Führer, who is shown here for the first time on the screen in the most impressive manner.  The film has successfully overcome the danger of becoming a mere propaganda feature.
	The five months of full-time editing had again exhausted Leni until she was literally unrecognizable.  She went to Davos to recuperate her health.  At the time, even Hitler had noticed how frail and ill she appeared.  It was while in Davos, she had come to learn that her romantic relationship with Walter Prager had ended due to his affairs during her busy scheduling.  
	For her next project, Leni knew that she had wished to return to acting. She knew of a project, Penthesilea, that had been lurking on the backburner for years but felt at that time the she was not willing to commit to such a gigantic film project.  Yet, in order to return to the screen she had to get back into shape and did so by doing track and field at the Grunewald athletic stadium.  During this period, she came into contact with Professor Carl Diem, secretary general of the organization committee of the Eleventh Olympic Games, which were to take place just less then a year.  He had seen her films and was particularly struck with her ability and therefor offered her the chance to make a film documenting the events of the Games.  Although she had sworn never to do another documentary after her previous film, she found the idea most inciting because no such attempt at filming the games with any artistic or aesthetic merit had been done.  Still she had her doubts about the project because she had no possible conception on how to create the film.  She questioned Dr. Fanck on the issue of the project and he saw three possibilities. 
It could be a full-length film aiming purely at aesthetic and artistic effects  an impression of movements and elements of various sports.  However, this approach would have no documentary value, since two hours wouldnt be enough to cover even the most important events.  It would be the most useless solution.  Another possibility might be six mammoth films.  And the third solution, which [he] considered the most suitable would be proper reportage, with no artistic status, to be shown in cinemas within six days of the end of the games; at best this would provide above-average newsreels(170).
  Riefenstahl felt just the same as Fanck and had almost backed out of signing; until she began to visualize a film that blended the ancient aesthetic with the modern games.  After talking over her ideas with Otto Meyer, the chancellor of the International Olympic Committee, she felt confident that the project could go ahead and she signed.  Plus they had offered her complete artistic control away from conforming to any ideology or political message.  She approached UFA to produce, but they declined on the grounds that they didnt understand her concept of the film.  It was certainly an unusual film for the time.  The other major Production company in Berlin, Tobis, with its head Friedrich Mainz, was pleased to produce the film in conjunction with Leni Riefenstahl Productions under the joint name of Olympia Films.  They agreed to cover within two films most of the important events of the summer games. 
Before the production of the games began, Leni was offered an invitation to Italy to visit Mussolini.  When she arrived, Mussolini praised her work on Triumph des Willens and offered her the opportunity to direct a political-docu-drama.  She respectfully declined due to her long production with Olympia and left Italy with only a message of solidarity for Hitler from Mussolini.  Upon returning, she had given the message to Hitler and then was questioned by various members of the party on the nature of her travel to Italy.
During the weeks of late January and February 1936, she and her crew of cameramen began to run tests on various types of stocks and brands to create the perfect image for each of the landscapes, close-ups, and action sequences.  In May, they began to test out how to stylize the filming of the most diverse athletic events.  Once again, she worked 16-hour days during the filming and carried on daily meetings with her cameramen trying to influence their cameras to portray the aesthetic of the games.  During the pre-production period, Leni found out that Goebbels had allowed another crew to film the games in order to create a quicker "more newsreel style" film.  In a meeting with Leni, Goebbels found it laughable that she would attempt to make such a film when he felt the publics attention of the games would only last just weeks after they had ended.  Still, she worked hard with her crew coming up with new techniques to film the games: hot-air-balloons, airplanes, motorboats, underwater cameras (a first), soundproof cameras, and various tracks and dollies.  
Although much of the pre-production red tape was bothersome, Leni found the most difficulties in trying to find suitable locations to place her cameras.  Several terms and agreements on the locations were made and then quickly changed by the IOC.  Even as the games were underway, the officials had a hard time allowing Leni access to the athletes.  On one occasion during the hammer throw event she had positioned her cameras right around the athletes cage, but when one unknowing official discovered her cameraman the official pushed her camera out of the way.  Leni, in a blind rage, pushed aside the Olympic judge and then exchanged a few choice words.  Goebbels, once hearing of the event, almost ejected her off the premises for the remainder of the games.  Yet composure was quickly restored as apologies were exchanged.  
Meanwhile, she had hoped to use the various pits inside the stadium to shoot from, because it offered the best aesthetic value to any given event.  She fought tirelessly with the IOC to gain access to the various field pits.  For one, it was the only thing that would give her the ability to shoot the athletes with any sort of usable background.  From inside the pits the cameras could be positioned low to produce a high-angle shoot, which avoided various distractions like poles, crowds, and allowed the athletes to be juxtaposed with the sky, which was her signature shot.  Leni was granted six locations: "one pit each at the high jump, broad jump, and pole vault, one pit five yards away from the hundred-metre starting line, one at the side of the finishing line, and one next to the triple jump plus two towers at the center of the stadium, one tower behind the starting line of the hundred-metre track"(187).  She had received a little of what she had wished for and then was quickly driven to Athens to begin the filming as the Olympic Torch was lit and run back to Berlin.  While in Athens, she enlisted director Willy Zielke, who was most noted for his work Das Stahltier(1935) but would later enter a mental hospital, was placed in charge of the production and filming of the prologue.  When she reviewed the work that Zielke shot in Athens, she felt it needed more of the classical aesthetic and so she shot and added segments of nude figures that were modeled after the classical Greek model.
On August 1, 1936, the 11th Olympic Games in Berlin began with a grand opening ceremony.  Events of the day, for which Riefenstahl employed a sum of sixty photographers to capture, included: the entrance of the nations, the arrival of the torch bearer, the lighting of the fire, and Hitlers opening remarks, which was complemented with the release of hundreds of doves.  Once again, the shooting was relatively straightforward until Goebbels became involved and put pressure on Leni to change her approach to shooting.  Leni had wished to place her sound cameras near the rostrum, where most of the foreign diplomats were located, including Hitler and Goebbels. However, Goebbels felt that her location would prove to block the view so he verbally reprimanded her while in the company of the members of the rostrum.  However, Riefenstahl didnt retreat because she had gained the Führers select permission and Goebbels complaints fell on deaf ears.
Once the prologue and opening ceremonies had been completed (nearly 1,900 feet of film stock), Leni spent the remainder of the games personally looking over select major events, such as track and field.  Stars of track and field, like the famed Jesse Owens, were well documented in the filming as he took four gold metals and two world records at the games.  During this period, she had become romantically involved with Glenn Morris, who was an American and decathlon gold medallist.  Yet, the affair soon ended as he left Berlin directly after the games.
Shooting the events presented a challenge in its own right, but the massive amount of stock used needed to be reviewed before even the editing process could begin.  The project took Leni eighteen months to select and edit her vision of Olympia; and in that time, Germanys political and social landscape had drastically grown worse.  Events like the extension of the Enabling Act, the Rome-Berlin axis establishment, and various political and military ousting had taken place.  Yet, Leni once again had literally barricaded herself in Geyers glass walled editing suites and in doing so avoided much of the developments occurring outside. This could attest to the ongoing political naivety she had, as she explained to Film Culture in 1973, the work was her world: "Really, if I start to work I forget food, I forget that I am a woman, I forget my dress, I only see my work.  I forget because I am fascinated by my work". Over 300,000 meters of stock had been used to cover the events, yet only 20,000 could be considered for editing and then just 6,151 meters to complete the film.  From the beginning the film had been envisioned as two films:  The first film was titled Fest der Völker and the second Fest der Schönheit.  Just a year after the opening ceremony, Leni had completed the editing of the first film.  After a brief holiday, she had quickly wrapped the second and began scoring the work with the Berlin Symphony in January of 1938.  The premiere was scheduled to occur in March of that year but had been pushed back by Tobis, who were by now under complete control by Goebbels and his office.  The premiere of Olympia took place at the UFA Palast am Zoo on April 20, 1938, on Hitlers birthday.
The critical and public reaction to Olympia was deeply reactionary to the time of its release.  Most critics of the day were not able to separate the political element of the times away from the spirit of the films, however some had favorable comments to give.  Meanwhile, Leni found herself heavily involved in premiering the film various European cities: Paris, Oslo, Rome, Venice, etc.  Along with the travel came the numerous awards for her film including: German National Prize issued by Goebbels, Grand Prize in Paris, Polar Prize in Sweden, and the Mussolini Cup (aka First Prize  Venice Biennale.).  However, her 1938 trip to America proved to be the most fiery attack, not only on her, but on the state of Germany.  She was relentlessly questioned as to if she was Hitlers girlfriend or if she had information on the anti-Semitism taking place in German cities.  Her journey took her across the states from New York City to Hollywood and although she had to deal with the assaults of Anti-Nazi protest, she was able to find favor with some celebrities such as Walt Disney.  Yet, for the most part, Hollywoods reaction could be summed up with one of their headlines: "There is no place in Hollywood for Leni Riefenstahl".  
After returned to Europe, Leni focused her attention on the development of Penthesilea, the film she had wished to create years previous.  She started Leni Riefenstahl Films Inc. for the development this particular film.  To prepare for the filming, in which Leni would play the role of an Amazon Queen, she required horseback training and also needed to prepare a script.  She retreated to the island of Sylt with her mother, trainer, and her horse named Maerchen to begin work on her dream project.  She got the famed director Jürgen Fehling to sign on the project as director of the acting scenes.  Pre-production on the film had been flawless until everything fell apart when Leni received a call: War had been declared as Germany had swept into Poland.
In order to be of some use to the war effort Leni and her colleges had drafted a proposal to shoot newsreel footage from the combat front.  Although Leni was hesitant at the idea she soon got word from the Wehrmacht that the project had been approved.  She and her crew traveled directly up to the front lines in the small Polish town of Konskie where they were to meet General von Reichenau.  In a brief meeting he told the crew to maintain a close distance to the Wehrmacht due to the movement of the lines.  One night while Leni was in a tent and her crew in cars sleeping, bullets began to fly into their camp.  The Germany army had captured several Polish solders and in a brief flurry of gunfire the attack was quickly quelled.  When the Polish solders were brutally handled and shot by some lower ranking German solders Leni became angry and confronted the solders.  The German solder nearly shot her on the spot.   Key photos of the event would later haunt Lenis role in the affair and prove to be damaging in her later film career. She reported the incident to General von Reichenau and asked to be released from the frontline work.  He regretfully agreed by promising her a court-martial against the solders involved. 
When she returned to Berlin in spring of 1940, she read in Film-Kurier that Tobis was once again trying to begin a production of Tiefland, the film they had both abandoned just four years prior.  Leni jumped at the opportunity only when she felt that Penthesileaﾕs budget would be unavailable to such a film during wartime Germany.  They signed a deal for Leni to direct the film and she began work on the film that would not have its premiere proper until fifteen years later.  She had in mind the locations from the original shoot in Spain and then bunkered herself in a snowy cottage in Kitzbühel to begin writing the script.  The script wasnt a challenge with the assistance of Harald Rienl, a skier who helped her work out the dialogue of the script.  Just six weeks later, the script was complete and she began to look for a cast and crew to bring the story to the screen.  Leni knew specifically what she had in mind when she wanted to cast the character of Pedro.  She found her actor on the ski-slopes of St. Anton and knew that that face, full of quirky and bashful expressions, was Pedro.  However, Franz Eichberger was a non-professional and quite inept at taking direction.  Still, Riefenstahl saw something in the screen test to warrant him as the lead.  For the role of Martha, the Spanish dancer, it seemed to be the job Riefenstahl was exactly suited for.  Yet, she had not wished to take on the dual roles of both director and actor due to the amount of undue stress it took on her but seeing no other option she found this to be the only way she envisioned the film.  In order to cope with the stress she began to look for an additional director that would help her shoot the acting scenes for the film.  Leni looked into various key directorial names such as Will Forst, Helmut Kaeutner, Viet Harlan, and even Fanck, but all were booked.  Luckily, an old friend G.W. Pabst had returned to Berlin and Leni signed him onto the film as second director in charge of select acting scenes. 
However, before any shooting could begin in Spain, Hitler had moved the war to the western front of Europe on May 10, 1940, which subsequently blocked Leni from further production.  Then Goebbels had propositioned Pabst to create two films under his department, so Pabst left the Tiefland set to further pursue his career.  She then got the help of Pabsts assistant and noted stage director, Mathias Wieman, who was hired quickly for the job.   The Nazis Blitzkrieg provided victories that spread throughout east and west Europe.  Within days they had conquered Holland, Belgium, and then France.  Mussolini then declared Italy at war with France, which by then was a mute point.  With the war moving westward, Leni and her crew were forced to return to Berlin to avoid conflicts during shooting.  She had planned on moving the set to the familiar Dolomites, where she had made many of her earlier films.
Filming took place for three weeks in the Dolomites while her sets for the village where being constructed in Krün.  The script had called for a wolf, but Lenis staff had no luck of finding a tamed wolf.  By chance she had found one tamed wolf in Berlin but while during the shooting in the mountains the wolf died.  Still, that was the least of her problems as the summer was quickly fading from the mountains; and Leni knew that they were not going to be able to finish the shooting that summer.  This winter delay presented terrible scheduling difficulties, along with set storage problems and the overall cost of delay.  A brutally expensive halt to production was made so they could resume shooting the following spring.  During the break, Leni had to replace Minetti, who was to be a rider in the film, with another man able to ride.  The man cast for the role, who was a first lieutenant in the mountain infantry, quickly fell for Leni.  A romantic quickly blossomed after a rather rocky start, but then First Lieutenant Peter Jacob was called back to the war front.  Leni was terribly miserable and became ill with colic, an infection of bladder. 
She became so ill on the set that she returned to Berlin to seek medical help.  Although she had suffered from this issue in the past, such as during her filming with Fanck, she was now not able to find an easy cure.  Still, while Leni was ill, Waldi Traut, her executive producer, had got a studio in Babelsberg so they could resume shooting immediately.  Leni struggled to finish even takes and she soon found herself at Josephinum, private clinic in Munich.  Her condition grew worse as she stopped eating and lost weight so a friend suggested acupuncture as a cure. Leni was doubtful but tried it.  After the first consolation Leni noticed how well the homeopathic therapy had helped take away the severe pain.  After continual visits, she suffered no longer and was able to return to the set.
While sick, Leni got word that a soundstage been selected for her sets and Pabst had returned after he had completed his work with Goebbels ministry.  Leni began to rehearse her scenes as the Spanish dancer with Harald Kreutzberg.  Once on the set, she felt that Pabst direct was lacking as his "approach was a routine more consistent with run-of-the-mill commercial movies"(273).  The tension this caused between Leni and Pabst while acting drove her to take him off the film and he went to make another film for Goebbels.  Arthur Maria Rabenalt quickly took Pabst position but it wasnt timely due to another stoppage of production.  In that winter between shooting, Leni found that her dear friend Colonel General Ernst Udet, the ace pilot of the Fanck films, had committed suicide.  She then committed most of her time protecting herself in her house while booming air raids continued to rain down on Berlin and her only sense of hope was the daily mail from her beloved Peter.
Production restarted on Tiefland had Leni had begun to shoot many of the more difficult scenes of the film including: Pedro killing the wolf by strangulation and the wolfs attack on the sheep.  The later shot required an explosives blaster so the animals would be alarmed by the presence of the wolf.  While setting up the shot, one member of her crew was doing prep work in the blasting range as an explosive went off that killed him within seconds.  Production was once again halted for days.  During the pause, Peter and Lenis relationship had developed into love.  His relentless letters had transfixed Leni on the character of Peter and when he came to visit the set during the break he slipped a gold ring on her finger and asked her hand in marriage.  Peter then left once again for the bloody and cold eastern front and Leni returned to Berlin while the film was on recess for nine months.
On March 1, 1943 Lenis house in Berlin suffered a massive air raid attack, which set her entire street in flames.  Leni had to retreat from the war on her doorstep and escaped to Kitzbühel with the aid of Speer.  For one particular shot, Leni and the crew flew back to Spain in the mist of war.  They had to capture the difficult bull-fighting scene that took them to the location of Salamanca.  Yet, the production was now years overdue and even more over budget.  Producers Traut and Grosskopf visited Martian Boorman, right hand to Hitler, in order to receive more finances for the film.  They received the money without question.  Hitler had seemed to keep some of his promise to Leni and not allowed Goebbels to interfere with the production.  The shot was made and the crew returned to bombed out Berlin.  Goebbels suggested that all important firms should move out of Berlin due to the war, so Leni moved her production up to Kitzbühels Seebichl House to resume sound-mixing and editing.  The production was almost nearing its long-awaited end.
On March 21, 1944, Leni and Peter were joined in marriage by a magistrate in Kitzbühel.  Her parents were present but not her brother Heinz, who was still fighting in the east.  On March 30, Leni traveled to visit Hitler, who had given her a note of congratulations on her marriage.  Leni explained that most of her meetings with Hitler were just his "monologues" on various subjects of the day and she was lucky to get a word into the conversation.  In July, Lenis father had passed away at the age of sixty-five.  Just days later, she had discovered that her brother had been killed by a grenade in Russia.  He was just 38 years old.  The news of both deaths had struck Leni very hard, especially her brother.  Leni felt she had the chance to get her brother out of the war if she would have only approached Hitler on the subject earlier.
In October of 1944, the production moved to Prague for the final shots of Tiefland.  These interior shots were some of the most costly and challenging in the film due to the sets, but they wrapped the film within days.  Peter, meanwhile, had been selected to fight in Italy and had suffered an attack of rheumatism, which made it impossible for him to continue writing Leni.  In a panic from not hearing from him she left the production and traveled to Italy in an attempt to find him.  After various leads she found Peter stricken with rheumatism and lying in a hospital bed. Once he had received treatment and returned to health he was ordered to Berlin and Leni went back to her editing studio to continue work on Tiefland.  By this time in early 1945 Leni and everyone else knew that the war was now closing in on Berlin and would soon end.  Leni felt that her film had taken much the same road and coincided with the war in Germany had taken.  By the end of the war all Leni could do was to work feverishly mixing the film for its final edit.  Sound was the only element left out and because many of the scenes were outdoor locations this made post-dub quite an expensive and tedious task.  With the war increasing pressure on Germany, she had to hold off finishing the project once more.
Early in 1945, Leni had the chance to save important documents before the war had ended by shipping them to Bozano.  Leni gathered some documents and "prepared three metal boxes containing the original negatives of the two Party rally films, Victory of Faith and Triumph of the Will, as well as the Wehrmacht short Day of Freedomﾓ(302).  Leni found out later that the contents of the boxes had made it to Bolzano but they were quickly "lost".  The Americans had no lucky finding the negatives and to this day they remain unanswered for. 
Riefenstahl received a call from Hans Schneeberger, her former lover who needed her help because his life was in danger.  Leni arrived in Mayorhofen and quickly arranged to help Schneeberger and his wife, who herself was in jail for speaking out against Hitler during the last period of the war.  She tried to make her way back to her mother by hitchhiking along with a group of men because of no other means of travel.  While on the trip, American troops had come into the region and found Leni traveling home.  They soon checked Lenis I.D. and papers, for which she was quickly sent to a holding camp just miles away.  She escaped from this camp with ease and many other camps due to begin caught repeatedly but finally made it back to her home via bicycle.  When she had arrived, American troops had seized the home for a base.  There she had been told by an officer that her family had been relocated and that Peter was also alive and with them.  She was shocked at both the news and how well the Americans had treated her.  She raced to meet her family and the time they spent was sweet but very short as they were under house arrest.  
The situation dramatically changed when Leni was separated from Peter and taken to an American camp.  There she was encamped with top Nazi officials and then found out about the outrageous crimes against humanity that took place in the concentration camps.  Riefenstahl had quickly realized during an interrogation that the American forces had kept detailed records of her relationship to the Party and to Hitler.  After a brief medical evaluation she was found fit and cleared to leave the camp on her own recognizance.
After a month of freedom the American troops changed power over to the French who wanted more questions from Leni.  They took her into house arrest in Innsbruck and notified her that she needed to leave French territory in 24 hours.  Then, at the most critical moment, she suffered another colic attack and was brought to the hospital while the clock continued to tick.  In the hospital the French had forced her to give up the only print known to exist of Zielkes film Das Stahltier.  Leni quickly took medication and returned to Kitzbühel to pack with only hours left to leave.  Peter had arrived and they packed the bare essentials.  The ended up having to leave her unfinished Tiefland project.  During the escape they were once again stopped and sent to a harsher prison in Innsbruck.  Leni suffered in solitary cell for a month and was only allowed to talk with her doctor due to the infection.  She was released to house arrest in order to finish Tiefland but the French soon made her leave everything behind to be relocated to another French Zone city.  She picked Freiberg because Fanck lived there. She called him and he wished nothing to do with her. The French placed them in Breisach, one of Germanys most bombed out cities.  While there, Leni and Peters relationship became strained due to her illness and arrests.  
In August of 1946, Leni was transferred to a post in Baden-Baden where she was interrogated.  Then after weeks there she was shipped to Königsfeld in the Schwarzewald with her husband and live-in secretary Hanni Isele.  Leni felt a sense of freedom here but the poverty was difficult.  She learned that the French had taken all her film equipment for the Tiefland editing and shipped them to Paris and also drained all her and her familys bank assets.  Meanwhile, the tension between Leni and Peter caused her to leave the relationship just after 3 years of marriage.  
In 1947, Leni had arranged a deal with Monsieur Desmarais, an independent producer in France, for her films to be distributed through his company.  They made negotiations in private and he offered to split the profits 50\50.  He also helped Leni file documents for the French government for her freedom.  In early 1948, Leni received documentation that the French government had made her a free woman.  
 Leni then found out that Luis Trenker had procured a supposed copy of Eva Brauns diary and had begun to publish it.  The book caused a sensation due to its graphic details on Hitlers inner-life because Braun was Hitlers companion during the war years.  The Braun family had filed suit against the publishing house and Leni soon became co-plaintiff.  The case was handled swiftly due to the book being a complete forgery.  This court-battle was the beginning of the long Denazifcation process, which found Leni it courts for years to come.
	Within a year Leni had won unanimous victories in her denazification trials.  In the July 1949 trial, Leni was forced to defend herself in front of a court and again the evidence was overwhelming that she was never associated or involved with the National Socialists.  Her court battles continued with personal attacks against her.  In November of 1949, Leni sued the Munich magazine Revue due to an image published that made the statement that Leni had used slave labor from concentration camps in her still uncompleted film Tiefland.  The prosecutions case soon crumbled under mountains of evidence and personal witness, including several Gypsies that worked with the film.  
	Life, now in 1949, was relevantly calm and mundane in relation to the rest of her life.  She lived in Munich and got job offers for another Olympic film but declined due the fact that she could not make another comparable film like Olympia.  Harry Sokal, who had taken her money and the negatives to Das Blaue Licht, returned to Leni in Munich and asked her to help her distribute a skiing film they had done together years ago.  She set Sokal up with Union films and they struck a deal but Leni received nothing.  Luck came to her door when Friedrich Mainz, head of Tobis, visited her and was shocked at the living quarters.  He then wrote her a check for the sum of 10,000 marks, which she used to move into an apartment in Schwabing.  
	In June of 1950, Leni and her assistant Frau Peters had the opportunity to examine film-stock in Berlin-Schönefeld.  All her films had been save in duplicate negative form throughout the war.  However, just years later the bunker with the negatives had been entirely cleared out and Leni had no possessions from her prior filmmaking.  In October of 1950, Leni traveled to Rome with the intention of beginning a new film: Red Devils.  Leni signed a deal with Capital Pictures and she began work on pre-production in Cortina dAmpezzo in the Dolomites.  Then another offer came up for Leni while she stayed lavishly in Italy.  After meeting with directors such as Vittorio de Sica and Roberto Rossellini she got the chance to reedit a version of Das Blaue Licht due to the help of Dr. Arnold, the inventor of the Arriflex camera.  Once the editing was finish in Thieresee with the help of UFA conductor Dr. Giuseppe Becca, the film was distributed to Iris film sand was Riefenstahls first German-Italian co-production.  The word spread of the re-edit and various former associates had traveled to see Leni demanding money for the film.  Both Sokal and Schneeberg approached Leni but their claims were unwarranted as they both owed her large amounts of cash, all of which Riefenstahl claims is documented.  Nevertheless, Das Blaue Licht new re-edit premiered in major cities throughout Germany and Italy to great reviews.  
	Production was to proceed on Red Devils directly after the mini-tour of her new re-edit, however Revue ran another article with a photo of Riefenstahl at the scene of a bloodbath in Poland at the start of the war.  The text manipulated the event to suggest that Leni was involved in some way for the deaths of the Polish solders.  A tabloid in France ran a similar article on the photo and Leni was approached by her Red Devil backers, who wished out of the contract due to the bad press associated with her.  Along with this bad news came word from France, who was now willing to transfer the Tiefland material to the Austrian embassy on May 9, 1952, had now rescinded that offer.  Riefenstahl sought to clear up the issue of Konskie once and for all with another denazification trial that proved once again that the Revue article was false and Leni played no role in the events.  She quickly filed suit against Revue with the trail as evidence.  
	Back in Rome, she had the chance to begin negotiations to pick up her film once again.  She met with Herr Tischendorf at Herzog studios and suggested the film was to be a success with male lead Jean Marais and Vittorio de Sica, who met her in Rome and were willing and excited to play roles in the film.  She also had a vote of confidence from her new friend Jean Cocteau, the famed and multi-talented artist.  She got the deal and in six-weeks the film was to begin shooting.  
	Meanwhile, Leni received notice that Tiefland, which was under the control of the French government, had been transported to Vienna.  Leni was shocked due to the fact that she had heard that prints were to be destroyed.  While on a train with Dr. Kamitz, head of the affairs that dealt with the German prosperity issue after the war, they spoke over the touchy issue with Tiefland.  Dr. Kamitz had explained to her that the film became involved in the political realm.  Leni was joyful to find that their was a chance to save her film:
The confiscation also countermanded the orders of the French occupation forces and film officers, who were directly under the Surete, hand been the ones who also had illegally withdrawn the money from our accounts and taken my private belongings to Paris.  This had to be hushed up in order to prevent a scandal in France and so I had been deprived of my freedomFirst, the French film officers tried to use Tiefland to their own ends.  For a year, they edited and reedited my material and it was only when the international legal situation made copyright infringement too ticklish for them that they gave up their plans (392).
Leni had now arranged to met with Dr. Kamitz and settle the Tiefland debacle.  Leni arrived in Vienna and presented documents stating that she was the soul owner of the film and not the Nazi Party, like the French once believed.  Leni finally got the chance to review the film after eight years without touching it.  Along with this production, Leni found that the boxes also included in the delivery had negatives for Olympia and some other mountain films.  Leni had been warned that the French tried to develop the film themselves and that project had proven unsuccessful.  When she finally was able to review the entire contents of the boxes she found much of the film had been tampered with.  One third of the negative prints were missing and the storage process the French used damaged the strips of film.  She also found that the main editing reel, to which she had made her first edits on, had vanished.  She traveled to Paris and searched the catacombs of film stocks that had been held in captive over the war years, however nothing came of her searches.  Meanwhile, back in Berlin, Allianz film had offered select distribution rights to the film.  Leni had no other choice now then to save face and edit the film with what stock she had in her possession.  She noted that some missing stocks held important scenes that effected the plot abnormally such as "the drought footage that had been shot in Spain"(396).  
	At long last the film Leni had wished to make from 1932 had presented itself in February of 1954, at its gala premiere in Stuttgarts E.M. Theatre.  Cocteau wrote to Leni suggesting that the Film be placed in Cannes Film Festival due to the success it was having on its premiere tour across Germany.  He offered her film to the board for entry and it was not accepted into competition but shown outside of the festival.  Cocteau even provided the French subtitles for the film and retold to Leni the success of the film abroad.  
	Coming off of Tieflandﾕs majority success, Leni looked to begin her other big project: The Red Devils.  She had the promises of key actors and the permits had been signed, and the finances were almost finished when the film fell through due to another political media debacle. The Communist paper in Vienna called Der Abend published a headline that read: "Leni Riefenstahl and the Taxpayer.  The Ministries of Finance and Commerce to Back Extravagant Film Project by the German Director".  Leni protested that their claims were a "bare-faced lie"(402) because her investors had all been verified.  However, the political wave grew and grew against Leni that it forced her investors to back out on account of the pressure they were receiving in light of the media.  
	Leni, from this point on, faced insurmountable political protest that shut down any advancement that she had wished to make with films.  She started other projects that never really began such as: Ewige Gipfel (1954), Drei Sterne am Mantel der Madonna, Sol y Sombra, and Tanz mit dem Tod (all in 1955).  Sadly, her most bankable film never to be made was a treatment she created with Jean Cocteau titled "Friedrich und Voltaire", which had Cocteau playing both historical roles.  They both felt that the film would examine and come to symbolize the roles of Germany and France and their love-hate relationship with one and other.  However,  Cocteau, by the 1960s, had become very ill and in 1963 he died   
	Leni had struggled with a story that she would be able to create.  She had bought Ernst Hemingways new novel The Green Hills of Africa and had become absolutely engrossed in the subject of Africa, like he had with Hitler and the mountains prior.  She loved the manner to which Hemingway visually wrote about the moody and dark landscape of Africa.  She promised herself that she would see this land, and it had been a mysterious passion of hers to this very day.  She began to look into other areas that had the subject of Africa and came upon Hassans Black Freight, which lead to her development of a treatment she titled Schwarze Fracht.  She tried to shop the work to various buyers but nothing came about due to their concerns and artistic demands, to which Leni would never give up.  She came about a tentative deal with Gloria and had the assistance once again of Waldi Traut, who helped her financially and artistically in the negotiations.  In April of 1956, Leni flew to Nairobi in order to begin to find suitable locations her script to take place.  She and her assistances looked in northeastern Kenya one day for various locations to shoot the majestic land. Yet before they found anything suitable their Land Rover truck had swerved in the road to avoid animals and the truck hit a stone marker to the bridge that made their truck violently leap into the air and tumble over. The passengers were in serious condition while the truck began to start afire.  Leni passed out due to broken ribs, a collapsed lung, and a severe head injury that could have ultimately proved to be fatal while her passengers also had broken bones and blood running everywhere.  By luck, a passing British convoy sent to check on the bridge once a month had seen the event and rescued them.  They were soon dropped off at a medic and received only minor treatment.  They were soon transferred to a hospital back in Nairobi.  Leni was almost considered dead, but the English doctors continued to work on her injuries.  Leni had come out of her coma and over the course of weeks began to hear her wounds.  During her stay in the hospital she finished writing the script.  Once healthy, Leni began to find more locations for her film and actors.  The lead was to be a woman although Leni felt she miscast herself in Tiefland so she avoided working in front of the camera for this film.  
Just as things were coming into place the film hit its tragic end when they began test shooting.  The weather conditions and actors (natives) were non-cooperative for the shoots and in the fall of 1956 the Suez war developed, which halted all movement for Lenis crew and equipment.  Then the rainy season came, which destroyed much of the ideal landscape Leni had in mind to shoot.  She then received word that Traut and his wife had ended up in an auto crash while in the Alps.  She was told they were not expected to make it out alive.  She rushed from Africa to Innsbruck to visit and found that Waldi was seriously injured but would soon recover from the crash.  The events ultimately shook Leni and the backers, so the filming was called off.  
 Much of the 1960s were spent building up film projects that had no future.  In early 1960, she had visited London for a studio that wished to create a new colorized version of Das Blaue Licht, but the ideas conflicted and the idea was halted.  However, her passions for Africa remained very strong even though they didnt involve making films.  She had new ideas for Africa that saw her stretching herself artistically because she "was seeking in Africa was something far more then the romanticized version presented in Hemingways writing.  She was looking for a total escape from the pressures of civilization, with its noisy and building cities, scandal-seeking newspapers, and corruption"(Hinton. p131).  In late 1962 she returned to Africa with a new mission to find and document the Nuba, an ancient and largely undocumented tribe.  She had become interested in the tribe when she saw one single photo of two natives wrestlers that seem the perfection of male psychical stature.  One man was carrying another man atop his shoulders.  When she had arrived in Africa with a team of scientist from Nasen she had only a lead that the Nuba were in a region called Kordofan.  She went there and by chance saw a man on the hillside that looked the part.  She followed them up the mountain and saw the Nuba for the first time huddled into a circle watch a festival of wrestling.  
	By October of 1962, when Riefenstahl had arrived with the Nuba she had just turned 60 years old.  She would go onto remain with the Nuba on this adventure for six months while trying to go friendships with them and learn their culture and language.  The children and mothers of the tribe especially took to Leni and helped her build up a strong vocabulary.  She traveled and documented with photos rituals that only occur for curtain tribes every 5-6 years.  For her first trip she ended up shooting over 200 rolls of film and began to document the more detailed aspects of the cultures she encountered in a journal. The six months spent with the Nuba and other tribes, traveling, eating, praying, etc went very quickly and she had to return back with her team from Nasen.   
	Riefenstahls passion drove to her begin to document the Nuba out of fear that the western world civilization was beginning to find its way into the Nubas sphere.  After she returned to Germany she was contacted by Richard Gardner, an American filmmaker, who had created two prize-winning films while in the bushes of the Sudan.  He convinced her to travel to Boston and they would plan to document with 16mm color film the Nuba.  When she arrived she was welcomed at Harvard and showed her slides of her first expedition.  Gardner had acquired a backer in Odyssey Productions out of New York, which fronted the money and split the profits. 
	Leni quickly traveled back to the Sudan and captured the Nuba.  Meanwhile, she began to enter her still photos from the first trip into scholarly magazines.  German newspapers used her photos to keep the world up to date on the various political and social doings in Africa.  Quickly word grew in circles and Leni had begun to get proposition for work in magazines such as Modern Photography.  In February, they began to use the 16mm cameras and began filming.  Leni was fortunate to capture sacred and private rituals such as the Nuba adolescent initiation.  While filming another wrestling festival Leni and her cameraman Leica got to close to the action and the wrestlers tumbled onto Leni, which crushing her ribs and sent her to the hospital.  While in Tadoro in January, Leni received word that her mother had entered into a hospital due to a blocked artery in her knee.  On the 18th, while Leni tried in vain to travel back to her mother, she got a telegram that read: "Mother died last night, await letter. Uli".  She quickly flew to Munich but her mother was buried and her only resolve was to turn back to the Nuba for the remainder of the shoot.    
	Once filming was done with the Nuba her crew returned to Munich to begin the post-production efforts.  She was told by Odyssey Productions that if her film was a success that they would offer her a deal that consisted of at least three motion pictures in Cinemascope.  Leni awaited the first batch of negatives to arrive from the Geyer lab.  When she reviewed the prints wept in tears because the color output was undesirable.  The ER green stock and cause a color conflict with the fur trees that surrounded the Nuba.  Many of the shots were lost due to the horrid green glare that ruined priceless moments.  Odyssey demanded the prints due to the fact that initial advertising had begun.  Leni would not give up her stock even though they were ruined.  She asked friends to acquire money and they annulled the contract.  
	Leni had begun to sell her pictures to various German magazines in order to gain an income.  She also began to get worried as her health decreased about her future so she thought about selling much of her film rights as a way of storing money for the future.  Meanwhile, London had become interested in what reels Leni had and wished to see the footage of the wrestlers.  She edited what she had and then sent the print to Geyer so they could balance the color problem.  When she received the prints back the picture was fine but someone had reedited the film.  She cancelled her trip and subsequent deal with backers in London due to this unforeseen event. 
	In the fall of 1967, Leni felt that her only happiness was with the Nuba.  She began to develop a new expedition and started by looking for a crew.  She needed a versatile man who could do multi-tasking: camera and repairs.  All inquires for such an artist was sadly laughable, until someone overheard her wishes.  A camera store clerk gave her the name of a Horst Kettner who was both an assistant director and mechanic.  They contacted each other after his return from holiday in Italy.  He had never heard of a Leni Riefenstahl, but her offer to go to Africa was irresistible.  She arranged for vehicles and permits to be made, but like the last trip she had received no word on her issues.  So Leni and her crew left for Cairo without the proper papers as they had done previously. They arrived at the port and unloaded her Land Rovers to begin her journey. They arrived just with the Nuba just days before Christmas 1968.  She found that the Nuba had built her a house due to her repeated visits and helped her unload the truck.  When she unpacked the cameras for her first attempt at capturing the Nuba in two years she had found that the Nuba had taken on some western tendencies.  The wrestlers were wearing pants and bottles and cans had been used as decorations around belts.  The Nuba had become ashamed and embarrassed with their own bodies.  She was shocked that in just two years the civilization had become subjected to this so she stopped filming.  
	In 1972, Leni returned to the Nuba in order to capture the tribe for a planned book for Harper and Row and other publishing houses.  Leni had also written the text for the photos that dealt with tribe life, scared ritual, and personalities.  The book was a stunning artistic success because it was finally a work completed.  She titled it: The Last of the Nuba.  However, Leni found that the publishing process was wrought with troubles.  The various international publishing houses had text in various languages.  The French publisher Denöel had published the title: Les Nubiens.  Leni explained that the Nubians "have nothing to do with the Nuba, historically or ethnologically.  The Nubians come from the ancient kingdom of Nubia, which was once located in what is now the northern Sudan"(584).    
To escape the pressure of the publishing firms she headed to the Indian Ocean with Horst to try out something new: deep sea diving.  She took her test, although at her age, succeeded quite well with this challenge. 
	Leni spent 1974 mainly by traveling.  Horst and Leni visited the Red Sea before they prepped departed to the Nuba once again.  Leni fell in love with diving and dove for countless hours.  It was a magical parallel world where she was completely unknown and unfamiliar.  Before she left for the Nuba Francis Ford Coppola offered her a screening at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado.  When she arrived there was a vast amount of attention given to Riefenstahl.  Protestors were quite present and celebrities were often asked and gave their own opinion on Riefenstahl and her work.  Leni didnt relent in anyway.  They screened Das Blaue Licht to a favorable response to open the festival.  Then she arrived in New York and found that her book on the Nuba had sold better then expected.  
	The trip to back to the Sudan had been planned for months.  Although the trip had originally been planned for the Nuba they changed it to visit the Kau.  Leni had received information that noted that the Nuba had become relatively westernized and the trip would be unworthy for documentation.  Although it was somewhat true, Leni found out that young photographer had felt spited due to the success of her first book.  He had planned to shoot the Nuba but arrived later then Leni.  She flew back to the Sudan in December of 1974 and when she arrived she became ill.  In January, she traveled with Horst to Kau, which she felt was a disaster.  Tourist had made their way to the Nuba and western life had all but overtaken the Nuba when they were asked to pose for pictures in exchange for money.  Leni felt that her journey was useless if she had to capture the Nuba in this environment.  However, once they began to look deeper into the Kau they found more suitable subject matter.  Leni and Horst spent weeks hiding out in the heat often waiting for just the perfect shot.  Once again, Leni stumbled onto luck, as she was able to secure the friendship of several of the Kau.  She learned that going nude was reserved for those figures that had what the Kau felt were beautiful bodies.  She also learned that one of the most dramatic events to occur, such as the knife fighting, only took place between the select ages 28-30.  Prior to that age, the men could only paint their bodies.  Wrestling also acted as a training device for the knife duels.  With this information, Leni had a much easier time selecting subjects.   Leni had the chance to capture a fighting festival, great love festivals, and other culturally important events that proved very special for her new photography book on the Kau.  
	Leni had experience much more then she had ever thought she would during her travels in the Sudan.  The trip was a huge success and she had it all documented.  When she returned home to Munich she fell ill but soon felt better after seeing the first production of photos.  Stern, a major publication in Germany, offered Leni the chance to sell her pictures to them for publication.    Then she got word from the Sunday Times Magazine in England and they too wanted the new and unseen photos.  Leni had a massive worldwide success with the production of the Kau photos as houses such as National Geographic had offered her publishing rights.  
	As the 1970s came to an End, Riefenstahl felt a sense of accomplishment and pride at the work she had completed throughout her career.  She became a figure of pride for both art and feminist movements due to her undeniable sense of self-determination, a triumph of her will in many ways.  Meanwhile, she continuously is active both in her very private sphere and social life.  She still dives the most majestic oceans of the world and her films have been revived throughout the world in festivals.  In the 1980s she collected her diaries and information for her memoirs.  Alas, the only thing this figurehead of film could do is to become a film.  Now, at the age of 97, Leni Riefenstahls life story has been giving to Hollywoods star Jodie Foster for production.  It will undoubtedly have a happy ending.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Leni Riefenstahl's show-biz experience began with an experiment: she wanted to know what it felt like to dance on the stage. Success as a dancer gave way to film acting when she attracted the attention of film director Arnold Fanck, subsequently starring in some of his mountaineering pictures. With Fanck as her mentor, Riefenstahl began directing films.Her penchant for artistic work earned her acclaim and awards for her films across Europe. It was her work on Triumph des Willens (1935), a documentary commissioned by the Nazi government about Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich, that would come back to haunt her after the atrocities of World War II. Despite her protests to the contrary, Riefenstahl was considered an intricate part of the Third Reich's propaganda machine. Condemned by the international community, she did not make another movie for over 50 years.
Robert von Dassanowsky considers Tiefland (1954) to be Riefenstahl's cinematic statement on her rejection of Hitler and the Nazi regime.
      In early 2000, the 97 year old Riefensthal spent several weeks recovering in hospital after suffering broken ribs and lung injuries after being involved in a helicopter crash whilst filming in Sudan.
      She says she read Ernest Hemingway's "Green Hills of Africa" (1935) in 1955 and prepared immediately to visit the Sudan, which she did the following year, was accepted by and lived with the Nuba people for several months. She wrote three books, mainly photographic essays documenting the vanishing beauty of African people and cultures, from 1972 to 1997. Those are possibly her best refutations of accusations of her racist philosophy as the director of Olympia 1. Teil - Fest der Völker (1938).
      Ms. Riefenstahl lied about her age in 1973 to be passed an official licence to go deep-diving in the Pacific Ocean. She started collecting images of the underwater beauty then, and she did not stop when a shark showed his appreciation of her by head-butting her 3 times, as documented on a TV documentary in 2002.
      In an interview shortly before her death, she stated that if she had known that Triumph des Willens (1935) would have haunted her career, she would have never made it.
      Biography in: John Wakeman, editor. "World Film Directors, Volume One, 1890- 1945". Pages 952-957. New York: The H.W. Wilson Company, 1987.
      Holds the record for the longest length of time in between projects. After Tiefland (1954), it was 48 years before she directed another film, the documentary Impressionen unter Wasser (2003). She's also the oldest director to helm a documentary. She was 99 when she made the latter film.
      A band called the World/Inferno Friendship Society has a song out called "Leni at the End of Time.".
      (August 22, 2003) Married for the 2nd time to her boyfriend of 35 years Horst Kettner on her 101st birthday and just 2 weeks before her death.
      alling at age 83 her 1936 film Olympia 1. Teil - Fest der Völker (1938), which identified her with Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party] "They killed me then. I am a ghost."
      [In a 1993 interview, commenting on her work with the Nazi party] "Being sorry isn't nearly enough, but I can't tear myself apart or destroy myself. It's so terrible. I've suffered anyway for over half a century and it will never end, until I die. It's such an incredible burden, that to say 'sorry'... it's inadequate, it expresses too little."
      I told Hitler that filming the party congress was too difficult for a girl. I told him the men are jealous and the problems I encountered affected my nerves. Hitler became very angry. He told Goebbels that when he gave an order, Goebbels was supposed to obey it. Hitler then told me that I must make a film of the congress in 1934 but I protested, saying that the same thing would happen. He... assured me that there would be no interference.
      Really, if I start a work I forget food. I forget that I am a woman. I forget my dress, I only see my work. I forget because I am fascinated by my work.
      I was never Hitler's mistress - although I was dazzled by him. These are nothing but lies. It is senseless to call me the queen of the Nazis. I have never spoken a word about politics. It is all lies and forgeries. If I had really been a Nazi I would have killed myself, like Eva Braun. I have never said that Hitler was handsome and intelligent. I am not an idiot. I have never seen mass executions and I have never seen a concentration camp.
      If I, as so many other colleagues, would have worked for the sake of money, I could have become a millionaire. But money was of no importance to me. I worked on a film for years until I thought it artistically perfected. I was my own boss, nobody could tell me what to do. Had I ever had the impression that my freedom as a creative artist would be limited, I would have gone abroad.

 Leni Riefenstahl, the woman known as “Hitler’s filmmaker,” made some of the greatest and most innovative documentaries ever made. They are also insidious glorifications of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. Now, Steven Bach reveals the truths and lies behind Riefenstahl’s lifelong self-vindication as an apolitical artist who claimed to know nothing of the Holocaust and denied her complicity with the criminal regime she both used and sanctified.A riveting and illuminating biography of one of the most fascinating and controversial personalities of the twentieth century.

       Tiefenthaler, an actress and writer of Austrian descent, was raised and educated in England, but her reading of Bach's biography of the famed and reviled Nazi filmmaker betrays a puzzling lack of familiarity with the rhythms of the English language. Her fruity accent notwithstanding, Tiefenthaler delivers a halting performance, pausing in the middle of linked phrases, or unexpectedly extending a sentence, as if she had not realized that further work remained to be done. The reading of an audiobook should be fluid, as if the reader was the composer of the book, intimately familiar with each and every word. Tiefenthaler evokes images of a reader squinting at a piece of paper, attempting to suss out the words on the fly, and the results cannot help detracting from Bach's solid work.

       *Starred Review* Riefenstahl revered "what was beautiful, strong, and healthy," but her greatest achievements, the paradigmatic films Triumph of the Will  and Olympia  were made to glorify Hitler and the Third Reich. In his penetrating and superbly well-written biography, Bach ponders the difficult questions raised by Riefenstahl's many-chaptered life (she was 101 when she died in 2003). Is there a moral dimension to art? Is devotion to making art an excuse for moral failings? As Bach expertly elucidates the opportunistic Riefenstahl's exploits as a dancer, actress, filmmaker, Nazi insider, African adventurer, photographer, and deep-sea diver, he takes measure, as no one else has, of her ruthless ambition, idealized aesthetics, and extreme egocentricity. Dexterously fitting together newly recovered puzzle pieces, Bach presents evidence suggesting that Riefenstahl was part Jewish; explicates her close relationships with Hitler, Goebbels, and Albert Speer; documents her use of "film slaves" borrowed from "holding pens for the Holocaust"; and analyzes her "self-righteous entitlement" and personal revisionist history. Possessed of phenomenal vitality and physical courage, if lacking in compassion and integrity, Riefenstahl loved fairy tales, and, as Bach so perceptively and artistically reveals, she succeeded in living one, however insidious.

This is one of two current biographies out on Leni Riefenstahl (1902-2003), who remains somewhat radioactive give her close association with Hitler and other top Nazi leaders during the 1930's and 1940's.  The author is a former motion picture executive turned professor, who previously has written an excellent biography of Leni's contemporary and rival, Marlene Dietrich.  Leni is generally seen as being not a particularly pleasant person, who manifested an extreme degree of ego and far less concern about truth in the historical record.  This book, while it does not seek to mitigate those allegations, and does in fact add some damaging new information, really the author is much more interested in charting the contours of Leni's life, the times she lived in, and those with whom she interacted than passing moral judgments.  One of the strengths of the author is his ability to concisely set the stage at various points in Leni's life.  His brief discussion of effervescent Berlin during the 1920's particularly is rich in insight and helps enormously in explaining the environment out of which Leni emerged.  Similarly skillful is his discussion of the top Nazi party leadership (particularly Goebbels as propaganda guru) and political developments in Germany in the 1930's--just enough so that the reader is prepared to understand Leni's activities during this period.  Bach is at his best, though, in focusing upon Leni as the film maker, whether it is her 1930's films such as "Triumph of the Will" and her Olympic films, or her later films (including the controversial "Tiefland")and African documentaries. He also casts an experienced eye on her many photographic book projects, especially those relating to Africa and coral reefs.Read more ›
22 of 23 people found the following review helpfulFascinating biography of the complex and controversial Leni Riefenstahl
This biography of Leni Riefenstahl by Steven Bach is compelling reading.  It tells the tale of someone with great talent--but also someone who could never come honestly to grips with her role in Nazi Germany.  Someone who, in the end, was a mediocre actress and dancer and a very talented filmmaker and photographer.  But even with her successes, many felt that with Riefenstahl, she put as much focus on herself as on her works.  And, with some of her works, critics noted that they were technically wonderful, but not with much soul or heart.Her early years featured a strong, almost overbearing father; she early learned how to try to "get around him."  Her mother Bertha (whom some suspected of being Jewish) was supportive of her, whereas her father wanted nothing to do with Leni's visions for her future as a dancer.  Injury derailed her from dance, and she began acting, with her most prominent genre being the so-called Alpine films. While she saw herself as a terrific actress, outside of some exceptions, she appears to have been rather ordinary.  But, as throughout her life, her self-image was far more positive; she never had the ability to be self-critical.  One virtue that emerged early in her films was physical courage (page 43), "the only personal quality she possessed that colleagues and even enemies could later praise without reservation."Through a series of events, she ended up in a position to direct a film featuring Adolf Hitler at the 1933 Nazi party congress, "Victory of Faith."  It was not as well done as her later, much better known films, but it provided her experience in developing techniques, coming to understand camera work, and so on.Read more ›
Steve Bach has done a remarkable job of painting a complex, life-like and believable portrait of Leni Riefenstahl, the (in)famous Nazi-era film director. He does so both by pointing out her many shortcomings, (not the least of which is a rapacious sucking-up to Hitler and his cronies), and also by admiring her ground-breaking cinematic genius. This is an unusual feat for a critic who is politically liberal --a rare case of someone able to separate his reflexive distaste for the many moral and ideological compromises she made to fuel her rise from being a plumber's daughter, to becoming one of the most creative film directors of the 20th Century.Riefenstahl lived two separate lives: her life as a second-rate actress which segued into becoming a sensational film director and naturalist photographer; and her life of spending the last 60 years of her career defending her casting-couch activities of the first 20. Active to the very end, she died in 2003, age 101--a camera still in her hand.How then to judge Ms Riefenstahl; how then to judge the book? As we never seem to learn, great talent does not necessarily come from great people. Why are we so regularly surprised to learn that geniuses are often terribly flawed in other aspects of their character. (This has made a "neutral" portrayal of Hitler impossible to depict. No one has been able to separate the evil of the man from his political genius--a genius that turned a prostate nation into a world power almost overnight.) Amazon.com was so repelled by Riefenstahl that for months they resolutely refuse to post more than two luke-warm reviews, in spite of attempts by many readers to add to the list.Read more ›
      The narration of this book is beyond dreadful - it's appalling! I gave up after 10 chapters due to the continued mispronunciations of rather basic English.

      Steven Bach's work on the filmmaker Leni Reifensthal was a book that captivated my interest from start to finish.
      Leni Riefenstahl is not an easy subject for a biographer. Yes, there is a mountain of material, and everyone has an opinion on her.
      While I was looking forward to reading this book I found it poorly written.  It seemed based upon loosely connected facts held together with lengthly excessively worded passages.
      Steven Bach's book is an entertaining read, perhaps more so for those with little previous knowledge of Riefenstahl, the events leading up to the second world war and the fate of...
      Of all the existing books on Leni Riefenstahl--and there are a lot of them out there, including Riefenstahl's own self-exculpatory memoirs--Bach's treatment is in my opinion the...
      There have been many attemps to stain Riefenstahl's image along the years, and this one is not the most successful at all. It serves little purpose to the academic bunch.
      After reading Jurgen Trimborn's admirable but somewhat inaccessible biography of Riefenstahl, I sought out this book in hopes that it would be friendlier to a Riefenstahl novice...
      Not since Albert Goldman's ELVIS has a dense, full length biography of a sexy, glamorous larger than life legend been written with such sadistic relish, such delicious malicious...
