Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark, Count of Monpezat, RE, SKmd (Frederik André Henrik Christian; Danish pronunciation: [ˈfʁæðˀʁæɡ̊]; born 26 May 1968) is the heir apparent to the throne of Denmark. Frederik is the elder son of Queen Margrethe II and Henrik, the Prince Consort. If he succeeds to the Danish throne as expected, he will be known as His Majesty, King Frederik X.
Crown Prince Frederik was born at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, on 26 May 1968, to the then Princess Margrethe, oldest daughter of Frederick IX and heiress presumptive to the Danish throne, and Prince Henrik.
He was christened on 24 June 1968, at Holmens Kirke, in Copenhagen. He was named Frederik after his maternal grandfather, King Frederick IX, continuing the Danish royal tradition of the heir apparent being named either Frederik or Christian. His middle names honour his paternal grandfather, André de Laborde de Monpezat; his father, Prince Henrik; and his maternal great-grandfather, Christian X. Frederik's godparents include his paternal uncle, Count Etienne de Laborde de Monpezat; his maternal aunt, Queen Anne-Marie of Greece; Prince Georg of Denmark; Baron Christian de Watteville-Berckheim; Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte of Luxembourg; and Mrs Birgitta Juel Hillingsø.

The wedding took place on 14 May 2004 at Copenhagen Cathedral, Copenhagen.
Frederik has a special interest in scientific research, climate change and sustainability.[5] The Prince was interviewed by Financial Times and CNN International, in the Future Cities program, for their commitment to sustainability.[6][7] He participated in expeditions, forums and events on climate.[8][9][10][11][12] The prince has represented Denmark as a promoter of sustainable Danish energy.[13][14][15] The prince was one of the authors of the Polartokt Kongelig (Polar Cruise Royal), about the challenges of climate, published in 2009 with a preface written by Kofi Annan.[16][17][18] In 2010, wrote the book's foreword Naturen og klimaændringerne i Nordøstgrønland (The nature and climate change in Greenland).[19] Supports scientific research projects, as a patron, as expeditionary, with regular attendance at events and through his foundation, Kronprins Frederiks Fond.[20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32]
The Prince encourages Danish participation in sports.[33] He is a patron and honorary member of various sports organizations[34][35][36] and a member of the International Olympic Committee.[37] He also promotes an active lifestyle in society.[38][39][40]
Frederik is an avid sportsman,[41] running marathons in Copenhagen, New York and Paris, and completing the 42 kilometers with a respectable time of 3 hours, 22 minutes and 50 seconds in the Copenhagen Marathon.[42][43] In 2013 he completed the KMD Ironman Copenhagen in the time of 10:45:32 and is the first royal person to complete an Ironman.[44]

The purpose of the foundation is to provide financial assistance to students of social policy and sciences, for one year’s study at Harvard.[58] and provide financial support for scientific expeditions, particularly to foreign parts of the world, including Greenland and the Faeroe Islands and sports purposes, including those with a particularly social aspect.[59]
The Crown Prince participated in an expedition to Mongolia in 1986. In 2000, the Crown Prince participated in "Expedition Sirius 2000", which was a four-month and 2,795 km dog-sledge expedition in the northern part of Greenland. The expedition Sirius marked the 50-year anniversary of the Sirius Patrol. Prince Frederik was part of the polar expedition as was a film photographer, whose job was to ensure an optimal coverage of this event.[61][62][63]
On 9 October 2009, Crown Prince Frederik was elected as a member of the International Olympic Committee, replacing former Danish member Kaj Holm. The Crown Prince was elected with the votes 77 for and 9 against. The Crown Prince's candidature was met with some skepticism in Denmark, as it would mean that the Crown Prince would be sitting in a semi-political committee along with several people who are suspected or even convicted of criminal acts. Another concern was the doubts on whether the Crown Prince's loyalty would be towards his country and government, as the Danish constitution prescribes, or with the International Olympic Committee, as is sworn upon election to the committee. The Crown Prince denied that it would ever become an issue.
The Crown Prince has announced that his point of focus and reason for joining the International Olympic Committee is to promote an active lifestyle among youth. He is elected for an eight-year period, and made it clear that he would terminate his membership upon ascending the Danish throne.
The Crown Prince and Crown Princess currently reside at Frederik VIII's Palace, one of the four palaces that make up the Amalienborg Palace complex. From May 2004 to mid-December 2010, they resided at The Chancellery House, a side building at Fredensborg Palace.
The Crown Prince receives an allowance or appanage set by the Folketing of approximately DKK 14,500,000 or about €1,950,000, of which the Crown Princess is entitled to 10%.
As a descendant of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom through her granddaughter, Princess Margaret of Connaught, daughter of her third son, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, Prince Frederik is on the Line of succession to the British Throne as well.

=======================================================
Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark, Countess of Monpezat, RE (Mary Elizabeth; née Donaldson; born 5 February 1972 in Hobart, Australia) is the wife of Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark. Frederik is the heir apparent to the throne of Denmark, which means that at the time Frederik inherits the throne, Mary will automatically become Queen consort of Denmark.
The couple met at the Slip Inn, a pub in Sydney, when the prince was visiting Australia during the 2000 Summer Olympics. Their official engagement in 2003 and their marriage the following year were the subject of extensive attention from Australian and European news media, which portrayed the marriage as a modern "fairytale" romance between a prince and a commoner.[1]
Mary Elizabeth Donaldson was born the youngest of the four children of mathematician and professor John Dalgleish Donaldson and his first wife, Henrietta (née Horne), both Scottish.[2] She was named after her grandmothers, Mary Dalgleish and Elizabeth Gibson Melrose. Henrietta Donaldson was executive assistant to the vice-chancellor of the University of Tasmania. In 2001, four years after her death, John Donaldson married the British author and novelist Susan Moody.[3]
Mary Donaldson was born and raised in Hobart. In childhood, she was heavily involved in sports and other extracurricular activities both at school and elsewhere. She studied piano, flute and clarinet, and played basketball and hockey. Her early love of horses led her to competition riding as a teenager, on her horse, Diana.[citation needed]
Mary began primary school in Clear Lake City, near Houston, Harris County, Texas, while her father was working there. On returning to Hobart, she attended Sandy Bay Infants School, Waimea Heights Primary School and then Taroona High School in Tasmania. She attended Waimea Heights Primary School from 1978 to 1982. Mary completed her secondary education at Taroona High School and Hobart Matriculation College.
She studied at the University of Tasmania for five years.[4] From 1989 to 1994 Mary completed a combined degree in Commerce and Law (BCom, LLB) at the University of Tasmania, and graduated on 27 May 1995. Between 1994 and 1996, Mary attended a graduate program and qualified with certificates in advertising from The Advertising Federation of Australia (AFA) and direct marketing from the Australian Direct Marketing Association (ADMA).[4]
The crown princess's mother tongue is English and Danish is her second language. She studied French during her secondary education. In 2002, she briefly tutored in English in Paris.[4] On meeting Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark she studied Danish as a foreign language at Studieskolen in 2003.[5]
While studying in Tasmania, Donaldson reportedly had a joint business interest in a company called Kingcash, with Brent Annells, with whom she had a seven-year relationship in the 1990s.[6][7]
She worked for Australian and global advertising agencies after graduating in 1995.[4][8][9] Upon graduation Mary moved to Melbourne to work in advertising. She became a trainee in marketing and communications with the Melbourne office of DDB Needham, taking a position of account executive. In 1996, Mary was employed by Mojo Partners as an account manager. In 1998, six months after her mother's death, she resigned and travelled to America and Europe. In Edinburgh, she worked for three months as an account manager with Rapp Collins Worldwide; then, in early 1999, she was appointed as an account director with the international advertising agency Young & Rubicam in Sydney.[4]
In June 2000, she moved to a smaller Australian agency, Love Branding, working for a short time as the company's first account director. However, in the (Australian) spring of 2000 until December 2001, she became sales director and a member of the management team of Belle Property, a real estate firm specialising in luxury property. In the first half of 2002 Mary taught English at a business school in Paris but, on moving to Denmark permanently, she was employed by Microsoft Business Solutions (5 September 2002 – 24 September 2003) near Copenhagen as a project consultant for business development, communications and marketing.[4]
Mary Donaldson met Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark at the Slip Inn[10] during the 2000 Summer Olympics on 16 September in Sydney. He was previously identified by her friends as the Crown Prince of Denmark.[11] They conducted a long-distance relationship by phone, email and letter and Frederik made a number of discreet visits to Australia. On 15 November 2001 the Danish weekly magazine Billed Bladet named Mary as Frederik's girlfriend. Mary moved to Europe in December 2001, while she was working as an English tutor in Paris. On 24 September 2003 the Danish court announced that Queen Margrethe II intended to give her consent to the marriage at the State Council meeting scheduled for 8 October 2003.
Frederik presented Mary with an engagement ring featuring an emerald-cut diamond and two emerald-cut ruby baguettes.[12] The couple became officially engaged on 8 October 2003.
Mary Donaldson and Crown Prince Frederik married on 14 May 2004 in Copenhagen Cathedral, in Copenhagen.[13] Mary wore a wedding gown designed by Danish designer Uffe Frank and had a small bridal party which included her two sisters and her friend Amber Petty, a radio announcer on commercial radio in Australia. Frederik was supported by his brother Prince Joachim. Three of Mary's nieces, Erin and Kate Stephens and Madisson Woods, were flower girls; Frederik's nephew Prince Nikolai of Denmark and first cousin once removed, Count Richard von Pfeil und Klein-Ellguth were pageboys. The wedding[14] was celebrated in Copenhagen and at Fredensborg Palace. The couple reportedly spent their honeymoon in Africa.
The Danish Folketing (parliament) passed a special law (Mary's Law)[15] giving Mary Donaldson Danish citizenship upon her marriage, a standard procedure for new foreign members of the royal family; she was previously a dual citizen of Australia and the United Kingdom. Formerly a Presbyterian, Mary converted to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Denmark upon marriage. Shortly before entering the royal family, Mary signed a marriage agreement similar to those of her father-in-law and her former sister-in-law. The agreement was subsequently updated in late 2006. The details of these have never been made public, but it can be assumed that they concern financial matters, royal status and custodial rights to the children in the event of a divorce.
The Crown Princess and her family currently reside at Frederik VIII's Palace, one of the four palaces that make up the Amalienborg Palace complex. From May 2004 they have also resided at The Chancellery House, a building in the park at Fredensborg Palace.

She is pictured here surrounded by Queen Máxima of the Netherlands; Willem-Alexander, King of The Netherlands; Crown Princess of Norway; and Beatrix of the Netherlands, former queen regnant of The Netherlands. Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark stands at the far left.
Following the wedding, the couple embarked upon a summer working tour of mainland Denmark aboard the royal yacht Dannebrog, and then to Greenland and later the 2004 Athens Olympics. In 2005, during the celebrations for the 200th anniversary of Hans Christian Andersen, the royal family was involved in related events throughout the year. Frederik and Mary marked the anniversary in London, New York and in Australia, where Mary was made Honorary Hans Christian Andersen Ambassador to Australia in the Utzon Room of the Sydney Opera House. In 2005 the royal family visited Faroe Islands.
Since becoming Crown Princess of Denmark, Mary has made a number of international visits[16] and Frederik and Mary participated in the reburial ceremonies for Empress Maria Feodorovna in Denmark and Saint Petersburg. In November 2009, Mary made a surprise visit to Danish soldiers in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. One of the Crown Princess's stops was FOB Armadillo.[17]
In the context of immigrant issues in Denmark, Mary has visited the disadvantaged migrant areas of Vollsmose (2006),[18] Gellerup (2007),[19] and Viborg (2010),[20] and has participated in integration projects and to teach the Danish language to refugees.[21][22][23] As patron of the Danish Refugee Council Mary visited Uganda (2008)[24] and East Africa (2011)[25] and supports fundraising for the region. [26][27]
Mary is assisted by her ladies in waiting. Her first lady in waiting was English-speaking Countess Victoria Bernstorff-Gyldensteen. She then appointed her friend Caroline Heering as a lady in waiting. Tanya Doky later became lady in waiting, while Caroline Heering was assigned the role of Mary's personal assistant.
Mary has played an active role in promoting an anti-bullying program based on an Australian model through the auspices of Denmark's Save the Children.[28] Mary is also involved in a new campaign to raise awareness and safe practices among Danes about skin cancer through The Danish Cancer Society. In September 2007 Mary formally established the Mary Foundation, with capital from public and private donations, to advance cultural diversity and encourage a sense of the right to belong and contribute to society for those who are socially isolated or excluded.
Mary was voted Woman of the Year 2008 by a Danish magazine, Alt for damerne. The Princess donated her cash reward to charity.[29] She was interviewed by Parade Magazine (US)[30] and television programs of Andrew Denton (Australia)[31] and USA Today (USA).[22]
As a native English-speaker, Mary's main priority from the time of her engagement was to master the Danish language. Mary has acknowledged that this was a challenge for her in several interviews at the time of her engagement and marriage.[31][32] If Frederik ascends the throne, Mary will be the first Australian-born woman to be a queen consort.[33]
His Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark, Count of Monpezat (Henrik Carl Joachim Alain), born 4 May 2009.
Her Royal Highness Princess Estelle, Duchess of Östergötland (Estelle Silvia Ewa Mary of Sweden), born 23 February 2012.
Mary is an active patron of Denmark's third-highest-earning export industry, the fashion industry and is Patron of the Copenhagen Fashion Summit.[34]
She has been named one of the world's most fashionable people in Vanity Fair's annual International Best-Dressed List[35] and has posed and given interviews for magazines including Vogue Australia (where she used pieces of foreign designers, such as Hugo Boss, Prada, Louis Vuitton or Gaultier, and Danish designers, as Malene Birger and Georg Jensen), Dansk (Danish Magazine, dedicated to Danish fashion), German Vogue (where was photographed between pieces of Danish modern art in Amalienborg Palace).[36][37][38] Mary also posed for other magazines during her life as a royal, such as Women's Weekly Australia magazine (to which she spoke in several occasions about her life as a royal and her family) and Parade Magazine.
Since 2004 Crown Princess Mary has steadily worked to establish her relationships with various organisations, their issues, missions, programmes and staff. Mary's patronages range across areas of culture, the fashion industry, humanitarian aid, support for research and science, social and health patronages and sport (golf and swimming). The organisations for which she is patron have reported positive outcomes through their relationship with Mary and there are various reports in the Danish media and on some of the websites of the organisations themselves about Mary being quite involved in her working relationship with them. Mary is currently involved in supporting anti-obesity programs through the World Health Organization, Regional Office for Europe.[40]
Mary's current patronages include cultural organisations,[41][42] the Danish fashion industry[43] humanitarian aid,[44] research and science,[45] social, health and humanitarian organisations[46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55] and sporting organisations.[56][57]
Crown Princess Mary is also an Honorary Life Governor of the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute based at the Garvan Institute/St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, a member of the International Committee of Women Leaders for Mental Health and a member of various sporting clubs (riding, golf and yachting). In June 2010, it was announced that Crown Princess Mary has become Patron of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, "to support the agency's work to promote maternal health and safer motherhood in more than 150 developing nations".[58] Mary lends her support to a number of other 'one-off' Danish causes, industry events and international conferences. In 2011, the Westmead Cancer Centre at Westmead Hospital in Sydney was renamed the Crown Princess Mary Cancer Care Centre Westmead.[59]
On 11 September 2007 Crown Princess Mary announced the establishment of the Mary Foundation[60] at the inaugural meeting at Amalienborg Palace. The initial funds of DKK 1.1 million were collected in Denmark and Greenland and donated to Frederik and Mary as a wedding gift in 2004. Crown Princess Mary is the chairwoman of eight trustees. The Mary Foundation aims to improve lives compromised by environment, heredity, illness or other circumstances which can isolate or exclude people socially.
Mary is styled as "Her Royal Highness The Crown Princess of Denmark, Countess of Monpezat". She has been Crown Princess of Denmark since her marriage and Countess of Monpezat by marriage since 29 April 2008, when Queen Margrethe II granted the title to her male-line descendants.[61]
With the marriage in 2004, the Crown Princess Mary was honoured with the Order of the Elephant, and her father John Dalgleish Donaldson with the Order of the Dannebrog. In accordance with the statutes of the Danish Royal Orders, both the Crown Princess and her father were granted a personal coat of arms, this for display in the Chapel of the Royal Orders at Frederiksborg Castle. The main field of the Crown Princess' coat of arms is or tinctured and shows a gules MacDonald eagle and a Sable tinctured boat both symbolising her Scottish ancestry. The chief field is azure tinctured and shows two gold Commonwealth Stars from the Coat of arms of Australia, and a gold rose in between, depicted as her personal symbol. Above the shield is placed the heraldic crown of a Crown Prince of Denmark.[69]
The coat of arms of her father is almost identical to that of the Crown Princess, but a gold infinity symbol is depicted (symbolising his career as an Australian mathematician), instead of the gold Rose. Above his shield is instead placed a barred helmet topped with a gules rampant lion, which is turned outward. The lion is derived from the Scottish coat of arms and also from the arms of Tasmania and Hobart. Both coats of arms were approved in 2006 and placed in the Chapel of the Royal Orders in 2007.[69]
The Crown Princess' coat of arms and its details have yet to be published on the Crown Princely couple's official website.
The generations are numbered from the implementation of hereditary monarchy by Frederick III in 1660.

=======================================================
Frederick Henry, or Frederik Hendrik in Dutch (29 January 1584 – 14 March 1647), was the sovereign Prince of Orange and stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, and Overijssel from 1625 to 1647.
As the leading soldier in the Dutch wars against Spain, his main achievement was the successful Siege of 's-Hertogenbosch in 1629, It was the main Spanish base and a well-fortified city protected by an experienced Spanish garrison and by formidable water defenses. His strategy was the successful neutralization of the threat of inundation of the area around 's-Hertogenbosch and his capture of the Spanish storehouse at Wesel.[1]
Frederick Henry was born on 29 January 1584 in Delft, Holland, Dutch Republic. He was the youngest child of William the Silent and Louise de Coligny. His father William was stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, and Friesland. His mother Louise was daughter of the Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny, and was the fourth wife of his father. He was thus the half brother of his predecessor Maurice of Orange, deceased in 1625.
Frederick Henry was born six months before his father's assassination on 10 July 1584. The boy was trained to arms by his elder brother Maurice, one of the finest generals of his age. After Maurice threatened to legimitize his illegitimate children if he did not marry, Frederick Henry married Amalia of Solms-Braunfels in 1625. His illegitimate son by Margaretha Catharina Bruyns (1595–1625), Frederick Nassau de Zuylenstein was born in 1624 before his marriage. This son later became the governor of the young William III of England for seven years.
On the death of Maurice in 1625 without legitimate issue, Frederick Henry succeeded him in his paternal dignities and estates, and also in the stadtholderates of the five provinces of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Overijssel and Guelders, and in the important posts of captain and admiral-general of the Union (commander-in-chief of the Dutch States Army and of the Dutch navy).
Frederick Henry proved himself almost as good a general as his brother, and a far more capable statesman and politician. For twenty-two years he remained at the head of government in the United Provinces, and in his time the power of the stadtholderate reached its highest point. The "Period of Frederick Henry," as it is usually styled by Dutch writers, is generally accounted the golden age of the republic. It was marked by great military and naval triumphs, by worldwide maritime and commercial expansion, and by a wonderful outburst of activity in the domains of art and literature.
The chief military exploits of Frederick Henry were the sieges and captures of Grol in 1627, 's-Hertogenbosch in 1629, of Maastricht in 1632, of Breda in 1637, of Sas van Gent in 1644, and of Hulst in 1645. During the greater part of his administration the alliance with France against Spain had been the pivot of Frederick Henry's foreign policy, but in his last years he sacrificed the French alliance for the sake of concluding a separate peace with Spain, by which the United Provinces obtained from that power all the advantages they had been seeking for eighty years.
Frederick Henry built the country houses Huis Honselaarsdijk, Huis ter Nieuwburg, and for his wife Huis ten Bosch, and he renovated the Noordeinde Palace in The Hague. Huis Honselaarsdijk and Huis ter Nieuwburg are now demolished.[2]
Frederick Henry died on 14 March 1647 in The Hague, Holland, Dutch Republic. He left a wife, a son William II, Prince of Orange, four daughters, and the illegitimate son Frederick Nassau de Zuylenstein.
On Frederick Henry's death, he was buried with great pomp beside his father and brother at Delft. The treaty of Munster, ending the long struggle between the Dutch and the Spaniards, was not actually signed until 30 January 1648, the illness and death of the stadtholder having caused a delay in the negotiations. Frederick Henry left an account of his campaigns in his Mémoires de Frédéric Henri (Amsterdam, 1743). See Cambridge Mod. Hist. vol. iv. chap. 24.

"My aim is to be a Danish rallying point to awaken the people's sense of nationality," Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark once said. "I want to be a good ambassador for my country. But I will not shut myself away in a castle. I will be myself. I will be a human being."						
						The handsome prince has already been highly successful in carving out a space for himself and winning over his countrymen, as evidenced by the fact that he has been voted "Dane of the Year" on a number of occasions. Frederik an officer in the military services, a trained diplomat and an accomplished sportsman - has succeeded in becoming the all-round royal who appeals to all sections of society. 
Born at Copenhagen\'s Rigshospitalet on May 26, 1968, Frederik Andre Henrik Christian is the oldest son of Queen Margrethe of Denmark and Henri de Laborde de Monpezat. The young prince was thrust into the limelight early; when he was just three years old his grandfather, King Frederik IX died. His mother\'s subsequent accession to the throne meant he took on the title of crown prince. 
After finishing private school, Frederik studied foreign languages at a Copehagen high school. Along with his younger brother Joachim, he later spent a year 1982/3 studying in his father\'s native country, at the Ecole des Roches in Verneuil-sur-Avre in Normandy. 
Upon turning 18 Frederik was given a seat on the Council of State, and from that time was empowered to assume the duties of Head of State whenever his mother was abroad. The same year, he started the first of two stints in the military, serving in the infantry regiment of the Royal Life Guards and then, in 1988, joining the Royal Hussars as a First Lieutenant. 
In 1989, the crown prince became the first Danish royal to study for an academic degree, when he began a course in Political Science and Constitutional Law at the University of Aarhus. This included a year at Harvard University in the US, where, apart from studying, he worked among the city\'s homeless. 
After graduation Frederik returned to the military, this time the Navy. He was chosen from among 300 applicants to serve in the elite Royal Frogmen Corps, where he was to pick up the nickname "Pingo". Returning to civilian life in the late 1990s, he took a up a diplomatic posting as first secretary at the Danish Embassy in Paris. 
Privately the prince has a passion for cars and is an avid actor and sportsman, running marathons in Copenhagen, New York and Paris. He is also a keen football player and sailor.
Once romantically linked with model Katja Storkholm Nielsen and singer Maria Montelle, Frederik was one of Europe\'s most eligible bachelors until, in the autumn of 2003, his engagement to former Sydney real estate agent Mary Donaldson was announced. The couple, who met at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, were wed in Copenhagen on May 14, 2004. Their first child, Prince Christian Valdemar Henri John, was born October 15, 2005.

=======================================================
When her engagement to Danish Crown Prince Frederik was announced Australian-born marketing executive Mary Donaldson shared one of her early royal experiences watching Lady Diana wed the Prince of Wales on TV in 1981. She admits she didn't see herself taking a similar trip down the aisle, however.						
"My biggest memory is of Diana walking up the red carpet with a very, very long train," she says. "But I don't recall wishing that one day I would be a princess. I wanted to be a veterinarian." 
Mary Elizabeth Donaldson was born on February 5, 1972, in Hobart, Tasmania, the youngest of Scottish-born maths professor John Donaldson and university secretary Henrietta Clark Donaldson's four children. The princess-to-be's parents had emigrated from Edinburgh to Australia in the early Sixties, becoming citizens of the country in 1975. (Mum Henrietta passed away in 1997, and John married author Susan Elizabeth Moody four years later.)
An avid athlete at Taroona High School, Mary was captain of the girls' hockey and swimming teams and very involved in equestrian pursuits. She continued her education at Hobart Matriculation College where she served on the basketball team before wrapping up her studies at the University of Tasmania, from which she graduated in 1994 with a Bachelors degree in Commerce and Law. 
The fresh-faced young graduate dived into professional life, moving to Melbourne, where she accepted a position at an international advertising agency. Her career would eventually lead her into the world of public relations, and culminate in her last pre-royal post as a project consultant for Microsoft Business Solutions in Denmark.
Her life was to change forever when she met a sporty young man who introduced himself as "Fred" at a Sydney hotel pub in October 2000. They'd each arrived with a separate group of friends. The king of Spain's nephew, Bruno Gomez-Acebo, was the link between the two cliques but by the end of the evening Mary and Frederik were deep in conversation, seeming to have eyes only for each other. "The first time we met we shook hands," she recalled. "I didn't know he was the prince of Denmark. Half an hour later someone came up to me and said, 'Do you know who these people are?'." 
Over the next three years the two were often seen together in both Australia and Denmark. "Frederik is one of those people who being around makes you happy. His intelligence and kindness and he's quite funny as well. We have a connection of the mind," says Mary. It wasn't until April 2003 that Queen Margrethe publicly acknowledged the relationship, though, fuelling rumours of a pending engagement. Six months later the palace announced a royal wedding would take place the following spring. 
Despite having to fulfil a demanding series of requirements - she agreed to relinquish her Australian citizenship, convert from her Presbyterian faith to the Danish Lutheran Church, learn Danish and agree to give up her rights to the couple's children in case of divorce - Mary tackled the challenge of her new position with aplomb. "Today is the first day of my new role," she said after appearing on the palace balcony as Frederik's fiancée for the first time. "It is something that will evolve over time and I have much to learn and experience." 
On May 14, 2004, the pretty brunette with the captivating smile walked down the aisle with her prince in a bridal outfit which encompassed both her Australian heritage and the history of the family she would now be joining. A gown by Danish designer Uffe Frank was topped off with a veil first used by Crown Princess Margret of Sweden in 1905. While her bouquet consisted of Australian eucalyptus known as Snow gum plus flowers from the palace garden. 
The couple's first child, Prince Christian Valdemar Henri John, was born October 15, 2005, and their second, Princess Isabella Henrietta Ingrid Margrethe, followed on April 21, 2007. Then three years later there was more good news. The palace confirmed Mary was expecting twins, and the bouncing babies arrived in January 2011.  
Speaking to press outside the hospital, their proud dad described their newborn baby boy, weighing 5lb 9oz, and their 5lb 7oz girl as a "miracle times two". Royal watchers will have to wait a little longer to learn the new arrivals' names, however. According to Danish tradition, the names of royal babies are not announced until their christening, three months after their birth.
Mary's grace, beauty and professionalism have won over her the people of her new homeland, with one poll finding 75 per cent of Danes believed she would make a good queen.

The Crown Prince CoupleHis Royal Highness Crown Prince Frederik and Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Mary are Denmark's young and very popular successor couple. Mary Donaldson appeared from a remote country and with her grace and nature won the heart of not only the Crown Prince, but also half the kingdom.
In an inveterate monarchy like the Danish, the successor couple period has a special status. On the one hand, it marks the end of the long and by no means safe journey of a crown prince or crown princess towards marriage with another person. On the other hand, everyone knows that the wedding is not itself the end, but only the precursor of something even greater, i.e. the accession. That is why all expectations are mercilessly directed towards the couple. 
In addition, the nation only experiences a successor couple decades apart. It most recently happened in the brief period 1967-72, when Denmark's current sovereign, Queen Margrethe II (b.1940), and His Royal Highness Prince Henrik (b.1934) played the role. Moreover, in the nature of things nobody knows how long the period will be. In other words, everybody needs to enjoy the time while it lasts. 
Crown Prince Frederik met Mary Donaldson during the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000. He was then 32 and she was 28. Rumours of a relationship soon appeared in the Danish weekly press, but they only flourished after Mary Donaldson got a job in Copenhagen in 2002. Previously, she and Frederik had both worked in Paris for a while. 
On 8 October 2003, Her Majesty the Queen publicly announced their engagement. At that day's press conference, Mary Donaldson addressed the Danish people for the first time. She was able to do so in the nation's own language, Danish, which many have found difficult to access. This may not seem a big thing, but for a small nation of five million inhabitants, it was an important signal that Mary was ready to take on the task of Crown Princess according to the best traditions of the royal house. The wedding took place six months later. 
The wedding revealed that the couple belong to a younger generation. Thus, the week before the wedding included a big rock concert in honour of the couple in Idrætsparken in Copenhagen, giving by the leading Danish rock musicians. And in his speech to Mary at the wedding banquet, the Crown Prince quoted poetic rock lyrics by the contemporary Danish musician Lars H.U.G. Their love was interpreted and understood in a contemporary language. 
Frederik has said about the continuing renewal of the royal house: ‘The danger inherent in the office is of course that one becomes isolated. One has to beware of that. But in our country, the royal family is not at all isolated compared to other countries. Here we can count ourselves lucky that our institution moves with the times. That is main thing: to move with the times. Find out the lie of the land and be influenced by what you find. And shape the institution on that basis.' 
This renewal was also demonstrated by his choice of spouse. Mary Donaldson's parents are commoners. By comparison, in the two preceding generations of the royal house, the Crown Prince's mother in 1967 married a nobleman, a French count of the Monpezat family, while his maternal grandfather in 1935 married the daughter of a Swedish king, the later Queen Ingrid (d.2000), with whom the Crown Prince incidentally had a close relationship. 
This shift away from class considerations in relation to marriage more than anything else reveals the gradual modernisation of the Danish royal house.
On 15 October 2005, the couple had a little prince. On 21 January 2006, he was baptised in Christianborg Palace Church and given the name Christian Valdemar Henri John. The succession is thus secured for two generations. 
On 21 April 2007, the couple had their second child - a little princess. On 1 July 2007, she was baptised in Fredensborg Palace Church and given the name Isabella Henrietta Ingrid Margrethe.
On 8 January 2011, the couple had their third and fourth child - Prince Vincent and princess Josephine.
The couple's popularity in Denmark is huge and extends to circles which have not traditionally shown an interest in the royal house. Already before his marriage, the Crown Prince was voted Dane of the Year several times. The couple have mastered the difficult art of renewing the monarchy without destroying its mystique. 
At the political level, the royal house is by definition neutral, but in recent years the task has not become easier for the future sovereign, as politics increasingly impinge on the area of moral values. So far, the Crown Prince has however managed to adopt an open style, for instance with his statement that he would like to be the king of an increasingly multicultural nation. 
Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary live partly at Amalienborg, the royal family's residence in Copenhagen, partly at the Chancellery at Frederiksborg Castle in Northern Zealand, which for generations has been the Danish royal family's summer residence.

Queen Margrethe was born on 16 April 1940 as the eldest daughter of King Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid.
Mary Elizabeth Donaldson was born on 5 February 1972 in Hobart, the main town on Tasmania, which is part of Australia.
The Danish monarchy is constitutional, which means that the monarch cannot independently perform political acts.
The direct lines of the ancient Danish dynasty became extinct with the death of Christoffer III in 1448.
The Danish crown jewels, the symbols of the monarchy, consist of the crown, the sceptre, the orb, and the sword of state and the ampulla.

Australian-born Crown Princess Mary of Denmark gave birth to twins on January 8, 2011, at Copenhagen's Rigshospitalet. The royal twins were christened in mid-April 2011 and given the names Vincent Frederik Minik Alexander and Josefine Sofia Ivalo Mathilda.
The twins, a boy and a girl, are brother and sister to Princes Christian, born in 2005, and Princess Isabella, born in 2007.
In a fairy-tale romance which had its beginnings in the heady days of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, Australian-born Mary Donaldson became Crown Princess of Denmark at her wedding to Danish Crown Prince Frederik on May 14, 2004. 
The wedding was held in the Copenhagen cathedral Vor Frue Kirke (Church of Our Lady) at 4pm central European summer time. 
Copenhagen Bishop Erik Norman Svendsen officiated at the wedding rites, assisted by the chaplain to the Royal Family, Professor Christian Thodberg. 
Australian Governor General Michael Jeffery and Mrs Marlena Jeffery represented Australia at the wedding. The wedding celebrations included performances by Australian musicians and bands, the serving of Australian food and wine, and a yacht race between Australian and Danish yachtsmen with Prince Frederik on board the Danish yacht and Mary Donaldson on an Australian-crewed yacht. The Aussie touch At the start of the week-long celebrations leading to the May 14 wedding, Mary Donaldson's favorite Australian rock band, Powderfinger, performed at a concert attended by the royal couple. At least 18 Danish bands performed at the concert. On Saturday night, May 8, the Australian Governor General hosted dinner for the royal couple and their families at Fredensborg Store Kro Hotel. Sydney chef Luke Mangan, who prepared the dinner fare, flew in from Australia the dinner ingredients of barramundi from the Northern Territory, salmon from Tasmania, kingfish from South Australia, prawns from New South Wales, and lamb from Victoria. Entertainment was provided by Sydney's Tankstream Quartet. The group also plays at the wedding reception on Friday night. Sunday saw the Australia versus the Vikings best-of-three yacht race in the port of Copenhagen. America's Cup winning skipper John Bertrand was at the helm of the yacht Song crewed by Australians including Mary Donaldson. The Crown Prince was on the Danish-crewed Sjaelsoe. And the winner? Song, with the future Crown Princess on board, won the race. On Wednesday, Tasmania's Derwent Valley Concert Band played at a reception for the royal couple at Copenhagen City Hall.
After the Vor Frue Kirke wedding rites, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Denmark rode in an open ceremonial carriage drawn by six white horses - through a sea of Danish and Australian flags waved by crowds lining the streets - to Christian VII's Palace in central Copenhagen. There, on the balcony of the royal palace, the couple had their first public kiss to the cheers of the crowd at Amalienborg Square. The reception was held at Fredensborg Palace, attended by royalty from many parts of the world and representatives of government. Crown Princess Mary is Princess not only of Denmark but also of Greenland and the Faroe Islands. She has become a Danish citizen and a convert to the Lutheran Church.
Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary were in Australia in late February and early March 2005 on their first official royal visit to Princess Mary's country of birth.
At 1.57am on October 15, 2005, Copenhagen local time, Crown Princess Mary of Denmark gave birth at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen (Copenhagen University Hospital) to a son and future king of Denmark. The little prince, the first child of Australian-born Mary and Danish Crown Prince Frederik was christened Christian Valdemar Henri John in Christiansborg Palace Church, Copenhagen, just after 11.30am, January 21, 2006, central European time.
Crown Princess Mary gave birth to a daughter at 4.02pm, April 21, 2007, Copenhagen local time, at Rigshospitalet, the same hospital where Prince Christian was born.
How it all began On October 8, 2003, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark officially announced the engagement of Australian Mary Donaldson and Danish Crown Prince Frederik. Tasmanian-born Mary Donaldson met the Prince of Denmark during the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. The Prince was in Australia with the Danish sailing team. They met at the Slip Inn Bar in Sydney following the Olympic opening ceremony on September 15, 2000. Six months later, reports emerged from Denmark that an Australian had captured the Prince's heart. The "mystery woman" was later identified as Mary Donaldson. Mary Donaldson visited Denmark for the first time in December 2001. By January 2002 Prince Frederik had confirmed the relationship and Mary Donaldson started taking lessons in language, Danish history and etiquette. In April 2003, Mary Donaldson was formally presented to Queen Margrethe who gave, in August, the first sign of approval of her son and heir's engagement. On October 8, the Queen officially approved the marriage, and the wedding date was set.
