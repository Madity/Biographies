This article is about the Barbadian singer.  For her book, see Rihanna (book).  For persons of the similar given name, see Rhianna.
Robyn Rihanna Fenty (born February 20, 1988), better known by her stage name Rihanna (/riˈɑːnə/ ree-AH-nə or /riˈænə/ ree-AN-ə),[4] is a Barbadian recording artist, actress, and fashion designer. She was born in Saint Michael, Barbados; her career began when she met record producer Evan Rogers through mutual friends in late 2003 and recorded demo tapes under Rogers's guidance. Her tape was sent to several record labels, and she subsequently signed a contract with Def Jam Recordings after auditioning for its then-president, rapper Jay-Z. Her debut album, Music of the Sun (2005) and its follow-up A Girl Like Me (2006) both peaked in the top ten on the US Billboard 200 chart. The albums spawned the US Billboard Hot 100 top two hit single "Pon de Replay" and her first Hot 100 number-one on the chart, "SOS".
Her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), and its chart-topping lead single "Umbrella" were major breakthroughs in her career that brought her to widespread prominence. The album and its 2008 Reloaded version further produced the worldwide hit singles "Don't Stop the Music", "Take a Bow", and "Disturbia". The record was nominated for nine Grammy Awards, winning Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for "Umbrella". Following a highly publicized altercation with then-boyfriend, entertainer Chris Brown, she released her fourth studio album, Rated R, in November 2009. It was followed by three more albums: Loud (2010), Talk That Talk (2011), and her first Billboard 200 number one album Unapologetic (2012). That same year, she appeared in her first theatrical feature film, Battleship.
She has sold more than 30 million albums and 120 million singles worldwide, making her one of the best-selling artists of all time.[5] Many of her songs rank among the world's best-selling singles of all time, such as "Umbrella", "Take a Bow", "Disturbia", "Only Girl (In the World)", "S&M", "We Found Love", "Diamonds" and "Stay". In addition to her solo work, Rihanna has collaborated with numerous other artists, including being featured on the worldwide hits "Live Your Life" (with T.I.), "Run This Town" (with Jay-Z and Kanye West), "Love the Way You Lie" and "The Monster" (both with Eminem). She has achieved thirteen number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming the youngest and fastest solo artist to achieve the feat. Billboard named her the Digital Songs Artist of the 2000s decade and the top Hot 100 artist of the 2010s decade.[6][7][8]
Rihanna is known for consistently reinventing her style and image, most notably since Good Girl Gone Bad.[9][10] Her work has earned her numerous awards and accolades, including seven Grammy Awards,[1] eight American Music Awards, 22 Billboard Music Awards, and two BRIT Awards. In 2012, Forbes ranked her the fourth most powerful celebrity of the year, with earnings of $53 million between May 2011 and May 2012. The same year, TIME named Rihanna one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. At the American Music Awards of 2013, she received the first ever Icon Award. On June 2, 2014, Rihanna received Fashion Icon lifetime achievement award from Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA).[11]
Robyn Rihanna Fenty was born on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados. Her mother is Monica Braithwaite, a retired Afro-Guyanese accountant, and her father is Ronald Fenty, a warehouse supervisor of Barbadian and Irish descent.[12][13] Rihanna has two brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty, and two half-sisters and a half-brother from her father's side, each born to different mothers from his previous relationships.[14][15] She grew up in a three-bedroom bungalow in Bridgetown and sold clothes with her father in a stall on the street. Rihanna's childhood was deeply affected by her father's addiction to crack cocaine and alcohol. Her parents divorced when she was 14.[13][16] Rihanna grew up listening to reggae music and began singing at around the age of seven.[14][17] She attended Charles F. Broome Memorial Primary School and Combermere High School, where she formed a musical trio with two of her classmates.[14] Rihanna was an army cadet in a sub-military programme; the singer-songwriter Shontelle was her drill sergeant.[18] Although she initially wanted to graduate from high school, she chose to pursue a musical career instead.[19]
In December 2003, Rihanna met vacationing music producer Evan Rogers through mutual friends in Barbados.[20] Rogers heard about Rihanna's singing ability and asked her to come to his hotel room to audition for him, where she performed renditions of the songs "Emotion" and "Hero".[21] This impressed Rogers, who then took Rihanna and her mother to his home in Connecticut to record some demo tapes. Rihanna was signed to Rogers' and Sturken's production company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions, which assigned her a lawyer and manager. In late 2004, her four-song demo tape was distributed to several labels, including Def Jam Recordings.[21] Jay Brown, an A&R executive at Def Jam, came across Rihanna's demo and played it for then-president and CEO of Def Jam, Jay-Z.[22] Despite being skeptical about Rihanna, Jay-Z invited her to audition for the label.[23] In February 2005, she traveled to New York to audition for Jay-Z and industry executive L.A. Reid, performing Whitney Houston's version of "For the Love of You" and the original songs "Pon de Replay" and "The Last Time".[21][24] To prevent her from potentially signing with another label, she was signed on the spot to a six-album record deal with Def Jam.[21][25]
Rihanna spent the next three months collaborating with rapper Memphis Bleek on his fourth studio album 534 and recording her debut album.[23] Her album featured production from Rogers, Sturken, StarGate and Poke & Tone.[26] Her debut single, "Pon de Replay", charted successfully worldwide, peaking in the top five in fifteen countries, including at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart.[27] Her debut album, Music of the Sun, was released in August 2005. It debuted at number ten on the Billboard 200 and received a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of over 500,000 units.[28] The album sold over two million copies worldwide. It received mixed reviews; Rolling Stone gave it two and a half out of five stars and described as lacking replay value, ingenuity, and rhythm.[29] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described the album as a "glut of teen R&B chanteuses" and described her lead single as "a dancehall-pop mixture that owes plenty of its sweat and shimmy to Beyoncé's "Baby Boy".[26] A second single, "If It's Lovin' that You Want", was not as successful as its predecessor, but reached the top ten in Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand.[30] Besides music Rihanna made her acting debut in a cameo role in the straight-to-DVD film Bring It On: All or Nothing, released in August 2006.[31]
A month after the release of her debut album, Rihanna began working on her second studio album.[32] Rogers, Sturken, StarGate, J. R. Rotem and label-mate singer-songwriter Ne-Yo worked on the production and writing of the album.[33] A Girl Like Me was released in April 2006.[34] Critical response to the album was mixed; Rolling Stone commented, "Like her filler-packed debut album, this similar but superior follow-up doesn't deliver anything else as ingenious as its lead single."[35] The album was a commercial success, charting in the top ten in thirteen countries. The album reached number one in Canada and number five in the United Kingdom and United States, where it sold 115,000 copies its first week.[28][36] Its lead single, "SOS", was an international success, charting in the top five in eleven countries, including Canada, Germany, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The song reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and in Australia, her first to reach this chart position.[37] "Unfaithful", the album's second single, reached the top ten in eighteen countries, including number one in Canada and Switzerland.[38] "We Ride" and "Break It Off", the latter featuring Sean Paul, were also released as singles.[39][40] Following the release of the album, Rihanna embarked on her first headlining tour, the Rihanna: Live in Concert Tour, also performing alongside Jay-Z and Ne-Yo on the Rock Tha Block Tour. In addition, she joined The Pussycat Dolls on their PCD World Tour.
For her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad, Rihanna embraced a new musical direction through uptempo dance tracks produced by Timbaland, will.i.am and Sean Garrett.[41][42] Released in May 2007, the album charted at number two in Australia and the US and topped the charts in multiple countries, including Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Japan, Russia and the UK.[43] The album received the most positive critical reviews of her first three albums.[44] The lead single, "Umbrella", topped the charts in thirteen countries and remained number one in the UK for ten consecutive weeks, the longest-running number one single since Wet Wet Wet's single "Love Is All Around" spent fifteen weeks at the top in 1994.[45][46] It was Rihanna's first single to be named one of the best-selling singles worldwide, with sales of over 6.6 million copies.[47][48] The songs "Shut Up and Drive", "Hate That I Love You" featuring Ne-Yo, and "Don't Stop The Music" were also released as singles. In support of the album, she began the Good Girl Gone Bad Tour in September 2007, with 80 shows across the US, Canada, and Europe.[49] Rihanna was nominated for several 2008 Grammy Awards, winning Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for "Umbrella" alongside Jay-Z.[50]
Throughout 2008, Rihanna performed on the Glow in the Dark Tour alongside Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, and N.E.R.D.[51] Her third studio album's reissue, Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded, was released in June 2008 with three new songs: "Disturbia", "Take a Bow", and the Maroon 5 duet "If I Never See Your Face Again". All three were released as singles and charted highly, reaching peak positions worldwide.[52][53][54] In August 2008, Rihanna and a host of other female singers, including Beyoncé, Mary J. Blige, and Mariah Carey, recorded the charity single "Just Stand Up!", the theme song to the anti-cancer campaign Stand Up to Cancer.[55] "Live Your Life", a duet between T.I. and Rihanna, released that November, peaked in the top ten in thirteen countries worldwide, topping the Billboard Hot 100. A remix album, Good Girl Gone Bad: The Remixes, was released in January 2009. Good Girl Gone Bad has sold over 2.8 million units in the United States alone, receiving a two-times-platinum certification from the RIAA. It is Rihanna's best-selling album in the country to date.[28][56] The album has sold over seven million copies worldwide.[57] By late 2008, Rihanna remained on the charts with her eighth single, "Rehab" and was named "Diva of the Year" by Entertainment Weekly for her "newfound staying power".[58]
In early 2009, Rihanna began working on her fourth studio album, Rated R.[59] Meanwhile, she collaborated with Jay-Z and Kanye West on "Run This Town", the second single from Jay-Z's eleventh studio album The Blueprint 3. The song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and reached the top ten in ten other countries.[60] Rated R was released in November 2009 with Rolling Stone stating that Rihanna "transformed her sound and made one of the best pop records of the year".[61][62] The album's lead single, "Russian Roulette", was a commercial success, reaching number one in Norway and Switzerland and making the top ten in sixteen other countries.[63] This was followed by the release of "Hard" with Young Jeezy and "Rude Boy". The latter was the biggest worldwide success from the album, topping the US Billboard Hot 100 for six weeks and reaching top ten positions in twenty-two other countries.[64][65] Two other singles were released from the album: "Rockstar 101" with Slash and "Te Amo".[66][67] Rated R: Remixed was released in the spring of 2010 and featured ten tracks remixed by Chew Fu.[68] To promote the album, Rihanna embarked on her second worldwide tour, the Last Girl on Earth Tour.[69] At the 52nd Grammy Awards, "Run This Town" won Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.[70]
In summer 2010, Rihanna collaborated with rapper Eminem on "Love the Way You Lie", which was a major worldwide success, reaching number one in over twenty countries.[71] The song was Rihanna's seventh US number one of her career, making her the female artist with the fifth-most number ones in the chart's history.[72] Reaching number two, the song became the biggest-selling song of 2010 in the UK, and the first of Rihanna's singles to sell over one million copies in the country.[73][74] She also lent her vocals to "All of the Lights", a single from Kanye West's album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, alongside John Legend, The-Dream, Elly Jackson, Alicia Keys, Fergie, Kid Cudi, and Elton John.[75] In October 2010, Rihanna switched managers, joining Jay-Z's Roc Nation Management.[76]
Loud, Rihanna's fifth studio album, was released the following month.[77] Its lead single, "Only Girl (In the World)", reached number one in fifteen countries, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[78][79][80] The album's second single, "What's My Name?", featuring Drake, also reached number one in the US and UK, making Rihanna the first female solo artist to have five number one singles on the UK Singles Chart in consecutive years.[81] The song reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 before "Only Girl (In the World)", the first time in the chart's history that an album's lead single reached number one after the second.[82] The third single, "S&M", reached number one on the Hot 100 following the release of its official remix featuring Britney Spears, becoming her tenth number one single, which tied her with Janet Jackson for fourth place among female soloists who have topped the chart. With only four years, eleven months, and two weeks between her first and tenth number one on the chart, Rihanna set a record as the solo artist with the fastest accumulation of ten chart toppers.[83] "Man Down" and "California King Bed" were released as singles in May 2011 with moderate success.[84][85] "Cheers (Drink to That)", which interpolates Avril Lavigne's 2002 single "I'm with You", was released as the sixth and final single from the album, reaching the top twenty in the UK and the top ten in the US.[86] In February 2011, "Only Girl (In the World)" won the award for Best Dance Recording at the 53rd Grammy Awards.[87] To promote the album, Rihanna embarked on her Loud Tour in June 2011, which sold out ten nights at the The O2 Arena in London, the most sold out shows for a female artist in the venue's history.[88][89] The tour was the seventh highest grossing tour worldwide of 2011.[90] The final three shows in London were filmed for Rihanna's second live video album, titled Loud Tour Live at the O2, which was released on December 18, 2012.[91][92] In October 2011, Nicki Minaj released the collaboration "Fly", featuring Rihanna.[93][94]
Rihanna's sixth album, Talk That Talk, was released in November 2011.[95] The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 with sales of 198,000 copies[96] and number one in the UK, selling 163,000. The lead single, "We Found Love", topped charts in twenty-seven countries worldwide, peaking in the top ten in thirty countries and breaking many records worldwide.[97] It topped the Billboard Hot 100 for ten non-consecutive weeks, becoming Rihanna's longest-running number one single and the longest-running number one of 2011.[98][99] The song was later named the 24th biggest hit of all time on the Billboard Hot 100.[4] "You Da One" and the titular track featuring Jay-Z were released as the second and third singles from the album to moderate success, the former reaching the top twenty in the UK and US.[100][101] "Where Have You Been", the fifth single, successfully charted worldwide, reaching number five in the US and six in the UK.[102][103] "Cockiness (Love It)" was released as the album's sixth and final single in a remixed form featuring rapper ASAP Rocky.[104]
In early 2012, two collaborations featuring Rihanna were released: Coldplay's "Princess of China" from the album Mylo Xyloto and Drake's "Take Care" from his album of the same name.[105][106] In February 2012, Rihanna won her third Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 2012 Grammy Awards, and was voted the Best International Female Solo Artist at the 2012 BRIT Awards for the second consecutive year.[107][108] March 2012 saw the simultaneous release of collaborations between Rihanna and Chris Brown: remixes of her song "Birthday Cake" and his "Turn Up the Music". The recordings received mainly negative responses due to the pair's history of domestic violence.[109] In September 2012, "We Found Love" won the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year, making Rihanna the first woman to receive the accolade more than once.[110] Rihanna starred as Petty Officer (GM2) Cora Raikes in her first theatrical feature film Battleship, which was released on May 18, 2012.[111] Loosely based on the game of the same name, both the film and Rihanna's performance received mixed-to-negative reviews; The New York Times said she was "just fine in the rather generic role".[112] She received a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress[113] and, on a more positive note, a Teen Choice Award.[114] She appeared in Katy Perry: Part of Me, a 3D autobiographical documentary-concert film about her friend Katy Perry. On August 19, 2012, Rihanna appeared in the first episode of the second season of Oprah Winfrey's American prime time television show Oprah's Next Chapter.[115] The episode scored the second-highest ratings in the history of the Oprah Winfrey Network.[116]
Rihanna's seventh studio album, Unapologetic, was released in November 2012.[117] In the United States, the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of 238,000, marking Rihanna's first number one album in the country. In addition, it was the best-selling debut week of her career, besting her fifth studio album Loud (2010).[118] The album was Rihanna's third consecutive number one album in the United Kingdom and fifth in Switzerland.[119][120] The lead single from the album, "Diamonds", reached number one in more than twenty countries worldwide, including on the US Billboard Hot 100, her twelfth number one on the chart which tied her with Madonna and The Supremes as the artists' with the fourth most number ones on the chart's history.[121] The album's second single, "Stay", featuring Mikky Ekko, reached the top five in over twenty countries, including number three on the Billboard Hot 100.[122] "Pour It Up" was released as the second U.S. single and third overall, reaching number 19 on the Hot 100.[123] An official remix featuring American rappers Young Jeezy, Rick Ross, Juicy J, and T.I. was later distributed.[124] "Right Now" featuring David Guetta serves as the fourth single from the album and peaked at number fifty on the Hot 100.[123] As promotion prior to the album's release, Rihanna embarked on the 777 Tour, a mini tour of seven shows in seven countries in seven days.[125] A documentary DVD of the tour was later released.
In February 2013 at the 55th Grammy Awards, Rihanna won her sixth Grammy Award, in the category Best Short Form Music Video for "We Found Love" (2011).[126] Also that month, the Official Charts Company announced that Rihanna had sold 3,868,000 records in the past year in the UK alone, ranking at number one in the list of 2013 BRIT Awards artist nominees.[119] Rihanna's fifth headlining concert tour, the Diamonds World Tour, began in March 2013 in support of Unapologetic.[127] Rihanna appeared in the Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg comedy film This Is the End, released in June 2013.[128] That same month, American hip hop artist Wale released a remixed version of his single "Bad" featuring Rihanna.[129] In October 2013, Eminem released his Rihanna-assisted single, "The Monster", the fourth release from his eighth studio album The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013). With the song entering the UK Singles Chart at number one, Rihanna joined Elvis Presley and The Beatles as just one of three acts to have scored a number one single each year over seven consecutive years in the chart's history.[130] The song also peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, which marked Rihanna's thirteenth chart topper, tying her with Michael Jackson for the third most number ones in the chart's 55 year history. Additionally, Rihanna became the fastest solo artist to achieve 13 number ones, surpassing the previous record held by Mariah Carey (seven-years, eight-months and 19 days), with only The Beatles reaching the tally more quickly.[131]
In December 2013, rapper Pitbull revealed during an interview that the featured artist on his song "Timber" was originally supposed to be Rihanna. However, he stated that she was already asked to be the featured artist on the lead single from Shakira's upcoming album and did not have time to record the track.[132] This single, "Can't Remember to Forget You", was released as the first single from Shakira's self-titled tenth studio album on January 13, 2014.[133]
That same month, it was announced that Rihanna had started planning her eighth studio album. She is working with producers such as DJ Mustard, David Guetta, Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins and Nicky Romero.[134][135][136] On February 25, 2014, CEO of DreamWorks Animation, Jeffrey Katzenberg, announced that Rihanna will release a concept album based around the upcoming 3D animated film Home,[137] which she also stars in alongside Steve Martin and Jennifer Lopez. In May 2014, Rihanna left Def Jam to sign fully with Roc Nation who had managed her since October 2010.[138]
"Pon de Replay" is infused with a reggae style using a mixture of dance-pop and R&B. Lyrically, the song is about Rihanna asking the DJ to play her favorite song repeatedly.
While recording tracks for her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), Rihanna took vocal lessons from Ne-Yo. Speaking of the experience she stated, "I've never had vocal training, so when I'm in the studio, he'll tell me how to breathe and stuff... He'll call out these big fancy words: 'OK, I want you to do staccato.' And I'm like, 'OK, I don't know what that is.'"[42] Her vocal performance on Loud (2010) received positive reviews from music critics. James Skinner from BBC praised Rihanna's vocals on the song "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" and wrote that her voice is powerful and that "it is Rihanna’s vocal – at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable – that anchors the song, and Loud itself".[139] Andy Gill from The Independent feels that "California King Bed" features her best vocal performance.[140] In a review of Unapologetic, Billboard magazine wrote, "Diamonds finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date, on this inspirational pop ballad."[141] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times stated, "over the years, as her game face froze in place, her voice cured into a weapon of emotional chill and strategic indifference. It’s decidedly unfriendly, made to give orders".[142] Volume 65 of the Contemporary Black Biography book series notes that "Rihanna is the rare rhythm and blues diva to emerge from the Caribbean world."[143]
At the time of her debut, she was marketed as a reggae singer because of her Caribbean descent.[144] She began recording songs that were inspired by caribbean music genres such as soca, dancehall, and reggae. She later departed into a broad range of musical genres such as dance-pop, hip hop, dubstep, rock, and house.[145] Some of her songs are also inspired through samples, containing samples from other artists.[146] The combination of dancehall and reggae genres on her debut album, Music of the Sun (2005), was complemented by Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times, who said, "Dancehall reggae sometimes seems like a furiously insular form of music, but ... Rihanna is only the latest singer to discover how versatile the genre's spring-loaded electronic rhythms can be".[147] Her debut album featured production from Stargate and production duo Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers, who discovered her and helped launch her career with her debut single "Pon de Replay".[42] For her second studio album, A Girl Like Me (2006), Rihanna stuck with her Caribbean roots but also infuse a bit of rock music with the track "Kisses Don't Lie".[148] The ballads on the album were described as elegant and mature, showing artistic growth.[149]
With Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), she wanted to record uptempo songs, departing from her Caribbean sound of her early releases, while working with new producers such as Timbaland, Sean Garrett, and Christopher Stewart, who produced the international hit "Umbrella", a major breakthrough.[150][151] "[At] this stage I feel like I want to do a lot of uptempo [songs] ... but still be soulful at the same time", she said.[42] Recorded after the assault by her then-boyfriend, Chris Brown, Rated-R (2009) had a much darker tone and was filled with various emotions she experienced throughout 2009.[152] Released in 2010, Loud reflects on the fun and energetic attitude she had while recording the album.[153] The album is a mixture of ballads, party anthems, and empowering love songs.[154] Talk That Talk (2011) was similar to Rated R, as both contain hip hop, R&B, dancehall, and dubstep genres.[155] Loud and Talk That Talk also saw her return to her dancehall roots, evident in the tracks like "Man Down" and "Watch n' Learn".[156] She also branched out into house music with tracks like "We Found Love", "Only Girl (In the World)" and "Complicated."[157]
Rihanna has named Madonna as her idol and biggest influence. She said she wants to be the "black Madonna".[158][159] "I think that Madonna was a great inspiration for me, especially on my earlier work. If I had to examine her evolution through time, I think she reinvented her clothing style and music with success every single time. And at the same time remained a real force in entertainment in the whole world."[158] She also cites Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey as major influences and idols.[160][161] Of Janet Jackson, Rihanna has commented that "[s]he was one of the first female pop icons that I could relate to."[162] Rihanna has said the late R&B singer Aaliyah has a huge impact on her style and also complimented on the singers artistry as well.[163] Rihanna was inspired to start her career after watching Beyoncé on television with Destiny's Child.[164]
Rihanna commented that Marilyn Monroe and vintage clothing served as visual inspiration for the music video "Hate That I Love You" and "Rehab". The "dark, creepy" scenes of "Disturbia" have been compared to Michael Jackson's Thriller.[165][166] Other musical influences include Alicia Keys,[167] Fefe Dobson,[168][169] Celine Dion,[170] Brandy,[171] and Gwen Stefani.[172] Jon Bream of the Star Tribune commented "[i]n the tradition of Madonna and Janet Jackson, Rihanna has become the video vixen of the '00s ... Rihanna has perfected the pout, the long-legged strut and trend-setting hairdos that keep women and men alike checking her out on YouTube."[165] George Epaminondas of InStyle considers Rihanna's music videos to be "cinematic" due to her "blend of lush island rhythms and swinging pop and ... mischievous sensuality."[173]
Rihanna's music contains strong influences of Caribbean music, including reggae and dancehall.[174] The video for "Rude Boy" was inspired by her Caribbean roots.[174] She stated that while growing up in Barbados she listened to reggae music, and when she came to the United States she was exposed to many different types of music.[175] Rihanna is heavily influenced by the Jamaican singer-songwriter Bob Marley. She stated, "[h]e's one of my favorite artists of all time [...] he really paved the way for every other artist out of the Caribbean".[176] She built a shrine in her home dedicated to Marley.[177] Rihanna has covered Marley's "Is This Love" and Bob Marley & The Wailers' "Redemption Song".[178]
Rihanna has worked with music video director Anthony Mandler on more than a dozen music videos, the first being "Unfaithful" (2006).[179] "We've done 16 videos together; they're not all tough, [...] Yeah, I mean, I'm known for the 'Disturbia's and the 'Russian Roulette's and things like that, but 'Only Girl (In the World)' is certainly an ethereal kind of empowering, beauty-filled video," Mandler said.[179] Jocelyn Vena of MTV wrote, "Rihanna, like Madonna, also has a tendency to make truly thought-provoking music videos that fit the songs they represent. Smattered in between glitzier, more glamorous clips, Madge and Ri want us to think about bigger issues".[157] "Unfaithful", "Love The Way You Lie", "Man Down", and "We Found Love" were shot as short films exploring issues such as love triangles, abuse, and substance abuse romance.[157] Her music video for "Umbrella" shows Rihanna's transition into adulthood and her newly adopted image.[180] Tamar Anitai from MTV Buzzworthy listed "Disturbia" at number five on the "Buzzworthy's Top 5 Most Paranoid Music Videos". He said that "Paranoia never looked so supernaturally sexy!".[181] The video for "Russian Roulette" features Rihanna in a padded room playing a game of russian roulette with her partner. A scene of Rihanna being approached by a speeding car at night was compared to the altercation with Chris Brown.[182] The Caribbean-inspired music video for "Rude Boy" was compared to rapper M.I.A.'s video "Boyz" by many critics for its colorful aesthetic similarities.[174]
In 2011, Rihanna released three controversial music videos about sadomasochism, rape, and domestic violence. The video for "S&M" was banned in eleven countries for its sexual content.[183] "Man Down", which features Rihanna shooting a man in a train station, was criticized by the Parents Television Council.[184] "We Found Love", which shows Rihanna and her love interest in a drug-filled unhealthy relationship,[182] sparked criticism from the Rape Crisis Centre for its inappropriate message.[185] Charne Graham of the Houston Press stated, "Why should Rihanna's music videos get everyone riled up when others' equally sexual and controversial videos are in rotation?" He added, "she just like to make music videos that give us something to talk about".[186] Rihanna is the first woman to pass two billion cumulative views on the music video website VEVO.[187] As of September 2013, she has accumulated over four billion views on the site.[188]
Denis Armstrong of Canadian Online Explorer commented on her performance at the Ottawa Bluesfest, saying "her show was a Disney-esque choreographed fantasy of non-stop hip-swiveling, sassy attitude and personal endearments and a string of funky, sugar-free hits."[189] Her performance of "Disturbia" at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards was ranked tenth best on the MTV Video Music Awards, according to a Billboard poll.[190] Her revealing leather costumes during her Good Girl Gone Bad Tour were highly criticized by Malaysia's conservative Islamic party, who recommended that her concert tour should be banned.[191] Whilst commenting on her third album's accompanying tour, The Times compared Rihanna's stage wardrobe styling to that of Janet Jackson and called her "a vision of Ann Summers couture in thigh-high boots and a few scraps of black PVC."[192] In the October 2011 issue of British Vogue, Rihanna said her performance outfits and appearances are all an act; "[t]hat’s not me. That’s a part I play. You know, like it’s a piece of art, with all these toys and textures to play with".[193]
In 2009, New York magazine described Rihanna's early look as that of a cookie-cutter teen queen, noting she has the ability to shift looks dramatically and with great ease.[194] Around the time of the release of her second studio album, A Girl Like Me (2006), many critics felt that Rihanna's style, sound, and musical material were too similar to those of Beyoncé.[195][196] In an interview with Look magazine, Rihanna spoke about comparisons to Beyonce: "Beyoncé is a great artist and I feel honored to be mentioned in the same sentence, but we're different performers with different styles".[197] In 2007, Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by Charlize Theron's bob cut in the science fiction thriller Æon Flux (2005).[198] That same year she was tagged Venus Breeze's "Celebrity Legs of a Goddess" by Gillette.[199]
Known for reinventing her style and image, she has changed her personal appearance several times, scoring different hairstyles since the release of her third album.[9][10] When putting together her own wardrobe she stated, "It's become more about taking a risk [...] I always look for the most interesting silhouette or something that's a little off."[200] Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian wrote that "Rihanna's wardrobe is the most talked-about, influential and dissected in pop right now" and that whatever she wears "is immediately reproduced on the high street, because it sells".[201] However, her style evolution has been criticized by many critics for its strong message and revealing outfits.[202] People listed her second on its "10 Best Dressed Stars of 2008" list.[203] Country singer Miranda Lambert admires Rihanna's fashion and style. "I don’t necessarily get inspired by the whole no-bra thing, but I love that you never know what she’s going to wear. It always keeps you guessing, which makes her sassy and interesting."[204] Commenting on the cultural expectation for pop stars to be role models, she said "[being a role model] became more of my job than I wanted it to be. But no, I just want to make music. That's it".[193] In a May 2013 interview with MTV, The Vagina Monologues writer and feminist Eve Ensler praised the singer, saying, "I'm a huge Rihanna fan, I think she has a kind of agency over her sexuality and she's open about her sexuality, she has enormous grace and she's immensely talented."[205]
Despite being recognized for her sex appeal, she revealed being a sex symbol is not a priority and that "it’s definitely flattering, but also uncomfortable."[206] Emily Hewett from Metro wrote, "Rihanna is quite possibly THE most sexiest woman in the world. The 25-year-old songbird can grind like no other, pull off a provocative pose better than a Playboy pro."[207] Her appearance has landed her on the cover of magazines such as Maxim, FHM, Rolling Stone and GQ.[208] She has appeared in the top ten on Maxim's Hot 100 list and on FHM's "100 Sexiest Women in the World" several times.[209][210] In 2009, Glamour ranked her at number 17 on the 50 Most Glamorous Women and Esquire named her the Sexiest Woman Alive of 2011.[211][212] In December 2012, Rihanna became the first woman to be featured on the cover of GQ magazine’s "Men of the Year" issue and ranked fifth on Complex list of "100 Hottest Female Singers of All Time".[208][213] The following year, VH1 placed Rihanna second on their list of "100 Sexiest Artists".[214]

      I love the high-risk (guys). I don't like cream puff, corny guys. Usually they are the nice guys, the ones that won't hurt you. They'll pull out the chair for you and the whole nine yards. Everything is perfect and boring. I like the risk, I like the edge. That's the thrill for me.
      I love flirting at the moment. I'm single and I'm enjoying my freedom. But I don't give my phone number out that often. But if I'm dating, I check the boy from the top to the bottom.
      [on what a man needs to impress her] He has to be good in bed and the size matters. You know what I mean? The inner beauty counts as well, but without a toy it doesn't make it fun.
      [on her musical sound change] Everyone was really surprised when i started liking new things and changing my image. I was 16 when i was signed and i'm 22 now. My musical taste and image is going to change naturally. It's not forced, i do what comes natural to me. Sometimes i like to be dark... other times i like to be really light and lady-like.
      [on size zero models] Being a size zero is a career in itself so we shouldn't try and be like them, it is not realistic and it is not healthy. You shouldn't be pressured into trying to be thin by the fashion industry, because they only want models that are like human mannequins. They know that if we see an outfit on a mannequin in a shop window we will love it and want to buy it whatever size we are. That's why they have size zero models - they want to sell clothes. But you have to remember that it's not practical or possible for an everyday woman to look like that."
      [on Homophobia] I know that a large part of my fanbase is gay. They've shown me love from the start. I mean in this industry, everyone from my glam people to my dancers are gay. You can't be homophobic in this line of work, i'm a popstar! It hurts me when i read fan mail from a fan who have been called names for liking me.
      My weight fluctuates, but I don't weigh myself every day. I'm 5ft 8in and weigh around 9st 7lb.
      [on Cheryl Cole] I think she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. Like, how do you have a face like that, with hair like that and dimples, and a body like that, that's proportioned like that? And you have a successful career, something about that is not right.
      [on Russell Brand] I first met him when he was interviewing me on TV. I was sick and it was the worst interview I have ever done... Nothing was funny to me. I thought it was the most stupid interview I ever did in my life. Why am I talking to this idiot? He made me want to throw up again.
      I spend more time over there (in London) than I spend in L.A., and that's where I live. London is more like my home.
      [on doing a duet with Katy Perry] We're actually working on some music together - hell yeah. I would love to tour with Katy. She's a rock star. And when I see her live, she just brings such a fun vibe, like a colorful rock star.
      [on planning Katy Perry's bachelorette party] I have to come up with something cool, because she's getting married in India. So I'm like, 'OK, now what do I do to match that?' That's at the end of the year, so we've got some time to plan that.
      [on Katy Perry] When I first met her, her personality was so on point, I felt like she had no edit button, she was really fun and had a great sense of humor.
      [on missing her friend, Katy Perry's wedding] I will never ever forgive myself for that, it was a crazy time, it was a crazy week. I'm switching management. I'm really sad that I missed it.
      [on having children] I don't really plan on the age. It could be a year from now. It could be 10 years from now. Whenever is right. I mean, I have a lot of other stuff to accomplish before I get to kids. Whenever the time is right, I'll just know. If I had a girl, she'd probably be really rebellious. She would be like a bundle of karma. I would love to bring them up in Barbados.
      I definitely think a child deserves both parents. It would be selfish of me, because of my pride and independence to say, 'Oh, I just want a sperm donor, because I can do it myself.' I can do it myself, but that's not fair. I'm just saying that whatever comes my way I'll be able to handle it, but in a perfect book, there would be marriage and kids.
      (jokingly responding when being questioned about a rumored relationship) I hate to burst your bubble but I'm dating girls!
      [on collaborating with Britney Spears]: I asked my fans last week who they wanted me to collaborate with, and Britney was one of the most popular names. It's very strange because Britney never does features. It was really amazing that she really wanted to be part of this song. She really liked the song to begin with, but it was a different story when she had to sing it, and she really wanted to be a part of it. So it made it really, really special, because you never see two pop female artists doing songs together any more. Just call us 'R&B'.
      [on Chris Brown] It's incredible to see how he pulled out of it the way he did. Even when the world seemed like it was against him, you know? I really like the music he's putting out. I'm a fan of his stuff. I've always been a fan. Obviously, I had some resentment toward him for a while, for obvious reasons. But I've put that behind me. It was taking up too much of my time. It was too much anger. I'm really excited to see the breakthrough he's had in his career. I would never wish anything horrible for him. Never. I never have. (2011).
      I think that Madonna was a great inspiration for me, especially on my earlier work. If I had to examine her evolution through time, I think she reinvented her clothing style and music with success every single time. And at the same time remained a real force in entertainment in the whole world.
      [on recording music with Chris Brown in 2012] I reached out to him about doing 'Birthday Cake' because that's the only person that really - it made sense to do the record. Just as a musician - despite everything else - that was going to be the person. You know I thought about rappers, and I've done that so many times, and the hottest R&B artist out right now is Chris Brown. So I wanted him on the track, and then in turn he was like 'Why don't you do the remix to my track?' and it was a trade off. We did two records. One for my fans. One for his fans, and that way our fans can come together. There shouldn't be a divide. You know? It's music, and it's innocent.
      [on her weight loss in 2012] The Five Factor Diet has gone straight out the window ever since I went on tour. I mean, It's difficult to have any kind of routine when your schedule is that crazy. So I really have no idea how I'm continuously losing weight. It's actually pretty annoying, because now I don't have a butt, and I have no boobs. I already had no boobs to start with. So annoying! and I'm eating everything! (March, 2012)
      [on some people criticizing her reunion with Chris Brown after the two recorded music together in 2012] I respect what other people have to say. The bottom line is that everyone thinks differently. It's very hard for me to accept, but I get it. People end up wasting their time on the blogs or whatever, ranting away, and that's all right. I don't hate them for it. Because tomorrow I'm still going to be the same person. I'm still going to do what I want to do.
      [when asked if she is at ease posing in revealing clothing] Totally, especially when it's Photoshopped. I'm comfortable in my underwear around the right people.
      When people call me Robyn, my head just flies around because I feel like that person knows me. But Rihanna, that tends to be people's own [creation]. Robyn is who I am. Rihanna - that's an idea of who I am.
      [on her style icon] You know who is the best who ever did it? Princess Diana. She was like - she killed it. Every look was right. She was gangster with her clothes. She had these crazy hats. She got over-size jackets. I loved everything she wore!

"The best thing about going without makeup is that it takes a lot less time to get ready," Rihanna tells PEOPLE. "You feel comfortable and free." The glowing singer is also listed at No. 8 on Maxim's Hot 100 and No. 59 on EW's 100 Stars We Love, among such up-and-comers as Hayden Panettiere and Shia LaBeouf.

It features songs produced by Timbaland, cameos by Jay-Z and has a track, "Rehab," written for her by Justin Timberlake.

With the global album release of Loud in November 2010, Rihanna continues her journey to dominate popular music and fashion worldwide.  Loud’s first two singles, “What’s My Name” (featuring Drake) and “Only Girl (In the World),” were worldwide successes, both solid #1 chart-toppers in the U.S. and UK. “What’s My Name,”  “Only Girl (In the World)” and “S&M” became Rihanna’s 8th, 9th, and 10th #1 Billboard Hot 100 hits, respectively. Rihanna now ranks as the only female artist of the past decade to chart ten #1’s on the Hot 100 as well as the youngest soloist to notch ten Hot 100 #1’s.
In the U.S., Loud debuted with the greatest first week sales of any Rihanna album to date, over 207,000 copies, earning RIAA platinum status by January.  Loud sold over 6.2 million copies worldwide and hit #1 in six international territories  – bringing Rihanna’s total album sales to more than 30 million. She has also logged a phenomenal 100 million digital song sales, a number that is still growing every day.
From her Caribbean roots to the top of the charts, the runways of Paris and Milan and some of the biggest stages in the world, the 23-year-old, Barbados-born beauty has already earned the coveted title of international superstar. In 2005, Def Jam released Rihanna's dynamic debut album, Music of the Sun, which garnered much attention due to the popularity of her highly addictive dancehall-flavored first single, “Pon de Replay.”  A year later, she released her platinum-selling second album A Girl Like Me, featuring the #1 singles “SOS” and “Unfaithful.”  From her breakthrough multi-platinum album A Girl Like Me to her ubiquitous global smash “Umbrella,” in just a few short years, Rihanna helped redefine the path of popular music for a new generation.
With two successful albums under her belt in just two years, Rihanna dropped her third album, the multi-platinum Good Girl Gone Bad, in 2007.  Rated R was released worldwide in November 2009 and the first single, “Russian Roulette” made chart history for Rihanna – as her 12thBillboard Hot 100 career hit.  The next single, “Rude Boy” (the fifth multi-platinum certified song of Rihanna’s career) hit #1 on a slew of charts – including Billboard’s Hot 100 and Hot 100 Airplay, and MediaBase’s Pop, Hot Dance Radio, Hot Dance Clubs, Rhythm, and Urban charts.
Rihanna's extensive accomplishments also include multiple #1 hits, a Grammy for Best Dance Recording for “Only Girl (In The World), ” a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for "Run This Town" and a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for "Umbrella" along with fourteen Grammy nominations, two MTV Video Music Awards, Favorite Pop/Rock & Soul/R&B Female Artist at the American Music Awards, and the European MOBO Award as Best International Act.  In all, Rihanna is the recipient of three Grammy Awards, four American Music and World Music and BET Awards, five People’s Choice and Teen Choice Awards, MTV VMAs from every region, a BRIT Award for Best International Female Artist in 2011 and an amazing 18 Billboard Music Awards.    Rihanna's impressive discography and a growing collection of the music industry's most cherished awards have proven that this is only the beginning. With her beauty, fashion and business sense to match, the Island girl turned international superstar will continue to rock the world for years to come. The journey continues! 
=======================================================
With the global release of her sixth Island Def Jam studio album Talk That Talk in November 2011, Rihanna took another giant step in her journey to dominate popular music and fashion worldwide. Talk That Talk’s first single, “We Found Love” (written and produced by, and featuring Scottish musician Calvin Harris) was a #1 hit in some 20 territories (including the U.S., UK, Canada, Ireland, France, Germany, Switzerland, New Zealand, and more), with too many gold, platinum, and multi-platinum certifications to count. In addition:
• “We Found Love” was by far the biggest single of Rihanna’s career to date, spending 10 weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S., besting her previous record of seven weeks apiece at #1 for “Umbrella” (featuring Jay-Z) back in 2007, and T.I.’s “Love Your Life” (featuring Rihanna) in 2008.
• “We Found Love” made history as Rihanna’s 11th #1 hit on the Hot 100, and her 20th Top 10 hit. At age 23, Rihanna became the youngest artist in Billboard chart history to earn 11 Hot 100 #1 hits.
• As reported by Billboard.com, she collected her 20 Hot 100 Top 10 singles faster than any other solo artist, six years and four months. The time span beat Madonna’s previous record (by five months), and placed Rihanna second only to the Beatles. 
• “We Found Love”’s success placed Rihanna in a very rarefied field as just the fifth woman to earn ‘20-and-over’ Top 10 hits, alongside Whitney Houston (with 23 career Top 10s), Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson (27 each), and Madonna at the top (37). 
Talk That Talk’s worldwide sales of more than 4.5 million units and counting (as of early 2012), brought Rihanna’s worldwide album sales to more than 30 million. As she enters her eighth year as a Def Jam artist, Rihanna has also logged a phenomenal 120 million digital song sales, establishing her as the top selling digital artist of all time. This was underscored as far back as the Billboard Music Awards at the end of 2009, when Rihanna was named the Top Digital Song Artist Of the Decade.
Talk That Talk was the worthy follow-up to Rihanna’s previous album, Loud (November 2010). Loud’s first two singles, “What’s My Name” (featuring Drake) and “Only Girl (In the World),” were worldwide successes, both solid #1 chart-toppers in the U.S. and UK. “What’s My Name,” “Only Girl (In the World)” and “S&M” became Rihanna’s 8th, 9th, and 10th #1 Billboard Hot 100 hits, respectively. With that:
• Rihanna was named the only female artist of the previous decade to chart ten #1’s on the Hot 100 as well as the youngest soloist to notch ten Hot 100 #1’s.
• “Only Girl (In the World)” became her 8th #1 Hot Dance Airplay chart hit, eclipsing Madonna’s long-standing record of seven #1’s on the Dance chart (launched in 2003). 
• Rihanna also broke a record at Top 40 with the most #1’s at the format (8) in the chart’s 18 year history.
From her Caribbean roots to the top of the charts, the runways of Paris and Milan and some of the biggest stages in the world, - Including London’s O2 arena where she sold out ten concerts, the first by a female solo artist - the 24-ear-old, Barbados-born beauty has already earned the coveted title of international superstar. From her breakthrough multi-platinum album A Girl Like Me to her ubiquitous global smash “Umbrella,” in just a few short years, Rihanna helped redefine the path of popular music for a new generation. 
It’s hard to imagine that just four years ago, Rihanna was a young girl living in the beautiful Barbados parish of Saint Michael. Her first connection to the music industry came when she met a vacationing music producer named Evan Rogers from New York City. After an impromptu performance for Evan, he was absolutely certain she would one day make history. Soon after, Evan and Rihanna traveled to the Big Apple in search of a record deal. It took just one meeting with Jay-Z and Antonio “L.A.” Reid for Rihanna to score her big break; Jay, who had just recently been appointed the President of Def Jam Records, was so taken by the young singer's arresting natural talent that he signed her to the legendary label on the spot.
In 2005, Def Jam released Rihanna's dynamic debut album, Music of the Sun, which garnered much attention due to the popularity of her highly addictive dancehall-flavored first single, “Pon de Replay.” A year later, she released her platinum-selling second album A Girl Like Me, featuring the #1 singles “SOS” and “Unfaithful.”
With two successful albums under her belt in just two years, Rihanna dropped her third album, the multi-platinum Good Girl Gone Bad, in 2007. The album's first single, "Umbrella," was the undisputed number one pop song of the summer and dominated the U.S. pop, urban and crossover Billboard charts for 52 weeks in a row. "Umbrella" was also the #1 single on the UK singles chart for eleven consecutive weeks and went on to win "Video of the Year" and "Monster Single of the Year" at the 2007 MTV VMAs.
The momentum established with Good Girl Gone Bad and “Umbrella” carried over to Rihanna’s next album, Rated R. Rated R was released worldwide in November 2009 and the first single, “Russian Roulette” made chart history for Rihanna – as her 12th Billboard Hot 100 career hit, placing her second (after Beyoncé) among female Hot 100 artists in the decade since 2000. The next single, “Rude Boy” (the fifth multi-platinum certified song of Rihanna’s career) hit #1 on a slew of charts – including Billboard’s Hot 100 and Hot 100 Airplay, and MediaBase’s Pop, Hot Dance Radio, Hot Dance Clubs, Rhythm, and Urban charts.
With “Rude Boy,” Rihanna became the first female artist of the past decade to chart six #1’s on the Hot 100. After “Rude Boy,” Rihanna was back on the charts as featured artist on Eminem’s “Love the Way You Lie” – which tied Rihanna for the most #1’s (six) on the Pop Songs Radio Airplay chart, with Mariah Carey, Beyoncé and Lady Gaga. The song also gave Rihanna her 7th #1 hit on the Hot 100, the prelude to “What’s My Name” and “Only Girl (In the World).”
Rihanna has won literally hundreds of music industry awards around the world – in the U.S. alone, she has earned multiple American Music Awards (5), ASCAP Pop Awards (11) and Rhythm & Soul Awards (7), BMI Urban Awards (9) and Pop Awards (10), BET (3) and BET Hip-hop Awards (2), Billboard Music Awards (18), MTV VMAs (3) and MTV Platinum Video Plays Awards (7), People’s Choice Awards (6), Soul Train Music Awards (2), Teen Choice Awards (4), and so on. 
• 2011: Best Rap Song for “All Of The Lights” by Kanye West with Rihanna, Kid Cudi & Fergie (from Kanye’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy).
• 2011: Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for “All Of The Lights” by Kanye West with Rihanna, Kid Cudi & Fergie (from Kanye’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy).
Outside the U.S., she holds multiple MOBO Awards from the UK (including Best International Act in 2007 and 2011) and multiple IFPI Awards from Europe, MTV VMAs from every region, the BRIT Award for Best International Female Artist in 2011 and 2012, Capricho Awards from Brazil, MuchMusic Video Awards from Canada, NRJ Music Awards from France, and no less than 30 Barbados Music Awards from her native country. 
As her performing career soars, Rihanna continues to push boundaries in both music and fashion. She is constantly reinventing herself and has an amazing ability to identify and help set trends, thus she has become an international style icon and cover girl. Everything from her cutting edge hairstyles to her immaculate fashion sense are heavily monitored in the glossy pages of high fashion magazines worldwide. 
Rihanna’s Influence is also proven by her social network stats and online views. She has the most viewed YouTube page of any solo artist with over 2 billion views. She is the biggest female artist on Facebook with over 54 million fans and she has over 17 million twitter followers. And she puts this influence to good use with her philanthropic efforts with DKMS (leukemia) American Cancer Society. Rihanna also maintains ongoing arrangements as spokesperson for Armani and Vita Coco products.
Recently, Rihanna wrapped up filming Universal's Battleship directed by Peter Berg. She will make her feature film debut alongside Taylor Kitsch and Alexander Skarsgard. The film is set to be released May 2012. 
Rihanna's impressive discography and a growing collection of the music industry's most cherished awards have proven that this is only the beginning. With her beauty, fashion and business sense to match, the Island girl turned international superstar will continue to rock the world for years to come. The journey continues!

=======================================================
Rihanna is the first female from Barbados to have received a Grammy Award and is currently signed to the Def Jam Recordings record label. She was presented with an area of land in Appes Hill, St. James, Barbados, in a tribute to her work.
Born in Saint Michael, Barbados, Rihanna is the daughter of Ronald Fenty (of African and Irish descent) and Monica Fenty, who has a Guyanese ancestry.
In Combermere Schoool, she formed a musical group with two of her classmates. In 2004, she was crowned Miss Combermere in a local beauty pageant, as well as performing in the 'Colours Of Combermere' school show.
She received her big break aged 15, when a friend introduced her to Evan Rogers, a music producer who was on vacation on the island. Rogers and his partner, Carl Sturken recorded Rihanna's material in the U.S. and sent it to various record companies. One of these copies reached Jay-Z, who eventually signed her to his Def Jam label.
Rihanna has named Beyonce, Brandy Norwood and her upbringing in the Caribbean as the major influences on her music.
Music Of the Sun was Rihanna's debut album, released in 2005. 'Pon de Replay' was one of the singles released from the album. The track was co-written by Rogers, Sturken and Rihanna and reached number two in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and the UK singles chart.
The album itself received platinum certification for selling over 2 million units worldwide and Rihanna promoted the album by touring as Gwen Stefani's opening act.
The second single from the album, 'If It's Lovin' That You Want', was significantly less successful, reaching 36 on the Billboard Hot 100 and 11 in the UK charts. A third single, 'Let Me', was released in Japan only.
Less than eight months after the release of her debut album, Rihanna launched a second album, A Girl Like Me, in 2006. The album went into the U.S. charts at number five. And the main single from the track, 'SOS', was used in a Nike advertising campaign. 'SOS' became the first number one Billboard single for Rihanna.
Her third top 10 U.S. hit came with 'Unfaithful', written by the R&B singer Ne-Yo, though its follow-up, 'We Ride' was less successful, which failed to chart in the Billboard Hot 100. 'Break It Off', featuring Sean Paul, was her fourth single from the album. Digital download sales helped the song jump from 52 to number 9.
Good Girl Gone Bad, her third album, was recorded with Timbaland, Ne-Yo and Stargate and released in 2007. Jay-Z and Ne-Yo also feature on the album and Justin Timberlake co-wrote 'Rehab' and sang backing vocals for the track. The album went three times platinum on the United World Albums Chart.
The first single from the album, 'Umbrella', which featured Jay-Z, was a number one hit in a number of countries. In the UK, it was the longest running number one single since Wet Wet Wet's 'Love Is All Around' (1994) and the longest running number one by a female artist since Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You' (1992). With 8,160,000 points on the United World Chart, it was the most successful song of 2007.
'Umbrella' was followed by the singles 'Shut Up And Drive', 'Don't Stop The Music' and 'Hate That I Love You'
In November 2009, Rihanna released her fourth album 'Rated R', which featured guest spots from Slash, will.i.am and Jeezy. The album debuted at number four in the US Billboard 200 albums charts, selling 181,000 copies in the United States in its first week, giving Rihanna her highest first-week sales in the US at that time.
Rihanna released her fifth album 'Loud' in 2010. 'Loud' debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 207,000 copies in its first week, making it her fastest selling album at the time. The album featured guests Drake and Nicki Minaj and had some of Rihanna's most popular singles, namely 'What's My Name?' and 'Only Girl (In The World)'. That year saw her first collaboration with Eminem in the smash hit 'Love the Way You Lie'.
In 2011, Rihanna followed up 'Loud' with her sixth album 'Talk That Talk', which debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, selling 198,000 copies in the United States. The album is platinum in the United States. Guest spots on this album included Jay-Z and Calvin Harris.
Rihanna's seventh album, 'Unapologetic' was released in November 2012. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 238,000 copies in its first week, giving Rihanna her first number one album in the United States and bestselling debut week of her career. Rihanna recruited previous producers, such as The-Dream, Chase & Status and David Guetta, to work with new producers such as Parker Ighile, Mike Will Made-It and Labrinth. The album has been certified platinum in the United States. The song 'Nobody's Business' caused controversy as it featured Rihanna's abusive ex-partner Chris Brown.  
Rihanna has received twenty-three Grammy nominations including record of the Year, Best Rap / Sung Collaboration, Best R&B performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals, Best Dance Recording. She also obtained seven Grammys including Song of the Year and Best R&B song.

In 2009 it was reported that Rihanna's partner at the time, singer Chris Brown, had violently attacked her. Brown was charged for assault and making criminal threats and later pled guilty to felony assault. He was given five years' probation and a restraining order. 
In 2013, Rihanna admitted that she was once again in a relationship with Brown, however Brown stated that the two had broken up again in May that year.
Rihanna also had a relationship with Los Angeles Dodgers baseball player Matt Kemp from late 2009 to 2010. Speculation also suggested she had dated rapper Drake.
