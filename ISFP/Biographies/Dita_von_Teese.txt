From Chapter One – “I grew up in a world of violence and unpredictability. I learned to protect myself the best I could. I learned to take care of myself because no one else would. I learned to lie, to conceal, and to cover my fear with anger and violence.
No one knew the abuse that went on in our home, as we all learned to keep it hidden. No one knew my wish to make it stop. And later, no one knew the fear that overwhelmed me and drove me to hit and hurt the ones I loved most.”
This book exposes the thinking, beliefs and actions of a child who grows up to find himself being the abuser in his family. We follow his story from before childhood to the beginning of his journey to stop his violent and abusive behaviors.
Lee Cox offers powerful insights into his journey of healing himself. When he shares his story, his courage, candor and honesty inspire his audience to help stop domestic abuse. Lee speaks to: Students, Teachers, Law Enforcement, Domestic Violence Professionals, Civic organizations, Self Help groups and Community Leaders. Contact the EVE Foundation to have Lee speak at your next event.

Dita Von Teese (born Heather Renée Sweet[1] on September 28, 1972) is an American burlesque dancer, model, costume designer, entrepreneur and occasional actress.[2] She is thought to have helped re-popularize burlesque performance[3] and was once married to Marilyn Manson.[4]
Von Teese was born in Rochester, Michigan, the middle of three daughters in a middle-class family.[5] Her father was a machinist and her mother a manicurist.[5][6] She is of English, Scottish, Armenian and German heritage.[7] Dita later clarified that one of her grandmothers was half-Armenian and adopted into an Anglo-Saxon American family.[8] Von Teese is known for her fascination with 1940s cinema and classic vintage style. This began at a young age and was fostered by her mother, who would buy clothes for her daughter to dress up in. Her mother was a fan of old, Golden Age-era Hollywood films, and it was from her that Von Teese developed a fascination with the actresses of that day, especially Betty Grable.
She was classically trained as a ballet dancer from an early age, and danced solo at age thirteen for a local ballet company. Though she originally wanted to be a ballerina, Von Teese states that "by 15, I was as good as I’d ever be."[6] She was later to incorporate this element into her burlesque shows, where she frequently goes en pointe. The family relocated from Michigan to Orange County, California, when her father's job moved.[5] Von Teese attended University High School in Irvine.[9]
As a teenager, Von Teese's mother took her to buy her first bra, made from plain white cotton, and gave her a plastic egg containing a pair of wrinkly, flesh-colored tights.[9] Von Teese says she was disappointed as she had been hoping to receive beautiful lacy garments and stockings, of the type she had glimpsed in her father's Playboy magazines. This fueled her passion for lingerie. She worked in a lingerie store as a salesgirl when she was fifteen, eventually as a buyer. Von Teese has been fond of wearing elaborate lingerie such as corsets and basques with fully fashioned stockings ever since. In college, Von Teese studied historic costuming and aspired to work as a stylist for films. She is a trained costume designer, often designing (and copyrighting) her photo shoots herself.[10]
Von Teese got her stage name by adopting the name Dita as a tribute to silent film actress Dita Parlo. For her breakthrough 2002 Playboy cover, she was required to have a surname, so she chose Von Treese from the phonebook. In the magazine, this was misspelled as Von Teese, which she decided to stick with.[11]
Von Teese achieved some level of recognition in the fetish world as a tightlacer. Through the wearing of a corset for many years, she had reduced her waistline to 22 inches (56 cm), and can be laced down as far as 16.5 inches (42 cm).[12]
Von Teese appeared on a number of fetish magazine covers, including Bizarre[13] and Marquis.[14] It was around this time when she appeared on the cover of Midori's book, The Seductive Art of Japanese Bondage.[15] Von Teese was featured in Playboy in 1999, 2001 and 2002, with a cover-featured pictorial in 2002. The German metal band Atrocity chose her as the cover model for their 2008 album, Werk 80 II.[16]
Von Teese is best known for her burlesque routines and is frequently dubbed the "Queen of Burlesque" in the press.[17][18] Von Teese began performing burlesque in 1992, and, as a proponent of New Burlesque, has helped to popularize its revival.[19] In her own words, she "puts the tease back into striptease" with long, elaborate dance shows with props and characters, often inspired by 1930s and 1940s musicals and films. Some of her more famous dances have involved a carousel horse, a giant powder compact, a filigree heart and a clawfoot bathtub with a working shower head. Her signature show features a giant martini glass. Her feather fan dance, inspired by burlesque dancer Sally Rand, featured the world's largest feather fans, now on display in Hollywood's Museum of Sex.[20]
Her burlesque career has included some memorable performances. She once appeared at a benefit for the New York Academy of Art wearing nothing but $5 million worth of diamonds.[21] Additionally, Von Teese became the first guest star at Paris's Crazy Horse cabaret club with her appearance in October 2006.[22] Also in 2006, Von Teese appeared on an episode of America's Next Top Model (cycle 7) doing a workshop to teach the contestants about sexiness by means of burlesque dancing and posing. In 2007 Von Teese performed at the adult entertainment event Erotica 07 in London alongside Italian rock noir band Belladonna.
Von Teese's first book (in collaboration with Bronwyn Garrity), which consisted of her opinions on the history of burlesque and fetish, Burlesque and the Art of the Teese / Fetish and the Art of the Teese, was published in 2006 by HarperCollins (and in New York by Regan Books). Vanity Fair called her a "Burlesque Superheroine".
Von Teese participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow, Russia, as part of the stage performance for the German entry "Miss Kiss Kiss Bang". The act placed 20th out of 25 participants in the final round of the contest.[23] Later, she said her cleavage was censored during the show because it was too voluptuous.[24]
Von Teese is also an occasional actress. In her early years she appeared in fetish-related, soft-core pornographic movies, such as Romancing Sara, Matter of Trust, in which she is billed as Heather Sweet, and also in two Andrew Blake hard-core fetish films, Pin Ups 2[25] and Decadence.
In recent years she has appeared in more mainstream features, such as the 2005 short film, The Death of Salvador Dali, written by Delaney Bishop, which won best screenplay and best cinematography at recent festivals, including SXSW, Raindance Film Festival and Mill Valley Film Festival, and won Best Actress at Beverly Hills Film Festival. She starred in the feature film Saint Francis in 2007.[26]
In addition, she has appeared in a number of music videos, including the video for the Green Day song "Redundant,"[27] the video for "Zip Gun Bop" by swing band Royal Crown Revue, Agent Provocateur's video for their cover of Joy Division's "She's Lost Control," and (performing her martini-glass burlesque routine) the video for "Mobscene" by Marilyn Manson.[28] She has been featured in a striptease/burlesque act in George Michael's live tour 2008, for the song "Feelin' Good."[29] In 2013 in the music video "Up in the Air" by Thirty Seconds to Mars.
She has expressed that acting is not at the top of her agenda and she would only take roles that she feels are right for her, stating in 2007, "I don't understand why women feel the need to go into acting as soon as they become famous ... But I suppose if the part were aesthetically correct, then maybe I could consider it."[30]
In January 2011, Von Teese guest-starred in the CBS police procedural drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, in which her friend Eric Szmanda stars, in an episode called "A Kiss Before Frying" in which she played Rita von Squeeze, a femme fatale version of herself, who seduces Szmanda's character Greg Sanders in a plot inspired by film noir.[31]
Von Teese has appeared on a number of best-dressed lists[32] and frequents the front row of fashion shows, particularly Christian Dior, Vivienne Westwood, Jean Paul Gaultier and Marc Jacobs, labels she is often seen wearing. Speaking of her love of Gaultier, Von Teese has said, "Jean Paul Gaultier, John Galliano and Vivienne Westwood were the first designers that really made an impact on me. Jean Paul has a lot of the same obsessions that I do, like corsetry, ballet-peach satin and silks, black silk velvet, bullet bras and girdles. When I was a teenager, I would look for 1930s peach satin lingerie pieces to try to get his look for less, because there was no way I could afford his things back then. It was a dream come true to meet him and become friends with him. I met him the first time when I was doing my first fashion pictorial, which was for Flaunt magazine, and it was a huge story of me wearing the most important pieces from his haute couture archives, and that was a dream!" [33]
She has also done catwalk work. During Los Angeles Fashion Week for spring 2004, she modeled for former club kid Richie Rich's fashion label, Heatherette. In 2005 she appeared in the Autumn/Winter Ready-to-Wear show for Giambattista Valli, a former designer for Ungaro, in Paris. In the 2006 Milan Fashion Week, Von Teese was on the runway, opening for the Moschino diffusion label, Moschino Cheap & Chic, autumn/winter 2006/7 show. In 2007, she appeared twice in the Jean Paul Gaultier haute couture show during the Paris Fashion Week. She has starred in several ad campaigns. She appeared in Vivienne Westwood's spring/summer 2005 collection adverts and became the face of Australian clothing range "Wheels and Dollbaby" for their 2006/7 Spring/Summer advertising campaign. She was an ambassador/spokesmodel for HIV/AIDS awareness when she was selected (along with Eve, Deborah Harry, and Lisa Marie Presley) for MAC Cosmetics' Viva Glam VI campaign (a collection of lipsticks and lipgloss where 100% of the proceeds are for worldwide AIDS charities and to raise awareness for HIV/AIDS). Von Teese has appeared in Vanity Fair, Vogue, Elle,[34] and international issues of nearly every fashion magazine. She has campaigned on behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and has appeared in their ads. She participated at the PETA's campaign "Animal Birth Control (ABC)."[35]
In spite of this, Von Teese states that she never uses a stylist. "The one time I hired a stylist, they picked up a pair of my 1940s shoes and said, 'These would look really cute with jeans.' I immediately said, 'You’re out of here.'" She does her own make-up, and dyes her naturally blonde hair black at home.[6] Von Teese's unique style is "inspired by eccentric women like Luisa Casati, Anna Piaggi, and Isabella Blow."[36]
She has designed a new lingerie range with Wonderbra.[37] In May 2012, Dita Von Teese launched her makeup collection "Classics" in partnership with the German cosmetic brand Art Deco. Compact powder, blushers, eye styler, eye shadows, mascara and lipstick were produced to recreate the burlesque performer's retro look.[36]
In 2012 Dita Von Teese launched her own clothing line[38] and underwear line called Von Follies.[39][40] In 2013 Dita was both model and muse for the 'Dita' 3D printed gown designed by Michael Schmidt and Francis Bitonti and 3D printed by Shapeways exactly to fit her body.[41] Constructed of over 3,000 interlocked 3D printed components and over 12,000 Swarovski crystals it is one of the first fully articulated 3D printed garments to take the technology from haute couture to a sensual fabric-like form.[42]
Dita frequently takes Pilates and dressage lessons. Her house is dedicated to early 20th-century decor, along with a complete pink kitchen with vintage appliances. She also has a room dedicated to hats.[5]
Von Teese currently resides in Hollywood, California.[43][44] She is a collector of vintage china, particularly eggcups and tea sets,[45] and drives a 1938 Packard One Twenty Eight, a 1946 Ford Super De Luxe,[46] a BMW Z4 and a 1965 Jaguar S-type.[47] She also owned a 1939 Chrysler New Yorker from 1997 to December 2010.[48]
Prior to her marriage to Marilyn Manson, she was romantically linked to vocalist/guitarist Mike Ness of Social Distortion[49] and to actor Peter Sarsgaard.[50] She has also spoken of several same-sex experiences, including a serious relationship with a woman when she was 20.[51] She also dated French aristocrat Louis-Marie de Castelbajac.[52]
Marilyn Manson had been a longtime fan of hers and was a member of her website. They first met when he asked her to dance in one of his music videos and though she was unable to, the two remained in contact. On Manson's 32nd birthday, in 2001,[53] she arrived with a bottle of absinthe and they became a couple. Manson proposed on March 22, 2004 and gave her a 1930s, 7-carat (1.4 g), European round-cut diamond engagement ring. On November 28, 2005, they were married in a private, non-denominational ceremony at home. A larger ceremony was held on December 3 at Gurteen Castle in Kilsheelan (County Tipperary), Ireland, the home of their friend, Gottfried Helnwein. The wedding was officiated by surrealist film director and comic book writer Alejandro Jodorowsky and appeared as a feature in the pages of Vogue.
On December 29, 2006, Von Teese filed for divorce from Manson citing "irreconcilable differences."[54] Von Teese left their house empty-handed on Christmas Eve, and was not able to get in touch with Manson to inform him of her intention to divorce him. In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, Von Teese says "I wasn't supportive of his partying or his relationship with another girl. As much as I loved him I wasn't going to be part of that." Von Teese also stated that she gave Manson an ultimatum, and said that "it didn't work. Instead it made me the enemy."[43] Von Teese did not seek spousal support and seemed to have no interest in his assets.[54] The news broke for the public and for Manson on his birthday on January 5, 2007, when he was served the divorce papers.
Von Teese was a featured guest on the sixth episode (original air date: October 25, 2006) of cycle 7 of America's Next Top Model[55] and as a coach in the burlesque special Faking It.[56] She appeared as a guest judge on RuPaul's Drag Race. Dita Von Teese also appeared on stage at the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest during the German entry.

      Posed nude for the December 2002 issue of Playboy magazine. She was photographed by her then-future husband, Marilyn Manson.

      I'm really a small town girl from Michigan who has a good laugh that being a fancy-pants stripper got me here!
      Some people say what I do isn't very liberating. I say it's pretty liberating to get $20,000 for 10 minutes work.
      Neither of us is ready. I don't feel that we need to have children to validate our marriage and I don't need children to claim I'm a fulfilled woman.
      I've lost my luggage before and not had my makeup, and he's lost his luggage and not had his makeup - so it's great that we're always covered.

Heather Renée Sweet (born September 28, 1972), better known by her pseudonym Dita Von Teese, is a professional pin-up model and burlesque dancer. Often heralded as "the Queen of Burlesque", she has become a key figure in the burlesque revival. She was the girlfriend of Marilyn Manson from February, 2001 until December 3, 2005 when they married, up to their divorce on January 5, 2007. She is now allegedly dating French aristocrat Count Louis-Marie de Castelbajac.[1]
Dita Von Teese was born in Rochester, Michigan. Her mother was a manicurist and her father was a machinist. Von Teese is well known for her fascination with 1940s cinema and classic retro style, and this began at a young age and was fostered by her mother, who would buy clothes for Dita to dress up in. Her mother was a fan of old, Golden-era Hollywood films, and it was from her that Dita developed a fascination with the actresses of that day, especially Betty Grable, an actress that she frequently cites as her favorite.
She was classically trained as a ballet dancer from an early age, and danced solo at age thirteen for a local ballet company. Though she originally wanted to be a ballerina, Von Teese states that "By 15 I was as good as I'd ever be". She was later to incorporate this element into her burlesque shows, where she frequently goes en pointe.
At age twelve she moved from Michigan to Orange County, California with her parents and her two sisters. Von Teese attended University High School in Irvine.
As a teenager, Von Teese's mother took her to buy her first bra, made from plain white cotton, and gave her a plastic egg containing a pair of wrinkly, flesh-coloured tights. Von Teese says she was  disappointed as she had been hoping to receive beautiful lacy garments and stockings, of the type she had glimpsed in her father's Playboy magazines. This fueled her passion for lingerie. She worked in a lingerie store as a salesgirl when she was fifteen, and eventually as a buyer. This was where she got her first corset. Von Teese has been fond of wearing elaborate lingerie such as corsets and stockings since.
In college Von Teese studied historic costuming and aspired to work as a stylist for period films. She is a trained costume designer.
Von Teese began her career in a local strip club when she was nineteen. Disappointed with the lack of originality in all the other strippers' acts, Von Teese created a vintage-inspired look, with bee-hive hairstyle and elbow-length gloves, confusing and fascinating the clientèle. 
It was during this time at the strip club that she began some glamour modelling, before she eventually became a fetish model. Her retro pin-up look, frequently emulating Bettie Page in photo shoots, set her apart from most other fetish models. 
Her official website, often referred to as one of the first model sites on the internet, was created in 1992. Since, Von Teese has maintained meticulous care to own the copyright to the majority of her images, very aware of what became of models, such as Bettie Page, who did not.
Von Teese achieved some level of recognition in the fetish world as a tightlacer. Through the wearing of a corset for many years, she had reduced her natural waistline to 22 inches, and can be laced down as far as 16 and a half inches.
Von Teese appeared on a number of fetish magazine covers, including Bizarre and Marquis. It was around this time when she appeared, bound and gagged, on the cover of Midori's book: The Seductive Art of Japanese Bondage.
Von Teese was featured in Playboy magazine in 1999, 2001 and 2002. It was her Playboy cover in December of 2002 that gave her her last name. Originally known simply as "Dita", a tribute to silent film actress Dita Parlo, Playboy insisted she use a last name. She picked "Von Treese" out of the phonebook, but it was misspelled "Von Teese". Dita, preferring the typo, adopted it as her name. Dita says that it is her appearances in Playboy that finally won her father's respect for her profession.
It is Von Teese's burlesque routines that she is best known for. Von Teese began performing burlesque in 1993 and, as a proponent of New Burlesque, has helped to popularize its revival. In her own words, she "puts the tease back into striptease" with long, elaborate dance shows with props and characters, often inspired by 1930s and 1940s musicals and films. Some of her more famous dances include numbers involving a carousel horse, a giant powder compact, a filigree heart and a claw-toe bathtub with a working shower head. Her feather fan dance, inspired by burlesque dancer Sally Rand, features feather fans that are largest in the world and are now on display in Hollywood's Museum of Sex. Her signature show features a giant martini glass.
Her burlesque career has included some memorable performances, including once performing at a benefit for the New York Academy of Art wearing nothing but $5 million worth of diamonds. Additionally, Von Teese became the first ever guest star to perform at the Crazy Horse cabaret club in the show's history when she appeared there in October 2006.
Cameron Diaz performed a tribute to Von Teese's martini glass routine in the film Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. Von Teese's name appears in the credits, listed under "Special Thanks".
Von Teese's first book, which consisted of her opinions on the history of burlesque and fetish, Burlesque and the Art of the Teese/Fetish and the Art of the Teese, was published in 2006 by HarperCollins. Vanity Fair called her "a Burlesque Superheroine."
Von Teese is also an occasional actress. In her early years she appeared in fetish-related movies, such as Romancing Sara, Matter of Trust, in which she is billed as Heather Sweet, and also in two films by Andrew Blake: Pin Ups 2 and Decadence.

She is due to appear in the upcoming feature films Saint Francis and The Boom Boom Room, both expected in 2007.
In addition to this, she has appeared in a number of music videos, including the video for the Green Day song "Redundant", the video for "Zip Gun Bop" by swing band Royal Crown Revue, Agent Provocateur's video for their cover of "She's Lost Control", and performed her Martini Glass burlesque routine in the video for "mOBSCENE" by Marilyn Manson.
However, Dita has said that acting is not at the top of her agenda and she would only take roles that she feels are right for her, stating, "I don't understand why women feel the need to go into acting as soon as they become famous... But I suppose if the part were aesthetically correct, then maybe I could consider it."
In recent years the fashion world has come to accept Von Teese and her retro look, and she has appeared on a number of best-dressed lists. Von Teese frequents the front row of fashion shows, particularly Moschino and Marc Jacobs, labels she is often seen wearing. 
She has also done various catwalk work. During Los Angeles Fashion Week, Spring 2004, she modeled for former-club kid Richie Rich's fashion label, Heatherette. In 2005 she appeared in the Autumn/Winter Ready-to-Wear show for Giambattista Valli, a former designer for Ungaro, in Paris. In the 2006 Mila Fashion Week, Von Teese was on the runway, opening for the Moschino diffusion label, Moschino Cheap & Chic, Autumn/Winter 2006/2007 show. In 2007, she appeared twice in the Jean Paul Gaultier Haute Couture show during the Paris Fashion Week. Additionally, she has starred in several ad campaigns. She appeared in Vivienne Westwood's Spring/Summer 2005 collection adverts and became the face of Australian clothing range Wheels and Dollbaby for their 2006/2007 Spring/Summer advertising campaign. Currently, she is a spokesmodel for MAC Cosmetics. Von Teese has appeared in 'Vanity Fair, Vogue, Elle, and international issues of nearly every fashion magazine. 
In spite of this, Von Teese states that she never uses a stylist. "The one time I hired a stylist, they picked up a pair of my 1940s shoes and said, "These would look really cute with jeans." I immediately said, 'You're out of here.'" She does her own make-up, and dyes her naturally blonde hair black at home.
Von Teese currently resides in Hollywood, California. She is a collector of vintage china, particularly eggcups and tea sets, and she drives a 1939 Chrysler New Yorker and a 1965 Jaguar S-type.
Prior to her marriage, Von Teese had been romantically linked to guitarist Mike Ness of Social Distortion and to actor Peter Sarsgaard. She has also admitted to having several lesbian experiences including a long-term relationship with a woman when she was 20.
Dita attended Jessicka's first solo show titled, Smile Even if it Hurts with fellow artist/musician Lindsey Way which took place on November 13, 2010 in Los Angeles at the Dark Dark Science Gallery. The show featured a collaboration between Jessicka and Dita's boyfriend artist Count Louis-Marie de Castelbajac. 
Marilyn Manson had been a long time fan, and was a member of her website. They first met when he asked her to dance in one of his music videos. Though she was unable to, the two kept in contact. On Manson's 32nd birthday, in 2001, she arrived with a bottle of absinthe, and they became a couple.
Manson proposed on March 22, 2004 and gave her a 1930s, 7-carat, European round-cut diamond engagement ring.
On December 3, 2005, they were married, in a non-denominational ceremony at Gurteen Castle in Kilsheelan (County Tipperary), Ireland, the home of their friend, Gottfried Helnwein. The wedding was officiated by surrealist film director and comic book writer Alejandro Jodorowsky. They reportedly exchanged vows in front of approximately 60 guests, including burlesque sensation Catherine D'lish, Lisa Marie Presley, Eric Szmanda, Jessicka of Jack Off Jill and Christian Hejnal of Scarling.. She wore a royal purple silk taffeta gown, made by Vivienne Westwood plus a tri-corned hat designed by Stephen Jones and matching Mr. Pearl corset. Moschino designed an additional wardrobe for the rest of the weekend, exclusively for Von Teese. The reception music was provided by the retro German band Palast Orchester mit Max Raabe. Guests were invited to participate in skeet shooting, archery and falconry in the days following the wedding. The wedding pictures appeared in the May 2006 edition of Vogue under the heading "The Bride Wore Purple".
The couple lived in Laurel Canyon with their four Devon Rex cats, Lily, Aliester, Edgar and Hermann, and two dachshunds, Greta and Eva.
On December 29, 2006 Von Teese filed for divorce from Manson citing "irreconcilable differences." Von Teese left their house empty-handed on Christmas Eve, and was not able to get in touch with Manson to inform him of her intentions of divorce.  In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, Von Teese says "I wasn't supportive of his partying or his relationship with another girl. As much as I loved him I wasn't going to be part of that". The 'other girl' is believed to be 19-year-old actress Evan Rachel Wood, with whom Manson has continued his relationship after his divorce from Von Teese, despite scathing comments from critics. Von Teese also stated that she gave Manson an ultimatum, but says "it didn't work. Instead, it made me the enemy."
Von Teese is not seeking spousal support and seems to have no interest in his assets. The news broke for the public and for Manson on his birthday on January 5, 2007, when he was served the divorce papers. In return he wrote the song Putting Holes in Happiness to cope with it.
Additionally, Von Teese was a featured guest on the sixth episode of Cycle 7 of America's Next Top Model on October 25, 2006.

A spectacular salute to our D-Day heroes: Stunning fireworks display lights up the Normandy beaches as Kate and William join royals and world leaders to honour those who won our freedom
Samantha Cameron walks hand-in-hand with veteran's family member as they attend commemorative service to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings
A royal salute for the fallen heroes of D-Day: Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall join the Queen and President Obama as they pay their respects at Sword Beach
        The Royal couple sat down with former British soldiers who fought alongside 150,000 Allied troops on the 'Longest Day' 70 years ago. Earlier in the day Her Majesty bowed as she laid a wreath during a poignant service of remembrance in Bayeux, the first town in Normandy to be freed from Hitler's grip after the invasion on June 6 1944. Ten miles away U.S. President Barack Obama spoke at the American War Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer where almost 10,000 U.S troops who died in the Second World War are buried. Flanked by veterans, President Obama said they and their comrades 'turned the tide in that common struggle for freedom' on D-Day. At dawn those who stormed the beaches of Normandy exactly 70 years ago saluted the English Channel to mark the moment the D-Day assault started.
Still sulking, Mr Putin? Just weeks after Charles accused him of acting like Hitler, the Russian president stands by as Obama charms the royals
       World leaders gathered in Normandy to mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day amid growing tensions over Russian aggression towards Ukraine. Mr Putin is due to come face-to-face with the Prince of Wales later. As heads of state gathered for a group photo to mark  D-Day at Benouville Castle, Mr Putin cut a solitary figure while Barack Obama and New Zealand's Governor-General Jerry Mateparae fussed around the Queen.
      Former soldiers from Britain and the US stood alongside other heroes as they recalled the harrowing day in 1944. Many were seen saluting at the gravestones of their friends while others wiped tears from their eyes.
