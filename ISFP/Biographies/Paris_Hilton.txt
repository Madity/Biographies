This article is about the American socialite.  For her self-titled fragrance, see Paris Hilton (fragrance).  For the hotel chain, which has a hotel in Paris, France, see Hilton Hotels.  For the gossip blogger, see Perez Hilton.
Paris Whitney Hilton (born February 17, 1981)[1] is an American socialite, actress and entertainer. She is the great-granddaughter of Conrad Hilton, the founder of Hilton Hotels. Born in New York City and raised in both Beverly Hills, California and New York, Hilton began a modeling career as a teenager when she signed with Donald Trump's modeling agency, T Management. Her hard-partying lifestyle and rumored short-lived relationships with Leonardo DiCaprio and Oscar De La Hoya led her to earn a position as a fixture in entertainment news. For her notoriety as a socialite, Hilton was hailed by the media as "New York's leading It Girl" in 2001.[2]
In 2003, Hilton came to prominence after a sex tape with her then-boyfriend Rick Salomon was leaked. Later that year, she starred in the reality television series The Simple Life alongside Nicole Richie, which provided both women with international recognition. In the following years, she released her autobiography Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose (2004), landed a supporting role in the horror film House of Wax (2005), and released her debut studio album Paris (2006). Hilton returned to reality television with Paris Hilton's My New BFF (2008) and its two spin-offs Paris Hilton's British Best Friend (2009) and Paris Hilton's Dubai BFF (2009). She served as a voice actress in the TV movie The Dog Who Saved Christmas Vacation (2010) and appeared in the reality show The World According to Paris (2011). She had a part in Sofia Coppola's independent film The Bling Ring (2013).
Critics and admirers alike have stated that Hilton epitomizes the title of famous for being famous;[3] she is an example of the modern phenomenon of the "celebutante", the celebrity who rises to fame not because of their talent or work but because of their inherited wealth and controversial lifestyle. In recent years, she has parlayed her media fame into a fashion line and various perfumes with her celebrity endorsement—her fragrances have reportedly earned $1.5 billion. Currently, there are 44 Paris Hilton Stores worldwide and her brand includes perfumes, handbags, watches, footwear, among other products. Hilton earns over $10 million a year from her products sales[4][5] and as of 2005, she was paid around $300,000 for appearances in clubs and events.[6]
Hilton was born in New York City, New York. Her mother, Kathy Hilton (née Kathleen Elizabeth Avanzino),[7][8] is a socialite and former actress, and her father, Richard Howard "Rick" Hilton, is a businessman. She is the oldest of four children: she has one sister, Nicholai Olivia "Nicky" Hilton (born 1983), and two brothers, Barron Nicholas Hilton II (born 1989) and Conrad Hughes Hilton III (born 1994). Her paternal great grandfather was Conrad Hilton, who founded the Hilton Hotels. She is of Norwegian, German, Italian (from a maternal great grandfather), English, and Irish ancestry.[9][10][11][12] She is a half-niece of two child stars of the 1970s, Kim and Kyle Richards.
She was raised Roman Catholic and still attends Mass.[13][14] Hilton moved between numerous homes in her youth, including a suite in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, Beverly Hills, and the Hamptons. As a child she was good friends with other socialites, including Nicole Richie and Kim Kardashian.[15]
Growing up in Los Angeles, Hilton attended the Buckley School and the St. Paul the Apostle Church and School, where she graduated in 1995.[16] She then attended her freshman year of high school at the Marywood-Palm Valley School in Rancho Mirage, California from 1995–1996. In 1996, when Hilton was 14 years old, her family moved to the East Coast.[17] In New York, she briefly attended Convent of the Sacred Heart (while Lady Gaga was a student there) in 1996 before transferring again to the Dwight School.[18][19] At 16, Hilton spent one year at the Provo Canyon School, a school for emotionally troubled teens.[20][21] She then attended the Canterbury Boarding School, in New Milford, Connecticut from the fall of 1998 to February 1999 for her junior year, where she was a member of the ice hockey team.[22] In February 1999, the month she turned 18, she was expelled from Canterbury for violating school rules.[19] After being expelled from Canterbury, she returned to the Dwight School before dropping out a few months later as a high school junior.[15] She later earned her GED.[15][23][24]
Hilton began modeling as a child, initially at charity events.[25] When she was 19, she signed with Donald Trump's modeling agency, T Management.[25] Hilton stated that while she "wanted to model," Trump was wishing to have her at his agency, and after she signed she was "loving" the work.[25] While working as a model, she was becoming a daily fixture in entertainment news for her heavy partying; according to Vanity Fair, Cisco Adler, producer of Sweetie Pie (where Hilton acted in) stated that she was "a young party girl who gets sucked into the L.A. party scene and grew up a little too fast".[26] In 2001, Hilton developed a reputation as a socialite, being identified as "New York's leading It Girl" whose fame was beginning to "extend beyond the New York tabloids".[25] Around that time, she made a cameo appearance in Zoolander and was on several magazine covers such as UK's Tatler, Italy's Giola and USA's Vanity Fair and FHM.[27] She also appeared in Vincent Gallo's Honey Bunny video.[28][29] In 2002, she was one of the leads in the straight-to-video horror movie Nine Lives. Beyondhollywood.com felt that "Hilton's presence in the cast is the film's main marketing point, which is plainly obvious by the fact that she's front and center on the box art and is the only recognizable name in the cast" and also noted that her character was basically herself: "Hilton plays—what else?—a spoiled American socialite who shops on three continents in one day. The script is even clever enough to take a few jabs at Hilton's real-life social standing, even mentioning that she's been on the cover of a few sleaze rags in her day".[30] In that year, she became engaged to fashion model Jason Shaw but they broke up in early 2003.[31]
Hilton's breakout role came in 2003, when she co-starred with socialite counterpart Nicole Richie in the Fox reality series The Simple Life, which premiered on December 2, 2003, shortly after Hilton's sex tape was released.[32] The show started airing to well received ratings; the premiere episode drew 13,000,000 viewers, increasing Fox's Adults 18–49 rating by 79%.[33] At that time, she started to be recognizable for her onscreen dumb blonde persona in reality television and after the end of The Simple Life she has remarked several times that she played a character within the series and it is not who she is in real life, despite people's perception of her.[34][35] The year the show premiered, she started a relationship with singer Nick Carter, which lasted until 2004.[36]
Hilton launched a lifestyle brand in 2004. She helped design a collection of purses for Japanese label Samantha Thavasa. The 10-piece collection, a jewelry line designed by Hilton, was sold on Amazon.com.[37] She stated that she wanted to "create a line that was beautiful and very high quality, yet affordable and available to everyone".[38] The line was described as "inspired by Hilton's personal style – feminine, flirtatious and glamorous – with heart, star and cross motifs."[38] In the fall of 2004, Hilton released an autobiographical book, Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose,[39] co-written by Merle Ginsberg, which includes full color photographs of her and her advice on life as an heiress.[40] The book was in the New York Times bestseller list, ranking at seven.[41] The quote "Dress cute wherever you go; life is too short to blend in" was added to The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations in September 2009.[42] She was involved in the creation of a perfume line by Parlux Fragrances. Originally set to be a small release, high demand led to a wider release before December 2004. The launch was followed by a 47% increase in sales of Parlux products, predominantly due to sales of the Hilton-branded perfume.[43] After the success of Hilton's perfume, Parlux Fragrances released several more perfumes with her name, including fragrances for men.[44] Hilton released her second book called Your Heiress Diary: Confess It All to Me in 2005[45] and also in that year, she launched her second fragrance Just Me.
After Hilton hosted NBC's Saturday Night Live, with band Keane as the musical guest, in February 2005,[46] she got her first major role in the horror thriller film House of Wax, in which Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray also starred.[47] The movie, after being first screened at the Tribeca Film Festival,[48] opened in May 2005,[49] receiving mixed reviews.[50] Giving a positive review for her performance, Matthew Turner for the View London said that Hilton "does better than you might expect".[51] But while MTV felt that she was "actually pretty good",[52] TV Guide called Hilton "talentless".[53] Her role as Paige Edwards won the Teen Choice Award for "Best Scream" and earned her a nomination for "Choice Breakout Performance – Female".[54] (It also won her the 2005 Razzie for "Worst Supporting Actress" at the 2005 Golden Raspberry Awards.)[55] She also earned a nomination for "Best Frightened Performance" at the 2006 MTV Movie Awards. House of Wax grossed over $70,000,000.[56] From May to October of that year, she was engaged to Greek shipping heir Paris Latsis.[57]
The Simple Life, which ran for three seasons on FOX, was cancelled after a dispute between Hilton and Richie in 2005. Hilton commented: "It's no big secret that Nicole and I are no longer friends. Nicole knows what she did, and that's all I'm ever going to say about it."[58] Neither Richie nor Hilton spoke publicly about the cause of the split, though it was speculated that the pair fell out due to Richie showing one of Hilton's homemade sex tapes to a group of their friends.[59] They renewed their friendship in October 2006.[60]
After The Simple Life was cancelled by FOX in 2005, other networks, such as NBC, The WB, VH1 and MTV were all reported to be interested in obtaining the rights to air new seasons of the show.[61] On November 28, 2005, E! announced that they had picked up The Simple Life and had ordered production go ahead on the fourth season, along with the rights to re-air the first three seasons. Shooting for the new season began February 27, 2006.[62] The premiere of the fourth season brought high ratings for the network with 1.3 million viewers.[63] She released her self-titled debut album, Paris, under the label on August 22, 2006. The album reached number six on the Billboard 200 for a week and sold over 600,000 copies worldwide[64] The first single "Stars Are Blind" was a massive success in the United States as it was played at more than 125 pop stations across the country.[65] The song also was a hit worldwide;[66] it was a top ten in 17 countries.[67] Although The Guardian felt that Hilton sounded "both distracted and bored stiff",[68] AllMusic commented that the album was "more fun than anything released by Britney Spears or Jessica Simpson".[69] As a whole, critical reception was mixed.[70]
In September 2006, Hilton was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol with a blood alcohol content of 0.08%. The arrest complicated the shooting of the fifth season of series. Hilton's driving license was subsequently suspended in November 2006,[71] and in January 2007 she pleaded no contest to a reckless driving charge.[72] Her punishment was 36 months' probation and fines of about $1,500.[73] The straight-to-DVD motion picture Bottoms Up was released in late 2006. The film came out with negative reviews; Australia's Urban Cinefile remarked that Hilton, as the lead role, "spends most of her screen time flicking her hair as she delivers lines like 'books are those things you read'".[74] In December 2006, National Lampoon's Pledge This!, film in which Hilton appeared and produced, premiered in a limited release before going directly to video. She missed the premiere of the movie at the Cannes Film Festival in protest to the addition of some nude scenes that were going to be included in the film. Hilton said, "I was so angry I snubbed my own premiere."[75] In August 2008, Worldwide Entertainment Group Inc. sued Hilton in the Miami District Court, alleging she did not honor her contractual agreement to provide "reasonable promotion and publicity" for the film.[76] It was reported she was paid $1,000,000 for her work.
On January 10, 2007, Hilton released the DreamCatchers line of hair extensions in partnership with Hair Tech International.[77] On January 22, 2007, Hilton's private life was thrust into the media spotlight with the launch of ParisExposed.com, a website that features images of personal documents, video, and other material allegedly obtained when the contents of a storage locker rented by Hilton was auctioned off due to lack of a $208 payment.[78] The website began charging online access to this material and received 1.2 million visitors in just over 40 hours.[79] Among the contents were medications, diaries, photographs, contracts and love letters, as well as a video of her shot by Joe Francis of Girls Gone Wild.[80] Hilton later obtained a temporary injunction against ParisExposed.com, closing down the website.[81] Also in that month, Hilton was pulled over for driving with a suspended license and signed a document acknowledging that she was not permitted to drive.[82] The following month, Hilton was caught driving 70 mph in a 35 mph zone, again with a suspended license. She also did not have her headlights on even though it was after dark. Prosecutors in the office of the Los Angeles City Attorney charged that those actions, along with the failure to enroll in a court-ordered alcohol education program, constituted a violation of the terms of her probation.[71] On May 4, Hilton was sentenced by Judge Michael T. Sauer to 45 days in jail for violating her probation. Initially, Hilton planned to appeal the sentence, and supported an online petition asking California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger for a pardon.[83] The petition was created and organized on May 5, 2007, by Joshua Morales.[84] In response, various opponents started a counter-petition to maintain the sentence.[85] Both petitions attracted tens of thousands of signatures. Hilton later switched lawyers and dropped her plans to appeal.[86]
Hilton was required to begin her jail term on June 5,[87] and checked herself into the Century Regional Detention Facility, an all-female jail in Lynwood, California after attending the 2007 MTV Movie Awards on June 3. However Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca signed orders on June 7, reassigning Hilton to 40 days of home confinement with an electronic monitoring device due to an unspecified medical condition.[88] Baca commented on the release saying, "My message to those who don't like celebrities is that punishing celebrities more than the average American is not justice,"[89] contesting that under normal circumstances, Hilton would not have served any time in jail, and he added that "The special treatment, in a sense, appears to be because of her celebrity status ... She got more time in jail".[90] On the same day that Hilton was released from jail, Judge Michael Sauer summoned her to reappear in court the following morning (June 8) as the sentencing statement had explicitly said she would serve time in jail with "No work furlough. No work release. No electronic monitoring."[91] At the hearing he declined to be briefed by Hilton's attorney in private chambers on the nature of her condition and sent her back to jail to serve out her original 45-day sentence. Upon hearing the sentence, Hilton shouted, "It's not right!" and started screaming, requesting to hug her mother who was present in the courtroom.[92][93] Concern about Hilton's condition led to her being moved to the medical wing of the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in Los Angeles, and she was moved back to the Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood on June 13.[94]
While in jail, Hilton was influenced by the clergyman minister Marty Angelo: Hilton referred to starting a "new beginning" during her interview with talk show host Larry King on June 28, 2007, two days after being released from jail,[95] and quoted from Angelo's autobiography, titled Once Life Matters: A New Beginning. On June 9, 2007, Marty Angelo petitioned Sauer,[96] asking to serve out the remainder of Hilton's jail sentence if the judge would release her to an alternative treatment program,[97] but the petition was turned down. On the same show, she revealed taking Adderall for ADHD since childhood.[98] After Hilton faced time in jail, The Simple Life finished its run at the end of the fifth season in July 2007.[99] In early August 2007, Hilton signed a licensing agreement with Antebi for a signature footwear line, "Paris Hilton Footwear", featuring stilettos, platforms, flats, wedges, and a sports collection, expected to reach stores in 2008.[100] In mid August 2007, Hilton launched a line of tops, dresses, coats, and jeans at the Kitson Boutique in Los Angeles.[101] She felt the event was "a dream come true" and described the clothing line as " fun, bright and flashy".[102] In December 2007, Hilton posed nude, covered in gold paint, to promote "Rich Prosecco", a canned version of an Italian sparkling wine.[103][104] She also traveled to Germany to promote the drink, appearing in various print ads for the product.[105]
Around that time, Hilton's grandfather, Barron Hilton, pledged 97% of his estate (the Hilton family fortune) to a charitable organization founded by their great-grandfather, Conrad N. Hilton, the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation.[106] As a result, the inheritance of his grandchildren is sharply diminished.[107][108] An immediate pledge of $1.2 billion was made (the proceeds of the sale of Hilton Hotels Corporation), with a further $1.1 billion due after his death.[106] He cited the actions of his father, Conrad N. Hilton, as the motivation for his pledge.[106] Conrad, Barron's father, had left 97% of his estate to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation and Barron subsequently contested his father's will to win back a sizeable amount of the Hilton family fortune in a settlement.[109] By leaving his estate to the Foundation, Barron is donating not only the fortune he has amassed on his own, but he is also returning the Hilton family fortune amassed by his father, Conrad, to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, where it would have gone over 30 years ago had Barron not contested his father's will. Barron stated he is proud to follow his father's example.[110] Also in 2007, Hilton modeled for 2 be free[111] and her fourth perfume came out, called Can Can.[112]
Hilton's love for dogs led her to create an apparel line for dogs called Little Lily by Paris Hilton, with some of the proceeds going to benefit animal rescue. "I have 17 dogs and I like to dress them, so I started designing this clothing line and it's really cute, like dresses and jeans – everything you can imagine for humans, but for dogs," she said in an interview during Super Bowl XLII festivities.[113] In April 2008, she guest starred on the My Name Is Earl episode "I Won't Die with a Little Help from My Friends".[114] On August 6, 2008, Hilton appeared in a video online, Paris Hilton Responds to McCain Ad, directed by Adam McKay and posted on the Funny or Die website.[115] The video featured Hilton in a parody advertisement, and was made in response to a television campaign advert Celeb, by the 2008 John McCain presidential campaign.[116][117] In Celeb, McCain briefly compared his rival Barack Obama to that of celebrities such as Hilton and Britney Spears, going on to question his readiness to lead and criticize his energy policy.[116][118][119] In what The Washington Post opined "might just be her best acting role yet,"[120] Hilton appears in the video wearing a leopard print swimsuit.[121] The video received seven million views in two days garnering worldwide press coverage, and drew both written and verbal media response from both campaigns.[122] In October Hilton featured in a second parody video posted on Funny or Die, Paris Hilton Gets Presidential with Martin Sheen, alongside Hollywood actor Martin Sheen, with his son, actor Charlie Sheen, appearing in a cameo role.[123] Hilton, heavily made up and in a green evening dress, interviews Martin Sheen in a kitchen, discussing various political issues, seeking his advice from his days playing a fictional President on The West Wing.[124]
Hilton at the premiere of documentary Paris, Not France at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival.
At the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival, a documentary about Hilton called Paris, Not France was screened.[125] She comments in the movie about how the media had portrayed her: "I'm basically being judged, and they're creating this false person, and I can't do anything about it".[126] Petty, during the premiere at the festival remarked that Hilton has "created a mystery about herself that a film like this maybe wouldn't have been a great thing for her in the past. But now, she's been so saturated in the media. We're so used to her. To see a new side of her is so exciting".[126] Later, in 2009, the film was aired in July for MTV.[127][128]
Hilton starred in an MTV reality series titled Paris Hilton's My New BFF, about her search for a new best friend.[129] The series premiered on September 30, 2008.[130] That day, Hilton released her song "My BFF" on KIIS-FM with host Ryan Seacrest.[131][132] It was the theme song for the BFF show .[132] The series proved to be a hit; 1,200,000 viewers watched the premiere episode, and it averaged a 1.6 rating among viewers 12–34 in its Tuesday 10 p.m slot, topping all other cable shows in the hour.[133] Hilton's next project was the goth/rock musical with a cult film following, Repo! The Genetic Opera,[134] where she played the character of Amber Sweet, the surgery- and painkiller-addicted daughter of a biotech magnate. Horror.com said: " Not only is this by far Hilton's best role, she's actually got a grain of gravitas in the end".[135] However, Jam! Movies called her a "hopeless twit as an actress".[136] She remarked that "Just getting a role like this offered to me was new to me because I always get offered a certain role just basically playing myself".[137] She was nominated for the Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress in 2009 for her role.[138] The film, first screened at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con International, received a limited release in the United States and Canada on November 7, 2008.[139] Repo! made "solid numbers" for its opening weekend, with a $51,600 gross in eight theaters.[140][141] Around that time, Hilton released her fifth fragrance for women called, Fairy Dust[142] and broke up with Good Charlotte guitarist Benji Madden, who she was in a relationship with since early that year.[143][144][145][146]
As a result of the American version success, on January 29, 2009, Paris Hilton's British Best Friend, a spin-off, began airing on ITV2 in England.[147] She began to film the show in October 2008.[148][149] The series did quite well; it was watched by 428,000 viewers in its first episode[150] and brought 605,000 viewers for its finale.[151] The second season of Paris Hilton's My New BFF premiered on June 2, 2009. In that same month, Hilton shot Paris Hilton's Dubai BFF[152] (which, after some complication, it was aired in 2011). Runner-up of the British series Kat McKenzie died on July 3, 2009, of a suspected overdose.[153] Hilton guest-starred in the fifth episode of Supernatural's fifth season.[154][155] In July 2009, her sixth fragrance for women Siren was launched.[156] She won the Female Celebrity Fragrance of the Year Award at the 2009 Fifi Awards.[157][158] She got involved in the creation of a sunglasses line by Gripping Eyewear. She first launched the line on October 7, 2009 and the collection became available in stores in March 2010.[159] The next month, she launched a Hair and Beauty Products line, which includes a range of shampoos, conditioners, and hair vitamins.[160] Also in 2009, she began dating The Hills star Doug Reinhardt,[161] who she broke up with in April 2010, because she was worried he was just using her to further his career.[162]
In February 2010, Hilton participated in an advertising campaign for the launch of the Brazilian beer Devassa Bem Loura, whose slogan in English roughly translates to "very blonde bitch".[163] As part of the campaign, Hilton joined the brewery's float in the carnival of Rio de Janeiro.[164] On July 2, Hilton was accused of smoking marijuana at the 2010 FIFA World Cup game between Brazil and the Netherlands. She was escorted from the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium by local police, however the case was later dismissed for unknown reasons. Hilton's publicist, Dawn Miller, stated "I can confirm that the incident was a complete misunderstanding and it was actually another person in the group who did it".[165][166] Two weeks later, Hilton was detained and released after being caught in possession of cannabis at Figari airport, Corsica.[167]
On August 10, Hilton released her 10th fragrance, Tease inspired by Marilyn Monroe.[168] On August 19, she launched a footwear line in Las Vegas. The collection costs between $60 and $160 and Hilton, during an interview, said that she "chose the styling, design, materials and colours for the line and also wanted to make sure it was super comfortable".[169] That same month, she was arrested on suspicion of cocaine possession in Las Vegas while her boyfriend, Cy Waits, was booked on charges of driving under the influence.[170][171] Initially her defence claimed that the handbag containing 0.8g of cocaine was not hers as "This purse in question was a high street brand – and by no means up to her high fashion standards."[172] Later she claimed some of the personal items (like cash and credit cards) from the bag acknowledging it was hers. In order to avoid being convicted of a felony, Hilton pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors on September 17, 2010. Under the terms of the plea bargain, she was sentenced to one year of probation, 200 hours of community service, a $2,000 fine and ordered to complete a drug-abuse treatment program.[173][174] Clark County District Attorney David Roger said that: "If she is arrested for anything besides a minor traffic violation she will spend a year in jail. There will be no discussion. The court will have no discretion."[173] On September 21, 2010, while travelling to a press conference in Tokyo to promote fashion and fragrance lines, Hilton and her sister Nicky were stopped by immigration officers at Narita Airport, Japan because of Hilton's conviction for drug possession a day earlier. Under Japan's strict anti-drug laws, people convicted of any drug crime are in general denied entry to the country.[175][176] Narita officials questioned Hilton "for hours" and Hilton and her sister were forced to stay at the airport hotel overnight.[175] On September 22, Japanese authorities decided not to grant Hilton entry into the country, and she was put on a plane back to the United States the same day. Other stops on their Asian promotion tour were cancelled, as countries like Indonesia and Malaysia have even tougher anti-drug laws.[176] The documentary Teenage Paparazzo, in which Hilton appeared, aired on HBO on September 27. The motion picture was met with critical acclaim.[177]
Hilton provided her voice for the character of Bella in the ABC made-for-television film The Dog Who Saved Christmas Vacation (it is her first voice over role).[178] She said of the film: "I just think it's a really cute film" and that "I love animal movies, I love Christmas movies, and also, my grandmother, who passed away a couple of years ago from breast cancer, actually had a standard poodle and her name was Paris. So when I'm watching this, it's kind of like watching grandma's dog. It's kind of like a sign to me."[179] The film aired on November 28, 2010[179] and attracted good ratings with 2.611 million viewers.[180] In December 2010 Hilton launched her own motorcycle team.[181][182] In November 2011, her Spanish driver Maverick Vinales won the final race and come up third overall in the 125cc world championship.[183] She modeled for the second time (the first time was early 2010) at the Brazil Fashion Week in 2011.[184] In February, it was released a new collection of fragrances called the Passport collection. The perfumes are inspired by popular cities such as Paris, France; South Beach, Florida; and Tokyo, Japan,[185] The following month, she launched a footwear collection in Mexico.[186][187][188] Around that time, she launched her mobile application, which became available for iPhone and iTouch.[189] On May 12, she opened her third store in Philippines. The store is located at Abreeza Mall in Davao City and it displays bags, earrings, wallets, belts, caps and perfumes.[190]
On June 1, 2011, Oxygen's show The World According to Paris, which marked Hilton's comeback to reality television, premiered.[191] The show followed her in her daily life,[192] and attracted 409,000 viewers. Although being the highest Wednesday premiere for a show,[193] it was considered a bomb, which led to the suspicion Hilton's popularity had faded.[194] The New York Times wrote that Hilton "is an attractive woman with proven talent for marketing and self-promotion, though as a reality heroine she seems a little passé — a Sony Walkman in an iPod era, a Friendster in the age of Facebook or, to put it in context, a single-process blonde in a triple-process world", and also remarked that she "appears to have plenty of boyfriends, present and ex. Paparazzi still snap her picture. But it's hard to see how she can recapture the kind of audience she enjoyed in her heyday – even by streaming her premiere live on Facebook".[195] She appeared on the show alongside her boyfriend Cy Waits (a entrepreneur and co-owner of Tryst Nightclub and XS Nightclub in Las Vegas),[196] who she broke up with in June.[197] Hilton was named "Billion Dollar Entrepreneur" by Variety magazine and was featured on the cover.[198][199] She opened up her fourth store in the Philippines on August 18, 2011.[200][201][201][202] In September, she launched a footwear line in Istanbul, Turkey[203][204] and a Paris Hilton brand store was opened in India with plans to open 8 more stores.[205] She also modeled during Ukraine Fashion Week for designer Andre Tan in October 2011.[206]
In early 2012, she launched a new line of sunglasses in Shanghai.[207] The launch was a "huge success", she said.[208] Hilton's next project was her DJ debut at the Pop Music Festival in Brazil,[209][210] she premiered her single called "Last Night", produced by Afrojack. Having attracted extremely negative reviews after some videos were posted on YouTube and being dissed by the DJs Deadmau5,[211] Samantha Ronson,[212] and even Afrojack,[213] she gained positive reviews from DJ Poet,[214] fans and the crowd at the festival. As a whole, her set received mixed reviews.[215] Shortly after her performance, she became a trending topic on Twitter.[216] "Last Night" was later given to Pitbull, he included the song on his 2012 album, Global Warming; Pitbull's version features Havana Brown as the main vocalist. Afterwards, Hilton's footwear line was nominated for Best Celebrity Licensee of the Year at the 2012 International Licensing Excellence Awards[217] and she released her fifteen perfume, Dazzle.[218][219][220][221] Hilton appeared in a music video for Korean singer, Kim Jang-hoon.[222] The filming took place at the American resort of Malibu Beach, California from August 24 to 25, 2012. An agent for the Korean singer stated that they had considered several Hollywood stars for the lead actress role in Kim's music video, including Jessica Alba and Scarlett Johansson, as well as Hilton. However, she was finally chosen to play the role following a survey conducted by the Korean public who recognised Hilton more than the other contenders.[223] It is alleged that Hilton was paid $1 million for her appearance in the video shoot,[224][225][226] with a 3D premiere that took place in October 2012.[227]
On September 20, 2012, an audio recording of her making derogatory comments about gay people appeared on the Internet.[228][229][230] On the same day, after the backlash caused over the comments, Hilton issued an apology throughout GLAAD where she wrote she is a "huge supporter of the gay community" and labels gay people as "the strongest and most inspiring people I know".[231][232] As a result of the remarks, gay-focused channel Logo pulled a documentary about her called Paris Hilton Inc., which was scheduled to air.[233][234][235] Since that month, she has been in a relationship with Spanish model River Viiperi.[236] Hilton opened her fifth store in the city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia in early November 2012. As Mecca is considered the "holiest city in the Muslim world" and Saudi Arabia is a conservative country, a controversy regarding her personal life was generated on Twitter.[237][238][239] In early December, she modeled for designers Shane and Falguni Peacock at India Fashion Week.[240][241][242] She also made a performance as a DJ there.[243] Like her debut, the set was met negatively after a video was posted on YouTube but received acclaim from the audience.[244][245]
In January 2013, Hilton started to appear in various episodes of the Danish version of the reality show Paradise Hotel, for which she was allegedly paid $300,000.[246] She then had guest-appearances in two episodes of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, where her aunts Kyle and Kim have the leads.[247][248] On April 24, Hilton opened a store in Bogotá, Colombia, making it the 44th Paris Hilton store worldwide. While promoting the store, Hilton expressed that she considers herself a creative businesswoman, having several product lines such as bags, sunglasses, perfumes and shoes, and numerous fashion stores around the world.[249][250] Hilton also said that although being an heiress to a wealthy family, she has worked since she was a teenager.[251][252] In early May, it was premiered the music video of Birdman's song "Tapout", where she appeared alongside Lil Wayne, Christina Milian and Nicki Minaj.[253]
Hilton had a small role as herself in Sofia Coppola's The Bling Ring,[254][255][256] a film about a group of teenagers who robbed the houses of celebrities such as Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and Orlando Bloom between 2008 and 2009.[257] The movie premiered at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival,[258][259] and opened theatrically on June 14.[260][261] Besides appearing in the motion picture, she, more significantly, lent Coppola her actual house to film in for two weeks so that the director could re-create the burglaries onscreen.[262][263][264][265][266] In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Hilton said that Coppola loved her house when she went to one of her birthday parties before shooting the movie and ask her to use it for filming.[267] Recalling walking through the house, Coppola said: "It was like we have to get this into the movie. It was so unique. It would be hard to recreate that. She is larger than life and her house is like Paris World."[268] The movie received critical acclaim[269] and was a success at the box office in its opening weekend, grossing $210,000 in five theaters.[270]
In May 2013, it was reported that Hilton had signed with Cash Money Records with plans to release her second album sometime in 2013.[271][272] The album features collaborations with RedOne, Snoop Dogg and Flo Rida.[273] Hilton told Rolling Stone, "I'm working with so many talented and awesome people for my album and can't wait to share more of the music".[273] Hilton also described her upcoming album as "very eclectic" and will be an full length album.[274]
Hilton filmed the music video for the album's lead single, "Good Time" featuring rapper Lil Wayne on July 23, 2013.[275] The music video for the song was released on October 7, 2013.[276] "Good Time" debuted at number 18 on the US Billboard Hot Dance/Electronic Songs.[277] During the month of August, she was a DJ at Amnesia nightclub's weekly "Foam & Diamonds" parties in Ibiza, Spain.[278][279][280] The reaction from critics and audiences alike was so positive that her contract was renewed for 2014.[281][282][283][284][285] On September 11, 2013, it was announced that Hilton will be a guest Housemate in the fifth season of VIP Brother Bulgaria, the celebrity edition of the Big Brother format.[286][287][288] She released a teaser video for an upcoming song Never Be Alone which is rumoured to be the second single off of her anticipated second album.
Although being already a fixture in entertainment news for her heavy-party lifestyle,[289] she gained significant notoriety for her participation in 1 Night in Paris, a sex tape that was leaked before the premiere episode of her reality show The Simple Life, which aired to high ratings.[290] Some entertainment writers felt the overnight success of Hilton was spawned by the whole tape controversy.[291] Entertainment Weekly commented: "I dare say the Paris Hilton-Rick Salomon tape received more print and television coverage in a week than the run-up to The Simple Life received in the months since its premiere was announced. We in the media have become Paris-ites".[292] People magazine wrote that the show "no doubt was helped by the very public saga of a pirated three-year-old video tape, which recently made the rounds on the Internet showing Hilton engaged in various sex acts with ex-boyfriend Rick Salomon".[32] As a result, Hilton's profile was raised significantly, paparazzi began following her, and her relationships, lavish lifestyle and legal issues became frequent targets of gossip sites and tabloid media worldwide—for which critics suggest that Hilton epitomizes the title of famous for being famous[3] and she is an example of the modern phenomenon of the "celebutante", the celebrity who rises to fame not because of their talent or work but because of their inherited wealth and controversial lifestyle.
Hilton ranked at 59, 23, 34 and 35 in FHM's 100 "Sexiest Women" poll in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2012 respectively.[293][294][295] She was featured as #20 and #38 in Maxim magazine's "Hot 100" list in 2005 and 2006.[296][297] In a poll conducted by the Associated Press and AOL, Hilton was voted the second "Worst Celebrity Role Model of 2006", behind Britney Spears.[298] New York Daily News gossip columnist Lloyd Grove banned her from his page and the Associated Press conducted what they called an experiment in February 2007, trying not to report on Hilton for a whole week.[299] In May of that year, she denied proclaiming herself as the "iconic blonde of the decade" such as Diana, Princess of Wales, and Marilyn Monroe in Harper's Bazaar magazine.[300] She then appeared in the 2007 Guinness World Records as the world's "Most Overrated Celebrity".[301][302]
However, during 2009, a quiet free relationship between Hilton and tabloid headlines led entertainment writers surmise Hilton's popularity had plummeted. In an article from CNN called "Why has Paris Hilton disappeared?", editor Samantha Yanks (of Gotham and Hamptons magazines) was quoted saying: "Phase one was the ascension, seemingly out of nowhere. That came with a media frenzy, the antics, the partying, the music, the babe-like status and of course, the fashion label. Phase two, she disappears".[303] The absence of Hilton in the news and tabloids seemed to be a response to a new generation of tabloid consumers' lack of interest in her.[303] The suspicion of her star power fading came back in June 2011, when her reality show, The World According to Paris, failed to get high ratings. As a result, Hilton walked out during an interview with Good Morning America, after she was asked if she worried about her moment having passed.[304][305]
In 2011, she was named one of the "100 Hottest Women of All-Time" by Men's Health,[306] and according to a poll conducted by Ipsos, Hilton is the most unpopular celebrity among Americans, with 60% of the responders having an unfavorable opinion on her.[307] In 2012, she ranked at number five in the "Most Over-exposed" list by Forbes, observing that Hilton "is another star who hasn't been on magazine covers for a long time. But she was so ubiquitous at one point that the public still views her as overexposed."[308][309] On the May 2, 2013 episode of The Wendy Williams Show, Hilton addressed about her presence in the news circuit, saying that she was simply "staying out of trouble" and that she has grown up.[310] However, following her small appearance in The Bling Ring (2013), writer Nancy Jo Sales stated that Hilton was "enjoying a little comeback"[311] and shortly after the premiere of the movie at the Cannes Film Festival, her deal with Cash Money Records led her to become a trending topic worldwide on Twitter.[312] With her recent work, media outlets have noted that 2013 is Hilton's "pop culture renaissance" year.[313] Birdman, the co-founder of the label, said that her deal "being so talked about shows the strength of her popularity."[314]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Socialite Paris Hilton was born on February 17, 1981 in New York City into the Hilton family and, along with her three younger siblings, is heir-apparent to the vast Hilton hotel and real estate dynasty. Her childhood was spent in palatial dwellings in the priciest neighborhoods on both coasts and featured a brief flirtation with the educational system, including high schooling at the ultra-exclusive Dwight School, from which she dropped out and ultimately earned her high school GED.Living the glitzy socialite life from a relatively early age, attending exclusive parties and being covered by the gossip press, Hilton apparently became hooked on obtaining celebrity status, which was perhaps furthered by the example of her mother, Kathy Hilton, who had a brief acting career herself, mostly on TV. Hilton began a remarkable and well-financed campaign to put herself in the public eye, on screen, on television and in music. This effort has included a substantial amount of physical alteration. A naturally pleasant-looking girl, Hilton underwent extensive plastic surgery, hair coloring and tinted contact lenses in her attempt to reinvent herself as "hot". Sadly, money could not buy alteration of the physical attribute she most dislikes about herself: her exceptionally-large feet.Some skeptics have guessed that the endless parade of inane inter-celebrity feuds centering around Hilton are, in fact, publicity stunts, another front in the campaign to keep her exposure level high. It has even been argued that the infamous home video of Hilton with then-boyfriend Rick Salomon, in which Hilton performs explicit romantic activities with Rick Salomon, was part of this campaign as well. If it was, it worked. For better or for worse, it made Hilton a household name overnight, and was even widely marketed as a video, 1 Night in Paris (2004).Eventually Hilton's efforts paid off and she got some modeling work, the designers presumably relying on her notoriety. She has been an increasing presence on-screen too, in TV commercials, on TV series and in the movies, at first bit parts in movies such as Zoolander (2001), Wonderland (2003), Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat (2003) and guest-star roles on TV shows such as The O.C. (2003) and George Lopez (2002), but later more substantial roles in horror flick House of Wax (2005), the direct-to-DVD Bottoms Up (2006) and her own TV show, the fish-out-of-water reality series The Simple Life (2003).Hilton also has plans to become a player in the music business, has recorded an album and even started her own music label, Heiress Records, in order to release it.Hilton is widely scorned for what some see as her narcissism, shallow intellect and materialism and for other things besides, but she seems to be aware of the old adage that there's no such thing as bad publicity and it should be evident even to her detractors that she is ambitious and driven to achieve, rather than simply basking in her family's vast fortune, as do so many other socialites. In fact, performing is only part of her many activities and she has dabbled in designing, writing (one hastens to add, with a professional writer on the team), nightclub management and even marketing video games - all of which feature Paris Hilton, front and center.
      Announced she would live on a farm for a new fish-out-of-water "reality" show called The Simple Life (2003).

      She wears a size 11 shoe. Many top designers don't make their shoes in an 11, so they have them custom made just for her.
      Was a victim of a serious hacking incident, where her T-Mobile address book, notes and private photographs taken with a camera phone were released on the Internet. The address book revealed hotel and airline preferences and exposed private phone numbers and e-mail addresses for numerous celebrities and other Hollywood elite.

      I went to Wal-Mart for the first time. I always thought they sold wallpaper. I didn't realise it has everything. You can get anything you want there for really, really cheap.
      I think the biggest misconception about me is that I'm this spoiled brat. But I'm not. I'm the total opposite.
      I desperately hate one thing about my body. I have size 11 feet. Yeah, it sucks, because I see all these super cute shoes in the stores: Guccis, YSLs, Manolos. And when they bring them out in my size, they look like clown shoes.
      The only person who really knows me is Nicky [Nicky Hilton]. And not many people know this, but my sister is one of the funniest people you'll ever meet.
      [Newsweek interview, June 2005]: I thought it was cute to play a dumb blonde. On TV, I do it because it's funny. I consider myself a businesswoman and a brand. I don't enjoy going out anymore. It's such a pain. It's everyone saying, "Let's do a deal! Can I have a picture?" I'm just, like, "These people are such losers. I can't believe I used to love doing this".
      I have always had a voice and always known I could sing, but I was too shy to let it come out. I think that is the hardest thing you can do, to sing in front of people. When I finally let go and did it, I realised it is what I am most talented at and what I love to do the most.
      Once you hear the music, you can't knock it. I go to clubs and I play it and don't tell anyone it's me. If everyone knew "This is Paris Hilton", they'd stop and judge.
      I've had a lot of stalker incidents and I usually can handle them, but the scariest one was when a guy turned up at my dad's office and said he was my fiancé.
      I'm the nicest, most loyal person in the world when it comes to my friends. I would really do almost anything to make sure they're happy.But I only want friends who are there for me just like I'm there for them. Otherwise it's too painful.
      I brought Nicole [Nicole Richie] on to The Simple Life (2003) and, all of a sudden, she became this different person. She dropped her old friends and she's someone else.
      Nicole [Nicole Richie] and I are not enemies, but I can't be friends with someone who doesn't want good things for me.
      I'm serious about acting and I have a bunch of movies lined up. I think I can become a good actress. It's something I want to prove to myself and to other people. I feel I'm getting better and feeling more confident about what I can do as an actress.
      There's nobody in the world like me. I think every decade has an iconic blonde, like Marilyn Monroe or Princess Diana and, right now, I'm that icon.
      I can't walk the streets. It's too embarrassing. I don't want to go out anymore. I don't want to party.
      I take my dog Tinkerbell seriously. I take my job seriously. But I don't take myself all that seriously.
      [on South Park: Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset (2004)] I haven't seen it, but when people copy you, that's like the most flattering thing, so whatever people can say, I just laugh about it. It doesn't matter to me.
      The best thing about having your own nightclub is that everything's free and you can tell the DJ to play whatever you want.
      [on her planned space flight in 2009] I'm very scared to do it. What if I don't come back? With the whole light-years thing, what if I come back 10,000 years later, and everyone I know is dead? I'll be like: "Great. Now I have to start all over".
      [on having natural brown eyes and wearing blue colored contact lenses]: I'm a brand, an entertainer. The brand Paris Hilton is like a fantasy life. I think people think of me as like an American princess fantasy. I want to be an icon. It's just something I always wanted to be. Madonna is an icon and just amazing. The color of my eyes is part of the image I want.
=======================================================
The daughter of Richard Hilton and the actress Kathy Richards, Paris Whitney is the oldest of four children. Together with her three siblings, Nicky, Barron Hilton II and Conrad Hilton III, she is heir to the considerable Hilton fortune which has been built on a successful real estate and hotel business.
Acting is in Paris’s blood. Not only is her mother an actress, she is also the niece of two popular child stars of the 1970s, Kim Richards and Kyle Richards, who featured in the movie, Escape to Witch Mountain and TV shows as Little House On The Prairie and ER. Paris is also related to the famous Hungarian actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, who was married to Paris’s great grandfather, Conrad Hilton. She is also distantly related to the famous movie star Elizabeth Taylor, who was briefly married to Paris Hilton’s great uncle, Conrad Nicholson Hilton Jr.
Paris was born with the proverbial “silver spoon in her mouth”, and spent her childhood moving between five-star luxury homes. These included a suite at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, New York, as well as mansions in exclusive Beverly Hills and the Hamptons. At present, she lives in a $10 million house in the Hollywood Hills which she shares with her sister. Paris attended her freshman year of high school at the Marywood-Palm Valley School in California, before continuing her studies at the Dwight School in New York.
Paris Hilton is no stranger to the limelight, and has been in the public eye since childhood. She began modeling as a child, initially at charitable functions. In 2000, she signed up with Donald Trump’s modeling agency, T Management. She also worked with other top agencies, including Ford Models Management in New York, and Model 1 Agency in London. She has fronted leading advertising campaigns such as Christian Dior and Tommy Hilfiger, and was soon christened “New York’s leading IT girl”.
Not content with her modeling career, Paris was anxious to make her debut in show business, with television likely to offer the best platform for her talents. In 2003, she teamed up with her long-time friend Nicole Richie to star in the 2003 Fox TV hit reality series, The Simple Life. For the purposes of the programme, the two girls tried their hand at a variety of blue-collar jobs, and started out by living with a family on their farm in rural Arkansas. The series showed the girls hanging out with the local boys, working at their manual jobs, and performing all sorts of menial everyday tasks, which were clearly at odds with their luxurious upbringing and lifestyle! The Simple Life was such a big hit that it was promptly followed by three more series, respectively subtitled: Road Trip, Interns and ‘Til Death Us Do Part.
Paris as also appeared in cameo and supporting roles in several feature films, including House Of Wax (2005), The Hillz (2004), Raising Helen (2004) and Nine Lives (2002). Paris’s small but significant role in House of Wax won the Teen Choice Award for Best Scream, as well as nominations for Choice Breakout Award - Female, and Best Frightened Performance at the MTV Movie Awards in 2006. She has also made cameo appearances in The cat in The Hat (2003), Wonderland (2003) and Win A Date With Tad Hamilton! (2004).
She landed her first lead roles in the straight-to-DVD films 'National Lampoon's Pledge This' and 'Bottoms Up' in 2006.
This was followed by a positively-acclaimed role in Goth/rock musical 'Repo! The Genetic Opera' in 2008. Paris sung and acted as the character Amber Sweet, a surgery and pain-killer addict.The same year, she played the hottie in the box office flop 'The Hottie and the Nottie' before guest-starring in an episode of 'My Name is Earl'. She also produced and starred in a new reality show called 'Paris Hilton: My New BFF', which premiered in the US on 30 September 2008.It made its UK debut on 29 January 2009 and ran for a second season before being cancelled. She appeared in the TV movie 'Rex' and played an ancient god in an episode of the fifth season of 'Supernatural'.Eric Kripke, Supernatural's creator and executive producer, said: "Paris Hilton is playing a demonic creature that takes the form of... Paris Hilton."In 2010, she lent her voice to Bella in 'The Dog Who Saved Christmas Vacation', before the Oxygen Channel commissioned another reality show starring Paris.'The World According to Paris' followed the heiress in her everyday life. After premiering in June 2011, it was cancelled due to low ratings.
Paris’s rise to fame has not been without its share of controversy. In 2004, she was the co-star of One Night in Paris, an unauthorized sex video, which she made with her former boyfriend Rick Salomon. Paris even received a director’s credit on the video, but she later sued Salomon for releasing the tape for sale on the internet. The couple eventually settled out of court. According to press reports, Paris received $400,000 from the video, but claimed she had never intended it to be a commercial venture and said she thought thatSalomon should donate the proceeds to charity.
Paris has also appeared in several music videos, including Just Lose It by Eminem, It Girl by John Oates (of Hall & Oates) and Caught Up In The Rapture by Won-G with Giselle. She also has her own TV channel on YouTube, which is currently the 34th most subscribed channel of all time on the service, with over 10,000 subscriptions and 2,000,000 views.
As well as her movie and TV career, Paris has a wide range of other business interests. In 2004, she founded Heiress Records, a sub-label of Warner Bros Records. So far, the label has only released her own record, Paris, but she claims that she will be signing other artists in the future. She began work on her album in 2004, and when it was released in August 2006, it entered the charts at number six. The album features a range of genres, including hip-hop, pop and reggae, together with the work of leading producers such as Greg Wells, Kara DioGuardi and Scott Storch. Her other business ventures include publishing, fashion and even mobile gaming.
In autumn 2004, Paris released a book entitled Confessions of An Heiress: A Tongue-in-Cheek Peek behind the Pose, which she wrote in conjunction with author Merle Ginsberg. The book is lavishly illustrated with pictures of Paris, and contains a string of hints on how to live like the rich and famous. It was reported that Paris received a $100,000 advance for the book, and it soon made its way into the New York Times bestseller list despite being panned by the critics. She followed it up with a sequel, also written with Merle Ginsberg, called Your Heiress Diary: Confess It All To Me”, which encourages readers to note their goals, friends and family, boyfriends, and the celebrities they admire! 
In May 2004, Paris unveiled her own brand of perfume in conjunction with Parlux Fragrances. “It’s really hot…I mixed all these scents together….it smells so good,” she revealed. Naturally, the perfume was destined to be called Paris Hilton. The perfume was so successful that the manufacturers decided to follow it up with a second Paris Hilton fragrance, called Just Me. A men’s fragrance, Heir by Paris Hilton has also been launched by Parlux.
Paris has also tried her hand at fashion, and helped design a collection of handbags for the Samantha Thavasa label in Tokyo. She has also helped launch a line of jewelry called The Paris Hilton Collection on Amazon.com. This was soon followed by a collection of watches, launched in November 2005 at the Tourneau store in New York. The 18-carat white gold and diamond-encrusted watches start at a mere $100,000.
Also in 2005, Paris launched her own chain of night-clubs, known as Club Paris. The first nightclub was opened in Orlando, Florida and has proved to be a great success. A second club was opened in Jacksonville, Florida and Paris is hoping to open further clubs in Las Vegas, New York City, Los Angeles, Miami and Cancun, Mexico.
Despite her flourishing media and business career, Paris’s personal life has been marked by controversy and scandal. In autumn 2006, she was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol, although Paris claimed that she had only had one cocktail to drink, and that the high level of alcohol in her blood was due to the fact that she had not eaten all day. She is also reported to have told the arresting officers that she was speeding to get to a local burger restaurant so that she could eat! She was back in court a few months later, when the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office claimed that she had violated the terms of her probation by driving on a suspended license.
On May 4, 2007 Hilton was sentenced by Judge Michael T. Sauer to 45 days in jail for violating her probation. On June 3, 2007, after attending the 2007 MTV Movie Awards, Hilton reported to the Men's Central Jail of the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in Los Angeles. From there, she was transferred by authorities to a special section "reserved for police officers, public officials, celebrities and other high-profile inmates" in Lynwood.
Three days later, LA County Sheriff Lee Baca signed orders reassigning Hilton to 40 days of home confinement with an electronic monitoring device due to an unspecified medical condition. However, the same day Hilton was released from jail, Judge Sauer ordered her to reappear back in his court the following morning (June 8) as the sentencing statement had explicitly said she would serve time in jail with "No work furlough. No work release. No electronic monitoring".
At the hearing he declined to be briefed by Hilton's lawyer in private chambers on the nature of her condition and sent her back to jail to serve out her original 45-day sentence. Upon hearing the sentence, Hilton shouted, "It's not right!" and started screaming requesting to hug her mother. She was later moved to the medical wing of the Twin Towers Correctional Facility.
The socialite was finally released from jail on June 26, 2007. In total Hilton had served 22 days in detention, counting her day-long home confinement. She later described her experience as traumatic and pledged to cut down on her 'superficial' life of partying and use her fame to create a halfway house for her fellow inmates.
Paris Hilton has had quite a few ups and downs in her love-life too. She has been linked romantically with several high-profile men, including male fashion model Jason Shaw, to whom she was briefly engaged in 2002. In May 2005, she announced her engagement to Paris Latsis, the heir to a Greek shipping fortune. They split soon after and she began dating Stavros Niarchos III, who was also the heir to a Greek shipping dynasty. In July 2006, Hilton announced in the world’s press that she was going to remain celibate for one full year! “Every time I have a boyfriend, I’m just so romantic, and I put all my energy into the guy”, she told reporters. Inevitably she was snapped by the Hollywood paparazzi kissing Brandon Davis a short while later.
In early 2008, she was seen with Good Charlotte guitarist Benji Madden and declared her intention to marry him in May 2008. However, they broke up in November that year.Paris started an on/off relationship with 'The Hills' star Doug Reinhardt in February 2009 but this relationship permanently finished in April 2010. She then dated entrepreneur and nightclub owner Cy Waits until June 2011.She is currently dating DJ Afrojack.
Paris endured her most famous public bust-up with longtime friend and TV co-star, Nicole Richie. In April 2005, amid media reports that their friendship was in trouble, Paris released a statement saying, “It‘s no big secret that Nicole and I are no longer friends.” But the reasons for the bust-up remained unclear. In 2006, Paris told a reporter that she and Nicole “grew apart because of fame” and added, “It’s hard to be friends with someone who doesn’t want good things for you.” Rumours abounded that Paris was jealous of Nicole’s rising fame; others speculated that a quarrel over a boyfriend was to blame.
However reconciliation was on the cards following an amusing incident in the summer of 2006 as escorts at a function tried their utmost to prevent the two stars from seeing each other, even though they were both taking part in the same public event. In October 2006, the two friends finally resolved their differences, and became good friends again.
In OK! Magazine in March 2007, Nicole Richie said, “Finally Paris and I crossed paths. The escorts were really trying to make it so we didn’t see each other. It was ridiculous. When we ended up talking again, we recapped that night and laughed.”

"I grew up in a world of unpredictability and violence. I learned to take care of myself because no one else would. I learned to lie, to conceal and to cover my fear with anger and violence." Raised on Fear is a true story by Lee Cox. A self healing, must-read. Buy today and get free shipping.
From Chapter One – “I grew up in a world of violence and unpredictability. I learned to protect myself the best I could. I learned to take care of myself because no one else would. I learned to lie, to conceal, and to cover my fear with anger and violence.
No one knew the abuse that went on in our home, as we all learned to keep it hidden. No one knew my wish to make it stop. And later, no one knew the fear that overwhelmed me and drove me to hit and hurt the ones I loved most.”
This book exposes the thinking, beliefs and actions of a child who grows up to find himself being the abuser in his family. We follow his story from before childhood to the beginning of his journey to stop his violent and abusive behaviors.
Lee Cox offers powerful insights into his journey of healing himself. When he shares his story, his courage, candor and honesty inspire his audience to help stop domestic abuse. Lee speaks to: Students, Teachers, Law Enforcement, Domestic Violence Professionals, Civic organizations, Self Help groups and Community Leaders. Contact the EVE Foundation to have Lee speak at your next event.
