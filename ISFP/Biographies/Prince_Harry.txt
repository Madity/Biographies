Prince Harry[1] (Henry Charles Albert David;[fn 1] formally styled Prince Henry of Wales; born 15 September 1984), known as Captain Harry Wales in his military role, is the younger son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. His paternal grandparents are Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He stands fourth in line to succeed his grandmother as monarch of the Commonwealth realms, preceded by his father, elder brother Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and nephew Prince George of Cambridge.
After an education at schools in the United Kingdom and spending parts of his gap year in Australia and Lesotho, Harry chose a military career, undergoing officer training at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Blues and Royals of the Household Cavalry Regiment, serving temporarily with his brother, and completed his training as a troop leader. In 2007–2008 he served for 77 days in Helmand, Afghanistan.[2] but he was pulled out following publication of the story in an Australian magazine.[3] He returned to Afghanistan for a 20-week deployment in 2012–2013 with the Army Air Corps.[4]
Harry was born at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, England, on 15 September 1984.[5] He was baptised on 21 December 1984 at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie. His godparents were The Duke of York (his paternal uncle); Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones (his paternal cousin once removed); Lady Vestey; Mrs William Bartholomew; Bryan Organ; and Gerald Ward, a former officer in the Household Cavalry.[6][7]
Diana wanted Harry and his older brother William to have a broader range of experiences than previous royal children and took them to venues that ranged from Disney World and McDonald's to AIDS clinics and shelters for the homeless.[8] Harry began to accompany his parents on official visits at an early age; his first overseas royal tour was with his parents to Italy in 1985.[9]
Harry's parents divorced in 1996, and his mother died following a car accident in Paris the following year. Harry and William were staying with their father at Balmoral at the time, and the Prince of Wales told his sons about their mother's death.[10] At his mother's funeral, Harry, then 12, accompanied his father, brother, paternal grandfather, and maternal uncle, Earl Spencer in walking behind the funeral cortège from Kensington Palace to Westminster Abbey.[11]
Like his father and brother, Harry was educated at independent schools. He started at Jane Mynors' nursery school and the pre-preparatory Wetherby School, both in London.[12] Following this, he attended Ludgrove School, and, after passing the entrance exams, was admitted to Eton College, where he studied geography, art history, and art at A-Level. The decision to place Harry at Eton went against the Windsor family tradition of sending children to Gordonstoun (Harry's grandfather, father, two uncles, and two cousins all attended); it did make Harry follow in the Spencer family footsteps, as both Diana's father and brother had attended Eton.[8]
In June 2003, Harry completed his education at Eton with two A-Levels[13] (achieving a grade B in art and D in Geography) having decided to drop history of art after AS level.[14] He excelled in sports, particularly polo and rugby union.[15] Passing two A-levels, Harry was eligible to apply for an officer commission in the British Army.[16]
After school, Harry took a gap year, during which he spent time in Australia, working (as his father had done in his youth) on a cattle station and participating in the Young England vs Young Australia Polo Test Match.[17] He also travelled to Lesotho, where he worked with orphaned children and produced the documentary film The Forgotten Kingdom.[8]
Harry entered the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst on 8 May 2005, where he was known as Officer Cadet Wales, and joined the Alamein Company.[18] Within a year, in April 2006, Harry completed his officer training and was commissioned as a Cornet (second lieutenant) in the Blues and Royals, a regiment of the Household Cavalry in the British Army. He was given the service number 564673.[19] On 13 April 2008, when he reached two years' seniority, Harry was promoted to lieutenant.[20]
The British Ministry of Defence and Clarence House made a joint announcement on 22 February 2007 that Harry would be deployed with his regiment to Iraq, as part of the 1st Mechanised Brigade of the 3rd Mechanised Division – a move supported by Harry, who had stated that he would leave the army if he was told to remain in safety while his regiment went to war;[21] he said: "There's no way I'm going to put myself through Sandhurst and then sit on my arse back home while my boys are out fighting for their country."[22] The head of the British army at the time, General Sir Richard Dannatt, first said on 30 April 2007 that he had personally decided that Harry would serve with his unit in Iraq,[23] and Harry was scheduled for deployment in May or June 2007, to patrol the Maysan Province.[24] By 16 May, however, Dannatt announced that Prince Harry would not serve in Iraq;[25] concerns included Harry being a high-value target (as several threats by various groups had already been made against him) and the dangers the soldiers around him would face should any attempt be made on Harry's life or capture. Clarence House made public Harry's disappointment with the decision, though he said he would abide by it.[26]
It was reported in early June 2007 that Harry had arrived in Canada to train alongside soldiers of the Canadian Forces and British Army, at CFB Suffield, near Medicine Hat, Alberta. It was said that this was in preparation for a tour of duty in Afghanistan, where Canadian and British forces were participating in the NATO-led Afghan War;[27] rumours that were confirmed in February the following year, when the British Ministry of Defence revealed that Harry had secretly been deployed as a Forward Air Controller to Helmand Province in Afghanistan.[28] The revelation came after the media – notably, the German newspaper Bild and Australian magazine New Idea[29][not in citation given][30] – breached the blackout placed over the information by the Canadian and British authorities. It was later reported that, while in Afghanistan, Harry had helped Gurkha troops repel an attack from Taliban insurgents,[31][not in citation given] and performed patrol duty in hostile areas.[32][not in citation given] His tour made Harry the first member of the Royal Family to serve in a war zone since his uncle, The Duke of York, flew helicopters during the Falklands War. For his service, Harry was presented with an Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan by his aunt The Princess Royal, at the Combermere Barracks in May 2008.[33]
In October 2008, it was announced that Harry was to follow his brother, father and uncle in learning to fly military helicopters. After passing the initial aptitude test, he was to undertake a month-long course; if he passed that, he would begin full flight training in early 2009.[34] Harry had to pass his flying assessment at the Army Air Corps Base (AAC), Middle Wallop, the result of which determined if he would pass on to train as a pilot of the Apache, Lynx, or Gazelle helicopter.[35] Having reached the requisite standard, Harry attended the Defence Helicopter Flying School at RAF Shawbury, where he joined brother William.[36]

Harry was presented with his flying brevet (wings) by his father on 7 May 2010 at a ceremony at the Army Air Corps Base (AAC), Middle Wallop. Harry had let it be known that he intended to fly Apache attack helicopters if he was successful in passing the rigorous Apache training course, after which time it could be possible for him to see active military service once again on the frontline in Afghanistan.[37] During the ceremony, he switched his Blues and Royals' Officer's Service Dress cap for that of the Army Air Corps' sky blue beret with a Blues and Royals badge.
On 10 March 2011, it was revealed that Harry had passed his Apache flying test and he was awarded his Apache Flying Badge on 14 April 2011.[citation needed] There was speculation that he would return to Afghanistan before the withdrawal in 2015. On 16 April 2011, it was announced that Harry had been promoted to captain.[38]
In June 2011, Clarence House announced that on completion of his training conversion course to use Apache helicopters in the war arena, Harry would be available for deployment, including in current operations in Afghanistan, as an Apache helicopter pilot.[citation needed] The final decision will ultimately rest with the Ministry of Defence's senior commanders, including principally the Chief of the Defence Staff in consultation with the wishes of Harry, the Prince of Wales and the Queen.[39] In October, Harry was transferred to a US military base in California to complete his helicopter gunship training. This final phase will include live-fire training and "environmental and judgment training" at naval and air force facilities in California and Arizona. The majority of those completing the two-month Apache training are deployed to the front lines in Afghanistan.[40] In the same month, it was reported that Harry was said to be a natural pilot who was top of his class in the extensive training he had undertaken at the Naval Air Facility, El Centro, California.[41] On November 2011, Harry returned to England. He went to Wattisham Flying Station in Suffolk, in the east of England, to complete his training to fly Apache helicopters.[42]
On 7 September 2012 he arrived at Camp Bastion in southern Afghanistan as part of the 100-strong 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment, Army Air Corps,[43] to begin a four-month combat tour as a co-pilot and gunner for an Apache helicopter.[44] This was considered a particular honour as most pilots are required to sit in the "back seat" before being promoted to gunner. On 10 September, within days of arriving in Afghanistan, it was reported that the Taliban threatened his life. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid spoke to Reuters and was quoted as saying; "We are using all our strength to get rid of him, either by killing or kidnapping," and "We have informed our commanders in Helmand to do whatever they can to eliminate him."[45][46]
It was announced on 21 January 2013 that Harry was returning from a 20-week deployment in Afghanistan,[4] where he served as an Apache co-pilot/gunner.
On 8 July 2013, the Ministry of Defence announced that Harry had successfully qualified as an Apache aircraft commander.[47]
On 17 January 2014, the Ministry of Defence announced that Harry had completed his attachment to 3 Regiment Army Air Corps and will take up a staff officer role at the position of SO3 (Defence Engagement) in HQ London District. His responsibilities will include helping to co-ordinate significant projects and commemorative events involving the Army in London. He will be based at Horse Guards in central London.[48]
On March 6, 2014, Prince Harry launched Invictus Games, a Paralympic-style sporting event for injured servicemen and women, will be held on September 10–14, 2014.[49] Prince Harry met British hopefuls for the Invictus Games at Tedworth House for the start of the selection process Invictus Games on April 29, 2014.[50] On May 5, 2014, Harry attended a ticket sale launch for Invictus Games at BT Tower, where he made a public tweet on the Invictus Games official Twitter account as the President of Invictus Games.[51]
At the age of 21, Harry was appointed as a Counsellor of State and began his duties in that capacity when the Queen was attending the 2005 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta. The following year, Harry was in Lesotho to visit again Mants'ase Children's Home near Mohale's Hoek, which he first toured in 2004 and, along with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, launched Sentebale: The Princes' Fund for Lesotho, a charity to aid children orphaned by HIV/AIDS. He has granted his patronage to organisations including WellChild, Dolen Cymru, and MapAction.[52] To aid Sentebale, and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund and Centrepoint, Harry and his brother organised the Concert for Diana at Wembley Stadium, on 1 July 2007.
Sport has been a way that Harry has helped charities and other organisations, such as training as a Rugby Development Officer for the Rugby Football Union in 2004 and coaching students in schools to encourage them to learn the sport. He has participated in polo matches, like his brother and father, to raise money for charitable causes.[17]
On 6 January 2009, the Queen granted Harry and William their own royal household. It has three main staff members, supported by a "small" team. Sir David Manning, the former British ambassador to Washington, is a part-time adviser to the princes. Previously, William and Harry's affairs had been handled by the office of their father at Clarence House in central London. The new household released a statement, complete with their own cyphers at the top, announcing that they have established their own office at nearby St James's Palace to look after their public, military and charitable activities.[53] Harry's cypher is similar to his brother's, but with an H in a shade of blue similar to that used by his mother. In September 2009, William and Harry set up The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry to enable the princes to take forward their charitable ambitions. The foundation is the culmination of the princes' charitable lives so far.[54][55][56]
In March 2012, Harry led an official visit to Belize as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.[57] He continued to the Bahamas and Jamaica, where the Prime Minister, Portia Simpson-Miller, is considering severing ties between Jamaica and the constitutional monarchy.[58] He next visited Brazil to attend the GREAT Campaign,[59] as an ambassador of the 2012 Olympics to the 2016 Rio Olympics. On 12 August 2012, Harry represented the Queen at the Closing Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.[60]
From 9 to 15 May 2013, Harry was on an official visit to the United States. The tour promoted the rehabilitation of injured American and UK troops, publicised his own charities and supported British interests. It included engagements in Washington DC, Denver, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. He watched the opening ceremony of the Warrior Games, in Colorado Springs, where injured servicemen and women competed, and met survivors of Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey.[61][62]
In Oct. 2013, Prince Harry Visited Australia for his first official visit to the country. Prince Harry attended the International Fleet Review at Sydney Harbour.[63] Also pay a visit to the Australian SAS HQ in Perth.[64] On his way back to UK, he attended a charity event for Sentebale at Dubai.[65]
In May 2014, Prince Harry visited Estonia and Italy. At Estonia he visited Freedom Square in the capital Tallinn to honour those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for their nation, and attended a reception at the Estonian Parliament,[66] and attended Nato military exercise there.[67] In Italy, Prince Harry attended commemorate the 70th anniversary of Monte Cassino battles for the Polish, Commonwealth and British troops.[68][69][70] Prince Harry also revealed the British Pavilion at Expo Milano 2015 in Rome at the MAXXI Museum.[71]

Harry enjoys playing many sporting activities, playing competitive polo, and skiing and motocross.[17] Prince Harry is a supporter of Arsenal Football Club.[76] Harry is also a keen Rugby Union fan, and supported England's bid to host the 2015 Rugby World Cup.[77]
Harry earned a reputation in his youth for being rebellious, leading the tabloid press to label him as a "wild child."[78] He was found at age 17 smoking cannabis and partaking in under-age drinking with his friends, clashing physically with paparazzi outside nightclubs,[78] and was photographed at Highgrove House at a "Colonial and Native" themed costume party wearing a Nazi German Afrika Korps uniform with a swastika armband.[79] He later issued a public statement apologising for his behaviour.[80]
In January 2009, the British tabloid News of the World revealed a video made by Harry three years earlier in which he referred to a Pakistani fellow officer cadet as "our little Paki friend" and later called a soldier wearing a cloth on his head a "raghead". These terms were described by David Cameron as "unacceptable",[81] and by The Daily Telegraph as "racist",[81] and a British Muslim youth organisation called Harry a "thug".[82] Clarence House immediately issued an apology from Harry, who stated that no malice was intended in his remarks.[83] A former British MP and Royal Marine, Rod Richards, said that such nicknames were common amongst military comrades, stating "in the Armed Forces people often used to call me Taffy. Others were called Yankie, Oz or Kiwi or whatever. I consider Paki as an abbreviation for Pakistani. I don't think on this occasion it was intended to be offensive."[84]
While on holiday in Las Vegas in August 2012, Harry and an unknown young woman were photographed naked in a Wynn Las Vegas hotel room, reportedly during a game of strip billiards. The pictures were leaked by American celebrity website TMZ on 21 August,[85] being reported worldwide by mainstream media on 22 August.[86][87][88] The photographs were shown by the American media, but British media were reluctant to publish them[89] – royal aides suggested that Clarence House may contact the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) if the pictures are used by British publications.[90] St James's Palace confirmed that Harry was in the photographs, said that he was essentially a victim of sexting in a private moment, and contacted the Press Complaints Commission upon hearing that a number of British newspapers were considering publishing the photographs.[91] On 24 August The Sun newspaper published photographs.[92]
Polls conducted in the United Kingdom in November 2012 showed Harry to be the third most popular member of the Royal Family, after William and the Queen.[93]
Rumours have persisted that Harry might be the son of James Hewitt, with whom his mother had an affair, but this has been refuted by Hewitt and others, who point out that Harry was born before the affair began.[fn 2]
Chelsy Davy, the daughter of a South African businessman, was referred to as Harry's girlfriend in an interview conducted for his 21st birthday, and Harry said he "would love to tell everyone how amazing she is but once I start talking about that, I have left myself open...There is truth and there is lies and unfortunately I cannot get the truth across."[95] In early 2009, it was reported in the media that the pair had parted ways after knowing each other for five years.[96]
Harry was introduced to girlfriend Cressida Bonas, granddaughter of Edward Curzon, 6th Earl Howe, by his cousin Princess Eugenie in May 2012.[97] Bonas accompanied Harry to an official engagement for the first time in March 2014.[98] On 30 April 2014 it was announced that the couple had parted amicably.[99]
Harry's full style and title is His Royal Highness Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales, but he is almost always called Prince Harry. As a British prince he uses the name of the area over which his father holds title, i.e., Wales, as a territorial suffix in lieu of surname. Past precedent is that such surnames are dropped from usage in adulthood, after which either title alone or Mountbatten-Windsor is used when necessary.[100] Harry continues to use Wales as his surname for military purposes and is known as Captain Harry Wales in such contexts.[101] If his father succeeds to the throne, Harry's style will become His Royal Highness The Prince Henry. Traditionally, sons of the reigning monarch and of the Prince of Wales receive a dukedom immediately prior to marriage, the most recent being Prince William, who became Duke of Cambridge.
Harry has twice had his charitable efforts recognised by the international community. In December 2010, the German charity Ein Herz für Kinder ("Heart for Children") awarded him the Golden Heart Award, in recognition of his "charitable and humanitarian efforts".[106][107]
On his 18th birthday, Harry was granted his own personal coat of arms, consisting of the arms of the sovereign in right of the United Kingdom with a label for difference.
Quarterly 1st and 4th gules three lions passant guardant in pale or armed and langed azure 2nd or a lion rampant gules armed and langued azure within a double tressure flory counterflory of the second 3rd azure a harp or stringed argent
The whole differenced by a Label of five points Argent the first, third and fifth points charged with an Escallop Gules
As he is the grandchild of the sovereign, Harry's coat of arms has a label of five points. The escallops (seashells) allude to his mother Diana, Princess of Wales, whose Spencer coat of arms includes three escallops argent.
Harry is a male line descendant of Elimar I, Count of Oldenburg and a member of the House of Oldenburg, one of Europe's oldest royal houses, and the cadet branch known as the House of Glücksburg, founded by his paternal ancestor Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. His paternal grandmother issued letters patent on 8 February 1960 declaring Harry's future father to be a member of the United Kingdom's reigning House of Windsor and a bearer of its name. Their male line House of Oldenburg ancestors include five Danish kings — Christian I, Frederick I, Christian III, Christian IX - King George I of Greece, 11 counts of Oldenburg, two dukes of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg, five dukes of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck and one duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg.[109]
Among his other recent ancestors on his father's side are members of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the House of Battenberg, the main line of the House of Hesse-Darmstadt, the House of Hesse-Kassel and the House of Hohenzollern.[109] Among his distant ancestors are Henry IV and James II and VII. Through his father's royal family, Harry is of German,[109] English and Scottish descent, and through his mother's family, the Earl Spencer and the Baron Fermoy families, of English descent and of remote German, Irish, Scottish and British-American descent.[110]
The generations indicate descent from George I, who formalised the use of the titles prince and princess for members of the British Royal Family.

=======================================================
A dedicated soldier and keen sportsman, Harry’s reputation as an unrepentant tear-away prince was made with youthful antics that would be normal for most teenagers but gained massive coverage for a member of the Royal Family.
His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He is third in line to the British Throne after his father and his elder brother William. His full name is Henry Charles Albert David Wales, though in adult life he may take the family name Mountbatten-Windsor.
Harry was christened on 31 December, 1984, at Windsor Castle’s St George’s Chapel by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Robert Runcie. He has several godparents: his uncle, Prince Andrew, Duke of York; Lady Sarah Chatto; Lady Vestey; Mrs. William Bartholomew; Bryan Organ and Gerald Ward.
Harry’s boisterous nature was revealed early in his life, with the red-haired little boy displaying a roguish temperament. His parents were determined their boys would lead as normal a life as possible and Harry followed his older brother to Mrs Mynor’s Nursery School in Notting Hill Gate, West London and then to Wetherby School. He went to preparatory school at Ludgrove School in Wokingham.
In 1997, when Harry was just 12, he was staying at his grandmother the Queen’s Scottish estate Balmoral when his mother was killed in a car crash in Paris. Diana had been very close to her sons, involving them in her charity work and attempting to show them how the less-fortunate of the world lived. Her death affected the prince deeply and he was visibly distressed when the family emerged to view the massive collection of floral tributes and messages of sympathy mounted to the princess by the public. Harry walked with his father and brother in the funeral procession at his mother’s funeral and the sight of the young princes carrying themselves with dignity captured the approval and sympathy of the world. On Diana’s casket was a card from Harry made out to “Mummy”.
In 1998 Harry went to Eton College in Berkshire. At college he developed a keen love of sport and became particularly involved in polo, rugby, skiing and abseiling. It was while at college that Harry became embroiled in the first of several controversies. In 2002 it emerged that Harry had admitted smoking cannabis. He had been seen drinking at the Rattlebone Inn pub near his family’s estate at Highgrove, Gloucestershire and he had smoked cannabis at several of the after hours parties he hosted at the estate in the summer of 2001 when he was 16. The family did not deny the reports but stressed that Harry’s use was “experimental” and could not be described as “regular’’. A police investigation cleared Harry but his father Prince Charles spoke to his son about the dangers of drugs and sent him to a drug rehabilitation centre in south London, where he met recovering heroin and cocaine addicts.
Though not noted for his academic prowess Harry graduated Eton with two A-levels: a B in Art and a D in Geography, though this was not without controversy either. In 2004 a former art teacher at Eton, Sarah Forsythe, alleged during an employment dispute with the school that she had been asked by senior staff to help Harry cheat on his A Level work in 2003. She claimed that other staff prepared his written material and helped him insert it into his work. She also secretly taped a conversation with Harry where he said he wrote “like, a sentence in it”. Forsyth won her employment dispute but her claims about Harry were dismissed.
After leaving school Harry took a “gap year’’ and travelled throughout Africa and Australia. He worked at a Queensland ranching station as a jackeroo and followed the English rugby team in their successful World Cup challenge. In 2004, Harry went to Lesotho in southern Africa and volunteered at an AIDS orphanage. While there he made a documentary “The Forgotten Kingdom – Prince Harry in Lesotho’’ to highlight the plight of the orphans and together with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, he founded a charity called “Sentebale: The Princes’ Fund for Lesotho” in 2006.
Harry returned from Lesotho in July, 2004 to prepare for admission to The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst the following year. While preparing, Harry worked with the Rugby Football Union as an Assistant Rugby Development Officer, as well as on a farm to learn about land management. In 2004 Harry began dating Chelsy Davy, the daughter of a wealthy Zimbabwean family. The two were twice photographed holidaying in Argentina and Mozambique
In October 2004, only weeks after the allegations of Harry’s school cheating were made, Harry got into a 3am scuffle with a paparazzi photographer outside a London nightclub. Harry shoved the photographer’s camera into the man’s face and cut his lip. He was restrained by his bodyguard and bouncers from the club.
A few months later, in early 2005, Harry landed himself in hot water again by wearing a Nazi uniform to a friend’s “Colonials and Natives’’ fancy-dress party. A picture of a drunk Harry sporting a swastika armband was splashed across the front page of The Sun newspaper and an international outcry ensued, particularly as it was only weeks before Holocaust Memorial Day, the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Harry was lambasted in the press, despite making an apology, with The Guardian saying Harry “seems less interested in preparing for a life of royal service than auditioning for the role of village idiot”.
In May 2005, Harry entered Sandhurst where he was known as Officer Cadet Wales. He graduated from the academy in April, 2006 and joined the Blues and Royals regiment of the Household Cavalry as a troop commander. In February 2007 it was announced that Harry would be deployed on active service in Iraq with the prince saying, "There's no way I'm going to put myself through Sandhurst and then sit on my arse back home while my boys are out fighting for their country." Despite Harry’s willingness to serve, the Army performed an about-face and did not let him go after they received specific threats against him that would have presented a danger to those around him.He was to get his wish to take part in active service, although not in the conflict in Iraq. In June 2007, Prince Harry trained in Canada in preparation for a tour of duty of Afghanistan. He became the first member of the royal family to serve in a war zone since Prince Andrew, Duke of York, was involved in flying helicopters in the Falklands conflict. The Ministry of Defence confirmed that Harry had been sent to Afghanistan as a forward air controller to Helmand province. In May 2008, he received the Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan, for his participation in the conflict.
Away from his military career, Harry was also keeping himself busy and in July 2007, he and his brother William held the star-studded ‘Concert for Diana’ to commemorate their mother on what would have been her 46th birthday. The event raised money for charities dear to her. Harry attended with girlfriend Chelsy, despite reports he had been living it up as a playboy with various women around the world. In November, 2007, it was reported that Chelsy, exasperated with Harry’s wild ways, had split up with him, though they were reported to have reconciled two weeks later.There is currently press speculation over whether Chelsy will accompany Harry to his brother’s wedding to Kate Middleton on 29 April 2011. Despite constant scrutiny in the media, Prince Harry remains unrepentant about his party-boy image. “I am who I am and I’m not going to change,” he told an interviewer. Newspaper editors world-wide hope he stays true to his word.
Meanwhile, after several years, Prince Harry was successful in completing his military helicopter pilot training, and in May 2010, his father, Prince Charles, presented him with his flying wings at the Army Air Corps Base, in Middle Wallop. In March 2011, it was revealed that Harry had been successful in passing his Apache helicopter flying test.
Before embarking on his training, the prince had said: “It is a huge honour to have the chance to train on the Apache, which is an awesome helicopter. To be honest, I think it will be one of the biggest challenges in my life so far.”

      [on his role as a helicopter gunner in Afghanistan] Our job out here is to make sure the guys are safe on the ground, And, if that means shooting someone who is shooting at them, then we will do it.
      Conversations with my mother, father, my grandparents, as I've grown up have obviously driven me towards wanting to try and make a difference as much as possible.
      Anyone who says they don't enjoy the Army is mad - you can spend a week hating it and the next week it could be the best thing in the world and the best job you could ever, ever wish for. It has got so much to offer.
      For me personally, as I said, I want to serve my country. I've done it once, and I'm still in the army, I feel as though I should get the opportunity to do it again.
      There's a lot of times that both myself and my brother wish, obviously, that we were just completely normal.
      To be honest dinner conversations was the worst bit about being a child and listening to the boring people around me.

Birthdate: September 15, 1984Birthplace: London, EnglandPrince Harry is an adventurous and controversial member of the Royal Family. Kidzworld takes a look at the young man who’s third in line to the British throne.
Like his brother Prince William, Harry got most of his education outside the castle walls, thanks in large part to his open-minded late mother Princess Diana. The world mourned with Harry and his family when Diane died tragically in a car accident in 1997. Harry has since followed in his late mother’s philanthropic footsteps and set up a charity for African orphans in Lesotho with his fellow royal, Prince Seelso. 
Although Prince Harry has done a lot of great charity work, including working with orphaned children in Lesotho, he’s also made a name for himself in the press as a bit of a party animal. He also courted controversy when he dressed in Nazi fatigues on Halloween, but he’s since apologized for his tactless costume. 
Prince Harry was recently spotted at a rugby match rekindling his relationship with his old flame, Chelsy Davy. The two separated last year, but after some romantic flings (Harry dated TV presenter Caroline Flack and Armani PR girl Stephanie Haynes), the lovebirds have since reunited.
Prince Harry enrolled in the military and served on the front line in the Afghan War until an American website revealed his presence.
Harry was supposed to deploy in Iraq in 2007, but he had to forgo the plan when intelligence discovered an enemy plan to kidnap the prince.
