 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Ryan Gosling was born on November 12, 1980, in London, Ontario, to Thomas and Donna Gosling, and was the second of their two children. The Gosling family, moved to Cornwall, Ontario, where Ryan grew up and was home-schooled by his mother. Ryan attended Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational High School in Cornwall, where he excelled in Drama and Fine Arts. The family then relocated to Burlington, Ontario, where Ryan attended Lester B. Pearson High School in Burlington, Ontario.Ryan first performed as a singer at talent contests with his older sister Mandi. He attended an open audition in Montreal for the TV series "The Mickey Mouse Club" (MMC (1989)) in January 1993 and beat out 17,000 other aspiring actors for a a spot on the show. While appearing on "MMC" for two years, he lived with co-star Justin Timberlake's family.Though he received no formal acting training, after "MMC," Gosling segued into an acting career, appearing on the TV series Young Hercules (1998) and Breaker High (1997), as well as the films The Slaughter Rule (2002), Murder by Numbers (2002), and Remember the Titans (2000). He first attracted serious critical attention with his performance as the Jewish neo-Nazi in the controversial film The Believer (2001), which won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. He was cast in the part by writer-director Henry Bean, who believed that Gosling's strict upbringing gave him the insight to understand the character Danny, whose obsessiveness with the Judaism he was born into turns to hatred. He was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award as Best Male Lead in 2002 for the role and won the Golden Aries award from the Russian Guild of Film Critics.After appearing in the sleeper The Notebook (2004) in 2004, Gosling won the dubious honor of being named one of the 50 Hottest Bachelors by People Magazine. More significantly, he was named the Male Star of Tomorrow at the 2004 Show West convention of movie exhibitors.Gosling reached the summit of his profession with his performance in Half Nelson (2006), which garnered him an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor.

      I've learned it's important not to limit yourself. You can do whatever you really love to do, no matter what it is.
      I always wanted to entertain. When I was 6, a scrawny, scrawny kid, I'd get in my red speedo and do muscle moves. I actually thought I was muscular. I didn't know everyone was laughing at me.
      You know how sometimes department stores have these things where, if you win, you get 10 minutes and go in and take anything you want from the store? That's basically what I'm doing. I'm running in and just trying to grab as many characters as possible before they pull the plug on me.
      It's nice to be around people that have a sense of the world around them, that are, in general, more conscious and conscientious. It was important for me to get an outside look at America even though I grew up in Canada, it's an incredible country and I love it, but it's so close. It's like being too close to a Monet or something. You have to move back. Going to New Zealand helped me to get a read on this place that the whole world was obsessed with.
      I also think that something interesting comes out when you do something that you're afraid of, so I try to take things that I'm not sure that I can do. And this was certainly one of them. I didn't feel like I was right for this at all, and I wondered how to find truth in a fairy tale.
      For now, I'm just going to keep doing the work and hope I don't get fired. If people want to put me up on their walls, I'll love it.
      I think American news is pretty tragic in general. I can't tell the difference between Entertainment Tonight (1981) and the news. It's all about ratings. They are trying to sum it all up pretty quickly and try to act as if they understand it.
      The theme for me is love and the lack of it. We all want that and we don't know how to get it, and everything we do is some kind of attempt to capture it for ourselves.
      I understand the studios, in the sense that if they're going to spend $100 million on a film, they want to make sure they're gonna get that back . . . but I don't know how to guarantee you you're going to make that money back, and I'm uncomfortable working with those kind of numbers.
      There is this idea in Hollywood, and I've seen it work for people, where the unspoken rule is 'Do two for them and one for yourself.' And that's kind of considered a fact. I've never really found that to be true for me. I've gotten more opportunities out of working on things I believed in than I ever did on things that weren't special to me.
      All my characters are me. I'm not a good enough actor to become a character. I hear about actors who become the role and I think 'I wonder what that feels like'. Because for me, they're all me. I relate to these characters because aspects of their personality are like me. And I just turn up the parts of myself that are them and turn down the parts that aren't.
      (On this acting hero) Gene Wilder is my Marlon Brando. Gene Wilder will break your heart and make you laugh at the same time. And that's deep. There's something really profound about what he's able to do. It's transcendent. It's everything. He gives you everything at once and you have to decide what you feel about it.
      I mean, God bless The Notebook (2004), it introduced me to one of the great loves (Rachel McAdams) of my life. But, people do Rachel and me a disservice by assuming we were anything like the people in that movie. Rachel and my love story is a hell of a lot more romantic than that.
      [on working on independent films] - Not to discriminate against budgets, I feel that independent films tend to ask more questions and don't pretend to know as much as the bigger films, which tend to think they know everything.
      I don't really like doing interviews because I don't have any answers about why I act. It's like a compulsion. It's like people who eat and eat and eat and they don't know why and they keep getting fatter but they can't stop. It's like that.... And then you find yourself on a set throwing yourself off a bridge, and you're asking yourself, 'Why am I doing this?' And I don't know.
      I try not to make to many movies. I get sick of myself, so I can imagine how everyone else feels.
      [on "Blue Valentine"] In most movies you spend so much time looking for any scraps of truth, and in this movie you're just marinating in it.
      [After Blue Valentine (2010)] I had to go to the doctor for a physical and when I left he gave me a prescription. he wrote, 'Do a comedy'.
      [on 'Drive' director Nicolas Winding Refn] I don't think that Nicolas believes that art and entertainment are mutually exclusive. He doesn't limit himself. If he were a baseball player, it's like he walks up to the plate [and] points out a home run before he swings. He may not hit a home run, but that's the only thing he's hoping for. He's got guts. And also, he loves exploitation films and genre movies as well as art films.
      [on choosing film roles] There's always those 'Blair Witch Projects' that haunt you. The idea that you could make a little movie, and you could make it the way you want to make it, and people will still want to see it. People will want to see it for what it is, not for the way it's marketed.
      I always wanted to make a violent John Hughes movie. I love John Hughes movies. I love 'Pretty in Pink'. But I always thought if there were head-smashing in it it'd be a better movie.
      [on 'Drive'] I guess I wanted to make a superhero movie, but all the good ones were taken. This was the opportunity to create one.
      The writing was on the wall when I saw 'Rocky' for the first time. I went and picked a fight right afterwards and got my ass kicked. The movies took me into their dream.
      [on working with directors Derek Cianfrance and Nicolas Winding Refn] I found my guys I got a team I know. We're just getting started.
      [on the possibility of directing] You can't act forever. Some people manage, but they're the marathon runners. You have a shelf life as an actor, so you have to find another way to express yourself.
      [on being recognized in public] You just have to hang out in places that are more interesting than you are. It has a weird effect on people. The experience of recognizing you puts them into some kind of trance where they think they know you but they don't. They start sharing with you, and it gives you this intimacy that's very rare.
      [on Drive (2011) director Nicolas Winding Refn] I was very ill, and we were sitting there not really able to communicate. He looks at me with tears in his eyes, and he starts singing at the top of his lungs and hitting his knees, and he says, 'I know what this movie is, it's a movie about a guy who drives around listening to pop music because it's the only way he can feel.'
      I think the one thing I love most about being an adult is the right to buy candy whenever and wherever I want.
      There's no way that a film can capture the experience of making it... The thing that's so exciting when you're making a film is that it can be anything and there are no limitations on it.
      [on becoming famous] I don't know what to say about fame. I've been doing this since I was eight, so I can't really say that it came out of nowhere. But I can't say that I saw it coming either. My friend's grandmother would soak a lobster in vodka, get it good and drunk before she put it in the pot to cook it. Then she'd turn the heat up real slow. That lobster never knew what hit him.That's kind of how it's gone down for me. Except in my story, I guess I'm the old lady AND the lobster.
      When I'm down in the dumps, nothing gets my toes a-tappin' like putting on my old MC Hammer pants. And they still fit, even though my aunt made them for me when I was eight. But that's the genius of MC Hammer. They still fit me though I've grown significantly. I'll never know how MC Hammer got into money problems. Genius.
      I thank God for music. It's made me a better actor. I think acting has made me a better musician. Now, I come into a scene and I think "This guy's playing the beat." You're trying to figure out what the other actors are doing in terms of, like, Michelle Williams's got the baseline on this. And this guy's playing the drums. And this person wants the guitar solo on this song, so I'll just play some synth line. You have to figure out what your part is in the dynamic. So you're filling in a space. You're not all trying to be the lead singer.
      [on playing a bank robber in The Place Beyond the Pines (2012)] I fantasized about robbing banks for a long time, ever since I was a kid. Then, telling Derek [Cianfrance] that I'd ever I could rob a bank I'd do it on my motorcycle, and he said 'That's weird, I just wrote a script about that'. It just felt meant to be. He said that I was going to get to rob the bank for real. There would be no cuts, real people in there, real tellers. I'm going to get to ride the bike up, rob it, and ride the bank away. I was very excited.
      [2013] I've been doing it too much. I've lost perspective on what I'm doing. I think it's good for me to take a break and reassess why I'm doing it and how I'm doing it. And I think this is probably a good way to learn about that. I need a break from myself as much as I imagine the audience does.
      [on some apprehension about undertaking the role of film director] When you're a director there's no place to hide. You're completely exposed. When you're the actor, you can say, 'Well, it's the character', or 'I didn't write it', or 'I didn't direct it, cut it, score it. I didn't make that poster'. You can hide behind a lot of things. Whereas, as a filmmaker you're responsible for everything.
      I'm really not good at knowing what people want, because don't have that talent. If ever I try to predict, I'm sure I will be instantly humbled.
      [on his role as Luke in 'The Place Beyond the Pines'] He's the motorcycle equivalent of a boy band doing some low-level carnival circuit. He's kind of a melting pot of every masculine cliche with his tattoos, muscles and guns.
      It feels like not that long ago that I was on a show called Young Hercules (1998) in which I had a fake tan and wore tight leather pants and fought imaginary monsters.
      I can't tell you how many times people go, "Are you Ryan?" Then they take the picture and realize, in that moment, that I'm not Ryan Reynolds.

Ryan Thomas Gosling (born November 12, 1980) is a Canadian actor, director, writer and musician.[1] He began his career as a child star on the Disney Channel's Mickey Mouse Club (1993–95) and went on to appear in other family entertainment programs including Are You Afraid of the Dark? (1995), Goosebumps (1996), Breaker High (1997–98) and Young Hercules (1998–99). His first starring role was as a Jewish neo-Nazi in The Believer (2001), and he then built a reputation for playing main roles in independent films such as Murder by Numbers (2002), The Slaughter Rule (2002), and The United States of Leland (2003).
Gosling came to the attention of a wider audience in 2004 with a leading role in the romantic drama The Notebook, for which he won four Teen Choice Awards and an MTV Movie Award. His performance as a drug-addicted teacher in Half Nelson (2006) was nominated for an Academy Award and his performance as a socially inept loner in Lars and the Real Girl (2007) was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. Also in 2007, he starred in the courtroom thriller Fracture. After a three-year acting hiatus, Gosling starred in Blue Valentine, earning him a second Golden Globe nomination. 2011 proved to be a landmark year for Gosling as he appeared in three mainstream films – the romantic comedy-drama Crazy, Stupid, Love, the political drama The Ides of March and the thriller Drive – and received two Golden Globe nominations. In 2013, he starred in the crime drama Gangster Squad, the generational drama The Place Beyond the Pines, and the violent revenge film Only God Forgives.
Gosling's band, Dead Man's Bones, released their self-titled debut album and toured North America in 2009. He is a co-owner of Tagine, a Moroccan restaurant in Beverly Hills, California. He is a supporter of PETA, Invisible Children and the Enough Project and has travelled to Chad, Uganda and eastern Congo to raise awareness about conflicts in the regions.
Ryan Thomas Gosling was born in London, Ontario[2] to Thomas Ray Gosling, a traveling salesman for a paper mill,[3] and Donna, a secretary who qualified as a high school teacher in 2011.[4][5] His father is part of French Canadian descent.[6][7] Gosling's parents were Mormons,[8] and Gosling has said that the religion influenced every aspect of their lives.[9] Because of his father's work, they "moved around a lot"[3] and Gosling lived in both Cornwall, Ontario,[10] and Burlington, Ontario.[11] His parents divorced when he was a child, and he and his older sister Mandi lived with their mother,[4] an experience Gosling has credited with programming him "to think like a girl".[12]
Gosling was educated at Gladstone Public School,[13] Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School and Lester B. Pearson High School.[14] As a child, he watched Dick Tracy and was inspired to become an actor.[15] He "hated" being a child,[9][16] was bullied in elementary school[17] and had no friends until he was "14 or 15".[18][19] In the first grade, having been heavily influenced by the action film First Blood, he took steak knives to school and threw them at other children during recess. This incident led to a suspension.[16] He was unable to read[20] and was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), prescribed Ritalin, and placed in a class for special-needs students.[21] Consequently, his mother quit her job and homeschooled him for a year.[21] Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him "a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost".[9] Gosling performed from an early age. He and his sister sang together at weddings; he performed with Elvis Perry, his uncle's Elvis Presley tribute act,[22] and was involved with a local ballet company.[23] Performing boosted his self-confidence as it was the only thing he received praise for.[19] He developed an idiosyncratic accent because, as a child, he thought having a Canadian accent didn't sound "tough". He began to model his accent on that of Marlon Brando.[24] He dropped out of high school at the age of seventeen to focus on his acting career.[25]
In 1993, at the age of twelve, Gosling attended an open audition in Montreal for a revival of Disney Channel's Mickey Mouse Club.[26] He was given a two-year contract as a mouseketeer and moved to Orlando, Florida.[25] He appeared on-screen infrequently because other children were considered more talented.[27] Nonetheless, he has described the job as the greatest two years of his life.[25] Fellow cast members included Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera and Gosling has credited the experience with instilling in them "this great sense of focus."[28] He became particularly close friends with Timberlake and they lived together for six months during the second year of the show. Timberlake's mother became Gosling's legal guardian after his mother returned to Canada for work reasons.[29] Gosling has said that, even though he and Timberlake are no longer in touch, they are still supportive of each other.[28] Following the show's cancellation in 1995, Gosling returned to Canada and continued to appear in family entertainment television series including Are You Afraid of the Dark? (1995),[30] Goosebumps (1996)[31] and starred in Breaker High (1997–98).[32] At the age of eighteen, he moved to New Zealand to film the Fox Kids adventure series Young Hercules (1998–99).[33] While he initially enjoyed working on the series, he began to long for an opportunity to play a variety of characters and decided not to accept any more television work.[25]
At the age of nineteen, Gosling decided to move into "serious acting". He was dropped by his agent and initially found it difficult to secure work because of the "stigma" attached to children's television.[34] After a supporting role in the football drama Remember the Titans, Gosling secured a lead role as a young Jewish neo-Nazi in 2001's The Believer. Director Henry Bean said he cast Gosling because his Mormon upbringing helped him understand the isolation of Judaism.[35] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times praised an "electrifying and terrifyingly convincing" performance[36] while Todd McCarthy of Variety felt his "dynamite performance" could "scarcely have been better".[37] The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival[38] and Gosling has described it as "the film that kind of gift-wrapped for me the career that I have now."[22] Because of the controversial nature of the film, it was difficult to secure financial backing for a full theatrical release[39] and the film was instead broadcast on Showtime.[39] The film was a commercial failure, grossing just $416,925 worldwide from a production budget of $1.5 million.[40]
In 2002, Gosling co-starred in the psychological thriller Murder by Numbers with Sandra Bullock and Michael Pitt,[41] where Gosling and Pitt portrayed a pair of high school seniors who believe they can commit the perfect murder. Bullock played the detective tasked with investigating the crime. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly described him as "a phenomenal talent even in junk like this"[42] while Todd McCarthy of Variety felt that the "strong and "charismatic" young actors were "let down by the screenplay".[43] The film was a minor commercial success, grossing $56 million worldwide from a production budget of $50 million.[44] His second screen appearance of 2002 was in The Slaughter Rule with David Morse which explores the relationship between a high school football player and his troubled coach in rural Montana. Gosling has said that the opportunity to work with Morse made him "a better actor".[45] Stephen Holden of The New York Times described Gosling as "major star material" with a "rawness and an intensity that recall the young Matt Dillon"[46] while Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times was won over by his "raw talent".[47] The film was released in just three U.S. theaters and grossed $13,411.[48] In 2003, Gosling starred in The United States of Leland as a teenager imprisoned for the murder of a disabled boy. He was drawn to the role because it was unusual to find a character that was "emotionally disconnected for the whole film."[49] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt that the "gifted actor does everything that can be done with Leland, but the character comes from a writer's conceits, not from life."[50] A.O. Scott of The New York Times noted that he "struggles to rescue Leland from the clutches of cliché"[51] while David Rooney of Variety felt that his "one-note, blankly disturbed act has none of the magnetic edge of his breakthrough work in The Believer".[52] The film grossed $343,847 in the United States and was not released overseas.[53]
Gosling came to the attention of a mainstream audience in 2004 after starring opposite fellow Canadian Rachel McAdams in the romantic drama film The Notebook, a film adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel of the same name, directed by Nick Cassavetes.[54] Gosling portrayed Noah Calhoun and commented on the role: "It gave me an opportunity to play a character over a period of time – from 1940 to 1946 – that was quite profound and formative."[55] Gosling sought to imbue his character with "quiet strength" and was inspired by the performance of Sam Shepard in Days of Heaven. Shepard co-starred in The Notebook.[56] Filming took place in Charleston, South Carolina, in late 2002 and early 2003.[57] Although Gosling and McAdams became romantically involved in 2005, they had a combative relationship on the set.[58][59] "We inspired the worst in each other," Gosling has said. "It was a strange experience, making a love story and not getting along with your co-star in any way."[9] At one point, Gosling asked Cassavetes to "bring somebody else in for my off-camera shot" because he felt McAdams was uncooperative.[59] The New York Times praised the "spontaneous and combustible" performances of the two leads and noted that, "against your better judgment, you root for the pair to beat the odds against them."[60] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post praised Gosling's "beguiling unaffectedness" and noted that "it's hard not to like these two or begrudge them a great love together".[61] The film grossed over $115 million worldwide and, with adjustments for inflation, it remains the most commercially successful film of Gosling's career as of 2012.[62] Gosling won four Teen Choice Awards[63] and an MTV Movie Award.[64] Entertainment Weekly has said that the movie contains the All-Time Best Movie Kiss[65] while the Los Angeles Times has included a scene from the film in a list of the 50 Classic Movie Kisses.[66] The Notebook has appeared on many Most Romantic Movies lists.[67][68][69][70]
In 2005, Gosling appeared as a disturbed young art student in Stay, a psychological thriller film co-starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. In an uncomplimentary review of the film, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that Gosling "like his fans, deserves better."[71] Todd McCarthy of Variety felt that the "capable" McGregor and Gosling "deliver nothing new from what they've shown before".[72] The film grossed $8 million worldwide.[73] Gosling was unfazed by the negative reaction: "I had a kid come up to me on the street, 10 years old, and he says, 'Are you that guy from Stay? What the f--- was that movie about?' I think that's great. I'm just as proud if someone says, 'Hey, you made me sick in that movie,' as if they say I made them cry.”[74] Gosling next starred in 2006's Half Nelson as a drug-addicted junior high school teacher who forms a bond with a young student. To prepare for the role, Gosling moved to New York for one month before shooting began. He lived in a small apartment in Brooklyn and spent time shadowing an eighth grade teacher.[75] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described "a mesmerizing performance ... that shows the kind of deep understanding of character few actors manage."[76] Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle drew comparisons with Marlon Brando and declared that "nobody who cares about great acting will want to miss his performance".[77] Roger Ebert felt the performance "proves he's one of the finest actors working in contemporary movies."[78] He was nominated for an Academy Award.[20] The film grossed $4 million at the worldwide box office.[79] In 2007, he was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[80]
Gosling played an introvert who falls in love with a sex doll in the gently comedic 2007 film Lars and the Real Girl. He drew inspiration from James Stewart's performance in Harvey.[81] Roger Ebert felt "a film about a life-sized love doll" had been turned into "a life-affirming statement of hope" because of "a performance by Ryan Gosling that says things that cannot be said".[82] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post described his performance as "a small miracle ... because he changes and grows so imperceptibly before our eyes."[83] However, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt "the performance is a rare miscalculation in a mostly brilliant career."[84] He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.[85] The film was a box office failure, failing to recoup its $12 million production budget.[86] Gosling starred opposite Anthony Hopkins in the 2007 courtroom thriller Fracture. He originally turned down the role, but changed his mind when Hopkins signed on.[87] He spent time shadowing lawyers and observing courtroom proceedings in preparation for the role.[88] Claudia Puig of USA Today declared that "watching a veteran like Hopkins verbally joust with one of the best young actors in Hollywood is worth the price of admission".[89] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt it was a treat to watch "the spectacle of that crafty scene stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen nibbler Ryan Gosling ... Each actor is playing a pulp type rather than a fully formed individual, but both fill in the blanks with an alchemical mix of professional and personal charisma."[90] The film grossed over $91 million worldwide.[91]
Gosling was scheduled to begin filming The Lovely Bones in 2007. However, he left the production two days before filming began because of "creative differences" and was replaced by Mark Wahlberg.[92] Gosling had been cast as the father of the murdered teenage girl and initially felt he was too young for the role. The director Peter Jackson and the producer Fran Walsh persuaded him that he could be aged with hair and make-up changes.[93] Before shooting began, Gosling gained 60 pounds in weight and grew a beard in order to appear older.[93] Walsh then "began to feel he was not right. It was our blindness, the desire to make it work no matter what."[93] Gosling later said, "We didn't talk very much during the preproduction process, which was the problem ... I just showed up on set, and I had gotten it wrong. Then I was fat and unemployed."[93] He has said the experience was "an important realisation for me: not to let your ego get involved. It's OK to be too young for a role."[94]
Following a three-year absence from the big screen, Gosling starred in five movies in 2010 and 2011. "I’ve never had more energy,” Gosling has said. “I’m more excited to make films than I used to be. I used to kind of dread it. It was so emotional and taxing. But I’ve found a way to have fun while doing it. And I think that translates into the films.”[34] He has also spoken of feeling depressed when not working.[19] In 2010, he co-starred with Michelle Williams in Derek Cianfrance's directorial debut, the marital drama Blue Valentine. The low-budget film was mainly improvised and Gosling has said "you had to remind yourself you were making a film".[95] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt he "brings a preternatural understanding of people to his performance"[96] while A.O. Scott of The New York Times found him "convincing as the run-down, desperate, older Dean, and maybe a bit less so as the younger version".[97][97] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly noted that he "plays Dean as a snarky working-class hipster, but when his anger is unleashed, the performance turns powerful."[98] However, Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe felt the performance was an example of "hipsterism misdirected".[99] He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama.[100] The film was a box office success, grossing over $12 million worldwide from a production budget of $1 million.[101] Gosling's second on-screen appearance of 2010 was in the mystery film All Good Things with Kirsten Dunst, based on a true story. He played the role of New York real-estate heir Robert Durst, who was investigated for the disappearance of his wife (played by Dunst).[102] Gosling found the filming process to be a "dark experience" and did not undertake any promotional duties for the film.[103] When asked if he was proud of the film, he replied, "I'm proud of what Kirsten does in the movie."[103] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone felt he "gets so deep into character you can feel his nerve endings."[104] Mick La Salle of the San Francisco Chronicle found the "chameleonic Gosling is completely convincing as this empty shell of a man".[105] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt that the film belonged to Dunst, but noted that Gosling "is good too".[106] The film grossed $644,535 worldwide.[107] Also in 2010, Gosling narrated and produced ReGeneration, a documentary that explores the cynicism in today’s youth towards social and political causes.[108][109]
2011 saw Gosling expand his horizons by appearing in three diverse, high-profile roles. He co-starred in his first comedic role in the romantic comedy-drama Crazy, Stupid, Love, with Steve Carell and Emma Stone.[110] Gosling took cocktail-making classes at a Los Angeles bar in preparation for his role as a smooth-talking ladies' man.[111] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post said his "seductive command presence suggests we may have found our next George Clooney".[112] Peter Travers declared him "a comic knockout"[113] while Claudia Puig of USA Today felt he reveals a "surprising" "knack for comedy."[114] He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.[115] The film was a box office success, grossing over $142 million worldwide.[116] With adjustments for inflation, it is the second most successful of Gosling's career.[62] Gosling's first action role was in Drive, based on a novel by James Sallis.[117] Gosling portrayed a Hollywood stunt performer who moonlights as a getaway driver and he has described the film as a "violent John Hughes movie": "I always thought if Pretty in Pink had head-smashing it would be perfect".[118] Roger Ebert compared Gosling to Steve McQueen and stated that he "embodies presence and sincerity ... he has shown a gift for finding arresting, powerful characters [and] can achieve just about anything.[119] Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal pondered "the ongoing mystery of how he manages to have so much impact with so little apparent effort. It's irresistible to liken his economical style to that of Marlon Brando."[120] The film was a box office success, grossing $70 million worldwide from a production budget of $15 million.[121] In his final appearance of 2011, Gosling co-starred with Philip Seymour Hoffman in the political drama The Ides of March directed by George Clooney, in which he played an ambitious press secretary.[122] Gosling partly decided to do the film to become more politically aware: "I'm Canadian and so American politics aren't really in my wheelhouse."[123] Joe Morganstern of the Wall Street Journal said that Gosling and Hoffman "are eminently well equipped to play variations on their characters' main themes. Yet neither actor has great material to conjure with in the script."[124] In a generally tepid review, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times asserted that it was "certainly involving to see the charismatic Gosling verbally spar with superb character actors like Hoffman and [Paul] Giamatti."[125] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt there was "one aspect to the character that Gosling can't quite nail down, that might simply be outside his sphere, which is idealism."[126] He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama.[115] The film grossed $66 million worldwide.[127]
In 2013's Gangster Squad, a crime drama film, Gosling portrayed Sgt. Jerry Wooters, a 1940s LAPD officer who attempts to outsmart mob boss Mickey Cohen (played by Sean Penn). He was reunited with Emma Stone as his love interest, after their earlier pairing in Crazy, Stupid Love. Stone has said she hopes they will find more projects to work together on.[128] A.O. Scott of The New York Times described the film as an excuse for the cast "to earn some money trying out funny voices and suppressing whatever sense of nuance they might possess."[129] Christy Lemire of the Boston Globe criticized Gosling's "weird, whispery voice" and his "barely developed, one-note" character.[130] However, Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt that there was a "a seductive power" in the scenes shared by Gosling and Stone: "But like too much else in the film, it's a scenario that is only half played out."[131] In The Place Beyond the Pines, a generational drama directed by Blue Valentine's Derek Cianfrance,[132] Gosling portrayed Luke, a motorcycle stunt rider who robs banks in order to provide for his family.[133] The shoot was described by Gosling as "the best experience I have ever had making a film."[23] Scott Foundas of The Village Voice was unimpressed: "Gosling's character verges on parody ... Gosling uses a soft, wounded half-whisper that tells us this is all some kind of put-on ... It's a close variation on the role Gosling played to stronger effect in Nicolas Winding Refn's existential Hollywood thriller, Drive, where it was clear the character was meant to be an abstraction."[134] A. O. Scott of the New York Times praised the performance: "Mr. Gosling’s cool self-possession — the only thing he was allowed to display in “Drive” — is complicated, made interesting, by hints of childlike innocence and vulnerability."[135] David Denby of The New Yorker remarked that he "reprises his inexorable-loner routine".[136] The film has grossed $35 million worldwide from a production budget of $15 million.[137]
Later that year, Gosling starred in the violent revenge drama Only God Forgives,[138] directed by Drive's Nicolas Winding Refn. Gosling undertook Muay Thai training in preparation for the role[139] and has described the script as "the strangest thing I’ve ever read".[139] David Edelstein of New York Magazine stated: "Gosling looked like a major actor as a skinhead in The Believer and a star in Half Nelson. Then he stopped acting and started posing. His performance in Only God Forgives (would God forgive that title?) is one long, moist stare".[140] Peter Debruge of Variety remarked that "the wallpaper emotes more than Ryan Gosling."[141] Stephen Holden of the New York Times criticised Gosling's inability "to give his automaton any suggestion of an inner life".[142] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone commented that Gosling, while "meant to be a blank page for us to write on, often looks merely blank".[143] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times was disappointed by Gosling's performance: "Gosling moves through "Only God Forgives" like a mannequin waiting to be brought to life ... has never been less dimensional".[144] Sara Stewart of the New York Post was unimpressed: "Gosling reprises his man-of-few-words persona ... Enough already."[145]
Gosling's directorial debut Lost River competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.[146] The "fantasy noir", written by Gosling, stars Christina Hendricks, Ben Mendelsohn, and Matt Smith.[147][148] The film received largely unfavourable reviews.[149] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found it "insufferably conceited" and remarked that Gosling had lost "any sense of proportion or humility."[150] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph described Lost River as "mind-bogglingly pleased with itself"[151] while Variety's Justin Chang dismissed the "derivative" film as a "train-wreck."[152] Gosling has filmed an appearance in an as-yet-untitled film by Terrence Malick.[153] The film's co-stars Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Haley Bennett, Val Kilmer and Michael Fassbender.[154] When asked to provide details of the film or his role, Gosling replied, "I can't comment. A 'Chatty Cathy' that one."[155] Gosling had previously signed up to work with Malick in 2004 on the biographical film Che.[156] However, Malick left the project to direct The New World and Gosling later dropped out with scheduling conflicts.[157]
In early 2013, Gosling announced that he was taking a break from acting, stating,“I’ve lost perspective on what I’m doing. I think it’s good for me to take a break and reassess why I’m doing it and how I’m doing it. And I think this is probably a good way to learn about that.”[158]
In 2007, Gosling made a solo recording called "Put Me in the Car" available for download on the Internet.[159] Also that year, Gosling and his friend Zach Shields formed the indie rock band Dead Man's Bones. The two first met in 2005 when Gosling was dating Rachel McAdams and Shields was dating her sister, Kayleen.[160][161] They initially conceived of the project as a monster-themed musical but settled on forming a band when they realized putting on a stage production would be too expensive.[160] They recorded their self-titled debut album with the Silverlake Conservatory's Children's Choir and learned to play all the instruments themselves.[160] Gosling contributed vocals, piano, guitar, bass guitar and cello to the record.[161] The album was released through ANTI- Records on October 6, 2009.[162] Pitchfork Media was won over by the "unique, catchy and lovably weird record"[163] while Prefix felt the album was "rarely kitschy and never inappropriate".[164] However, Spin felt the album "doesn't reverse the rule that actors make dubious pop musicians"[165] and Entertainment Weekly criticized its "cloying, gothic preciousness".[166]
In September 2009, Gosling and Shields had a three-night residency at LA's Bob Baker Marionette Theater where they performed alongside dancing neon skeletons and glowing ghosts.[161][167] They then conducted a thirteen-date tour of North America in October 2009, using a local children's choir at every show.[168][169] Instead of an opening act, a talent show was held each night.[170] In September 2010, they performed at Los Angeles' FYF Festival. In 2011, the actor spoke of his intentions to record a second Dead Man's Bones album. No children's choir will be featured on the follow-up album because "it's not very rock 'n' roll".[171]
Gosling is supportive of various social causes. He has worked with PETA on a campaign to encourage KFC and McDonald's to use improved methods of chicken slaughter in their factories, and on a campaign encouraging dairy farmers to stop de-horning cows.[172][173][174] Gosling volunteered in Biloxi, Mississippi in 2005, as part of the clean-up effort following Hurricane Katrina.[175] He is a supporter of Invisible Children Inc, a group that raises awareness about the LRA in Central Africa.[176] In 2005, Gosling travelled to Darfur refugee camps in Chad.[20][177] He was a speaker at Campus Progress's National Conference in 2008 where he discussed Darfur.[178] As part of his work with the Enough Project, he visited Uganda in 2007[179] and eastern Congo in 2010.[180]
Gosling resides in New York City with his mixed-breed dog, George.[15][181] He co-owns Tagine, a Moroccan restaurant in Beverly Hills, California.[182] He bought the restaurant on an impulse and said he spent "all [his] money" on it[183] and spent a year doing the renovation work himself and now oversees the restaurant's menus.[183][184]
Gosling dated his Murder by Numbers co-star Sandra Bullock for a year from 2002 to 2003.[185] Gosling dated his The Notebook co-star Rachel McAdams from mid-2005 to mid-2007.[186][187] They also briefly reunited in mid-2008.[188][189][190][191][192][193][194] Gosling began dating American actress and model Eva Mendes in September 2011.[195]

1993Mouseketeering With Future Pop StarsAspiring Canadian actor Ryan Gosling auditions at an open call in Montreal for the revival of Disney's The Mickey Mouse Club. He wins a two-year spot, moves to Orlando, and dances backup for Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake (left). "Christina had the same voice then as she does now. Nothing I was doing was on that level," he recalls to Entertainment Weekly. "But I had the greatest two years ever. I walked around...riding Space Mountain and puking my brains out. It was awesome." When the show is cancelled, he returns home to Ontario.1998Young HerculesAt 17, Gosling drops out of school and moves to L.A. He quickly lands an agent and the title role of the short-lived Fox series Young Hercules (right). "Initially, I did the series because it was fun," he tells the Vancouver Sun in 2002. "But then I started to care too much about it, and it wasn't fun any more...I wanted to do films, have more time to sit with a character and to try to play different characters. So I just said, 'No more television.'"2001May 17Titans & The BelieverAfter making his feature debut with Denzel Washington and Hayden Panettiere in Disney's Remember the Titans, Gosling earns critical praise for portraying a Jewish neo-Nazi leader in The Believer (left). The film wins the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, yet is barely distributed in theaters because of its violent nature. "Things changed for me," he tells the New York Times. "I felt I had a place I could put the things I had inside of me into."2002April 19Numbers Between Gosling & BullockGosling scores a mild box office success – $32 million – starring as one half of the teen-prodigy, serial-killing duo in the psychological thriller Murder by Numbers. Sandra Bullock (right) plays the detective hot on his trail onscreen. Off screen, with 16 years between them, the costars date for over a year.2004June 25Gosling & McAdams' Love NoteGosling stars in the film adaptation of the Nicholas Spark's novel The Notebook with Rachel McAdams. The lost-and-found love story captivates audiences, making $115 million worldwide. Gosling's catapulted into hot, leading-man status. "I just think: he's 23, he might as well be 63 years old," the film's director Nick Cassavetes tells the New York Times. "He's like one of those freaks, he kind of gets it. He's honest, that's really what you want out of an actor."2005June 09Taking the Leading LadyGosling and The Notebook costar Rachel McAdams win the MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss. Their reenactment of the kiss on stage (right) solidifies their status as a real-life couple. They both shun Hollywood's spotlight and keep quiet about their relationship. However, McAdams does tells Elle: "He's very brave. I don't think he sees the point [in making a movie] unless he can find out what he's made of every time. He just doesn't back off." 2006August 11Oscar Nod for NelsonDespite achieving commercial success with The Notebook, Gosling opts to play a drug-addicted, junior high school teacher in the controversial drama Half Nelson. With only an estimated $1 million budget, the film earns rave reviews and a Best Actor Oscar nomination for the 26-year-old. While favorite Forest Whitaker takes home the award, Gosling wins the Film Independent Spirit Award and jokes, "Forest asked me to win for him tonight. He said he's exhausted." 2007April 20Watching Hopkins in FractureGosling stars opposite Anthony Hopkins in the murder thriller Fracture, which grosses $39 million at the box office.  He plays a L.A. district attorney whose career depends on convicting Hopkins for the perfect murder of his adulterous wife. "I'd have to remind myself, 'You have a character to play. Stop watching him,'" Gosling tells EW. "I was trying to take apart how Anthony does it, trying to dismantle his talent and understand it. And I never could." OctoberConfirming Ryan & Rachel's EndAfter months of "are they or aren't they," the usually quiet actor confirms the end of his two-year relationship with McAdams to GQ. Gosling talks about the public's reaction to the split ("A girl came up to me on the street and she almost smacked me"), but says little about the actual breakup: "The only thing I remember is we both went down swingin' and we called it a draw." October 12Acting Opposite a Sex DollGosling packs on the pounds and keeps the facial hair for Lars and the Real Girl, an oddball love story about one man's emotional relationship with a doll. "People will laugh when they hear the plot," Gosling tells the Denver Post. "But I want to go on record as saying it's even more romantic than The Notebook." Despite its critical praise at the Toronto Film Festival, the movie is released in limited theaters and earns less than a million dollars its opening weekend.

=======================================================
An actor, singer, guitarist, pianist, writer and director - Ryan Gosling has many strings to his bow, making him one of Hollywood's biggest names. What's more, he's known as being one of the good guys in life, but how did it all start?
He started off being known for his role in the romantic film 'The Notebook' and has gone on to become one of Hollywood's biggest stars. A great career for a man who was once taken out of school because of bullying by his fellow students.
Ryan Thomas Gosling was born on 12 November 1980 in London, Ontario to travelling salesman Thomas and secretary Donna Gosling. He is the second of their two children and has an older sister called Mandi. Due to his father's job, the family moved around a lot with Gosling living in Cornwall, Ontario and Burlington as a child.
His parents were Mormons, with Gosling stating this impacted every part of their lives. He also credits his parents' divorce and the fact he was brought up by his mother for making him think like a girl. Gosling was educated at Gladstone Public School, Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School and Lester B Pearson.
Gosling has stated he hated being a child as he was bullied from a young age. He has also revealed he had no friends until the age of 14 or 15. He also struggled with attention deficit disorder, for which he was prescribed Ritalin, and could not read. Due to his problems at school, his mother decided to teach him at home for a year. She qualified as a high school teacher in 2011.
It wasn't all doom and gloom though as Gosling found an outlet in performing. As a child, he sang at weddings with his sister, performed with his uncle's tribute act to Elvis Presley and was involved with his local ballet company.
His big break came in 1993 at the age of 13 when he attended an open audition in Montreal for a revival of Disney's 'Mickey Mouse Club'. He won a two-year contract and moved to Florida. Gosling was on the show at the same time as Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears. He even lived with Timberlake for six months while taking part in the show.
In 1995, Gosling retuned to Canada as the show was cancelled. He went on to appear in 'Are You Afraid of the Dark?' (1995), 'Goosebumps' (1996) and 'Breaker High' (1997-98). At the age of 17, he dropped out of high school to focus on his acting career.
At 18 years old, Gosling moved to New Zealand to film the children's show 'Young Hercules', which he enjoyed to start with. However, he wanted to play more characters and decided not to do any more television work.
He was dropped by his agent and initially found it hard to get work in films but in 2000, he was given a supporting role in 'Remember the Titans'. This was followed by his first lead role in 2001 in the controversial film 'The Believer'. In this movie, Gosling played a neo-Nazi who was also Jewish and was therefore conflicted in his beliefs. Despite showcasing Gosling's talents, the film was a financial failure.
In 2002, he played the role of a high school senior who believed he could commit the perfect murder with his friend in 'Murder by Numbers'. Sandra Bullock starred as the detective investigating the crime. The pair dated for a year afterwards. Despite the film only being a minor success, Gosling received high praise for his acting.
The same year, he appeared in 'The Slaughter Role' before taking on the role of a teenager in prison for murdering a disabled boy in 2003's 'The United States of Leland'. Gosling stated he was attracted to the role as it is unusual to find a character emotionally disconnected for the whole film.
Gosling then came to mainstream attention in one of the greatest romantic films ever made, 'The Notebook', which was released in 2004. He played the lead opposite Rachel McAdams, with whom he had a combative relationship on-set. However, in 2005 they started dating and remained together for two years. The film grossed $15 million, making it Gosling's most lucrative to date and he won four Teen Choice Awards as well as an MTV Movie Award.
In 2005, he played a disturbed art student in 'Stay' before taking on the role of a drug-addicted high school teacher who forms a bond with one of his students in 'Half Nelson' in 2006. He was compared to the likes of Marlon Brando and complimented for his acting skills. Gosling was also nominated for an Academy Award for this role.
This was followed by 'Lars and the Real Girl' in 2007, which saw Gosling play an introvert who falls in love with a sex doll. Despite the film failing to recoup its budget at the box office, Gosling was nominated for a Golden Globe. He starred alongside Antony Hopkins in 'Fracture' the same year.
Gosling then took a three-year absence from the big screen to concentrate on his second love – music. With his friend Zach Shields, Gosling set up the band Dead Man's Bones who play dark folk-rock. Gosling sings and plays the piano and guitar in the group. In 2009, they released their self-titled debut album before going on tour.
He returned to film in the independent drama 'Blue Valentine' with Michelle Williams in 2010. The movie jumps between how the couple met and their struggles with married life five years on. Large parts of the film were improvised and proved that Gosling can play troubled yet sympathetic characters. He was nominated for a Golden Globe once again.
The same year, he appeared in mystery crime thriller 'All Good Things' with Kirsten Dunst. He then narrated and produced a documentary about cynicism in today's youth when it comes to politics called 'ReGeneration'.
Gosling finally emerged as a Hollywood name to watch in 2011 when he starred in 'Crazy, Stupid Love' in his first comedic role. He was nominated for a Golden Globe and this became the second-highest grossing film of his career. This was followed by the gritty lead in 'Drive', in which the actor used his own driving skills to complete the stunts. It was also a success and led to positive praise for the actor.
This was followed by political drama 'Ides of March', which also starred and was directed by George Clooney. All of these roles made a name for the young star.
'The Place Beyond the Pines' was next -it was while filming this movie that Gosling met his current girlfriend Eva Mendes.
He also appeared in 'The Gangster Squad' and 'Only God Forgives' and has shot scenes for an as yet-untitled film directed by Terrence Malick. In 2014 he made his directorial debut in 2014 - he filmed and wrote 'Lost River' which received generally negative reviews.
Right, so: now that we’ve convinced you Lifetime is a thing you need to have in your life – what now? How do you get this on your telly? Here’s what you have to do.
=======================================================
Born to a Mormon family in London, Ontario, Ryan Gosling was raised in Cornwall. Always eager to please, he started performing early, singing and dancing at talent shows and weddings with his older sister. When he turned 12, Gosling sought out a wider audience, auditioning and beating over 17,000 hopefuls to be a part of The Mickey Mouse Club.
After two years on the show, Gosling made appearances in a number of series including Road to Avonlea, Ready or Not, Goosebumps, Flash Forward, Psi Factor, and Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.
Following his first role in a feature film, Frankenstein and Me (1996), he landed a regular gig in the series Breaker High playing Sean Hanlon. The short-lived series forced Gosling to look for work and he earned parts in telefilms, Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy and The Unbelievables and the title role in the New Zealand-filmed series, Young Hercules.
The start of the 21st century splash-landed Gosling into a sea of lead roles in the motion picture industry. After playing a football player in Remember The Titans (2000), he impressed critics with his portrayal of Danny Balint, a Jewish boy turned Nazi, in The Believer (2001) (the latter of which earned him an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Male Lead). He continued to impress viewers with his convincing turn as playboy
rich-kid-turned-murderer in Murder By Numbers (2002), opposite Sandra Bullock, whom he dated for a while after shooting was finished. Next, he took on the title role of Leland Fitzgerald in The United States of Leland (2004), playing a teen who commits a seemingly senseless murder. Gosling received a 2004 ShoWest Award as Male Star of Tomorrow. In 2005 he shared an MTV Movie Award with his The Notebook (2004) co-star, Rachel McAdams, for Best Kiss. They also shared Teen Choice Awards for Choice Movie Chemistry, Choice Movie Love Scene and Choice Movie Liplock. He also received Choice Movie Actor: Drama and Choice Movie Breakout Performance - Male for the film.
In 2007 he received an Oscar nomination for his work in Half Nelson (2006), in which he played a drug addicted junior high school teacher. In 2011, he was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance in Blue Valentine followed by two more in 2011 for The Ides of March and Crazy, Stupid, Love. Following the success of these projects, Gosling topped it off with two more notable roles, the first as a 1940s cop taking on the East Coast Mafia in Gangster Squad (2013) and the second as a motorcycle stunt rider in The Place Beyond the Pines (2013). He will next be seen in the French-Danish thriller  Only God Forgives (2013). 
When relaxing, Gosling enjoys playing music, specifically jazz on guitar and piano, reading, and horseback riding. He is currently dating his The Place Beyond the Pines co-star Eva Mendes—the pair first got together in September 2011.

Leave Justin Bieber Alone: America's Problem with Male Child StarsFeb 13, 2014 09:18 PM ETby Sadie GennisThe media narrative surrounding Justin Bieber has spiraled out of control. He's this year's Anne Hathaway, the person whom it's vogue to hate. But this turn isn't completely unfounded. Over the past few years, Bieber has undoubtedly become a bit of a jerk.
He was charged for illegal (and seemingly racist) graffiti, pissed in a mop bucket, left his monkey in Germany and could anyone seriously forget this hat? But for non-Beliebers, there has always been something grating about the singer. Everything from his swoopy hair to his sugar-pop love songs seemed designed to annoy all post-pubescents on sight, breeding discontent which lay dormant until his penchant for leather sweatpants and hocking loogies made him impossible to ignore.

A couple of weeks ago we told ya about some major buzz in Hollywood over who would take on the cape of the Caped Crusader when he faces off against Superman in the Man of Steel sequel. Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling and Joe Mangianello were rumored to be Dark Knight front-runners, but turns out, the newest Batman will be better than we could've ever imagined! Mr. two-time Oscar winner, sexy husband and dad of three, Ben Affleck.
