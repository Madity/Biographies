=======================================================
Catherine "Kate" Bush, CBE (born 30 July 1958)[1] is an English singer-songwriter, musician and record producer. Her eclectic musical style and idiosyncratic vocal style have made her one of the United Kingdom's most successful solo female performers of the past 35 years.
In 1978, at the age of 19, Bush topped the UK Singles Chart for four weeks with her debut single "Wuthering Heights", becoming the first woman to have a UK number one with a self-written song.[2] She has since released ten albums, three of which topped the UK Albums Chart. She has had 25 UK Top 40 hit singles, including the Top 10 hits "Wuthering Heights", "The Man with the Child in His Eyes", "Babooshka", "Running Up that Hill", "Don't Give Up" (a duet with Peter Gabriel) and "King of the Mountain".
In 1987, she won a Brit Award for Best British Female Solo Artist, and in 2002, her song writing ability was recognised with an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. During the course of her career, she has also been nominated for three Grammy Awards. After her 1979 tour – the only concert tour of her career before 2014 – Bush released the 1980 album Never for Ever, which made her the first British solo female artist to top the UK album charts and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at Number 1.[3] She is also the first (and to date only) female artist to have Top 5 albums in the UK charts in five successive decades.
Bush was appointed Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to music.[4][5] She received the award from Queen Elizabeth II on 10 April 2013 at Windsor Castle.[6]
Bush was born in Welling, Kent (now London), to English medical doctor Robert Bush and his Irish wife, Hannah Daly.[7] She was raised as a Roman Catholic[8] in their farmhouse in East Wickham with her older brothers, John and Paddy.[9] Bush came from an artistic background: her mother was a former Irish folk dancer, her father was an accomplished pianist, Paddy worked as a musical instrument maker and John was a poet and photographer. Both brothers were involved in the local folk music scene.[10]
John was a karateka at Goldsmiths College karate club and Kate also trained there, becoming known as "Ee-ee" because of her squeaky kiai. One of the instructors, Dave Hazard, later noted in his autobiography that her dance moves seemed to owe something to karate.[11]
Her family's musical influence inspired the young Kate to teach herself to play the piano at the age of 11. She also played the organ in a barn behind her parents' house and studied the violin.[12] She soon began writing her own tunes and eventually added lyrics to them.[13]
Bush attended St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls' school (later part of St Mary's and St Joseph's School, Sidcup), in Woolwich Road, Abbey Wood, South East London, in the mid-1970s. During this time her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which was turned down by record labels. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded that would be more saleable to the record companies.[14] Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour.[15] The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums,[13] and sound engineer Geoff Emerick.[16] The tape was sent to EMI executive Terry Slater.[17] Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her.[18] The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation.[17] Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts.[17]
Bush was put on retainer for two years by Bob Mercer, managing director of EMI group-repertoire division. According to Mercer he felt Bush's material was good enough to be released but felt that if the album failed it would be demoralising and if it was successful Bush was too young to handle it.[19] For the first two years of her contract, Bush spent more time on school work than making an album. She left school after doing her mock A-levels and having gained ten GCE O-Level qualifications.[20] In 2005, Bush stated in an interview with Mark Radcliffe on BBC Radio 2 that she believed EMI signed her before she was ready to make an album so that no other record company could offer her a contract. After the contract signing, EMI forwarded her a sizeable advance which she used to enroll in interpretive dance classes taught by Lindsay Kemp, a former teacher of David Bowie,[21] and mime training with Adam Darius.[22]
Bush also wrote and made demos of close to 200 songs, a few of which today can be found on bootleg recordings and are known as the Phoenix Recordings.[23] From March to August 1977, she fronted the KT Bush Band at public houses around London – specifically at the Rose of Lee public house (now Dirty South) in Lewisham. The other three band members were Del Palmer (bass), Brian Bath (guitar), and Vic King (drums). She began recording her first album in August 1977,[13] although two tracks had been recorded during the summer of 1975.
As part of her preparation for entering the studio, Bush toured pubs with the KT Bush Band. However, for her début album The Kick Inside (1978) she was persuaded to use established session musicians, some of whom she would retain even after she had brought her bandmates back on board.[24] Her brother Paddy played the harmonica and mandolin, unlike on later albums where he would play more exotic instruments such as the balalaika and didgeridoo. Stuart Elliott played some of the drums and would become her main drummer on subsequent albums.[25]
Bush released The Kick Inside when she was 19 years old, but some of the songs had been written when she was as young as 13. EMI originally wanted the more rock-oriented track "James and the Cold Gun" to be her début single, but Bush insisted that it should be "Wuthering Heights". Even at this early stage of her career, she had gained a reputation for her determination to have a say in decisions affecting her work.[13] "Wuthering Heights" topped the UK and Australian charts and became an international hit.[26] Bush became the first woman to reach number one in the UK charts with a self-penned song.[27] A second single, "The Man with the Child in His Eyes", reached number six in the UK charts.[28] It also made it onto the American Billboard Hot 100 where it reached number 85 in early 1979. Bob Mercer felt that Bush's relative lack of success in the United States compared to the rest of the world was due to her music being a poor fit for American radio formats and that there were no outlets for the visual presentation central to Bush's appeal.[19] "The Man with the Child in His Eyes" went on to win her an Ivor Novello Award in 1979 for Outstanding British Lyric.[29]
EMI capitalised on Bush's appearance by promoting the album with a poster of her in a tight pink top that emphasised her breasts. In an interview with NME magazine in 1982, Bush criticised the marketing technique, stating: "People weren't even generally aware that I wrote my own songs or played the piano. The media just promoted me as a female body. It's like I've had to prove that I'm an artist in a female body."[13] In late 1978, EMI persuaded Bush to quickly record a follow-up album, Lionheart, to take advantage of the success of The Kick Inside. Bush has often expressed dissatisfaction with Lionheart, feeling that she had needed more time to get it right. The album was produced by Andrew Powell, assisted by Bush. While it had spawned several hit singles, most notably "Wow", it did not garner the same reception as her first album, reaching number six in the UK album charts.[30]
Bush was displeased with being rushed into making the second album. She set up her own publishing company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, Novercia, to maintain complete control over her work. Members of her family, along with Bush herself, composed the company's board of directors.[13] Following the album's release, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour, the only one of her career.[31] The tour, named The Tour of Life, began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. This live show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake.[32] Typical of her determination to have control, she was involved in every aspect of the production, choreography, set design and staff recruitment for the show.[13] The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her intention to dance as she sang, her sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a radio microphone to fashion the first headset microphone to be used by a rock performer since the Swedish group Spotnicks used a very primitive version in the early 1960s.[1][33]
Released in September 1980, Never for Ever saw Bush's second foray into production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. Her first time as a producer was on her Live on Stage EP, released after her tour the previous year. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on Never for Ever is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker "Violin" to the wistful waltz of hit single "Army Dreamers".
"Artists shouldn't be made famous. They have this huge aura of almost god-like quality about them, just because their craft makes a lot of money. And at the same time it is a forced importance...It is man-made so the press can feed off it."
Never for Ever was the first Kate Bush album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI, to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel's eponymous third album in early 1980.[13] It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status,[20] and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the top.[3] The top-selling single from the album was "Babooshka", which reached number five in the UK singles chart.[35] In November 1980, she released the standalone Christmas single "December Will Be Magic Again", which reached number 29 in the UK charts.
September 1982 saw the release of The Dreaming, the first album Bush produced by herself.[36] With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. The Dreaming received a mixed critical reception in the UK, and many were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become "less accessible".[37] In a 1993 interview with Q, Bush stated: "That was my 'She's gone mad' album."[13] However, the album became her first to enter the US Billboard 200 chart, albeit only reaching number 157.[13] The album entered the UK album chart at number three, but is to date her lowest-selling album, garnering only a silver disc.
"Sat in Your Lap" was the first single from the album to be released. It pre-dated the album by over a year and peaked at number 11 in the UK.[38] The album's title track, featuring the talents of Rolf Harris and Percy Edwards, stalled at number 48, while the third single, "There Goes a Tenner", failed to chart, despite promotion from EMI and Bush. The track "Suspended in Gaffa" was released as a single in Europe, but not in the UK.
Continuing in her storytelling tradition, Bush looked far outside her own personal experience for sources of inspiration. She drew on old crime films for "There Goes a Tenner", a documentary about the war in Vietnam for "Pull Out the Pin", and the plight of Indigenous Australians for "The Dreaming". "Houdini" is about the magician's death, and "Get Out of My House" was inspired by Stephen King's novel The Shining.[39]
Hounds of Love was released in 1985. Because of the high cost of hiring studio space for her previous album, she built a private studio near her home, where she could work at her own pace.[40] Hounds of Love ultimately topped the charts in the UK, knocking Madonna's Like a Virgin from the number one position.[41]
The album takes advantage of the vinyl and cassette formats with two very different sides. The first side, Hounds of Love, contains five "accessible" pop songs, including the four singles "Running Up that Hill", "Cloudbusting", "Hounds of Love", and "The Big Sky". "Running Up that Hill" reached number 3 in the UK charts and also re-introduced Bush to American listeners, climbing to number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1985. The second side of the album, The Ninth Wave, takes its name from Tennyson's poem, "Idylls of the King", about the legendary King Arthur's reign, and is seven interconnecting songs joined in one continuous piece of music.[42]
The album earned Bush nominations for Best Female Solo Artist, Best Album, Best Single, and Best Producer at the 1986 BRIT Awards. In the same year, Bush and Peter Gabriel had a UK top ten hit with the duet "Don't Give Up" (Dolly Parton, Gabriel's original choice to sing the female vocal, turned his offer down),[43] and EMI released her "greatest hits" album, The Whole Story. Bush provided a new lead vocal and refreshed backing track on "Wuthering Heights," and recorded a new single, "Experiment IV," for inclusion on the compilation. At the 1987 BRIT Awards, Bush won the award for Best Female Solo Artist.
The increasingly personal tone of her writing continued on 1989's The Sensual World. One of the quirkiest tracks on the album, touched by Bush's black humour, is "Heads We're Dancing", about a woman who dances all night with a charming stranger only to discover in the morning that he is Adolf Hitler.[44] The title track drew its inspiration from James Joyce's novel Ulysses.[44]
The Sensual World went on to become her biggest-selling album in the US, receiving an RIAA Gold certification four years after its release for 500,000 copies sold. In the United Kingdom album charts, it reached the number two position.[45]
"I don't think of myself as a musician. As a writer, I suppose. I only ever play the piano to accompany myself singing. I could never sit and read a piece of music. At best, I'm an accompanist. I suppose the worst thing is frustration at your own ability. Not being able to do what you want to do."
In 1990, the boxed-set This Woman's Work was released and included all of her albums with their original cover art, as well as two discs of all single B sides recorded from 1978 to 1990. In 1991, Bush released a cover of Elton John's "Rocket Man", which reached number 12 in the UK singles chart,[48] and went as high as number two in Australia, and in 2007, was voted the greatest cover ever by readers of The Observer newspaper.[49] She recorded "Candle in the Wind", as the single's b-side.[50]
Bush's seventh studio album, The Red Shoes, was released in November 1993. The album features more high-profile cameo appearances than her previous efforts, including contributions from composer and conductor Michael Kamen, comedy actor Lenny Henry, Prince, Eric Clapton, Gary Brooker of Procol Harum, Trevor Whittaker, and Jeff Beck. Both The Sensual World and The Red Shoes featured contributions from Trio Bulgarka, the Bulgarian female vocal trio who sang on several tracks including "You're The One" and "Rocket's Tail". The album gave Bush her highest chart position in the US, reaching number 28, although the only song from the album to make the US singles chart was "Rubberband Girl", which peaked at number 88 in January 1994. In the UK, the album reached number two, and the singles "Rubberband Girl", "The Red Shoes", "Moments of Pleasure", and "And So Is Love" all reached the top 30.[38][51] In 1994, Bush released an accompanying short film, The Line, the Cross & the Curve. Written, directed by, and starring Bush, along with English actress Miranda Richardson,[52] the film was based around the concept of The Red Shoes and featured six of the songs from the album.
The initial plan had been to take the songs out on the road, but no new tour transpired. Thus, Bush deliberately aimed for a live-band feel, with less of the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums and which would have been too difficult to re-create on stage.[53] The result alienated some of her fan base, who had enjoyed the intricacy of her earlier compositions,[54] but others found a new complexity in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed.[55]
This period had been a troubled time for Bush. She had suffered a series of bereavements, including the loss of guitarist Alan Murphy, who had started working with her on The Tour of Life in 1979, and her mother Hannah, to whom she was exceptionally close.[20] Many of the people she lost are honoured in the ballad "Moments of Pleasure." However, Bush's mother was still alive when "Moments of Pleasure" was written and recorded. Bush describes playing the song to her mother, who thought the line where she is quoted by Bush as saying, "Every old sock meets an old shoe," was hilarious and "couldn't stop laughing."[56]
After the release of The Red Shoes, Bush dropped out of the public eye for many years, although her name occasionally cropped up in the media with rumours of a new album release. Bush had originally intended to take one year off but despite working on material twelve years passed before her next album release.[57] The press often viewed her as an eccentric recluse, sometimes drawing a comparison with Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens's Great Expectations.[58] In reality, she was trying to give her young son a normal childhood, and needed a quiet place for her creative process to function.[57] In 1998, Bush had given birth to Albert, known as "Bertie", fathered by her guitarist and now-husband Danny McIntosh.[20][59] After living for many years on Court Road, Eltham, southeast London, the couple and their son moved away from the city and currently have two homes: a £2.5 million house in East Portlemouth on the Devon coast[59] and a mansion on an islet on the Kennet and Avon Canal at Sulhamstead in West Berkshire.[60] In 2001, Bush was awarded a Q Awards as Classic Songwriter.[61] In 2002, Kate Bush was awarded an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, and performed Comfortably Numb at David Gilmour's concert at the Royal Festival Hall in London.
Bush's eighth studio album, Aerial, was released on double CD and vinyl in November 2005.[20] The first single from the album was "King of the Mountain", which was played for the first time on BBC Radio 2 on 21 September 2005.[64]
As on Hounds of Love (1985), the album is divided into two sections, each with its own theme and mood.[65] The first disc, subtitled A Sea of Honey, features a set of unrelated themed songs, including "King of the Mountain"; "Bertie", a Renaissance-style ode to her son; and "Joanni", based on the story of Joan of Arc. In the song "", Bush sings 117 digits of the mathematical value of the number Pi,[65][66] but misses 22 digits from the 80th to the 101st place of the actual value of Pi. The second disc, subtitled A Sky of Honey, features one continuous piece of music describing the experience of being outdoors after waking at dawn, moving through afternoon, dusk, to night, then back to the following dawn of single summer's day. All the pieces in this suite refer or allude to sky and sea in their lyrical content. Bush mixed her voice with cooing woodpigeons to repeat the phrases "A sea of honey, a sky of honey," and "You're full of beauty" throughout the piece, and uses recordings of actual birdsong throughout. A Sky of Honey features Rolf Harris playing the didgeridoo on one track, and providing vocals on "The Painter's Link".[65] Other artists making guest appearances on the album include Peter Erskine, Eberhard Weber, Lol Creme, and Gary Brooker. Two tracks feature string arrangements by Michael Kamen, performed by the London Metropolitan Orchestra. A CD release of the single "King of the Mountain" included a cover of "Sexual Healing" by Marvin Gaye.[67]
"King of the Mountain" entered the UK Downloads Chart at number six on 17 October 2005,[68] and by 30 October it had become Bush's third-highest-charting single ever in the UK, peaking at number four on the full chart. Aerial entered the UK albums chart at number 3,[69] and the US chart at number 48.[70] Bush herself carried out relatively little publicity for the album, only conducting a handful of magazine and radio interviews. Aerial earned Bush two nominations at the 2006 BRIT Awards, for Best British Female Solo Artist and Best British Album.[71]
In late 2007, Bush composed and recorded a new song, "Lyra", for the soundtrack to the fantasy film The Golden Compass.[72]
On 16 May 2011, Bush released the album Director's Cut. The album, which Bush has described as an entirely new project rather than a collection of mere remixes, contains 11 tracks of substantially reworked material from her earlier albums The Sensual World and The Red Shoes, all of which have been recorded using analogue, rather than digital, equipment to create "a warmer sound". All the tracks have new lead vocals, new drums, and radically reworked instrumentation. Some of them have been transposed to a lower key to accommodate her lowering voice. Three of the songs, including "This Woman's Work", have been completely re-recorded, with lyrics often changed in places.[73] The album has been met with a wide range of reviews with most reviewers a bit confused about the concept of the album itself, while responding with varying degrees of enthusiasm about its revamped tracks. Of particular note is the warmer, more intimate tone of the songs and the richer, more mature sound of her voice.[74][75] This is the first album on her new label, Fish People, a division of EMI Records, with whom she's had a relationship since she started recording. In addition to the album Director's Cut in both its single CD form and in a box-set with The Sensual World and the analogue re-mastered The Red Shoes, Fish People will be releasing re-mastered editions of The Hounds of Love and The Dreaming.[76] The album debuted at number 2 on the United Kingdom chart.[77]
The song "The Sensual World" has been renamed "Flower of the Mountain" and contains a passage of Molly Bloom's famous soliloquy from James Joyce's novel Ulysses. Bush said, "Originally when I wrote the song "The Sensual World", I had used text from the end of Ulysses. When I asked for permission to use the text I was refused, which was disappointing. I then wrote my own lyrics for the song, although I felt that the original idea had been more interesting. Well, I'm not James Joyce am I? When I came to work on this project I thought I would ask for permission again and this time they said yes."[78]
The first single released from the album was "Deeper Understanding" and contains a new chorus featuring computerised vocals from Bush's son, Albert. A video for the song, directed by Bush, has been released through her channel on YouTube. It features Robbie Coltrane as a man consumed by his relationship with his computer (voiced by Bush's son). Frances Barber plays the man's wife, and Noel Fielding also appears.
Bush's next studio album, 50 Words for Snow, was released on 21 November 2011. The album contains seven new songs "set against a backdrop of falling snow," with a total running time of 65 minutes.[79][80] A radio edit of the first single, "Wild Man," was played on BBC Radio 2's 'Ken Bruce' show on 10 October.[81] and was released as a digital download on 11 October.[82] The album is distributed in the United States by Anti-Records.
On 14 November 2011, NPR played 50 Words for Snow in its entirety for the first time.[83] Australia's ABC Radio National declared 50 Words for Snow album of the week of 12 November 2011.[84]
The album's songs are built around Bush's quietly jazzy piano and Steve Gadd's drums, and utilise both sung and spoken word vocals in what Classic Rock's Stephen Dalton calls "a ... supple and experimental affair, with a comtemporary chamber pop sound grounded in crisp piano, minimal percussion and light-touch electronics ... billowing jazz-rock soundscapes, interwoven with fragmentary narratives delivered in a range of voices from shrill to Laurie Anderson-style cooing."[85] Bassist Danny Thompson appears on the album, which also features performances by Elton John and actor Stephen Fry.
On the first track, "Snowflake," in a song written specifically to use his still high choir-boy voice,[86] Bush's son Albert (Bertie) sings the role of a falling snowflake in a song expressing the hope of a noisy world soon being hushed by snowfall. "Snowflake" drifts into "Lake Tahoe", where choral singer Stefan Roberts and Bush sing about a rarely seen ghost: a woman who appears in a Victorian gown to call to her dog, Snowflake. Bush explained to fellow musician Jamie Cullum in an interview on Dutch Radio[87] that she wished to explore using high male voices in contrast to her own, deeper, voice. "Misty" is about a snowman lover who melts away after a night of passion, while "Wild Man" tells the story of a group of climbers in the Himalayas who, upon finding evidence of a nearby Yeti, erase all traces of it to protect it from discovery. Elton John and Bush as eternally divided lovers trade vocals on "Snowed in at Wheeler Street", while Stephen Fry recites the "50 Words for Snow". The quiet "Among Angels" finishes the album.[88]
50 Words for Snow received general acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 88, based on 26 reviews, which indicates "universal acclaim".[89] She was nominated for a Brit Award in the "Best Female Artist" category,[90] and the album won the 2012 Best Album at the South Bank Arts Awards,[91] and was also nominated for Best Album at the Ivor Novello Awards.[92]
Bush turned down an invitation by the organizers of the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony to perform at the event. Instead a recording of a new remix of her 1985 hit "Running Up that Hill" was played at the end of the ceremony.[93] The remix which was released on 12 August 2012 was based on the 1985 12" single remix, has new lead vocals and was transposed down a semitone to fit Bush's current lower vocal range. The remix entered the UK Singles Chart at number 6 the following week.[94]
Bush released an exclusive limited-edition 10" picture disc of the 2012 remix of Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God) as part of Record Store Day 2013 on 20 April 2013.
Bush has a soprano vocal range.[95] Her music is eclectic, varying styles even within an album. Her songs span genres as diverse as rock, pop, alternative and art rock.[1] Even in her earliest works where the piano was a primary instrument, she wove together many diverse influences, combining classical music, rock, and a wide range of ethnic and folk sources, and this has continued throughout her career.
In an interview with Melody Maker magazine in 1977, she revealed that male artists had more influence on her work than females, stating: "Every female you see at a piano is either Lynsey de Paul, or Carole King. And most male music—not all of it but the good stuff—really lays it on you. It really puts you against the wall and that's what I like to do. I'd like my music to intrude. Not many females succeed with that."[13]
The experimental nature of her music has led it to be described as a later, more technological, and more accessible manifestation of the British progressive rock movement.[17][96] Southern England was the home to the most influential and successful acts of the progressive rock movement and,[96] like other artists in this genre, Bush rejects the classic American style of making pop music, which was adopted by most UK pop artists. Bush's vocals contain elements of British, Anglo-Irish and most prominently (southern) English accents and, in its utilisation of musical instruments from many periods and cultures, her music has differed from American pop norms.[96] Elements of Bush's lyrics tend to be more unusual and less clichéd than American-style pop lyrics, often employing historical or literary references and avoiding autobiographical lyrics. She considers herself a storyteller who embodies the character singing the song and strenuously rejects efforts by others to insist that her songs are autobiographical.[96][97][98]
Reviewers have used the term "surreal" to describe her music.[99] Many of her songs have a melodramatic emotional and musical surrealism that defies easy categorisation.[100] It has been observed that even the more joyous pieces are often tinged with traces of melancholy, and even the most sorrowful pieces have elements of vitality struggling against all that would oppress them.[101]
Her lyrics have referenced a wide array of subject matter, often relatively obscure, as in G. I. Gurdjieff in the song "Them Heavy People", while "Deeper Understanding", from The Sensual World, portrays a person who stays indoors, obsessively talking to a computer and shunning human contact. "Cloudbusting" was inspired by Peter Reich's autobiography, "Book of Dreams", about his relationship with his father, Wilhelm Reich. In a retrospective review of "Cloudbusting", Allmusic journalist Amy Hanson praised the song for "the rich earth of imagery that Bush has tilled throughout her entire career, emerging both tender and brutal." Commending the song for having "a thoughtful lyric and a compulsive cello-driven melody", Hanson wrote: "Even more startling, but hardly surprising, is the ease with which Bush was able to capture the moment when a child first realizes that adults are fallible and the parental cocoon is tenuous at best."[102]
Comedy is also a big influence on her and is a significant component of her work. She has cited Woody Allen,[103] Monty Python, Fawlty Towers, and The Young Ones[104] as particular favourites. Horror movies are another interest of Bush's and have influenced the gothic nature of several of her songs, such as "Hounds of Love", inspired by the 1957 horror movie Night of the Demon.[105] Her songs have occasionally combined comedy and horror to form dark humour, such as murder by poisoning in "Coffee Homeground", an alcoholic mother in "Ran Tan Waltz" and the upbeat "The Wedding List", a song inspired by François Truffaut's 1967 film of Cornell Woolrich's The Bride Wore Black about the death of a groom and the bride's subsequent revenge against the killer.[106]
In 1983 New Musical Express noted that Bush was not afraid to tackle what was described as sensitive and taboo subjects.[107] "The Kick Inside" is based on a traditional English folk song (The Ballad of Lucy Wan) about an incestuous pregnancy and a resulting suicide.[108] "Kashka from Baghdad" is a song about a homosexual male couple;[109] Out magazine listed two of her albums in their Top 100 Greatest Gayest albums list.[110] "The Infant Kiss" is a song about a haunted, unstable woman's almost paedophile infatuation with a young boy in her care (inspired by Jack Clayton's film The Innocents (1961), which had been based on Henry James's famous novella The Turn of the Screw);[111][112] and "Breathing" explores the results of nuclear fallout from the perspective of an unborn child in the womb.[113]
The length of time between album releases has led to rumours in the media concerning her health or appearance.[104] In the past, stories of weight gain or mental instability have been disproved by Bush's periodic reappearance.[114] In 2011 Bush told BBC Radio 4 that the amount of time between album releases is extremely stressful noting: "It's very frustrating the albums take as long as they do ... I wish there weren't such big gaps between them." In the same interview Bush denied she was a perfectionist in the studio, saying: "I think it's important that things are flawed ... That's what makes a piece of art interesting sometimes – the bit that's wrong or the mistake you've made that's led onto an idea you wouldn't have had otherwise," and reiterated her prioritisation of her family life.[97]
Bush's only tour took place 2 April – 13 May 1979, after which she has given only the occasional live performance. Several reasons have been suggested as to why she abandoned touring, among them her reputed need to be in total control of the final product, which is incompatible with live stage performance, a rumour of a crippling fear of flying,[115] and the suggestion that the death of 21-year-old Bill Duffield severely affected her.[116] Duffield, her lighting engineer, was killed in an accident during her 2 April 1979 concert at Poole Arts Centre. Bush held a benefit concert on 12 May 1979, with Peter Gabriel and Steve Harley at London's Hammersmith Odeon for his family. Duffield would be honoured in two later songs: "Blow Away" on Never for Ever and "Moments of Pleasure" on The Red Shoes. Bush explained in a BBC Radio 2 interview with Mark Radcliffe that she actually enjoyed the tour but was consumed with producing her subsequent records. A BBC film crew followed the preparation for the tour which was shown on the BBC Nationwide program as a 30-minute special.
During the same period as her tour, she made numerous television appearances around the world, including Top of the Pops in the United Kingdom, Bios Bahnhof in Germany, and Saturday Night Live in the United States (with Paul Shaffer on piano).[117] On 28 December 1979, BBC TV aired the Kate Bush Christmas Special. It was recorded in October 1979 at the BBC Studios in Birmingham, England; choreography by Anthony Van Laast.[118] As well as playing songs from her first two albums, she played "December Will Be Magic Again", "Violin", "The Wedding List", "Ran Tan Waltz" and "Egypt" from her forthcoming album, Never for Ever. Peter Gabriel made a guest appearance to play "Here Comes the Flood", and a duet of Roy Harper's "Another Day" with Bush.[119]
"I do have the odd dream where I'm on stage and I've completely forgotten what I'm meant to be performing - so they are more nightmares than dreams."
After the Tour of Life, Bush desired to make two more albums before touring again. At that point, she got involved with production techniques and sound experimentation that took up a lot of time and prevented her from touring. She came close to touring again following the release of The Dreaming and The Red Shoes, but live shows never materialized.[121]
In 1982, Bush participated in the first benefit concert in aid of The Prince's Trust alongside artists such as Madness, Midge Ure, Phil Collins, Mick Karn and Pete Townshend. On 25 April 1986 Bush performed live for British charity event Comic Relief, singing "Do Bears... ?", a humorous duet with Rowan Atkinson, and a rendition of "Breathing". On 28 June 1987, she made a guest appearance to duet with Peter Gabriel on "Don't Give Up" at Earl's Court, London as part of his "So" tour. In March 1987, Bush sang "Running Up that Hill" at The Secret Policeman's Third Ball accompanied by David Gilmour.
On 17 January 2002, Bush appeared with her long-time champion, David Gilmour, singing the part of the doctor in "Comfortably Numb" at the Royal Festival Hall in London.
In 2011 Bush told the magazine Classic Rock: "I do hope that some time I get a chance to do some shows. Maybe not a tour, but something"[121]
In March 2014 Bush announced a 22-night residency called Before the Dawn in London from 26 August – 1 October 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo, her first live shows in 35 years. The tickets sold out in 15 minutes.[92][122]
In 1979 Bush's one live show, The Tour of Life, was recorded for the BBC and for release on VHS as Kate Bush Live at Hammersmith Odeon.[123]
Bush has appeared in innovative music videos designed to accompany her singles releases. Among the best known are those for "Running Up that Hill", "Babooshka", "Breathing", "Wuthering Heights", and "The Man with the Child in His Eyes", and "Cloudbusting", featuring actor Donald Sutherland, who made time during the filming of another project to take part in the video.[124] EMI has released collections of her videos, including The Single File, Hair of the Hound, The Whole Story, a career video overview released in conjunction with the 1986 compilation album of the same title,[123] and The Sensual World.
In 1993, she directed and starred in the short film, The Line, the Cross & the Curve, a musical co-starring Miranda Richardson, featuring music from Bush's album The Red Shoes, which was inspired by the classic movie of the same name. It was released on VHS in the UK in 1994 and also received a small number of cinema screenings around the world. In recent interviews, Bush has said that she considers it a failure, and stated in 2001: "I'm very pleased with four minutes of it, but I'm very disappointed with the rest."[125] In a 2005 interview, she described the film as "A load of bollocks."[126]
In 1994, Bush provided the music used in a series of psychedelic-themed television adverts for the soft drink Fruitopia that appeared in the United States. The same company aired the adverts in the United Kingdom, but the British version featured singer Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins instead of Bush.[127]
In late 2006, a DVD documentary titled Kate Bush Under Review was released by Sexy Intellectual, which included archival interviews with Bush, along with interviews with a selection of music historians and journalists (including Phil Sutcliffe, Nigel Williamson, and Morris Pert). The DVD also includes clips from several of Bush's music videos.[128]
On 2 December 2008, the DVD collection of the fourth season of Saturday Night Live, including her performances, was released.[129] A three DVD set of The Secret Policeman's Balls benefit concerts that includes Bush's performance was released on 27 January 2009.[130]
Bush has released four short videos for the album 50 Words for Snow. One is an advertisement for the album. Two stop-motion "Animation Segments" were posted on the Kate Bush Official website and YouTube, one to accompany a 2-minute 25 second section of "Misty", called "Mistraldespair", the other to accompany a 2-minute 33 second section of "Wild Man". "Mistraldespair" was directed by Bush and animated by Gary Pureton,[131] while the "Wild Man" segment was created by Finn and Patrick at Brandt Animation.[132] On 24 January 2012, a third piece called "Eider Falls at Lake Tahoe", was premiered on her website and on YouTube. Running at 5:01, the piece is a sepia tone shadow puppet animation. Directed by Bush and photographed by award-winning British cinematographer Roger Pratt, the shadow puppets were designed by Robert Allsopp.[133] Bush stated that "Eider Falls at Lake Tahoe" is intended to be a "self contained piece" separate from the song "Lake Tahoe".[134]
In 1990, Bush starred in the black comedy film Les Dogs, produced by The Comic Strip for BBC television. Aired on 8 March 1990, Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic version of Britain. While Bush's is a silent presence in a wedding dress throughout most of the film, she does have several lines of dialogue with Peter Richardson in two dream sequences. In another Comic Strip Presents film, GLC, she produced the theme song "Ken", which includes a vocal performance by Bush. The song was written about Ken Livingstone, the leader of the Greater London Council, who would later be elected as mayor of London and at the time was working with musicians to help the Labour Party garner the youth vote.[135]
She also produced all the incidental music, which is synthesiser based. Bush wrote and performed the song "The Magician", in a fairground-like arrangement, for Menahem Golan's 1979 film The Magician of Lublin.[136] In 1985, Bush contributed a darkly melancholic version of the Ary Barroso song "Brazil" to the soundtrack of the Terry Gilliam film Brazil. The track was scored and arranged by Michael Kamen. In 1986, she wrote and recorded "Be Kind to My Mistakes" for the Nicolas Roeg film Castaway. An edited version of this track was used as the B-side to her 1989 single "This Woman's Work". In 1988, the song "This Woman's Work" was featured in the John Hughes film She's Having a Baby, and a slightly remixed version appeared on Bush's album The Sensual World.[137] The song has since appeared on numerous television shows, and in 2005 reached number eight on the UK download chart after featuring in a British television advertisement for the charity NSPCC.[138]
In 1999, Bush wrote and recorded a song for the Disney film Dinosaur, but the track was ultimately not included on the soundtrack. According to the winter 1999 issue of HomeGround, a Bush fanzine, it was scrapped when Disney asked her to rewrite the song and she refused. Also in 1999, Bush's song "The Sensual World" was featured prominently in Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan's film "Felicia's Journey".[139] "The Man with the Child in His Eyes" is on the soundtrack for the 2007 British romantic comedy film Starter for 10.[140]
In 2007, Bush was asked to write a song for The Golden Compass soundtrack which made reference to the lead character, Lyra Belacqua. The song, "Lyra", was used in the closing credits of the film, reached number 187 in the UK Singles Chart[141] and was nominated for the International Press Academy's Satellite Award for original song in a motion picture.[142][143]
According to Del Palmer, Bush was asked to compose the song on very short notice and the whole project was completed in 10 days.[144] The song was produced and recorded by Bush in her own studio, and features the Magdalen College, Oxford choir.
Bush provided vocals on two of Peter Gabriel's albums, including the hits "Games Without Frontiers" and "Don't Give Up", as well as "No Self-Control". Gabriel appeared on Bush's 1979 television special, where they sang a duet of Roy Harper's "Another Day". She has sung on two Roy Harper tracks, "You", on his 1979 album, "The Unknown Soldier", and "Once", the title track of his 1990 album. She has also sung on the title song of the 1986 Big Country album The Seer, the Midge Ure song "Sister and Brother" from his 1988 album Answers to Nothing, Go West's 1987 single "The King Is Dead" and two songs with Prince – "Why Should I Love You?", from her 1993 album The Red Shoes, and in 1996, the song "My Computer" from Prince's album Emancipation. In 1987, she sang a verse on the charity single "Let It Be" by Ferry Aid. She sang a line on the charity single "Spirit of the Forest" by Spirit of the Forest in 1989.
1990 saw Kate producing, for the only time in her career, one song for another artist, Alan Stivell's "Kimiad", on his album Again. Stivell had appeared on The Sensual World. In 1991, Kate Bush was invited to perform a cover of Elton John 1972 song Rocket Man for the tribute album Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin. In 2011, Elton John collaborated with Bush once again in Snowed In A Wheeler Street for her most recent album 50 Words for Snow. In 1994, Bush covered George Gershwin's "The Man I Love" for the tribute album The Glory of Gershwin. In 1996, Bush contributed a version of "Mná na hÉireann" (Irish for "Women of Ireland") for the Anglo-Irish folk-rock compilation project Common Ground: The Voices of Modern Irish Music. Bush had to sing the song in Irish, which she learned to do phonetically.[145]
Artists who have contributed to Bush's own albums include Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, David Gilmour, Nigel Kennedy, Gary Brooker, and Prince. Bush provided backing vocals for a song that was recorded during the 1990s titled Wouldn't Change a Thing by Lionel Azulay, the drummer with the original band that was later to become the KT Bush Band. The song, which was engineered and produced by Del Palmer, is available for download and will be on Azulay's upcoming CD.[146][147]
Bush declined a request by Erasure to produce one of their albums because "she didn't feel that that was her area".[148]
In 2010, Bush provided vocals for Rolf Harris's cover of the traditional Irish song "She Moves Through the Fair". Harris, who described the collaboration as the "best thing I've done," is unsure of how to release the track.[149]
From the 1980s onward, it has become almost standard for individualistic female singer-songwriters to be compared to Bush by the media. She has been noted as an influence on female artists such as Madonna,[150][151][152][153] Annie Lennox,[154] Tori Amos,[155] PJ Harvey,[40][156][157] Björk,[158] Alanis Morissette,[159] Sinead O'Connor,[160] Dolores O'Riordan of The Cranberries,[161] Courtney Love of Hole,[162][163] Gwen Stefani of No Doubt,[164] Milla Jovovich,[165][166] Regina Spektor,[167] Fiona Apple,[168] k.d. lang,[169] Dido,[164] KT Tunstall,[170] Paula Cole,[171][172] Lady Gaga,[173] Alison Goldfrapp of Goldfrapp,[174][175][176] M.I.A.,[177] Imogen Heap,[178] Feist,[179] Katie Melua,[180][181] Lily Allen,[182] Leona Lewis,[183] Jane Siberry,[161] Nerina Pallot,[184] Joanna Newsom,[185] Bat for Lashes,[186] Happy Rhodes,[187] Kate Nash,[185] Little Boots,[188][189][190] Karen O[191] of New York band Yeah Yeah Yeahs, St. Vincent,[192][193] Marina Diamandis,[194] Ladyhawke[195] and Florence Welch of Florence + the Machine,[196][197] in addition to Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode,[198] Kurt Cobain of Nirvana,[199] Tupac Shakur,[200][201][202] Prince,[150] Radiohead,[203] Robert Smith of The Cure,[204] Ozzy Osbourne,[205] Antony and the Johnsons,[159] Muse,[170] Coldplay,[206] OutKast,[156] Tricky,[207] Placebo,[208] Wild Beasts,[209][210][211][212] Bloc Party,[213] Cocteau Twins,[185] Bon Iver,[214] Niki & The Dove,[215] Bright Light Bright Light,[216] London Grammar[217] and The Decemberists.[218] Her artistry has been reflected in the music of female artists such as Natalie Merchant, Liz Phair, Ani DiFranco, Cat Power, Suzanne Vega, Natalie Imbruglia[219] and Shakira.[220][221] Ariel Pink wrote a tribute song for her titled "For Kate I Wait" on the album The Doldrums. The trip-hop artist Tricky has said about Bush, "I don't believe in God, but if I did, her music would be my bible".[20]
Punk rocker John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols, declared her work to be "beauty beyond belief",[222] and labelled her "a true original". Rotten once wrote a song for her, titled "Bird in Hand" (about exploitation of parrots) that Bush rejected. Rotten theorised that Bush thought the song contained insulting references aimed at her.[223][224] In November 2006, the singer Rufus Wainwright named Bush as one of his top ten gay icons.[225] Outside music, Bush has been an inspiration to several fashion designers, most notably Hussein Chalayan.[226] Welsh movie star Catherine Zeta-Jones expressed her admiration to Bush music, especially praising The Red Shoes music video.[204]
Many artists around the world have recorded cover versions of Bush songs, including Charlotte Church, Wild Beasts,[227] The Futureheads (who had a UK top ten hit with a cover of "Hounds of Love"), Placebo (whose cover of "Running Up that Hill" has featured in many TV series and films), Faith and the Muse, Hayley Westenra, Jane Birkin, Ra Ra Riot,[228][229] Maxwell,[230] The Church[231] and Nada Surf.[232] The British dance act Utah Saints sampled a line from "Cloudbusting" for their single, "Something Good". Artists such as Pat Benatar,[233] Röyksopp,[234] Natalie Cole,[235] Sarah McLachlan,[236] Tori Amos,[237] Lara Fabian,[238] Elisa, Nolwenn Leroy, Patrick Wolf,[239] Solange Knowles, younger sister of Beyoncé[240] and Happy Rhodes (whose upper vocal range has been compared with the one of Kate Bush)[241] have covered her songs in live performances. Coldplay said their track "Speed of Sound" was originally an attempt to re-create "Running Up that Hill".[242]
Suede front-man Brett Anderson has stated that "Wuthering Heights" was the first single he ever bought and mentioned "And Dream of Sheep" in Suede's song "These are the Sad Songs".[243] British folk singer Jim Moray also references "And Dream of Sheep" in his self-penned track "Longing for Lucy".[244] Progressive death metal act Novembre also covered "Cloudbusting" on their album Novembrine Waltz. In 2009, John Forté released a hip hop version of "Running Up that Hill".[245]
In 2010, composer and vocalist Theo Bleckmann released an album of Kate Bush covers, titled Hello Earth! – The Music of Kate Bush which includes his interpretation of fourteen Bush classics,[246] which he also performs live around the world. In an interview with Hungarian online music magazine Kortár's Blog, Bleckmann explained his choice to explore Bush's work: "The music of Kate Bush has been a saviour throughout my teenage years when I lived in a small town in Germany ... To come back to her music fresh ... and to discover more depths and beauty in it, became an overwhelming confirmation of the endurance of great music regardless of genre and time."[247][248]
Bush is married to guitarist Dan McIntosh, and the couple have a son, Albert.[249] She is a former resident of Eltham, south east London.[250]
In the 1990s Bush moved to a canalside residence in Sulhamstead, Berkshire and subsequently moved to Devon in 2004[251] and was reported as still living there in April 2013.[252]

British singer/songwriter Kate Bush's idiosyncratic style has proved immensely popular in her homeland and around the world. Her debut single, "Wuthering Heights," hit #1 in the U.K. a month after its release in January 1978 and went onto become the year's best-selling single there and in Australia (only Abba was more popular in Western Europe). But except for "Running Up That Hill" (#30, 1985), Bush has yet to achieve the same broad popularity in the U.S., though her albums, particularly her later, more mature works, have been critically well received. Nonetheless, she has proved a major influence on artists such as Sinead O'Connor, Jane Siberry, Bjork, Tori Amos, and Dolores O'Riordan of the Cranberries.
Bush was something of an art-rock prodigy. The daughter of a British physician, Bush began playing the piano at the age of 11. She had been writing songs for two years when family friends told Dave Gilmour of Pink Floyd about the 16-year-old's four-octave range and interest in the supernatural. Gilmour financed the demo tape that got her signed to EMI. Because of her age and developing talent, she spent the next two years studying music, dance and mime and writing the songs for her first album, recorded in 1977 under the supervision of Gilmour and producer Andrew Powell (Pink Floyd, Alan Parsons, Cockney Rebel). The album was preceded by the release of "Wuthering Heights." The song's runaway success also spurred sales of the Emily Bronte novel. Pat Benatar covered the song on Crimes of Passion.
The Kick Inside went to the U.K. Top 10, and two singles —"The Man With the Child in His Eyes" (#85, 1987) and "Wow" from Lionheart —made the Top 20. Bush's double EP of concert recordings also cracked the Top 10. She sang on Peter Gabriel's eponymous 1980 album, and her elaborately theatrical self-produced The Dreaming, which entered the U.K. chart at #3, shows his influence. Soon thereafter, she constructed a state-of-the art studio in her home, where she records. A known perfectionist, Bush uses the studio as an instrument, much the way Brian Wilson did, and her recordings evince a range of influences and styles, from Celtic to Middle Eastern music, and a mastery of rock and pop idioms, from lavish ballads to hard rockers.
Her next release, The Hounds of Love (#30 U.S., #1 U.K., 1985) featured her biggest U.S. single, "Running Up That Hill," as well as two other U.K. Top 20 singles, "Cloudbusting" and the title track. Her 1986 retrospective album and video, The Whole Story, was another #1 U.K. hit. With The Sensual World, Bush returned to literature for her inspiration, namely James Joyce's Molly Bloom, on whose soliloquies in Ulysses Bush based the title track's concept. This Woman's Work is a box set.
After a four-year hiatus, Bush returned with the ambitious (some critics thought confused) The Red Shoes, its title taken from the 1948 Michael Powell film (which was based on a Hans Christian Andersen tale) about a young ballerina. Bush, who had long been directing her own evocative videos, wrote, directed, and costarred (with
performance artist-mime master Lindsay Kemp and actress Miranda Richardson) in her own 50-minute film. After six years without any solo activity, Bush started work on a

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Kate Bush began playing piano at a young age and, by her mid-teens, had composed over 200 songs. Her talent caught the notice of David Gilmour (of Pink Floyd) who assisted in arranging her contract with EMI. The first song she released, "Wuthering Heights", soared to #1 in England in 1978. Since then, Kate has achieved a notable career as a singer and musician. Kate began producing her own albums and videos early on. Her growing interest in film was highly evident in the 1985 video for her song, "Cloudbusting", which starred Donald Sutherland, which is a mini-film in itself. Another 1985 video, "Hounds of Love", is a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock. Following the release of her 1993 album, "The Red Shoes", influenced by filmmaker Michael Powell, Kate produced the short film, The Line, the Cross & the Curve (1993), using five songs from the album as a basis for the film in a mysterious, mythical retelling of the tale of "The Red Shoes".
      Signed to EMI Records at age 16. Her first single. "Wuthering Heights," topped the English charts a year later.
      Designed and invented a wireless microphone headset developed to enable her to sing and perform her complicated dancing at the same time.
      Since her early teens, Kate had an unusual love for music, eventually leading up to a 1978 album debut with "The Kick Inside", by which time her single, "Wuthering Heights", had entered the charts. Almost 30 years down the road, Kate has been a high influence on numerous women in the music business. These women include Stevie Nicks, Björk, Sarah McLachlan, Tori Amos, Elizabeth Fraser (of The Cocteau Twins) Pat Benatar, Dido, K.T. Tunstall, Katie Melua, Rihanna, Alison Goldfrapp (of Goldfrapp) Toyah Willcox, Paula Cole and Chrissie Hynde (of The Pretenders).
      Shares a birthday with Emily Brontë, author of the book "Wuthering Heights" on which her hit song was based.
Tori Amos, Natalie Cole, Dusty Springfield, Within Temptation, and Pat Benatar covered songs of hers.
      Although it has become one of her most popular recordings, Bush was not Peter Gabriel's first choice to sing the emotional duet "Don't Give Up" with him. He originally wanted American country singer Dolly Parton, but she turned it down on the grounds that she didn't know who he was. However, Gabriel later described Bush's vocal on the song as "tremendous".
      She was awarded the CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2013 Queen's New Years Honours list for her services to Music. She is a singer and songwriter.

      In 1983, she had a 24-track studio built in the barn behind her family home where the recording sessions for "Hounds of Love" took place over two years.
      When I'm writing I've been playing something for a couple of hours and I'm almost in a trance. At two or three in the morning you can actually see bits inspiration floating about and grab them.
      On her meeting and demonstrating her talents to Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour: "Absolutely terrified and trembling like a leaf, I sat down and played for him. He came along to see me and he was great, such a human, kind person - and genuine."
      Regarding her directorial debut, The Line, the Cross & the Curve (1993): "I shouldn't have done it. I was so tired. I'm very pleased with four minutes of it, but I'm very disappointed with the rest. I let down people like Miranda Richardson, who worked so hard on it. I had the opportunity to do something really interesting and I completely blew it".
      I am a private person, but I don't think I'm obsessively so. It's more that I choose to try and have as normal a life as possible. I don't like to live in the glare of publicity.
      I'm very opinionated. I'm so fussy and picky. What's good is that I know what I want. It's when you don't know what you want when you're in trouble.
      Roy (Roy Harper) is one of the greatest English songwriters we've had, and people just don't realise it. And I really think that when they do we're going to have another top songwriter up there. He's brilliant.
      It's interesting how many young people are getting into old records, because there's a buzz they just can't get from contemporary music. Look how many old songs are hits again. (Speaking in 1993)
      They were just so beautifully, beautifully written, and they still stand up, and for pop music it's so well crafted. On every level: not just the songs but the arrangements and the vocal performances. (On the songs of The Beatles)
      I don't think of myself as a musician. I only ever play the piano to accompany myself singing. I could never sit and read a piece of music. At best, I'm an accompanist.
      I like classical music, but I wish I was more eloquent with it. I hear things and think, 'That's beautiful,' but don't know what it is. As you get older, you do get more into instrumental music, don't you? It's as if as you get older you don't want people telling you what they think or what you've got to think or do. Also, those great composers really knew what they were doing. A lot of contemporary art is made by people who haven't got any talent. Art made by talentless people can sometimes really work, but it's not the same as real craft.
      There's a lot of other stuff that I like to do. But I find making records really exciting. It's making something out of nothing and you can involve other people. It's brilliant.
      At one point I had this, well, I don't know if you'd call it a crush, a bit of one on Elton John. I thought he was fantastic. I thought he was so clever. It was before he got really famous...around Madman Across the Water. I thought he was so wonderful. I'd play the records and dream of being able to play like him, those fantastic hands. But a crush like that is quite sweet, isn't it? I had David Bowie on my wall, as well.
      I was never really driven to be famous. Even from a young age, when I knew I wanted to be involved in music, it was really making an album, that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to try and make interesting music. So I think my values have always remained the same.
      I don't think I could really say that I've ever really been that happy with anything I've done. I think you are at the time and I always try my best and put lots of effort into the albums.
      The Red Shoes was recorded with digital equipment. At the time it was state of the art, what everybody was kind of pressurized to be using really, but in hindsight I felt that it had a very edgy sound.
      You create something and you have an intention that goes with that at the time, but once you release it, it's really up to other people how they interpret it or see it. It's like a painting. I'm sure half the time people look at a painting, they've no idea what the artist originally was thinking of. I'm not sure it matters. I think if you can get something from it, if it's at all thought-provoking or it makes you feel something, then I think that's the achievement.
      [on The Dreaming] It was very important that it happened to me because it made me think "Right, do I really want to produce my own stuff? Do I really care about being famous?" And I was very pleased with myself that no, it didn't matter as much as making a good album.
      [on The Dreaming] I felt the album had done very well to reach number three but I felt under a lot of pressure and I wanted to stay as close to my work as possible and everyone was saying Oh, she's really gone mad now.
      I think it was felt that me producing Hounds of Love wasn't such a good idea and for the first time I felt I was actually meeting resistance artistically.
=======================================================
One of the most successful and popular solo female performers to come out of England during the last several decades of the 20th century, Kate Bush was also one of the most unusual, with her keening vocals and unusually literate and complex body of songs. As a girl, Catherine Bush studied piano and violin while attending the St. Joseph's Convent Grammar School in Abbey Wood in South London. She also amused herself playing an organ in the barn behind her parents' house. By the time she was a teenager, Bush was writing songs of her own. A family friend, Ricky Hopper, heard her music and brought Bush to the attention of Pink Floyd lead guitarist David Gilmour, who arranged for the 15-year-old Bush to record her first demo. With Gilmour's help, Bush was signed to EMI Records at age 16, though the company made the decision to bring her along slowly. She studied dance, mime, and voice, and continued writing. She also began thinking in terms of which of the 200 or so songs she'd written would be part of her first recording, and by 1977, she was ready to begin her formal career, which she did with an original song, "Wuthering Heights," based on material from Emily Bronte's novel (and more directly inspired by Bush's seeing the 1970 film directed by Robert Fuest and starring Timothy Dalton and Anna Caulder Marshall). 
The song would set a pattern for much of her future work, which was filled with literary and other external thematic allusions, and sometimes made even fans feel as though her lyrics ideally would come with footnotes -- heady stuff for a teenage rock singer in the late '70s. Her precocity was demonstrated by the approach she took to the song, deliberately affecting what she felt -- in her mid-teens -- was the voice of a ghostly Cathy, whom she regarded as a dangerous, grasping figure, reaching out to her lover even from the grave. "Wuthering Heights" rose to number one on the British charts when it was released in 1978, and Bush became an overnight sensation at the age of 19. Her debut album, The Kick Inside, a collection of material that she had written from 15 onward, some of it displaying extremely provocative and sophisticated sexual references and images, reached number three and sold over a million copies in the U.K.
Bush's second album, Lionheart, reached number six but didn't achieve anything like the sales totals or critical acclaim of its predecessor, and in later years Bush regretted the rush involved in planning and recording that album to capitalize on the success of her debut. In England during the spring of 1979, Bush embarked on what proved to be the only concert tour of her career to date, playing a series of shows highlighted by 17 costume changes, lots of dancing, and complex lighting. Bush was also apparently the first rock performer (at least since the days in the early '60s when Sweden's Spotnicks experimented with a more primitive version of the technology) to make use of a wireless voice microphone, which freed her up to move around the stage as few singers before her had been capable of doing. The tour proved both exhausting and financially disastrous, and ever since then Bush has avoided any but the most limited live concert appearances, primarily in support of certain charitable causes. This absence from the concert stage, the extended periods -- often as much as three to five years -- between albums, and the dense, reference-filled nature of her songs and lyrics have also resulted in Bush becoming one of the more enigmatic pop artists in England since the Beatles; her relatively private personal life has only added to the mystique surrounding her. But her relative aloofness and her unusual sound and approach to pop music also made it more difficult to "explain" or encapsulate her work in a few words to the uninitiated, especially in America, where radio play and television exposure proved much harder to come by during the first few years of her career.
By the start of the 1980s, Bush was established as one of the most challenging and eccentric artists ever to have achieved success in rock music, with a range of sounds and interests that constantly challenged listeners, encompassing literature, art, poetry, cinema, history, and all manner of other subjects. "Babooshka" (1980) became her first Top Five single since "Wuthering Heights," and her subsequent album, Never for Ever, entered the British charts at number one in September of 1980. During this period, Bush began co-producing her own work, a decisive step toward refining her sound and also establishing her independence from her record company. Although 1982's The Dreaming reached number three, the single "There Goes a Tenner" failed to reach the charts, and most observers felt that Bush had lost her audience. Bush was unfazed by the criticism, and even began taking steps to make herself more independent of her record label by establishing a home studio, this partly in response to EMI's huge studio charges on her previous records -- from the mid-'80s onward, Bush was free to spend her time at her leisure working out her sound, and it seemed to pay off with her next release.
After two years' absence, Bush re-emerged in August of 1985 with "Running Up That Hill," which became her second biggest-selling single. The accompanying album, Hounds of Love, the first record made at her 48-track home studio, debuted on the British charts at the number one position in September of 1985 and remained there for a full month, and soon after "Running Up That Hill" gave Bush her long-awaited American breakthrough, reaching number 30 on Billboard's charts. By this time, in England Bush was ranked alongside Madonna in terms of her musical impact, "Running Up That Hill" having bumped "Like a Virgin" out of the number one chart position. The changes in her sound and her development as a writer/performer were showcased in the January 1987 best-of collection The Whole Story, for which she also re-recorded the lead vocal for "Wuthering Heights" to bring the song more in line with her sound as it was in her twenties (she later admitted that she would have liked to have done something similar with several of her other early recordings done when she was in her teens). The album also featured her latest single, "Experiment IV," whose lyrics were built on a science fiction story line that was echoed in the video, which Bush directed with a cast of familiar movie performers, and which came out like a miniaturized musical version of a Quatermass-like chiller. That same year, Bush won the Best British Female Artist award at the sixth-annual BRIT Awards in London. 
In October of 1989, Bush's first new album in almost four years, The Sensual World, reached the British number two spot, and received an unprecedented promotional push in America, where she signed with Columbia Records for her future releases. Bush's next album, The Red Shoes (1993), inspired by the 1948 film by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, debuted in the American Top 30, the first time one of her albums had ever charted that high -- Bush made a rare personal appearance in New York that December, an autograph signing at Tower Records on the Lower East Side, and the resulting line of admirers stretched almost six blocks, and required her to extend her appearance by several hours (she was still delighted and amazed by the procession five hours into the event). 
It would be another 12 years before Bush would resume her recording career. Rumors of a new album began circulating in the late '90s. During this time, Bush became a mother and quietly retreated to her countryside home in Berkshire, Reading, England. In 2005, Bush finally released her follow-up to The Red Shoes, the double-disc set Aerial. After another six-year silence, Bush released The Director's Cut in 2011. It was a collection of 11 redone songs taken from 1989's The Sensual World and 1993's The Red Shoes. Bush claimed she was never quite satisfied with what was released, and therefore decided to rework elements in the chosen songs -- she recut all of her vocals and drums, and left virtually everything else unchanged. That said, the title of the song "The Sensual World" was renamed "Flower of the Mountain," because there, Bush also changed the words. Bush proved somewhat prolific in 2011 when she released 50 Words for Snow on Anti in November, an all new concept recording containing seven long tracks. Jazz drummer Steve Gadd plays throughout, with Bush's son Bertie guesting on one track and Sir Elton John duetting with Bush on "Snowed in at Wheeler Street." ~ Bruce Eder, Rovi

Kate Bush has written some of the most memorable songs in pop music history. Wuthering Heights, her debut single shot to number 1 in 1978 and she remains something of an enigma over a quarter of a century later. A singer, songwriter, musician, dancer, actress and director, Kate has inspired a devoted following around the world. Rob Jovanovic traces the story of Kate Bush's career, from her up-bringing in the Essex countryside through her first forays into music with a series of home recordings, to her number 1 debut album that propelled her to international stardom. Including exclusive interviews with studio musicians and choreographers, Jovanovic's biography emphasizes both her voracious talent and her intensely private personality. Over the last ten years, Kate Bush has taken time out from her hugely successful musical career to raise a family. In November 2005 however, she released Aerial, her first album in 12 years, to great critical acclaim.

       Written with fondness and filled with train-spotterish-details about recording sessions and musicians. (The Times)
       Rob Jovanovic has written about music for numerous magazines, including Mojo, Q, Level, Record Collector and Uncut, and many other publications such as The Guinness Rockopedia and The Rare Record Price Guide. He is a full-time music writer based in Nottingham.

  Agree totally with the review posted before this. What you have here is a cut and paste run through press comments combined with detailed break downs of her albums. It's ironic that an artist so careful to craft all her work is served by an easy to assemble bio that still gets facts wrong. It's predictable at best and often lazy and sloppy. The author notes that Kate signed to EMI home to some of the 70s biggest bands including Deep Purple and Iron Maiden....check the dates of Iron Maiden's hits if that one passed you by. Similarly a musician called Robin Trowe gets a mention and the book frequently repeats facts quickly, citing the chart position of one single twice in two pages. It also came out around the time of Ariel but - of course - has nothing to say about it. The last one is probably simple bad luck for the author, the many other slips and typos aren't.
  For some time now,admirers of the notoriously private Ms Bush have longed for a biography packed with little known facts about her life with some light shed on the inspiration for her music and peppered with insightful observations from those lucky enough to have worked with her.This book is not it!.It is poorly researched and badly written.Most of Kates quotes seem to have been lifted from ancient copies of 'Q' magazine (for whom the compiler of this work,Rob Jovanovic, is a contributer)and subsequently offers no new information to the fans.As a biographer,Mr Jovanovic does not seem to have grasped the fact that it is not enough merely to list the names of his subjects first boyfriend /dance teacher/bass player,it is his job to get out there and try to interview them as well.He skims over the life changing events that take place in Kates world ie: the death of a parent,the birth of her only child, in just a couple of sentances without stopping to try and analyse the effect that this may have had on her music.Ahh yes,her music.Mr Jovanovic seems to very much to enjoy endlessly listing anyone that ever so much as broke wind in the studio over the last 30 years but seems less keen on on the albums themselves.They get an increasingly short shrift ending up with 'the Sensual World' and 'the Red Shoes'being described in a few sketchy paragraphs.I rather get the feeling that he is the kind of bloke that gets a bigger kick from arranging his cd's alphabetically rather than actually listening to them !.After finishing this disatisfying book,I am left wondering if a crushing lack of co-operation from the Bush camp left him with so little material to work with ?.If this was the case,surely this too could have been worked into the biography and provided an interesting angle in itself ?.What a wasted opportunity.
  Like many other people, I am a long-standing admirer of much of Kate's recorded work. She always brings a breath of fresh air to the music industry and her long-awaited new album has re-kindled my interest in her. I was therefore keen to read her bang-up-to-date biography.Whilst this book does cover Kate's musical career album-by-album, with the exception of her latest work, the book only stakes across Kate's personal life, leaving the reader with more questions than it answers. It is unfortunate that the author, Rob Jovanovic, was unable to secure an interview with Kate and therefore any material not already in the public domain has had to come from third parties. It would have been really interesting to have had more quotations directly attributable to Kate herself and this lack of direct contact with the book's subject is a bit of a let down, especially in relation to the last dozen years, of which little is known and which received scant cover.It would also have been nice to have more photographs, but that apart the book itself is beautifully packaged and presented.A worthy read for any Kate Bush fan; just don't expect any revalations.
  Even with limited resources (always a problem with Kate Bush, since she's so reluctant to participate in biographies) a good writer can create an enjoyable, absorbing work. Sadly, Rob Jovanovic cannot. The writing is amateurish, sub-fanzine style. Exclamation marks are used in the most embarrassing fashion; Abba are slagged off quite unnecessarily, as are other easy targets. Who wants to read for the umpteenth time that Stock, Aitken and Waterman's music is "drivel"? It's just too, too easy. A better writer could have written an arch, amusing remark about either of those two writing teams, where Jovanovic writes something insulting and prosaic.And this is before we get onto his assessment of Kate's life and work. Despite lengthy sections on some of the albums, it's obvious that Jovanovic is not a musician or musical. So we get flat, un-incisive commentaries about the albums. Apparently, "Never Be Mine" (from The Sensual World) and "Top of the City" (from The Red Shoes) are no good, but the author doesn't have a sufficient musical ear to tell us why he thinks this is the case.Read it by all means, it's not unenjoyable. It's just that it's no good.
  Like many people interested in music and popular culture Kate Bush has held a fascination for me from the earliest of her recordings. I kept the faith during her silent periods and was finally blown away by the majestic "Aerial" of last year. If it takes 11 years to produce a work of such genius then more musicians should consider taking their time. Jovanovic's book on Kate was a tantalising one. It was certainly a summary of the singer's career with a bit of insight into her creative process and the themes that had produced such a wide diversity of sound and lyric but I was ultimately left wanting. I needed to know more about what was going on in Kate's life during her Garbo years. Not one for gossip I didnt need to know about her personal life so much as maybe the music she listened to or the books she read to inspire such quantum leaps in her own output, I felt like a small boy being told which wall to peer over but in doing so saw little beyond Kate hanging out her washing or playing with Bertie. This book stops short of the arrival of Aerial was this because the author ran out of patience or was he filling in one of the many gaps in Kate's career. I would want to be generous and not consider that he might be "cashing in" on the new album.
  Kate Bush is hot news at the moment so I would imagine many people will be interested in this book . very detailed in the background to kates early career

 Kate Bush has written some of the most memorable songs in pop music history. Wuthering Heights, her debut single shot to number 1 in 1978 and she remains something of an enigma over a quarter of a century later. A singer, songwriter, musician, dancer, actress and director, Kate has inspired a devoted following around the world. Rob Jovanovic traces the story of Kate Bush's career, from her up-bringing in the Essex countryside through her first forays into music with a series of home recordings, to her number 1 debut album that propelled her to international stardom. Including exclusive interviews with studio musicians and choreographers, Jovanovic's biography emphasizes both her voracious talent and her intensely private personality. Over the last ten years, Kate Bush has taken time out from her hugely successful musical career to raise a family. In November 2005 however, she released Aerial, her first album in 12 years, to great critical acclaim.

       Written with fondness and filled with train-spotterish-details about recording sessions and musicians. The Times
       Rob Jovanovic has written about music for numerous magazines, including Mojo, Q, Level, Record Collector and Uncut, and many other publications such as The Guinness Rockopedia and The Rare Record Price Guide. He is a full-time music writer based in Nottingham.
  Everybody remembers what he was doing when he first heard "Wuthering Heights". I was about 18 at the time (she is a year older than I), it was winter and I looked the snow through the windows. Suddenly I heard a very strange sound coming from the radio. The song was amazing and I immediately loved it.... I really love the three first alben, very melodic. From "The Dreaming" and on, I love some and others less....To my knowledge there aren't many biographies written about Kate Bush. This book is interesting and one learns a lot about this artist. Chronologically shaped, we travel through the eighties,nineties until Aerial, her last album up today. Many topics are covered as the way she writes songs, produces them, the instruments she uses, her relationship with others artists and groups, her performances on stage with elaborate choreographies,....Kate Bush has fans accross a wide spectrum of society. She is the UK's greatest ever female songwriting talent and a very good-looking woman. She is a complicated person, just like everybody else. She likes the old-time comedian Will Hay as well as Captain Beefheart and supersoaps such as Dallas as much as the admires the surreal artist Salvator Dali. Quite a combination.This volume isn't trying to find any closeted skeletons, make any wide-of-the-mark accusation or reveal where her son goes to school. Here you will find a detailed look at her life and career. The author has spoken with a wide range of producers, engineers and musicians.Highly recommended for Kate's fans and curious who want to discover a very creative artist.
Kate Bush - The Biography by Rob Jovanovic is a worthy read, though the new biography  by Graeme Thomson "Under the Ivy" is far superior. Jovanovic's perspective is less in depth in comparison and, in my opinion, rather judgmental as opposed to Graeme's fair and impartial perspective. Jovanovic's personal distaste for "The Dreaming" was the tell tale sign of his inability to be impartial. Though "The Dreaming" didn't sell as well as some of her other albums and there were plenty of people who didn't "get it" , it is nevertheless, hailed by a multitude of critics as her masterpiece. Even Kate herself states that it is, by far, her favorite album.I guess I found his take on things to be a bit trite and amateurish. As a musician myself, I am interested in her musical compositions, their complexities, the deep seated meanings behind her songs and her amazing abilities to push boundaries and create that which has not been heard before. For me, Jovanovic reduced her to a mere pop star when , in fact, she's a musical genius capable of writing complex symphonies.She is in a category all her own, far from the juvenile leagues of Madonna, Brittainy and other similar pop starts who don't even write their own music. The fact that her music is like no other ( besides all the new groups now imitating her) is the very reason she deserves mass praise for she took us through the darkness to the light and back again in a way nobody preceding her had ever done. Yes, she was dramatic and dark and, at times, frightening, but that was what took us into the dream, if you will; what made us FEEL. Kate is all emotion and feeling. Those who don't allow themselves to feel in this way, would not understand nor enjoy the music due to their own external shell of protection.Read more ›
  I have not received this product as of yet but I wouldn't see a reason why I wouldn't like it.  I do love to read autobiographies about singers or stars.  I have always wanted to read about Kate Bush. I have just recently finished reading my Kate Bush autobiography book and I love it.  I do hope to buy some more books about Kate Bush in the future from Amazon.com.
  I really appreciate how quickly they got the book to me, though the author shed a few too many of his rather retarded opinions about Kate's music!  But I would rate this shipper as ab fab.
