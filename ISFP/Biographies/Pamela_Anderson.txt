Pamela Denise Anderson (born July 1, 1967)[2][3][4][5] is a Canadian-American actress. In addition to her acting career, she is also a model, producer, author, activist, and former showgirl, known for her roles on the television series Home Improvement, Baywatch, and V.I.P. She was chosen as a Playmate of the Month for Playboy magazine in February 1990.[6] For a time, she was known as Pamela Anderson Lee (or Pamela Lee) after marrying Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee. Anderson is a member of the animal rights movement and has conducted campaigns condemning the commercial fur industry and promoting veganism through the animal welfarist organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.[7] She maintains dual Canadian and American citizenship.[8]
Anderson was born in Ladysmith, British Columbia, the daughter of Barry, a furnace repairman, and Carol (née Grosco)[citation needed] Anderson, a waitress.[9] Her great-grandfather, Juho Hyytiäinen, was Finnish, a native of Saarijärvi, and left the Grand Duchy of Finland (which was a part of the Russian Empire at the time) in 1908.[10] He changed his name to Anderson when he arrived as an immigrant. Anderson also has Russian ancestry on her mother's side.[11]
Anderson got some press coverage right after her birth as the country's "Centennial Baby", having been the first baby born on July 1, 1967, the 100th anniversary of Canada's official founding via the Constitution Act, 1867.[12]
Anderson suffered frequent sexual abuse as a child, a fact she would not reveal publicly until 2014: she was molested by a female babysitter from ages 6 to 10, raped by a 25-year-old man when she was twelve, and gang raped by her boyfriend and six of his friends when she was 14. She also revealed that her father, though "loving", had been an alcoholic.[13]
Anderson attended Highland Secondary School in Comox, British Columbia. During high school, she played on the volleyball team.[14] She graduated in 1985.[12] In 1988, Anderson moved to Vancouver and worked as a fitness instructor.[12]
During the summer of 1989, Anderson went with friends to a BC Lions Canadian Football League game at BC Place in Vancouver, during which live video of her wearing a tightly-fitted Labatt's Beer t-shirt was shown on the stadium's huge video screen, causing an immense roar of approval from the crowd. As part of a PR event for the brewery, she was then escorted down to field level to wide applause. From that event, her photographer boyfriend Dan Ilicic produced a poster of his own called the Blue Zone Girl.[15]
In the aftermath of her sudden Vancouver celebrity, she appeared as the cover girl on Playboy magazine's October 1989 issue. At that point she decided to live in Los Angeles to further pursue her modeling career. Playboy subsequently chose her as Playmate of the Month in their February 1990 issue, in which she appeared in the centerfold photo. Anderson then elected to have breast implant surgery. Anderson has since appeared in Playboy several times in the 1990s and 2000s.
Anderson's Playboy career spans twenty-two years, including parts of four decades, (1989–2011), and she has appeared on more Playboy covers than anyone else.[16] She has also made appearances in the publication's newsstand specials. Anderson wrote the foreword in the Playboy coffee table book Playboy's Greatest Covers.
After she moved to Los Angeles, she won a minor role as the original "Tool Time girl" on the hit television sitcom, Home Improvement. She left the show after two seasons and won the role of C. J. Parker on Baywatch, a role she played between 1992 and 1998. Anderson was still modeling for Outdoor Life and appearing on the cover of the magazine each year. In 1993, Anderson appeared in a music video "Can't Have Your Cake" by Vince Neil to promote his first solo album Exposed.
In 1994, she was cast in her first starring film role, in Raw Justice, also known as Good Cop, Bad Cop, costarring with Stacy Keach, David Keith and Robert Hays. Under the alternate title, the film won the Bronze Award at the Worldfest-Charleston in the category for dramatic theatrical films.[citation needed]
In 1996, she appeared in Barb Wire playing Barbara Rose Kopetski, which was later claimed by some sources to be Anderson's real name, although it is not. The movie, a thinly veiled futuristic remake of Casablanca, was not a commercial success. In April 1997, she guest-hosted Saturday Night Live. She appeared on one of two covers for the September issue of Playboy.
In September 1998, Anderson starred as Vallery Irons in the Sony Pictures Entertainment syndicated show V.I.P. created by J. F. Lawton.[17] Blending action and humor in a fast-paced adventure series, with Anderson often poking fun at her tabloid image, the show explored the exciting and sometimes treacherous lives of the rich and famous.[18] The series lasted through a successful four-year run.[19] In 1999, she appeared as a giantess in the music video for "Miserable" by California alternative rock band Lit. Her role as C.J. Parker gave her more popularity and gained her attention from international viewers. She returned to Baywatch for the 2003 reunion movie, Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding. She appeared on The Nanny as Fran's rival, Heather Biblow.
In early 2004, Anderson returned to the spotlight. In May, she appeared naked on the cover of Playboy magazine. It was the first time she had appeared naked on any magazine cover. Later, she posed naked for Stuff and GQ magazines.

After this, she began touring the United States, signing autographs for fans at Wal-Mart stores nationwide. Her second book, the sequel Star Struck, released in 2005, is a thinly veiled look at her life with Tommy Lee and the trials of celebrity life. In April 2005, Anderson starred in a new Fox sitcom Stacked as Skyler Dayton, a party girl who goes to work at a bookstore. It was canceled on May 18, 2006, after two seasons, although some episodes were never aired.

In December 2009, Anderson guest-starred as Genie of the Lamp in the pantomime Aladdin at the New Wimbledon Theatre in Wimbledon, south-west London, England.[22][23] Anderson took over the role from comedienne Ruby Wax, with former EastEnders actress Anita Dobson and comedian Paul O'Grady also booked for the role.[24] In 2010, she appeared in the short film The Commuter directed by the McHenry Brothers and shot entirely on the Nokia N8 smartphone as promotion for the phone in the UK.[25][26]
During an appearance at the World Wrestling Federation's Royal Rumble in 1995, Anderson promised that she would accompany the winner of the Royal Rumble to WrestleMania. Anderson returned for her appearance at the World Wrestling Federation's WrestleMania XI on April 2, but as the guest valet for WWF World Heavyweight Champion Diesel and not the Royal Rumble winner, his opponent Shawn Michaels; Michaels ended up being accompanied to the ring by Jenny McCarthy. After pinning Michaels, Diesel left with both Anderson and McCarthy.
In anticipation of her appearance at the Royal Rumble, several skits were produced featuring wrestlers fawning over Anderson. One commercial featured Anderson coming home and checking her answering machine. As Anderson strips down behind a curtain, messages from wrestlers such as Shawn Michaels, Diesel, and Doink the Clown can be heard.
At the 2006 Canada's Walk of Fame induction ceremony, Anderson shared a kiss with WWE diva and fellow Canadian Trish Stratus.
She appeared on former Pro Wrestling commentator Mark Madden's Pittsburgh-based sports talk radio show in October 2006.
On July 9, 2008, Anderson entered the Australian Big Brother house for a three-day visit.[27] This was Anderson's first foray into reality television. In November 2010, Anderson appeared on season 4 of Bigg Boss, the Indian version of the Big Brother television franchise. She stayed as a guest in the house for three days for a reported sum of Rs. 2.5 crores (approx US$ 550,000).[28] Furthering her involvement in the franchise, In September 2011, Anderson took part in the 12th series of the UK version of Big Brother.[29] On September 9, 2012, it was officially announced that she will enter the House in Bulgaria on September 16, taking part in the fourth season of VIP Brother, which is the celebrity spin-off of Big Brother in Bulgaria.[30]

In 2013, Anderson appeared on series 8 of the British reality TV show Dancing on Ice, partnered with former winner Matt Evers.[36][37] They became the first couple on that series to be voted off by the judges due to a few stumbles.[38]
One of Anderson's campaigns as a member of PETA has been against the use of fur. In 1999, Anderson received the first Linda McCartney Memorial Award for animal rights protectors, in recognition of her campaign. In 2003, Anderson stripped down for PETA's "I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur" advertising campaign. On June 28, 2006, Anderson posed naked with other protesters on a window display of the Stella McCartney boutique in London, England. It was a PETA gala event before the PETA Humanitarian Awards. Anderson went inside the boutique and said she would take her clothes off if the event raised enough money for PETA, which it did. She campaigned against Kentucky Fried Chicken. In 2001, Anderson released a letter in support of PETA's campaign against Kentucky Fried Chicken, stating "What KFC does to 750 million chickens each year is not civilized or acceptable." She later made a video about KFC's treatment of chickens.[39] In January 2006, Anderson requested that the Governor of Kentucky remove a bust of Colonel Sanders, the founder of KFC, from display but her request was refused even when she offered her own bust in exchange. In February 2006, Anderson decided to boycott the Kentucky Derby because of its support for Kentucky Fried Chicken.
She has also campaigned against seal hunting in Canada. In March 2006, Anderson asked to speak to Prime Minister Stephen Harper about the annual seal hunt but was refused. In May 2006, she petitioned individuals on the street for their opinion on the Canadian Seal Hunt. In December 2009, Anderson, photographed in a t-shirt with a drawn picture of a seal pup on it, was featured in a new ad campaign for PETA. She appears next to the headline "Save the Seals" in the ad and urges the public to help end "Canada's annual seal slaughter." She joined forces with the organization again in a campaign for the boycott of fruit-juice maker POM. The "Pom Horrible Campaign"[40] has resulted in the company halting animal tests.
Anderson became the center of controversy when she posed in a bikini nearly nude for a PETA ad that was banned in Montreal, Canada on grounds that the ad was sexist. Anderson retorted saying, "In a city that is known for its exotic dancing and for being progressive and edgy, how sad that a woman would be banned from using her own body in a political protest over the suffering of cows and chickens. In some parts of the world, women are forced to cover their whole bodies with burqas – is that next? I didn't think that Canada would be so puritanical." [41]
She became a company spokesperson for FrogAds, Inc. in March 2012.[42] In February 2014, she stripped for a Valentine’s Day-themed ad for PETA, urging dog lovers to cuddle up with their pets during winter.[43]
In March 2005, Anderson became a spokesperson for MAC Cosmetics's MAC AIDS Fund, which helped people affected by AIDS and HIV. After becoming the official spokesmodel, Anderson raised money during events in Toronto, Tokyo, Dublin, and Athens. Anderson became the celebrity spokesperson for the American Liver Foundation, and served as the Grand Marshal of the SOS motorcycle ride fundraiser. She wrote an open letter to President Barack Obama urging the legalization of cannabis.[44]
In addition to her fame from modelling and acting, Anderson has received a great deal of press attention for her well-publicized personal life. Her relationships have made headlines in gossip magazines for years.
Anderson married Tommy Lee, drummer of Mötley Crüe, on February 19, 1995, after knowing him for 96 hours/4 days.[45] They wed on a beach, with Anderson in a bikini. Anderson's mother did not know, and learned of the marriage from People magazine. During this time, she was known professionally as Pamela Anderson Lee. Together they have two sons, Brandon Thomas Lee and Dylan Jagger Lee. Dylan Jagger Lee was named for Anderson's great grandfather, Dale Jagger Grosco who fought in World War II. The couple divorced in 1998. Although divorced, the couple reunited briefly upon Lee's release from prison but eventually split again in 2001. They reconciled and split again in 2008.[46]
In March 2002, Anderson publicly stated that she had contracted Hepatitis C from Lee (supposedly from sharing tattoo needles), and began writing a regular column for Jane magazine. In October 2003, Anderson jokingly said on Howard Stern's radio show that she does not expect to live more than 10 or 15 years,[47] but this was misconstrued and taken seriously by many websites and tabloids.
After the 1998 divorce, Anderson became engaged to the model Marcus Schenkenberg; they broke up in 2001. She then became engaged to the singer Kid Rock (Robert J. Ritchie); she broke up with him in 2003. On July 18, 2006, it was announced that she would marry Kid Rock on July 29, 2006, on a yacht near St Tropez, France. "Feels like I've been stuck in a time warp," said Anderson in her blog entry. "Not able to let go of MY family picture ... it's been sad and lonely and frustrating ... I've raised my kids alone in hope of a miracle. Well my miracle came and went. And came back and back because he knew that I'd wake up one day and realize that I was waiting for nothing." "I'm moving on," she declared. "I feel like I'm finally free ... I'm in love." There was extensive unconfirmed media speculation that the marriage was pregnancy-related, but the theory was based only on Anderson's representative's refusal to comment on the question.[48]
On November 10, 2006, it was announced that Anderson had miscarried while in Vancouver shooting a new film, Blonde and Blonder.[49] Seventeen days later, on November 27, 2006, Anderson filed for divorce in Los Angeles County Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences.[50] Some news reports have suggested that Kid Rock's outrage during a screening of Borat, in which Anderson plays a cameo role, led to the filing for divorce two weeks later.[51]
In September 2007, Anderson told talk show host Ellen DeGeneres that she was engaged. On September 29, Anderson and film producer Rick Salomon applied for a marriage license in Las Vegas.[52] On October 6, 2007, Anderson married Salomon in a small wedding ceremony at The Mirage, between her two nightly appearances at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in Hans Klok's magic show.[53] The couple separated on December 13, and on February 22, 2008, Anderson requested through the courts that the marriage be annulled, citing fraud.[54]
In February 2007, Anderson said that she still often had sex with Lee since their divorce.[55] In mid-2008 Lee said that they were going to try again to make things work together.[56]
In October 2013, Anderson said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that she and Salomon were "friends with benefits". In January 2014, she announced that she had remarried Salomon on an unspecified date.[57]
A sex tape of Anderson and Tommy Lee on their honeymoon was stolen from their home in 1995 and made a huge stir on the Internet. Anderson sued the video distribution company, Internet Entertainment Group. Ultimately, the Lees entered into a confidential settlement agreement with IEG. Thereafter, the company began making the tape available to subscribers to its web sites again, resulting in triple the normal traffic on the sites.[58]
Another tape, which was made before the Tommy Lee tape, involving Anderson and musician Bret Michaels from Poison, was later announced, and an abridged version of less than 60 seconds appeared on the internet. Frames of the video first appeared in Penthouse magazine in March 1998. The tape was successfully blocked by Michaels, but a four-minute sex tape is still available on the Internet.
Anderson is a vegan, an advocate for animal rights, and an active member of the animal protection organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), taking part in several campaigns for animal rights.[59][60] She became a vegetarian in her early teens when she saw her father cleaning an animal he had hunted.[61]
The California Franchise Tax Board cited Anderson as delinquent in state income taxes owing nearly $525,000, in a list of Top 500 Delinquent Taxpayers,[63] updated on April 12, 2012. The tax board had filed a lien against Anderson on April 7, 2009.
Newman House is a pop architecture building constructed in 2003 in St Kilda, Victoria, Australia, which features a large image of Anderson's face. Sam Newman commissioned local architect Cassandra Fahey to design the building, and used the image with Anderson's permission. Permits were issued retroactively when it became a major local landmark and won the award for Best New Residential Building in the RAIA Victorian Architecture Awards.[64]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          A native of Canada, Pamela Denise Anderson was born in Ladysmith, British Columbia and later moved to the city of Vancouver. It was while she was attending a British Columbia Lions football game that Anderson was "discovered" in a most unusual way. Dressed in a Labatt's Beer T-shirt, her image was transmitted on the stadium's widescreen. The fans cheered the beautiful girl, and she was brought down to the 50-yard line and introduced to the appreciative crowd. As a result, she was signed to a commercial contract with Labatt's and became the company's Blue Zone girl. The campaign was so popular that other commercials and advertising assignments for Anderson soon followed. Due to the recognition from these commercials, she was soon approached to do her first cover for Playboy Magazine. Pamela has since gone on to grace the cover again an astounding five times, more than any other woman in the magazine's history.With the success and recognition she garnered from Playboy, Anderson soon moved to Los Angeles, California where she spent two seasons in the top-ten ABC-TV situation comedy Home Improvement (1991), as Lisa, the Tool Time Girl. It was on "Home Improvement" that she captured the attention and affection of viewing audiences, nationwide. At the same time, Anderson was cast as C.J. Parker on the internationally successful series Baywatch (1989), but because of the impossible scheduling requirements of working on two series, she eventually left "Home Improvement" and remained full-time on "Baywatch". She now stars on one of the most phenomenally popular television programs of all time, which is seen in 140 countries, worldwide. Recently, Anderson made the transition into the feature film arena, starring in Dark Horse Entertainment's action comedy Barb Wire (1996). In addition, Anderson was featured in the CBS movie-of-the-week Come Die with Me: A Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer Mystery (1994), a hip and updated Mike Hammer mystery, co-starring Rob Estes.Pamela was married to Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, and they had two children, Brandon and Dylan. However, the couple divorced in early 1998. Both have had a rocky relationship in the past and continued to date on and off, but then headed to court over custody of their two sons. Meanwhile, she starred in and produced her television series V.I.P. (1998), which ran for four seasons until 2002. During the spring of 2001, she dated singer Kid Rock, but they broke up in the fall of 2003. Eventually, she reunited with ex-husband Tommy Lee after she found out she was diagnosed with hepatitis C, which she contracted when they shared the same needle for their tattoo.

      Making love in the morning got me through morning sickness. I found I could be happy and throw up at the same time.
      What I know in life runs the gamut of the "feminist experience." The true meaning of feminism is this: to use your strong womanly image to gain strong results in society.
      I don't really think about anything too much. I live in the present. I move on. I don't think about what happened yesterday. If I think too much, it kind of freaks me out ...
      I don't recommend surgery at all. Women's bodies are beautiful as they are, and I've had a love/hate relationship with my breasts my whole life.quoted by the New York Post
      My doctor says, "You have hepatitis C". And I go, "Okay, how do I get rid of it?" And he's like, "You can't. This is what you're going to die from". I was in the middle of shooting V.I.P. (1998); I didn't know what to do. This wash came over my body. And then the doctor says, "Do you know how you got it?" I said no. And he said, "Your husband never told you he had it?" It kind of threw me for a while. Obviously, it's a hard thing to tell someone, but I wish he could have had the nerve to tell me. Obviously, his ego was more important than my life.
      It's terrible because people see stars like JLo and Beyoncé wearing fur and they don't think about the cruelty that goes into it.

=======================================================
The quintessential "Baywatch Babe" made the shift from the small to the big screen with limited success, in a series of underpowered celebrity vehicles.
Instead, she is destined to be remembered for her pneumatic, surgically-enhanced chest, volatile on-off relationship with rocker Tommy Lee, and headline-grabbing antics.Feature-length outings, so to speak, include the wannabe thriller 'Snapdragon', the vacuous action caper 'Raw Justice' and 'Naked Justice'.Movies unlikely to trouble the sleep of the likes of Dame Judi Dench, the publicity tagline for the latter promised: "She's about to bear her soul...and all that goes with it."It was while she attended a British Columbia Lions football game that she was "discovered" in a most unusual way. Dressed in a Labatt's Beer T-shirt, her image was transmitted on the stadium's wide screen to the crowd's appreciation and a contract to sell the beer quickly followed.It wasn't long before Playboy magazine expressed an interest and there followed the first of 12 covers featuring Pamela Anderson naked. TV then picked up on the blonde (actually, she's a brunette) and she joined the cast of the series 'Home Improvement'.At the same time, she accepted the part that was to launch her into the celebrity stratosphere - buoyancy-aid packing lifeguard, CJ Parker, in 'Baywatch'.Milking her newfound celebrity, she was also featured in a number of tacky spin-offs including videos such as 'Wet & Wild III', 'Sexy Lingerie II' and 'Wrestlemania IX'.However, off screen things weren't going quite so smoothly following her marriage to Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee in 1995.First of all a "honeymoon" video of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee engaged in sex on a yacht made its way onto the internet.Three years later Anderson was filing for divorce, after her husband was jailed for six months for assault (although the couple were briefly reunited when she tried to help him with his alcohol problem).In 1999 she had her breast implants removed, ditched Lee for good and hooked up with Swedish model Marcus Schenkenberg, and latterly Kid Rock.In 1996, she had made her highest profile big screen appearance, in the disposable 'Barb Wire', which was a hit with hardcore fans, and also had an uncredited cameo in 2002's live action 'Scooby Doo'.The same year she announced she had contracted hepatitis C after sharing a dirty needle with ex-husband Tommy Lee and was receiving treatment. She returned to the beach for 'Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding' and also played Becca in the horror spoof sequel, 'Scary Movie 3'.
2004 was a busy year for Anderson. She posed naked on the cover of Playboy magazine and became a naturalised citizen of the US. That same year, Anderson published the book 'Star', which she co-wrote with Eric Shaw Quinn. The book follows the trials and tribulations of a teenager trying to make it in the world of showbiz. She completed a tour to promote the book and went on to pen a sequel the following year.
In 2005, Anderson made a return to the small screen, starring in the sitcom 'Stacked'. However, the show was cancelled after just two seasons.
The model and actress was honoured in 2006 when she received a star on Canada's Walk of Fame. She went on to host Canada's Juno Awards later that year.
In 2008, Anderson dipped a toe in the pool of reality television, appearing on Australia's 'Big Brother' show and starring in her own series 'Pam: Girl on the Loose'.
Anderson appeared in the US show 'Dancing with the Stars' in 2010, coming sixth overall in the contest.
