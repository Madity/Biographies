John Joseph Travolta (born February 18, 1954) is an American actor, dancer, and singer. Travolta first became known in the 1970s, after appearing on the television series Welcome Back, Kotter and starring in the box office successes Saturday Night Fever and Grease. Travolta's acting career declined through the 1980s. His career enjoyed a resurgence in the 1990s with his role in Pulp Fiction, and he has since continued starring in more recent films such as Face/Off, Ladder 49, and Wild Hogs. Travolta was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for Saturday Night Fever and Pulp Fiction. He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his performance in Get Shorty.
Travolta, the youngest of six children,[2] was born and raised in Englewood, New Jersey, an inner-ring suburb of New York City. His father, Salvatore Travolta (November 1912 – May 1995),[3] was a semi-professional American football player turned tire salesman and partner in a tire company.[4] His mother, Helen Cecilia (née Burke, January 1912 – December 1978),[3] was an actress and singer who had appeared in The Sunshine Sisters, a radio vocal group, and acted and directed before becoming a high school drama and English teacher.[5] His siblings, Joey, Ellen, Ann, Margaret, and Sam Travolta, have all acted.[5] His father was a second-generation Italian American and his mother was Irish American;[6][7] he grew up in an Irish-American neighborhood and has said that his household was predominantly Irish in culture.[8][9] He was raised Roman Catholic, but converted to Scientology in 1975.[7][10] Travolta attended Dwight Morrow High School, but dropped out as a junior at age 17 in 1971.[11]
After attending Dwight Morrow High School,[12] Travolta moved across the Hudson River to New York City and landed a role in the touring company of the musical Grease and on Broadway in Over Here!, singing the Sherman Brothers' song "Dream Drummin'".[13][14] He then moved to Los Angeles to further his career in show business.
Travolta's first California-filmed television role was as a fall victim in, Emergency! (S2E2), in September 1972,[15] but his first significant movie role was as Billy Nolan, a bully who was goaded into playing a prank on Sissy Spacek's character in the horror film, Carrie (1976).[16] Around the same time, he landed his star-making role as Vinnie Barbarino in the TV sitcom Welcome Back, Kotter (1975–1979), in which his sister, Ellen, also occasionally appeared (as Arnold Horshack's mother).[17] The show aired on ABC.
Travolta had a hit single entitled "Let Her In", peaking at number ten on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in July 1976.[18][19][20] In the next few years, he appeared in two of his most noted screen roles: Tony Manero in Saturday Night Fever (1977) and as Danny Zuko in Grease (1978).[5] The films were among the most commercially successful pictures of the decade and catapulted Travolta to international stardom.[21] Saturday Night Fever earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.[22] At age 24, Travolta became one of the youngest performers ever nominated for the Best Actor Oscar.[23] His mother and his sister Ann appeared as extras in Saturday Night Fever and his sister Ellen appeared as a waitress in Grease. Travolta performed several of the songs on the Grease soundtrack album.[24] In 1980, Travolta inspired a nationwide country music craze that followed on the heels of his hit film, Urban Cowboy, in which he starred with Debra Winger.[25]
After Urban Cowboy, Travolta starred in a series of financial and critical failures that sidelined his acting career. These included Perfect, co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis, and Two of a Kind, a romantic comedy reteaming him with Olivia Newton-John. During that time he was offered, but turned down, lead roles in what would become box office hits, including American Gigolo[26] and An Officer and a Gentleman, both of which went to Richard Gere.[27]
In 1989, Travolta starred with Kirstie Alley in Look Who's Talking, which grossed $297,000,000, making it his most successful film since Grease. Travolta continued to the two sequels Look Who's Talking Too (1990) and Look Who's Talking Now (1993). But it was not until he played Vincent Vega in Quentin Tarantino's hit Pulp Fiction (1994), for which he received an Academy Award nomination, that his career revived.[5][28][29] The movie shifted him back onto the A-list, and he was inundated with offers. Notable roles following Pulp Fiction include a movie-buff loan shark in Get Shorty (1995), an FBI agent and terrorist in Face/Off (1997), a desperate attorney in A Civil Action (1998), a Bill Clinton-esque presidential candidate in Primary Colors (1998),[5] and a military investigator in The General's Daughter (1999).
Travolta also starred in Battlefield Earth (2000) based on a work of science fiction by L. Ron Hubbard, in which he played the leader of a group of aliens that enslaves humanity on a bleak future Earth. The film received almost universally negative reviews and did very poorly at the box office.[30] In 2007 he starred in Wild Hogs and played Mrs. Edna Turnblad in the remake of Hairspray, his first musical since Grease.[31] In 2008 he lent his voice for the film Bolt, in which he played the title role. Similarly, he is to play the voice of Gummy Bear in the animated film release scheduled for late 2015, "Gummy Bear The Movie 3D", a film that may be noted more for its associated merchandise revenues.

Travolta was in a relationship with actress Diana Hyland, whom he met while filming The Boy in the Plastic Bubble; Hyland died of breast cancer in 1977.[32]
Travolta married actress Kelly Preston in 1991. The couple had a son, Jett (April 13, 1992 – January 2, 2009).[33] Their daughter, Ella Bleu, was born in 2000 and a third child, a son named Benjamin, was born on November 23, 2010 in Florida.[34] Travolta and Preston have regularly attended marriage counseling; Travolta has stated that therapy has helped the marriage.[35]
In May 2012, an anonymous masseur filed a lawsuit against Travolta citing claims of sexual assault and battery. A lawyer for Travolta said that the allegations were "complete fiction and fabrication" and someone wanting their 15 minutes of fame. Travolta's counsel also stated that his client would be able to prove that he was not in California on the day in question and asserted that Travolta would "sue the attorney and Plaintiff for malicious prosecution" after getting the case thrown out.[36] A second masseur later joined the lawsuit making similar claims.[37][38] Both lawsuits were subsequently dropped by the complainants and dismissed without prejudice.[39]
A judge ruled to dismiss a defamation lawsuit against Travolta and his attorney Marty Singer by writer Robert Randolph. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Malcolm Mackey dismissed the case on September 27, 2012, because he found that a letter, written by Singer in response to allegations in a book by Randolph, had free speech protection.[40]
In 2009, Travolta's son, Jett, died while on a Christmas vacation in The Bahamas.[41][42] A Bahamian death certificate was issued, attributing the cause of death to a seizure.[43] Jett, who had a troubled history of seizures, reportedly suffered from Kawasaki disease at the age of two.[44][45] Travolta confirmed speculation that his son had autism and suffered regular seizures and immediately made his public statements while giving testimony after a multi-million dollar extortion plot against him in connection to his son's death.[46] After a mistrial, Travolta dropped the charges and has credited his immediate family and faith in helping him survive the premature death of his son and in moving forward with his film career.[47][48][49]
Travolta has been a practitioner of Scientology since 1975 when he was given the book Dianetics while filming the movie The Devil’s Rain in Durango, Mexico.[50] After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, joining other celebrities in helping with the relief efforts, Travolta flew his 707 full of supplies, doctors, and Scientologist Volunteer Ministers into the disaster area.[51]
Travolta is a certified private pilot.[citation needed] He owns five aircraft, including an ex-Qantas Boeing 707–138 airliner that bears the name Jett Clipper Ella in honor of his children.[52] Pan American World Airways was a large operator of the Boeing 707 and used Clipper in its names. The 707 aircraft bears the marks of Qantas, as Travolta acts as an official goodwill ambassador for the airline wherever he flies.[53]
His $4.9 million estate in the Jumbolair subdivision in Ocala, Florida, is situated on Greystone Airport with its own runway and taxiway right to his front door.[54]
On November 24, 1992, Travolta was piloting his Gulfstream N728T at night above a solid undercast, when he experienced a total electrical system failure, while flying under instrument flight rules into Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. During the emergency landing, he almost had a mid-air collision with a USAir Boeing 727, an event attributed to a risky decision by an air traffic controller.[55]
On September 13, 2010, during the first episode of the final season of her talk show, Oprah Winfrey announced that she would be taking her entire studio audience on an 8-day expenses-paid trip to Australia, with Travolta serving as pilot for the trip. He had helped Winfrey plan the trip for more than a year.[56]
He is the author of the book Propeller One-Way Night Coach, the story of the young Jeff’s first flight.[57]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          John Travolta first gained fame as the swaggering Vinnie Barbarino on the television series Welcome Back, Kotter (1975). In 1977, he parlayed his teeny-bopper fame into a big-screen career with the disco blockbuster Saturday Night Fever (1977). He languished in light dramas and television movies in the 1980s, but started a comeback in 1989 with Look Who's Talking (1989). He further resuscitated his career with an Oscar nomination for his role as a heavyset sympathetic hitman in Pulp Fiction (1994) in 1994.
          One of six children born to Helen Travolta and Salvatore Travolta, John Travolta grew up in Englewood, New Jersey. His father owned a tire repair shop called Travolta Tires in Hillsdale, NJ. Travolta appeared in a local production of "Who'll Save the Plowboy?". His mother enrolled him in a drama school in New York, where he studied voice, dancing and acting. He decided to combine all three of these skills and become a musical comedy performer. At 16 he landed his first professional job in a summer stock production of the musical "Bye Bye Birdie". He quit school at 16 and moved to New York, and worked regularly in summer stock and on television commercials. When work became scarce in New York, he went to Hollywood and appeared in minor roles in several series. A role in the national touring company of the hit 1950s musical "Grease" brought him back to New York. An opening in the New York production of "Grease" gave him his first Broadway role at age 18. After "Grease", he became a member of the company of the Broadway show "Over Here", which starred The Andrews Sisters. After ten months in "Over Here", he decided to try Hollywood once again. Once back in Hollywood, he had little trouble getting roles in numerous television shows. He was seen on The Rookies (1972), Emergency! (1972) and Medical Center (1969) and also made a movie, The Devil's Rain (1975), which was shot in New Mexico. The day he returned to Hollywood from New Mexico, he was called to an audition for a new situation comedy series ABC was planning to produce called Welcome Back, Kotter (1975). He got the part of Vinnie Barbarino and the series went on the air during the 1975 fall season. The rest, as they say, is history.

      [on his role in Carrie (1976)]: I wanted to work with Brian De Palma. I knew the film would be interesting and attract a lot of attention.
      "I have fame on the level of a Marilyn Monroe or an Elvis Presley, but part of the reason I didn't go the way they did was because of my beliefs. People make judgments about Scientology, but often they don't know what they're talking about".
      There is nothing gay in this movie (Hairspray (2007)). I'm not playing a gay man. Scientology is not homophobic in any way. In fact, it's one of the more tolerant faiths. Anyone's accepted.
      When they asked me to be Edna Turnblad I said, 'Gee, 32 years as a leading man -- why me? What makes you think I'd be the perfect woman?'
      As you get older you have to force yourself to have new dreams. For instance, I've been flying for 37 years but now teaching others to fly is interesting for me. Sometimes you have to find new angles on life to keep you interested, like sharing successes and inspiring and helping others. You have to go out of your way to activate your dreams and keep them going in this third chapter of your life.
      [of his role as Edna in Hairspray (2007)] It was tough dancing in high heels, but we did change the heels to more of a dance shoe - like a Capezio. You know they kept giving me these skinny high heels and it's like, 'Okay, I understand those. My mother wore those.' However, when I was growing up and I saw girls in the chorus, they had a thicker heel and it was a dance shoe and I kept telling them to find those shoes. I knew they existed, and finally they brought out a shoe and I said, 'That's the shoe! Now make it in many colors'.
      [on Saturday Night Fever (1977):] I love being regarded as a sex symbol, but I can't take it too seriously.
      [on how the late James Gandolfini consoled him after the death of his son] James went out of his way to come to Florida and he would not leave Florida until I was okay, or he felt that I would be fine. After a week I said, 'Jim you can really, you can, you know, we'll be fine. I've got a lot of support here.' But the idea that in our profession someone would go out of their way and not want to leave you until he felt you were okay, that's the kind of soul that James Gandolfini was. My father sold tires to his father. I was his inspiration to get into the business. He would see pictures of me on the wall from movies and he decided that he wanted to be an actor. He was a people person first and then everything else. He was this beautiful man and I love him very much.
      [on being cast in Pulp Fiction (1994)] There was a rumor that a young new director who had directed a film called Reservoir Dogs (1992) was quite interested in working with me. And his name was Quentin Tarantino. I said, "Sounds good. He's talented. I saw the movie. I would love to meet him, too." After six or seven hours of hanging out, he verbally presented two ideas to me. One was the vampire movie From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) and the other one was Pulp Fiction. I responded to Pulp Fiction but I didn't respond to From Dusk Till Dawn, and he noticed that. So at the end of the meeting he said, "I'm curious. You seem to like the 'Pulp Fiction' one, but you did not respond as much to the other." I said, "Well, it's simple, Quentin. I'm just not a vampire guy."
      To be honest, I thought "Pulp" would have the same fate as Reservoir Dogs (1992), meaning it would be an art house movie that would have a smaller audience. I never thought it would have a mainstream audience; I thought it was too unique of a movie to hit a commercial note. And when it did, it surprised all of us, I think, because we were going to be fine with it having the same success as Reservoir Dogs. But that it would become Forrest Gump (1994) was a whole other idea.
      [on dancing with Princess Diana at the White House in 1985] There really was something lovely and girlish about her and I felt that I had taken her back to her childhood when she had probably watched Grease (1978) and for that moment I was her Prince Charming.
      [on his plans for after the 2014 Oscars ceremony] I don't drink very much, but I wait until Oscar night to have my drinks. So now I'm ready to stay out until five in the morning. We're gonna do Vanity Fair, then we're gonna do Madonna's party, and we're gonna have fun tonight. I'm not gonna be happy until we see the sun rise.
=======================================================
Saturday Night Fever and Grease made him a 70s icon, but suddenly his career stopped dead - until a decade later when Tarantino cast him in Pulp Fiction.
John Joseph Travolta was born to catholic parents. His Irish/American mother, Helen Cecilia Burke, was a singer and actress who went on to become a school drama teacher – she gave birth to Travolta at the age of 42; his father Salvatore Travolta, a second generation Italian/American, was a semi-professional football player before becoming a tire salesman.
Sharing their home was five of Travolta’s siblings. Most of the family were performers: not only was his mother, his brothers and sisters, Joey, Sam Ellen, Ann and Margaret all have gone on to work in TV, film and music too. Encouraged by both parents - their dad would set up a mini theatre in their basement as a place for them to perform.
Around the same time Travolta became interested with aviation, as he would often see-off his mother and sister at the airport, who were flying off for a performance. He read up on aviation and if the young Travolta wasn’t in his home-made theatre, he could be found in his backyard with girls he had persuaded to wear their Brownie uniforms and play flight attendants whilst he captained his make-believe airplane.
Travolta was musical as well - he loved listening to it, mainly the Beatles and learned to play the guitar. He won a dance competition doing the twist - he went on to take up tap dancing and was lucky enough to be taught by Gene Kelly’s brother.
At the age of 12, Travolta joined a drama workshop. Helen later enrolled him in a New York Drama School, where he studied acting and dancing. He later won a role in a local production of ‘Who’ll Save The Plowboy?’
Not content with his new place at the Dwight Morrow Drama School, age 16 he dropped out and moved to New York City where he lived with his sister Ann. Soon afterwards he appeared in a number of TV commercials and local summer stock productions. His first professional acting role was in a musical comedy: ‘Bye Bye Birdie’ (1970).
Acting became hard to come by in New York, so Travolta went to Hollywood but his acting career never took off. So, aged 18, Travolta returned to New York and eventually won a role on Broadway in a musical set in the 1950s ‘Grease’ – playing Doody. Later that year, he played in the Broadway show “Over Here” with The Andrews Sisters and went on to tour with the show. He was then cast in minor roles in the TV shows ‘Kids’ and ‘Emergency’.
In these early years, Travolta spent most of his money on flying lessons – he is now qualified to fly a number of different planes including a Boeing 707 airliner.
In 1975, Travolta won his first major part that lasted four years in the sitcom ‘Welcome Back Kotter’ - this catapulted him into the limelight and captured the hearts of teenage girls across the US after playing lippy teenage delinquent Vinnie Barbarino. His sister Ellen occasionally appeared in the show too.
Travolta took advantage of his TV profile and his love of music and recorded hit single ‘Let Her In’ which charted at number 10 in the American - the album reached the top 20.
Now aged 20, Travolta was cast his first big film ‘Carrie’ (1976), where he played a school bully who taunted Sissy Spacek’s title character who had telekinetic powers – one night she was pushed too far causing a bloody disaster!
The same year Travolta took on the role of an immune deficient boy in TV movie ‘The Boy in the Plastic Bubble’ (1976). Whilst filming he fell in love with his co-star, Diana Hyland, who 18 years his senior, played his mother. Sadly Hyland was later diagnosed with cancer and died in his arms in 1977.
Travolta's next role saw him hit the dancefloor in ‘Saturday Night Fever’ (1977) playing Tony Manero and disco dancing to the legendary Bee Gees soundtrack. To prepare for the role Travolta took nine months of dance lessons. He was rewarded with his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role.
Like one of his many aircrafts, Travolta was riding high on the pronominal success of his last project; he coupled his love of acting with his penchant for a song and played Danny, the male lead, a warbling womanising teenager in ‘Grease’ (1978). Danny’s love interest was female lead, Australian actress/singer Olivier Newton-John as Sandy. Cinema queues were bigger than ever: the film and its sound track became a massive hit: Grease the album sold over 10 million copies and gave Travolta another shot at being a pop star; the film went on to be one of the most successful musicals of all time.
The hit, ‘Urban Cowboy’ (1980) was Travolta’s next film playing a country boy who had moved to the city and fell in love with Debra Winger’s character. The film was nominated for two Golden Globe awards and inspired a country music craze across America.
Unfortunately Travolta’s career took a nose dive after this. He actually turned down the lead role in ‘American Gigolo’ (1980), with the role going to Richard Gere instead. He also turned down Gere’s part in ‘An Officer and a Gentleman’ (1982), Tom Hanks’ part in ‘Splash’ (1984) and Michael Douglas’ part in ‘Fatal Attraction’ (1987).
Travolta did go on to say “yes” and agreed to reprise his old disco dancing character Tony Manero in the sequel to Saturday Night Fever, ‘Staying Alive’ (1983) - directed by Sylvester Stallone and it proved just as successful as its predecessor.
That same year, Travolta teamed up again with Grease co-star Olivia Newton-John in ‘Two of a Kind’ (1983), a romantic comedy where the pair sang together again on the soundtrack. Two years on he was strutting his stuff in Jamie Lee Curtis’ aerobics class in ‘Perfect’ (1983).
Travolta maintained a low profile until 1989 when he made a brief comeback in the hit comedy ‘Look Who’s Talking’ (1989) alongside Kirstie Alley. He went on to appear in both sequels.
That same year Travolta starred in ‘The Experts’ (1989) where he met his wife, actress Kelly Preston. Travolta and Preston eventually married on 5th September 1991 by a scientologist minister – however this marriage was declared illegal so they married again in accordance with the law.
Travolta’s career was relatively low key until 1994, when he returned to the big screen in Quentin Tarrantino’s hit ‘Pulp Fiction’ (1994). He worked alongside Samuel L. Jackson as part of a hit-man duo playing foul mouthed Vincent Vega. Travolta earned his second Academy Award nomination, $140,000 salary as well as a revived career.
During the following years Travolta gained more success in films ‘Get Shorty’ (1995) which won him an American Comedy Award for Funniest Actor in a Motion Picture (leading role) and a pay-check of $3.5m; ‘Broken Arrow’ (1996) another $7m; ‘Phenomenon’ (1996) $8m, and ‘Michael’ (1996) putting a cool $10m in the bank.
Travolta went on to play a convict who swapped faces with Nicholas Cage in the hit action flick ‘Face/Off’ (1997) and received a $15m salary. He went on to play US Governor Jack Stanton in ‘Primary Colors’ (1998) for an $18m fee, staring alongside Emma Thompson. He gained a hefty 30 pounds to play the part.
After ‘Primary Colors’ the offers came flooding in. Later on in 1998 Travolta appeared alongside talents such as George Clooney (who incidentally dated his wife Kelly before she met Travolta - she gave Clooney his pet pig) and John Cusack in war drama, ‘The Thin Red Line’ (1998) which scoop a massive seven Academy Award nominations and then as a lawyer in ‘A Civil Action’ (1989) $20m, and ‘The General’s Daughter’ (1999) for the same salary.
During the 90s, Travolta’s biggest pay-checks for his films totalled well over $121m – so enough to finance his expensive taste in airplanes and flying them. Going into the new millennium he continued to command the same sized payments.
A New Year and a new genre in the multi-million dollar futuristic sci-fi flick ‘Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000 (2000). When the book was first written, Travolta was keen to turn it into a film, but no studio would back its production – it proved to be a massive flop and failed to make any profit.
Over the next few years, Travolta seem to pick the wrong type of films. Lucky Numbers (2000) alongside Friends star Lisa Kudrow barely even made an appearance in UK cinemas, ‘Swordfish’ (2001) faired a little better.
For a change Travolta played a nice guy in ‘Domestic Disturbance’ (2001) leaving the nasty role to Vince Vaughn. He returned to a bad guy in Marvel Comic’s big screen version of ‘The Punisher’ (2004).
Later in the year, Travolta played an alcoholic English professor in ‘A Love Song For Bobby Long’ (2004) where his image was dramatically changed with short white hair. He stayed in the drama genre for his next big screen outing as a fire sergeant in ‘Ladder 49’ (2004) playing Captain Mike.
The following year Travolta reprised his role as Chilli Palmer in ‘Be Cool’ (2005), the sequel to 1995’s hit ‘Get Shorty’. Once again he teamed up with his original co-stars Rene Russo and Danny DeVito and was also reunited with his Pulp Fiction co-star Uma Thurman. That year he was also seen in crime thriller ‘Lonely Hearts’ (2006).
Travolta’s career is still going strong and he can be seen clad in leather as a middle aged biker, desperate to regain his youth, in the comedy ‘Wild Hogs’ (2007) with comedians Martin Lawrence and Tim Allen.
Aside from his acting, Travolta is very much a family man who adores his wife and children. His private life took a tragic turn in January 2009 when his son, Jett (who suffered from Kawasaki Syndrome) died while the family were on holiday in the Bahamas. It was later revealed that Jett was autistic and had a history of suffering from seizures.
Travolta seems to have many talents, he is a FAA licensed pilot and owns a staggering 5 airplanes which includes an ex-Australian airliner The Quantus 707-138; its named Jett Clipper Ella after his kids. Travolta is a goodwill Ambassador for the airline Pan Am which was an operator of the 707. His home in Florida is situated in Greystone Airport and has its own handy runway.
Travolta wrote and illustrated a short children’s book in 1992 with the title Propeller One Way Night Coach about a young boy who travelled across America in the 1950s.
2007 is the year that Travolta swapped sex when he played mother Edna Turnblad in the remake of John Waters’ film ‘Hairspray’ (1988). Edna’s pleasantly plump daughter gains fame from a local dancing contest on TV. ‘Hairspray’ (2007) has a star-studded cast including Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, Jerry Stiller and Queen Latifah. Set in the 60s with great music and big hair.
In 2009 Travolta starred in a remake of the 70's classic, 'The Taking of Pelham 123' with Denzel Washington and the same year starred alongside Robin Williams in the comedy 'Old Dogs'. The movie was a real family affair, as Travolta's wife Kelly and daughter Ella Bleu also had starring roles.
A loving father and husband, dancer, singer, actor and licensed pilot – Travolta’s career is still going strong. And in May 2010 the Travoltas announced that they are expecting their third child.

Born February 18, 1954, in Englewood, John Travolta was the youngest of six children in a family of entertainers; all but one of his siblings pursued showbusiness careers as well. By the age of 12 Travolta himself had already joined an area actors' group, and soon began appearing in local musicals and dinner-theater performances. By age 16, he dropped out of high school to take up acting full-time, relocating to Manhattan to make his off-Broadway debut in 1972 in Rain, and a minor role in the touring company of the hit musical Grease followed. In 1975, Travolta was cast in an ABC sitcom entitled Welcome Back, Kotter. As Vinnie Barbarino, a dim-witted high school Lothario, he shot to overnight superstardom, and his face instantly adorned T-shirts and lunch boxes. Before the first episode of the series even aired, he also won a small role in Brian De Palma's 1976 horror picture Carrie, and at the early peak of his Kotter success he even recorded a series of pop music LPs -- {^Can't Let Go}, {^John Travolta}, and {^Travolta Fever} -- scoring a major hit with the single "Let Her In." Approached with a role in Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven, he was forced to reject the project in the face of a busy Kotter schedule, but in 1976 he was able to shoot a TV feature, director Randal Kleiser's The Boy in the Plastic Bubble, which won considerable critical acclaim. Diana Hyland, the actress who played Travolta's mother in the picture, also became his offscreen lover until her death from cancer in 1977. In the wake of Hyland's death, Travolta's first major feature film, John Badham's Saturday Night Fever (1977), emerged in the fall of that year. A latter-day Rebel Without a Cause set against the backdrop of the New York City disco nightlife, it positioned Travolta as the most talked-about young star in Hollywood. In addition to earning his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, he also became an icon of the era, his white-suited visage and cocky, rhythmic strut enduring as defining images of late-'70s American culture. In 1978, he starred in Kleiser's film adaptation of Grease, this time essaying the lead role of 1950s greaser Danny Zuko. Its box-office success was even greater than Saturday Night Fever's, becoming a perennial fan favorite and, like its predecessor, spawning a massively popular soundtrack LP. In the light of his back-to-back successes, as well as the continued popularity of Welcome Back, Kotter -- on which he still occasionally appeared -- it seemed Travolta could do no wrong - but things wouldn't always be so rosy for the performer.Travolta's first misstep was 1978's Moment By Moment, a laughable May-December romance with Lily Tomlin. He then reprised the role of Tony Manero in the Saturday Night Fever sequel Staying Alive. Directed by Sylvester Stallone as a kind of Rocky retread, the film was released in 1983 to embarrassing returns and horrendous reviews. It would prove to be just one in a string of '80s stinkers for the actor, followed by disappointments like Two of a Kind, Perfect, and The Experts. He made a minor comeback with 1989's Look Who's Talking, which fared well at the box office, but the movie did little for Travolta's reputation, and the performer was all but completely washed up by the beginning of the '90s. Then, in 1994, Travolta made one of the most stunning comebacks in entertainment history by starring in Pulp Fiction, a lavishly acclaimed crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, a longtime Travolta fan who wrote the role of Vincent Vega specifically with the actor in mind; Travolta reportedly waived his salary to play the role. A critical as well as commercial smash, Pulp Fiction introduced Travolta to a new generation of moviegoers, and suddenly he was again a major star who could command a massive salary, with a second Academy Award nomination to prove it. In the wake of Pulp Fiction, the resurrected Travolta became one of the hardest-working actors in Hollywood, and on Tarantino's advice he accepted the starring role in director Barry Sonnenfeld's 1995 Elmore Leonard adaptation Get Shorty. Acclaimed by many critics as his finest performance to date, it was another major hit, and he followed it by appearing in the 1996 John Woo action tale Broken Arrow. Phenomenon was another smash that same summer, and by Christmas Travolta was back in theaters as a disreputable angel in Michael. The following year he reunited with Woo in the highly successful thriller Face/Off, which he trailed with a supporting turn in Nick Cassavetes' She's So Lovely. After 1997's Mad City, Travolta began work on Primary Colors, Mike Nichols' political satire, portraying a charismatic, Bill Clinton-like U.S. President. An adaptation of the acclaimed book A Civil Action followed, as did the 1999 thriller The General's Daughter, in which Travolta co-starred with Madeline Stowe.  Travolta did suffer an embarrassment in 2000, when he produced and starred in the sci-fi thriller Battlefield Earth, based on the novel by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard (whose teachings Travolta publicly admired and advocated). The film was universally panned as so bad it was funny, but Travolta bounced back, shedding some pounds to play the baddie in 2001 action thriller Swordfish. A complex tale of mixed loyalties, computer hacking, and espionage, Swordfish teamed Travolta with X-Men star Hugh Jackman in hopes of dominating the summer box office. This put Travolta in good shape to weather another disappointment, when his dramatic Oscar contender  A Love Song for Bobby Long, was not well received by audiences or critics. While he received more praise for his performance in Ladder 49, a film about the lives of firefighters, his career took another hit in 2004 when he reprised the role of Chili Palmer in Be Cool, a sequel  to Get Shorty that proved to have none of the magic that made its predecessor so successful.  Unfazed, Travolta signed on to star in the 2007 Baby Boomer comedy Wild Hogs, alongside a dream cast of Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy, who played four listless suburbanites who decide to "live on the edge" by grabbing their sawed-off choppers and hitting the open road as would-be Hell's Angels. Later that year, Travolta took another comedic turn in Hairspray, Adam Shankman's screen adaptation of the stage musical (which, in turn, is an adaptation of John Waters's 1988 feature), which put Travolta in drag to play the heavy set, bouffant hair-do'd mother once played by drag queen Divine. He would follow this up with some middling action fare, with The Taking of Pelham 13 and From Paris with Love, as well as a sequel to Wild Hogs, 2009's Old Dogs. ~ Jason Ankeny, Rovi

He was aching for it so much that the Englewood, New Jersey, native dropped out of school at 16 and began acting in summer stock theater around New Jersey. TV commercials and some off-Broadway work followed before he moved to Hollywood where he landed a job in the touring company of Grease (a role he later reprised on the screen). But it was when he was cast as Vinnie Barbarino in the 1970s TV series Welcome Back, Kotter that Travolta vaulted to stardom. 
Travolta's second film was the now cult-classic horror film, Carrie (1976). But it was when he took to the dance floor in Saturday Night Fever (1977) that Travolta electrified audiences and became a huge star. He was on top of the Hollywood food chain for many years before falling out of favor for some time. About that period, he says, "It wasn't until a year before I did Pulp Fiction that I said, 'Wait a minute, I'm not getting any scripts that don't have the title Look Who's Talking Three.' I had to admit to myself, Oh man, it's over." 
But over it wasn't. Travolta staged a remarkable comeback with Pulp Fiction (1994), playing a sort of Vinnie Barbarino gone bad. Since then he's put himself back on the A-List and seems to be working overtime to make up for the lost years. "My reason for working a lot is that I am now consistently being offered the top scripts, with the top directors, for the first time in my life," he says. "I don't want to blow that opportunity." 
Since Pulp Fiction, Travolta has gone on to star in many memorable films, like Face/Off (1997) opposite Nicolas Cage, Swordfish (2001) with Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry, the emotional firefighter movie Ladder 49 (2004), the film adaptation of the popular stage production Hairspray (2007) in which Travolta played the part of a woman and most recently, Savages (2012).
Travolta is married to Kelly Preston. In fact, they were married twice after their first ceremony, conducted by a Scientologist minister, was declared illegal. They have two children together, but their son, Jett, died at the age of 16 after falling and hitting his head in the bathroom of their vacation home in the Bahamas. 
In May 2012, Travolta became involved in a shocking scandal when several male masseurs came forward accusing him of sexual harassment. The actor and his lawyer adamantly maintained that the claims were completely false.
Travolta's main hobby is flying planes and he owns several, including a Lear and a Boeing 707. In September 2010, he actually flew Oprah Winfrey's entire studio audience to Australia.

Birth Name: John Joseph TravoltaBirth Place: Englewood, NJDate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 02/18/1954, AquariusProfession: Actor; singer; dancer
The youngest member of a family of actors, Travolta began his career as a juvenile TV player. After guest-starring on myriad series, he signed on to Welcome Back, Kotter in 1975 and became an instant teen idol. The next year he starred as the title character in the TV-movie The Boy in the Plastic Bubble and embarked on an ill-fated romance with Diana Hyland, the older actress who played his mother; she soon died of cancer. Despite this personal setback, he was on a roll professionally, with an Oscar-nominated turn as a disco dancer in 1977's Saturday Night Fever and a charismatic performance as a 1950s delinquent in the musical Grease the next year. A series of box-office disappointments (Moment by Moment, Two of a Kind, Perfect) followed, but his nuanced performance as a hit man in the hip 1994 film Pulp Fiction revived his career and earned him an Oscar nod. Diverse, high-profile roles in a series of films followed, some successful and some not (most notably 2000's critically disparaged Battlefield Earth, which he also produced). On the home front, Travolta married Kelly Preston (who fell for him when they costarred in The Experts) in 1991 and the pair had two children. Tragedy struck, however, in 2009 when their son, Jett, died at the age of 16. In 2010, Travolta put his passion for flying to good use when he and Preston flew medical supplies and personnel to the earthquake-ravaged Haiti. Off screen, Travolta is an active follower of Scientology.John Travolta Fast Facts:
