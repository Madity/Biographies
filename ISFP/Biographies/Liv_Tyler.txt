 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Daughter of Steven Tyler of the band Aerosmith and Bebe Buell, former model (and Playboy Playmate of the Month) and stalwart of the backstage rock scene of the 1970s, Liv grew up thinking that rock star Todd Rundgren was her father. But as she was growing up, Tyler began dropping by to visit, and Liv noticed that his daughter Mia Tyler looked enough like her to be her twin. She confronted her mother, and was told the truth; by the time she was 12, she had taken her father's name. At 14, she and her mother left Portland, Maine, for New York, where she got her start as a model. A year was enough of the modeling grind, and she decided to become an actress. She was offered the part of "Callie" in Heavy (1995) after a single reading and, only three weeks later, was cast in Silent Fall (1994); James Mangold, director of Heavy (1995), decided to delay shooting until Liv was available. With seven films in the 1993-96 period, her career took off.
      Liv's mother named her after Liv Ullmann because she was on the cover of TV Guide several weeks prior to Liv's birth, on March 5, 1977.
      A cameo role in Everyone Says I Love You (1996), a musical directed by Woody Allen, was cut; Allen was impressed enough by her performance to write a personal letter explaining that her part was cut in editing.
Aerosmith's video for "Crazy", in which Liv co-starred with Alicia Silverstone, was voted #23 in VH1's top 100 music videos of all time.
      During filming for The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), she left her pair of prosthetic ears on the dashboard of her car. When she returned, they had melted.
      Learned swordfighting for her role as Arwen in the The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001). But the script was changed and she never got to use her skills.
      Was nicknamed Liv Taylor by film critics and the media when she first began acting because her dark hair and striking blue eyes reminded them of Elizabeth Taylor.
      The decision to cast her in the video for "Crazy" was based on seeing her Pantene commercial, with absolutely no knowledge her father was in the band.
      Voted #2 in TheAge.com's Top 100: Natural Beauties of all time. (Audrey Hepburn took the top spot)
      (December 14, 2004) Her son Milo was born on the same day as the release of the Platinum Series Special Extended Edition of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
      On a TV documentary about the making of the Lord of the Rings movies, she said she really liked delivering her lines when they were in the fictional Elvish language.
      Her father has English, German, Italian, Polish and Welsh ancestry, and her mother has English, German, Scottish and Welsh roots.
      Recorded a song for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), but because Peter Jackson didn't feel the song was right for the intended scene, he put it into the extended edition of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003). Since then, Liv has stated how much she enjoyed singing and recording and how she has always felt a strong relationship towards music.
      Is only eight years younger than Cate Blanchett, but plays her granddaughter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
      She and her Lord of the Rings castmate John Rhys-Davies have both appeared in films about "The Incredible Hulk". Rhys-Davies plays "Wilson Fisk", aka The Kingpin, in The Trial of the Incredible Hulk (1989), while Tyler played "Betty Ross" in The Incredible Hulk (2008). Daredevil and Kingpin have also been played by her Armageddon (1998) castmates Ben Affleck and Michael Clarke Duncan.
      Friends with Orlando Bloom, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Moss, Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, Dax Shepard, Elijah Wood, Helena Christensen, Stella McCartney.
      Believed until she was 8 years old that Todd Rundgren was her father. Rundgren and Liv's mother were in a relationship when Liv was born and conceived.
      Considers Todd Rundgren, whom she believed to be her father until she was 8 years old, as her "spiritual dad".
      Her two "dads" Steven Tyler and Todd Rundgren met for the first time at her wedding to Royston Langdon.
      Has played the daughter of characters to influential actors like Will Patton in Inventing the Abbotts (1997), Bruce Willis in Armageddon (1998), Hugo Weaving in "The Lord of the Rings", William Hurt in The Incredible Hulk (2008) and Frank Langella in Robot & Frank (2012).
      Gave birth to her 1st child at age 27, a son Milo William Langdon on December 14, 2004. Child's father is her now ex-husband, Royston Langdon.
      I have these slumber parties with my father and when we can't sleep we stay up all night trading beauty tips. He knows all about the good creams and masks.
      [About her favorite smell] Those smells that remind me of home. I can smell my dad [Steven Tyler] from a mile away. I can smell it whenever he's worn my clothes. He has this ambery smell that just melts into him.
      [on playing Arwen in "The Lord of the Rings"] It wasn't until I came back home after such a long time away that I realized how much hype there was about this. I get to play someone 3,000 years old. I'm 23, so that's quite an acting challenge.
      I've been told that if I'd lose weight I'd have more work, but I refuse to submit myself to those standards. To the rest of the world, I'm slim, and I like the way I am.
      When I did Stealing Beauty (1996), I was just a kid. I'd done a couple of movies, but I'd never been to an acting class in my life. But what I took away from it more than anything was the sense that, even though I was the central character, it was my job to get completely lost in the film. I had a real awareness of Bernardo Bertolucci as a filmmaker, not just a director, painting a canvas in which I was just one element.
      Subtlety is my favourite thing in cinema. It lets you dream. When everything is on the nail and on show, it leaves no questions in your mind. I find that so boring.
      Clothes have become too important and films are saturated with fashion. So you find yourself wearing designer clothes that aren't relevant to your character. I'm always so intrigued by Christopher Guest and his movies, like Best in Show (2000) and A Mighty Wind (2003). He hires the actors and they all come up with the story and the concept, improvise. And they are all responsible for their own hair and make-up. They buy their own clothes, are in control of creating their characters. I would love to do that.
      Life excites me. I'm not talking about appearing in movies or doing interviews, but just little, normal, everyday things. Getting out of bed. Getting dressed. Making food. I find it all exciting, you know?
      I don't live a very posh life. There are no drivers waiting or people doing everything for me. I pretty much live like a normal person... It's not good to have a life without responsibilities, you know?
      There were times when I would get mad at him (Viggo Mortensen) because he would push me harder. There was a weekend when I got really sick and had a horrible flu, and that was my one and only day to sleep and recover and not work. We were supposed to go horseback riding together and I cancelled it because I wasn't feeling well, and Viggo gave me a really hard time about it. So I went, and it was one of the greatest days of my life. It was actually the one time, while I was riding, that I really broke through to the other side with the canter and becoming more comfortable on the horse. I had a beautiful day and am incredibly grateful to Viggo for pushing me further. He taught me so much about that, about really being willing to submit and submerge yourself into making the film and the character work.
      My mom [Bebe Buell] was so amazing. She was a singer and she'd been a model so she had all these beautiful clothes and makeup, and in the bathroom all her jewelry was pinned to the wall...it was more than a little girl could ever dream of! When she went out, she would always say, "Don't get into my stuff!" and the first thing I would do was go mad dressing up.
      I was in New Zealand for a long time and preparing for fight sequences - all of these kind of elaborate things. And the more I did that stuff the further we were getting away from why they cast me and what was true of Arwen. And we all realized that. And we went back into the book and into the appendix. And... reshaped it. I think originally that, when they were looking at this character, they wanted her to be a strong character. She is a strong character, but... maybe they thought, "Oh, well if she's a fighter she's strong." And over time they realized that you don't have to put a sword in a woman's hand to make her seem tough. That's little actual makeup of who Arwen is, and her sheer will and strength and love for this man was strong enough.
      [on Edward Norton] Edward is the best! He is so sweet and wonderful and he did such a great job with everything he did for this film (The Incredible Hulk (2008)) and everything he brought to it. I'm really grateful to have been in it. There were points when I was like, "Wait! We cannot do this love scene because his body looks so much more beautiful than mine!".
      [on Ben Affleck] Ben is an angel! By some reason we have a special chemistry. I've worked with some of the world's most fantastic actors and actresses and I love them all, but I actually feel a special spark when we act together. It's easy for us to be very free together.
      [on Mary Helen Bowers] Mary Helen is wonderful! We train together using her Ballet Beautiful program doing leg work, butt lifts, and stretches. I love working out with her.

Liv Rundgren Tyler[1] (born Liv Rundgren; July 1, 1977) is an American actress and former child model. She is the daughter of Aerosmith's lead singer, Steven Tyler, and model Bebe Buell. Tyler began a career in modeling at the age of 14 but, after less than a year, she decided to focus on acting. After her film debut Silent Fall (1994), she appeared in supporting roles in Empire Records (1995), Heavy (1996) and That Thing You Do! (1996). Tyler later achieved critical recognition in the leading role in Stealing Beauty (1996). She followed this by starring in supporting roles including Inventing the Abbotts (1997) and Cookie's Fortune (1999).
Tyler achieved international recognition as a result of her portrayal of Elf maiden Arwen Undómiel in the Lord of the Rings film trilogy. She has appeared in an eclectic range of films, including the 2004 comedy Jersey Girl, the indie film Lonesome Jim (2005), the drama Reign Over Me (2007) and big-budget studio films such as Armageddon (1998), The Strangers (2008) and The Incredible Hulk (2008).
She has served as a United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Goodwill Ambassador for the United States in 2003, and as a spokesperson for Givenchy's line of perfume and cosmetics.
Tyler was born Liv Rundgren[1] at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.[2] She is the only daughter of Bebe Buell, a model, singer, and former Playboy Playmate (Miss November 1974), and Steven Tyler, the lead singer of Aerosmith.[3] Her mother named her after Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann, after seeing Ullmann on the cover of the March 5, 1977 issue of TV Guide.[2][4] She is of Italian, German, Polish, and English ancestry on her father's side[5] and German ancestry on her mother's side.[6] Tyler has three half-siblings: Mia Tyler (born 1978),[7] Chelsea Anna Tallarico (born 1989), and Taj Monroe Tallarico (born 1992).[8] Her maternal grandmother, Dorothea Johnson, founded the Protocol School of Washington.[9]
From 1972 to 1979, Liv’s mother Bebe Buell had a longtime relationship with rock musician Todd Rundgren. During their cohabitation, sometimes they were on-and-off. In 1976, Buell became unexpectedly pregnant from her brief relationship with Steven Tyler. On July 1, 1977, Buell gave birth to Liv. But Buell initially named the daughter Liv Rundgren and claimed that Todd Rundgren was the biological father. Rundgren and Buell ended their romantic relationship shortly after Liv's birth, but Rundgren put his heart and soul into the "white lie".[1] At age eight Liv met Steven Tyler and noticed a resemblance she shared with his other daughter, Mia.[1][4][10] When she asked her mother about the similarity, the secret was revealed.[1][10] The truth about Tyler's paternity did not become public until six years later in 1991, when she changed her name from Rundgren to Tyler,[1][3] but kept the former as a middle name.[citation needed] Buell's stated reason for the initial decision was that Steven was too heavily addicted to drugs at the time of her birth.[3] Since learning the truth about her paternity, Liv and Steven have developed a close relationship.[1] They also have worked together professionally, once when she appeared in Aerosmith's music video for "Crazy" in 1993, and again when Aerosmith performed many of the songs in the film Armageddon (1998) in which Tyler starred.[1]
According to Tyler "... Todd [Rundgren] basically decided when I was born that I needed a father so he signed my birth certificate. He knew that there was a chance that I might not be his but …." He paid to put her through private school, and she visited him several times a year.[11]
Tyler maintains a close relationship with Rundgren. "I’m so grateful to him, I have so much love for him. You know, when he holds me it feels like Daddy. And he’s very protective and strong."[11]
Tyler attended the Congressional Schools of Virginia, Breakwater School and Waynflete School in Portland, Maine,[12][13][14] before returning to New York City with her mother at age 12.[1][4] She went to York Preparatory in New York City for junior high and high school after her mother researched the school to accommodate Tyler's ADHD.[15] She graduated in 1995, and left to continue her acting career.[1][4] When asked about the way she spent her early life, Tyler said: "For me, I didn’t get much of a childhood in my teen years because I’ve been working since I was 14. But that also kept me out of trouble. When everybody was doing acid and partying like crazy, I was at work on a movie in Tuscany ... having my own fun, of course, but it was a different kind of thing. I have no regrets. I love the way my life has gone."[16]
Tyler received her first modeling job at age 14 with the assistance of Paulina Porizkova, who took pictures of her that ended up in Interview magazine.[1][4] She later starred in television commercials.[1][4] She, however, became bored with her modeling career less than a year after it started, and decided to go into acting, although[4] she never took acting lessons.[3] Tyler first became known to television audiences when she starred alongside Alicia Silverstone in the music video for Aerosmith's 1993 song "Crazy".[1]
Tyler made her feature film debut in Silent Fall in 1994, where she played the elder sister of a boy with autism.[17] In 1995, she starred in the comedy drama Empire Records.[18] Tyler has described Empire Records as "one of the best experiences" she has ever had.[19] Soon after, she landed a supporting role in James Mangold's 1996 drama Heavy as Callie, a naive young waitress. The film received favorable reviews;[20] critic Janet Maslin noted: "Ms. Tyler ... gives a charmingly ingenuous performance, betraying no self-consciousness about her lush good looks."[21]
Tyler had her breakthrough role in Stealing Beauty (1996), in which she played Lucy Harmon, an innocent, romantic teenager who travels to Tuscany, Italy, intent on losing her virginity. The film received generally mixed reviews,[22] but Tyler's performance was favored by the critics; Variety wrote: "Tyler is the perfect accomplice. At times sweetly awkward, at others composed and serene, the actress appears to respond effortlessly and intuitively to the camera, creating a rich sense of what Lucy is about that often is not explicit in the dialogue."[23] Empire noted, "Liv Tyler (here radiantly resembling a ganglier young Ava Gardner) with a rare opportunity to enamour, a break she capitalizes on with composure."[24] The film was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, who chose Tyler for the role after meeting with a number of young girls in Los Angeles, including Tyler's music video co-star Alicia Silverstone. Bertolucci claimed "there was something missing in all of them".[25] He later admitted that what he saw in Tyler was a gravitas he described as "a New York aura".[25] During promotion of the film, Tyler admitted she wanted to separate herself from the character during production; "I tried my damnedest not to think of my own situation. But at one point, after a take, I just started to cry and cry. I remembered when I found out about my dad and how we just stared at each other from head to toe taking in every nook and cranny."[25]
She later appeared in That Thing You Do! (1996), a movie about a fictional one-hit wonder rock band called The Oneders, following their whirlwind rise to the top of the pop charts, and just as quickly, their plunge back to obscurity.[26] The film was written and directed by Tom Hanks.[27] It grossed over $25 million worldwide,[28] and was met with favorable reviews.[29] The following year, she appeared in Inventing the Abbotts in 1997, in which she played the daughter of Will Patton and Barbara Williams' characters.[30] The movie is based on a short story by Sue Miller.[31] Entertainment Weekly declared Tyler's performance as "lovely and pliant".[32] That same year, Tyler was chosen by People magazine as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People.[33]
Tyler next appeared in Armageddon (1998), where she played the daughter of Bruce Willis' character and love interest of Ben Affleck's character. The film generated mixed reviews,[34] but was a box office success earning $553 million worldwide.[28] The movie included the songs "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" and "What Kind of Love Are You On" by Aerosmith.[35] In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she admitted that she turned down the role in Armageddon; "I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I was scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career - I just want it to be special when I make a movie."[13]
She was then cast in the drama Onegin (1999), a film based on the 19th century Russian novel of the same name by Alexander Pushkin, in which she portrayed Tatyana Larina and co-starred with Ralph Fiennes.[36] Tyler was required to master an English accent, though Stephen Holden of the New York Times felt that her approximation of an English accent was "inert".[37] The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.[28][38] That same year, she appeared in the historical comedy film Plunkett & Macleane.[39][40]
She later appeared in two films directed by Robert Altman, Cookie's Fortune (1999) and Dr. T & the Women (2000).[1][36] In Cookie's Fortune, she was part of an ensemble cast that included Glenn Close, Julianne Moore, Chris O'Donnell, and Patricia Neal.[41] Her performance well received among critics; Salon.com wrote: "This is the first time in which Tyler's acting is a match for her beauty (she's always been a bit forlorn). Altman helps her find some snap, but a relaxed, silly snap, as in the cartoon sound she makes when she takes a midday swig of bourbon. The lazy geniality of the movie is summed up by the way Emma [Tyler's character] saunters off to take a swim with her cowboy hat and pint of Wild Turkey."[42] Entertainment Weekly also noted that Tyler is "sweetly gruff as the tomboy troublemaker".[43] In the romantic comedy, Dr. T & the Women, she played Marilyn, a gynecological patient of Richard Gere's character, who is the lesbian lover of his daughter, played by Kate Hudson.[44]
In 2001, Tyler played the object of infatuation for three men (Matt Dillon, John Goodman and Paul Reiser) in the black comedy One Night at McCool's.[45] In discussion of the role, she said: "This was definitely the first part where I had to be so physically aware and have people so aware of me physically. Maybe it's not hard for anybody else, but it is a bit for me. I mean I love my body and I feel very comfortable in my skin, but this was tough."[46] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: "Tyler, a true beauty, gives the role a valiant try, but her range is too limited to play this amalgam of female perfection."[47]
In 2001, she starred in the feature film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, directed by Peter Jackson. She played the Elf maiden Arwen Undómiel.[46][48] The film is based on the first volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in Plunkett & Macleane.[49] She learned to speak the fictitious Elvish language that was created by Tolkien.[50] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle noted that Tyler's performance was "lovely and earnest".[51]
A year later, Tyler again starred as Arwen in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, the second installment of the series. The film received favorable reviews.[52] Tyler spent months before filming learning sword fighting, to be used during the concluding battle scenes in The Two Towers,[53] though her scenes from the battle were removed after the script was changed.[53] The film was an enormous box office success, earning over $926 million worldwide,[54] out-grossing its predecessor, which earned over $871 million.[28] In 2003, Tyler featured in the third and last installment of the series, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.[55]
Following the success of The Lord of the Rings, she appeared opposite her Armageddon co-star Ben Affleck in writer-director Kevin Smith's romantic comedy Jersey Girl (2004), playing a woman who re-opens a widowed father's heart to love, played by Affleck.[56] In an interview with MTV News, Tyler confessed that she felt "scared and vulnerable" while filming Jersey Girl, adding "I was so used to those other elements of the character [Arwen]. On The Lord of the Rings, a lot of things were done in post-production, whereas this was really just about me and Ben sitting there, just shooting off dialogue."[57] However, she reiterated that doing Jersey Girl was what she wanted to do.[57]
In 2005, she appeared in Steve Buscemi's independent drama Lonesome Jim, where she was cast alongside Casey Affleck, as a single mother and nurse who reconnects with an old fling who has returned to their small town of Indiana after a failed run as a novelist in New York.[57] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival where it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize.[58] Tyler's next appearance in film was in a supporting role as an insightful therapist who tries to help a once-successful dentist (Adam Sandler) cope with the loss of his family during the events of the September 11th attacks in Reign Over Me (2007).[59][60]
In 2008, she starred in the horror-thriller The Strangers with Scott Speedman, a film about a young couple who are terrorized one night by three masked assailants in their remote country house.[61][62] Although the film garnered a mixed reception among critics,[63] it was a box office success.[28] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, she noted that The Strangers was the most challenging role of her career. "It was as far as I could push myself in every way: physically, emotionally, mentally."[19]
She appeared in The Incredible Hulk (2008), in which she played Dr. Betty Ross, the love interest of the title character, played by Edward Norton.[64] Tyler was attracted to the love story in the script, and was a fan of the television show.[65] She said filming the part was "very physical, which was fun",[66] and compared her performance to "a deer caught in the headlights".[67] The Incredible Hulk was a box office success, earning over $262 million worldwide.[28] The Washington Post, in review of the film, wrote: "Tyler gives Betty an appropriately angelic nimbus of ethereal gentleness as the one Beauty who can tame the Beast ... during their most pivotal encounters."[68]
Tyler appeared in two films released in 2011: Super and The Ledge. In April 2011, publishing house Rodale announced that Tyler and her grandmother Dorothea Johnson, an etiquette expert, have written a book called Modern Manners. It was released October 29, 2013.[citation needed]
In 2014 she appeared in Space Station 76, a film directed by Jack Plotnick, starring also Matt Bomer and Patrick Wilson.[69]
In 1998, Tyler began dating British musician Royston Langdon of the band Spacehog.[1] She and Langdon became engaged in February 2001,[70] and married in Barbados on March 25, 2003.[71] On December 14, 2004, she gave birth to a son, Milo William Langdon.[72] On May 8, 2008, the couple confirmed through representatives that they would be separating but remain friends.[73] In an interview with the Australian Daily Telegraph, Tyler revealed that her separation from Langdon led her to move to Los Angeles, explaining that it was hard to be in the Manhattan home that they had shared.[74] In June 2010, Tyler stated she was "far too sensitive" for casual dates, adding "I fall in love once in a blue moon."[75]
Tyler is an active supporter of the charitable United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). She was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United States in 2003.[76][77] In November 2004, she hosted the lighting of the UNICEF Snowflake in New York City. Tyler also served as spokesperson for the 2004 Givenchy Mother's Day promotion, in support of UNICEF's Maternal & Neonatal Tetanus (MNT) campaign.
Since 2004, she has donated to the Women's Cancer Research Fund to support innovative research, education, and outreach directed at the development of more effective approaches to the early diagnosis, treatment and prevention of all women's cancers.[78] In October 2007, Tyler, along with her mother, Bebe Buell and her grandmother, Dorothea Johnson, helped launch the Emergen-C Pink energy drink, in which the event was in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness month.[79]
She is good friends with designer Stella McCartney,[7] model Helena Christensen and actresses Kate Hudson, Chloë Sevigny and Gwyneth Paltrow.[7][19] Tyler was formerly a vegan, but has since begun to eat meat.[80] In 2003, she became the spokesperson for Givenchy perfume and cosmetics;[81][82] in 2005 the brand named a rose after her, which was used in one of its fragrances.[83] In 2009, Tyler signed on for two more years as Givenchy spokesperson.[74] On December 8, 2011, Givenchy announced a collaboration between Givenchy perfumes and Sony Music.[84] In the video released on February 7, 2012, Liv Tyler covered INXS song "Need You Tonight".[85]
Tyler learned Transcendental Meditation in New York City.[86] In December 2012 she participated in a charity gala for the David Lynch Foundation to provide Transcendental Meditation to disadvantaged sections of society.[87] At the event she said, "it helps me make better decisions and be a better mother, and just deal with the daily stress of the modern world that we live in. It helps with everything."[86]

1976Rock Stars & Centerfolds1974 Playboy centerfold Bebe Buell has an eight-month romance with Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler. In July 1977, while in a relationship with rocker Todd Rundgren, Buell (right) gives birth to a daughter she names Liv Rundgren. Rundgren is listed as the father on the birth certificate because Tyler is in the middle of his well-documented drug excesses. "Todd's my spiritual father. I love him," Liv tells PEOPLE in 1992.1986Discovering Daddy TylerBuell introduces Liv to Steven Tyler at a Rundgren show but not as his daughter. "I didn't know what it was, but I started to see him more, and it would mean so much to me that I would write about it in my diary," she tells PEOPLE in 1992. "I was very confused." When Liv sees Mia (Steven's daughter with his first wife Cyrinda, who is a splitting image of Liv) at an Aerosmith concert in 1988, she realizes Steven is her biological father. ''I don't think my dad was in any position to be a father. Steven, that is,'' Tyler (pictured with Mia and Steven) tells the AP in 2001. ''What an amazing thing Todd did for me…luckily, it just made me feel more loved. It meant that I had two dads instead of one.''1991Model ModeWhile living in NYC's Greenwich Village, Tyler, 14, begins modeling when former supermodel Paulina Porizkova takes photos of her that end up in Interview magazine. "Everything on Liv's face is right, and with the dark hair and pale skin, she looks very now," Porizkova tells PEOPLE. In November 1992, she lands on the cover of Seventeen. "It happened sort of naturally, since I've been around this all my life," Liv tells PEOPLE.1994"Crazy" for LivTyler stars in Aerosmith's music video for  "Crazy." Tyler and Alicia Silverstone (right) play schoolgirls who cut class, tease oogling boys on the road, and hang out at a strip club. "Steven and I vetoed the first script," Buell tells EW of the video. "Omigod, it had some racy stuff in there. It had a kiss between Liv and Alicia. Steven and I just looked at each other and went: 'Uh-huh, sure. When hell freezes over!'" It creates buzz for Tyler, who makes her film debut in Silent Fall, starring Richard Dreyfuss.November 03The Tylers on Rolling StoneA 17-year-old Tyler and her 46-year-old father appear on the cover of Rolling Stone, where she discusses leaving modeling and her role in her father's music video: "I understand why people might have a problem with it, but I have no problem with it, and Steven has no problem with it, and if other people have a problem with it, it's their problem." When Steven is asked about Liv's status as a sex symbol, he responds, "As a father I'm a realist. You can teach your children well and hope you've taught them some good sense...I told my daughters…'Flaunt it. But if you lift your skirt, every little boy's tongue's gonna want to be up there.'"1995Liv Tyler & Joaquin PhoenixTyler meets actor Joaquin Phoenix (right) on the set of Inventing the Abbotts. The two begin dating and eventually move in together during their three-year romance. Her father tells USA Today, "I told Liv, 'You'll always have that movie. You can look back and see yourselves falling in love.'"1996June 14Stealing BeautyTyler stars in Bernardo Bertolucci's Stealing Beauty (left) as Lucy Harmon, an innocent, romantic teenager who travels to Italy intent on losing her virginity. The New York Times says Tyler looks "like a lithe young Ava Gardner," and Bertolucci tells the paper, "The presence of the girl on the set had a bit of the same effect it has in the story." She also appears in Tom Hanks' That Thing You Do!.1998July 01A Blockbuster ArmageddonTyler plays Bruce Willis' daughter and Ben Affleck's (left) love interest in the summer blockbuster Armageddon. The film grosses more than $201 million worldwide, and Aerosmith provides the movie's theme song, "I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing." "I figured if I got a couple songs in this movie, I'd get a chance to spend time with Liv," Steven tells USA Today. "I never see her. These days, she does three movies to my one album."FallTyler & LangdonTyler begins dating British rocker Royston Langdon (left) of Spacehog. In early 2001, the pair gets engaged. "He was very romantic about it," she tells In Style in 2004. "He called my dad and asked his permission, which my dad loved." On March 25, 2003, Tyler, 25, and Langdon, 30, wed in a private ceremony in the Caribbean. "It was an incredible experience because my mother, Todd and Steven had never been in a room together before, and Todd and Steven had never met," Tyler adds. "But in the end it was beautiful and a nice healing moment for all of our families."1999April 02Teaming with Robert AltmanTyler costars with Chris O'Donnell, Glenn Close and Julianne Moore in Robert Altman's Cookie's Fortune (right). She wins raves for her turn as the rebellious tomboy member of an eccentric Deep South matriarchy. The New York Times says, "Ms. Tyler, who fits right into the Altman ensemble style, makes it easy to understand why Emma is admired by a police rookie and a Peeping Tom with equal ardor." She reteams with Altman for 2000's Dr. T and the Women.

   Childhood       iv was born on July 1st, 1977 in New York in the name Liv Rundgren.			            Her mom Bebe Buell, and her mom's life-partner Todd Rundgren, raised her as parents.			            Liv thought her dad was Todd Rundgren.			            Shortly after Liv's birth, her mom broke up with Todd and moved up with Liv to Portland, Maine.			                			      In her childhood, Liv was living discursively with her mom, her aunt Annie at Maine, and her grandmother Dorothea Johnson at Virginia.			      Already as a little girl, she loved to perform - dress up in her mothers clothes and make up and put on a show in front of her mother's friends.			      Liv insists that she was a normal kid, just incredibly tall compared to her class-mates and chubby ...  iv found out that her real father is Steven Tyler at the age of 9. it was at an Aerosmith concert.      			            Liv began to suspect earlier:			            "I didn't know what it was, but I started to see him more, and it would mean so much to me that I would write about it in my diary," she says. "I was very confused.", Aerosmith's concert put an end to the suspects.			            			            Liv's half-sister Mia (the second daughter of Steven Tyler), whom Liv never saw before, was in that concert too.			             			      When Liv saw that she looked remarkably like her, she had no doubt - Steven Tyler's daugher is her sister - which means that the man who's performing on stage is her father.			      Later that evening, Liv's mom told her the truth: "I turned to my mom and said, 'He's my father, isn't he ?', and we went out under a tree and talked and cried for two hours." 			      At the age of 12 Liv changed her last name to Tyler.  Career       			            When Liv was 14 she moved back with her mom to NY.			            A friend of the family, Paulina Porizkova - a famous model herself - convinced Liv to start modeling - and the rest is history ...   			            Instantly Liv's career as a model sky-rocketed, and Liv found herself on the cover of big Magazines like Seventeen, Interview and Mirabella.			                    iv's first major revelation to the world came in 1994, when she was 16, in Aerosmith's clip - Crazy.			            Liv was embarrassed by her sexy appearances - but got the adoration of millions of teenagers around the world.			            Father was happy too ;-)			                			      At that year Liv started filming her first 2 movies - Silent Fall (1994) and Heavy (1995).			      Liv tasted it, and liked it! She decided to quit modeling and concentrate on her acting career.			      At age 17, Liv filmed her third movie - Empire Records (1995), but her breakthrough			      came from her next film - Stealing Beauty (1996).			           			            The legendary director Bernardo Bertolucci chose Liv over hundreds of actresses.			            Liv got acclaims on her performance, and was the highlight of '96 Cannes film festival where giant photos of her peered placidly from billboards all over town.			            This film established Liv as a Movie Star - performing opposite			            other stars like Tom Hanks [That Thing You Do! (1996)] and Bruce Willis [Armageddon (1998)] and working with best directors around.			              iv chooses her films carefully. She avoids big movies and prefers the smaller, more quality ones.			      Her movies include Inventing The Abbotts (1997), with her former boyfriend Joaquin Phoenix, Cookie's Fortune (1999) by Robert Altman, Plunkett & Macleane (1999) and Onegin (1999) with Ralph Fiennes.      			            More movies include Dr. T and the Women (2000) - another comedy by Robert Altman along side Richard Gere and Kate Hudson,			            One Night At McCool's (2001) - the major role in a black comedy along side Michael Douglas, Matt Dillon, John Goodman and Paul Raiser			            and Lord Of The Rings movie series (2001-2003) - 3 movies based on the famous trilogy by J.R.R Tolkien - in the role of Arwen the elf princess.
			            The last movie in the trilogy (The Return of the King) - won 11 Oscars, including the best picture award.
						Then Liv and Ben's brother - Casey Affleck stared in Lonesome Jim, directed by Steve Buscemi. The movie was filmed in March 2004 and released in March 2006.						After almost a two years break from movies after the birth of her child Milo, Liv returned to the movie scene with 4 new movies:
Reign Over Me - a drama by director Mike Binder, staring Adam Sandler. Liv played as a psychiatrist. The movie was filmed in spring 2006, and was released in March 2007.
The Strangers - a thriller writed and directed by Bryan Bertino. Liv is part of a young couple terrorized by three unknown assailants. The film was released in May 2008 and was a big hit.
Smother - a Comedy/Drama by Vince Di Meglio and Tim Rasmussen. Liv played along side Diane Keaton and Dax Shepard. The movie was released in 2008.
						Liv also scored the leading female role in Marvel's The Incredible Hulk along side Edward Norton. The movie smashed screens on June 13th 2008.
						Aside from her movie career Liv has always kept her modeling career with campaigns for major companies like Pantene, Givenchy, Gap, Pilgrim and many more.
						In 2003 Liv has been selected to be the new face of Givenchy, following the footsteps of Audrey Hepburn. The first product published by Liv is "Very Irresistible Givenchy" perfume, as can be seen on TV commercials and magazines.
						More campaigns were "Givenchy le Makeup", "Givenchy - Ready to Wear and Accessories" and more. In Summer 2005 Givenchy decided to call a rose after Liv - the "Liv Tyler Rose"!						Now days Liv continues to promote Givenchy products around the world (New York, Paris, Moscow, Madrid, Dubai to name a few places).												
						In 2007, Liv was also the face of Pilgrim - one of the world's leading jewellery and accessory brands.												In 2010, Liv became the face of the denim brand G-Star, for Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter campaigns.			                
  						After the divorce from her husband in 2008, Liv took another 2 years off. Liv came back to the silver screen in 2011 with two new movies:
The Ledge - a drama/thriller by Matthew Chapman, along side Charlie Hunnam, Terrence Howard and Patrick Wilson.
						In 2011, 15 years after did her first Pantene commercial, Liv became the face of Pantene for the second time, with a brand new commercial and ads.			            			            In the private level, Liv got engaged in February 2001. The lucky man is Royston Langdon - a musician, also known as the lead singer of the Rock bands - Spacehog and Arckid.			            More than 2 years afterwards, in March 25th 2003, Liv and Roy got married in a private ceremony in the Caribbean.			            						In June 2004 Liv and her husband announced Liv's first pregnancy. In December 14th 2004 Liv become a mother after giving birth to her son - Milo William Langdon.						
     Liv - the person 			      Despite her star status and her fame, Liv is known by her "down to earth" attitude,			      charm and kindness. The word "arrogance" doesn't exist in her lexicon.			            			            Somehow Liv managed to keep her private life just that. The restraint has served Liv well, making her seem more mature than many of her peers and, perhaps, even her parents.			            She doesn't care for the nightclubbing high lifestyle and has said she envies her friends' college days. 			            Not that she's unhappy. "A lot has happened these last couple of years. But it's exhilarating," she said in '96,			            "It doesn't feel like too much. At least, not more than I can handle."  			      Dad agrees: "Liv has got all the talent in the world, but she also has the character to go with the talent, And she sure as hell didn't get that from me!"      I N T E R E S T I N G      She never took acting lessons She cut her hair short in 1998 for "Cookie's Fortune" Dyed her hair red in 1999 for "One Night At McCool's" She appeared in many commercials including: "Bongo" Jeans, "Pantene" Shampoo, "Lux" Shampoo and others She started smoking cigarettes at the age 15, and quit smoking at the age of 25 She says she likes tall, skinny guys with messy hair She is taller than her husband and her ex-boyfriend Her mom Bebe Buell was a famous model and a Rock & Roll groupie. She used to hang out with many Rock & Roll stars, and in fact she's a Rock & Roll singer herself. No doubt Liv inherited much of her looks from her, especially the blue eyes and the height (Bebe is 5'9.5", Liv is 5'10"). Her grandmother Dorothea Johnson (Bebe's mother) is an etiquette consultant and manages an etiquette school in Washington. And guess what ? - She was a model too! She turned down twice the role in "Armageddon" Her half-sister Mia is a plus-size model Her mother named her Liv after the Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann. Liv means 'life' in Norwegian, Swedish and Danish.

As a mate to Liv's mom Bebe Buell he agreed to be a father figure to Liv, when her real father Steven Tyler wasn't able to do so because of drugs problems.
In her childhood, Liv was told that Todd is her real father, and discovered the truth just at the age of 9.
Nevertheless, Liv and Todd remain close like a father and daughter, even today, as Liv considers him her "Spiritual" father, and Todd considers Liv as his own daughter.
Todd, like almost all the people who close to Liv, is a successful musician, and considers by many to be the "Ultimate Rock Cult Hero".
In the late 1960s Todd got a nation-wide audience as he appeared as lead guitarist for the band - NAZZ. Todd wrote and arranged almost all of the work that went into the three albums the group produced.
After the band broke up in the early 1970s Todd released solo albums under the name of Runt. His big solo success came in 1971 with We Gotta Get You a Woman and in 1973 with Something / Anything ?
In the middle of the 1970s Todd had a relationship with Liv's mom - Bebe Buell, relationship that broke down in 1976, but not for long.
In 1977 Bebe Buell got pregnant from Steven Tyler, but Steven, wasn't a dad material at that time. Considering all that Bebe asked Todd to comeback to her, and to be a father figure to her child.
Bebe and Todd got separated a few months after Liv's birth, but continued the father-daughter relationship between Todd and Liv.
Liv lived with her mom and her family, and visited Todd frequency, as she said: "I never really lived with my fathers, Todd [Rundgren] or Steven [Tyler] anyway, and yes, it did make me feel a little different, since everyone else had a typical mom and dad thing going on, but I had my grandfather and my uncle ... and I visited Todd all the time."
Interesting thing is, that besides as a baby, Liv first meeting with her real dad Steven Tyler (without knowing he is her father) was at Todd's performance - "I was actually at one of Todd's shows with my mom. I was sitting there watching Todd play - I was so proud of
him, you know, my dad being up there - and then suddenly my mom said to me, 'I want to introduce you to someone,'
and I was like 'I dont want to go.' So she pointed at this guy sitting by the bar, and I was like 'Is that Mick Jagger's
son ?' and she laughed so hard. 'No, thats Steven Tyler,' she said. I connected with him immediately - it was almost
like I fell in love with him. I thought about him all the time! I didn't find out he was my dad 'til about a year later ..."
Todd lived for years with Karen Darvin - who he have 2 sons with - Rex (who is a professional Baseball player) and Randy.
In recent years, Todd has become a computer enthusiast, marketing many new innovations, some in conjunction with his music. He has also been called upon by movies and TV for his musical scores.
He is now married to Michele - who he have one son with - Rebop, living in Hawaii, and continue releasing albums - mainly love ballads, laced with heavy guitar rock.
Liv on Todd: "Todd is my dad as much as Steven is, in different ways of course, but at that time, yes, there definitly were some upset feelings - more so for the adults involved that for me, because I was still a little kid and I just sort of accepted it. Now that I'm an adult, it just means a lot to me that I still have this beatiful relationshop with Todd. He did a wonderful thing for me."
Liv on Todd: "I would go to sleep at night and I would up at like six in the morning and creep up the little steps to the tower where he would be on his computer. I would just sit there."

=======================================================
Liv Tyler was raised as Liv Rundgren by her mom Bebe Buell and rock artist Todd Rundgren. She learned later in her life that her biological father was actually Steven Tyler of Aerosmith. When Liv was 14 she moved with her mom from Portland, Maine to New York City where she began modeling when she was 15. She quickly tired of modeling and decided to give acting a shot.
Liv Tyler started her career with a starring role in her dad's music video Crazy with Alicia Silverstone. Her big screen break came easily when she landed a leading role in 1995's Empire Records. From there she snagged roles in Silent Fall (1995), Stealing Beauty (1996) and Inventing the Abbotts (1997.) Liv Tyler got her fair share of press when she dated (her co-star from Inventing the Abbotts) actor Joaquin Phoenix for almost three years. 
Liv Tyler starred as Ben Affleck's love in the Bruce Willis action hit Armageddon. Her dad, Steven Tyler got in on the flick when Aerosmith contributed the love theme. Liv Tyler's biggest movie role has got to be her part as the elvin princess, Arwen, in the mythical fantasy trilogy based on  The Lord of the Rings books.
Liv Tyler was named after actress Liv Ullmann, who was on the cover of TV Guide the week Liv Tyler was born.
"I cried on my 18th birthday. I thought 17 was such a nice age. You're young enough to get away with things, but you're old enough, too."

Possessing an unusual beauty marked by perhaps the most distinctive set of lips in the business (an inheritance from father Steven Tyler), Liv Tyler unsurprisingly made her entrance into acting via the world of modeling. Since her breakthrough role in 1996's Stealing Beauty, she has emerged as a performer with bona fide talent, dropping her "model-actress" hyphenate in favor of just "actress."Born in Portland, ME, on July 1, 1977, to model and former 1970s rock groupie Bebe Buell, Tyler spent most of her youth believing that rocker Todd Rundgren was her father. However, as she grew older, she began to notice more than a passing resemblance between herself and Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler, who was a family friend, and she ultimately discovered that he was indeed her biological father. When she was 12, she took Tyler's last name as her own.After experiencing obligatory preteen awkwardness -- hers featured braces and a bit of a weight problem -- Tyler had blossomed enough by the time she was 14 to consider modeling. She moved to New York City in the company of her mother and began to pursue a career. After appearing on the covers of magazines like Seventeen and Mirabella, Tyler got her first taste of acting while filming a television commercial. She made her film debut in 1994, as the sister of an autistic boy in Bruce Beresford's Silent Fall, appearing in the mystery alongside Richard Dreyfuss and Linda Hamilton.Following this fairly auspicious debut, Tyler's next project, 1995's Empire Records, proved a disappointment on both commercial and critical levels. Tyler kept at it, next starring as the unrequited love interest of a reclusive pizza maker (Pruitt Taylor Vince) in James Mangold's Heavy that same year. Her work in the critically hailed film won her wide praise and her career began to take off. Tyler's breakthrough came the following year in Bernardo Bertolucci's Stealing Beauty. Starring as a 19-year-old who comes to Italy to find her father and lose her virginity, she suddenly became Hollywood's new "It" Girl, appearing on magazine covers and as one of People's "50 Most Beautiful" in 1997.After a lead as one of the titular Abbott sisters in Inventing the Abbotts (1997) and a brief cameo in U-Turn the same year, Tyler stepped into the realm of bloated budgets and even more bloated box-office returns with her role as Bruce Willis' daughter and Ben Affleck's girlfriend in Armageddon (1998). The following year, she returned to the art house circuit with Robert Altman's Cookie's Fortune. The film was widely praised, as was its ensemble cast, which included Tyler, Glenn Close, Julianne Moore, Charles S. Dutton, Chris O'Donnell, and Ned Beatty. The same year, Tyler lent her talents to the 18th century road movie genre, starring opposite Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller in Plunkett and Macleane. She also had a leading role as the object of Ralph Fiennes' jaded affections in Martha Fiennes' Onegin, which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival.After taking the role of an irresistibly destructive seductress in the 2001 comedy One Night at McCool's, Tyler took another trip back in time, this time putting her pixyish beauty to ideal use as Arwen, an elf faced with the daunting dilemma of choosing between love and immortality in director Peter Jackson's grandiose, three-film adaptation of J.R.R. Tolken's Lord of the Rings. She was the love interest for Benn Affleck in Kevin Smith's Jersey Girl. In 2007 she stretched her dramatic range in Mike Binder's Reign Over Me, and the next year played the love interest of Dr. Banner in The Incredible Hulk, and also took the lead in the home-invasion thriller The Strangers. She was the love interest for a frustrated wannabe superhero in James Gunn's Super in 2010, and the next year she had a major part in the thriller The Ledge. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi

"I have these slumber parties with my father [Aerosmith's Steve Tyler], and when we can't sleep we stay up all night trading beauty tips. He knows all about the good creams and masks." - Liv Tyler
                Daughter of Steven Tyler, lead singer of the rock band Aerosmith, Liv Tyler's movie credits include  Armageddon (1998), the Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively), Jersey Girl (2004), and The Incredible Hulk (2008).  
                Liv Tyler's lips -- they're like beacons of sexuality. It's amazing to look at Liv Tyler (not only because of her remarkable resemblance to her father Steven) and wonder if she couldn't have been the next Cindy Crawford.  The funny thing is that she used to be a chubby, awkward kid with braces. She should be recast in the latest re-telling of The Ugly Duckling.            
                Her movie career is in full swing, and although Armageddon and The Incredible Hulk were her most high-profile roles, she also appeared in Tom Hank's That Thing You Do! (1996), Inventing the Abbotts (1997), Dr. T and the Women (2000), Lonesome Jim (2005), Reign Over Me (2007), Smother (2007), and The Strangers (2008).  She has been nominated 13 times for awards related to her acting, of which she has taken home seven, including a Screen Actor's Guild Award.            
                Liv Tyler was born July 1, 1977, in Portland, Maine.  Her unique first name came about after her mother, model and former rock groupie Bebe Buell, saw Liv Ullmann on the cover of a TV Guide  the week Liv was born.  As for the roots of her last name, Liv always believed that her father was musician Todd Rundgren, with whom her mother had a long-term relationship, as he helped raise her.  Although her birth certificate stated that Rundgren was indeed her father, a 10-year-old Liv became suspicious after meeting Aerosmith's Steven Tyler at a Rundgren concert, and even more suspicious after seeing Steven Tyler's daughter Mia Tyler, who could have passed for Liv's twin, at an Aerosmith concert.  Liv confronted her mother about the topic, and her mother told her the truth: Steven Tyler was her father (Liv was the product of an eight-month relationship between Tyler and Buell). liv tyler in aerosmith's crazy video  Liv Tyler made her biological father's name her own at the age of 12, and two years later, mother and daughter headed to New York.  While Liv Tyler grew into a statuesque, blue-eyed beauty (she had her father's unmistakable pouty, Mick Jagger-like lips), she claims she was chubby and awkward while growing up.  Family friend Paulina Porizkova saw the beauty in Liv Tyler (as does everyone today), and encouraged her to start modeling.  Liv Tyler did, and she soon appeared in magazines such as Seventeen, YM and Mirabella.  However, modeling eventually became boring, and Liv Tyler wanted to start acting. She was offered a part in the 1994 film Silent Fall, which came and went quietly, and she was also cast as Callie in 1995's Heavy.  Liv Tyler also starred in the 1995 bomb Empire Records, which was set in a record store, but she did attract attention while costarring with Alicia Silverstone in dad's video for Crazy. liv tyler in stealing beauty and armageddon  Finally in 1996, Liv Tyler landed the lead role of Lucy in Bernardo Bertolucci's exquisite film about a teen in search of finding her father and losing her virginity, Stealing Beauty.  Although the film was not a moneymaker, it did raise eyebrows in film circles, especially at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival.  After a starring role in Tom Hanks' film That Thing You Do!, Liv Tyler was cast in 1997's Inventing the Abbotts. She costarred with Joaquin Phoenix in Inventing the Abbots, and the pair embarked a two-year romantic relationship.  After a tiny role in U Turn and an uncredited role in Can't Hardly Wait, Liv Tyler starred as Bruce Willis' daughter in the summer blow-up hit Armageddon, which opened on her birthday.  In 1999, Liv Tyler rounded out a stellar cast in Cookie's Fortune, appeared in Plunkett & Macleane, costarred with Ralph Fiennes in Onegin, and appeared as herself in the documentary Franky Goes to Hollywood. liv tyler in lord of the rings trilogy  Liv Tyler starred in the female star-studded Dr. T and the Women (along with fellow celebrity progeny Kate Hudson), and was next seen in the comedy One Night at McCool's, as the scheming Jewel Valentine.   Next up for Liv Tyler was the first installment of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, in which she played Arwen Undomiel. She was recast in the second the third installments of the trilogy: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the Ring.  In 2003, Liv Tyler married her boyfriend of three years, British rocker Royston Langdon from the group Spacehog, in a small ceremony in Barbados. She was also named the spokesmodel for Givenchy.  Jersey Girl (2004) and Lonesome Jim (2005) with Casey Affleck were the two projects that followed for Liv Tyler. Also in 2004, Liv Tyler gave birth to her first child, a baby boy named Milo William Langdon. liv tyler in the incredible hulk In 2006, Liv Tyler had a brief hiatus from acting, only to return in 2007 with Reign Over Me, costarring Adam Sandler, Jada Pinkett Smith and Saffron Burrows.
