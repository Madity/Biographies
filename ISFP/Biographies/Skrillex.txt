Sonny John Moore (born January 15, 1988), better known by his stage name Skrillex, is an American electronic musician and singer-songwriter. Growing up in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Sonny Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007.[1][2] He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual "100 Bands You Need to Know" issue.[3]
After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex, distributing the My Name Is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page. Subsequently, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late–2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid–2011, both of which have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: "Best Dance/Electronica Album", "Best Dance Recording", and "Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical".[4] On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll.[5] On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year.[6] Skrillex has won a total of six Grammy Awards.
Moore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles,[7][8] but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of 2, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of 9 and 10, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the time he was 12, his family moved back to his birthplace of northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts. Later he was home schooled at the age of 14 due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted[9] and dropped out of the program when he was 16.[10][11] While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later at electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods.[12][13]
In 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu.
Moore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos ("Signal", "Equinox", and "Glow Worm"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building. After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in "baby blue envelopes", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate.
In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards. On April 7, 2009, he released Gypsyhook EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of "Mora" entitled "海水" ("Kaisui"). Physical copies of the EP were available at his shows. After going on tour with Innerpartysystem and Paper Route and opening for Chiodos on their European tour, Moore performed at Bamboozle on May 2. He performed on Bamboozle Left's Saints and Sinners stage on April 4. He toured with Hollywood Undead in April 2009 performing under the band name Sonny and the Blood Monkeys, with Chris Null (electric guitar), Sean Friday (drums, percussion & beats) and Aaron Rothe (keyboards, synthesizers, programming & turntables). Moore has stated that the album Bells will not be released.[14]
In 2008, Moore began producing and performing under the alias Skrillex at clubs in the Los Angeles area.[citation needed] Previously, he had been known on the Internet as Twipz.[citation needed] On June 7, 2010, Moore released his official Skrillex debut EP, My Name Is Skrillex as a free download.[15] Moore provided programming and vocals for UK metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon on their third studio album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret.[16] Later in the year, Sonny began a nationwide tour with Deadmau5 after being signed to mau5trap recordings and released his second EP, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites.
Moore kicked off the "Project Blue Book Tour" in 2011 with support from Porter Robinson, Tommy Lee and DJ Aero as well as appearances from Sofia Toufa for a new song titled "Bring Out the Devil". Skrillex unveiled several new songs on this tour including "First of the Year" (formerly known as "Equinox"), "Reptile", and "Cinema" (remix of a Benny Benassi track). "Reptile" was featured in the TV commercial for Mortal Kombat 9, and "First of the Year (Equinox)" is featured on his follow up EP and remix companion to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, titled More Monsters and Sprites. In April 2011, Spin magazine premiered "Get Up", an exclusive new track from Korn that was produced by Skrillex. Korn made "Get Up" available for free download via their Facebook page.[17] On April 15, 2011 KoRn joined Skrillex on stage for his set at Coachella 2011. On April 18, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) development studio Naughty Dog released a trailer[18] for the multiplayer component of their PlayStation 3 game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, featuring "Kill EVERYBODY" from Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites.
In June 2011, "More Monsters and Sprites" was released on Beatport, an EP consisting of three original tracks, including "First of the Year (Equinox)" and two versions of his original track "Ruffneck". A leaked track entitled "Ruffneck Bass" had been leaked on the internet months prior which used the same sample as in the new "Ruffneck" tracks on the EP. Skrillex released a music video for "Rock n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain)" on his official YouTube page on June 20, 2011.[19] On August 17, 2011 Skrillex announced his label, OWSLA.[20] "The label's first releases will come from Bristol-based dubstep producers KOAN Sound, electro-house newcomer Porter Robinson from North Carolina, singer/songwriter Alvin Risk, and San Francisco-based M Machine (formally Metropolis)."[21] Skrillex released a music video for "First of the Year (Equinox)" via Spin.com on August 19, 2011. In late August 2011 it was released that he would be appearing Knife Party's first release, collaborating on a Moombahton style track entitled "Zoology". A preview was released on YouTube. In late September 2011 he created the track "Syndicate" as promotion for the video game of the same name. Kaskade's 2011 album Fire & Ice features a collaboration between Kaskade and Skrillex entitled "Lick It". The video for Skrillex's song "First of the Year (Equinox)" appears on the first episode of the Beavis and Butt-head revival.
On November 8, Skrillex stated that he intended to release an album entitled Voltage. Skrillex gave fans more info about Voltage in RockSound Magazine after a photoshoot for the cover and doing an extensive interview on his tour.[22] For unknown reasons, however, the album was never released, however on December 21, 2011, Skrillex unveiled the Bangarang EP for a Beatport release on December 23, then on August 12, 2012, his new side-project formed with Boys Noize called Dog Blood released an EP called Next Order/Middle Finger. On November 6, 2012, Skrillex released a limited edition triple vinyl box set.[23] Skrillex composed the song "Bug Hunt" for the 2012 animated film Wreck-It Ralph, as well as making a brief cameo as a DJ in the film's first act, and in December 2012, "Make It Bun Dem" is used in as a looped variant during the single player mission 'Kick the Hornets Nest' in the video game Far Cry 3.
Skrillex confirmed at a show in January 2013 that he will release a new LP in the summer.[24] On January 2, 2013, Skrillex released his 7th EP, Leaving, on the OWSLA subscription service, Nest IV.[25] He later released the single "Try It Out" with Alvin Risk.
On March 7, 2014, an App titled "Alien Ride" was put up on Apple's App Store which contained a secret folder with 11 hidden objects and a countdown ending March 10 at 6:30EST. Moore's website was updated with the App's picture on the front page and it was later revealed the folder contains Google Play and iTunes url's which eventually were revealed to be 11 new songs available to stream that comprised his debut LP, titled Recess. The album was made available for pre-order at midnight and was released on March 18, 2014.
Moore has stated in an online interview that he has been a longtime fan of Warp, an electronic music label that has released recordings from artists such as Aphex Twin and Squarepusher.[26]
In February 2012, Rolling Stone[27] reported that Skrillex was dating the artist and singer Ellie Goulding, who provided vocals for the track "Summit" on the Bangarang EP.[28] In late October 2012 the couple had split up, citing an inability to make their long distance relationship work.[29]
At his birthday party in January 2013, Skrillex's hair caught on fire and the incident was caught on video. He was unharmed.[30]

For some it is a story of baffling multiples. They struggle to comprehend how thousands of singles sold each day to the tens of thousands crushing into venues every week can be so easily dwarfed by the hundreds of thousands downloading, bootlegging, remixing and uploading for a content hungry global audience that devours petabytes of data while contributing billions of views and listens through platforms like YouTube.
Others stumble on the scale and speed of achievement. Perplexed that it is possible for an artist to go from gifting music online to receiving an ovation from his peer group just twenty-four months later as three Grammy Awards are placed in his hands.
Some get hung up on the apparent ease and freedom of it all. Bewildered that someone can galvanise and ignite multiple genres of music with songs entirely written, recorded and mixed on a single laptop loaded with software and synths available to absolutely anyone with a credit card and internet connection.
But for Sonny Moore, someone you may know better as Skrillex, none of this troubles him greatly. The 24-year-old electronic imagineer focuses on little more than the story of community, creativity and commitment that has taken him from warehouse parties in Los Angeles to a defining role in the modern zeitgeist.
“To be honest my vibe gets killed the most when I’m concentrating too much on what is around me and thinking too much about it all,” Moore states. “I have the most fun when I let my mind check out, right at that point things just start to happen.”
It started to go well for Sonny when he filtered out the noise and distraction of his world as a solo artist and started mining the ephemeral moments he had been sharing with friends in clubs and parties across the city he calls home since his mid-teen years. The restless, urgent and kaleidoscopic sounds of EDM and bass music had spoken to him for the best part of a decade, one day he just started talking back.
“Making music is the same as DJing,” he offers. “You continue along the path that leaves you most inspired. When you think too much you put limits on what is possible, the best parts are always instinctual rather than something too considered or planned out.”
Now with shimmering LED walls, 3D light shows, pyrotechnics and a relentless thirst to create live experiences of ever-increasing drama and spectacle, the challenge is to keep the fluidity and flexibility that hallmarked and aided his swift ascent. How is he doing it? By redefining the very nature of the phenomenon he now helms.
“Skrillex is a band when it comes to performing live these days,” he admits. “Whatever room or arena we are in everyone is fully in the moment. My lighting and video guys are all working in real time while I’m onstage and the best compliment I get after a set is when someone asks about how I pre-program my set or use midi to get the audio/visual experience so tight. I love what we create because at any given moment everything could change. The people I have working with me are all so musical, we just create a vibe and feed offit along with everyone else in the club. It feels like a band jamming together most nights, but instead of the typical instruments we have lights, decks, LED, cryogenics and fire.” 
Moore and his crew have taken Ableton project files and made multimedia art. Skrillex is fast becoming a form of hyper-digital jazz that values the improvised and unknown while creating electronic storms of devastating force and almost unimaginable size. 
“On our side of the show we have walls of lights and visuals, computers, software, hardware and firmware but that’s just the beginning. The entire crowd is playing a part with all the cameras, cell phones and social networks,” Moore laughs. “I wonder what all the data in the room even looks like when we are all firing.”
“I’m always chasing that moment when you actually feel time stop,” he continues. “Every now and then you get a second where it feels possible to step outside your own head and see what everyone else is experiencing. It usually happens to me in the most intense visceral moments when I’m playing to 40,000 people in the open air or in a tiny club where the walls are sweating, it’s crazy but I love it.”
And that’s the key, loving but not over-thinking the madness that surrounds. Not dwelling on the numbers and riding, rather than watching, the swelling wave that is driving you forward. “It feels like being on a rollercoaster right now,” Moore confesses. “It’s exhilarating as it builds and builds and builds. When your stomach rises up into your throat I think all you can really do is smile. That’s my plan anyway.”

Sonny John Moore (born January 15, 1988), professionally known as Skrillex, is an American electronic musician from Los Angeles, California, well known for his role as the former frontman for the post-hardcore band From First to Last. On February 27, 2007, Moore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. Moore made several demo albums available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These albums were tour exclusive, and were packaged in "baby blue envelopes", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate. In 2008, Moore began DJing under the alias Skrillex at clubs in the Los Angeles area. On June 7, 2010, Moore released his official Skrillex debut EP, “My Name is Skrillex.” On April 7, 2009, he released “Gypsyhook” EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of "Mora" entitled "Kai Sui". Physical copies of the EP were available at his shows. In the summer of 2010, Moore provided programming and vocals for English metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon on their third studio album “There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret.” Later in the year, Sonny released his second EP, “Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites.”A third EP and first remix collection, "More Monsters and Sprites" consisting of three new tracks and four additional remixes of the title track from his previous EP, was released in 2011.
=======================================================
        Sonny Moore found club and mainstream stardom beginning in 2008, when he swapped his gig as post-hardcore frontman for From First to Last and created the dancefloor-oriented project Skrillex. He originally used the name for live DJ sets, but in 2009 the project moved into the studio with Skrillex remixing the likes of Lady Gaga (Bad Romance) and Snoop Dogg (Sensual Seduction). In 2010, the self-released digital download EP My Name Is Skrillex appeared, combining the Benny Benassi and Deadmau5 styles of electro with the over the top samples and giant noises of acts like the Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim. Moore would sign with Deadmau5s Mau5trap label that same year, where he would release his second EP, Scary Monsters & Nice Sprites, along with the club hit Kill Everybody. If topping the club charts didn't prove the producer had arrived, a 2011 appearance on the revived Beavis & Butthead television series did, along with his collaboration with the surviving members of the Doors called "Breakin' a Sweat." The recording of the track was captured in the documentary film RE:GENERATION, while the song itself landed on Skrillex's Bangarang EP, which appeared in early 2012. ~ David Jeffries, Rovi

Language: English“I’ve been deep into electronic music my entire life. The first records I ever owned were ‘Fat of Land’ by the Prodigy and ‘Come To Daddy’ by Aphex Twin,” raves Sonny Moore, better known as emerging electronic visionary SKRILLEX. “Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails were also early influences. I’ve been dabbling in making electronic tracks on programs like Fruity Loops since I was 14 years old.”
SKRILLEX is part of a new generation of artists that refuse to be restricted by preconceived notions or outside expectations. “Genre has never been important to me,” he insists. “I’ve never thought about music that way.”
Describing his current sound as “a mix of dubstep, electro and glitch all thrown together,” new SKRILLEX release “SCARY MONSTERS AND NICE SPRITES” reflects all of the above and beyond. The uplifting post-trance synth melodies of “ALL I ASK OF YOU” (featuring the soaring vocals of Penny) stands in stark contrast to the face-melting electro bass blasts of the massive electro-dubstep hybrid “ROCK N’ ROLL (WILL TAKE YOU TO THE MOUNTAIN).”
“I’ve listened to so much music for so long, it’s more about instinct than influence,” Moore explains about his sonic inspirations. “Coming up, I was into a lot of artists on the Warp record label like Autechre, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin, so SKRILLEX tracks are inclined to have more changes than most dance tracks normally have. I can draw influences from almost anything. I just like to mess around and create cool new sounds and noises. I just go where the music takes me.”
After just one hugely successful independent release, “SCARY MONSTERS AND NICE SPRITES” is the first SKRILLEX release on Big Beat Records, in conjunction with fellow electronic revolutionary Deadmau5’s freshly minted Mau5trap record label.
“For years, the artists needed the record labels. I don’t feel that way at all,” Moore stresses. “SKRILLEX has been 100% independent until now. I think it’s so important to be self-sufficient as an artist. Working with Atlantic / Big Beat, and cooperating with Mau5trap, allows us all to work as a team and expand on what’s already been built.”
Following its release on Beatport, the 9-song EP dominated the charts on the site, with the title track claiming the site’s #1 slot (the first time a dubstep track has ever done so), 8 songs breaking into the top 10, and multiple tracks claiming the #1 slots on several of the site’s subgenre charts, including Dubstep, Electro House, Progressive House.
Aside from the immediate success of “SCARY MONSTERS AND NICE SPRITES,” SKRILLEX has also made a name for himself as a highly sought-after remixer. He’s already produced officially commissioned remixes for such A-list artists as the Black Eyed Peas (“Rock That Body”), Lady Gaga (“Bad Romance” and “Alejandro”), and La Roux (“In For The Kill”).
SKRILLEX stands not only at the vanguard of electronic dance music, but the perpetually evolving new music industry as a whole.
“For me, it’s important to believe in and love the music you’re making. I gave away my first EP on my manager’s website, just so people could hear the music,” he enthuses. “It was downloaded by the thousands in just a couple of months, and it hasn’t let up since. That’s all the inspiration I need to keep making music.
“SKRILLEX can be anything I want it to be,” he continues hopefully. “There are so many different avenues for music now. Video games, movie scores — the possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to be a part of it.”

=======================================================
                                   Born January 15th, 1988, Skrillex (then Sonny Moore) got into music at an early age and started attending punk rock shows and electro rave gigs. Between 2004 and 2007, he found success as the lead singer for screamo band, From First to Last. However, vocal problems forced him to quit and Moore then pursued a solo career exploring electronic music. He made his debut as Skrillex in 2010, making a name for himself in the dubstep community with his own music and by producing for other artists. He won 3 Grammys in 2012. In this video, WatchMojo.com takes a look at the musical origins of Skrillex.

                        This artist successfully made the move from hardcore to dance floor. Welcome to WatchMojo.com, and today we’re taking a look at the musical origins of Skrillex.
Sonny John Moore was born January 15th, 1988 and raised in San Francisco, California.  When he was 12, his family moved back to his birthplace of Los Angeles where he spent a few years attending a performing arts school.  In his mid-teens, he dropped out and learned he was adopted.  
During this period, Moore also frequented underground punk rock concerts and electro club raves.  These two styles later influenced his musical career.
In 2004, he auditioned to be a guitarist for the post-hardcore band From First to Last, but was recruited as lead singer instead.  Their full-length debut, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, dropped that same year.  That metal, hardcore punk and emo effort placed within the top twenty of the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart.
Following several successful tours, From First to Last released Heroine in 2006.  When the record sold over 200 thousand units, it became the band’s best-selling album, and even reached the twenty fifth position on the Billboard 200.  They soon signed with major label Capitol Records and took part in a series of profitable tours.
However, things took a turn for the worse: Moore contracted health issues that required vocal cord surgery and eventually forced the band off the road.  Ironically, that turned out to be a blessing in disguise for this young musician.
In 2007, Moore left From First to Last to focus on his solo career.  He then began releasing demo songs online and playing gigs with a full band on several tours.
Within two years, he released his first digital EP Gypsyhook under the name Sonny Moore.  That year, he also performed under the band name Sonny and the Blood Monkeys.
Meanwhile, Moore also began producing music for himself and for other artists.  He made his debut as electronic music producer Skrillex in 2010 with the release of the dubstep EP My Name is Skrillex.  That same year, he worked with metalcore group Bring Me the Horizon and toured with Deadmau5.  
Skrillex was also signed to the popular house DJ and producer’s label, mau5trap Records, and it was that outfit that released Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites.  That dubstep EP managed to chart within the top fifty of the Billboard 200 and was eventually certified gold.  It also helped put Skrillex on the mainstream radar.
Skrillex followed his second release with his first remix album, More Monsters and Sprites.  The 2011 EP included the single “First of the Year (Equinox),” which was accompanied by a Grammy-nominated music video.  
Also in 2011, Skrillex launched his own record label and collaborated with artists such as nu metal band Korn, electro-house duo Knife Party and DJ/Producer Kaskade.
By the end of that year, Skrillex released Bangarang.  That EP featured collaborations with artists like The Doors, Kill the Noise and Ellie Goulding.  Not only did it manage to reach the Billboard 200 top twenty, it also topped the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart.
In 2012, the industry and the mainstream took notice of this up-and-comer when he was awarded three Grammy Awards at the 54th annual ceremony.  Unfortunately, that recognition also earned him the ire of the underground, and he was labeled by some as “the most hated man in dubstep.”  Despite that, he was still considered one of the most exciting new acts to debut in years, and he continued touring, producing for other acts and releasing new music.
Even though he is relatively new to the genre, Skrillex’s ability as a dub-step/electro-house producer is apparent.  He is ranked among the best in the biz, and is often compared to electronic music heavyweights like David Guetta and Deadmau5.  With his impressive résumé and awards already piling up, Skrillex is most certainly a force to be reckoned with.
