Sofia Carmina Coppola (/ˈkoʊpələ/ KOH-pə-lə; born May 14, 1971)[1] is an American screenwriter, director, producer and actress. In 2003, she received the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for Lost in Translation, and became the third woman (and first American woman) to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director. In 2010, with Somewhere, she became the first American woman (and fourth American filmmaker) to win the Golden Lion, the top prize at the Venice Film Festival.[2]
Sofia Coppola was born in New York City, New York, the youngest child and only daughter of set decorator/artist Eleanor Coppola (née Neil) and director Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather, Apocalypse Now). She is also granddaughter of the composer Carmine Coppola, sister of Roman Coppola and Gian-Carlo Coppola, niece of her father's siblings August Coppola and Talia Shire, and a cousin of Nicolas Cage, Jason Schwartzman, and Robert Schwartzman.[citation needed]
When Coppola was 14, her brother Gian-Carlo was killed in a boating accident.[citation needed] At 15, she interned with Chanel.[3] Coppola is a 1989 graduate of the St. Helena High School. She later attended Mills College and the California Institute of the Arts.[4] After dropping out of college, Coppola started a clothing line called Milkfed, which is now sold exclusively in Japan.[5]
Coppola's acting career, marked by frequent criticisms related to nepotism,[6][7][8] began while she was an infant, as she made background appearances in seven of her father's films. The best known of these early roles is her appearance in The Godfather as the baby boy in the baptism scene.[9][10] Coppola returned to her father's trilogy in both the second and third Godfather films, playing Michael Corleone's daughter in the latter after the original actress Winona Ryder discontinued her involvement with the film.[11][12] Coppola responded to a question about her role in The Godfather Part III in a 2013 interview:
Let's see. Did I not wanna do it? Um. I was game. I was trying different things. It sounded better than college. I didn't really think about the public aspect of it. That took me by surprise. The whole reaction. People felt very attached to the Godfather films. I grew up with them being no big deal. I mean, I understand they're great films but … I dunno. I'm not surprised. It makes sense that people would have an opinion about it but I got a lot of attention I wasn't expecting. I was going to art school anyway so I was able to get back to what I was doing. It was before the internet so magazines would come out but then the next month they were gone. There wasn't even as much paparazzi around then.[11]
Coppola also acted in her father's films The Outsiders (1983), in a scene where Matt Dillon, Tommy Howell, and Ralph Macchio are eating at a Dairy Queen, Rumble Fish (1983), The Cotton Club (1984), and as Kathleen Turner's sister Nancy Kelcher in Peggy Sue Got Married (1986).[12]
Frankenweenie (1984) was the first film that she performed in that was not associated with her father; however, it often goes unnoted due to her stage name "Domino", which she adopted at the time because she thought it was glamorous.[13] The 1989 short film, entitled Life Without Zoe, was released as part of a tripartite anthology film New York Stories, and was co-written by a teenage Coppola with her father, who also directed the film.[14]
After she was critically panned for her performance in The Godfather Part III, for which she was named "Worst Supporting Actress" and "Worst New Star" at the 1990 Golden Raspberry Awards, Coppola ended her acting career; although, she appeared in the 1992 independent film Inside Monkey Zetterland, as well as in the backgrounds of films by her friends and family; for example, she appeared as Saché in George Lucas' Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace in 1999.[11] She has since been quoted as saying that she was not hurt by the criticism from her role in The Godfather Part III, because she never especially wanted an acting career.[15]
Coppola also appears in several music videos from the 1990s: The Black Crowes' "Sometimes Salvation"; Sonic Youth's "Mildred Pierce"; Madonna's "Deeper and Deeper"; the Chemical Brothers' "Elektrobank", which was directed by her future husband Spike Jonze; and later Phoenix's "Funky Squaredance".[11]
Coppola's first short-film was Lick the Star (1998). It played many times on the Independent Film Channel. She made her feature-film directing debut with The Virgin Suicides (1999). It premiered in North America at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival and was released later that year.
Her second feature was Lost in Translation (2003). Coppola won the Academy Award for her original screenplay and three Golden Globe Awards including Best Picture Musical or Comedy. After Lina Wertmüller and Jane Campion, Coppola became the third female director to be nominated for an Academy Award for Directing and the second to win the Original Screenplay award, after Campion in 1994 (Wertmüller was also nominated), thus making a pattern for the female directors to be nominated for both awards. Her win for best original screenplay in 2003 made her a third-generation Oscar winner. In 2004, Coppola was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[16]
Her third film was the biopic Marie Antoinette, adapted from the biography by British historian Antonia Fraser. Kirsten Dunst plays the title character, who marries King Louis XVI, played by Jason Schwartzman, Coppola's cousin. It debuted at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival[17] where, despite boos in the audience, it received a standing ovation.[18] Critics were divided.
Her fourth film was Somewhere (2010). The movie was filmed at Chateau Marmont. The plot focuses on a "bad boy" actor portrayed by Stephen Dorff who is forced to reevaluate his life when his daughter, played by Elle Fanning, arrives unexpectedly.[19] In November 2010, Coppola was interviewed by Joel Coen, who professed his admiration of Coppola's work, at the DGA screening of Somewhere in New York City.[20]
Coppola's most recent film is The Bling Ring. It is based on actual events centered around the Bling Ring, a group of California teenagers who burgled the homes of several celebrities over 2008 and 2009, stealing around $3 million in cash and belongings.[21] Emma Watson,[22] Taissa Farmiga,[23] Leslie Mann,[24] Katie Chang, Claire Julien and Israel Broussard are starring in the film. The film opened the Un Certain Regard section of the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.[25]
An announcement in mid-December 2013 stated that American Zoetrope had successfully attained the screen rights for the memoir Fairyland: A Memoir of My Father and that Coppola will adapt the book with Andrew Durham. Coppola will also produce the film with her brother Roman.[25]
In March of 2014 it was reported that Coppola was in negotiations to direct a live-action adaptation of The Little Mermaid from a script by Caroline Thompson.[26]
In the mid-1990s, she and best friend Zoe Cassavetes helmed the short-lived series Hi Octane on Comedy Central which spotlit performers in underground music. The show was cancelled after four episodes.[27]
In December 2008, Coppola's first commercial premiered during an episode of Gossip Girl. The advertisement which she directed for the Christian Dior fragrance Miss Dior Chérie which was shot in France with model Maryna Linchuk was very well received and continues to be popular on YouTube.[28]
At the beginning of the 1990s, she was often featured in girl-oriented magazines like Seventeen and YM. In 1998, she cofounded the clothing line Milk Fed in Japan with friend Stephanie Hayman in cooperation with Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon.
In 2002, fashion designer Marc Jacobs hand-picked the actress/director to be the face of his house's fragrance. The campaign involved photographs of her shot by photographer Juergen Teller in his signature grainy style.
In the July 2013 issue of Elle Magazine, photographs shot by Coppola of Paris Hilton at her Beverly Hills mansion (which makes a cameo in The Bling Ring) were featured.[29]
Coppola was nominated for three Academy Awards for her 2003 film Lost in Translation, in the categories of Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay. She would go on to win for Best Original Screenplay, but lost the other two nominations to Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.
Her nomination for Best Director made her the first American woman in history to be nominated in that category, and the third overall, after Lina Wertmüller and Jane Campion. In 2010, Kathryn Bigelow became the fourth woman to be nominated, and the first to win the award. Coppola, however, remains the youngest woman to be nominated in the Best Director category.
Her win for Best Original Screenplay resulted in her family becoming the second three-generation Oscar winning family, her grandfather Carmine Coppola and her father Francis Ford Coppola having previously won Oscars. The first family to achieve this feat was the Huston family: Walter, John, and Anjelica.
For her work on Lost in Translation, Coppola also won a Best Screenplay Golden Globe and received a BAFTA nomination.
On September 11, 2010, Somewhere won the Golden Lion, the top prize at the 67th Venice Film Festival.[30]
In 1999, Coppola married director Spike Jonze, whom she had first met in 1992, and they divorced in 2003. It is widely believed that a minor character in Lost In Translation is based on Jonze, as Coppola stated after the film's release, "There are elements of Spike there, elements of experiences."[31][32] In an official statement, Coppola's publicist explained that the divorce decision was reached "with sadness."
Coppola lives in Paris, France with her second husband Thomas Mars (lead singer of the French band Phoenix), and has described her love for the city and her favorite places there: "The Palais-Royal, the Tuileries Garden, the Musée d'Orsay. You can tell I love the city, right? It's a filmmaker's dream there; the colors are beautiful!"[33] On November 28, 2006, Coppola gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Romy, who is named in honor of her brother Roman.[34]
Coppola first met Mars while producing the soundtrack to The Virgin Suicides.[35] They have since collaborated on Lost in Translation, Marie Antoinette and Somewhere.[36]
A second daughter named Cosima was born to Coppola and Mars in New York City, U.S. in May 2010.[37] Coppola and Mars were married on August 27, 2011 at her family's villa ex "Palazzo Margherita"[38] in Bernalda, Italy.[39]

The daughter of Francis Ford Coppola, Sofia Coppola grew up in Northern California. She made her film debut playing baby Michael Francis Rizzi in her father's film The Godfather (1972). At two years of age, she made an appearance in The Godfather Part II (1974) as a child on a steamship. Over the next few years she appeared in four more of her father's films, including The Outsiders (1983), Rumble Fish (1983), The Cotton Club (1984) and Peggy Sue Got Married (1986). She landed a role in a short directed by Tim Burton and a small part in the feature film Anna (1987) directed by Yurek Bogayevicz, before replacing Winona Ryder in The Godfather Part III (1990). Unfortunately, she was awarded with two Razzie awards for her trouble: Worst New Star and Worst Supporting Actress. She made one more film appearance, in Inside Monkey Zetterland (1992), before realizing that rather than acting, she wanted to follow in her father's footsteps. She enrolled at the California Institute of the Arts to study Fine Arts. 
Her first film was a short that she wrote and directed, called Lick the Star (1998). She made her feature film directing debut with her own screenplay, The Virgin Suicides (1999), starring Hayden Christensen (pre-Star Wars Episode II), Josh Hartnett and Kirsten Dunst. Directing seemed to be the right choice for Sofia, as she won a Young Hollywood Award for Best Director, as well as an MTV Movie Award for Best New Filmmaker. 
Coppola, whose cousin is Nicolas Cage, married fellow director Spike Jonze in 1999, then wrote, produced and directed her next feature film, Lost in Translation(2003), a romantic comedy starring Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. Coppola won a Golden Globe for her screenplay, as well the Lina Mangiacapre Award at the Venice Film Festival for the film. She also received Best Director and Best Original Screenplay nods at the 2004 Academy Awards, winning the Best Original Screenplay Oscar.  
In 2003, Coppola and Jonze divorced. She went on to write and direct Marie Antoinette (2006), starring Kirsten Dunst, which won the Cinema Prize of the French National Education System at the Cannes Film Festival. 
Coppola's latest film, The Bling Ring, is based on the true story of a group of teenagers who robbed the Hollywood mansions of celebrities and stars Emma Watson.

      "You're considered superficial and silly if you are interested in fashion, but I think you can be substantial and still be interested in frivolity." - when discussing the topic of her movie, Marie Antoinette (2006).
      [on Marie Antoinette (2006)] All I can say is that I set out to challenge myself with each movie, and having to do a period film was a huge challenge. How to do it in a fresh way, and from the point of view of a strange girl in a strange world? If you attempt something new, it's always a risk.
      I was going to art school and trying different things. I was interested in a lot of, mostly visual arts. I didn't know what I wanted to do and then I made a short film and felt like it was a combination of all these interests of mine with design and photography and music. But it was really when I read the book The Virgin Suicides that made me wanna make a movie.
      [on Marie Antoinette (2006)] I was drawn to the idea of this girl being so young, and that our perceptions of Marie Antoinette, the myth, how she was turned into this villainous queen, are so different to the actual person, and she was just this kid that got sucked into a weird situation.
      We were always around my dad, so he wasn't absentee at all. I don't think it was normal, but it was exciting. You always had lots of creative people around, and my parents took us everywhere. I got exposed to so many different cultures and people. I mean, I got to go to Akira Kurosawa's house as a child.
      My dad came on the set of The Virgin Suicides (1999) and told me, "You should say 'Action' louder, more from your diaphragm." I thought, O.K., you can go now. I'm not going to say it wasn't intimidating, but when you direct is the only time you get to have the world exactly how you want it. My movies are very close to what I set out to do. And I'm superopinionated about what I do and don't like. I may say it differently, but I still get what I want.
      There's so many more female directors than when I started. That's encouraging. Maybe it's because it's such an all-encompassing job, and if you have a family, it's harder to do. But there are female surgeons. And there's plenty of women working in the film business.
      After seeing "Cinderella," [my daughter] Romy keeps telling me that she wants to be on the Broadway stage. I'm hoping she'll outgrow that. We'll see. Romy is in the Girl Scouts and I was around this group of 6-year-olds, and we were talking about things and a few of them said, 'I want to be famous.' I thought, Where does that come from? I don't think we knew about that when we were 6 years old.
      [on The Bling Ring (2013)] When I read the Vanity Fair [magazine] article about these kids, it summed up everything that I think is declining in our culture. And it just doesn't feel like anyone is talking about it. Kids are inundated with reality TV and tabloid culture so much that this just seems normal. When I go to a concert, everyone is filming and photographing themselves and then posting the pictures right away. It is almost as if your experiences don't count unless you have an audience watching them. There are even videos of kids having their sweet-16 birthdays and they want a red-carpet V.I.P. theme. This movie was about an extreme version of this...It frightens me, and it just seems like this trash culture is becoming acceptable as mainstream culture...I don't know if I would have been as interested in this if I didn't have daughters and know that they're growing up in this world. I think that's the way that it's affecting, because these are kids in the movie, they're so young and impressionable.
      My mom is very calm and quiet, so I think I got that from her. Because my dad is passionate and loud. ...It was always interesting and I really enjoyed that my parents always included us in their lives. So we got to be around all these interesting people and go on adventures. I mean there definitely were hard times...as a teenager losing my brother. He died in a boat accident when I was 15 and he was 22, and we were very close. I have one brother now, Roman. I think our family is so close because we would go on location with my dad sometimes, and we weren't around neighborhood kids and so we had to hang out with each other and be friends with each other.
      filmmaking choices] I feel like when I finish one, the next one is always a reaction to the one before. So after I did Marie Antoinette (2006), which was so decorative with so many characters, then I wanted to make Somewhere (2010) where it was just two characters, really simple. And then after that, which was so simple and slow paced, I felt in the mood to do this kind of gaudy, flashy, faster-paced one. But I feel like I'm usually just naturally drawn to something. I don't know what I want to do next, but I feel like doing something beautiful after this [The Bling Ring (2013)].
      [on Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)] It seems like it should be boring because it's these very long takes of her washing her dishes and doing these mundane things, but it's really fascinating because the actress [Delphine Seyrig] is so great. She's so natural.
Marie Antoinette (2006) was the only time I've worked more with a studio, so it was important for me to have creative freedom, I never get myself in a situation where I don't have creative freedom. I learned that from my dad: you put your heart into something, you have to protect it, what you're making. I always like to keep the budget as small as possible just to have the most freedom. You know you get left alone, you get to pick the actors you want to use. I like doing personal films, after doing a bigger movie, I enjoy doing smaller, intimate films. I've always written my own scripts, I really like doing everything from the beginning and taking it all the way through, I've probably learned that from my dad.
      I try to just make what I want to make or what I would want to see. I try not to think about the audience too much.
      There are always things that I wish were different, or I feel like I've made mistakes. But it's just part of it. I don't mind that it's a little homemade.
      My friend's 12-year-old son is really into Rick Ross, and I was like, "What's the most thug song that would be the most poseur-ish for this blond girl to be playing?"
      The movie I did before The Bling Ring (2013) was really slow and quiet, so I was just in the mood to do something obnoxious and faster, and something kind of in bad taste.
      The story of the Bling Ring seemed to say so much about what's happening in our culture today - all the interest in reality stars and kids posting pictures on Facebook all the time.
      People tell me how proud of me my father is. Now that I have a kid, I get it. She can make a little drawing and it's so exciting.

With Somewhere, 12-year-old Elle Fanning has put together a legacy of which any actor would be proud.
The Chateau Marmont, the setting of Sofia Coppola’s Somewhere, has a mythic reputation, as do a select few other hotels around the world.

Gender: Female Born: May 14, 1971 Birthplace: New York City, New York, USA Nationality: United States 
From All Movie Guide: Perhaps it makes sense that a woman whose earliest memory was on the set of Apocalypse Now would grow up to direct a dark fable about five adolescent girls who unapologetically and unceremoniously kill themselves, but for Sofia Coppola, the path to the director's chair was an uncertain one. Literally christened into a filmmaking career, the third child and only daughter of Francis Ford and Eleanor Coppola was born in Manhattan in the spring of 1971, during the production of her father's masterpiece, The Godfather. When it came time to shoot the baptism scene near the end of the film, the elder Coppola didn't have to look very far for an infant, and the epic became the impromptu actress' first, uncredited role. He found another bit part for the tiny Sofia in The Godfather Part II before her memorable experience on the tumultuous set of Apocalypse, as recorded in Eleanor's 1991 documentary of the making of the film, Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse. Coppola continued to pop up in her father's films in the early '80s and even ventured outside of the clan for a spot in 1987's Anna. It wasn't until father and daughter collaborated on a segment in the 1989 anthology film New York Stories, however, that Sofia began to attract critical attention -- albeit of a disparaging ilk. She and Francis co-wrote the half-hour children's fantasy Life Without Zoe in an attempt to evoke the glamorous, candy-colored world of the classic {-Eloise} children's tales. In her dual role as costume designer, the 17-year-old swathed the film's lead characters in lavish designer jewelry and threads. Unfortunately, the Coppola portion of the film almost universally bewildered critics, who found it too trifling for adults and too baffling for children. By then a high school graduate, Sofia retreated from the world of filmmaking and concentrated on fashion design, contributing her costuming talents to The Spirit of '76 (1990), a Dazed and Confused-style comedy co-written by her brother Roman.    Fate intervened, however, when cloudy circumstances forced Winona Ryder to bow out of Francis' much-anticipated The Godfather Part III. Sofia was swiftly cast in the role of Mary Corleone, and rumors regarding her acting chops -- or lack thereof -- began to swirl before she even shot a scene. When the film was released in late 1990, critics had a field day with her minor, but rather wooden, performance, finding it "hopelessly amateurish" and unintentionally comical. Even her aquiline profile became fodder for ridicule, and in March 1991, the Razzie Awards gave her the dubious distinction of Worst Supporting Actress as well as Worst New Star. Again, Coppola recoiled from Hollywood, entering the fine arts program at the California Institute of the Arts. There she began to nurture her interests in photography as well as costuming and experimented with video shorts. As their first post-graduate effort, she and some friends created the TV series High Octane, an offbeat news magazine on cable's Comedy Central network. The show was discontinued in 1994 after just four episodes, and Coppola continued to work on her brother's projects, primarily music videos. Around this time, Coppola read Jeffrey Eugenides' 1993 novel {-The Virgin Suicides} and was captivated by its dark, haunting take of adolescent sexuality. More significantly, she relished the challenge of translating the fervid, pubescent-male viewpoint of the book to the big screen, and she began writing her own screen adaptation of the text. Coppola was undaunted when she found that the rights to the book were already secured by Muse Productions, whose script was much more violent and overtly sexual than hers. Impressed with her work, Muse scrapped their version and backed Coppola. After securing a stellar cast -- including James Woods, Kathleen Turner, and Kirsten Dunst -- and the production assistance of her father, she began shooting the film in Toronto. When the finished work premiered in the Directors Fortnight of the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, the reception was an about-face from her previous run-ins with the press. Critics applauded Coppola's delicate, evocative handling of the tale, as well as her subtle, dream-like visual sense, aided by ace cinematographer Edward Lachman. Paramount Classics picked up the film for distribution in May 2000, when it received a brisk arthouse run.    In the summer of 1999, Coppola indoctrinated yet another filmmaker into her already distinguished clan of actors, composers, and auteurs when she married director Spike Jonze, whom she had met on the set of a Sonic Youth music video at the beginning of the decade. Jonze shot his first feature -- the critically acclaimed Being John Malkovich -- at the same time Coppola was helming her debut. Just as her husband was faced with the challenge of following up such a promising debut, Coppola too spent the years after The Virgin Suicides dabbling in TV production (on the ill-fated UPN hip-hop soap Platinum) and developing her sophomore feature. This time, however, she chose to fashion a screenplay not based on existing material but on her own experiences visiting Japan in her early twenties. The resulting character study, 2003's Lost in Translation, drew from a disparate set of memories: her father's work on a liquor ad with Akira Kurosawa in the mid-'70s, her memories of a former mentor in the fashion industry, and her own uncertainty over her future. Starring Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson as two similarly displaced, maritally dissatisfied Americans toiling away the hours in a posh Tokyo hotel, the film built upon Suicides' ethereal, deliberate pace and tone as it offered Murray one of the most textured, soulful roles of his career. An autumn arthouse smash that managed to cross over to mainstream audiences, Translation remained in theaters well into the new year, as the film, its director, and two leads were showered with accolades from critics' groups and industry organizations. After winning Golden Globes for Best Screenplay and Picture (Comedy or Musical), the young filmmaker took home the prize for Best Original Screenplay at the 2004 Academy Awards. Coppola also made history by becoming the first American woman to receive a Best Director Oscar nomination, though she ultimately lost the award to Peter Jackson.    Lost in Translation's success garnered attention of another sort: critics and audiences speculated that Coppola's marriage to Jonze was not-so-discreetly mirrored in one of Translation's plot threads -- the distant relationship between Johansson's character and her flighty photographer husband, played with a Jonze-like intensity by Giovanni Ribisi. Sure enough, Coppola and Jonze announced their divorce plans in December 2003, and the indie film world lost its nascent royal couple. After the mirrored triumphs of Suicides and Lost, rumors swirled in the trades surrounding Coppola's tertiary effort in the director's chair, which she announced as an adaptation of Antonia Fraser's historical novel {-Marie Antoinette: The Journey}. The 2006 period piece/costume drama starred Virgin lead Kirsten Dunst as the titular queen of France and archduchess of Austria, alongside a four-star cast highlighted by the presence of Jason Schwartzman (the director's cousin), Judy Davis, and the venerable Rip Torn as King Louis IV. She returned four years later with Somewhere a story about the relationship between a jaded actor played by Stephen Dorff and his young daughter. ~ Michael Hastings, Rovi

A few weeks after her birth, Coppola took on her first acting role: as an infant boy in her father's epic film, The Godfather (1972). Throughout her life, she continued to live and work under her father's wing, but his wing often cast a long shadow. In 2004 Coppola finally stepped out of that shadow to claim her own celebrity.

Sofia CoppolaFilmmakerBorn: 14 May 1971Birthplace: New York, New YorkBest known as: The writer and director of Lost in TranslationSofia Coppola is the writer and director of the critically acclaimed movies The Virgin Suicides (1999, starring Kirsten Dunst) and Lost in Translation (2003, starring Bill Murray). The daughter of legendary filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, Sofia Coppola got her start in the movies as an infant in The Godfather (1972). In her younger years she appeared as an actor in a number of her dad's movies, including The Outsiders and Rumble Fish (both 1983), The Cotton Club (1984, with Richard Gere) and Peggy Sue Got Married (1986, co-starring her cousin, Nicolas Cage). Her first movie as a writer/director, the somber The Virgin Suicides, proved that she was an able and mature filmmaker, and the sophistication of Lost in Translation (which earned her an Oscar for best original screenplay) made it clear she was an up-and-coming force in the movies. (Lost in Translation also made a star of Scarlett Johansson, who played a young American who shares a sleep-deprived week in Tokyo with a dissatisfied movie star played by Bill Murray.) Sofia Coppola's next film, Marie Antoinette, debuted at Cannes in 2006 and starred Kirsten Dunst as the French queen. Somewhere, a Hollywood story directed by Coppola and starring Stephen Dorff as a ennui-ridden movie star and Elle Fanning as his daughter, was released in 2010. Her 2013 film The Bling Ring starred Katie Chang and Emma Watson as ennui-ridden LA teens who break into celebrity homes for the thrill of it.Extra credit: Sofia Coppola married filmmaker Spike Jonze (director of Being John Malkovich) in 1999; they were divorced in 2003. She married Thomas Mars, front man of the French rock group Phoenix, in 2011. They have two daughters together: Romy (born 2006) and Cosima (born 2010).Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC.
