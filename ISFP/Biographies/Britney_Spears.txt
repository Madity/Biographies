Britney Jean Spears (born December 2, 1981) is an American recording artist and entertainer. Born in McComb, Mississippi, and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, she performed acting roles in stage productions and television shows as a child before signing with Jive Records in 1997. Spears's first and second studio albums, ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), became international successes, with the former becoming the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist.[1] Title tracks "...Baby One More Time" and "Oops!... I Did It Again" broke international sales records. In 2001, Spears released her self-titled third studio album, Britney, and played the starring role in the film Crossroads (2002). She assumed creative control of her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003), which yielded the worldwide success of the "Toxic" single.
In 2007, Spears's much-publicized personal struggles sent her career into hiatus. Her fifth studio album, Blackout, was released later that year, and spawned hits such as "Gimme More" and "Piece of Me". Her erratic behavior and hospitalizations continued through the following year, at which point she was placed under a still on-going conservatorship. Spears's sixth studio album, Circus (2008), included global chart-topping lead single "Womanizer". Its supporting tour The Circus Starring Britney Spears was one of the highest-grossing global concert tours in 2009.[2] Later that October, "3" became Spears's third single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Her seventh studio album, Femme Fatale (2011), became her first to yield three top-ten singles in the United States: "Hold It Against Me", "Till the World Ends" and "I Wanna Go". She also served as a judge during the second season of the American version of The X Factor. Spears's eponymous eighth studio album Britney Jean was released in 2013; it spawned the top 15 hit "Work Bitch", however it became the lowest-selling record of her career. Later that year, Spears began the two-year residency show Britney: Piece of Me at The AXIS at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas.
Spears was established as a pop icon and credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s. She became the 'best-selling teenaged artist of all time'[3] and garnered honorific titles including the "Princess of Pop".[4] Her work has earned her numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award, six MTV Video Music Awards including the Lifetime Achievement Award, nine Billboard Music Awards, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2009, Billboard ranked her as the 8th overall Artist of the Decade,[5] and also recognized her as the best-selling female artist of the first decade of the 21st century, as well as the fifth overall.[6] The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) named Spears as the eighth top-selling female artist in the United States, with 34 million certified albums.[7] Nielsen SoundScan ranked her the tenth best-selling digital artist of the country, with more than 28.6 million digital singles as of January 2012.[8] She has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[9] Rolling Stone recognized her instant success as one of the Top 25 Teen Idol Breakout Moments of all time,[10] while VH1 ranked her eleventh on their "100 Greatest Women in Music" list in 2012,[11] and Billboard named her the sexiest woman in music.[12] Forbes reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of 2012, with earnings of $58 million, having last topped the list in 2002.[13]
Britney Jean Spears was born on December 2, 1981.[14] She is the second child of Lynne Irene (Bridges) and James Parnell Spears. Her maternal grandmother, Lillian Portell, was English (born in London), and one of Spears's maternal great-great-grandfathers was Maltese.[15][16][17] Her siblings are Bryan James and Jamie Lynn.[18] At age three, she started attending dance lessons in her hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana, and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. During her childhood, she also attended gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.[19][20][21] Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing "What Child Is This?" at her kindergarten graduation. She said about her ambition as a child, "I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age".[20] At age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to Atlanta for an audition in the 1990s revival of The Mickey Mouse Club. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her for being too young to join the series at the time, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's vocals and suggested enrolling her at the Professional Performing Arts School; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York. Spears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical Ruthless!. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show Star Search and was cast in a number of commercials.[22][23] In December 1992, she was finally cast in The Mickey Mouse Club, but returned to Kentwood after the show was canceled. She enrolled at Parklane Academy in nearby McComb, Mississippi. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to "the opening scene in Clueless with all the cliques. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more."[20][24]
In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join the female pop group Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided he wanted to pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song of Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a sound engineer. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, arguing that audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and "there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson, or another Tiffany." Two weeks later, executives from Jive Records returned calls to Rudolph.[25] Senior vice president of A&R Jeff Fenster stated about Spears's audition that "It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'—is extremely important. And Britney had that."[20] She then sang Houston's "I Have Nothing" (1992) for the executives, and got signed to the label.[26] They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from "lower and less poppy" delivery to "distinctively, unmistakably Britney."[27] After hearing the recorded material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned "Sheryl Crow music, but younger more adult contemporary" but felt all right with her label's appointment of producers, since "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me." She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others.[20]
After Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her upcoming album. Her show was a four song set and she was accompanied by two back up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for 'N Sync.[28] Her debut studio album, ...Baby One More Time, was released on January 12, 1999.[29] It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and was certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America after a month. Worldwide, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and sold over 10 million copies in a year.[30] It became the biggest selling album ever by a teenage artist.[21] The title track was released as the lead single from the album. Originally, Jive Records wanted its music video to be animated; however, Spears rejected it, and suggested the final idea of a Catholic schoolgirl.[27] The single sold 500,000 copies on its first day, and peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, topping the chart for two consecutive weeks. It has sold more than 10 million as of today, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time.[31][32] "...Baby One More Time" later received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[33] The title track also topped the singles chart for two weeks in the United Kingdom, and became the fastest-selling single ever by a female artist, shipping over 460,000 copies.[34] It would later become the 25th most successful song of all time in British chart history.[35] Spears is also the youngest female artist to have a million seller in the country.[36] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" was released as the third single from the album. It became a top-ten hit worldwide and propelled ...Baby One More Time to sell even more. As of today, ...Baby One More Time has sold 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It is also the best-selling first album by any artist ever.[37]
The April 1999 cover of Rolling Stone featured Spears lying on her bed, covered with a bra, shorts and an open top. The American Family Association (AFA) referred to the shoot as "a disturbing mix of childhood innocence and adult sexuality" and called to "God-loving Americans to boycott stores selling Britney's albums." Spears responded to the outcry commenting, "What's the big deal? I have strong morals. [...] I'd do it again. I thought the pictures were fine. And I was tired of being compared to Debbie Gibson and all of this bubblegum pop all the time."[38] Shortly before, Spears had announced publicly she would remain a virgin until marriage.[21] On June 28, 1999, Spears began her first headlining ...Baby One More Time Tour in North America, which was positively received by critics,[39] but generated some controversy due to her racy outfits.[40] An extension of the tour, titled Crazy 2k, followed in March 2000. Spears premiered songs from her upcoming second album during the show.[24]
Oops!... I Did It Again, her second studio album, was released in May 2000. It debuted at number one in the US, selling 1.3 million copies, breaking the SoundScan record for the highest debut sales by any solo artist.[41] The album sold over 25 million copies worldwide to date, making one of the best-selling albums of all time.[42] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said that "the great thing about Oops! – under the cheese surface, Britney's demand for satisfaction is complex, fierce and downright scary, making her a true child of rock & roll tradition."[43] The album's lead single, "Oops!... I Did It Again", peaked at the top of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and many other European nations.[36][44] The album as well as the title track received Grammy nominations for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, respectively.[45]
The same year, Spears embarked on the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour, which grossed $40.5 million; she also released her first book, Britney Spears' Heart-to-Heart, co-written with her mother.[21] On September 7, 2000, Spears performed at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. Halfway through the performance, she ripped off her black suit to reveal a sequined flesh-colored bodysuit, followed by heavy dance routine. It is noted by critics as the moment that Spears showed signs of becoming a more provocative performer.[46] Amidst media speculation, Spears confirmed she was dating 'N Sync member Justin Timberlake.[21]
In February 2001, Spears signed a $7–8 million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, entitled A Mother’s Gift.[21] Her self-titled third studio album, Britney, was released in November 2001. While on tour, she felt inspired by hip hop artists such as Jay-Z and The Neptunes and wanted to create a record with a funkier sound.[47] The album debuted at number one in the Billboard 200 and reached top five positions in Australia, the United Kingdom and mainland Europe and sold over 12 million copies worldwide.[36][48][49] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called Britney "the record where she strives to deepen her persona, making it more adult while still recognizably Britney. [...] It does sound like the work of a star who has now found and refined her voice, resulting in her best record yet."[50] The album was honored with two Grammy nominations—Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for "Overprotected"— and was listed in 2008 as one of Entertainment Weekly's "100 Best Albums from the Past 25 Years".[51][52] The album's first single, "I'm a Slave 4 U", became a top-ten hit worldwide.[53]
Spears's performance of the single at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards featured a caged tiger and a large albino python draped over her shoulders. It was harshly received by animal rights organization PETA, who claimed the animals were mistreated and scrapped plans for an anti-fur billboard that was to feature Spears.[46] To support the album, Spears embarked on the Dream Within a Dream Tour. The show was critically praised for its technical innovations, the pièce de résistance being a water screen that pumped two tons of water into the stage.[54][55] The tour grossed $43.7 million, becoming the second highest grossing tour of 2002 by a female artist, behind Cher's Farewell Tour.[56] Her career success was highlighted by Forbes in 2002, as Spears was ranked the world's most powerful celebrity.[57] Spears also landed her first starring role in Crossroads, released in February 2002. Although the film was largely panned, some critics praised Spears's acting.[58][59][60] Crossroads, which had a $11 million budget, went on to gross over $57 million worldwide.[60]
In June 2002, Spears opened her first restaurant, Nyla, in New York City, but terminated her relationship in November, citing mismanagement and "management's failure to keep her fully apprised".[61] In July 2002, Spears announced she would take a six-month break from her career; however, she went back into the studio in November to record her new album.[62] Spears's relationship with Justin Timberlake ended after three years. In December 2002, Timberlake released the song "Cry Me a River" as the second single from his solo debut album. The music video featured a Spears look-alike and fueled the rumors that she had been unfaithful to him.[63][64] As a response, Spears wrote the ballad "Everytime" with her backing vocalist and friend Annet Artani.[65] The same year, Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst said that he was in a relationship with Spears. However, Spears denied Durst's claims. In a 2009 interview, he explained that "I just guess at the time it was taboo for a guy like me to be associated with a gal like her."[66] Spears opened the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards with Christina Aguilera, performing "Like a Virgin". Halfway through they were joined by Madonna, with whom they both kissed. The incident was highly publicized.[60]
Spears released her fourth studio album, In the Zone, in November 2003. She assumed more creative control by writing and co-producing most of the material.[21] Vibe called it "A supremely confident dance record that also illustrates Spears's development as a songwriter."[67] NPR listed the album as one of "The 50 Most Important Recording of the Decade", adding that "the decade's history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work."[68] In the Zone sold over 609,000 copies in the United States and debuted at the top of the charts, making Spears the first female artist in the SoundScan era to have her first four studio albums to debut at number one.[21] It also debuted at the top of the charts in France and the top ten in Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands.[69] In the Zone sold over 10 million copies worldwide.[70] The album produced the hit singles: "Me Against the Music", a collaboration with Madonna; "Toxic"—which won Spears her only Grammy for Best Dance Recording; "Everytime" and "Outrageous".[21]
In January 2004, Spears married childhood friend Jason Allen Alexander at The Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas. The marriage was annulled 55 hours later, stating that Spears "lacked understanding of her actions".[71] In March 2004, she embarked on The Onyx Hotel Tour in support of In the Zone.[72] In June 2004, Spears fell and injured her left knee during the music video shoot for "Outrageous". Spears underwent arthroscopic surgery. She was forced to remain six weeks with a thigh brace, followed by eight to twelve weeks of rehabilitation, which caused The Onyx Hotel Tour to be canceled.[73] During 2004, Spears became involved in the Kabbalah Centre through her friendship with Madonna.[74]
In July 2004, Spears became engaged to American dancer Kevin Federline, whom she had met three months before. The romance received intense attention from the media, since Federline had recently broken up with actress Shar Jackson, who was still pregnant with their second child at the time.[21] The stages of their relationship were chronicled in Spears's first reality show Britney & Kevin: Chaotic. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement.[75] Shortly after, she released her first fragrance with Elizabeth Arden, Curious, which broke the company's first-week gross for a perfume.[21] In October 2004, Spears took a career break to start a family.[76] Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, her first greatest hits compilation album, was released in November 2004.[77] Spears's cover version of Bobby Brown's "My Prerogative" was released as the lead single from the album, reaching the top of the charts in Finland, Ireland, Italy and Norway.[78] The second single, "Do Somethin'", was a top ten hit in Australia, the United Kingdom and other countries of mainland Europe.[79][80] The greatest hits album sold over 5 million copies worldwide.[81] In September 2005, Spears gave birth to her first child, Sean Preston Federline.[82]
In November 2005, she released her first remix compilation, B in the Mix: The Remixes, which consists of eleven remixes.[83] It has sold over 1 million copies worldwide.[84] In February 2006, pictures surfaced of Spears driving with her son Sean, on her lap instead of in a car seat. Child advocates were horrified by the photos of her holding the wheel with one hand and Sean with the other. Spears claimed that the situation happened because of a frightening encounter with paparazzi, and that it was a mistake on her part.[21] The following month, she guest-starred on the Will & Grace episode "Buy, Buy Baby" as closeted lesbian Amber Louise.[85] She announced she no longer studied Kabbalah in June 2006, explaining, "my baby is my religion."[74] Two months later, Spears posed nude for the cover of Harper's Bazaar. The picture was heavily compared to Demi Moore's August 1991 Vanity Fair cover.[21] In September 2006, she gave birth to her second child, Jayden James Federline.[86] In November 2006, Spears filed for divorce from Federline, citing irreconcilable differences.[87] Their divorce was finalized in July 2007, when the couple reached a global settlement and agreed to share joint custody of their children.[88]
Spears's aunt Sandra Bridges Covington, with whom she had been very close, died of ovarian cancer in January.[89] In February 2007, Spears stayed in a drug rehabilitation facility in Antigua for less than a day. The following night, she shaved her head with electric clippers at a hair salon in Tarzana, Los Angeles. She admitted herself to other treatment facilities during the following weeks.[90] In May 2007, she produced a series of promotional concerts at House of Blues venues, titled The M+M's Tour.[91] In October 2007, Spears lost physical custody of her children to Federline. The reasons of the court ruling were not revealed to the public.[92] Spears was also sued by Louis Vuitton over her 2005 music video "Do Somethin'" for upholstering her Hummer interior in counterfeit Louis Vuitton cherry blossom fabric, which resulted in the video being banned on European TV stations.[93]
In October 2007, Spears released her fifth studio album, Blackout. The album debuted at the top of charts in Canada and Ireland, number two in the U.S. Billboard 200, France, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom and the top ten in Australia, Korea, New Zealand and many European nations. In the United States, Spears became the only female artist to have her first five studio albums debut at the two top slots of the chart.[94] The album received positive reviews from critics and has sold over 3 million copies worldwide.[95][96] Blackout won Album of the Year at MTV Europe Music Awards 2008 and was listed as the fifth Best Pop Album of the Decade by The Times.[97][98] Spears performed the lead single "Gimme More" at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards. The performance was panned by many critics.[99] Despite the backlash, the single rocketed to worldwide success, peaking at number one in Canada and the top ten in almost every country it charted.[100][101] The second single "Piece of Me" reached the top of the charts in Ireland and reached the top five in Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The third single "Break the Ice" was released the following year and had moderate success due to Spears not being able to promote it properly.[102][103][104] In December 2007, Spears began a relationship with paparazzo Adnan Ghalib.[105]
In January 2008, Spears refused to relinquish custody of her sons to Federline's representatives. She was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after police that arrived at her house noted she appeared to be under the influence of an illicit substance. The following day, Spears's visitation rights were suspended at an emergency court hearing, and Federline was given sole physical and legal custody of the children. She was committed to the psychiatric ward of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and put on 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold. The court placed her under temporary conservatorship of her father James Spears and attorney Andrew Wallet, giving them complete control of her assets.[21] She was released five days later.[106] The following month, she guest-starred on the How I Met Your Mother episode "Ten Sessions" as receptionist Abby. She received positive reviews for her performance, as well as bringing the series its highest ratings ever.[107][108] In July 2008, Spears regained some visitation rights after coming to an agreement with Federline and his counsel.[109] In September 2008, Spears opened the MTV Video Music Awards with a pre-taped comedy sketch with Jonah Hill and an introduction speech. She won Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Video of the Year for "Piece of Me".[110] A 60-minute introspective documentary, Britney: For the Record, was produced to chronicle Spears's return to the recording industry. Directed by Phil Griffin, For the Record was entirely shot in Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York City during the third quarter of 2008.[111] The documentary was broadcast on MTV to 5.6 million viewers for the two airings on the premiere night. It was the highest rating in its Sunday night timeslot and in the network's history.[112]
In December 2008, Spears's sixth studio album Circus was released. It received positive reviews from critics[113] and debuted at number one in Canada, Czech Republic and the United States, and inside the top ten in many European nations.[101][114] In the United States, Spears became the youngest female artist to have five albums debut at number one, earning a place in Guinness World Records.[115] She also became the only act in the Soundscan era to have four albums debut with 500,000 or more copies sold.[114] The album was one of the fastest-selling albums of the year,[116] and has sold 4 million copies worldwide.[117] Its lead single, "Womanizer", became Spears's first number one in the Billboard Hot 100 since "...Baby One More Time". The single also topped the charts in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway and Sweden.[118][119] It was also nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Dance Recording.[120] In January 2009, Spears and her father James obtained a restraining order against her former manager Sam Lutfi, ex-boyfriend Adnan Ghalib and attorney Jon Eardley—all of whom, court documents claim, had been conspiring to gain control of Spears's affairs. The restraining order forbids Lutfi and Ghalib from contacting Spears or coming within 250 yards of her, her property or family members.[121] Spears embarked on The Circus Starring Britney Spears in March 2009. With a gross of U.S. $131.8 million, it became the fifth highest grossing tour of the year.[122]
In November 2009, Spears released her second greatest hits album, The Singles Collection. The album's lead and only single, "3" became her third number one single in the U.S.[123] In May 2010, Spears's representatives confirmed she was dating her agent Jason Trawick, and that they had decided to end their professional relationship to focus on their personal relationship.[124] Spears designed a limited edition clothing line for Candie's, which was released in stores in July 2010.[125] In September 2010, she made a cameo appearance on a Spears-themed tribute episode of American TV show Glee, titled "Britney/Brittany". The episode drew Glee's highest ratings ever.[126][127]
In March 2011, Spears released her seventh studio album Femme Fatale.[128] The album peaked at number one in the United States, Canada, and Australia, and peaked inside the top ten on nearly every other chart. Its peak in the United States ties Britney with Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson for the third-most number ones among women.[129] It has sold 1,000,000 copies in the United States and 2.2 million worldwide, and has been certified platinum by the RIAA.[130][131] The album's lead single "Hold It Against Me" debuted at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Spears's fourth number-one single on the chart and making her the second artist in history to have two consecutive singles debut at number-one, after Mariah Carey.[132] The second single "Till The World Ends" reached peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 in May,[133] while the third single "I Wanna Go" reached number seven in August. Femme Fatale became Spears's first album in which three of its songs reached the top ten of the chart.[134] The fourth and final single "Criminal" was released in September 2011. The music video caused controversy when British politicians criticized Spears for using replica guns while filming the video in an area of London that had been badly affected by the 2011 England riots.[135] Spears's management briefly responded, stating, "The video is a fantasy story featuring Britney's boyfriend, Jason Trawick, which literally plays out the lyrics of a song written three years before the riots ever happened."[136] In April 2011, Spears appeared in a remix of Rihanna's song "S&M".[137] It reached number one in the US later in the month, giving Spears her fifth number one on the chart.[138] On Billboard's 2011 Year-End list, Spears was ranked number fourteen on the Artists of the Year,[139] thirty-two on Billboard 200 artists and ten on Billboard Hot 100 artists.[140][141]
In June 2011, Spears embarked on the Femme Fatale Tour.[142] The first ten dates of the tour grossed $6.2 million, landing the fifty-fifth spot on Pollstar's Top 100 North American Tours list for the half-way point of the year.[143] The tour ended on December 10, 2011 in Puerto Rico after 79 performances.[144] A DVD of the tour was released in November 2011.[145] In August 2011, Spears received the MTV Video Vanguard Award at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards.[146] The next month, she released her second remix album, B in the Mix: The Remixes Vol. 2.[147] In December, Spears became engaged to her long-time boyfriend Jason Trawick, who had formerly been her agent.[148] Trawick became a co-conservator of Spears, alongside her father, in April 2012.[149] In January 2013, Spears and Trawick ended their engagement. Trawick was also removed as Spears's co-conservator, restoring her father as the sole conservator.[150][151]
In May 2012, Spears was hired to replace Nicole Scherzinger as a judge for the second season of the U.S. version of The X Factor, joining Simon Cowell, L.A. Reid and fellow new judge Demi Lovato, who replaced Paula Abdul. With a reported salary of $15 million, she became the highest-paid judge on a singing competition series in television history.[152] She mentored the Teens category; her final act, Carly Rose Sonenclar, was named the runner-up of the season. Spears did not return for the show's third season and her spot was filled by Kelly Rowland.[153][154] Spears was featured on will.i.am's "Scream & Shout", which was released as a single from his fourth studio album, #willpower (2013). The song later became Spears's sixth number one single on the UK Singles Chart and peaked at #3 on US Billboard Hot 100.[155] In December, Forbes magazine named her music's top-earning woman of 2012, with estimated earnings of $58 million.[156]
Spears began work on her eighth studio album in December 2012,[157] and enlisted will.i.am as its executive producer in May 2013.[158] On September 17, 2013, she appeared on Good Morning America to announce her two-year residency show at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, titled Britney: Piece of Me. It began on December 27, 2013, and will include a total of 100 shows throughout 2014 and 2015.[159][160] During the same appearance, Spears announced that her eighth studio album Britney Jean would be released on December 3, 2013, in the United States.[161][162] It was released through RCA Records due to the disbandment of Jive Records in 2011.[163] Furthermore, Britney Jean became Spears's final project under her original recording contract with RCA, which had guaranteed the release of eight studio albums.[164] The record received a low amount of promotion and commercial impact, reportedly due to contractual obligations for Britney: Piece of Me.[165] Upon its release, the record debuted at number four on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 107,000 copies, becoming her lowest-peaking and lowest-selling album in the United States.[166] Britney Jean debuted at number 34 on the UK Albums Chart, selling 12,959 copies in its first week. In doing so, it became Spears's lowest-charting and lowest-selling album in the country.[167]
"Work Bitch" was released as the lead single from Britney Jean on September 16, 2013, one day earlier than expected after being leaked online.[168] It debuted and peaked at number 12 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.[169] The second single "Perfume" was premiered on November 3, 2013, two days earlier than originally announced.[170][171] It debuted and peaked at number 76 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.[172] During the production of Britney Jean, Spears recorded the song "Ooh La La" for the soundtrack of The Smurfs 2 earlier in 2013.[173] In October 2013, she was featured as a guest vocalist on Miley Cyrus' track "SMS (Bangerz)", taken from her fourth studio album Bangerz (2013).[174] It debuted in the Billboard charts at number 10 in US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, number 29 in the US Pop Digital Singles, and number 70 in the US Hot Digital Songs, respectively. On January 8, 2014, Spears won Favorite Pop Artist at the 40th People's Choice Awards at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles.[175]
Following her debut, Spears was credited with leading the revival of teen pop in the late 1990s. The Daily Yomiuri reported that "[m]usic critics have hailed her as the most gifted teenage pop idol for many years, but Spears has set her sights a little higher-she is aiming for the level of superstardom that has been achieved by Madonna and Janet Jackson."[176] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote: "Britney Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just has to make a scene."[177] Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin, commented, "I know from Denniz Pop and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice."[178] Following the release of her debut album, Chuck Taylor of Billboard observed, "Spears has become a consummate performer, with snappy dance moves, a clearly real-albeit young-and funkdified voice ... "(You Drive Me) Crazy", her third single ... demonstrates Spears's own development, proving that the 17-year-old is finding her own vocal personality after so many months of steadfast practice."[179] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic referred to her music as a "blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry."[180] Spears later commented, "With ...Baby One More Time, I didn't get to show my voice off. The songs were great, but they weren't very challenging".[181]
Oops!...I Did It Again and subsequent albums saw Spears working with several contemporary R&B producers, leading to "a combination of bubblegum, urban soul, and raga."[182] Her third studio album, Britney derived from the teen pop niche, "[r]hythmically and melodically ... sharper, tougher than what came before. What used to be unabashedly frothy has some disco grit, underpinned by Spears' spunky self-determination that helps sell hooks that are already catchier, by and large, than those that populated her previous two albums."[183] Guy Blackman of The Age wrote that while few would care to listen to an entire Spears album, "[t]he thing about Spears, though, is that her biggest songs, no matter how committee-created or impossibly polished, have always been convincing because of her delivery, her commitment and her presence. For her mostly teenage fans, Spears expresses perfectly the conflicting urges of adolescence, the tension between chastity and sexual experience, between hedonism and responsibility, between confidence and vulnerability."[184] Since her self-titled album, Britney,[185] Spears has explored and heavily incorporated the electropop genre in her albums, including songs from the albums Blackout and Femme Fatale.[186][187][188][189][190][191]
The cover of The Jets song was the first song recorded by Spears for her then-label Jive in 1997.[192] The prominent use of melisma and vibratos as she continuously raises key into a high range was viewed as a Mariah Carey influence.[193]
The track is built around the 'wobbler' effect of dubstep, and her vocals are pitched down low, making her sound masculine.[194][195] She was credited as one of the artists who prompted the genre within a pop mainstream audience.[196]
Spears possesses a soprano vocal range;[197] her vocal ability however has been criticized.[198] Critic Allan Raible derides her overdependence in Circus on digital effects and the robotic effect it creates. "She’s never been a strong vocalist..." writes Raible, "Could she handle these songs with stripped down arrangements and no vocal effects? More importantly, would anyone want to hear her attempt such a performance? Does it matter? No. The focus is still image over substance."[199] Her image and persona are also often contrasted to Christina Aguilera. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly observed "Christina Aguilera may flash skin and belly button, but in her music and manner, she's too eager not to offend — she's a good girl pretending to be bad. Spears, however, comes across as a bad girl acting good ... Spears' artificial-sweetener voice is much less interesting than the settings, yet that blandness is actually a relief compared with Aguilera's numbing vocal gymnastics."[200] In contrast, Allmusic comments: "Like her peer Christina Aguilera, Britney equates maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs ... Where Christina comes across like a natural-born skank, Britney is the girl next door cutting loose at college, drinking and smoking and dancing and sexing just a little too recklessly, since this is the first time she can indulge herself."[201] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine notes, "The disparity between Aguilera and Spears can't be measured solely by the timbre and octave range of their voices ... [Aguilera's] popularity has never reached the fever pitch of Britney's."[202]
It has been widely reported that Spears lip syncs in concert. Author Gary Giddins wrote in his book Natural selection: Gary Giddins on comedy, film, music, and books (2006) that "among many other performers accused of moving their lips while a machine does the labor are Britney Spears, Luciano Pavarotti, Shania Twain, Beyoncé, and Madonna."[203] Rashod D. Ollison of The Baltimore Sun observes: "Many pop stars ... feel they have no choice but to seek vocal enhancement. Since the advent of MTV and other video music channels, pop audiences have been fed elaborate videos thick with jaw-dropping effects, awesome choreography, fabulous clothes, marvelous bodies. And the same level of perfection is expected to extend beyond the video set to the concert stage. So if Britney Spears, Janet Jackson or Madonna sounds shrill and flat without a backing track, fans won't pay up to $300 for a concert ticket."[204] Giddins adds, "it was reported Britney Spears fans prefer her to lip-sync—despite her denials of doing so (contradicted by her own director)—because they expect flawless digitalization when they pay serious money for a concert."[203]
In Australia, NSW Fair Trading Minister Virginia Judge has advised disclaimers be printed on any ticket for concerts which contain any prerecorded vocals. She commented: "There could have been some instances where people actually go and purchase a ticket thinking that they're going to have a live performance ... for some people that means that everything is live, it's fresh, it happens instantaneously, it's not something that's been pre-recorded. You want to make sure that they're actually paying for what they think they're getting."[205] Noting on the prevalence of lip-syncing, Los Angeles Daily News reported "in the context of a Britney Spears concert, does it really matter? Like a Vegas revue show, you don't go to hear the music, you go for the somewhat-ridiculous spectacle of it all".[206] Similarly, Aline Mendelsohn of the Orlando Sentinel remarked: "Let's get one thing straight: A Britney Spears concert is not about the music ... you have to remember that it's about the sight, not the sound."[207] Critic Glenn Gamboa comments her concert tours are "like her life—a massive money-making venture designed to play up her talents and distract from her shortcomings with a mix of techno-tinged sex appeal and disco-flavored flash. And, like her life, it is, more or less, a success."[208]
Throughout her career, Spears has drawn frequent comparisons to Madonna and Janet Jackson, in terms of vocals, choreography and stage presence, citing both as influences in her work. She has also named Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Sheryl Crow, Otis Redding, Shania Twain, Bruno Mars, Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé and Lorde as sources of inspiration.[209][210][211][212] According to Spears: "I know when I was younger, I looked up to people... like, you know, Janet Jackson and Madonna. And they were major inspirations for me. But I also had my own identity and I knew who I was, you know."[213] In the 2002 book Madonnastyle by Carol Clerk, she is quoted saying: "I have been a huge fan of Madonna since I was a little girl. She's the person that I've really looked up to. I would really, really like to be a legend like Madonna."[214]
Many critics have argued that Spears should not be considered in the same league of talent as Jackson or Madonna. Journalists Erika Montalvo and Jackie Sheppard of the Rocky Mountain Collegian observed "[s]ome may argue that Spears is not only a good recording artist but also an important cultural icon."[215] However, in examining her level of skill as an artist, it is questioned that "[a]lthough she has been classified among female elites such as Janet Jackson and Madonna, what does Ms. Spears really have in common with these divas of rock?"[215] Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe remarked that "[t]hirteen costume changes in 90 minutes won't bless her with Madonna's intelligence or cultural barometer. An army of cutting-edge R&B producers won't supply her with Janet Jackson's sense of humor or sincere smile ... Britney's heroes aren't great singers. But they're real singers. Spears sounds robotic, nearly inhuman, on her records, so processed is her voice by digital pitch-shifters and synthesizers."[216]
Reporter Ed Bumgardner commented her transition from teen pop start to adult sex symbol with her third studio album Britney "takes its cues from two other successful performers—Madonna and Janet Jackson—both of whom she brazenly rips off and both of whom, like Spears, are passable singers, at best."[217] Critic Shane Harrison wrote: "From the minimalist thump and "Nasty" feel of "I'm a Slave 4 U" to the scattered quotes in "Boys", [Britney] feels like [Spears's] attempt at 'Control'."[209]
Citing Jackson's resolve to incorporate personal and social issues into her work and Madonna's ability to constantly redefine the boundaries of socially acceptable material in the industry, Spears's catalog ultimately pales in comparison, because "[w]hile Jackson and Madonna wrote their own music about subjects of importance, [Spears's] music sounds like an upbeat version of either, 'I want to grow up but the media won't let me,' or 'Here kitty, kitty, I'm wearing my underwear outside of my leather pants'-type ballads."[215] In contrast, Guy Blackman argues that although "no one would argue that Spears is some kind of pioneering pop auteur, there’s still a lot to like about her back catalogue. During her world-conquering peak, she was just about as cutting edge as you could get in the world of global pop superstardom. Spears didn’t just work with big names, she gave big names their names, and maintained her high currency in the world’s most fickle industry for years, when most aspiring starlets are lucky to manage months."[184]
After meeting Spears face to face, Janet Jackson stated: "she said to me, 'I'm such a big fan; I really admire you.' That's so flattering. Everyone gets inspiration from some place. And it's awesome to see someone else coming up who's dancing and singing, and seeing how all these kids relate to her. A lot of people put it down, but what she does is a positive thing."[218] Madonna's respect for Spears has also been a subject of observation. Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors of Madonna's drowned worlds: new approaches to her cultural transformations, 1983–2003 (2004) note that the most well known cross-generational relationship exists between Spears and Madonna in which "the entertainment newsmedia almost became obsessed with their relationship of mutual admiration."[219] The biographers also report "[s]ome observers of popular culture, however, feel that the comparisons between the two artist are meaningless and fail to recognize Madonna's unique contribution: Madonna was never 'just another pop star' whereas Britney can more easily be seen as a standard manufactured pop act."[219]
Spears became an international pop culture icon immediately after launching her recording career. Rolling Stone magazine wrote: "One of the most controversial and successful female vocalists of the 21st century," she "spearheaded the rise of post-millennial teen pop ... Spears early on cultivated a mixture of innocence and experience that broke the bank".[220] She is listed by the Guinness World Records as having the "Best-selling album by a teenage solo artist" for her debut album ...Baby One More Time which sold over thirteen million copies in the United States.[221] Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported, "She's also marked for being the best-selling teenage artist. Before she turned 20 in 2001, Spears sold more than 37 million albums worldwide".[222] As of 2011, she has sold over 100 million albums worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time based on album sales alone.[223] She was also ranked as the fourth VH1's "50 Greatest Women of the Video Era" show list, ahead of most of her contemporaries and only behind veterans Madonna, Janet Jackson, and Whitney Houston.[224] Spears is also recognized as the best-selling female artist of the first decade of the 21st century, as well as the fifth overall.[6] In December 2009, Billboard magazine ranked Spears the 8th Artist of the 2000s decade in the United States.[5]
Spears is also known for her iconic performances and music videos.[225] The music video for her debut single, "...Baby One More Time", was ranked number one on TRL's Final Countdown of the most iconic music videos.[226] At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, before performing "Oops!... I Did It Again", the singer appeared behind a backlit screen, and descended a spiral staircase and started performing "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", while wearing a tuxedo.[227] After performing a shortened version of the track, she tore the tuxedo off, revealing a skin-tight flesh-coloured outfit.[228] The following year, Spears performed her single "I'm a Slave 4 U". Jocelyn Vena of MTV summarized the performance, saying, "draping herself in a white python and slithering around a steamy garden setting – surrounded by dancers in zebra and tiger outfits – Spears created one of the most striking visuals in the 27-year history of the show."[229] She also duetted "The Way You Make Me Feel" with pop singer Michael Jackson at his 30th anniversary concert a few days earlier.[230] During the opening of the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards on August 28, 2003, Spears joined Madonna, Christina Aguilera, and Missy Elliott.[231] Halfway through the performance, Madonna kissed Spears and Aguilera on the lips.[232] The kiss between Spears and Madonna generated strong reaction from the media.[233] This performance was listed by Blender magazine as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history.[234] MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moments in the history of MTV Video Music Awards.[235]
Barbara Ellen of The Observer has reported: "Spears is famously one of the 'oldest' teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena — a child with a full-time career. While other little girls were putting posters on their walls, Britney was wanting to be the poster on the wall. Whereas other children develop at their own pace, Britney was developing at a pace set by the ferociously competitive American entertainment industry".[236] In 2011, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly commented on the cultural significance of Spears's voice and music. "We don't ask a whole lot from Britney Spears as an entertainer...we'll still send her straight up the charts simply because she's Britney. She's an American institution, as deeply sacred and messed up as pro wrestling or the filibuster. Musically, though, Spears will always have to measure up to her own gold standards of pop euphony: the operatic slither of 2004's 'Toxic' and the candied funk of 2000's 'Oops!...I Did It Again.' Spears is no technical singer, that's for sure. But backed by Martin and Dr. Luke's wall of pound, her vocals melt into a mix of babytalk coo and coital panting that is, in its own overprocessed way, just as iconic and propulsive as Michael Jackson's yips or Eminem's snarls."[237] 'Britney Spears' was Yahoo!'s most popular search term between 2005 and 2008, and has been in a total of seven different years.[238] Spears was named as Most Searched Person in the Guinness World Records book edition 2007 and 2009.[239] She was later named as the most searched person of the decade 2000 – 2009.[240] Spears is the most followed person on Google's social network, Google+. Reaching 100,000 in under two months of the sites launch, quadrupling the amount within 10 days. By November she had over 760,000 followers,[241] and by the end of December 2011, Spears became the first person to reach over 1 million followers.[242]
Spears has been cited as a musical inspiration by contemporary artists. Gwyneth Paltrow's character on 2010 drama film Country Strong was inspired on the singer's public meltdown. According to film director Shana Fest, "that's where this movie came from. I mean, I was seeing what was happening in the media to Britney Spears. I think it's tragic how we treat people who give us so much, and we love to see them knocked down to build them back up again, to knock them down again."[243] Nicki Minaj has cited Spears as a major influence on her career, and commented, "the fact that she came back out with just so much fire inspires me, and it inspires young women and people all over the world. It just inspires you. A lot of my fans feel like they are the underdog and feel like they are the people who aren’t ever accepted for themselves, or who are laughed at or poked fun at forever. It just goes to show that once you keep at whatever it is you’re doing, people may not like you, people may not love you, but they will have to respect you at the end of the day. And that respect is all that matters."[244] Lana Del Rey revealed that she is compelled by Spears in an interview with MTV, saying, "I'm not really interested in a ton of female musicians but there is something about Britney that compelled me – the way she sings and just the way she looks."[245] Del Rey also said that the "Toxic" music video is a main inspiration of her work.[246] During the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Lady Gaga said that Spears "taught us all how to be fearless, and the industry wouldn't be the same without her."[247] Miley Cyrus credits Spears as her biggest inspiration, and has referenced the singer in her hit song "Party in the U.S.A." (2009).[248][249] Spears's personal breakdown was also cited as an inspiration for Barry Manilow's album "15 Minutes".[250]
Spears has also become a major influence among many new artists, including fellow The X Factor judge Demi Lovato,[251] Katy Perry,[251] Kristinia DeBarge,[252] Little Boots,[253] Marina and the Diamonds,[254] Pixie Lott,[255] Girls' Generation, and The Saturdays.[256] Fergie of The Black Eyed Peas revealed to The Hollywood Reporter that she was happy with Spears's return to the music industry, and continued, "It's amazing. For this many years being in the business, and everything she's been through, it's wonderful to see her make this huge of a comeback. Really, it's a beautiful thing."[257] Simon Cowell explained that he is "fascinated by [Britney]. The fact that she’s one of the most talked about – not just pop stars – but people in the world today, means that you’ve got this star power. [...] She’s still hot, she’s still having hit records and she’s still controversial, there’s a reason for that."[258] Jessica Jung and Hyoyeon of the Korean girl group Girls' Generation have also been compared to Spears, due to their blonde hair and the latter's abilities as a dancer.[259] Marina and the Diamonds named Spears as the main influence for her Electra Heart album, stating that, "I think people thought I was joking about that for a long time. But when I was a teenager there was a genuine connection with this sweet girl who also had this very sexual side that people didn't really want to accept [...] Britney is really smart. And in the way that she inspired Electra Heart, if you step back from all the cynical stuff, it actually focuses on the idea of innocence being mixed with darkness. For some reason I really like that combination. I suppose because you don't really connect innocence with darkness."[260] Diamandis has also stated that Spears is her main influence when it comes to popular culture and that Spears is one she aspired to being growing up.[261]
Spears has had a direct influence on singer Porcelain Black's work after growing up around her music as a child. Black describes her music as a "love child between" Marilyn Manson and Spears, with Spears's work being one of the main inspirations for Black's debut album. She also stated that Spears inspired her deep love for choreography.[262] Bebo Norman wrote a song about Spears, called "Britney", which was released as a single. Boy band Busted also wrote a song about Spears called "Britney", which was on their debut album. South Korean singer, BoA has also spoken of love and Spears's influence on her. First meeting in 2003 while Spears was promoting "In The Zone" – Britney would later provide a writing credit to the song, Look Who's Talking, on BoA's eponymous debut English album. Spears's version of the song leaked in 2012.[263][264] Richard Cheese called Britney Spears "a remarkable recording artist" and also went on to say that she was "versatile" and what the industry calls an "artist". People magazine and MTV reported that October 1, 2008, the Bronx's John Philip Sousa Middle School, named their music studio in honor of Britney Spears.[265] Spears herself was present during the ceremony and donated $10,000 to the school's music program.[266] In August 2011, Spears was honored with the MTV Video Vanguard Award by Lady Gaga, for having made a profound effect on the MTV culture, with Gaga stating that "the industry wouldn't be the same without her."[247][267] In May 2013, new artist Ashley Allen said that although she had been greatly influenced by Celine Dion and Barbra Streisand, Britney Spears is her biggest inspiration.[268] She mentioned that she is obsessed with Britney and that when she attended Britney's concert, she cried. Adele has also stated multiple times that she is a big fan of Britney. In fact, Adele once cancelled her show by calling in sick just to go to a Britney concert that was on the same day.[269]
In 2000, the singer released a limited edition of glasses titled Shades of Britney.[270] In 2001, Spears signed a deal with shoe company Skechers,[271] and a $7–8 million promotional deal with Pepsi, their biggest entertainment deal at the time.[272] Aside from numerous commercials with the latter during that year, she also appeared in a 2004 Pepsi television commercial in the theme of "Gladiators" with singers Beyoncé, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias.[273] On June 19, 2002, she released her first multi-platform video game, Britney's Dance Beat, which received positive reviews.[274] In March 2009, Spears was announced as the new face of clothing brand Candie's.[275] Dari Marder, chief marketing officer for the brand, explained why they choose the singer, saying, "everybody loves a comeback and nobody's doing it better than Britney. She's just poised for even greater success."[275] In 2010, Spears designed a limited edition line for the brand, which was released in stores in July 2010.[125] In 2011, she teamed up with Sony, Make Up For Ever and PlentyofFish to release her music video for "Hold It Against Me", earning her $500,000 for the product placement.[276] Spears also teamed up with Hasbro in 2012 to release an exclusive version of Twister Dance, which includes a remix of "Till the World Ends". The singer was also featured on a commercial, which was directed by Ray Kay, to promote the game.[277]
Spears range of commercial deals and products also includes beauty care products and perfumes. She released her first fragrance with Elizabeth Arden, Curious in 2004, which broke the company's first-week gross for a perfume.[21] By 2009, she had released seven more fragrances, which earned her the recognition of the best-selling celebrity fragrance line on the market. The singer's Elizabeth Arden scents make up 34% of celebrity fragrance sales.[278] In 2010, Spears released her eighth fragrance, Radiance. In March 2011, company Brand Sense filed a lawsuit against Spears and Elizabeth Arden seeking $10 million in damages, claiming that the singer and her father, Jamie, allegedly stopped paying their thirty-five percent commission that was agreed as part of the contract terms.[279] In July 2011, a Los Angeles judge denied the request by the company lawyers, claiming the fact that Spears is still under conservatorship.[280] Brand Sense, however, stated that they would appeal the decision.[280] In 2011, Radiance was re-issued in a new fragrance titled Cosmic Radiance.[281] Worldwide, Spears sold over one million bottles in the first five years, with gross receipts of $1.5 billion.[282]
The singer founded The Britney Spears Foundation, a charitable entity set up to help children in need. The philosophy behind the Foundation was that music and entertainment has a healing quality that can benefit children.[283] The Foundation also supported the annual Britney Spears Camp for the Performing Arts, where campers had the opportunity to explore and develop their talents.[284] In April 2002, through the efforts of Spears and The Britney Spears Foundation, a grant of $1 million was made to the Twin Towers Fund to support the children of uniformed service heroes affected by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, including New York City Fire Department and its Emergency Medical Services Command, the New York City Police Department, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the New York State Office of court Administration and other government offices.[285] However, it was reported in 2008 that the Foundation had a deficit of $200,000.[286] After the singer went through conservatorship, her father and lawyer Andrew Wallet zeroed out the effort, leading to its closure in 2011.[287]
On October 30, 2001, Spears, alongside Bono and other popular recording artists under the name "Artists Against AIDS Worldwide", released a single titled "What's Going On", with the intention to benefit AIDS programs in Africa and other impoverished regions.[288] In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2006, Spears donated $350,000 to Music Rising.[289] Later in 2011, the singer raised $200,000 during An Evening of Southern Style at a private residence in Beverly Hills to benefit the St. Bernard Project, with the help of several celebrities, including Hilary Duff, Selena Gomez, Kelly Osbourne, Kellan Lutz and Kim Kardashian.[290] Spears has also helped several charities during her career, including Madonna's Kabbalah-based Spirituality for Kids,[291] cancer charity Gilda's Club Worldwide,[292] Promises Foundation, and United Way, with the latter two focused on giving families from various disadvantaged situations new hope and stable foundations for the future.[289]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Britney Jean Spears was born in McComb (Mississippi) and raised in rural Louisiana (Kentwood) to Jamie Spears and Lynne Spears. As a child, Britney attended dance classes, and she was great at gymnastics, winning many competitions and the like. But, most of all, Britney loved to sing. At age 8, Britney tried out for MMC (1989), but was turned down due to her young age. This directed her to an off-Broadway show, "Ruthless", for a 2-year run as the title character. At age 11, she again tried for MMC (1989) and, this time, made it as a mouseketeer alongside many stars of today (Justin Timberlake and J.C. Chasez of *NSYNC and Ryan Gosling). Her big break, however, came when she was signed as a Jive Recording Artist in the late 90s. With the release of her debut album, "...Baby One More Time" in early 1999, Britney became an international success, selling 13 million copies of "Baby" and 9 million (as of July 2001) of her sophomore album, "Oops!...I Did It Again", released in May of 2000.
          Born to parents Jamie Spears and Lynne Spears, Britney is their second child of three. Her older brother, Bryan Spears, was born in April 1977 and her younger sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, was born in April 1991. They later moved to Kentwood, Louisiana. From a young age, Britney was always fixing to be a star with idols such as Madonna, Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, the young Britney could always be heard singing, no matter what else was going on around her. After taking extensive dance and vocal lessons and performing in numerous talent shows and fairs, Britney auditioned for MMC (1989) TV series [1989-1994] when she 8, however, she was too young to get the part. Instead, Britney, her mother and baby sister moved to New York where she starred in several TV adverts and an off-Broadway play, "Ruthless", where she was understudy with Natalie Portman. Her love of music and dance took over and, 2 years later, she auditioned for a part on "Mickey Mouse" again and, this time, won the part along with Christina Aguilera and Justin Timberlake. As a Mouseketeer, Britney received extensive training in dance, drama and singing and had to grow up a lot during that time. However, after the show was canceled two years later, Britney returned home and did "the normal teenager thing", attending pool parties and she was also the Homecoming Queen. As a young teenager, Britney soon grew restless again and this time was desperate to become a star yet again. Again, she traveled to New York and sent out demo tapes to various labels including Sony and Mercury, but was turned down. It was Jive Records that finally took the young Britney on and set out on making her the star she is today.She hit the studio with writers/producers, such as Max Martin and Eric Foster White, and the result was her debut album. In late 1998, Jive released her debut single "(Hit me) Baby one more time" which was a pop hit around the Globe, accompanied by the sixteen-year-old first of many controversial acts - the video, which featured Britney dressed in a Catholic schoolgirl uniform, baring her midriff, which was soon to become her trademark. Nonetheless, the single was a smash worldwide and Britney was instantly a household name. She toured with the popular boy band *NSYNC and the single shot to the top of the charts for 3 weeks. Her debut album was released a few months later in early 1999 and, like the single, took to the top of the album charts, where it remained number one for six weeks. The album has now sold millions worldwide and is officially 14 x platinum in the US. Her next controversial act, after the video, was to take the cover of Rolling Stones magazine in a suggestive pose, but as Britney mania took off, the 17-year-old became more and more popular. Appealing to young girls, teenage boys and older men, Britney was on her way, yet nobody could have predicted at that time the impact she would have on Pop Culture. The second single, "Sometimes", was released in June 1999 followed by the top 10 hit "Crazy" in September and "from the bottom of my broken heart" soon after. Britney ended 1999 selling over 10 million copies of her debut and, as the Billboard Top Female Pop Artist (singles and albums), Top New Pop Artist, Top Billboard 200 album Artist and Top 100 singles Artist - female. The American Awards, MTV and Teen Choice awards soon began rolling in and, in early 2000, Britney was nominated for two Grammy awards.At just 18, Britney released her second album in 2000, the #1 smash "Oops! I did it again" and single of the same title, which topped the singles chart for 5 weeks. Smash singles "Stronger" and "Lucky" followed but, it was around this time, that Britney was beginning to raise more than a few eyebrows. It seemed some people weren't too happy with the message she was sending their impressionable young children. On one hand, Britney was the perfect picture of innocence, declaring herself a Virgin until marriage yet, on the other hand, she was sexually charged and provocative, with performance such as the MTV Video Music Awards in 2000, when her costume made her appear scantily-clad. As the young woman was growing up, it seemed there was an internal conflict between her, her management and her mother, all pulling her in different directions. Yet the image the public saw was a gorgeous young woman, beautifully dressed and damn close to perfection, often labeled the "Pop Princess" around the world. Still, the awards kept rolling in and, in early 2001, Britney struck a lucrative deal with Pepsi-Cola for sponsorship and advertising. The 19-year-old was growing up fast, with the media constantly fixed on what she was and wasn't doing, her "rivalry" with former fellow Mouseketeer Christina Aguilera and also her blossoming relationship with *NSYNC heartthrob Justin Timberlake. Britney was keen that people saw her as a growing woman as she began to ready the public for her next LP release in late 2001.In November, she hit the top 10 with the sexually charged "I'm a slave 4 u" which took a completely different turn in musical direction from her previous singles and, in the same month, released her third LP, self-titled "Britney", which shot to the top of the albums charts, breaking records for a female artist. Her performance of "Slave" at the MTV VMA's caused outrage among animal rights campaigners, as she performed with a live giant snake and wearing little herself. It was a far cry from the Britney of just three years ago, and perhaps the critical moment when what some people would say "she started going downhill". Sales of her third album, while impressive, where not nearly as high as her former releases, perhaps due to the increase of new pop female singers flooding the market, yet Britney, still incredibly popular, carried on. In early 2002, the 20-year-old Britney released "I'm not a girl, not yet a woman", taken from the soundtrack of her debut movie Crossroads (2002), which was released in February of that year. She soon after hit the charts with "Overprotected" and also toured worldwide on the "Dream within a dream tour". Yet, it seemed it was all getting too much for Britney, her four year relationship with Timberlake ended suddenly and very publicly and she soon announced she was to take 6 months off, after all, she had achieved so much by such a young age and in such a short space of time. Her star was by no means fading, with "Forbes" declaring her "The World's most powerful celebrity" in mid-2002.While she may have been on a break from her career, she was by no means breaking from the media, who followed her relentlessly, even more keen to track her down and find out what she was up to. Britney was increasingly letting her pop princess crown slip, admitting she had lost her sacred virginity to Timberlake, outside of marriage. Britney could also be seen smoking and drinking to excess on wild nights out and famously breaking down in tears while being interviewed by Diane Sawyer about her parents (who were recently divorced) and her bitter split from Timberlake. Britney was linked to men such as Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit and openly kissed Colin Farrell at a movie premiere. However, she seemed to get herself back together for her new album released in late 2003. In a blitz of publicity which included the infamous "Like a Virgin" performance and Madonna kiss at the MTV Video Music Awards in August that year. The new album, "In The Zone", was a bid to be seen as a woman and caused controversy with songs on it such as "Breathe on Me" and "Touch of my hand" - which was about masturbation - however, the appeal of Britney was still there and the album topped the Billboard 200 albums charts. The first single to be lifted was "Me against the music" a club hit that featured pop icon Madonna and singing with her was a dream come true for Britney. Now 22, it seemed Britney was in a lot more control over her career, yet her personal life still seemed to be slipping. In January 2004, Britney got "married" to childhood friend Jason Allen Alexander in a Las Vegas ceremony. The incident shocked the world, especially when the marriage was annulled 55 hours later and was described as "a joke taken too far" by her management.Britney soon released one of her biggest singles, "Toxic", which topped various charts around the world including the UK and Canadian singles charts. The single was a smash-hit and silenced any critics that said Britney no longer had what it took to make a comeback. She soon began her highly publicized and overtly sexual "Onyx Hotel Tour", which was canceled a few months later after Britney damaged her knee during a video shoot and had to receive medical treatment. Other singles off the album included the gold-selling "Everytime", which topped the UK singles charts and, like usual, also carried a fair amount of controversy for its video, which allegedly depicted the star committing suicide after a fight with her boyfriend, played by Stephen Dorff; however, this was "changed" to an accident in which she drowns yet reincarnates. It was around this time that Britney began dating Kevin Federline, a former backup dancer who she had taken on tour with her a few months previously. The snag here was that Kevin came with baggage - in the form of an "ex" girlfriend, heavily pregnant Moesha (1996) actress Shar Jackson and their young child. Britney and Kevin soon became engaged and, in September 2004, were married in a secret ceremony, soon after the birth of Kevin's second child. That same month, Britney released a single off her upcoming "Greatest Hits" album (released in November 2004) a cover of Bobby Brown's 1988 hit "My Prerogative".Britney was a changed woman, no longer concerned with what the public thought of her or her appearance, she parted ways with her manager who she had had since she was 13, and was increasingly stepping out looking more "trailer trash" than multi-millionaire. In February 2005, Britney won her first Grammy for the single "Toxic" as Best Dance Recording. Just two months later, it was announced Britney was pregnant with her first child. A reality TV Series Britney & Kevin: Chaotic (2005), which featured the pair getting to know each other the previous year, leading up to their wedding aired on UPN and eventually got a world-wide audience, despite harsh criticism. In September 2005, Britney evolved yet again, this time as a devoted wife and mother, with the birth of her first child, a son, who she named Sean Preston. In November of that year, she released a remix album "B in the mix, the Remixes".Looking back over the last seven years of this remarkable lady's career and life, it really is hard to imagine what the face of Pop would look like without her. Here is a 24 year-old woman who has grown in the face of the glaring media from innocent School-girl to sexual pop vixen to young wife and mother. Who knows what is next for Britney? Rumours of a comeback album for 2006 have been circulating for a while and also a few more movie productions, yet one thing is for certain: Britney Spears has worked hard to get to where she is today and by no means will she be disappearing any time soon. Her name and face is legend in the media and celebrity circuit and it's surely only a matter of time before Spears shocks us all again, with her next album or tour or movie or personal move. One thing is for certain, though, the public will be watching.

      I remember I read this harsh review about my show, and one of my friends told me that this was the exact same stuff people said about Madonna. And it's like, she didn't care. Madonna just came out and was herself. I respect that a lot.
      erring to fellow pop-princess and former Mouseketeer Christina Aguilera] Christina and I are friends no matter what the media makes up.
      I would really, really, really like to be a legend like Madonna. Madonna knows what to do next, and when she's performing, the audience is just in awe of her.
      [on her relationship with Justin Timberlake during the MMC (1989)] We were, like, 12 or 13 and it was like, "Hi, do you like me?" It was like puppy love.
      [about the tour to promote her third album eased in November 2001] I really want this to be like shocking and in people's faces and edgy. It's just basically, you know, there's a lot of scrutiny with everything I do. And, it's basically saying that I'm not a little girl anymore and this is me. And just, you know, I have to do what I have to do for me, and that's basically the overall scheme of it, yeah.
      [about recording a song with boyfriend Justin Timberlake for her third album] I have to say I was a little nervous at first. I'm used to producers going in there and it's like work. And, I go in and I work and I do my vocals and work. And, I thought that it was awkward at first because I was nervous recording with him doing my vocals, but then I just totally forgot that he was my boyfriend, and I just said "Britney, just do the vocals, don't be nervous, don't be retarded like this." But, it ended up being fine, actually. At the very end, I got the best vocals I've ever done.
      I love Jessica Simpson. I love her voice. She's amazing. I have her CD, and I have [Christina Aguilera's] CD. I have all of their CDs. They're amazing. You know? I have a lot of respect for them. Anybody who can be in this business . . . the work is so overwhelming sometimes and anybody who can do that I have a lot of respect for.
      I find it so funny that people find me so interesting. And, I hate when they're like "Define your image." I don't know what my image is. I just do my thing.
      Acting is so much fun. It is a different ball game and I want to concentrate on that at the moment. I'm really passionate about what I do. I love entertainment and telling stories to people and I am very lucky that I am doing what I want to do.
      [about her visit to the Playboy mansion] All I remember is seeing a bunch of naked girls and thinking, "I got to get out of here."
      My views on virginity have not changed. I want to wait to have sex until I'm married. I do. I want to wait, but it's hard. I just want to live my life.
      I guess it's because I do have a younger audience that, you know, parents worry about the role model thing. But when I was younger, I looked up to people, but I never wanted to be them. I always had my own identity. I'm an entertainer when I'm on stage, and they need to explain that to their kids. That's not my job to do that.
      There are so many teenagers out there that dress more provocatively than I do, and no one says anything about them.
      How can I explain this? I don't see myself -- hand on the Bible -- I know I'm not ugly, but I don't see myself as a sex symbol or this goddess-attractive beautiful person at all. When I'm on stage, that's my time to do my thing and go there and be that, and it's fun. It's exhilarating just to be something that you're not. And, people tend to believe it. I guess I just pull it off very well.
      Who really cares if I've had sex? It's nobody's business. Trust me, I'm not going to have a press conference to announce it. If I mess up, I'm human. If I have a drink or I'm with someone, I'm human. I'm no different than anyone else my age.
      Selling 5 million records is still good. I don't want to get jaded thinking I have to sell 10 million every time. It's not about that.
      I suck at flirting. There's one thing I don't understand about Hollywood. How they have a relationship, end it, and go right into the next. It's hard for a woman in this industry. Either the guy's going to be really intimidated, or they're going to kiss your ass. I'm just a girl wanting a guy to love me.
      I feel like a totally different person than I was two years ago. I feel like so much of my innocence is gone. I'm still me, but this business makes you grow up so fast.
      Would you go into a CD store and steal a CD? It's the same thing, people going into the computers and loggin' on and stealing our music.
      [about her breakup with boyfriend Justin Timberlake] The most painful thing I have ever experienced was that breakup. We were together so long and I had this vision. You think you're going to spend the rest of your life together. Where I come from, the woman is the homemaker, and that's how I was brought up -- you cook for your kids.
      If I was to pick a cartoon character I am most like, I would say Daisy Duck, because she is very stubborn, she has a very feminine sense and she knows what she likes.
      As an artist, I would probably go on stage and bump and grind with a dancer. In real life, never.
      I don't listen to anybody. Nobody can tell me anything. I'm stubborn. If somebody tells me not to do something, I do it. But I do listen to Madonna. For some reason I listen to her. I know that sounds really silly. It's nice to have somebody just to ask questions to. She's a visual artist and a deep artist as well. I like the way she thinks. I wish I could be inside her head. I like Madonna's career, and what she's done with her family.
      I've got an amazing group of people around me and my family at home. If I don't make my bed and wash the dishes at home, I'm in trouble.
      I'm not the type of person that can be cooped up in the hotel room being served all the time. I can't deal with that. I've got to do normal things.
      Performing is what I like most. I find the studio very confining. You can do a lot in there, and you get the opportunity to try again and again. But on stage you have the adrenalin going and you've got one shot and the energy is so intense.
      It feels like I've been dreaming this forever and then it happens and it feels like a whirlwind. I'm constantly traveling and I miss my friends.
      [Justin Timberlake] was my first kiss. We were playing "Truth or Dare" and listening to Janet Jackson. I was 12. His friend dared him to kiss me, so that was my first kiss.
      This is my dream come true. I can't believe this is happening right now. I can't believe I even have a movie. I feel very blessed to be where I am right now.
      [on being photographed without panties] Anyway, thank God for Victoria's Secret's new underwear line!
      [on why she has yet to tour Australia] I really love Australia, great place, but it's just so far away to go to for a concert, and that makes it hard - but I'll definitely take a course there for a tour next time. I'd really love to.
      arding the policies of President George W. Bush regarding the invasion of Iraq] I think we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes and we should just support that.
      I've never really wanted to go to Japan. Simply because I don't like eating fish. And I know that's very popular out there in Africa.
      [on receiving a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame] I'm seriously speechless right now. This is something that I've dreamed about since I was a little girl. I can't believe I'm actually here with all of you amazing fans. Hello?
      How do I keep slim? Having two boys definitely helps, and I love to dance. It's the best way to stay in shape.
      Sometimes I keep it simple and don't wear much make-up - just a little mascara and lip gloss. Other times, I'll play around and do heavier make-up or some fun lipstick.
      I'm really just a boring homebody who loves staying home with my kids and that's where I'm the happiest.
      I'm at such a different point in my life now than I was back then. You have to think about all your decisions so much more carefully, because they are affecting your kids too. My priorities have changed, and I do everything for [the boys]. They remind me what life is really all about.
      [on her children]: They are my biggest fans. I make up songs and sing to them all the time, they like to watch me dance. In fact, they join in and do their own moves! I couldn't go on tour without them! I'm always very busy when I'm on the road, but I make sure to have quality time with them every single day.
      I love Adele. Her voice is just an amazing soulful sound. Her voice stays with you. I love Robyn Carlsson, her 'Body Talk' album is different and interesting.
      I believe that all women can create their own world where they shine the brightest. It's all about having the power and confidence to be yourself.
      (on starting her career as a teenager) I was having fun then, but I would stay true to that, you know? I'm still pretty much the same person I was when I started this, but in the beginning, I think I was fearful. So I'd say, just try to embrace moments more. To have a good time with life and don't take it too seriously.
      My all time favorite outfit? Probably the school uniform. I think because it was my first video I ever did and the first experience with everything. That's in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame. (She wore the school uniform outfit in her song: Hit Me Baby One More Time).
      [on her career after being in the music business for more than a decade] I don't really have anything to prove at this point. I just do it for fun and see what happens.
      [on turning 30 in 2011] I hear the older you get, the wiser you get and the more you know what you want. Hopefully it'll be a good year.
      It's the best feeling in the world when I'm on stage and I'm singing and the fans are singing the words with me.
      These parents, they think I'm a role model for their kids, that their kids look at me as some sort of idol. But it's the parents' job to make sure their kids don't turn out that shallow. That's not my responsibility. I'm not responsible for your kid.
      My family, we walked around the house naked. By the time I was 13, may dad was like, "Uh, Britney, it's time to start covering yourself up." I'm very free like that.
      [on the idea of retiring] I have thought about it. If I happen to have another baby or something like that, I'd probably move back to Louisiana. I do miss Louisiana. I miss the people. I miss the food. I miss the way of life, how everything is really simple. There's no traffic like there is in L.A. It's really nice... I think right now is my time to perform and do what I'm doing.
      Don't care too much 'bout what other people think. What really matters is your own point of view.

One of the most controversial and successful female vocalists of the 2000s, Britney Spears (along with the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync) spearheaded the rise of post-millennial teen pop. She then spearheaded what looked like her own demise, with her questionable parenting, substance abuse and generally bizarre behavior becoming constant tabloid fodder. But as the 2000s closed, Spears seemed to have righted her ship and still held much of her popular appeal.
A former child actress (she, like Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera, was a regular on "The New Mickey Mouse Club" from 1993-94), Spears early on cultivated a mixture of innocence and experience that generated lots of cash. Her first single, " . . . Baby One More Time," paired a vaguely S&M lyric (the ellipse follows the words "Hit me") with a fluffy, Europop-style big beat, and a video in which the singer paraded around in a Catholic schoolgirl outfit. Released in late 1998, it went to Number One, and the album of the same name, issued in January 1999, followed suit, debuting in the top spot. . . . Baby One More Time delivered further hits in "Sometimes" (Number 21, 1999), "(You Drive Me) Crazy" (Number 10, 1999) and "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" (Number 14, 2000).
Wasting little time, Spears, who was born December 2nd, 1981 in McComb, Mississippi, and her producers and writers — a team that included Swedish hitmaker Max Martin — returned in 2000 with Oops! . . . I Did It Again (Number One, 2000), whose title smash (Number Nine, 2000) made the titillation of her debut even more explicit, with a the chorus that insisted, "I'm not that innocent." Further hits from Oops included "Lucky" (Number 23, 2000) and "Stronger" (Number 11, 2000).
Spears' third album, Britney (Number One, 2001), delivered smaller hits, this time emphasizing raunchiness without coyness, particularly on the Neptunes-produced "I'm a Slave 4 U" (Number 27, 2001), featuring a greased-up Spears moving in a more bluntly sexual direction than ever — a maneuver made even more bold-faced when Spears French-kissed Madonna during a performance on the MTV Video Music Awards in September 2003. (At the same event two years before she writhed with an albino python.) Britney was also a maturity move on the artist's part: she helped write five of its songs and issued the image-conscious "Overprotected" as a single (Number 86, 2002). In 2002, Spears hit the big screen in Crossroads, a movie that was panned by critics but still drew her fans to theaters.
In November 2003, Spears released her fourth album, In the Zone (Number One), whose first single, "Me Against the Music," featured a cameo by the woman she'd famously kissed on TV. Despite Spears' and Madonna's combined star power, the song only got to Number 35. Spears fared better with ballad "Everytime" (Number 15, 2004) and especially "Toxic" (Number 9, 2004), which won a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording and spawned cover versions by rock bands. The album featured a mix of producers, including Moby, Bloodshy and Avant, R. Kelly and the Matrix. Spears capped her early career with Greatest Hits: My Prerogative (Number Four, 2004), featuring a defensive-sounding cover of the Bobby Brown hit; she next released the time-buying B in the Mix: The Remixes (Number 134, 2005) while pondering her next move.
By this point, Spears had become more of a tabloid celebrity than a pop star. She'd dated Justin Timberlake for four years (1998-2002), and he'd featured a Britney look-alike in his video for the single "Cry Me a River," implying their break-up was due to infidelity on her end. She was involved in a disastrous restaurant in New York, Nyla, which closed shop within a year. In January 2004 she married a childhood friend, Jason Alexander (not the Seinfeld actor) in a quickie Las Vegas ceremony; it was annulled within three days. That September she married again, this time to dancer and aspiring rapper Kevin Federline, who would later record a widely panned rap album; the pair starred in a reality show for UPN called Britney & Kevin: Chaotic that chronicled their raunchy relationship via home-video footage shot while Spears was on the European leg of her Onyx Hotel Tour. Spears hurt her leg during the filming of the video for In the Zone's "Outrageous," which featured Snoop Dogg, and had to cancel the rest of that tour. Shortly afterwards, she and Federline had a son, Sean Preston; just shy of one year later, she gave birth again, to Jayden James. Two months later, in November 2007, Spears filed for divorce.
Celebrity weeklies pounced on the news of Spears' domestic breakdown, and the paparazzi, who had always closely tailed the star, amped up their coverage of Spears. Everything from her parenting to alleged substance-abuse issues made headlines, and after a brief stint as Paris Hilton's party buddy, Spears spent one night at an overseas drug-rehabilitation facility before flying back to California, where she stopped at a hair salon and shaved her own head in full view of paparazzi cameras. As she continued to battle with Federline over custody of their two sons, Spears returned to rehab, this time for a month, under the advisement of her parents and longtime manager, Larry Rudolph. When she emerged, Spears cut ties with Rudolph and others who had urged her to seek professional help, and began to act erratically in public, hooking up with a paparazzo named Adnan Ghalib, and spending time with a new manager figure named Sam Lutfi.
In October 2007, Spears released her fifth studio album, Blackout (Number Two), which was mostly produced by Nate "Danja" Hills, the Timbaland protégé. Though she barely promoted the album, it generated the first-single smash "Gimme More" (Number Three, 2007) and the paparazzi kiss-off "Piece of Me" (Number 18), as well as "Break the Ice" (Number 43, 2008). Expectations were high for Spears' return to the MTV Video Music Awards stage the month before the album's release, but Spears' show-opening performance of "Gimme More" was seen as a disaster that failed to feature Spears' signature dancing skills.
In January 2008, Spears refused to relinquish her sons to Federline's bodyguards and barricaded herself in her Los Angeles home. After being hospitalized twice in psychiatric wards, her divorced parents — who she had shunned since her month-long stay in rehab — returned to her life and her father, Jamie, was granted legal conservatorship of her affairs. In the months following, Spears appeared to tame her wild ways and was once again granted visits with her children (Federline won custody in October 2007). She made two appearances on the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother, and returned to the studio to work on tracks for her sixth album.
Circus arrived on Spears' 27th birthday and debuted at Number One in 2008. The album's high-profile release was preceded by a documentary called Britney: For the Record that aired on MTV and examined Spears' experience grappling with fame and preparing to return to the spotlight. Circus included the buzzing first single "Womanizer" (Number One, 2008), the title track (Number Three, 2008) — which addressed the public's never-ending fascination with watching Britney — and "If U Seek Amy," a saucy uptempo with a Rated R chorus (say the title fast). Danja returned as a producer, along with Max Martin, Bloodshy and Avant and Guy Sigsworth. In March 2009, Spears hit the road for the first time since her aborted 2004 outing on the Big Top-themed The Circus Starring Britney Spears tour. Spears faced widespread criticism for lip-synching onstage, but completed the nearly 100-date jaunt — one of the top-grossing tours of 2009 — without major incident.
Spears released her third compilation, The Singles Collection (Number 22, 2009), to mark a decade in the record industry. The disc featured one new song, "3" (Number One, 2009), which strived to cement Spears' commitment to controversial lyrics (the track describes the singer's apparent proclivity for threesomes). Spears didn't do press to promote the album's release, and remained uncharacteristically quiet since the conclusion of her Circus tour.

=======================================================
More than any other single artist, Britney Spears was the driving force behind the return of teen pop in the late '90s. The blockbuster success of the Spice Girls and Backstreet Boys certainly paved the way for her own commercial breakthrough, but Spears didn't just become a star -- she was a bona fide pop phenomenon. Not only did she sell millions of records, she was a media fixture regardless of what she was (or wasn't) doing; among female singers of the era (many of whom followed in her footsteps), her celebrity star power was rivaled only by Jennifer Lopez. From the outset, Spears' sex appeal was an important part of her image. The video for her debut single, "...Baby One More Time," outfitted her in full Catholic-school regalia and sent her well on the way to becoming an international sex symbol. Yet Spears' handlers seemed to be trying to have it both ways -- there was a definite tension between the wholesome innocence Spears tried to project for her female audience, and the titillating sexuality that enticed so many male fans. Those marketing tactics made Spears a somewhat controversial figure, the subject of endless debates concerning appropriate role models for teenage girls. Early on, Spears tried to defuse the controversy by preaching abstinence until marriage, and even denied that she was consciously cultivating such a sexualized image. Of course, the more provocative and revealing her on-stage wardrobe became, the less plausible that claim seemed. But apart from her ability to tiptoe the line between virginal coquette and brazen tart, Spears had a secret weapon in Swedish pop mastermind Max Martin, who had a hand in the vast majority of her hits as a writer and/or producer. With Martin crafting the sort of contemporary dance-pop and sentimental ballads that made stars of the Backstreet Boys, Spears kept on delivering the goods commercially, as her first three albums all topped the charts.
Britney Jean Spears was born December 2, 1981, in the small town of Kentwood, Louisiana, and began performing as a singer and dancer at a young age. With a nationally televised appearance on Star Search already under her belt, Spears auditioned for the Disney Channel's The New Mickey Mouse Club at age eight. The producers turned her down as too young, but one of them took an interest and introduced her to an agent in New York. Spears spent the next three years studying at the Professional Performing Arts School, and also appeared in several television commercials and off-Broadway plays. At 11, she returned to The New Mickey Mouse Club for a second audition, and this time made the cut. Although her fellow Mouseketeers included an impressive array of future stars -- *NSYNC's Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez, Christina Aguilera, and Felicity actress Keri Russell -- the show was canceled after Spears' second season. She returned to New York at age 15 and set about auditioning for pop bands and recording demo tapes, one of which eventually landed her a deal with Jive Records.
Spears entered the studio with top writer/producers like Eric Foster White (Boyzone, Whitney Houston, Backstreet Boys) and Max Martin (Ace of Base, Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC). In late 1998, Jive released her debut single, the Martin-penned "...Baby One More Time." Powered by its video, in which Spears and a troupe of dancers were dressed as Catholic-school jailbait, the single shot to the top of the Billboard charts. When Spears' debut album of the same title was released in early 1999, it entered the charts at number one and stayed there for six weeks. Once the ubiquitous lead single died down, the album kept spinning off hits: the Top Ten "(You Drive Me) Crazy," the near-Top 20 ballad "Sometimes," and the Top 20 "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart." By the end of 1999, ...Baby One More Time had sold ten million copies, and went on to sell a good three million more on top of that. Its success touched off a wave of young pop divas that included Christina Aguilera, P!nk, Jessica Simpson, and Mandy Moore. Spears was a superstar, drooled over in countless magazines, including a Rolling Stone cover that prompted immediate speculation about the still 17-year-old having received breast implants. 
By the time ...Baby One More Time finally started to lose steam on the singles and album charts, Spears was ready to release her follow-up. Oops!...I Did It Again appeared in the spring of 2000, and the title track was an instant smash, racing into the Top Ten. The album itself entered the charts at number one and sold over a million copies in its first week of release, setting a new record for single-week sales by a female artist. Follow-up singles included "Lucky," the gold-selling "Stronger," and "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know," which was co-written by country diva Shania Twain and her producer Mutt Lange. A year after its release, Oops!...I Did It Again had sold over nine million copies. Rumors that Spears was dating *NSYNC heartthrob (and fellow ex-Mouseketeer) Justin Timberlake were eventually confirmed, which only added to the media attention lavished on her.
For her next album, Spears looked ahead to a not-so-distant future when both she and much of her audience would be growing up. Released in late 2001, Britney tried to present the singer as a more mature young woman, and was accompanied by mild hints that her personal life wasn't always completely puritanical. It became her third straight album to debut at number one, although this time around the singles weren't as successful; "I'm a Slave 4 U," "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman," and "Overprotected" all missed the Top Ten. In early 2002, Spears' feature-film debut, Crossroads, hit theaters, but its commercial performance was somewhat disappointing; moreover, her romance with Timberlake fizzled not long after. Spears next made a cameo appearance in Mike Myers' Austin Powers: Goldmember, and contributed a remix of "Boys" to the soundtrack. Meanwhile, sales of Britney stalled at four million copies, perhaps in part because a new breed of teenage female singer/songwriters, like Michelle Branch and Avril Lavigne, was emerging as an alternative to the highly packaged teen queens. Spears took a break from recording and performing for several months, and began work on a new album in early 2003. The results, In the Zone, reflected a wish to be taken seriously as a mature (though still highly sexualized) adult. Predictably, it topped the charts and launched several singles into orbit, including the musically adventurous "Toxic," "Everytime," and "Me Against the Music."
In the Zone hit number one on the Billboard 200, and "Toxic" snagged a Grammy for Best Dance Recording. But by 2004, there were no longer any illusions of Britney's personal life being all wholesome candy canes and kisses. First there was the star's bizarre two-day marriage to childhood friend Jason Alexander, followed by the controversial, highly sexualized Onyx Hotel tour, which was eventually canceled (allegedly because of a knee injury) despite positive financial numbers. Starbucks and cigarettes were Britney's constant accessories in the endless paparazzi photos, and the revelation of her relationship with former backup dancer Kevin Federline made the tabloids even more ravenous. Spears and Federline married in September and were tabloid regulars in the months after the ceremony. (A photo of a barefoot Britney leaving a dingy gas station bathroom made the Internet rounds.) The couple also starred in Chaotic, a UPN reality show consisting mostly of their own home videos that was met with howls from the critics and blogs. 
The year 2005 was no less eventful for Spears. She released Greatest Hits: My Prerogative that January, but it was the announcement of her pregnancy that really garnered the headlines. Sean Preston Federline was born in September, and a bidding war ensued for first rights to the baby photos. As the hubbub surrounding Sean's birth continued, Britney released a remix album just in time for the holiday season. In 2006, Spears discovered she was pregnant again; shortly after the birth of her second son, Jayden James Federline, she divorced Federline, thus sparking a long string of custody battles that were eventually settled in Federline's favor. Following another headline-grabbing incident in early 2007 (in which Spears spontaneously shaved her head at a salon in Tarzana, California, much to the delight of nearby photographers), Spears sought help at Malibu's Promises Treatment Center. After leaving the center, she began working on her comeback album and performed a few small shows at House of Blues locations in Los Angeles, San Diego, Anaheim, and Las Vegas that May. Despite ongoing turmoil in her life that summer and fall -- including a disastrous performance at MTV's Video Music Awards -- Blackout arrived in October 2007. It proved to be her least successful album to date, charting three Top 40 hits but failing to achieve platinum certification within its first year of release. 
Spears' public image was dealt more blows in early 2008 when she lost custody of her children, made several court appearances, and was placed on involuntary psychiatric hold twice in one month. Blackout nevertheless won several MTV-sponsored awards, including Album of the Year from the Europe Music Awards in November 2008. That same fall, the lead-off single from Spears' next record, "Womanizer," became her first number one single in nearly a decade. The full-length Circus arrived in December, featuring a mix of syrupy ballads and uptempo dance numbers that were designed to fuel Spears' comeback. In 2009, the single "3" followed "Womanizer" to the top, and appeared on her career-spanning compilation The Singles Collection. In 2011, Spears returned with the studio album Femme Fatale, featuring the single "Hold It Against Me," which became her fourth single to top the Billboard Hot 100. The second single, the Ke$ha co-written "Till the World Ends," didn't top the charts but it was a bigger hit, going double platinum in the US. 
Britney supported Femme Fatale with an international tour that ran until the end of 2011; at the end of the year, the home video Live: The Femme Fatale Tour was released. Spears made a splashy return to television in 2012 when she signed to be one of the celebrity judges on the second season of the U.S. version of Simon Cowell's The X Factor. The show returned in the fall of 2012. Spears did not return to the show for its third series. 
Also in 2012, Britney appeared on will.i.am's track "Scream and Shout." This was the beginning of a greater partnership, as will.i.am wound up as the executive producer for her eighth studio album, Britney Jean. Preceded by the single "Work Bitch" -- along with a Britney cameo on Miley Cyrus' 2013 album Bangerz and the announcement of a two-year residency in Las Vegas -- Britney Jean appeared during the first week of December 2013. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi

Britney Spears Biography | Baby Boy | Pic | Wedding | My Prerogative | Picture | Bio | Kevin Federline | Photo
No doubt, Britney Spears has had a crazy life. She got married young, had two kids and then got divorced. Then she went a bit "cuckoo," but now things seem to be back to normal ... or are they?
Britney, the middle child of three kids, wanted to be a star from a really young age. Ever since she was 7 or 8 years old, every time her mom had guests over she would perform for them in front of the TV. Even in school, Britney stood out. Instead of playing with the other kids at recess, she would gather her friends and hold Star Search competitions in the playground
At 8 years old, Brit auditioned for the Disney Channel's New Mickey Mouse Club, but didn't get the part. Instead, she went on the talent competition show, Star Search, in 1992 and showcased her singing talents to the world.
Britney tried again for the New Mickey Mouse Club when she was 11. This time, she was chosen for the cast, which included other rising stars like Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera and Keri Russell. Brit was on the show for two seasons until it got cancelled. That's when she got serious about developing her musical career.
Britney landed a contract with Jive Records and, in December 1998, released her first single, Baby One More Time. The catchy pop tune topped the charts, partly because of its music video, in which Britney wore a skimpy version of a Catholic schoolgirl uniform. She took a lot of heat from parents for the outfit, but fired back at by insisting that she was a sweet, innocent Southern girl at heart.
At the 1999 Billboard Music Awards, Britney picked up three awards, including Female Album Artist of the Year, Female Artist of the Year and Best New Artist of the Year and claimed her spot as part of a teenage pop music wave, which included Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson.
In 2000, Britney released her second No. 1 hit single, Oops! I Did It Again. The song sold over 1 million copies in the first week. Her personal life was also getting more media attention, as rumors circulated that she was dating Justin Timberlake, who was then part of the hit pop group [kwlink ]'N Sync[/kwlink].
In 2001, Britney started making moves to lose her "good girl" image, while also taking her music in a different direction with tracks like I'm a Slave 4 U. When she performed that song at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, she turned heads by dancing with a seven-foot albino python around her neck and wearing a barely-there dress.
In 2002, Brit got the lead role in the feature film Crossroads, which was loved by fans and hated by the critics. It ended up making more than $37 million at the box office. Later that spring, she and JT broke up.
The next year, brit made more headlines when she shared a kiss with Christina Aguilera and Madonna at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. Britney explained her actions by saying Madonna was a really big role model for her, and that she used to dance around the house in her short tops and sing and dream about being just like the Material Girl.
Brit's next single, Toxic, won her a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording ... and then the pop princess was back to stirring up controversy. In January 2004, she married her childhood friend Jason Alexander in Las Vegas, but that was ended two days later. She then got involved with backup dancer Kevin Federline, who's supposed "other" girlfriend, Shar Jackson, was pregnant with their second child. Britney also had to have surgery to correct a knee injury, forcing her to cancel the last part of her tour. Despite the setback, Britney and Kevin got hitched on September 18, 2004, in California.
Shortly after the wedding, Brit released Greatest Hits: My Prerogative - it seemed to be her way of talking back to her critics and lashing out about the media frenzy that continually surrounded her. The single didn't do as well as previous songs, but it didn't seem to phase Brit. She and Kevin were expecting their first child together in April 2005 and were busy taping their reality show Britney and Kevin: Chaotic, which told the story of their early relationship through personal videos. That September, Britney gave birth to her first son Sean Preston.
As a new mom, Britney found herself in trouble in February 2006 after she was caught driving her car with her baby son in her lap. Her parenting skills became a subject of national debate, and critics said she was sending the wrong message to millions of her fans. Britney quickly apologized, saying she had only been trying to get away from the paparazzi, who were constantly hounding and following her.
In September 2006, Britney had her second son, Jayden James. Unfortunately, a new baby couldn't save her marriage, and she and Kevin divorced. Once single, Britney started partying again, and hanging out with the ultimate party girl, Paris Hilton. She also reportedly checked in and out rehab and then shaved her head in a California beauty salon while the paparazzi took pictures in February 2007.
By summer, Britney and Kevin were in the middle of a full-blown custody battle. Kevin wanted full custody of the kids, saying Britney was not mentally healthy enough to take care of the boys. Britney also stopped talking to her mom at that time. Despite everything she was going through, she released the single Gimme More from her new album. While people loved the songs, her performance at that year's MTV Video Music Awards totally bombed. Britney seemed nervous on stage, missing her steps and poorly lip-syncing. And the next month, she was charged in connection to a hit-and-run incident in a parking lot.
Britney wasn't the only member of her family making headlines in 2007. Her baby sister Jamie Lynn Spears, announced that she was pregnant at age 16, and instantly became a controversial symbol of teen pregnancy. And, despite the success of her Blackout album, Britney appeared to have yet another breakdown in January 2008. She was taken to the hospital for psychiatric evaluation when she refused to return her sons to their dad after a court-appointed visit. The result: Kevin got full custody of the two boys.
Rumors swirled about Britney's condition, and some people guessed she had bipolar disorder. While in the hospital, Britney got caught in a power struggle between her parents, Jamie and Lynne, and her manager Sam Lufti. Mom and dad claimed Sam was a bad influence on britney and was trying to control her life. Her dad even went to court and got full control over Britney's personal, professional and medical matters.
Only two months after her personal crisis, Britney got back into the spotlight with a guest appearance on the sitcom How I Met Your Mother. She also released her next recording Circus, which instantly topped the album charts, thanks to the success of her single Womanizer, proving Britney was still a powerful force in the world of pop music.
Britney went on to make an amazing return at the MTV Video Music Awards, winning three awards for her hit single Piece of Me. She went on tour and Kevin even joined her for a while so she could spend some time with her sons. Now, Brit seems to have settled down, telling Glamour magazine that "I don't like going out...I love my home and staying in bed and watching Dancing with the Stars or reading. I'm kind of boring."
