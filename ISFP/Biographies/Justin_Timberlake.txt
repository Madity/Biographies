Justin Randall Timberlake (born January 31, 1981) is an American singer-songwriter, actor, record producer, businessman, and philanthropist. Born in Memphis, Tennessee, he appeared on the television shows Star Search and The All-New Mickey Mouse Club as a child. In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as one of the two lead vocalists and youngest member of the boy band 'N Sync, whose launch was financed by Lou Pearlman.
During the group's hiatus, Timberlake released his solo studio albums Justified (2002) and FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006); the former spawned hits "Cry Me a River" and "Rock Your Body", while the latter debuted atop the U.S. Billboard 200 and produced the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "SexyBack", "My Love", and "What Goes Around... Comes Around". With each album exceeding sales of seven million copies worldwide, he was established as one of the most commercially successful singers of the decade. From 2007 through 2012, Timberlake focused on his acting career, effectively putting his music career on hiatus; he held starring roles in the films The Social Network, Bad Teacher, In Time, and Friends with Benefits.
In 2013, Timberlake resumed his music career with his third and fourth albums The 20/20 Experience and The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2. The former became the best-selling record of the year and spawned hits "Suit & Tie" and "Mirrors", while the latter is preceded by lead single "Take Back the Night" and followed by "Not a Bad Thing". Timberlake's work has earned him nine Grammy Awards and four Emmy Awards. His other ventures include record label Tennman Records, fashion label William Rast, and the restaurants Destino and Southern Hospitality.
Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981 in Memphis, Tennessee, to Randall Timberlake and Lynn (Bomar) Harless.[1][2] His paternal grandfather was a Baptist minister.[3] Timberlake grew up in Shelby Forest, a small community between Memphis and Millington.[4] He has two half-brothers, Jonathan (born 1993) and Steven Robert (born August 14, 1998), from Randall's second marriage to Lisa Perry. His half-sister Laura Katherine died shortly after birth on May 14, 1997, and is mentioned in his acknowledgments in the album *NSYNC as "My Angel in Heaven."[5] He was inspired to become a performer by Janet Jackson, saying "She didn't just stand there and sing her song," fascinated by her "energy and exuberance."[6] At the age of 11, Timberlake appeared on the television show Star Search, performing country music songs as "Justin Randall."[4] In 1993 and 1994, he was a cast member in The Mickey Mouse Club, where his castmates included future girlfriend and pop superstar Britney Spears, future tourmate Christina Aguilera, future bandmate JC Chasez, and future movie actor Ryan Gosling.[7] In 1995, Timberlake recruited Chasez to be in an all-male singing group, organized by boy band manager Lou Pearlman,[8] that eventually became 'N Sync.
The boy band 'N Sync formed in 1995, and began their career in 1996 in Europe; Timberlake and Chasez served as its two lead singers.[9] In 1998, the group rose to prominence in the United States with the release of their self-titled debut studio album, which sold 11 million copies and included hit single "Tearin' Up My Heart". Their second album No Strings Attached (2000) sold 2.4 million copies in the first week,[10] and included a #1 single, "It's Gonna Be Me". 'N Sync's third album Celebrity (2001) was also financially successful. Upon the completion of the Celebrity Tour, the group went into hiatus in 2002. In its lifetime, 'N Sync was internationally famous and performed at the Academy Awards,[11] the Olympics,[12] and the Super Bowl,[13] as well as selling more than 50 million copies worldwide,[14] becoming the third-best selling boy band in history.[15]
In late 1999, Timberlake made his acting debut in the Disney Channel movie Model Behavior. He played Jason Sharpe, a model who falls in love with a waitress after mistaking her for another model. It was released on March 12, 2000.[16] The rise of his own stardom and the general decline in the popularity of boy bands led to the dissolution of 'N Sync. Band member Lance Bass was openly critical of Timberlake's actions in his memoir Out of Sync.[17]
In August 2002, Timberlake performed at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, where he premiered his debut solo single "Like I Love You";[18] it peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100.[19] His debut solo studio album Justified was released in November[20] and debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 439,000 copies, fewer than previous 'N Sync releases. It went on to sell over three million copies in the U.S. and more than seven million copies worldwide.[21] Its R&B influence, provided by hip-hop producers The Neptunes and Timbaland,[22] was complimented by music critics. The album spawned the top 10 singles "Cry Me a River" and "Rock Your Body".[19] In summer 2003, Timberlake and Christina Aguilera headlined the Justified/Stripped Tour.[23] Later that year he recorded a song "I'm Lovin' It", used by McDonald's as the theme to its "I'm Lovin' It" campaign. The deal with McDonald's earned Timberlake an estimated $6 million. A tour titled Justified and Lovin' It Live was included with the deal.[24] Timberlake was featured on Nelly's song, "Work It", which was remixed and included on Nelly's 2003 remix album.[25]
In February 2004, during the halftime show of the Super Bowl XXXVIII broadcast on the CBS television network, Timberlake performed with Janet Jackson before a television audience of more than 140 million viewers. At the end of the performance, as the song drew to a close, Timberlake tore off a part of Jackson's black leather costume in a "costume reveal" meant to accompany a portion of the song lyrics. Jackson's representative explained Timberlake intended "to pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra. The garment collapsed and her breast was accidentally revealed."[26] Part of the costume detached, and Jackson's breast was briefly exposed.[27] Timberlake apologized for the incident, stating he was "sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl...."[28] The phrase "wardrobe malfunction" has since been used by the media to refer to the incident and has entered pop culture.[29] Timberlake and Jackson were threatened with exclusion from the 2004 Grammy Awards unless they agreed to apologize on screen at the event. Timberlake attended and issued a scripted apology when accepting the first of two Grammy Awards he received that night (Best Pop Vocal Album for Justified and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for "Cry Me a River").[30] He had also been nominated for Album of the Year for Justified, Record of the Year for "Cry Me a River", and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for "Where Is the Love?" with The Black Eyed Peas.[31]
After the Super Bowl controversy, Timberlake put his recording career on hold to act in several films, having starred in a few feature films earlier in his career.[7] The first role he took during this time was as a journalist in Edison Force, filmed in 2004 and received a direct-to-video release on July 18, 2006.[32] He also appeared in the films Alpha Dog, Black Snake Moan, Richard Kelly's Southland Tales, and voiced Prince Artie Pendragon in the animated film Shrek the Third, released on May 18, 2007.[33] He also appeared as a young Elton John, in the video for John's song "This Train Don't Stop There Anymore".[34] Timberlake was considered to play the role of Roger Davis in the film version of the rock musical Rent, but director Chris Columbus had insisted that only the original Broadway members could convey the true meaning of Rent.[35]
He continued to record with other artists. After "Where Is the Love?", he again collaborated with the Black Eyed Peas on the 2005 track "My Style" from their album Monkey Business.[36] When recording the 2005 single "Signs" with Snoop Dogg, Timberlake discovered a throat condition.[37] Nodules were subsequently removed from his throat in an operation that took place on May 5, 2005.[38] He was advised not to sing or speak loudly for at least a few months.[39] In 2005, he began his own record company, JayTee Records.[40]

Timberlake released his second studio album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, on September 12, 2006. The album, which Timberlake created from 2005 to 2006, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart, selling 684,000 copies its first week.[41] It is the biggest album for pre-orders on iTunes, and beat Coldplay's record for the biggest one-week sales of a digital album.[42] The album was produced by Timbaland and Danja (who produced a bulk of the album), will.i.am, Rick Rubin and Timberlake himself, and features guest vocals by Snoop Dogg, Three 6 Mafia, T.I. and will.i.am.[43] A studio representative described it as being "all about sexiness" and aiming for "an adult feel".[38]
The album's lead single, "SexyBack", was performed by Timberlake at the opening of the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, where it remained for seven consecutive weeks.[44] "My Love", the album's second single, also produced by Timbaland and featuring rapper T.I., reached number one on the Hot 100, as did third single "What Goes Around... Comes Around". The song is reported to have been inspired by the break-up of his childhood friend and business partner, Trace Ayala, with actress Elisha Cuthbert.[45] In October 2006, Timberlake said that he would focus on his music career rather than his film roles, specifying that leaving the music industry would be a "dumb thing to do at this point".[44] He was the special guest performer at the 2006 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show for being where he sang SexyBack. In January 2007, Timberlake embarked on the FutureSex/LoveShow tour. "Summer Love/Set the Mood Prelude" was the fourth U.S. single off the album, and the next single in the UK was "LoveStoned/I Think She Knows Interlude". The song "Give It to Me", a Timbaland single on which Timberlake guests with Nelly Furtado, reached the Hot 100 number-one spot.[46]
In February 2008, Timberlake was awarded two Grammy Awards. At the 50th Grammy Awards ceremony, he won the Male Pop Performance Award for "What Goes Around...Comes Around", and the Dance Recording Award for "LoveStoned/I Think She Knows".[47]
The song "4 Minutes", was first played by Timbaland at Philadelphia's Jingle Ball on December 17, 2007.[48] When released on March 17, 2008, "4 Minutes" was revealed to be a duet between Timberlake and Madonna, with backing vocals by Timbaland. It was lead single from Madonna's eleventh studio album Hard Candy, which featured four other song-writing collaborations with Timberlake. The single was an international hit, topping the charts in over 21 countries worldwide.[49] Timberlake also appears in the music video, which was directed by Jonas & François. On March 30, 2008, Timberlake performed the song at Madonna's Hard Candy Promo Show at Roseland Ballroom in New York City.[50] On November 6, 2008, Timberlake performed the song with Madonna on the Los Angeles stop of her Sticky & Sweet Tour.[51]
In June 2007, Timberlake co-wrote, produced and provided vocals for the songs "Nite Runner" and "Falling Down" for Duran Duran's album Red Carpet Massacre, released on November 13, 2007. "Falling Down" had been released as a single in the UK on the previous day.[52] Also in 2007, Timberlake made an appearance on 50 Cent's third album, Curtis. Timberlake, along with Timbaland, is featured on a track called "Ayo Technology", which was the album's fourth single. Also, another possible collaboration was to occur with Lil Wayne for his album Tha Carter III with Nelly Furtado and Timbaland.[53] With the wrapping up of the FutureSex/LoveSounds tour of Australasia and the Middle East in November 2007, Timberlake resumed his film career. Projects underway early in 2008 were starring roles in Mike Myers' comedy The Love Guru (released June 20, 2008) and Mike Meredith's drama The Open Road (released August 28, 2009). In March 2008 it was announced that he was to be an executive producer in an American adaptation of the hit Peruvian comedy My Problem with Women for NBC.[54] On November 20, 2008, TV Guide reported that Timberlake’s next single, "Follow My Lead", which also featured vocals by Timberlake’s protégée, former YouTube star Esmée Denters, would be available for exclusive download through Myspace. All proceeds would go to Shriners Hospitals for Children, a charity dedicated to improving pediatric care for sick children.[55]

He also appeared at the 2010 MTV VMAs on September 12, 2010.[61] In 2011, he starred alongside Cameron Diaz in Bad Teacher and then alongside Mila Kunis in Friends with Benefits, and played Will Salas, the protagonist of In Time, a science fiction film by Andrew Niccol.[62] He provided a feature and appeared in the music video for the song Motherlover from The Lonely Island's second album Turtleneck & Chain,[63] and directed and made a cameo in the FreeSol music video "Hoodies On, Hats Low" which was released in August 2011.[64] In July 2011 United States Marine Kelsey De Santis uploaded a YouTube video asking Timberlake to be her date to the United States Marine Corps birthday ball; they attended the event on November 13, 2011 in Richmond, Virginia.[65][66]
Timberlake began work on his third studio album The 20/20 Experience in June 2012, with "no rules and/or end goal in mind".[67] He publicly announced his return to the music industry in January 2013,[68] releasing the album's lead single "Suit & Tie" featuring Jay-Z later that month, which would eventually peak at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. After four years not performing in concert, Timberlake appeared the night before the 2013 Super Bowl and performed during the "DirecTV Super Saturday Night", on February 2, 2013 in New Orleans.[69] On February 10, 2013, he performed "Suit & Tie" with sepia-toned lighting at the 55th Grammy Awards, with Jay-Z joining him from the audience. On February 11, 2013, "Mirrors" was released as the second single from The 20/20 Experience.[70] The song would eventually peak at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. The 20/20 Experience was released on March 19, 2013[71] through RCA Records due to the disbandment of Jive Records.[72][73] The album debuted at number one on the charts by moving just over 980,000 copies.[74] Timberlake also appeared on Jay-Z' twelfth studio album Magna Carta... Holy Grail on three songs including: "Holy Grail", "BBC" (along with Nas, Swizz Beatz, Timbaland, Pharrell Williams and Beyoncé Knowles) and "Heaven".[75] On August 25, 2013, Timberlake received the MTV Video Vanguard Award at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.[76] Timberlake's fourth studio album The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2 was released on September 30, 2013[77] and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.[78] Its lead single "Take Back the Night" was released on July 12, 2013.[79] The following single of The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2 was "TKO."[80] Timberlake was given a production and writing credit on track six on Beyoncé's self-titled fifth studio album, which was given a surprise iTunes release on December 13, 2013.[81] On February 25, 2014, "Not a Bad Thing" was released as the third single from The 20/20 Experience - 2 of 2.[82] In 2014, Timberlake appeared on Michael Jackson's second posthumous record Xscape on the song "Love Never Felt So Good", which was produced by Timbaland, Jerome "J-Roc" Harmon & Timberlake.[83] On May 14th 2014 a music video was also released featuring clips of Jackson and a number of Timberlake and a number of devoted fans performing some of Jackson's well known moves, the video was directed by Timberlake and Rich Lee.[84]
In early 1999, Timberlake began dating fellow former The New Mickey Mouse Club cast member and recording artist Britney Spears. Their relationship ended abruptly in March 2002. The breakup influenced the lyrics and theme of "Cry Me a River".[85] In April 2003, he began dating actress Cameron Diaz soon after they met at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards. After much speculation of breakups throughout their relationship,[86] the couple split in December 2006 shortly after she introduced him as musical guest on Saturday Night Live. In January 2007, they denied allegations of an alleged affair between Timberlake and Scarlett Johansson, with whom he had shot the music video for his song "What Goes Around... Comes Around".[87]
In January 2007, Timberlake began dating actress Jessica Biel, with whom he had been photographed on multiple occasions.[88] They became engaged in the mountains of Montana in December 2011.[89] The couple married on October 19, 2012 at the Borgo Egnazia resort in Fasano, Italy.[90]
He has said he has obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) mixed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).[91]

Timberlake has a lyric tenor vocal range.[92] During the production of FutureSex/LoveSounds, Timberlake was interested in rock music.[93] This inspiration was used in his approach in recording the songs, rather than in composing them. Timberlake reveals, "I wanted to sing the song like a rock and roll singer, not an R&B singer."[94] On the influences he drew from, he said that if Justified was "characterized" by Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder, FutureSex/LoveSounds is more like David Bowie and Prince.[95] Other influences include late INXS-frontman Michael Hutchence,[96] Arcade Fire, David Byrne, The Killers, The Strokes, and Radiohead.[93]
Unlike his previous record that was intended to focus on R&B and pop genres,[97] FutureSex/LoveSounds is less concentrated on one particular sound, thus representing a wider range. Timberlake explains, "It's more broad as far as the styles I wanted to mix in to my own type of thing."[98] A musically "complex" album, FutureSex/LoveSounds is a fusion of rap, rock, funk, soul, gospel, new wave, opera, and world music.[95] Entertainment Weekly noted that the album's sound is a "sonic departure" from both 'N Sync and Justified.[99] Although "What Goes Around" sounds similar to Justified, Timberlake admitted that it is the only song in the new album to have such similarity.[97]
Near the end of 2002, Timberlake was the first celebrity to appear on Punk'd, a "candid camera" type show created by Ashton Kutcher to trick celebrities.[100] Timberlake, who cried during the episode, later admitted to being under the influence of marijuana when he was pranked. Three episodes later, he set up Kelly Osbourne to be "punk'd", thus making him the first celebrity to appear on the show more than once.[101] Timberlake later spoofed Ashton Kutcher and Punk'd in a 2003 episode of NBC's Saturday Night Live.[102] Timberlake hosted many music events, including the European MTV Music Awards in 2006. On December 16, 2006, Timberlake hosted Saturday Night Live, doing double duty as both host and musical guest for the second time. During this appearance, he and Andy Samberg performed an R&B song for a skit titled "Dick in a Box", which some radio stations have aired as an unofficial single from Timberlake and has become one of the most viewed videos on YouTube. The song was later featured on The Lonely Island's debut album Incredibad. His fifth SNL episode, as host and musical guest, was the most-watched episode since January 7, 2012, with Charles Barkley as host and Kelly Clarkson as musical guest.[103] Timberlake is the executive producer on the MTV reality series The Phone, which premiered on April 21, 2009. Timberlake appeared on Jimmy Fallon's debut as host of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on March 2, 2009 as well as the fifth episode of Fallon's Tonight Show debut week on February 21, 2014.[104]
Timberlake has co-owned or provided celebrity endorsement for three restaurants in the United States: "Chi" opened in West Hollywood, California in 2003,[105] and "Destino" and "Southern Hospitalty" in New York opened in 2006 and 2007, respectively.[106] In 2005, Timberlake launched the William Rast clothing line with childhood friend Juan ("Trace") Ayala. The 2007 line contained cord jackets, cashmere sweaters, jeans, and polo shirts.[107] The pair reports inspiration from fellow Memphis native Elvis Presley: "Elvis is the perfect mixture of Justin and I," Ayala says. "You can go back and see pictures of him in cowboy boots and a cowboy hat and a nice button-down shirt, but then again you can see him in a tux and a collared shirt with rhinestones on it and slacks. We like to think 'If he was alive today, what would he be wearing?'"[108] Target has announced that a William Rast collection, including denim, outerwear and sportswear for men and women, would launch in December and be available for a month.[109] An avid amateur golfer, in 2007 Timberlake purchased the run-down Big Creek Golf Course in his home town of Millington, Tennessee, which he redeveloped as the eco-friendly Mirimichi Golf Course at a cost of some $US16 million. It was reopened on July 25, 2009 but closed again on January 15, 2010 for further improvements expected to take six months.[110] In October 2011, Timberlake received the Futures Award at the Environmental Media Awards for his green-conscious golf course.[111] Timberlake and his wife Jessica Biel are minority owners of the Memphis Grizzlies.[112]
Timberlake provides celebrity endorsement for many commercial products, this aspect of his business being managed by IMG since April 2008.[113] Major endorsements in 2009 included Sony electronic products,[114] Givenchy's men's fragrance "Play",[115] the Audi A1",[116] Callaway Golf Company products,[117][118] and in 2011, Myspace.[119][120] In 2012, he hosted Walmart's annual shareholders meeting[121] saying, "I buy a lot at Walmart."[122]
Timberlake has been active in several charitable pursuits, initially through 'N Sync's "Challenge for the Children" aimed at a range of charities, and since 2001 through his "Justin Timberlake Foundation," which initially funded music education programs in schools, but now has a much broader agenda.[123] In October 2005, the Grammy Association presented Timberlake with an award for his humanitarian efforts in Tennessee, alongside writer/director Craig Brewer, also a Memphis native.[124]
In November 2007, he donated A$100,000 from takings from his Australian tour to Wildlife Warriors founded by Steve Irwin.[125] On March 23, 2008, he donated $100,000 to the Memphis Rock N' Soul Museum and another $100,000 to the Memphis Music Foundation.[126]
On November 12, 2007, the PGA Tour announced that Timberlake, an avid golfer who plays to a 6 handicap,[127] would become the host of the tour's Las Vegas tournament starting in 2008. With Timberlake's agreement to host the tournament, its name was changed to the Justin Timberlake Shriners Hospitals for Children Open. He played in the celebrity pro-am on the day before the competitive tournament and hosted a charity concert during the week of the tournament.[128] The activity was a success, and was repeated in 2009. A review of the value of celebrities to fundraising concluded that Timberlake's contribution to Shriners Hospitals for Children was the single most valuable celebrity endorsement in the US during 2009, and worth over $US9 million.[129]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Justin Randall Timberlake was born to Lynn Harless and Randy Timberlake on January 31, 1981, in Memphis, Tennessee. At the age of 11, he appeared on the show Star Search (1983), and even though he didn't win, it didn't dampen his ambitions. He also appeared on MMC (1989), where his costars included Britney Spears, Ryan Gosling, Keri Russell, Christina Aguilera and future band-mate J.C. Chasez. At age 14, Justin became a member of the boy band *NSYNC. In 1998, the group released their self-titled debut album. They became a big hit with fans and made a place for themselves in the music world with a succession of big-selling albums. In the beginning of 2002, Justin spent time working on and writing songs for his debut solo album. During this time, he broke up with his longtime girlfriend, Britney Spears. The release of the solo album, titled "Justified", came in November of 2002. Songs from his solo album include: "Like I Love You", "Cry Me A River" and "Rock Your Body".Timberlake has branched out into an acting career, having most recently starred in The Social Network (2010), Friends with Benefits (2011), and Trouble with the Curve (2012).
      Co-wrote "Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays" with J.C. Chasez from *NSYNC's Christmas album, "Home For Christmas".
      A 15-year-old *NSYNC fan filed a lawsuit against Timberlake, claiming that he verbally assaulted her. Justin allegedly snubbed fans in a St. Louis hotel after which the plaintiff shouted that she thought J.C. Chasez was cuter. When she admitted to a guard that she was the one who made the comment, the guard made her go upstairs with Justin. After that, Timberlake allegedly pushed her against a wall and shouted insults at her. [November 2000]
      His mom thought of the name *NSYNC, using the last letter of each original member's first name: justiN, chriS (Chris Kirkpatrick), joeY (Joey Fatone), jasoN (Jason Watkins sang bass prior to Lance Bass joining the group) and j.C. (J.C. Chasez).
      He founded The Justin Timberlake Foundation through the Giving Back Fund. The foundation's goals are similar to the Save the Music Foundation.
      Cites his greatest fears as dying unloved, snakes, sharks, spiders and falling unconscious at a concert from the stuffed animals fans throw on stage.
      While touring in London, he met Coldplay lead singer and songwriter Chris Martin and struck up a close friendship. At the 2003 VMA awards he introduced the band's performance while calling them "the greatest band in the world.".
      His ex-girlfriend's (Britney Spears) ex-husband Kevin Federline was a former background dancer for *NSYNC at the 2002 Grammy Awards and in Justin's 2002 VMA performance.
      He and best friend Trace Ayala created a clothing line, "William Rast". Clothes became available for purchase from Kitson and Bloomingdales in November 2005. The name William Rast comes from Justin's grandfather, William Bomar, and Trace's grandfather, whose surname is Rast.
      Is set to star in West End play "Resurrection Blues" in London starting February 2006. Kevin Spacey is producing.
      He had a younger half-sister, Laura Katherine, who died minutes after birth. She was the first child of his father, Randy Timberlake, and stepmother Lisa. It is sometimes falsely reported that she was his twin. He mentions her sometimes in the liner notes of *NSYNC albums. Has two younger half-brothers, Jonathan Perry Timberlake (born September 12, 1993) and Stephen Robert Timberlake (born August 14, 1998). Both are sons of his father and stepmother.
      In his exclusive 20/20 (1978) interview, he told Barbara Walters that the "best burgers in the world" can be found at The General Store in Shelby Forest, Tennessee.
      Broke his thumb on stage in early 1997, when he slipped on a puddle of water that was a result of the audience being sprayed down due to extreme temperatures during the outdoor concert.

      [interview in Rolling Stone magazine about Britney Spears] I may not ever get over her. I really do still love that girl.
      England is the first country that I've had a #1 album in, so it is now officially my home away from home.
      [on the Super Bowl "wardrobe malfunction" incident] I am sorry if anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance.
      [in 2002, about fame] All you can do as an artist is do what you think is an extension of you. You put down on paper . . . who you are. That's what being an artist is all about. And when it gets done, you don't look back at it and say, "Oh, I could have done that better".
      [about girls] A lot of girls have cheated on me in the past, so it's hard for me to trust. But once I fall, I fall hard.
      [about music] I think music will always be a big part of my life. I can't go five minutes without singing, sometimes unconsciously. And people stare at me, and I'm wondering why they're staring, and then I'm realizing that I'm belting out a tune.
      [about the music industry] I can give you my personal opinion: Love the music, hate the business. It's a screwball business and there are a lot of players who will straight-up lie to you.
      [about love] True love, to me, is when she's the first thought that goes through your head when you wake up and the last thought that goes through your head before you go to sleep.
      [on who he would date] Pretty is cool, but it's not really about looks for me. It's more about personality. I like a girl with a good sense of humor, who's humble and sensitive.
      I don't feel guilty about success. You can't feel guilty about aspiring to be good at something.
      When I'm not on stage, I'm kind of shy. If you see me and I don't say much, don't think I'm not taking in what you have to say. I'm just not a big talker.
      [about *NSYNC] I don't regret anything that I've done with this group. I think that when people find something that they love to do they make sacrifices to do it.
      [on making Bad Teacher (2011)]: After the first week of rehearsal and the first orgy, it all came together.
      I think we created the only dry-humping scene in cinema history. There's nothing wrong with a good jean jam, but also the both of us felt collectively that we had a responsibility. It's really a public service announcement for safe sex.
      [on Friends with Benefits (2011)] The bedroom scenes were funny because we got to have conversations and banter while we were in the middle of the act. I think the audience can feel more comfortable because everyone has been in those situations, but no one talks about them. So seeing a couple who aren't a couple actually talking about [sex] as it is happening made for a lot of funny, situational humor.
      (2011, on *NSYNC's height of fame) Man, I could tell you a thousand stories. I remember girls running after the buses in the hundreds. We'd do an open-air festival in Germany and there'd be 60,000 people there. We'd finish playing, the band would be putting the gear up, and we would be trying to do a quick out, which is what they call it when you leave the stage before the band stops playing. We'd get on the bus and there would be 250 to 400 girls waiting to run after us. I distinctly remember Joey Fatone singing the theme song from The Goonies while this particular pack of girls was running. It was just crazy...I hate to disappoint you, but I was the youngest one in the group, so the other guys were getting more of that action, and they were protective of me. I think I was the one who cared about what we were doing onstage. My role was, we'd come offstage every night and get a DVD of the show, just like an athlete watching tape from a game. We'd get on the bus, and I'd go, "Okay, here's what we did right; here's what we did wrong," and we'd fix it for the next day. But yeah, the girl stuff definitely was a heavy part of it, and it would play with your mind. I remember looking down once-we were playing Madison Square Garden for an HBO special-and this girl put her arm out. She had a mural of me tattooed along her whole arm. I just remember looking at it and thinking, 'Holy shit, that's never going to come off'.
      (2011) Honestly, when you're making a movie, you never say, "Oh, this one's going to suck and go straight to video". When you're in it, you think you're doing the best work you can do. You're surrounded by people who are working hard. Everybody's hopeful. It's only a year later when you realize, "Wait, what was that exactly?" If anything shifted for me, though, it was the realization of how important it is to work with smart people. That takes a lot of the guesswork out. Just being in the room with David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin for my first reading for The Social Network (2010), I knew things would be different - even though I felt I had totally botched the audition. I botch a lot of auditions. But, the next thing I knew, I was on the set. It was surreal. This may sound strange, but I don't have aspirations to be a movie star. I make movies because I enjoy the creative process. Just to work with people like Fincher and ­Sorkin or to trade lines with great actors has been more surreal than anything I've accomplished in my music career.
      (2011) I feel like a rookie in the movie business, that's for sure. Maybe a little bit of an outsider, too, since I came to it from music. But I think that's fair. I don't know that I've done a huge body of work that would warrant my not feeling like that. Then again, this past year has certainly opened up a new chapter as far as acting, and I'm grateful for that.
      (2011, on his work ethic) I think people sometimes don't pay enough attention to what they do. I've done well, but the reason is pretty simple: I've worked my ass off. Anything I've done well has taken many, many hours of preparation. And then the trick, of course, is making that work look invisible. The toughest thing a performer can do is make it look as if it comes easy. You have to devote yourself 100 percent when you're figuring stuff out, whether it's with sports or music-or movies, which has been the main focus for me lately.
      (2011, on Friends with Benefits (2011)) I did go on a diet for that movie, which mostly came down to not drinking as much beer. And you know, beer is good, so that was hard. I'm pretty thin anyway, but I didn't want to look like a meathead. I was like, I'm about to be 30, and I'm going to be naked on camera. If I'm going to do this, I'm going to train pretty hard. In the end, I just did more cardio, and I pumped up the stuff I already do throughout the year, such as playing sports. I like basketball and golf and snowboarding, and I do them pretty fucking intensely.
      (2011, on what he would do if he got 100 percent anonymity for one day) Oh God, probably just go for a walk somewhere. I'd go walk around Paris or Rome. Or if I was really anonymous, maybe I'd do something outrageous like commit arson or rob someone or find all those fuckers who wait outside my house and go outside their houses and stalk them. A day of anonymity would be cool, though. Just to go to a store and not be hassled.
      (2011, on if he smokes marijuana) Absolutely...The only thing pot does for me is it gets me to stop thinking. Sometimes I have a brain that needs to be turned off. Some people are just better high.
      (2011) I grew up in a small town, and because I started working when I was 10, I was kind of looked at as more of an oddity. I would sing at the talent shows at schools and go around town doing different things, but it was more like, "That kid's a freak." You hear a lot of stories about child prodigies, child actors or ­people whose parents pushed them really hard. But I was the one begging for the stage. That made me kind of stand out in good ways and in weird ways. Not a lot of 10-year-old Caucasian kids were running around Millington, Tennessee, singing Stevie Wonder and Al Green songs, which were the songs I felt most connected to.
      (2011) The first half of my 20s I felt I had to achieve, achieve, achieve. I think a lot of men do this. I'm not saying just because I turned 30 I don't battle with this. I still battle with it. But in my 20s I had to do everything. I needed everybody to understand me and respect what I was doing. I remember putting out my second album [2006's FutureSex/LoveSounds]. When I put out the first song, "SexyBack," radio thought I was a joke. I couldn't let that go, so I started calling radio program directors. I'm pretty tenacious like that. I was like, "This is my record. Give it a chance." There wasn't any of my signature falsetto or anything. I'd say, "I know it doesn't sound like me, but just please give the record a two-week period or even a one-week period. Just let the music get out there. If the callback is good, keep playing it." I was that relentless. During the second half of my 20s I started to ask myself, What am I doing? What have I built, and how do I continue that for the next 10 years? For some reason, in the past year I've done so much work I feel as though it's backfired. I'm looking around now and I'm like, Where am I running? I've been running so hard for so long. I've seen the inside of more arenas than your average basketball player. Like I said, I've had that experience on tour sometimes when I think, I don't feel like going onstage. I have no energy right now. I'm sick, I barely have a voice. But you do it anyway. You feel obligated to go out because all those ­people showed up. You end up performing. But at some point in my life I wish I had learned to say no. From the beginning of my career, I was a guy who said yes all the time to everything.
      (2011, on the height of boy bands) It was a time: the concerts, the fans, the music. Plus, it wasn't just us (N'Sync). It was that whole factory we came out of-us, the Backstreet Boys and Britney-we were all together. It was bigger than any one of us and bigger than any of the groups. Everybody was selling a gazillion records at the same time. You couldn't keep what we were doing on the shelves. It was bigger than bubblegum. Sometimes I think back on the time we did five nights at Giants Stadium. That was the moment I just looked around and thought, 'There's nowhere for this to go but down. It's never going to get bigger than this'.
      (2011) Prince, who, to me, is the greatest musician who has ever lived. He keeps producing, keeps writing, keeps making unbelievable music-all because he's true to his passion...Everything he says, every note he sings, it's just like, man, that guy is so far ahead of the rest of us. One of my best experiences onstage was at his house during a party. Somebody came up to me and said, "Prince would love if you could sing something with the band." I said okay. I was kind of drunk, so I was like, "Let's do the Stones." Then we did "Miss You."
      (2011) I know the movies I love, and I'd like to make movies like them. Ferris Bueller's Day Off, E.T., The Goonies, Reds, The Music Man. Seeing Fight Club changed the way I watch movies. It was so much smarter than anything I'd ever seen before, which is why working with David Fincher was such a bucket-list move. Making movies that can touch people the way any of those films did would be all I could hope for.
      [on marriage] I think the mistake is that people commit to who that person is right then and not the person they're going to become. The art of staying together is changing together.
      [on appearing nude in Friends with Benefits (2011)] It was fun, but I can't say I'm going to be butt-naked in a movie again. I only did it because I'm young now and everything's where its' supposed to be. I figured this is the time, before gravity gets the best of me.
      Film is much more communal in both good and bad ways. Everyone talks about other people more, but then again no one in music gossips much because everyone's so incredibly narcissistic that they only want to talk about themselves.
      Jimmy Fallon just can't help himself. He's a brilliant comedian. A talented musician. A spot-on impersonator. Jimmy has redefined and recharged late-night television with a genuine excitement and energy that gets under your skin. That's probably because watching you laugh might be the thing that makes Jimmy most happy. His lightning wit - mixed with a kindness you don't normally find in comedy - is what makes you feel so comfortable having him him in your home every night. And, no matter where the joke goes, the audience feels like they are in on it too. That's because Jimmy likes to share the moment. He can't help himself. And neither can we.
      [on the backlash surrounding his and Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction incident] I probably got ten percent of the blame. I think America's probably harsher on women, and I think America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people.

=======================================================
From The Mickey Mouse Club and NSYNC, to all singing and dancing soloist, Justin has created a significant career for himself. How did he get his 'sexy back' to become a dynamic mega star?
Justin Randall Timberlake, who is sometimes called JT, was born to Lynn Harless and Randall Timberlake in Memphis Tennessee on January 31st 1981.
He was born with music in his blood, as his father was the choir director for a local Baptist church, and his grandfather, Charles L. Timberlake, was a Baptist minister.
Justin spent his childhood in Millington, a small town just north of Memphis. His parents divorced when he was five years of age, and both his parents have since remarried. His mother, Lyn is now married to Paul Harless, a banker, and his father got married again to a lady called Lisa.
Justin now has two half-brothers, both from his father’s second marriage - Jonathan (born in 1993) and Stephen (born in 1998). Justin also has a half-sister Laura, who died shortly after being born in 1997, and she is often mentioned on Justin’s album credits as “My Angel in Heaven”.
Justin has always been very close to his mother: “”We have a very special relationship”, he says, “She’s been my best friend since I figured out what I wanted to be. With girls, you keep searching for someone that’s as good as your mum, and that’s a losing battle.” Justin’s mother now runs an entertainment company called JustinTime Entertainment.
Justin showed himself to be a natural performer from a very early age, and by the time he was 10, he was already singing on the stage of the world-famous Grand Ole Opry. The famous Timberlake singing and dancing style are greatly influenced by Michael Jackson, and Justin is often called the new King of Pop.
Justin’s first official paid “gig” came in 1993, when he was still only 12, when he sang on stage with the Disney Mickey Mouse Club. Justin’s debut on the Disney stage proved to be a major turning-point in both his professional and personal life, for it was whilst singing here that he met Britney Spears, his future girlfriend; Christina Aguilera, his future touring mate; and also JC Chasez, his future bandmate in NSYNC.
When his Mickey Mouse Club appearances came to an end in 1995, Justin asked JC Chasez if he would like to take part in a new all-boy singing band that his buddy Lou Pearlman was putting together with musician Chris Kirkpatrick.
Joey Fatone and Lance Bass were the other members of the band, which soon came to be known as ‘ NSYNC. Funnily enough, it was Justin’s mother who came up with the band’s name by using the last letter in each boy’s name to form the words ‘NSYNC.
With former New Kids On The Block manager Johnny Wright on board as their manager, the emerging boy band sought the help and expertise of seasoned music producers Kristian Lundin (Backstreet Boys) and Denniz Pop and Max Martin (Roby, Ace of Base), and rapidly turned out a swift succession of pop-oriented singles aimed at the teenage market.
NSYNC released their first single in 1996, and hit the big time in their home market two years later, spreading their music via a tour of American roller rinks. Once they got going, it seemed as though NSYNC were virtually unstoppable, and in the year 2000, they released the fast-selling album of all time, called No Strings Attached.
In 2002, however, the demands of fame began to take their toll. After completing the tour to promote their new album, Celebrity, and the release of Girlfriend, the third hit single from the album, the group decided to take a break from their exhausting schedule.
Justin wanted to keep right on performing, however, and it was at this point that he began to think about pursuing a solo career. He promptly began work on his first solo album, and was keen to take the opportunity to re-vamp his clean-cut image.
Going solo gave Justin the chance to break away from his old boy-band look, and he sought to develop a more mature - and also more openly sexy - style, both in the way he dressed and the way he sang…
After many long, hard months working on his new album, which was eventually called Justified, Justin performed at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, where he launched his first solo single, “Like I Love You”, a catchy dance number produced by the Neptunes.
Justin’s new musical style was radically different to the kind of numbers he had performed in his NSYNC days, featuring a heavy R&B influence thanks to the hip-hop inclinations of his new producers, the Neptunes.
Following the release of the single, Justin released his first solo album on 5th November the same year. It entered the Billboard 200 Chart at Number 2, and sold nearly half a million copies in the first week alone!
In keeping with his musical background, the album featured several tracks that were originally intended to be released on Michael Jackson’s Invincible album, but never quite made it to the final selection.
Several further singles from the album were released throughout late 2002 and 2003, including the hit singles “Rock Your Body” and “Cry Me A River”. Justin promoted the album by heading up the Justified/ Stripped Tour with his old stage buddy from Disney Mickey Mouse Club days, Christina Aguilera throughout the summer of 2003.
The Black Eyed Peas frequently opened the tour dates. Incidentally, Justin has often sung with the Black Eyed Peas on stage, but usually goes unaccredited on their albums.
At the end of 2003, Justin recorded a song called “I’m Lovin’It”, which was subsequently adopted by fast-food chain McDonald as the theme song for their “I’m Lovin’ It” campaign.
Like many gifted young singers, Justin’s solo career has not been without its share of controversy. In February 2004, during the half-time show of the Superbowl XXXVIII, Justin performed with Janet Jackson, and tore off part of her black leather costume in order to illustrate the lyrics “gonna have you naked by the end of this song”. But the stunt accidentally went a bit too far, and part of Jackson’s breast was briefly exposed. Justin apologised profusely for the incident, saying “I’m sorry if anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction…it was not intentional and regrettable.”
Thanks to Justin and Janet, The phrase “wardrobe malfunction” has now entered pop mythology and has become a stock phrase ever since. But as a result, Justin and Janet Jackson were banned from the 2004 Grammy Awards unless they consented to apologise once again on live TV before the whole nation.
Janet Jackson refused to do so. But Justin attended the event, and read out a pre-written apology. He received 2 Grammy Awards that night, Best Pop Vocal Album for Justified, and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for “Cry Me A River”.
Following the Superbowl scandal, Justin took a break from his singing career, and decided to try his hand at acting. He’d already enjoyed a few cameo roles during his early singing career. These included playing the part of a male model in Model Behaviour in 2000, and another bit part in On The Line in 2001. So he was keen to develop his acting skills. He played a journalist in the thriller Edison Force (2004) and also appeared in Alpha Dog, Southland Tales and Black Snake Moan. He is the voice of the young King Arthur in Shrek the Third (2007) and even appeared as a young Elton John in John’s promo video for the song, “This Train Don’t Stop There Anymore”.
In late 2002, Justin was the first celebrity to appear on “Punk’d”, a candid camera-style show devised by Demi Moore’ s husband Ashton Kutcher, in order to trick celebrities into making fools of themselves on TV! Three episodes later, Justin set up Kelly Osborne to be “punk’d”, and thus became the first celebrity to appear on the show more than once. In addition, Justin got his own back on Ashton Kutcher when he subsequently spoofed both Kutcher and “Punk’d” in an episode of NBC’s Saturday Night Live!
Justin also appeared on Saturday Night Live in December 2006, when he turned up for double duties on the show, acting both as host and musical artist once again. During the show, Justin and his colleague Andy Samberg performed an R&B song for a famous skit called “Dick In A Box”, which some radio stations in America have aired as an unofficial Timberlake single.
As well as acting and appearing on TV, Justin found time to launch his own clothing line , called William Rast, which went on sale at Bloomingdales in 2005. He also carried on singing with other artists. He sang with the Black Eyed Peas in My Style on their 2005 album, Monkey Business, and was also featured on Nelly Furtado’s song, Work It.
In the summer of 2005, Justin also launched his own record company, JayTee Records. He continued to work on his second solo album, and released FutureSex/ LoveSounds in September 2006. The album went straight to Number 1 in the Billboard chart, and sold 904,000 copies in the first week alone! The album also received the biggest number of pre-orders ever recorded on iTunes.
Justin peformed the album’s lead single, “Sexy Back” at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards. The second and third singles subsequently released from the album, My Love, and “What Goes Around…Comes Around” also achieved massive sales, with My Love also going straight to Number 1 in the Billboard Hot 100.
Despite his forays into movie acting and TV, Justin still felt that the music industry was the proper home for his talents. In October 2006, he confirmed that he was still totally committed to music, and was going to put his music career first from now on.
Despite his phenomenal professional success, Justin’s private life has not been without its own share of scandal and heartbreak. As a teenager, he first dated his high school sweetheart, and then went out with wannabe pop singer Veronica Finn. But his most famous romance was with fellow superstar pop singer Britney Spears, whom he’d first met back in 1993, on the stage of the Mickey Mouse Club.
Justin and Britney were engaged to be married, with Britney famously declaring her intention to remain a virgin until her wedding night, in interview after interview in the world’s tabloid press! But the ill-starred love affair came to a sudden end in 2002, allegedly because Britney cheated on Justin with choreographer Wade Robson, who was a mutual friend of the couple.
Justin was devastated by the break-up, and apparently, so was his mother. Mother Lyn still speaks kindly of Britney: “She grew up on my living-room floor. I still love her to death. They were together ten or eleven years and had, from day one, instant chemistry between them. She’s a sweet girl. I just hate what she’s going through now.”
But every cloud is said to have a silver living, and Justin’s troubled love life is said to have provided the inspiration for his smash hit, “Cry me A River”, one of the best-selling singles from Justin’s album, Justified.
Since splitting up with Britney Spears, Justin has dated a string of high-profile ladies, but none of his romances appear to have stayed the course. The first girl he dated after Britney was actress/ dancer Jenna Dewan, whom he was seeing in 2002; then came actress/singer Alyssa Milano, whom he dated briefly in autumn 2002.
Justin’s name was then linked with that of top Hollywood actress Cameron Diaz, some years his senior. Justin and Cameron got together after meeting at the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards in April 2003, but their relationship was stormy, and there were frequent rumours of rows and break-ups in the gossip columns and the tabloid press. Finally, in December 2006, the couple did actually split up - and issued the following joint statement…
“It has always been our preference not to comment on the status of our relationship, but out of respect for the time we’ve spent together, we are compelled to do so now, in light of recent speculation and the number of inaccurate stories that are reported by the media. We have, in fact, ended our romantic relationship and have done so mutually and as friends, with continued love and respect for each other.”He was rumoured to be dating another top Hollywood actress, Scarlet Johansson, who appeared in his music video for the single, ‘What Goes Around…Comes Around’, which reportedly led to the split. Later in January 2007, Timberlake was linked to actress Jessica Biel when pictures of the two together were published by the news media.
A fan of English Premier League football club Manchester United, the award-winning star's sex appeal was recognised in 2009 when both Teen People and Cosmopolitan magazine handed him ‘Sexiest Man Alive’ recognitions. He continues to produce movies while music takes a bit of a back seat, but he has vowed to produce another record some day.
Justin is also a generous person, as highlighted by his links to several charities, which he has donated money to. In 2007, some of the earnings from his Australian tour were donated to Wildlife Warriors, which was founded by the late Steve Irwin. This was followed by a similar contribution to the Memphis Rock 'n' Soul Museum and to the Memphis Music Foundation in 2008.
He is also a supporter of Shriners Hospitals for Children, a charity dedicated to improving paediatric care for sick children. His backing of the organisation coupled with his love of golf resulted in the Justin Timberlake Shriners Hospitals for Children Open. The event has raised millions of dollars for the charity since the PGA Tour Las Vegas tournament was changed to carry his name.
Timberlake has continued to forge a successful acting career in recent years. In 2009, he starred in 'The Open Road' alongside Kate Mara and Jeff Bridges.
The following year, he appeared in the hugely successful movie 'The Social Network', which was directed by David Fincher and is based on the founding of Facebook. The film received favourable reviews from critics, with Peter Travers of Rolling Stone hailing it as the "movie of the year". Despite his success on the big screen, Timberlake is still making music. In 2009, he co-wrote and lent his vocals to the song 'Carry Out', which featured on Timbaland's 'Shock Value II' album. The star is also set to feature on rapper Sebastian's forthcoming album 'Cruel Intentions'.In March 2011, it was announced that Timberlake had split from his partner of four years, actress Jessica Biel. A statement released on behalf of the couple said the pair had "mutually decided to part ways". It added: "The two remain friends and continue to hold the highest level of love and respect for each other."
=======================================================
Justin Timberlake may be the quintessential pop star of the new millennium, a star who jumped from platform to platform on his way to establishing himself as something bigger than a star: he was a self-sustained empire. Timberlake began his rise as a TV star, performing on The New Mickey Mouse Club as a child in the '90s, but he earned his superstardom as one of the frontmen for *NSYNC, the most popular boy band of the turn of the millennium. Justin stepped away from the band just as its popularity crested, releasing the sleek Justified in 2002, its hit singles "Cry Me a River" and "Rock Your Body" establishing him as a force outside the group, and he consolidated that success in 2006 with FutureSex/LoveSounds, the album that generated his biggest hit, "SexyBack." After reaching this pop peak, he decided to pursue other ventures, choosing to concentrate on acting and entrepreneurship. Recurring appearances on Saturday Night Live proved to be among the show's most popular spots and he received acclaim for his performance in the 2010 Oscar-winning film The Social Network. Additionally, Timberlake established his own fashion imprint and record label, opened several restaurants, and, in 2011, invested in MySpace.
Timberlake's journey to stardom began in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was born on January 31, 1981. He began performing early, appearing on the televised talent competition Star Search at the age of 11, singing under the name of Justin Randall. This was his first step into the big leagues, leading to him securing a spot on The New Mickey Mouse Club in 1993. This cast would prove to be filled with future stars; in addition to Timberlake there were the pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, actor Ryan Gosling, and JC Chasez, who'd later join Justin in *NSYNC, the group manager Lou Pearlman assembled in the late '90s. Pearlman formed *NSYNC after the cancellation of The New Mickey Mouse Club in 1994, taking Timberlake and Chasez as his anchors and adding Joey Fatone, Lance Bass, and Chris Kirkpatrick.
*NSYNC began their march toward stardom in 1996 when their first album appeared in Europe. Two years later, their eponymous debut was released in the U.S. and the group scored hits with "Tearin' Up My Heart," "I Want You Back," and "(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You." The latter reached the Top Ten, paving the way for the smash success of No Strings Attached in 2000. Upon its release in March 2000, the album sold an astonishing 2.4 million copies in its first week, setting a record that is unlikely to ever be broken. After generating the singles "It's Gonna Be Me" and "Bye Bye Bye," the group set to work on its next album, 2001's Celebrity. It was another massive hit, launching the Top Ten singles "Pop," "Gone," and "Girlfriend, but it proved to be the group's last album, as Timberlake's popularity was quickly eclipsing that of the rest of the group.
It didn't take long for Justin to release his first solo album. Justified appeared a little over a year after Celebrity and its gleaming, stylish surfaces -- partially produced by the Neptunes and partially produced by Timbaland -- suggested a new, mature, adventurous musician who was as much an R&B vocalist as he was a pop singer. Timberlake supported the album with a co-headlining tour with Christina Aguilera in 2003 and he ruled the airwaves with the singles "Like I Love You," "Cry Me a River," Señorita," and "Rock Your Body," not to mention the "I'm Lovin' It" jingle for McDonalds. He weathered a scandal in early 2004, when he tore off part of Janet Jackson's costume during their half-time duet at Super Bowl XXXVIII, but he bounced back nicely, winning Grammys that year for Justified and "Cry Me a River." He also launched William Rast, a clothing line.
As he worked on his second album with producer Timbaland, Timberlake found time to resume his acting career, taking on key roles in Southland Tales, Black Snake Moan, and Alpha Dog. Before any of these films appeared his second album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, was released, preceded by the single "SexyBack," a cool synthesized groove in the vein of Prince that established the tone for the album. "SexyBack" stayed at number one for seven weeks and its two sequels, "My Love" and "What Goes Around.../...Comes Around Interlude," also reached number one over the following year, a year that also saw Justin launch an international tour in support of the album.
Following the completion of the FutureSex/LoveSounds tour, Timberlake slowly stepped away from music. He sang with Madonna on her 2007 single "4 Minutes" and appeared on 50 Cent's "Ayo Technology" that same year, and he had other musical endeavors over the next few years, but his main focus was acting. Beginning in 2006, he frequently performed on Saturday Night Live, in 2007 he had a voice role in Shrek 3, and in 2008 he had a lead part in Mike Myers' The Love Guru. Two years later, Timberlake had his greatest acting success as Sean Parker in David Fincher's The Social Network; he quickly followed this with roles in Bad Teacher and Friends with Benefits. In January 2013, after investing in three Los Angeles and New York restaurants, he released a new single, "Suit & Tie," co-produced with Timbaland. Along with a glitzy performance at the 2013 Grammy Awards and another SNL appearance, it set the stage for The 20/20 Experience, released that March. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and eventually went double platinum, driven by Top Five showings for its singles, "Suit & Tie" and "Mirrors." Two months later, the Coen Brothers film Inside Llewyn Davis, in which he co-starred, premiered at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and won the Grand Prix. Part two of The 20/20 Experience, recorded during the same session that resulted in the first, was released that September. It followed the first to the top of the charts, and produced three Top 40 singles, "Take Back the Night," "TKO," and "Not a Bad Thing." ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi
