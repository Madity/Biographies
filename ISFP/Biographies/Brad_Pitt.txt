 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          An actor and producer known as much for his versatility as he is for his handsome face, Golden Globe-winning actor Brad Pitt's most widely recognized role may be Tyler Durden in Fight Club (1999). But his portrayals of Billy Beane in Moneyball (2011), and Rusty Ryan in the remake of Ocean's Eleven (2001) and its sequels, also loom large in his filmography.Pitt was born William Bradley Pitt on December 18th, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and raised in Springfield, Missouri. He majored in journalism at University of Missouri, but left college two credits shy of graduating to move to California.Pitt's earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera Another World (1964) before appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary prime time soap opera Dallas (1978). Following a string of guest appearances on various television series through the 1980s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in Thelma & Louise (1991), in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned Geena Davis. This lead to starring roles in badly received films such as Johnny Suede (1991) and Cool World (1992).But Pitt's career hit an upswing with his casting in A River Runs Through It (1992), which cemented his status as an multi-layered actor as opposed to just a pretty face. Pitt's subsequent projects were as quirky and varied in tone as his performances, ranging from his unforgettably comic cameo as stoner roommate Floyd in True Romance (1993) to romantic roles in such visually lavish films as Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994) and Legends of the Fall (1994), to an emotionally tortured detective in the horror-thriller Se7en (1995). His portrayal of frenetic oddball Jeffrey Goines in Twelve Monkeys (1995) won him a Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role.Pitt's portrayal of Achilles in the big-budget period drama Troy (2004) helped establish his appeal as action star and was closely followed by a co-starring role in the stylish spy-versus-spy flick Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005). It was on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith that Pitt, who married Jennifer Aniston in a highly publicized ceremony in 2000, met his current partner Angelina Jolie. Pitt left Aniston for Jolie in 2005, a break-up that continues to fuel tabloid stories years after its occurrence.He continues to wildly vary his film choices, appearing in everything from high-concept popcorn flicks such as Megamind (2010) to adventurous critic-bait like Inglourious Basterds (2009) and The Tree of Life (2011). He has received two Best Actor Oscar nominations, for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) and Moneyball (2011).Pitt and Jolie have six children, including two sons and a daughter who were adopted.

      I'm gonna design my own fleet of trailers. No! I'm gonna record an album like Jennifer Lopez. It'll be an acoustic version of KC & The Sunshine Band. Then maybe I'll design a line of clothes like [Sean Combs] but all in synthetic fur.
      I'd like to design something like a city or a museum. I want to do something hands on rather than just play golf which is the sport of the religious right.
      [on what keeps him humble] You know, I telephoned my grandparents the other day, and my grandfather said to me, "We saw your movie." "Which one?" I said, and he shouted, "Betty, what was the name of that movie I didn't like?" I thought that was just classic. I mean, if that doesn't keep your feet on the ground, what would?
      Success is a beast. And it actually puts the emphasis on the wrong thing. You get away with more instead of looking within.
      [Time magazine, 10/13/97] You shouldn't speak until you know what you're talking about. That's why I get uncomfortable with interviews. Reporters ask me what I feel China should do about Tibet. Who cares what I think China should do? I'm a f---ing actor! They hand me a script. I act. I'm here for entertainment. Basically, when you whittle everything away, I'm a grown man who puts on makeup.
      When you see a person, do you just concentrate on their looks? It's just a first impression. Then there's someone who doesn't catch your eye immediately, but you talk to them and they become the most beautiful thing in the world. The greatest actors aren't what you would call beautiful sex symbols. I'll tell you who my favorite actress is, Dianne Wiest, and you wouldn't call her a sex symbol. Dianne Wiest is, to me, the most beautiful woman on the screen.
      [when asked by Conan O'Brien how he got into character as stoner Floyd in True Romance (1993)] I'm a method actor.
      [in May, 2005, on his impending divorce to Jennifer Aniston] The thing I don't understand is looking at this as a failure. It's talked about like it failed, I guess because it wasn't flawless. Me, I embrace the messiness of life. I find it so beautiful, actually.
      [2003] It's amazing what an impending midlife crisis will do for you, really. It got me motivated, having turned 40 in December.
      [on having children] It really changes your perspective on the world. You know, I've had my day. I made some films, and I've really had a very fortunate life, and it's time for me to share that a little bit. Having children takes the focus off yourself, which I'm really grateful for. I'm so tired of thinking about myself. I'm sick of myself. You feel you want to be there and not miss out on anything. It's a true joy and a very profound love. You can write a book, you can make a movie, you can paint a painting, but having kids is the most extraordinary thing I've ever taken on.
      [on how his children will influence his future roles] My thoughts these days are, "Oh, my God, what did I do? What are they going to see from the past?" It definitely colors what I'll approach in the future. I'll try to be a little bit more mature about my decisions.
      [on how his earlier, lesser film roles ultimately improved him as an actor]: I believe I'm quite capable and we, as people, can learn to do anything, and that's proof of it! And my education is on film, on record! Now I can take on anything that comes my way and find truth in it an do a pretty good job.
      [2010 - on New Orleans] Truthfully, my favorite sound in the entire world is opening up the balcony doors in the French Quarter and hearing four different sounds playing at once from the apartments across the way or down the street. It's a balmy night, twilight, and I'm drinking a beer, and this feeling just falls over me, of contentment. It gives me goosebumps to talk about it.
      [on being dumped by ex-fiancée Jill Schoelen in 1989] She called me up in Los Angeles and was crying on the phone. She was lonely and there was a huge drama. At this point I had $800 to my name and I spent $600 of it getting a ticket from Los Angeles to Hungary to see her. I got there, went straight to the set where she was filming and that night we went out to dinner. She told me that she had fallen in love with the director of the film. I was so shocked I said, 'I'm outta here.' I spent my night in Budapest, sitting on a bench, smoking, with just a local bum to talk to who couldn't speak English. These are the days and nights you remember when you have success. I returned to America absolutely broke. This is why recognition does not bother me too much.
      [2009] What's valuable to me has become clearer as I've got older. To me, it's about the value of your time and your day and the value of the people you spend it with. It's about me being a strong father and guide and a good match for my significant other. Then, if I'm going to go to work, it must be something of value to me. I'm much more experienced now, so I can find films that are interesting quicker and cut out the films that don't really matter. It means more to me now because my kids are going to see them, and I want them to be proud.
      [1998, on why he moved to L.A.] A lot of the attraction before I came out was the fame, the lifestyle...now my motivation is more, 'I want to be good!'.
      We make breakfast like everyone else and it's chaos and pancake batter splashed all over the place and bath time at night. Ultimately, I'm dad. I have the concerns a dad has. Is everyone safe? Am I spending enough time with them? These are the things that keep me awake.
      [on comparing his own parenting style with that of his character in 'The Tree of Life']: They say actions speak louder than words. It's even more true with my kids. And so it's quite important to me not to put my frustrations on them or bring them in the door. I want to keep them to be free and not encumbered with my junk. In the film it's the exact opposite. I find it very sad, a very sad man who was embittered by his situation, doesn't feel he can get ahead, always feels like he's on the losing end, feels quite oppressed by his surroundings and predicament, doesn't know why it isn't working out for him and why is it working out for other people. That poisoned view of things.
      [2011] I spent the '90s trying to hide out, trying to duck the full celebrity cacophony. I started to get sick of myself sitting on a couch, holding a joint, hiding out. It started feeling pathetic. It became very clear to me that I was intent on trying to find a movie about an interesting life, but I wasn't living an interesting life myself. I think that my marriage [to Jennifer Aniston] had something to do with it. Trying to pretend the marriage was something that it wasn't.
      [2011, on Angelina Jolie] One of the greatest, smartest things I ever did was give my kids Angie as their mom. She is such a great mom. Oh, man, I'm so happy to have her.
      [2011, on learning to be a parent] I was surprised at how automatic it is, how much of it is instinctual. And now I have a great confidence and trust in those instincts. I mean, one sound at night and you're awake and up because they may need you. Or when they start to have a tantrum, you know to divert them from spinning out by helping them focus on something. It just goes on and on. I tell them, 'You can make a mess, but you've got to clean it up.'
      [2011, on his religious upbringing] I had my problems with it. It doesn't work for me. I had a lot of questions. But to get to that point where I actually questioned something that I'd based my life on - it wasn't until I was 20 that I really started separating from it, knowing that the ideas didn't make sense. I remember this scary moment where I didn't have anything to pin my existence on, to be comforted by. At the same time, it didn't work for me, man. I had to go up against this thing. I've since ... My family accepts me for who I am and they worry for me because I'm gonna burn in an eternal pit of fire. But ...
      [on the stress of filming Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994)] One day, it broke me... I called David Geffen, who was a producer... I said, 'David, I can't do this anymore. I can't do it. How much will it take to get me out?' And he goes, very calmly, 'Forty million dollars.'
      [on playing the leading character in The Tree of Life (2011)] That's certainly not my father. But I do understand the father-knows-best mentality, the oppression the father figure can have on his kids, the pressure he is under to be the leader and provide, and feeling like he's falling short and having wants and desires himself. The tragedy is coming home and bringing that on the kids, and then feeling bad about it. It's just this vicious cycle.
      [on the Academy Awards nomination process] I've been around long enough to know it's very fickle and it's a cyclical wheel. But I will say this: it's surprisingly fun when your number comes up.
      [2012: while accepting the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for Moneyball and The Tree of Life] "This is a really big honor for me, considering I'm a guy who had never ridden in an airplane until I was 25. That first trip was here in 1989 to New York. I had an audition for a soap opera. But I had to put myself up, and I stayed at a friend's apartment. That apartment was in the Village on Christopher Street. My first impression of the city was: my god, there's a lot of guys around here. But they're so _nice_....This is a real pleasure for me to see some of the faces behind the formidable names that instill such fear and reverence in the film industry, although I thought you'd be taller....We are complex, we are mysteries to ourselves, we are difficult to each other, we live in continual flux and instability and conflict. Christians and Muslims, Democrats and Republicans, Denby and Rudin."
      I grew up very religious, and I don't have a great relationship with religion. I oscillate between agnosticism and atheism.
      [on whether he would consider becoming a director: 2012] No, not a chance. It makes sense on some level, but I really enjoy being a creative producer and I enjoy my day job as an actor. It's enough for me. I want to also be a dad, first and foremost. After two days it gets itchy. I miss them. I just know how I'd be. I see how much time it takes to mount the thing and put it together. It wouldn't be a good match.
      I think I'm at a point now where I feel like I can jump into anything and lay something down that's quality. Someone may be better at it - or maybe not - but I know that if I have a feeling for it, then I can make it interesting. But even more as I get older, it's about the company that I keep. That's the most important thing to me - that if I'm gonna spend however long it takes to make a movie, give up 14 hours a day for however many weeks or months, then it's very important for me to know that I'm working with people who I respect and enjoy and that we're going for something together.
      [ on 'World War Z'] We liked this idea of taking a genre and using that as, I guess, a metaphor for pandemics, and if one of those pandemics jumped the tracks. Would we be ready? What countries would be in better shape, what countries would take the biggest hit?...A movie is only good if it speaks about our time, if it's personal in some way, and it plugs into the zeitgeist to irritate a little bit. I think we got that here.

William Bradley Pitt was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma to Jane Etta (née Hillhouse), a school counsellor, and William Alvin Pitt, who ran a trucking company.[4][5] The family soon moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he lived together with his younger siblings, Doug (born 1966) and Julie Neal (born 1969).[6] Born into a conservative household,[7] he was raised as Southern Baptist,[8] but has since stated that he does not "have a great relationship with religion" and that he "oscillate[s] between agnosticism and atheism."[9][10] Pitt has described Springfield as "Mark Twain country, Jesse James country", having grown up with "a lot of hills, a lot of lakes".[11]
Pitt attended Kickapoo High School, where he was a member of the golf, swimming and tennis teams.[12][13] He participated in the school's Key and Forensics clubs, in school debates, and in musicals.[14] Following his graduation from high school, Pitt enrolled in the University of Missouri in 1982, majoring in journalism with a focus on advertising.[14] As graduation approached, Pitt did not feel ready to settle down. He loved films—"a portal into different worlds for me"—and, since films were not made in Missouri, he decided to go to where they were made.[8] Two weeks before earning his degree, Pitt left the university and moved to Los Angeles, where he took acting lessons and worked odd jobs.[8]
While struggling to establish himself in Los Angeles, Pitt took lessons from acting coach Roy London.[14][15] Pitt's acting career began in 1987, with uncredited parts in the films No Way Out, No Man's Land and Less Than Zero.[14][16] His television debut came in May 1987 with a two-episode role on the NBC soap opera Another World.[17] In November of the same year Pitt had a guest appearance on the ABC sitcom Growing Pains.[18] He appeared in four episodes of the CBS primetime series Dallas between December 1987 and February 1988 as Randy, the boyfriend of Charlie Wade (played by Shalane McCall).[19] Later in 1988, Pitt made a guest appearance on the Fox police drama 21 Jump Street.[20]
In the same year, the Yugoslavian–U.S. co-production The Dark Side of the Sun (1988) gave Pitt his first leading film role, as a young American taken by his family to the Adriatic to find a remedy for a skin condition. The film was shelved at the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence, and was not released until 1997.[14] Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy Happy Together; the second a featured role in the horror film Cutting Class, the first of Pitt's films to reach theaters.[18] He made guest appearances on television series Head of the Class, Freddy's Nightmares, Thirtysomething, and (for a second time) Growing Pains.[21]
Pitt was cast as Billy Canton, a drug addict who takes advantage of a young runaway (played by Juliette Lewis) in the 1990 NBC television movie Too Young to Die?, the story of an abused teenager sentenced to death for a murder.[22] Ken Tucker, television reviewer for Entertainment Weekly wrote: "Pitt is a magnificent slimeball as her hoody boyfriend; looking and sounding like a malevolent John Cougar Mellencamp, he's really scary."[22] The same year, Pitt co-starred in six episodes of the short-lived Fox drama Glory Days and took a supporting role in the HBO television movie The Image.[23] His next appearance came in the 1991 film Across the Tracks; Pitt portrayed Joe Maloney, a high school runner with a criminal brother, played by Ricky Schroder.[24]
After years of supporting roles in movies and frequent television guest appearances, Pitt attracted wider recognition in his supporting role in the 1991 road film Thelma & Louise.[23] He played J.D., a small-time criminal who befriends Thelma (Geena Davis). His love scene with Davis has been cited as the event that defined Pitt as a sex symbol.[18][25] After Thelma & Louise, Pitt starred in the 1991 film Johnny Suede, a low-budget picture about an aspiring rock star,[26] and the 1992 film Cool World,[18] although neither furthered his career, having poor reviews and box office performance.[27][28]
Pitt took the role of Paul Maclean in the 1992 biographical film A River Runs Through It, directed by Robert Redford.[29] His portrayal of the character was described by People's Janet Mock as a career-making performance,[30] proving that Pitt could be more than a "cowboy-hatted hunk."[31] He has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film[6] and thought it one of his "weakest performances ... It's so weird that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for."[6] Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew. He compared working with Redford to playing tennis with a superior player, saying "when you play with somebody better than you, your game gets better."[30][31]
In 1993, Pitt reunited with Juliette Lewis for the road film Kalifornia. He played Early Grayce, a serial killer and the boyfriend of Lewis's character in a performance described by Peter Travers of Rolling Stone as "outstanding, all boyish charm and then a snort that exudes pure menace."[32] Pitt also garnered attention for a brief appearance in the cult hit True Romance as a stoner named Floyd, providing much needed comic relief to the action film.[33] He capped the year by winning a ShoWest Award for Male Star of Tomorrow.[34]
1994 marked a significant turning point in Pitt's career. Starring as the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac in the feature film Interview with the Vampire, based on Anne Rice's 1976 novel of the same name,[35] he was part of an ensemble cast that included Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Christian Slater, and Antonio Banderas.[35] Despite his winning two MTV Movie Awards at the 1995 ceremony,[36] his performance was poorly received. According to the Dallas Observer, "Brad Pitt ... is a large part of the problem [in the film]. When directors play up his cocky, hunkish, folksy side ... he's a joy to watch. But there's nothing about him that suggests inner torment or even self-awareness, which makes him a boring Louis."[37]
Following the release of Interview with the Vampire, Pitt starred in Legends of the Fall (1994),[38] based on a novel by the same name by Jim Harrison, set in the American West during the first four decades of the twentieth century. Portraying Tristan Ludlow, son of Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) a Cornish immigrant,[39] Pitt received his first Golden Globe Award nomination, in the Best Actor category.[40] Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas co-starred as Pitt's brothers. Although the film's reception was mixed,[41] many film critics praised Pitt's performance. Janet Maslin of The New York Times said, "Pitt's diffident mix of acting and attitude works to such heartthrob perfection it's a shame the film's superficiality gets in his way."[42] The Deseret News predicted that Legends of the Fall would solidify Pitt's reputation as a lead actor.[43]
In 1995, Pitt starred alongside Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow in the crime thriller Seven, playing a detective on the trail of a serial killer.[44] Pitt called it a great movie and declared the part would expand his acting horizons.[45] He expressed his intent to move on from "this 'pretty boy' thing ... and play someone with flaws."[46] His performance was critically well received, with Variety saying that it was screen acting at its best, further remarking on Pitt's ability to turn in a "determined, energetic, creditable job" as the detective.[47] Seven earned $327 million at the international box office.[27]
Following the success of Seven, Pitt took a supporting role as Jeffrey Goines in Terry Gilliam's 1995 science-fiction film 12 Monkeys. The movie received predominantly positive reviews, with Pitt praised in particular. Janet Maslin of the New York Times called Twelve Monkeys "fierce and disturbing" and remarked on Pitt's "startlingly frenzied performance", concluding that he "electrifies Jeffrey with a weird magnetism that becomes important later in the film."[48] He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor for the film[40] and received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.[49]
The following year he had a role in the legal drama Sleepers (1996), based on Lorenzo Carcaterra's novel of the same name.[50] The film received mixed reviews.[51] In the 1997 movie The Devil's Own Pitt starred, opposite Harrison Ford, as the Irish Republican Army terrorist Rory Devany,[52] a role for which he was required to learn an Irish accent.[53] Critical opinion was divided on his accent; "Pitt finds the right tone of moral ambiguity, but at times his Irish brogue is too convincing – it's hard to understand what he's saying", wrote the San Francisco Chronicle.[54] The Charleston Gazette opined that it had favored Pitt's accent over the movie.[55] The Devil's Own grossed $140 million worldwide,[27] but was a critical failure. Later that year he led as Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer in the Jean-Jacques Annaud film Seven Years in Tibet.[56] Pitt trained for months for the role, which demanded significant mountain climbing and trekking practice, including rock climbing in California and the European Alps with his co-star David Thewlis.[57] The film received mostly negative reviews, and was generally considered a disappointment.[58]
Pitt had the lead role in 1998's Meet Joe Black. He portrayed a personification of death inhabiting the body of a young man to learn what it is like to be human.[59] The film received mixed reviews, and many were critical of Pitt's performance. According to Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, Pitt was unable to "make an audience believe that he knows all the mysteries of death and eternity."[60] Roger Ebert stated "Pitt is a fine actor, but this performance is a miscalculation."[61]
In 1999, Pitt portrayed Tyler Durden in Fight Club,[62][63] a film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, directed by David Fincher.[64] Pitt prepared for the part with lessons in boxing, taekwondo, and grappling.[65] To look the part, Pitt consented to the removal of pieces of his front teeth which were restored when filming ended.[66] While promoting Fight Club, Pitt said that the film explored not taking one's aggressions out on someone else but to "have an experience, take a punch more and see how you come out on the other end."[67] Fight Club premiered at the 1999 Venice International Film Festival.[68] Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole,[69][70] Pitt's performance was widely praised. Paul Clinton of CNN noted the risky yet successful nature of the film,[71] while Variety remarked upon Pitt's ability to be "cool, charismatic and more dynamically physical, perhaps than ... his breakthrough role in Thelma and Louise".[72] In spite of a worse-than-expected box office performance, Fight Club became a cult classic after its DVD release in 2000.[73]
Following Fight Club, Pitt was cast as an Irish Gypsy boxer with a barely intelligible accent in Guy Ritchie's 2000 gangster film Snatch.[74] Several reviewers were critical of Snatch; however, most praised Pitt.[75] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said Pitt was "ideally cast as an Irishman whose accent is so thick even Brits can't understand him", going on to say that, before Snatch, Pitt had been "shackled by roles that called for brooding introspection, but recently he has found his calling in black comic outrageousness and flashy extroversion;"[76] while Amy Taubin of The Village Voice claimed that "Pitt gets maximum comic mileage out of a one-joke role".[77]
Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy García, Julia Roberts, cast of Ocean's Eleven and director Steven Soderbergh in December 2001
The following year Pitt starred opposite Julia Roberts in the romantic comedy The Mexican,[78] a film that garnered a range of reviews[79] but enjoyed box office success.[27] Pitt's next role, in 2001's $143 million-grossing Cold War thriller Spy Game,[27] was as Tom Bishop, an operative of the CIA's Special Activities Division, mentored by Robert Redford's character.[80] Mark Holcomb of Salon.com enjoyed the film, although he noted that neither Pitt nor Redford provided "much of an emotional connection for the audience".[81] On November 22, 2001, Pitt made a guest appearance in the eighth season of the television series Friends, playing a man with a grudge against Rachel Green, played by Jennifer Aniston, to whom Pitt was married at the time.[82] For this performance he was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.[83] In December 2001, Pitt had the role of Rusty Ryan in the heist film Ocean's Eleven, a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack original. He joined an ensemble cast including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy García, and Julia Roberts.[84] Well received by critics, Ocean's Eleven was highly successful at the box office, earning $450 million worldwide.[27]
Pitt appeared in two episodes of MTV's reality series Jackass in February 2002, first running through the streets of Los Angeles with several cast members in gorilla suits,[85] and participating in his own staged abduction in another episode.[86] In the same year, Pitt had a cameo role in George Clooney's directorial debut Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.[87] He took on his first voice-acting roles in 2003, speaking as the titular character of the DreamWorks animated film Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas[88] and playing Boomhauer's brother, Patch, in an episode of the animated television series King of the Hill.[89]
Pitt had two major film roles in 2004, starring as Achilles in Troy, and making a second appearance as Rusty Ryan, in the sequel Ocean's Twelve. He spent six months sword training before the filming of Troy, based on the Iliad.[90] An on-set injury to his Achilles tendon delayed production on the picture for several weeks.[91] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Times stated that Pitt excelled at such a demanding role.[92] Troy was the first film produced by Plan B Entertainment, a film production company he had founded two years earlier with Jennifer Aniston and Brad Grey, CEO of Paramount Pictures.[93] Ocean's Twelve earned $362 million worldwide,[27] and Pitt and Clooney's dynamic was described by CNN's Paul Clinton as "the best male chemistry since Paul Newman and Robert Redford."[94]
In 2005, Pitt starred in the Doug Liman-directed action comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which a bored married couple discover that each is an assassin sent to kill the other. The feature received reasonable reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who played his character's wife Jane Smith. The Star Tribune noted that "while the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry."[95] Mr. & Mrs. Smith earned $478 million worldwide, making it one of the biggest hits of 2005.[96]
For his next feature film, Pitt starred opposite Cate Blanchett in Alejandro González Iñárritu's multi-narrative drama Babel (2006).[97] Pitt's performance was critically well-received, and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said that he was credible and gave the film visibility.[98] Pitt later said he regarded taking the part as one of the best decisions of his career.[99] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival[100] and was later featured at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival.[101] Babel received seven Academy and Golden Globe award nominations, winning the Best Drama Golden Globe, and earned Pitt a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe.[40] That same year, Pitt's company Plan B Entertainment produced The Departed, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Pitt was credited on-screen as a producer; however, only Graham King was ruled eligible for the Oscar win.[102]
Reprising his role as Rusty Ryan in a third picture, Pitt starred in 2007's Ocean's Thirteen.[103] While less lucrative than the first two films, this sequel earned $311 million at the international box office.[27] Pitt's next film role was as American outlaw Jesse James in the 2007 Western drama The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, adapted from Ron Hansen's 1983 novel of the same name.[104] Directed by Andrew Dominik and produced by Pitt's company Plan B Entertainment, the film premiered at the 2007 Venice Film Festival,[105] with Pitt playing a "scary and charismatic" role, according to Lewis Beale of Film Journal International,[106] and earning Pitt the Volpi Cup award for Best Actor at the 64th Venice International Film Festival.[107] He eventually collected the award one year later at the 2008 festival.[108]
Pitt's next appearance was in the 2008 black comedy Burn After Reading, his first collaboration with the Coen brothers. The film received a positive reception from critics, with The Guardian calling it "a tightly wound, slickly plotted spy comedy",[109] noting that Pitt's performance was one of the funniest.[109] He was later cast as Benjamin Button, the lead in David Fincher's 2008 film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, a loosely adapted version of a 1921 short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The story follows a man who is born an octogenarian and ages in reverse,[110] with Pitt's "sensitive" performance making Benjamin Button a "timeless masterpiece," according to Michael Sragow of The Baltimore Sun.[111] The performance earned Pitt his first Screen Actors Guild Award nomination,[112] as well as a fourth Golden Globe and second Academy Award nomination,[40][113] all in the category for Best Actor. The film received thirteen Academy Award nominations in total, and grossed $329 million at the box office worldwide.[27]
Pitt's next leading role came in 2009 with the Quentin Tarantino-directed war film Inglourious Basterds, which premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.[114] Pitt played Lieutenant Aldo Raine, an American resistance fighter battling Nazis in German-occupied France.[115] The film was a box office hit, taking $311 million worldwide,[27] and garnered generally favorable reviews.[116] The film received multiple awards and nominations, including eight Academy Award nominations and seven MTV Movie Award nominations, including Best Male Performance for Pitt.[117][118] He next voiced the superhero character Metro Man in the 2010 animated feature Megamind.[119]
Pitt appeared in Terrence Malick's drama The Tree of Life, co-starring Sean Penn, which won the Palme d'Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.[120] In a performance that attracted strong praise, he portrayed the Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane in the drama Moneyball, which is based on the 2003 book of the same name written by Michael Lewis.[121] Moneyball received six Academy Award nominations including Best Actor for Pitt.[122]
His next role was as mob hitman Jackie Cogan in Andrew Dominik's 2012 Killing Them Softly, based on the novel Cogan's Trade by George V. Higgins.[123] In 2013, Pitt starred in World War Z, a thriller about a zombie apocalypse, based on Max Brooks' novel of the same name. Pitt also produced the film.[124] World War Z grossed over $539 million at the box office worldwide,[27] becoming Pitt's most commercially successful picture.[125] Next in 2013, he produced, and played a small role in, 12 Years a Slave, a historical drama based on the autobiography of Solomon Northup.[126] The film received critical acclaim[127] and was nominated for nine Academy Awards, winning three, including Best Picture.[128] Also in 2013, Pitt had a supporting role in Ridley Scott's The Counselor.[129]
Plan B productions landed its first television series on the 2013–2014 schedule, as their joint venture with ABC Studios, the sci-fi/fantasy drama Resurrection, was picked up by ABC.[130]
Pitt visited the University of Missouri campus in October 2004 to encourage students to vote in the 2004 U.S. presidential election,[131] in which he supported John Kerry.[131][132] Later in October he publicly supported the principle of public funding for embryonic stem-cell research. "We have to make sure that we open up these avenues so that our best and our brightest can go find these cures that they believe they will find," he said.[133] In support of this he endorsed Proposition 71, a California ballot initiative intended to provide state government funding for stem-cell research.[134]
Pitt supports the ONE Campaign, an organization aimed at combating AIDS and poverty in the developing world.[135][136] He narrated the 2005 PBS public television series Rx for Survival: A Global Health Challenge, which discusses current global health issues.[137] The following year Pitt and Jolie flew to Haiti, where they visited a school supported by Yéle Haïti, a charity founded by Haitian-born hip hop musician Wyclef Jean.[138] In May 2007, Pitt and Jolie donated $1 million to three organizations in Chad and Sudan dedicated to those affected by the crisis in the Darfur region.[139] Along with Clooney, Damon, Don Cheadle, David Pressman, and Jerry Weintraub, Pitt is one of the founders of Not On Our Watch, an organization that focuses global attention on stopping "mass atrocities".[140]
Pitt has a sustained interest in architecture[141] and has narrated Design e2, a PBS television series focused on worldwide efforts to build environmentally friendly structures through sustainable architecture and design.[142] He founded the Make It Right Foundation in 2006, organizing housing professionals in New Orleans to finance and construct 150 sustainable, affordable new houses in New Orleans's Ninth Ward following the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina.[143][144] The project involves 13 architectural firms and the environmental organization Global Green USA, with several of the firms donating their services.[145][146] Pitt and philanthropist Steve Bing have each committed $5 million in donations.[147] The first six homes were completed in October 2008,[148] and in September 2009 Pitt received an award in recognition of the project from the U.S. Green Building Council, a non-profit trade organization that promotes sustainability in how buildings are designed, built and operated.[149][150] Pitt met with U.S. President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi in March 2009 to promote his concept of green housing as a national model and to discuss federal funding possibilities.[151]
In September 2006, Pitt and Jolie established a charitable organization, the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, to aid humanitarian causes around the world.[152] The foundation made initial donations of $1 million each to Global Action for Children and Doctors Without Borders,[153] followed by an October 2006 donation of $100,000 to the Daniel Pearl Foundation, an organization created in memory of the late American journalist Daniel Pearl.[154] According to federal filings, Pitt and Jolie invested $8.5 million into the foundation in 2006; it gave away $2.4 million in 2006[155] and $3.4 million in 2007.[156] In June 2009 the Jolie-Pitt Foundation donated $1 million to a U.N. refugee agency to help Pakistanis displaced by fighting between troops and Taliban militants.[157] In January 2010 the foundation donated $1 million to Doctors Without Borders for emergency medical assistance to help victims of the Haiti earthquake.[158][159]
Pitt is a supporter of same-sex marriage.[160] In an October 2006 interview with Esquire, Pitt said that he would marry Jolie when everyone in America is legally able to marry.[161] In September 2008, he donated $100,000 to the campaign against California's 2008 ballot proposition Proposition 8, an initiative to overturn the state Supreme Court decision that had legalized same-sex marriage.[162] In March 2012, Pitt was featured in a performance of Dustin Lance Black's play, '8' — a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California's Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage — as Judge Vaughn Walker.[163]
In September 2012, Pitt reaffirmed his support of President Barack Obama, saying, "I am an Obama supporter and I'm backing his US election campaign."[164]
Pitt's sex appeal has been picked up by many sources including Empire, who named him one of the 25 sexiest stars in film history in 1995.[14] The same year, Pitt won People's Sexiest Man Alive, an accolade he won again in 2000.[1][165] Pitt appeared on Forbes's annual Celebrity 100 list of the 100 most powerful celebrities in 2006, 2007, and 2008, at No. 20, No. 5, and No. 10 respectively.[166][167][168] In 2007 he was listed among the Time 100, a compilation of the 100 most influential people in the world, as selected annually by TIME.[169] The magazine credited Pitt with using "his star power to get people to look [to where] cameras don't usually catch".[169] Pitt was again included in the Time 100 in 2009, this time in the Builders and Titans list.[170]
Starting in 2005, Pitt's relationship with Angelina Jolie became one of the most reported celebrity stories worldwide. After confirming that Jolie was pregnant in early 2006, the unprecedented media hype surrounding the couple reached what Reuters, in a story titled "The Brangelina fever," called "the point of insanity".[3] To avoid media attention, the couple flew to Namibia for the birth of their daughter Shiloh, "the most anticipated baby since Jesus Christ."[171] Similarly, intense media interest greeted the announcement two years later of Jolie's second pregnancy; for the two weeks Jolie spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade to report on the birth.[172]
In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Pitt, together with Jolie, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide.[173] Pitt has appeared in several television commercials. For the U.S. market, he starred in a Heineken commercial aired during the 2005 Super Bowl; it was directed by David Fincher, who had directed Pitt in Seven, Fight Club and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.[174] Other commercial appearances came in television spots including SoftBank and Edwin Jeans.[175]
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Pitt was involved in successive relationships with several of his co-stars, including Robin Givens (Head of the Class),[176] Jill Schoelen (Cutting Class),[176] and Juliette Lewis (Too Young to Die? and Kalifornia), who was ten years his junior, and was 16 years old, when they started dating.[30] In addition, Pitt had a much-publicized romance and engagement to his Seven co-star Gwyneth Paltrow, whom he dated from 1994 to 1997.[176]
Pitt met Friends actress Jennifer Aniston in 1998 and married her in a private wedding ceremony in Malibu on July 29, 2000. For years their marriage was considered a rare Hollywood success;[177] however, in January 2005, Pitt and Aniston announced they had decided to separate. Two months later Aniston filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.[178] Pitt and Aniston's divorce was finalized by the Los Angeles Superior Court on October 2, 2005.[178] Despite media reports that Pitt and Aniston had an acrimonious relationship, Pitt said in a February 2009 interview that he and Aniston "check in with each other", adding that they were both big parts of each other's lives.[179]
During Pitt's divorce proceedings, his involvement with his Mr. & Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie attracted media attention. While Pitt denied claims of adultery, he admitted that he "fell in love" with Jolie on the set.[180] In April 2005, one month after Aniston filed for divorce, a set of paparazzi photographs emerged showing Pitt, Jolie and her son Maddox at a beach in Kenya; the press interpreted the pictures as evidence of a relationship between Pitt and Jolie. During 2005, the two were seen together with increasing frequency, and the entertainment media dubbed the couple "Brangelina".[181] On January 11, 2006, Jolie confirmed to People that she was pregnant with Pitt's child, thereby publicly acknowledging their relationship for the first time. Pitt and Jolie announced their engagement in April 2012 after seven years together.[182]
born November 29, 2003 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; adopted March 15, 2007 by Jolie; adopted February 21, 2008 by Pitt
In July 2005, Pitt accompanied Jolie to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where she adopted her second child, six-month-old Zahara Marley.[183] On January 19, 2006, a California judge granted Jolie's request to change the children's surnames from "Jolie" to "Jolie-Pitt".[184] The adoptions were finalized soon after.[185]
Jolie gave birth to daughter Shiloh Nouvel in Swakopmund, Namibia, on May 27, 2006. Pitt confirmed that their newborn daughter would have a Namibian passport.[186] The couple sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images; the North American rights were purchased by People for over $4.1 million, while Hello! obtained the British rights for approximately $3.5 million. The proceeds from the sale were donated to charities serving African children.[187] Madame Tussauds in New York unveiled a wax figure of two-month-old Shiloh; it marked the first time an infant was recreated in wax by Madame Tussauds.[188]
On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted three-year-old Pax Thien from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[189] Pitt adopted Pax in the United States on February 21, 2008.[190]
At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins.[191] She gave birth to son Knox Léon and daughter Vivienne Marcheline on July 12, 2008 in Nice, France.[192][better source needed] The rights for the first images of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello! for $14 million—the most expensive celebrity pictures ever taken.[193][194] The couple donated the proceeds to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.[193][195]

                His mere presence ensures a film is a box office hit. From sultry cowboy in Thelma & Louise to skirt-wearing warrior.Brad Pitt was born William Bradley Pitt to strict Baptists William A. Pitt and Jane Etta Hillhouse. The eldest of three children, Pitt has a brother, Doug (b. 1966) and a sister, Julie (b. 1969). Soon after his birth, the family moved to Springfield, Missouri, where his father ran a trucking company. He attended Kickapoo High School where he joined the tennis, golf and swimming teams, and was a member of the choir, the forensics club, the debating club and the student council. Following his graduation from school in 1982, Pitt attended the University of Missouri, majoring in Journalism and Advertising. He dropped out with only two credits left to gain his degree, and set off for California to pursue his dream of a Hollywood acting career. Whilst taking acting lessons, Pitt did part-time work including being a furniture mover, a chauffeur and a costume-wearing mascot for a restaurant chain. Finally, in the late 1980s, he started getting some television work, which included appearing in ‘Dallas’, ’21 Jump Street’, ‘Growing Pains’, ‘Thirtysomething’, ‘Freddy’s Nightmares’, ‘Another World’, and ‘Head of Class’. Pitt’s debut on the big screen was in an uncredited part as a waiter in ‘No Man's Land’ (1987). A number of small roles followed before he landed a starring role in the crime drama made-for-television movie ‘Too Young to Die?’ (1990), co-starring Juliette Lewis. Pitt finally gained notice in Ridley Scott’s ‘Thelma & Louise’ (1991), starring Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis and Harvey Keitel. His role as scruffy layabout J.D., despite being a small one involving a mere fourteen minutes of screen time, was his big break. He played the memorable role of Paul Maclean in Robert Redford’s ‘A River Runs Through It’ (1992), a true story set in Montana and based on the novel by Norman Maclean. He was Floyd in ‘True Romance’ (1993), the thriller written by Quentin Tarantino, starring Patricia Arquette, Christian Slater and Val Kilmer. ‘Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles’ (1994) starred Pitt as the unforgettable Louis de Pointe du Lac opposite Tom Cruise in the horror/fantasy that won him two 1995 MTV Movie Awards, for Best Male Performance and Most Desirable Male. He was also nominated for Best Actor by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, and for Best On-Screen Duo in the 1995 MTV Movie Awards. Having certainly proved his capabilities as an actor, as well as his box office 'bank-ability', Pitt continued to give outstanding performances in his next three movies. He was cast as the wild and winsome Tristan Ludlow in ‘Legends of the Fall’ (1994), an epic tale of three brothers and their father, with Anthony Hopkins, Aidan Quinn and Julia Ormond. For this role, he received a 1995 Golden Globes award nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture. In ‘Se7en’ (1995), the graphic thriller about a twisted serial killer using the seven deadly sins as his modus operandi, Pitt played Detective David Mills and won the 1996 MTV Movie Award for Most Desirable Male and was nominated for the 1996 MTV Movie Awards Best On-Screen Duo. He then received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, playing Jeffrey Goines in ‘Twelve Monkeys’ (1995) starring Bruce Willis and Jon Seda, and won a number of awards for Best Supporting Actor.The following year, he played Michael Sullivan in ‘Sleepers’ (1996), a story about four boys growing up in Hell’s Kitchen, New York, based on the book by Lorenzo Carcaterra. ‘The Devil’s Own’ (1997) with Harrison Ford was next and then Pitt’s pet project, ‘Seven Years in Tibet’ (1997). It was the true story of Heinrich Harrer, an Austrian mountain climber who befriended the Dalai Lama at the time of China’s takeover of Tibet. Pitt won the 1998 Rembrandt Award for Best Actor but had to deal with much controversy surrounding the film. The Chinese government did not approve of the portrayal of Chinese military officers and the Dalai Lama, and strongly discouraged both the production and the release of the film. As a result, both Pitt and his co-star David Thewlis were banned from ever entering China. The next two films for which Pitt received rave critical reviews were ‘Fight Club’ (1999), playing Tyler Durden alongside Edward Norton and Helen Bonham Carter, and the role of Mickey O’Neil in Guy Ritchie’s British crime thriller ‘Snatch’ (2000) with Vinnie Jones and Benicio Del Toro. Landing the part of Rusty Ryan in Steven Soderbergh’s hugely successful ‘Ocean's Eleven’ (2001) found Pitt working with George Clooney, Matt Damon, Elliot Gould, Bernie Mac, Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia. The sequel, ‘Ocean's Twelve’ (2004), was just as eagerly received by the viewing public and the cast were joined this time by Catherine Zeta-Jones. Pitt has always had a weakness for his leading ladies and has always been a dogged by the tabloids. His hatred of the paparazzi is well known and he will go to extreme lengths to protect his privacy. In the past, he was romantically linked to Julia Ormonde, Robin Givens, Geena Davis, Shalene McCall, Shirley Walsh and Alice Wilkinson. Pitt was with Juliette Lewis, his co-star in ‘Too Young to Die?’ (1990), for three years and enjoyed a long-term relationship with ‘Se7en’ (1995) co-star Gwyneth Paltrow. They were engaged in December 1996, but split up in June 1997. On 29 July 2000, Pitt married ‘Friends’ star Jennifer Aniston in a fabulous cliff-top ceremony in Malibu. They became Hollywood’s ‘Golden Couple’ and together with Paramount Pictures head Brad Grey, set up Plan B Entertainment, a production company that produced Tim Burton’s ‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’ (2005) starring Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. However, Pitt became the sole owner of the company in 2006 and after four and a half years of marriage, he walked out on Aniston, never once looking back, much to her dismay. Pitt starred in ‘Mr & Mrs Smith’ (2005) with Angelina Jolie and photographs began appearing in the media of the two of them looking remarkably romantic. They were seen together on holiday in Kenya, Britain and France, fuelling media speculation that they were a couple. On 7 January 2005, Pitt and Aniston announced their split after what they said was “much thoughtful consideration”, saying in a joint statement: “We happily remain committed and caring friends with great love and admiration for one another”. Aniston filed for divorce on 25 March 2005 and it was finalised on 2 October 2005.In an insensitive photo shoot for W magazine, Pitt and Jolie posed as a happy 1960s couple with a brood of children for the July 2005 edition. Following his divorce, Pitt started dating Jolie and the couple were dubbed “Brangelina” by the media. Pitt readily took on the role of ‘dad’ to Jolie’s two adopted children, son Maddox (from Cambodia) and daughter Zahara (from Ethiopia). In December 2005, they finally announced to the world that they were a couple and that Pitt wanted to adopt her children, legally changing their surname to Jolie-Pitt. On 27 May 2006, Jolie gave birth to their daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in Swakopmund, Namibia, by caesarean section. Pitt was present at the birth and cut the umbilical cord, a very proud moment for him. Somewhat of a humanitarian, Pitt actively supports AIDS research and global environmental issues. Showing his solidarity for the fight against world poverty, he was a presenter at the July 2005 Live8 benefit concert in London’s Hyde Park. He is a spokesman for the ONE campaign in the US, part of the international Make Poverty History movement, and travelled to Turkey in 2001 to entertain the American troops. Pitt was also involved in the reconstruction of New Orleans after the Katrina hurricane disaster. He voiced his support for same-sex marriages in the October 2006 issue of Esquire magazine. Interested in architecture, Pitt has studied Computer Aided Design and been involved in various design projects on his own homes. The actor, who refuses to be typecast and who always accepts challenging roles, is not about to slow down. In 2006, Pitt appeared opposite Cate Blanchett in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's film entitled ‘Babel’, a thriller set in Morocco, Tunisia, Mexico and Japan. The film won critical acclaim and Pitt’s portrayal of the character Richard earned him a nomination for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor. He also landed nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor. He also took on an entirely different character in ‘The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford’ in 2007 and appeared in ‘Ocean’s Thirteen’. Further recognition for the talented star followed with the Coen Brothers’ ‘Burn After Reading’ in 2008, which led to nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, the Detroit Film Critics Society Award for Best Cast and the Houston Film Critics Society Award for Best Supporting Actor. Pitt’s versatility was further highlighted in his next two films, ‘The Curious Case of Benjamin Button’ (2008) and ‘Inglourious Basterds’ (2009), which both attracted a host of award nominations, including an Academy Award for Best Actor for the former. The prolific actor continues to play roles both in front of the camera and behind the scenes as a producer with credits in hits including 2010's ‘Kick Ass’ and ‘Eat Pray Love’.

=======================================================
From All Movie Guide: The son of a trucking company manager, Brad Pitt was born December 18, 1963, in Shawnee, OK. Raised in Missouri as the oldest of three children, and brought up in a strict Baptist household, Pitt enrolled at the University of Missouri, following high school graduation, studying journalism and advertising. However, after discovering his love of acting, he dropped out of college two credit hours before he could graduate and moved to Hollywood. Once in California, Pitt took acting classes and supported himself with a variety of odd jobs that included chauffeuring strippers to private parties, waiting tables, and wearing a giant chicken suit for a local restaurant chain. His first break came when he landed a small recurring role on Dallas, and a part in a teenage-slasher movie, Cutting Class (1989) (opposite Roddy McDowall), marked his inauspicious entrance into the world of feature films. The previous year, Pitt's acting experience had been limited to the TV movie A Stoning in Fulgham County (1988). 1991 marked the end of Pitt's obscurity, as it was the year he made his appearance in Thelma & Louise (1991) as the wickedly charming drifter who seduces Geena Davis and then robs her blind.  After becoming famous practically overnight, Pitt unfortunately chose to channel his newfound celebrity into Ralph Bakshi's disastrous animation/live action combo Cool World (1992). Following this misstep, Pitt took a starring role in director Tom Di Cillo's independent film Johnny Suede. The film failed to score with critics or at the box office and Pitt's documented clashes with the director allegedly inspired Di Cillo to pattern the character of the vain and egotistical Chad Palomino, in his 1995 Living in Oblivion, after the actor. Pitt's next venture, Robert Redford's lyrical fly-fishing drama A River Runs Through It (2002), gave the actor a much-needed chance to prove that he had talent in addition to physical appeal.Following his performance in Redford's film, Pitt appeared in Kalifornia and True Romance (both 1993), two road movies featuring fallen women and violent sociopaths. Pitt's next major role did not arrive until early 1994, when he was cast as the lead of the gorgeously photographed Legends of the Fall. As he did in A River Runs Through It, Pitt portrayed a free-spirited, strong-willed brother, but this time had greater opportunity to further develop his enigmatic character. Later that same year, fans watched in anticipation as Pitt exchanged his outdoorsy persona for the brooding, gothic posturing of Anne Rice's tortured vampire Louis in the film adaptation of {-Interview With the Vampire}. Pitt next starred in the forgettable romantic comedy The Favor (1994) before going on to play a rookie detective investigating a series of gruesome crimes opposite Morgan Freeman in Seven (1995). In 1997, Pitt received a Golden Globe award and an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a visionary mental patient in Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys; the same year, Pitt attempted an Austrian accent and put on a backpack to play mountaineer Heinrich Harrar in Seven Years in Tibet. The film met with mixed reviews and generated a fair amount of controversy, thanks in part to the revelation that the real-life Harrar had in fact been a Nazi. Following Tibet, Pitt traveled in a less inflammatory direction with Alan J. Pakula's The Devil's Own, in which he starred with fellow screen icon Harrison Ford. Despite this seemingly faultless pairing, the film was a relative critical and box-office failure. In 1998, Pitt tried his hand at romantic drama, portraying Death in Meet Joe Black, the most expensive non-special effects film ever made. Pitt's penchant for quirk was prevalent with his cameo in the surreal comic fantasy Being John Malkovich (1999) and carried over into his role as Tyler Durden, the mysterious and anti-materialistic soap salesman in David Fincher's controversial Fight Club the same year. The odd characterizations didn't let up with his appearance as the audibly indecipherable pugilist in Guy Ritchie's eagerly anticipated follow-up to Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch (2000).
In July of 2000, the man voted "Most Sexy Actor Alive" by virtually every entertainment publication currently in circulation crushed the hearts of millions of adoring female fans when he wed popular film and television actress Jennifer Aniston in a relatively modest (at least by Hollywood standards) and intimate service.Pitt's next turn on the big screen found him re-teamed with Robert Redford, this time sharing the screen with the A River Runs Through It director in the espionage thriller Spy Game (2001). A fairly retro-straight-laced role for an actor who had become identified with his increasingly eccentric roles, he was soon cast in Steven Soderbergh's remake of the Rat Pack classic Ocean's 11 (2001), the tale of a group of criminals who plot to rob a string of casinos. Following a decidedly busy 2001 that also included a lead role opposite Julia Roberts in the romantic crime-comedy The Mexican, Pitt was virtually absent from the big-screen over the next three years. After walking away from the ambitious and troubled  Darren Aronofsky production The Fountain, he popped up for a very brief cameo in pal George Clooney's 2002 directorial debut Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and lent his voice to the animated adventure Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas, but spent the majority of his time working on the historical epic Troy (2004). Directed by Wolfgang Peterson, the film employed a huge cast, crew and budget.The media engulfed Pitt's next screen role with tabloid fervor, as it cast him opposite bombshell Angelina Jolie. While the comedic actioner Mr. and Mrs. Smith grossed dollar one at the box office, the stars' off-camera relationship that made some of 2005's biggest headlines. Before long, Pitt had split from his wife Jennifer Aniston and adopted Jolie's two children. The family expanded to three in 2006 with the birth of the couple's first child, to four in 2007 with the adoption of a Vietnamese boy, and finally to six in 2008, with the birth of fraternal twins.In addition to increasing his family in 2006, Pitt also padded his filmography as a producer on a number of projects, including Martin Scorsese's The Departed, the Best Picture Winner for 2006. He also acted opposite Cate Blanchett in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's drama Babel. Interestingly, that film hit theaters the same year as The Fountain, a film that was originally set to star the duo. Pitt also stayed busy as an actor, reteaming with many familiar on-screen pals for Ocean's Thirteen. At about the same time, Pitt teamed up with Ridley Scott to co-produce a period western,  The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford; Pitt also stars in the film, as James. The year 2007 found Pitt involved, simultaneously, in a number of increasingly intelligent and distinguished projects. He signed on to reteam with David Fincher for the first occasion since Fight Club, with {-The Curious Case of Benjamin Button} - a bittersweet fantasy, adapted by Forrest Gump scribe Eric Roth from an F. Scott Fitzgerald story, about a man who falls in love while he is aging in reverse. When the special effects heavy film hit theaters in time for awards season in 2008, Pitt garnered a Best Actor nomination from both the Academy and the Screen Actors Guild. Also in 2007, Pitt produced an  adaptation of Marianne Pearl's memoir A Mighty Heart that starred Angelina Jolie. In the years that followed, Pitt remained supremely busy. He delivered a funny lead performance as Lt. Aldo Raine in Quentin Tarantino's blistering World War II saga Inglourious Basterds (2009), then did some of the most highly-praised work of his career as a disciplinarian father in Terence Malick's The Tree of Life (2011) - a sprawling, cerebral phantasmorgia on the meaning of life and death that became one of the critical sensations of the year. He also won a great deal of praise for his turn as Billy Beane in Bennett Miller's adaptation of the non-fiction book Moneyball, a role that not only earned him critical raves but Best Actor nominations from the Academy, BAFTA, the Broadcast Film Association, the Golden Globes, and won him the New York Film Critics Circle award (though the institution also recognized his work in Tree of Life as figuring into their decision). ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi
