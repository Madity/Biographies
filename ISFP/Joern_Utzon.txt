Danish architect Jørn Utzon was born in 1918. While in secondary school, he began helping his father, director of a shipyard in Alborg, Denmark, and brilliant naval architect, by studying new designs, drawing up plans and making models. This activity opened another possibility—that of training to be a naval architect like his father.
However, one of his father’s cousins, Einar Utzon-Frank, was a sculptor as well as a professor at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. He influenced Jørn, who took an interest in sculpting, and after secondary school, he won admission to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen.
When he graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in 1942, he, like many architects affected by World War II, fled to neutral Sweden where he was employed in the Stockholm office of Hakon Ahlberg for the duration of the war. He then went to Finland to work with Alvar Aalto.
An admirer of the ideas of Gunnar Asplund, as well as Frank Lloyd Wright while still in school, Utzon acknowledges that Aalto, Asplund and Wright were all major influences in his own work. Over the next decade, he traveled extensively, visiting Morocco, Mexico, the United States, China, Japan, India, and Australia, the latter destined to become a major factor in his life.
Most of Utzon’s projects have been completed in his native Denmark, but he is best known for the Sydney Opera House, an iconic building of curving roof forms. Construction began in 1959 and was not complete until 1973, and Utzon left the project in 1966 after bitter arguments with Australian officials regarding cost and schedule issues.
His other well known projects include the Fredensborg Housing Estate (1959-62), the Kingo Housing Estate (1956-58), Bagsvaerd Church (1973-76), and the Skagen Nature Center (2001), all in Denmark.
The Kingo Houses in Helsingør are sixty-three L-shaped houses that were built in rows following the contours of the site, providing views for each house, and access to sunlight and shelter from the wind. The Kingo Houses are often praised for their combination of simplicity and inventiveness.
Utzon's next major design, after returning to Denmark from Sydney, was the Bagsvaerd Church in Copenhagen. Utzon planned the interior vaults after being inspired by banks of clouds.
Utzon moved to the Spanish island of Majorca in the early 1970s. With his wife he lived in a house designed by himself, Can Feliz, until his death in 2008. The architecture is very solid and simple. A small window allows light to funnel in to the living space and views toward the sea ...

“To me it is a great joy to know how much the building is loved, by Australians in general and by Sydneysiders in particular”Jørn Utzon 
The architect of Sydney Opera House, Jørn Utzon was a relatively unknown 38 year old Dane until January 29, 1957 when his entry, scheme number 218, was announced winner of the ‘International competition for a national opera house at Bennelong Point, Sydney’. With his vision the City of Sydney was to become an international city.
Jørn Utzon was born on April 9,1918 in Copenhagen. He grew up in the town of Aalborg, where his father was a naval architect and engineer and director of the local shipyard. A keen sailor, Utzon originally intended to follow his father as a naval engineer, but opted to study Architecture at the Copenhagen Royal Academy of Arts. He received his Diploma in Architecture from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Copenhagen. On graduating in 1942, he worked in Sweden until the end of World War II. He was influenced by Gunnar Asplund and Later Alvar Aalto, with whom he worked in Finland for a short period after the war. In 1949 he received a grant that enabled him and his wife Lis to travel extensively in USA and Mexico, coming into contact with some of the most influential architects of his day, like Frank Lloyd Wright’s school at Taliesin, Mies van der Rohe, Ray and Charles Eames, Richard Neutra and others. He was also in Paris meeting with Le Corbusier and the sculptor Henri Laurens, whose influence taught him much about form.A major project took him to Morocco; unfortunately the project was not realized, but he used the opportunity to walk along the Atlas mountain range, where he was very inspired by the indigenous adobe architecture. He returned to Copenhagen in 1950 to open his own architectural practice.
In 1956 the New South Wales Premier, The Hon Joe Cahill, announced an international competition for the design of an opera house for Sydney which attracted more than 200 entries from around the world. After having won number of smaller architectural competitions, Utzon submitted his vision for the Sydney Opera House to the New South Wales Government.
Story goes that during the judging of the competition one of the judges, renowned American architect, Eero Saarinen, arrived in Sydney after the other three judges had started assessing the entries. He looked through their rejected entries and stopped at the Utzon design declaring it to be outstanding.
Utzon’s competition entry was a schematic design, clearly explaining the concept for the building. The sketches and “geometrically undefined” curves of course needed to be developed for the building to be built. This is quite normal for competition projects. Utzon himself was sure it could be built and in the pioneering spirit present in Sydney at the time, construction went ahead.
It was Utzon’s life and travels that had shaped his ideas for the Sydney Opera House. Though he had never visited the site, he used his maritime background to study naval charts of Sydney harbour. His early exposure to shipbuilding provided the inspiration for the Sydney Opera House ‘sails’ and would also help him solve the challenges of their construction. From his travels to Mexico, he had the idea of placing his building on a wide horizontal platform.
Construction of the podium began on 2 March 1959 with a ground breaking ceremony presided over by NSW Premier The Hon Joe Cahill. Over several years Utzon gradually made changes from his original concept designs in order to develop a way to construct the large shells that cover the two halls. After extensive testing, Utzon and engineer Ove Arup developed a design based on the complex sections of a sphere.
From 1964 the pre-cast rib vaults of the shells began to be erected on the completed podium. The construction of the roof brought together some of the world's best construction engineers and craftsmen for this complex stage of the project, devising new and innovative techniques to find the goal of architectural perfection and in doing so, create a major visual impact which delivered Utzon’s vision.  
Although Utzon had spectacular plans for the interior of the completed shells he was unable to realise this part of his design. In mid 1965 a new Liberal government was elected in the State of NSW. The Minster of Works Davis Hughes began questioning Utzon's designs, schedules and cost estimates and eventually stopped payments to Utzon who was forced to withdraw as chief architect in February 1966.
Following Utzon’s letter of resignation there were protests and marches through the streets of Sydney led by Australian architect Harry Seidler, author Patrick White and others, demanding Utzon be reinstated as architect. The NSW government did not offer him this role, Jørn Utzon left the country at the end of April 1966 with his family, never to return to see his masterpiece again.
When Sydney Opera House was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on October 20, 1973, Utzon was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Institute of Architects Australia but was not present at the opening ceremony.
After his work on Sydney Opera House, Jørn Utzon completed other architectural projects such as the Can Lis in Majorca (1972), the Paustian Furniture Store in Copenhagen (1987) and Can Feliz in Majorca (1995). The principles behind his renowned Bagsværd Church (1976) in the suburbs of Copenhagen and his parliament building in Kuwait (1983) can be traced directly back to his original vision for Sydney Opera House.
In 1999 the NSW Government and Sydney Opera House Trust were delighted to be able to reunite the man and his masterpiece. After a number of approaches, conversations and finally meetings, Utzon agreed to be re-engaged to develop a set of Design Principles to act as a permanent reference to guide all future changes to the building.
Utzon said of the Design Principles, published in 2002, "My job is to articulate the overall vision and detailed design principles for the site, and for the form of the building and its interior".
“I like to think the Sydney Opera House is like a musical instrument, and like any fine instrument, it needs a little maintenance and fine tuning, from time to time, if it is to keep on performing at the highest level."
The reconciliation with the Sydney Opera House in 1999 brought Utzon great pleasure. In 2003, the same year the Opera House celebrated its 30th birthday, Jørn Utzon was awarded the Pritzker Prize for Architecture, the highest award in its field. A year later on 16 September 2004, NSW Premier The Hon Bob Carr officially opened the newly refurbished Reception Hall, renamed the Utzon Room. When asked if he would agree to the room being named after him Utzon said it was the greatest honour he could ever receive. “It (the naming) gives me the greatest pleasure and satisfaction. I don’t think you can give me more joy as the architect. It supersedes any medal of any kind that I could get and have got.” With its wide, bare spaces, its colourful tapestry (designed by Utzon himself), pale timbered floor and a ceiling of folded concrete beams, it was exactly as he had dreamed it.
Since the opening of the Utzon Room in 2004, which is the first authentic Utzon interior in the building, Jørn Utzon was the architect for several other projects at Sydney Opera House, collaborating with his architect son Jan Utzon and Australian architect Richard Johnson on The Colonnade, the Accessibility and Western Foyers Project and the concept designs for the Opera Theatre Renewal Project.
The Colonnade was the first exterior change to the building since it opened. Nine openings were created along the Harbour Bridge side of Sydney Opera House into the shared foyers for the Playhouse, The Studio and Drama Theatre – six new large deep set windows and three glass doors. The foyers are now flooded with natural light and for the first time patrons in these venues can enjoy harbour and city views. 
The Colonnade was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in March 2006. Importantly, this opportunity was used by the Queen to formally recognise the building’s visionary architect, Jørn Utzon. Jan Utzon represented his father in the Colonnade opening ceremony, saying his father "is too old by now to take the long flight to Australia. But he lives and breathes the Opera House, and as its creator he just has to close his eyes to see it."
Utzon's work included collaborating on the Accessibility and Western Foyers Project, completed in 2009, which has greatly improved accessibility for visitors to Sydney Opera House. He also created concept designs for a more extreme interior renewal project, which principally aims to alleviate some of the current constraints in staging and performance in the Opera Theatre.
When this project was announced in August 2006, Utzon said, “From my point of view, and our point of view as architects, we want to give spectators and visitors to the Opera House a beautiful extra experience and we are so happy to have this opportunity to create such a lively, marvellous atmosphere.”
Jørn Utzon died peacefully in his sleep in Copenhagen on 29 November 2008 aged 90. His legacy lives on through the World Heritage listed Sydney Opera House and his Design Principles as a permanent record of his vision for the place, as well as the many other magnificent structures he designed around the world.

He was born in Copenhagen as the son of a naval engineer, and grew up in Denmark. In 1957 he won the competition for a new opera house in Sydney, Australia. In the following years, Utzon gradually developed a way to construct the large shells that cover the two halls.
He also had spectacular plans for the interior of these halls, but due to political changes, the newly elected state government of New South Wales suddenly stopped the payments to Utzon and he had to leave the country in 1966, leaving the unfinished project behind. He has never returned to Australia since.
The Sydney Opera House was finally completed in 1973 and is one of the world's most recognizable buildings.
In March 2003, Utzon was awarded an honorary doctorate for his work on the Opera House by the University of Sydney. Utzon's son accepted the award on his behalf as he himself was too ill to come to Australia. He is also now involved in redesigning the house, and in particular, the reception hall, following an agreement made in 2000.
Among other of Jørn Utzon's projects are: Planetstaden housing project - Lund, Sweden (1958) - Kingohusene housing project - Elsinore (1960), The Kuwait Assembly Hall (1972), Can Lis - Mallorca (1972), Bagsværd Church - Copenhagen (1976), The Paustian Furniture Store - Copenhagen (1987), Can Feliz - Mallorca (1995).

Danish architect. He studied with Fisker and worked briefly with Aalto. During 1949 he spent a week at Taliesin East with F. L. Wright (who, with Le Corbusier, was a major influence on his conception of architecture) prior to visiting Central America, where his encounters with Meso-American temple remains were to leave a lasting impression, notably in his frequent use of the platform or plinth in his own work. This featured in the Utzon House, Hellebaek, Helsingør (1952–3), and, on the grand scale, in the competition-winning design for the Sydney Opera House and Concert Hall, Australia (1956–73), in which the platform contained all the service-spaces and provided a support for, and visual foil to, the huge sail-like shell-vaults that soar above the harbour. Developed in collaboration with the engineers Ove Arup & Partners, the Sydney project proved technically demanding, and in 1966 Utzon withdrew when political arguments made his position impossible.Utzon's most influential designs were for courtyard-houses, a theme he first explored in the unbuilt competition-winning proposals for Skåna in Sweden (1954) and subsequently realized in the Kingo Houses at Helsingør (1956–60) and in a widely-acclaimed development at Fredensborg (1962–3), both in Denmark. The freely arranged site-plans of these schemes used the additive principle of composition that was also to become the basis of his ideas for more flexible approaches to industrialized building. These designs included the ‘Espansiva’ housing system (1969), developed for the Danish timber-building industry and modelled on traditional Japanese houses; a prototype building for a new college in Herning (1967); the impressive unrealized proposal (using precast concrete components) for a sports complex in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (1968); and the National Assembly Building, Kuwait (1972–85-restored following severe damage in the 1990 Gulf War), built using large-scale components cast on site. Utzon's contract did not however include the interiors, and the only public building realized wholly in accordance with his designs was the Bagsvaerd Church, near Copenhagen (1967–77), where the billowy ‘cloud-vaults’ form a striking contrast to the modest, system-built exterior. In partnership with his two architect-sons, Jan (1944– ) and Kim (1957– ), Utzon realized the Paustian Furniture Store, Nordhavn, Copenhagen (1987), by when he was spending much of his time at ‘Can Lis’, his house on a cliff-top near Porto Petro, Mallorca, Spain (1971–3). More recently another generation of Utzons (Jan's son and daughter) have become active in the firm: they are Jeppe (1970– ) and Kickan (1971– ).

Utzon, Jørn, 1918-2008, Danish architect, grad. Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Copenhagen (1942). He worked for Eric Gunnar Asplund in Sweden and Alvar Aalto in Finland before opening (1950) his own Copenhagen architectural office. Notable among his early works are several Danish projects: his house at Hedllebæk (1952), a private home at Holte (1953), and two housing developments (1956 and 1957-60). In 1957 Utzon won the Sydney Opera House competition with a design that featured curving saillike roofs, and he moved (1962) to Australia to be close to the project. Soon in conflict with Australia's public works minister over cost overruns and delays, Utzon left the country and the project in 1966. In 1999, however, he was hired by the opera house as a design consultant. His subsequent renovations of the interior were supervised by his architect son Jan, but Utzon never saw his completed masterpiece. His later projects included the Bagsværd Church, Copenhagen (1976), the Kuwait National Assembly building (1982), and the Skagen Nature Center (2001). Utzon was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 2003.BibliographySee biography by P. Drew (1999); studies by T. Faber (1991), P. Drew (1995), H. S. Møller and V. Udsen (2004), P. Murray (2004), M.

=======================================================
Jørn Utzon was a Danish architect and furniture designer. Utzon was born in Copenhagen (København) in 1918. While he was still a baby his father moved the family to Aalborg in Northern Jutland (Jylland). Utzon’s father “Aage Utzon” was a brilliant naval architect at the Aalborg shipyard.
While Utzon was still in secondary school he began helping his father in the marine workshops by studying new designs, drawing up plans and even designing new ship models. Utzon’s early exposure to the designing of ships had a great influence on his future career in architecture. It was hear where he first faced the challenges of implementing functional as well as aesthetically pleasing ships.
Jørn Utzon came from a wealthy family and thus went to the private St. Mark’s Monastary School (Klostermarkskole) and later to the Aalborg Cathedral School (Aalborg Katedralskole). However, Utzon always struggled with his studies because of his dyslexia. It is interesting to note that Denmark's famous fairytale writer Hans Christian Andersen also suffered from dyslexia.
In 1930 Jørn Utzon’s family took a trip to Stockholm, Sweden. While in Stockholm they visited an exhibition which featured the works of Erik Gunnar Asplund, who was arguably the most famous Swedish architect at the time. In the 1920’s Asplund helped put Swedish architecture on the world map with his design for the Stockholm Public Library (Stockholms Stadsbibliotek). This exhibition would have a great impression on Utzon and the rest of his family. In fact Utzon’s family were so inspired by some of the exhibits that they renovated their own house to follow these new trends.
When Utzon completed his secondary schooling he decided to apply to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. In fact, Utzon’s father had a cousin named Einar Utzon-Frank, who was a sculptor as well as a professor at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts at the time. During this period of his life Jørn was very interested in sculpting, and he was fortunate enough to be accepted to the Royal Academy.  
So in 1937 Jørn Utzon moved to Copenhagen and began his studies at the famous Royal Academy of Fine Arts. At the Academy Utzon was instructed by the famous architects Kay Fisker and Steen Eiler Rasmussen. Over the next five years Utzon worked hard to develop his talent and he graduated in 1942.
Later in 1942 Utzon, like many Danish architects affected by World War II, fled to neutral Sweden where he was employed in the Stockholm office of Hakon Ahlberg for the duration of the war. In Sweden he was joined by fellow Danish architects Arne Jacobsen, Poul Henningsen, Halldor Gunnløgsson, and Tobias Faber amongst others. When the war ended he did not immediately return to Denmark, instead going to Finland for a short time to work with great Finish architect Alvar Aalto.
After the German surrender in 1945 Utzon would help with the reconstruction of Europe. He designed a number of temporary houses in the Netherlands. In the latter part of 1945 Utzon returned to Denmark where he, along with Tobias Faber, participated in several architectural competitions. Utzon’s submissions showed that he had a true understanding of the complex problem of integrating nature into architecture; or rather the problem of designing a building which fits comfortably into its natural surroundings. This was an important skill which characterized much of his work.
From 1947-1949 Utzon spent much of his time abroad. He spent time in Morocco, the United States and Mexico. In Morocco he produced some designs, and he was introduced to Islamic architecture. Utzon was impressed with wisdom of ordinary people in respect to building and architecture. It was here that his appreciation for the relationship between a building and the material used in its construction reached fruition. This appreciation was clear throughout Utzon’s career and he was always interested in using local materials in the construction of his designs. He felt that this helped a building fit better into its natural surroundings.
In early 1949 Utzon received a scholarship to go to the U.S. and Mexico. In the U.S. he met the world famous American architects Ray and Charles Eames, Frank Lloyd Wright; as well as the famous German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Utzon then traveled to Mexico where he helped restoring some famous pre-Columbian Mayan sites on the Yucatan peninsula, including the Chichen Itza and Uxmal pyramid complexes. Utzon himself called his experience in Mexico, “One of the greatest architectural experiences in my life”. He was fascinated by the way the Mayan’s built towards the sky to get closer to God.
In 1950 he retuned to Copenhagen and opened up his own architectural studio. During the early 1950’s Utzon was involved in several modest projects such as the Svaneke water tower on the island of Bornholm in 1952, multiple housing complexes, and his own home also in 1952. However, his career was about to take a sharp turn.
In 1955 a competition was launched for architects from around the world to submit their designs for what would become the Sydney Opera House. Architects from all over the world submitted their proposals. In all 233 designs from 32 countries were submitted, and many of them were done by the most famous architects of the day. In 1957 it was announced that Jørn Utzon’s design had been chosen. It was completely unexpected that a little known architect from the tiny country of Denmark would produce the winning design.
Oddly enough Utzon’s proposal had not been immediately accepted by the original panel in charge of picking the design; in fact his design had already been discarded. However, when the architect Eero Saarinen joined the panel (later than the other panel members) he was immediately impressed by Utzon’s daring design. He rescued Utzon’s design and set about opening the eyes of the other panel members so that they could see how spectacular Utzon’s design really was.
Jørn Utzon has said that his design was inspired by peeling an orange. There are 14 outer ‘shells’ in the design of the Sydney Opera House and if you were to assemble them they would form a perfect sphere. Utzon also wanted to create a building in which the façade is not same from all angles; something which he no doubt achieved.
Construction began in 1959 and was not complete until 1973. However Utzon left the project in 1966 after bitter arguments with Australian officials regarding cost and schedule issues. The construction of the Opera House was plagued with problems from the beginning since the technology did not exist to cast such large pieces of curved concrete. Utzon solved the problem prior to his departure from the project. Ironically Utzon left the project over disputes about costs of the project. When he left the project in 1966 the shells were almost complete and the total cost was only around $22.9 million Australian dollars. However, after Utzon left the project major changes to the original plans for the interiors were proposed. These changes finally drove the total cost up to $103 million Australian dollars. Unfortunately these changes resulted in many of his designs for the interiors to be discarded.
In 2007, the Sydney Opera House was added to the World Heritage List. Jørn Utzon is first person to still be alive while one of their works was added to the List.
Towards the end of his active career, he built the Church in Bagsværd (Bagsværd Kirke) in 1976 which he says was inspired by the clouds in Hawaii.
Some of his other well known projects include the Fredensborg Housing Estate (1959-62), the Kingo Housing Estate (1956-58), and the Skagen Nature Center (2001), all in Denmark. Jørn Utzon was the winner of the 2003 Pritzker Architecture Prize, which is often considered to be the architectural equivalent of the Nobel Prize. He is the only Danish architect to be awarded this prize.

Jørn Utzon was perhaps destined to design buildings that evoke the sea. Utzon's father was director of a shipyard in Alborg, Denmark, and was a brilliant naval architect. Several family members were excellent yachtsmen, and the young Jørn became a good sailor himself.
Until about the age of 18, Jørn Utzon considered a career as a naval officer. It was about this time, while still in secondary school, that he began helping his father at the shipyard, studying new designs, drawing up plans and making models. This activity opened another possibility — that of training to be a naval architect like his father.
However, during summer holidays with his grandparents Jørn Utzon met two artists, Paul Schrøder and Carl Kyberg, who introduced him to art. One of his father’s cousins, Einar Utzon-Frank, who happened to be a sculptor and was a professor at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, provided additional inspiration. Jørn Utzon took an interest in sculpting. At one point, he indicated he might want to be an artist, but was ultimately convinced that architectural school would be the best career path.
Even though his final marks in secondary school, particularly mathematics, were poor, his excellent freehand drawing talents were strong enough to win his admission to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. He was soon recognized as having extraordinary architectural gifts.
When Jørn Utzon graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in 1942, War War II had started. Utzon, like many architects of that time, fled to neutral Sweden. He worked in the Stockholm office of Hakon Ahlberg for the duration of World War II. Following that he went to Finland to work with Alvar Aalto . Jørn Utzon had begun to admire the ideas of Gunnar Asplund, as well as  Frank Lloyd Wright while still in school.
Jørn Utzon acknowledged that Aalto, Asplund, and Wright were all major influences. Over the next decade, Jørn Utzon traveled extensively, visiting Morocco, Mexico, the United States, China, Japan, India, and Australia, the latter destined to become a major factor in his life.
"As an architectonic element, the platform is fascinating. I lost my heart to it on a trip to Mexico in 1949, where I found a rich variety of both size and idea, and where many platforms stand alone, surrounded by nothing but untouched nature.
	"All the platforms in Mexico are placed very sensitively in the landscape, always the creations of a brilliant idea. They radiate a huge force. You feel the firm ground beneath you, as when standing on a great cliff. Let me give you an example of the power in this idea. Yucatan is a flat lowland area covered by an impenetrable jungle which everywhere attains a certain height.
"The Maya people used to live in this jungle in villages surrounded by small cultivated clearings. On all sides, and also above, there was the hot, humid, green jungle. No great views, no vertical movements. But by building up the platform on a level with the roof of the jungle, these people had suddenly conquered a new dimension that was a worthy place for the worship of their gods. They built their temples on these high platforms, which can be as much as a hundred metres long. From here, they had the sky, the clouds and the breeze, and suddenly the roof of the jungle was transformed into a great, open plain.
"By means of this architectonic device they had completely transformed the landscape and presented their eyes with a grandeur that corresponded to the grandeur of their gods. The wonderful experience of going from the denseness of the jungle to the vast openness above the platform is still there today.
"It is like the liberation you feel up here in the Nordic lands when, after weeks of rain, cloud and darkness, you suddenly emerge into the sunlight again."
