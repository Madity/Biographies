Michael Trent Reznor (born May 17, 1965) is an American singer-songwriter, composer, and record producer. As both a vocalist and multi-instrumentalist, Reznor has led the industrial rock project Nine Inch Nails since 1988; he left Interscope Records in 2007 and was an independent recording artist for around five years until he signed with Columbia Records. As of 2010, he and his wife Mariqueen Maandig are members of the post-industrial[5][6] group How to Destroy Angels with Reznor's fellow composer Atticus Ross and graphic designer Rob Sheridan.[5][7] Reznor and Ross scored the David Fincher films The Social Network and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, winning the Academy Award for Best Original Score for the former and the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media for the latter.
Reznor was previously associated with the bands Option 30, The Innocent, and Exotic Birds in the mid-80s. He gained employment at Right Track Studios in Cleveland and began creating his own music during the studio's closing hours under the name of Nine Inch Nails. Reznor's first release as Nine Inch Nails, the 1989 album Pretty Hate Machine, was a commercial and critical success and Reznor has since released eight major studio albums. Outside of Nine Inch Nails, he has contributed to the albums of artists such as Marilyn Manson and Saul Williams. In 1997, Reznor appeared in Time magazine's list of the year's most influential people and Spin magazine described him as "the most vital artist in music".[8]
Reznor was born in Mercer, Pennsylvania, halfway between Pittsburgh and Erie, the son of Nancy Lou (née Clark) and Michael Reznor.[9] After his parents divorced, he lived with his maternal grandparents, while his sister Tera lived with their mother.[10] Reznor is a descendant of George Reznor, who founded the Reznor Company, a heating and air conditioning manufacturing company, in 1888. The family sold the business in the 1960s.[9] He is of German and Irish ancestry.[11]
Reznor began playing the piano at the age of five and showed an early aptitude for music. In a 1995 interview, his grandfather, Bill Clark, remarked, "Music was his life, from the time he was a wee boy. He was so gifted."[12] His former piano teacher Rita Beglin said "Reznor always reminded me of Harry Connick, Jr." when he played.[12] Reznor has acknowledged that his sheltered life in Pennsylvania left him feeling isolated from the outside world. In a 1994 interview with Rolling Stone, he references his choices in the music industry.
I don't know why I want to do these things, other than my desire to escape from Small Town, U.S.A., to dismiss the boundaries, to explore. It isn't a bad place where I grew up, but there was nothing going on but the cornfields. My life experience came from watching movies, watching TV and reading books and looking at magazines. And when your fucking culture comes from watching TV every day, you're bombarded with images of things that seem cool, places that seem interesting, people who have jobs and careers and opportunities. None of that happened where I was. You're almost taught to realize it's not for you.
However, Reznor later said, "I don't want to give the impression it was a miserable childhood."[14] At Mercer Area Junior/Senior High School, Reznor learned to play the tenor saxophone and tuba. He was a member of both the jazz and marching band. Former Mercer High School band director Dr. Hendley Hoge remembered Reznor as "very upbeat and friendly".[12] Reznor also became involved in theater while in high school. He was voted "Best in Drama" by classmates for his roles as Judas in Jesus Christ Superstar and Professor Harold Hill in The Music Man. Reznor graduated in 1983 and enrolled at Allegheny College, where he studied computer engineering.[15]
While he was enrolled in Allegheny College, Reznor joined local band Option 30 and played three shows a week with them. After a year of college, Reznor dropped out and moved to Cleveland to pursue a career in music.[12] In 1985, he joined The Innocent as a keyboardist; they released one album, Livin' in the Street, but Reznor left the band after three months. In 1986, he joined local band Exotic Birds and appeared with them as a fictional band called The Problems in the 1987 film Light of Day. Reznor also contributed on keyboards to the band Slam Bamboo during this time.[16]
Reznor got a job at Cleveland's Right Track Studio as an assistant engineer and janitor.[17] Studio owner Bart Koster later commented, "He was so focused in everything he did. When that guy waxed the floor, it looked great."[12] Reznor asked Koster for permission to record demos of his own songs for free during unused studio time. Koster agreed, remarking that it cost him "just a little wear on his tape heads".[12] While assembling the earliest Nine Inch Nails recordings, Reznor was unable to find a band that could articulate his songs as he wanted. Instead, inspired by Prince, he played all the instruments except drums himself.[18] This role remains Reznor's on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians and assistants. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records.[17] Nine selections from the Right Track demos were unofficially released in 1988 as Purest Feeling and many of these songs appeared in revised form on Pretty Hate Machine, Reznor's first official release as Nine Inch Nails.
Most of Reznor's work as a musician has been as founding and primary member of Nine Inch Nails. Nine Inch Nails' debut album, Pretty Hate Machine was released in 1989. It was a moderate commercial success, and was certified Gold in 1992.[19] Amidst pressure from his record label to produce a follow-up to Pretty Hate Machine, Reznor secretly began recording under various pseudonyms to avoid record company interference, resulting in an EP called Broken (1992).[20] Nine Inch Nails was included in the Lollapalooza tour in the summer of 1991, and won a Grammy Award in 1993 under "Best Heavy Metal Performance" for the song "Wish".[21]
Nine Inch Nails' second full-length album, The Downward Spiral, entered the Billboard 200 chart in 1994 at number two,[22] and remains the highest-selling Nine Inch Nails release in America.[19] To record the album, Reznor rented and moved into the 10050 Cielo Drive mansion, where the 1969 Manson Family murders took place.[23] He built a studio space in the house, which he renamed Le Pig, after the word that was scrawled on the front door in Sharon Tate's blood by her murderers.[23] Reznor told Entertainment Weekly that, despite the notoriety attached to the house, he chose to record there because he "looked at a lot of places, and this just happened to be the one I liked most".[23]
Nine Inch Nails toured extensively over the next few years, including a performance at Woodstock '94, although he admitted to the audience that he did not like to play large venues.[24] Around this time, Reznor's studio perfectionism,[25] struggles with addiction, and bouts of writer's block prolonged the production of a follow-up to The Downward Spiral.[26] In 1999 the double album The Fragile was released. It was partially successful, but lost money for Reznor's label, so he funded the North American Fragility Tour out of his own pocket. A further six years followed before the next Nine Inch Nails album, With Teeth was released. During the intermediary period between the two records Reznor went into rehab, and was able to manage his drug addictions. After With Teeth Reznor released the album Year Zero, which is about how the current policies of the American government will affect the world in the year 2020. After Year Zero's release in 2007 Reznor broke from large record labels, and released two albums, The Slip and Ghosts I-IV independently on his own label, The Null Corporation. In 2009 Nine Inch Nails went on hiatus, following the Wave Goodbye Tour. In 2013 Nine Inch Nails returned to large record labels, signing with Columbia Records. In September the album Hesitation Marks was released, and earlier, in August, the ongoing Tension 2013 tour began.
One of Reznor's earliest collaborations was a Ministry side project in 1990 under the name of 1000 Homo DJs. Reznor sang vocals on a cover of Black Sabbath's "Supernaut". Due to legal issues with his label, Reznor's vocals had to be distorted to make his voice unrecognizable. The band also recorded additional versions with Al Jourgensen doing vocals.[27] While there is still debate as to which version is Reznor and which is Jourgensen, it has been definitively stated that Reznor's vocals were used in the TVT Records' Black Box box set.[28] Reznor sang backing vocals on "Past The Mission" by Tori Amos on her 1994 album Under the Pink. He produced Marilyn Manson's first album, Portrait of an American Family (1994), and several tracks on Manson's albums Smells Like Children (1995) and Antichrist Superstar (1996). He also produced the soundtracks for Oliver Stone's 1994 film Natural Born Killers and David Lynch's 1997 film Lost Highway. Reznor is credited for "Driver Down" and "Videodrones; Questions" on the Lost Highway soundtrack; another song, "The Perfect Drug", is credited to Nine Inch Nails. Reznor produced a remix of the Notorious B.I.G.'s song "Victory", featuring Busta Rhymes, in 1998.[29]
Under the stage name Tapeworm, Reznor collaborated for nearly 10 years with Danny Lohner, Maynard James Keenan, and Atticus Ross, but the project was eventually terminated before any official material was released.[30] The only known released Tapeworm material is a reworked version of a track called "Vacant" (retitled "Passive") on A Perfect Circle's 2004 album eMOTIVe,[31] as well as a track called "Potions" on Puscifer's 2009 album "C" Is for (Please Insert Sophomoric Genitalia Reference Here).
In 2006, Reznor played his first "solo" shows at Neil Young's annual Bridge School Benefit. Backed by a four piece string section, he performed stripped-down versions of many Nine Inch Nails songs.[32] Reznor featured on El-P's 2007 album I'll Sleep When You're Dead, providing guest vocals on the track "Flyentology". Reznor co-produced Saul Williams' 2007 album The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust! after Williams toured with Nine Inch Nails in 2005 and 2006. Reznor convinced Williams to release the album as a free download, while giving fans the option of paying $5 for higher quality files, or downloading all of the songs at a lower quality for free.[33][34] Reznor was also credited as "Musical Consultant" on the 2004 film Man on Fire.[35] The movie features six Nine Inch Nails songs.[36] He has produced a number of songs for Jane's Addiction in his home studio in Beverly Hills. The first recordings, new versions of the early tracks "Chip Away" and "Whores", were released simultaneously on Jane's Addiction's website and the NINJA 2009 Tour Sampler digital EP.
In November 2012, Reznor revealed on Reddit that he would be working with Queens of the Stone Age on a song for their sixth studio album, ...Like Clockwork.[37] He had worked with the band once before, providing backing vocals on the title track of the 2007 album Era Vulgaris. Josh Homme has since revealed that Reznor was originally meant to produce the album.
In January 2013, Reznor can be seen in a documentary entitled Sound City, directed by former Nirvana drummer and Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl in collaboration with writer Mark Monroe.[38] Sound City is based on real-life recording studio Sound City Studios, originating in Van Nuys, California. It has housed the works of some of the most famed names in music history since its founding in 1969. The film has been chosen as an official selection for the 2013 Sundance Film Festival and will be available to download from its official website on February 1, 2013.[39] Reznor also contributed to the soundtrack for the film, on the track "Mantra", along with Dave Grohl and Josh Homme.[40][41]
Reznor appeared in a live performance with Fleetwood Mac’s Lindsey Buckingham, Dave Grohl, and Queens Of The Stone Age at the January Grammy Award ceremony. In an interview with a New Zealand media outlet, Reznor explained his thought process at the time that he was considering his participation in the performance:
I spent a long time talking about the pros and cons. You know, ‘Do we want to be on a shit show on TV?' No, not really. 'Do we want to be affiliated with the Grammys?' No, not really. 'Would we like to reach a large audience and actually do something with integrity on our terms?' Well, yeah. Let’s roll the dice and go into it with the best intentions, with a performance we think is worthy and might—you know—stand out from the crowd. Or it might not![42]
In April 2010, it was announced that Reznor had formed a new band with his wife, Mariqueen Maandig, and Atticus Ross, called How to Destroy Angels. The group digitally released a self-titled six song EP on June 1, 2010, with the retail edition becoming available on July 6, 2010.[43] They covered the Bryan Ferry song "Is Your Love Strong Enough?"[44] for the soundtrack for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which was released on December 9, 2011. On September 21, 2012, Reznor announced that the group's next release would be an EP entitled An Omen EP, set for release on Columbia Records in November 2012, and that some of the EP's songs would later appear on the band's first full length album in 2013.[45][46] On October 8, 2012, they released a song and music video[47] from An Omen EP entitled "Keep it Together".[48] How to Destroy Angels announced in January 2013 that their first full-length album entitled Welcome Oblivion would be released on March 5 of the same year.[49]
In May 2008 Reznor founded The Null Corporation and Nine Inch Nails released the studio album The Slip as a free digital download. In his appreciation for his following and fan base, and having no contractual obligation, he made "The Slip" available for free on his website, stating “This one’s on me.”[50] A month and a half after its online release, The Slip had been downloaded 1.4 million times from the official Nine Inch Nails website.[51]
In February 2009, Reznor posted his thoughts about the future of Nine Inch Nails on NIN.com, stating that "I've been thinking for some time now it's time to make NIN disappear for a while."[52] Reznor noted in an interview on the official website that while he has not stopped creating music as Nine Inch Nails, the group will not be touring in the foreseeable future.[53][54]
The original music from id Software's 1996 video game Quake is credited to "Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails";[55] Reznor helped record sound effects and ambient audio, and the NIN logo appears on the nailgun ammunition boxes in the game.[56] Reznor's association with id Software began with Reznor being a fan of the original Doom. He reunited with id Software in 2003 as the sound engineer for Doom 3, though due to "time, money and bad management",[57] he had to abandon the project, and his audio work did not make it into the game's final release.
Nine Inch Nails' 2007 major studio recording, Year Zero, was released alongside an accompanying alternate reality game.[58] With its lyrics written from the perspective of multiple fictitious characters, Reznor described Year Zero as a concept album criticizing the United States government's current policies and how they will affect the world 15 years in the future.[59] In July 2012, it was announced that Reznor had composed and performed the theme song for Call of Duty: Black Ops II.[60]
In 2001, Reznor was asked by Mark Romanek to provide the score for One Hour Photo, but the music did not work for the film and was not used. These compositions eventually evolved into Still.[61] A remix of the Nine Inch Nails track "You Know What You Are?" by Clint Mansell was used as part of the latter's soundtrack to the 2005 film adaptation of Doom. In 2009, Trent Reznor composed "Theme for Tetsuo" for the Japanese cyberpunk film Tetsuo: The Bullet Man from Shinya Tsukamoto.[62]
Reznor collaborated with Atticus Ross to compose the score for David Fincher's The Social Network, a 2010 drama film about the founding of Facebook. Says Reznor, "When I actually read the script and realized what he was up to, I said goodbye to that free time I had planned."[63] The score was noted for portraying "Mark Zuckerberg the genius, developing a brilliant idea over ominous undertones,"[64] and received nearly unanimous praise across the board. The film's score was released in October 2010 in multiple formats, including digital download, compact disc, 5.1 surround on Blu-ray disc, and vinyl record.[65] A 5-song sampler EP was released for free via digital download.[66] In 2011 Reznor and Ross won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score[67] and the Academy Award for Original Score[68] for this work.
On January 7, 2011, Reznor announced that he would again be working with Fincher, this time to provide the score for the American adaptation of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.[69] A cover of "Immigrant Song" by Led Zeppelin produced by Reznor and Ross, with Karen O (of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs) as featured singer, was released by way of a trailer for the film. The cover extended for the entirety of the trailer and was well received by critics.[70] Reznor and Ross were nominated for the 2012 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and won the 2013 Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media for their score.
On January 21, 2014, it was announced that Reznor and Ross would once again be collaborating to score Fincher's film Gone Girl.[71]
In 2004, Reznor's former manager John Malm Jr. filed suit in the United States district court of Ohio against Reznor for over $2 million in deferred commissions. The suit alleged that Reznor "reneged on every single contract he and Malm ever entered into", and that Reznor refused to pay Malm payments to which he was contractually entitled.[72] Weeks later, Reznor filed a counter-suit in the U.S. District Court of New York, charging Malm with fraud and breach of fiduciary duties.[73] Reznor's suit arose from a five-year management contract signed in the early days of Nine Inch Nails, between Reznor and Malm's management company J. Artist Management. This contract, according to the suit, was unlawful and immoral in that it secured Malm 20% of Reznor's gross earnings, rather than his net earnings, as is the standard practice between artists and their management. The suit also alleged that the contract secured this percentage even if Malm was no longer representing Reznor, and for all Reznor's album advances.[74] The suit also described how Malm had misappropriated the ownership rights regarding Nine Inch Nails, including the trademark name "NIN".[75] According to testimony by Malm, Reznor gave him half of the "NIN" trademark "as a gift."[75]
Reznor stated that he began to fully understand his financial situation after tackling his addiction to drugs and alcohol.[74] Reznor requested a financial statement from Malm in 2003, only to discover that he had only $400,000 in liquid assets. "It was not pleasant discovering you have a 10th as much as you've been told you have," Reznor told the court.[76] Malm's lawyers, however, claimed that Malm had worked for years "pro bono", and that Reznor's inability to release an album or tour and his uninhibited spending were the reasons for Reznor's financial situation.[77]
After a three-week trial in 2005, jurors sided with Reznor, awarding him upwards of $2.95 million and returning to him complete control of his trademarks.[76] After adjustment for inflation, Reznor's award rose to nearly $5 million.[75]
In January 2013, Trent Reznor, along with TopSpin Media founder Ian Rogers, were chosen to head Beats Electronics' new music subscription service, "Project Daisy", described by Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine as having "hardware, brand, distribution partnerships, and artist relations to differentiate Daisy from the competition."[78] The launch date for the Daisy service is slated for summer of 2013. There is some speculation as to what Reznor's role would be within the company, but he promises that he and the other members of "Daisy" strive to create a music subscription service that will be like "having your own guy when you go to the record store, who knows what you like but can also point you down some paths you wouldn't have necessarily encountered."[79] Beats Electronics announced that their music service will be launched in late 2013, after getting $60 million in funding from investors.[80][81] The service was officially unveiled in January 2014 as Beats Music, for a launch in the United States on January 21, 2014.[82]
Following the release of Year Zero, Reznor announced later that Nine Inch Nails had split from its contractual obligations with Interscope Records, and would distribute its next major albums independently. The last Nine Inch Nails release on Interscope was Year Zero Remixed, based on material from Year Zero.[83]
In May 2007, Reznor made a post on the official Nine Inch Nails website condemning Universal Music Group—the parent company of the band's record label, Interscope Records—for their pricing and distribution plans for Nine Inch Nails' 2007 album Year Zero.[84] He labeled the company's retail pricing of Year Zero in Australia as "ABSURD," concluding that "as a reward for being a 'true fan' you get ripped off". Reznor went on to say that as "the climate grows more and more desperate for record labels, their answer to their mostly self-inflicted wounds seems to be to screw the consumer over even more."[85] Reznor's post, specifically his criticism of the recording industry at large, elicited considerable media attention.[86] In September 2007, Reznor continued his attack on Universal Music Group at a concert in Australia, urging fans there to "steal" his music online instead of purchasing it legally.[87] Reznor went on to encourage the crowd to "steal and steal and steal some more and give it to all your friends and keep on stealin'."[88]
While on tour in Prague in 2009, Reznor realized the importance of the marketing aspect of a major label when he saw a lot of promotion for Radiohead's then-upcoming tour, but little promotion for his current Nine Inch Nails tour or any of its recently released albums. Reznor said the marketing from a major label outweighed the aspects of being independent that he liked, namely the ability to release albums whenever he wanted to avoid leaking, and to take a larger cut of the profits from record sales.[89] Reznor's first album released through a major label after his return was How to Destroy Angels' An Omen EP released in November 2012 through Columbia Records. On working with Columbia for the release of the EP, Reznor said that "so far it's been pleasantly pleasant".[89]
In 2013, Reznor returned to Columbia Records for Hesitation Marks, the eighth Nine Inch Nails studio album. He will return to Interscope in 2014 for a Nine Inch Nails greatest hits compilation featuring two brand new songs.[90]
Reznor possesses a baritone vocal range.[91] He is a fan of David Bowie, and has cited Bowie's 1977 album Low as one of his favorite albums. Reznor has stated that he played the album constantly during the recording of The Downward Spiral for inspiration.[14] In 1995, Nine Inch Nails toured as a co-headlining act on the North American leg of David Bowie's Outside Tour. Reznor also appeared in Bowie's video for "I'm Afraid of Americans", cast as Bowie's stalker. Reznor also made several remixes for the single release of the same song, as well as a remix of "The Hearts Filthy Lesson".[92] Reznor also states in the 2010 documentary Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage that the band Rush had played a major part in his childhood influences. He also stated that he considered Rush to be "one of the best bands ever" and had gained a perspective on how keyboards could be introduced into hard rock after listening to their 1982 album Signals. Reznor also stated "Freddie Mercury's death meant more to me than John Lennon's" and covered Queen's "Get Down Make Love", which was produced by Paul Barker & Al Jourgensen of Ministry and released on the single for "Sin". Nine Inch Nails front-man Trent Reznor also expressed the significant influence that Coil had on his work in February 2014:[39], saying that Horse Rotorvator was deeply influential (Harry Sword (27 February 2014). "Trent Reznor On Coil & Nine Inch Nails, Plus Recoiled Review". The Quietus. The Quietus. Retrieved 28 February 2014). In many interviews in Musician, Spin, and Alternative Press, Reznor mentioned Devo, The Cars, The Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, Pere Ubu, Soft Cell,[93] Prince, Ministry,[94] Gary Numan, and The Cure's 1985 album, The Head on the Door, as important influences.[95] In a radio interview, Reznor stated the first song he ever wrote "Down in It" was a "total rip-off" of the Skinny Puppy song "Dig It."[96]
Reznor's work as Nine Inch Nails has influenced many newer artists, which according to Reznor range from "generic imitations" dating from the band's initial success to younger bands echoing his style in a "truer, less imitative way".[97] Following the release of The Downward Spiral, mainstream artists began to take notice of Nine Inch Nails' influence: David Bowie compared NIN's impact to that of The Velvet Underground.[98] In 1997, Reznor appeared in Time magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and Spin magazine described him as "the most vital artist in music."[8] Bob Ezrin, producer for Pink Floyd, Kiss, Alice Cooper, and Peter Gabriel, described Reznor in 2007 as a "true visionary" and advised aspiring artists to take note of his no-compromise attitude.[99] During a rare appearance at the Kerrang! Awards in London that year, Reznor accepted the Kerrang! Icon, honoring Nine Inch Nails' long-standing influence on rock music.[100] Steven Wilson of progressive rock band Porcupine Tree has stated that he much admires Reznor's production work, in particular The Fragile. Timbaland, one of pop music's most successful producers in recent years, has cited Reznor as his favorite studio producer.[101]
During the five years following the release of The Downward Spiral, Reznor struggled with depression, social anxiety disorder, and the death of his grandmother (who raised him). During this period of intense grief, Reznor began abusing alcohol, cocaine, and other drugs. He eventually became addicted to alcohol and cocaine. Reznor reached his darkest moment with substance abuse while touring in London for The Fragile, when he mistakenly purchased china white heroin, which he believed to be cocaine; he consequently overdosed and was resuscitated at a local hospital.[102]
In 2001, Reznor successfully completed rehab, and eventually moved from New Orleans to Los Angeles. In a 2005 interview with Kerrang, Reznor reflected on his self-destructive past: "There was a persona that had run its course. I needed to get my priorities straight, my head screwed on. Instead of always working, I took a couple of years off, just to figure out who I was and working out if I wanted to keep doing this or not. I had become a terrible addict; I needed to get my shit together, figure out what had happened".[26] In contrast to his former suicidal tendencies, Reznor also admitted in another interview that he is "pretty happy".[103] Nine Inch Nails' next full-length album, With Teeth (2005), reached number one on the Billboard 200.[104][105]
Reznor married Mariqueen Maandig in October 2009.[106] Their first son, Lazarus Echo, was born on October 10, 2010,[107] and their second son, Balthazar,[108] was born on December 31, 2011.[109]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Trent Reznor is an American songwriter/musician/producer and sole member of multi-platinum act Nine Inch Nails, and now an Academy Award winning film composer. He began creating music as a child in Western Pennsylvania, first on piano and then taking up other instruments. He eventually moved to Cleveland, OH where he took a job at a local recording studio as an assistant engineer/janitor, recording his own material during unused studio time.Those recordings became the first Nine Inch Nails album, 1989's Pretty Hate Machine. NIN soon developed a reputation as one of the best live acts in rock and joined the inaugural Lollapalooza tour in 1991. The Broken EP followed in 1992, garnering NIN's first Grammy Award (NIN has received twelve Grammy nominations and won two awards). In 1994, the breakthrough album The Downward Spiral was released and featured the radio hits "Closer" and "Hurt." The controversial music video for "Closer" was directed by Mark Romanek and is considered among the best music videos of all time having won various awards (it is one of the few music videos included in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City). NIN's mud-covered appearance that Summer at Woodstock 1994 is now legendary. Also released that year was the Reznor produced soundtrack to Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers. He returned to film 3 years later, producing the soundtrack for David Lynch's Lost Highway. In 1997, Reznor appeared on Time magazine's most influential people list, and Spin magazine named him "the most vital artist in music."Five years later NIN's next album, The Fragile, was released - the double album debuted at number one. In 2002, "Hurt" was covered by Johnny Cash to critical acclaim; it was one of Cash's final hit releases before his death. NIN's next album, With Teeth, also reached number one in 2005 as did the single "The Hand That Feeds." Reznor broke new ground by posting the single's source tracks as a free download for fans to edit/remix/sample as they pleased and creating an online community for fans to share their creations. David Fincher directed the video for "Only," With Teeth's second single.The concept album Year Zero was released in 2007 alongside an accompanying ARG (alternate reality game). Conceived by Trent Reznor and assisted in execution by 42 Entertainment, the ARG progressed through the album release and beyond, featuring no less than 29 websites, hidden messages within NIN merchandise, recordings and barcodes, hotlines, flier and poster campaigns, and even resistance cell "meetings" organized via calls made to pre-paid cell phones distributed to participants. Within two months, the ARG amassed 2.5 million cumulative site visits, 7.5 million cumulative page views and 2 million phone calls. Reznor has developed Year Zero into an HBO/BBC mini-series, currently in pre-production.In 2008, free of contractual obligations, NIN released Ghosts I-IV, a 36-track instrumental album, NIN's first independent release. Soon after, a new studio album, The Slip, was released as a free digital download alongside a simple message: "Thank you for your continued and loyal support over the years - this one's on me" - TR (In less than a year, it exceeded 1.8M downloads). Ghosts I-IV and The Slip were both released under Creative Commons licenses allowing extensive use of the material within independent film projects. Following these two releases, NIN embarked on the acclaimed Lights In The Sky Tour featuring groundbreaking production effects, layering and programming that allowed the performers to interact and control aspects of the show's visuals. The tour was recognized by the industry as one of the top-ten most creative tours of all time.Over the course of his career, Reznor has also collected countless production and remix credits including collaborations with David Bowie, producing Saul Williams and the discovery and production of Marilyn Manson.In 2010, Reznor composed his first film score; for David Fincher's masterwork The Social Network. The score won the Academy Award for best score and the Golden Globe Award for best original score. Additionally, he received a Critics' Choice Movie Award and a Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for best score. He is currently working on scoring Fincher's next film, the highly anticipated The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (due for a Christmas 2011 release).In addition to his continued work in Nine Inch Nails, Reznor is recording new music as a member of the group How To Destroy Angels.
      Headed up 'nothing records', a division of 'Interscope Records', from 1992 to 2007. After legal issues with Interscope, resulting in Reznor leaving the label, 'nothing records' was shut down and declared extinct. The 2007 Nine Inch Nails album, Year Zero, was the first release since 1992 to not carry the 'nothing' logo.
      Converted an old funeral parlor in New Orleans into a recording studio. The door to the studio was salvaged from the former rented "love house" of Sharon Tate (one of seven of the victims of Charles Manson and his "family").
      Played in bands such as Option 30, Prick and Exotic Birds (which did music for the Michael J. Fox movie, "Light Of Day".
      Had a side-project called Tapeworm from 1995-2004. In 1995 Reznor started the project with Nine Inch Nails live-band members Danny Lohner and Charlie Clouser. Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan and Atticus Ross later joined the project. Tapeworm ended in 2004 due to label issues and other project obligations by Reznor and Keenan. Music from the side-project has never been released.
      At his high school he played the role of Judas in a school performance of Jesus Christ Superstar.
      Dropped out of College to spend his time with local bands, not doing much more than playing keyboards and occasionally doing background vocals.
      Played prominent roles in his high school's productions of Jesus Christ SuperStar and The Music Man, as Judas and Professor Harold Hill respectively. He was voted "best in Drama" by his classmates.
      Is good friends with fellow recording artist, Tori Amos. He sang background vocals on her hit song, "Past The Mission"
      His musical influences are David Bowie, The Cure, Nick Drake, Brian Eno, Kraftwerk, Joy Division, Jim Morrison, Pink Floyd, Lou Reed, Talking Heads, Throbbing Gristle and Tom Waits.
      He enjoys listening to Tori Amos, Aphex Twin, Dead Can Dance, The Flaming Lips, Jane's Addiction, Ministry, Portishead, Radiohead, Rammstein, Skinny Puppy, The Smashing Pumpkins and Tool
      Nine Inch Nails were voted the 44th Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Artists of all time by Rolling Stone.
      Brought in bassist/long time friend Jordie White (aka Twiggy Ramirez) to tour in support of the album 'With Teeth.'
      He is a direct descendant of George Reznor, founder of Reznor Company in 1888 (a major manufacturer of Heating/Ventilation/Air Conditioning equipment). The Reznor Company was sold in the 1960s, but the equipment is still manufactured in Mercer, Pennsylvania (Trent Reznor's home town).
      Prior to the release of the 2007 NIN album Year Zero, several tracks were leaked through various music download websites. Reznor later admitted that he intentionally leaked the tracks himself as part of a "conspiracy" ad campaign to go along with the subject matter of the album.
      His musical work heavily inspired Maquinista, El (2004) (The Machinist). Christian Bale's character is named Trevor Reznik, a clear play on Reznor's own name; the N in Machinist was often seen in promotional posters printed backwards akin to the infamous Nine Inch Nails logo; and originally the soundtrack was meant to include a lot of NIN's material but was deemed too 'cheesy' due to the overall industrial feel and setting of the film as it was.
      On July 4, 1992, he rented the infamous Benedict Canyon house located at 10050 Cielo Drive, in which members of Charles Manson's "Family" murdered Sharon Tate and four others in 1969, to record his album "The Downward Spiral". He moved out not long after, stating, "there was too much history in that house for me to handle".
      In May of 2009 publicly announced his wedding engagement to Mariqueen Maandig, a one-time Playboy model and lead singer for underground rock band "West Indian Girl". In October 2010 the couple welcomed their first child, Lazarus Echo Reznor.
      Played at a benefit concert for New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Reznor lived in New Orleans for many years before relocating to Los Angeles in 2004. His longtime recording studio, Nothing Records, was located at 4500 Magazine Street in New Orleans.
      Reznor is part of the band How to Destroy Angels alongside Atticus Ross and his wife, Mariqueen Maandig. The band released a 6-track EP in early 2010 and were featured on the soundtrack for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), the same soundtrack in which Reznor and Ross composed.
      Reznor officially broke apart from his longtime record affiliation, Interscope Records, in 2007 and has since been an independent musician. Since leaving Interscope he created his own label, The Null Corporation, in which all future Nine Inch Nails releases are to be released under. The film scores for The Social Network (2010) and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) and his side-project, How to Destroy Angels, are also under The Null Corporation.
      In April 2008, Reznor unexpectedly released the Nine Inch Nails album, The Slip, under a Creative Commons license allowing fans to download it through the band's website for free. He released a statement with the album's release stating, "this one's on me." The album was downloaded over 2 million times and peaked at #13 on the Billboard 200 chart.
      Reznor and Atticus Ross release free samplers of their film scores before the official release. A 5-track sampler was posted for The Social Network (2010) eleven days prior to the full release and a 6-track sampler was posted for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) seven days prior to the full release.

      It's like beating your head open and unzipping your chest cavity saying 'here are my guts - everything I've felt, including a lot of stuff I'm not proud of'. It's hard. It uses you up. I walk off stage sometimes and feel like I've just slept with everybody in the audience. - on performing
      I thought my goal in life was to be in a successful band, and I had got that, but I was as miserable as I had ever been, and I couldn't understand why that would be.
      I wanted to escape Small Town USA. To dismiss the boundaries, to explore. My life experience came from watching movies, TV, and reading books and magazines. When your culture comes from watching TV everyday, you're bombarded with images of things that seem cool, places that seem interesting, people who have jobs and careers and opportunities. None of that happened where I was. You're almost taught to realize it's not for you.
      My dad and I are best friends. He's pretty much responsible for the way I turned out. He would provide a little artistic inspiration here and there in the form of a guitar, stuff like that.
      I foolishly thought that if I just 'made it' then everything would be okay. And everything wasn't okay.
      If you look at the most talented filmmakers around right now, David Cronenberg and David Lynch, they had relatively normal upbringings. It doesn't always take exotic, bizarre lifestyles, early-age molestations and prison sentences.
      When I was five, I got forced into taking piano lessons. And it came really naturally to me. Knowing that I was good at something played an important role in my confidence. I was always shy, uncomfortable around people. I slipped by. But with the music, I didn't. I got into bands. I studied trumpet and saxaphone a little bit. It got to the point where my teacher was like, you can be a concert pianist. But the last thing I wanted to hear at 15 is, well, you're not fitting in now, how about dropping out of school, studying all the time and becoming a concert pianist? It sounds like "penis." Even earlier, Kiss had changed my world. It seemed evil and scary-the embodiment of rebelliousness when you're age 12 and starting to get hair on your balls. Also, my dad, who I'd not lived with since I was 5, got me an electric piano. He had a little music store that sold acoustic instruments in the back room, where me and a couple other guys started jamming in terrible garage bands. I realized that music wasn't all about learning a piece on the piano.
      The idea of politics is just so uninteresting to me - I've never paid much attention to it. I don't believe things can really change. It doesn't matter who's president. Nothing really gets resolved. I don't know. I guess that's not the right attitude to take.
      My music has been a sort of personal therapy. It's got me out of tough times, it has been the friend that I needed, when I didn't have a friend there.
      There are just some things that don't seem very fair in the world, like the hypocrisy of organized religion. I just don't understand how people can blindly believe a bunch of the lies they're fed, to believe it so that they don't think too hard about other issues. 'Be a good boy and you'll go to Heaven.' If it works for you, fine, but it doesn't work for me.
      An integral part of any relationship is knowing that you could be killed in your sleep at any time.
      I don't know if you have ever tried to think of band names, but usually you think you have a great one and you look at it the next day and it's stupid. I had about two hundred of those. Nine Inch Nails stood the two week test, looked great in print and could be abbreviated easily. It really does not have a literal meaning. It seemed kinda frightening. It's a curse trying to come up with band names.
      I would much rather sit in a room by myself than entertain a bunch of people. That's not my style.
      I become irritated when I am being written off as aloof or stand-offish when I'm shy and don't know what to say.
      I was raised by my grandparents, the greatest people in the world. I try to tell them, 'You're not going to hear my music on the radio. I'm not going to be on soap operas singing this.' I can imagine what my grandfather tells people: 'It's called Nine Inch Nails -- here's the video. And here he is lying dead at the end of it.' I warned my grandfather that the church might be after him.
      I cut my hair now and nobody recognizes me. It's that whole thing I was bitching about earlier - 'I can't go anywhere without someone pointing' - And now it's like, 'Hey, it's me man!' I'm standing in the N section with my laminate on and covered in mud. I just can't get a response anymore.
      I think, fundamentally, music is something people love and need and can relate to. A lot of what's out right now feels like McDonalds. It's quick-fix. You kind of have a stomach ache afterwards.
      When Nine Inch Nails first got signed, I didn't know how to do interviews. I really still don't. I talk too much and say stupid things.
      I pop the video in, and wow. Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps...Wow. I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore...It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom as a way of staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. That winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning. Different, but every bit as pure. - on his emotions upon watching the video of Johnny Cash's cover of his song "Hurt"
      [on living in the house at 10050 Cielo Drive, where 5 people were murdered in 1969 by Charles Manson's "Family"]: While I was working on Downward Spiral, I was living in the house where Sharon Tate was killed. Then one day I met her sister. It was a random thing, just a brief encounter. And she said: 'Are you exploiting my sister's death by living in her house?' For the first time, the whole thing kind of slapped me in the face. I said, 'No, it's just sort of my own interest in American folklore. I'm in this place where a weird part of history occurred.' I guess it never really struck me before, but it did then. She lost her sister from a senseless, ignorant situation that I don't want to support. When she was talking to me, I realized for the first time, 'What if it was my sister?' I thought, 'Fuck Charlie Manson.' I went home and cried that night. It made me see there's another side to things, you know?
      [on covering Led Zeppelin for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)] That took a hell of a lot of time to do that. And also from the position of, "Hey, do you want to cover a classic rock song?" You're kind of setting yourself up to fail. A lot of time spent revising that and trying to get the tone just right. Again, when he [David Fincher] brought up the idea of doing it, he fully didn't explain the context of what it would be used for, so there was a bit of head scratching on our part. Immigrant Song? With Karen O.? We'll try it, we'll see. We know we could sabotage it; it could end up sucking. But we ended up with something, surprisingly, I'm quite proud of.
      [on being nominated for Best Original Score a second time] With The Social Network (2010), everything was quite a surprise because nobody -- well, Atticus (Ross) and myself -- when we were asked to work on the film it never crossed our minds that there would be an awards season, that we'd ever be up for anything. That's not because we didn't think we did good work. Not coming from the film world we never thought of it. So that whole unraveling, the revealing of the momentum of the film of lots of people liking it, leading up to the nominations was quite flattering. To be quite honest with you, to work in a new discipline to have your peers say "Hey, that didn't suck."
      [on winning an Academy Award] You think, "I'm probably not going to win, but if I do win, I'd better not sound like an idiot." The anxiety builds. Then you realize you haven't eaten in 12 hours. And the camera's on you, maybe, at all times. "I need to pick my nose, but I can't risk it." Then you hear your name in slow motion. "OK, hug my wife. Don't trip over the cord. Why am I taking steps two at a time? I'm going to slip, but I can't stop. Oh my God there's Nicole Kidman, she's nine feet tall. Is the mic on?" It's over in a millisecond and you're backstage with an Oscar in your hand.
      [accepting an Academy Award for Best Original Score] Wow, is this really happening? When we finished work on The Social Network (2010) we were very proud of our work and happy to just be involved in this film. And to be standing up here in this company is humbling and flattering beyond words. I'd like to especially thank the Academy for recognizing our work here and David Fincher. David Fincher, thank you so much for the opportunity. I'd also like to thank my wonderful wife, Mariqueen, I love you so much.

The Stain of Time is the unorthodox biography of American rock musican Trent Reznor, one of the most influential and innovative men in the music industry today. Expanding the boundaries usually associated with biographical works, author Remanon Last argues that it is possible that bleedthrough from a past life has been the catalyst not only for Reznor's critically acclaimed career but also for his often troubled personal life. The author, aided by the daimon Sigmund, compares a compelling story from the past to Reznor's life today. For those sceptical of the past life/reincarnation theory there is also a chapter that offers some scientific proof for a soul that survives death.

       The Stain of Time is an unorthodox biography and, we believe, the first of its kind. For fans wondering what makes the man behind Nine Inch Nails tick, this book is compelling reading.
       100500 Cielo Drive. Trent Reznor has fervently denied selecting this California residence based on its infamous past. Affording exquiste views over the Hollywood Hills and its suitability for recording in are the reasons he gives for singling it out over nine other properties he viewed. Trent claims he wasn't aware, until after the lease was signed, that it was the house in which Sharon Tate and four of her friends were brutally murdered by the Manson family. Alerted by the housekeeper on a sultry morning in 1969, police arrived to find the heavily pregnant Tate with a rope around her neck, dead from multiple stab wounds. Attached to the opposite end of the rope, drenched in blood, was prominent Hollywood hairstylist Jay Sebring. Scrawled across the walls in their blood were the words 'Pigs' and ' Helter Skelter': a reference to a track off the Beatles White album, a record which was belived by Charles Manson to contain coded messages urging him and his Family to provoke a race war. Unparalleled in their savagery, it was intended that the murders should be blamed on the black nationalist party The Black Panthers.  The house has since been razed but Reznor, not entirely willing to leave the past behind, took the front door with him. It is now ensconced at his New Orleans recording studio.

  Usually, I enjoy reading biographies of people who have struck me with their art, however this book seems to use the excuse of being a Trent Reznor biography to delve into supernatural and pseudo-spiritual issues. This book fails on both fronts, it is neither a comprehensive discussion of Trent Reznor's life and nor a credible account of supernatural justifications for everyday happenings. It is clear that the author's main goal was not to present chronicled information on Trent's life but rather to promote his ideas of mysticism and spirituality. In using the excuse of a Trent Reznor biography he has managed to deceptively lure people into reading what is otherwise waffle. Biography used as a marketing ploy.
  As a huge fan of Trent Reznor I couldn't wait to add this to my NIN collection. However I was really pleased by the way this biography covered the subject matter. I have two other Reznor biographies and they seemed to me to be cut and pastes from magazine articles (that I had already read). The way the author introduces the possibility of a past life as having an influence over Reznor's work is an interesting concept, and although I'm not necessarily a believer in reincarnation it was presented in a factual way that was not intrusive to the rest of the biography. I would recommend this book to both Nine Inch Nails fans and particularly to those with an interest in the occult.
  I LOVE Trent and NIN and was so excited after reading Long Hard Road Out Of Hell to find out there was a book that might be just as good by my fav artist. I was not impressed at all. All the side stories of demons was really confusing and hard to grasp where Trent was comming from? To be honest I wanted a raw and honest autobigraphy written by Trent or someone very close to him and this was not it!
  This book is awful. Its rambling & pointless & the grammar sucks as well.Wether your a fan of Trents or the occult don't waste your hard earned cash on this pile of poop.

=======================================================
Michael Trent Reznor (born May 17, 1965, in Mercer, Pennsylvania) is the founder and mastermind behind Nine Inch Nails.
Reznor was born and raised in the western Pennsylvania town of Mercer in a Lutheran household (although Reznor now states that he believes in God, but has no actual religion). Because he has the same first name as his father, he was called by his middle name to avoid confusion. In late 1970, soon after the birth of his little sister, Reznor's father left and his parents divorced. He and his infant sister were sent to live with their maternal grandparents, primarily because it would have been too difficult for their mother to raise them by herself. Reznor's grandmother decided that the 5-year-old should take classical piano lessons. Over the years he became immersed in music and has been compared to Harry Connick, Jr. by his piano teacher.
By the time Reznor was in high school he discovered horror movies and rock music. KISS and David Bowie were his heroes. His grandmother considered pulling him out of school so that he could focus on his piano studies full-time, with the hope that he would become a classical pianist. Reznor did not want this and instead became active in Mercer High School's Marching Band, Concert Band, and in theater. He played tenor saxophone and tuba in the school bands, even winning Top Woodwind at one point. He also played Judas in the school's production of Jesus Christ Superstar and landed the title role in The Music Man.
Reznor graduated from high school in 1983 and went on to study production at Allegheny College. It was around this time that he joined his first "real" band, Option 30. They became popular in the college scene in western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio but Reznor clearly wanted to get out and see more. After a year in college, Reznor dropped out of school and left Option 30, moving to Cleveland. Once there, he worked a few odd jobs, selling music instruments and also working as a studio technician at Right Track Studio. It was in Cleveland that he met roommate and future bandmate Chris Vrenna. The day jobs helped Reznor pay the bills but, like in Pennsylvania, he became active in Cleveland's music scene.
Reznor's first band in Cleveland was a cover band called The Urge. This band drew crowds and Reznor got some recognition. When he left the band months later they lost much of their audience. Reznor briefly re-joined before parting ways again shortly thereafter. In 1985, he joined The Innocent as a keyboardist, but left the band after three months. In 1986, he joined the Exotic Birds as a keyboardist and back-up vocalist with Andy Kubiszewski (who would later join Stabbing Westward) and, at one point, Vrenna. The Exotic Birds received some national attention after playing a few gigs with the Culture Club, but Reznor's tenure with them would not last. This was followed by keyboardist positions in Slam Bamboo and Lucky Pierre. But all the while, Reznor wanted to be able to do his own music and be his own musician.
In 1988, Reznor was finally able to write his first "real" song. It was entitled "Down In It" and was recorded as part of a demo during Reznor's spare time at the studio. After trying to come up with a name for his solo project (an early contender was The Crown Of Thorns[1]), he settled on the name Nine Inch Nails (NIN for short) because "it sounded menacing, it was catchy, it stood the two-week test, and it could be easily abbreviated." He later befriended John A. Malm, Jr., who would become his manager for 15 years. The demo (known as Purest Feeling) was shopped around to various record labels. Ultimately TVT Records, known for its TV music compilations, signed Reznor and offered to help him release his music.
Reznor reworked many of the demos he recorded and even added some new material to his debut album, entitled Pretty Hate Machine. After its recording he assembled a small live band, inviting Vrenna to join him as one of his bandmates. This band played some small shows in Cleveland and was eventually invited on the road by Skinny Puppy. The band would eventually be invited to join the first Lollapalooza tour, where they became one of the most popular bands on the tour.
By the time 1991 rolled around, Reznor was in a miserable state. The label was pressuring him to record more material but was trying to tell him which producers to use and how the material should sound. Reznor wanted out of his contract and secretly recorded an EP in various locations around the world. The EP, titled Broken, was released in 1992 and explained the situation to its buyers. The EP was released by Nothing Records, which Reznor and Malm established to help him get out of his contract. Eventually TVT settled with Reznor, allowing him the creative freedom he wanted, but they would distribute future releases.
It was during this time that Reznor was in the process of recording the second NIN album, The Downward Spiral. It was recorded in a Beverly Hills mansion-turned-studio dubbed "Le Pig" that would later be revealed to be the house where actress Sharon Tate and others were murdered by followers of cult leader Charles Manson. Reznor had also befriended a Florida-based shock-rock band, Marilyn Manson, who would sign to Nothing Records.
The Downward Spiral was released in March of 1994 and had a significantly different sound. Reznor was much more experimental, creating soundscapes and improvising in the studio rather than having something written beforehand. It was touted as a concept album, describing someone throwing away everything in his life in hopes of finding some sense of peace. The album was a personal and commercial success, but with the increasing exposure, Reznor's personal problems began to multiply. He found himself turning to drugs and alcohol often as an escape from the pressure put on him by the media, the label, and even himself. The extensive touring behind the album didn't help his problems, either.
It would be the mud-soaked Woodstock '94 performance that would thrust Reznor into the national consciousness. Broadcast on Pay-Per-View, the visceral performance would make Reznor a superstar among the many bands and musicians who were active at the time. However, the sudden national fame and recognition only accelerated Reznor's increasing problems.
By the end of the touring cycle (known as the Self-Destruct tour), Reznor was miserable. He had sunk into addiction, and pressure from the label to begin work on a follow-up to The Downward Spiral took its toll. He stepped back for a little while and took time to sort things out.
The time between the end of the Self-Destruct tour and the release of The Fragile was one of reflection and realization for Reznor. He checked into a Florida rehabilitation center to deal with the drug and alcohol problems that plagued him throughout the last tour. Shortly after completing the program, he received word that his maternal grandmother had died. Reznor was completely devastated by this news and went into counselling to help him deal with his loss. Through this event he managed to write a song that conveyed his emotions and thoughts ("I'm Looking Forward To Joining You, Finally"). He was back in the studio working on the follow-up to The Downward Spiral, which would turn out to be an ambitious, 2-disc epic of soundscapes.
The Fragile was released in September 1999 and debuted at the top of the Billboard album charts. It soon fell off the charts due to a number of factors. Among them were a lack of marketing from the record label and the sheer length of the album. Reznor decided to celebrate the album's chart debut with a drink, which led to a relapse into drugs and alcohol.
Touring began shortly after the album's release. The Fragility tour would last a total of 8 months and travel the world. During the US tour, Reznor rekindled his friendship with Brian Warner, frontman for the band Marilyn Manson, which had soured in 1997 following the release of the Lost Highway Soundtrack. Initially Manson was offered the producer position but Reznor ultimately got it. The friendship was revived in part because of changes in popular music.
As the tour progressed, Reznor's health declined as his addictions got worse. It culminated with a tour stop in London, when Reznor overdosed on heroin, prompting a long-awaited concert to be cancelled. Citing Reznor's privacy and not wanting to bring about a media firestorm, the band's management explained that another member of the band, new drummer Jerome Dillon, was sick with a stomach flu. After the cancellation, Reznor apologized and explained the situation. He understood that people were angry about it and he stressed that concerts are never cancelled without a valid reason.
Overdosing on heroin was a wake-up call to Reznor, who now could not deny his problems. Worse news came in 2001, almost a year after the Fragility tour ended. While working on a live CD and DVD chronicling the US leg of the tour, a studio technician Reznor befriended was shot and killed in a gang-related crime. Seeing that his addictions had contributed to gang activity, Reznor was determined to get his problems under control.
On June 11, 2001, Reznor checked into a New Orleans rehabilitation center and endured a cold-turkey withdrawal experience that makes him shudder to this day. Upon leaving the facility, Reznor was more determined than ever to stay clean and sober. He finished the live set, titled And All That Could Have Been, and began to focus on other projects. Among his projects were Tapeworm, a collaboration with Tool/A Perfect Circle singer Maynard James Keenan, and producing former Rage Against The Machine frontman Zack de la Rocha's solo album.
In summer of 2002, Rick Rubin called Reznor in regard to country music legend Johnny Cash recording a cover of the song "Hurt." Reznor was honored and okayed the recording since Rubin has done great work with Cash, and it wasn't very likely that "Hurt" would make the cut. In November 2002 Reznor received a CD containing Cash's cover and wasn't sure what to think of it. About four months later he received a DVD containing a music video for the song. Reznor was flattered, honored, and moved to tears by the results.
In 2003, Malm presented Reznor with some startling news about his assets. It was revealed that he didn't have as much money as he thought he did, with his net worth estimated to be somewhere between US$400,000 and $3,000,000. Malm also presented Reznor with a bill asking for US$3,000,000 in payment. Shocked by this, Reznor looked back at the contracts he had signed with Malm and found some errors. Malm sued to collect on the money he claimed he was owed. Reznor countered, claiming that Malm had been holding back earnings. Both suits were combined into one lawsuit by a federal judge in 2004, naming Reznor as the plaintiff, with the case going to trial in New York City in 2005. Malm was fired, and Reznor signed with manager Jim Guerinot at Rebel Waltz. As a result, Nothing Records folded in 2004, being absorbed into Nothing's parent company, Interscope Records.
Reznor spent much of 2003 working on his other projects, which never went anywhere. No one in Tapeworm was pleased with the results of their recordings, and Reznor felt that de la Rocha wasn't ready to be a solo artist. The time out of the spotlight helped his psyche and got him to a better place. In addition to finding himself more mentally clear, Reznor was taking better care of himself physically, replacing the addictions that nearly killed him with healthier habits that would aid in his overall well-being. By January of 2004, Reznor was ready to write and record a new Nine Inch Nails album.
Reznor encountered a problem in the writing process immediately: he wasn't sure if he could still write music. So he set goals for himself early on: two songs written and demoed every ten days. It was a back-to-basics approach to help him decide if he could write music while clean and sober. The demo process was very stripped-down, consisting of a drum machine, a piano, a microphone, and a computer. From those demos, Reznor would determine what worked and what didn't. He found that the piano element in the demos provided an interesting contrast to the drums, and it would remain in many of the songs.
Initially, the plan was to create a concept album called Bleedthrough. As the recording process progressed, the concept was scrapped and became With Teeth, a more song-oriented rock album. It was recorded at Reznor's New Orleans studio, and it would be the last music to be recorded there. Reznor has since relocated to Los Angeles, partly to be closer to those in the music industry, but also as a way to avoid a temptation that could send him into another relapse. During the production process, Reznor invited Dave Grohl to play drums on some of the songs, at Dillon's suggestion. Recording was delayed for a few days that September when the city was evacuated due to Hurricane Ivan, which took a more easterly track at the last minute. Production ended in late 2004, and post-production began in early 2005.
March 2005 was the beginning of the press junket for With Teeth. Reznor talked about his addictions and sobriety, his reaction to Cash's cover of "Hurt," his impending 40th birthday, and the upcoming tour cycle. A new touring line-up had been assembled, and Reznor was confident in their ablilities. Five concerts had been scheduled with small venue dates throughout April and May of that year. The smaller venues were chosen because Reznor wasn't yet sure if he could still play to crowds as large as in the past. The tour sold out immediately, a sign that NIN's comeback was sorely needed.
With Teeth was released on May 3, 2005 and debuted at the top of the Billboard charts. In part its success could be credited to the nearly six years since The Fragile and the fans' dedication. By the end of the year it would be platinum.
Despite the album's success, Reznor still had to deal with the lawsuit against his former manager. Since he had to be in New York City to testify in court on May 16 and 17 (May 17, 2005 was Reznor's 40th birthday), he scheduled some tour dates there so that it wasn't all pure business. While on the witness stand, Reznor testified that he had lost trust in Malm, and that he should have read the contracts more closely. He didn't deny that his addictions may have played a role in the problems, but he still claimed that Malm was the one who was holding back on assets. At the end of the month, a jury ruled that Reznor was entitled to all assets under his name plus interest, including the Nine Inch Nails brand. Reznor walked away with an estimated US$3 million. With interest factored in, the amount could be as high as US$4–6 million. Malm could still appeal the ruling.
After the success of the club tour, Nine Inch Nails traveled the world, playing at festivals and large venues. Reznor found that he could write music sober and began working on a follow-up to With Teeth, setting up makeshift studios on his tour bus, in his dressing room, and in his hotel room. It was one way that he remained sober while on the road and was one of many safety nets he established to help himself stay sober. No longer interested in the backstage partying, he now found enjoyment in making music, which he once saw as a chore or job.
Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans on August 28, 2005. Reznor was at first concerned about his studio there, but initially it seemed like the city was spared from the storm. The next day, when the city's levee and pump system failed, Reznor was devastated. In the following days, his sadness became anger at the lack of response to the disaster, as he became even more vocal about his disdain with the US government. He was invited to perform on ReactNOW!, a telethon organized by Viacom with proceeds going to the American Red Cross to help those affected by the storm. Reznor performed "Hurt" with Cash's lyrical change, and premiered a new song, "Non-Entity," an internet-exclusive performance that would later be made into an MP3 file available for purchase. Proceeds from the MP3 went to the American Red Cross. Reznor decided that guitars used on the upcoming concerts would be sold on eBay with proceeds going to the Red Cross. It was one of many nonprofits that Reznor would go on to publicly support. In January 2006, he joined People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals' (PETA's) campaign against the Chinese fur industry, narrating a video documenting the abuse of cats and dogs used in that nation's fur trade. In February 2006 Reznor revealed that he had adopted a retired racing greyhound, emphasizing animal adoption and rescue.
When the Live: With Teeth tour ended in July 2006, Reznor rented a house in a wooded area outside of Malibu to begin turning the sounds created on the tour into a new album.
It all started with an ominous daydream about what the world might be like if things in the United States continued on their current path with no change in course. With some of his personal experiences from recent years mixed in, Reznor created the outline for what would be his most ambitious project ever. A European tour was announced for early 2007 in November of 2006, as Reznor was finishing the recording process.
In January of 2007, Reznor announced that the forthcoming album would be called Year Zero and that it "could be about the end of the world." Mixing had begun on the album and would finish on February 5. Shortly after mixing was complete, the European tour began, along with what Reznor called the "Year Zero experience." He did very few interviews during this time, not wanting to spoil the surprise. He would become more vocal about his record label and the RIAA during this time, expressing his disdain for what he felt was the wrong approach to dealing with MP3 sharing and leaking songs.
The Year Zero experience was Reznor's vision of the world in 15 years if the decline of civil liberties and an endless war on terror continued. People are drugged to keep them complacent and have GPS chips implanted under their skin. Separation of Church and State are a thing of the past and the government can now spy on everyone at every waking moment, even in their own homes. Most significantly, Reznor seems to be asking his fans to take action and prevent this vision of the future from happening, providing sites with downloadable stencils, flyers, and patterns to spread a message against censorship and the decline of civil liberties.
Year Zero was released on April 17, 2007, and debuted at the Number 2 position on the Billboard charts. Much of 2007 was spent touring outside of North America in support of the album, with only one US date. When the tour ended, Reznor returned to Los Angeles to finish working with hip-hop artist/author/actor Saul Williams on The Inevitable Rise And Liberation Of NiggyTardust!. On October 8, 2007, Reznor announced that he was no longer under contract with Interscope, allowing him to be able to distribute any future Nine Inch Nails and solo work in whatever form he desired. He also expressed his belief that being free from contract would enable him to have more direct contact with his fanbase and get his material to them in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. Interscope can still release a greatest-hits collection and is rumored to be compiling both that and a music-video retrospective. Reznor has expressed interest in helping with both of these proposed releases.
As of April 2008, Year Zero has sold 480,000 copies, giving Reznor a gross return of about US$960,000. 
Following the release of Williams' album and his release from Interscope, Reznor embarked on a musical experiment. The experiment was ten weeks of improvising and experimenting in the studio, and seeing what came out from it. What started as a 5-song EP soon grew into a 36-song collection that became known as Ghosts I–IV. Reznor released the first volume in four parts in a 2-CD set on April 8, 2008.  A download and streaming option became available on March 2, 2008. Inspired by daydreams and experimentation, Ghosts returns to Reznor's introversion and self-exploration. Around 700,000 people downloaded or bought the record in the first week of its release. Within the first week of the record's release, Reznor grossed US$1,619,420, which is US$659,420 more than Year Zero grossed in its first year of release.
Shortly after Ghosts I–IV was released, Reznor revealed that he was working on yet another "secret project." On May 5, 2008, the project was revealed to be yet another new album. The Slip was released online in the early morning hours as a free download at NIN.com as a way for Reznor to show appreciation to his fanbase for their dedication. A CD/DVD of the album was released on July 22, 2008, limited to 250,000 units worldwide, followed by a concert tour to promote it and the rest of the NIN catalog.
In 2009 Reznor announced the end of Nine Inch Nails as a touring entity, citing a feeling of monotony and routine. Following the final Nine Inch Nails show in September of 2009, he stepped away from music for a little while, emerging at the end of the year to announce that he was to begin work on some projects for 2010. In February 2010 Reznor began work on an EP for a new project called How To Destroy Angels, featuring himself, longtime collaborator Atticus Ross, and Mariqueen Maandig, a former singer from psychedelic band West Indian Girl. How To Destroy Angels released their self-titled EP for free on June 1, 2010, with a physical release available on July 6, 2010.
That same year, David Fincher asked Reznor and Ross to compose the score for his film The Social Network, documenting the rise of Facebook. The score, and the film, were released in fall of 2010. The score, as well as the film were met with much praise and accolades including a Golden Globe win and an Academy Award for Reznor and Ross. On January 7, 2011, Reznor announced that he would once again be collaborating with Fincher by composing the soundtrack to the US film adaptation of the bestselling novel The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. The film was released in theaters in December of 2011.
Today, Reznor is happier than he's ever been. He feels that he has found his calling in life and has found joy in creating music. Although he admits he could very easily relapse into his old ways, because he has been there, he has said he never wants to go back. He and his wife currently reside in Beverly Hills with their children and pet dogs.
In 2012, Reznor continued his work with How To Destroy Angels, releasing another EP and recording the long-awaited debut album, Welcome Oblivion, which was released on March 5, 2013.
In early 2013, Reznor announced that Nine Inch Nails would be touring again, despite having done a farewell tour in 2009. Several months later, he revealed that a new album entitled Hesitation Marks had been secretly recorded over the course of a year and that he had signed to Columbia Records. He cited his work with film scores and How To Destroy Angels as the source of his revitalized interest in a new direction for Nine Inch Nails.
On January 21, 2014, the Beats Music streaming service went live, with Reznor serving as Chief Creative Officer. On the same day, it was also announced that Reznor and Ross are doing the score for David Fincher's Gone Girl.

=======================================================
Nine Inch Nails were the most popular industrial group ever and were largely responsible for bringing the music to a mass audience. It isn't really accurate to call NIN a group; the only official member is singer/producer/multi-instrumentalist Trent Reznor, who always remained solely responsible for NIN's musical direction (he was, however, supported in concert by a regular backing band). Unlike the vast majority of industrial artists, Reznor wrote melodic, traditionally structured songs where lyrics were a focal point. His pop instincts not only made the harsh electronic beats of industrial music easier to digest, but also put a human face on a style that usually tried to sound as mechanical as possible. While Ministry crossed over to heavy metal audiences, NIN built up a large alternative rock fan base right around the time of Nirvana's mainstream breakthrough. As a result, Reznor became a genuine star and his notoriously dark, brooding persona and provocateur instincts made him a Jim Morrison-esque sex symbol for the '90s. A long period of inactivity and writer's block followed, which gave virtually every alternative metal band of the late '90s a chance to rip off elements of NIN's sound. By the time Reznor's five-year hiatus finally ended, he was still a popular figure but his commercial momentum had slowed somewhat.
Michael Trent Reznor was born May 17, 1965, in the small town of Mercer, Pennsylvania; he went by his middle name to avoid confusion with his father, Michael. At age five, Reznor's parents divorced and he wound up being raised mostly by his maternal grandparents; even so, Reznor stated repeatedly that his childhood was mostly happy. He began playing the piano at age five, studying classical music, and later learned tenor sax and tuba in the school band; he also acted in musicals and became an avid Kiss fan. Reznor spent a year studying music and computers at Allegheny College, but dropped out after a year to pursue music full-time; he soon packed up and moved to Cleveland with high school friend Chris Vrenna. Around the same time, he was discovering new wave and assorted underground music; he was most fascinated with early industrial, since it offered an edgy, aggressive way to use electronic instruments. At age 19, he successfully auditioned to join an AOR band called the Innocent, which released one album, Livin' in the Streets (Reznor's picture does appear on the jacket). He quit the Innocent after just three months and subsequently gigged with local bands; he also worked in a keyboard store and as a janitor in the local Right Track recording studio. Eventually, he became a studio engineer, teaching himself various computer applications and working on his own material during off hours. In 1987, Reznor appeared in the Michael J. Fox/Joan Jett film Light of Day, where he played keyboards with a trio dubbed "the Problems" during a bar scene.
As Nine Inch Nails, Reznor began recording his own Ministry- and Skinny Puppy-influenced compositions in 1988, playing all the instruments himself. At first, he simply hoped to release a 12" single on a small European label, but when he sent demo tapes to about ten American labels, nearly every one offered him a deal. He wound up signing with TVT, which released NIN's debut album, Pretty Hate Machine, in 1989 (after having rejected an initial effort called Industrial Nation). Reznor quickly assembled a backing band and toured with Skinny Puppy for a short time, but soon tired of playing for strictly industrial artists. With a tighter outfit featuring Chris Vrenna on drums and Richard Patrick on guitar (plus several revolving-door keyboardists), he consciously chose to open for alt-rock acts (including, early on, the Jesus and Mary Chain and Peter Murphy), partly for the challenge of winning over fans who might not have liked industrial music. The strategy helped expand Nine Inch Nails' fan base substantially; the single "Down in It" got some airplay in dance clubs, reaching Billboard's dance and modern rock charts, and MTV later picked up on the video for the more rock-oriented "Head Like a Hole." In 1991, after settling on keyboardist James Woolley, Nine Inch Nails became part of the inaugural Lollapalooza tour, which expanded their fan base by leaps and bounds. Pretty Hate Machine's momentum kept building slowly, and although it never climbed higher than number 75, it spent over two years on the album charts and eventually sold over a million copies -- one of the first indie-label rock albums to do so.
TVT had a massive hit on their hands, and to ensure that Reznor would produce another one, they attempted to take control of the follow-up's creative direction. Enraged by the outside meddling, Reznor tried to secure a release from his contract, leading to a vicious court battle. His only recording outlets were side projects; in 1990, he co-wrote and sang on "Suck," a track on Pigface's debut album, Gub, and also sang on the Al Jourgensen-led 1000 Homo DJs cover of Black Sabbath's "Supernaut." (TVT ordered Reznor's vocals removed from the track, but Jourgensen actually just altered them slightly and said he'd re-recorded it.) Eventually, he was able to sign with Interscope, which helped him set up his own label, the Cleveland-based Nothing imprint. Reznor had been recording new material on the sly, and in 1992 Nothing released the EP Broken as well as a concurrent remix disc titled Fixed. Broken featured more (and heavier) guitars than Pretty Hate Machine, partly in response to NIN's live sound and partly as a sonic evocation of Reznor's boiling frustration in the wake of the legal wars; it also featured two bonus cuts, a version of "Suck" and the Adam Ant cover "(You're So) Physical," a nod to Reznor's new wave roots. Despite many reviews characterizing the EP as a harrowing, difficult listen, Broken -- supported by NIN's by-then-considerable fan base -- debuted in the Top Ten and the first single/video, "Wish," won a Grammy for Best Heavy Metal Performance. Reznor enhanced his reputation as a provocateur with a widely banned clip for "Happiness in Slavery," which depicted S&M performance artist Bob Flanagan being torn apart by a machine; there was also a long-form clip for Broken that was never released commercially due to its graphic content (a torture victim is dismembered while viewing NIN videos).
Reznor moved to Los Angeles to craft the second full-length NIN album, assembling a studio in the house where actress Sharon Tate was murdered by Charles Manson's associates. The Downward Spiral was a highly ambitious work, a concept album indebted to progressive rock that featured the most detailed, layered studio craft of any NIN release yet. Hugely anticipated, the album debuted at number two and became one of the bleakest multi-platinum albums ever. Richard Patrick had departed the touring band to form Filter, and Reznor revamped the group with drummer Vrenna, keyboardist Woolley, guitarist Robin Finck, and bassist Danny Lohner. NIN caused a sensation at that summer's 25th anniversary Woodstock concert, performing a ferocious set after horsing around and covering themselves in mud just before hitting the stage. Meanwhile, MTV had put an edited version of the video for "Closer" in heavy rotation and NIN scored one of the year's unlikeliest hits: a song whose chorus began "I want to f*ck you like an animal," which helped make Reznor one of alternative rock's biggest sex symbols. The subdued ballad "Hurt" gained some further airplay, even though it lacked the titillating shock value of "Closer." Later in the year, Reznor assembled the soundtrack of Oliver Stone's controversial Natural Born Killers, editing the songs together to create an innovative collage; he also guested on "Past the Mission," a track on Tori Amos' second album, Under the Pink. In 1995, with new keyboardist Charlie Clouser, Nine Inch Nails hit the road with David Bowie, whose late-'70s albums (along with Pink Floyd) had been a major influence on The Downward Spiral. He also contributed a cover of Joy Division's "Dead Souls" to the soundtrack of The Crow and issued the remix album Further Down the Spiral, which nearly reached the Top 20 (a testament to his popularity).
Using money from The Downward Spiral, Reznor built a state-of-the-art studio in New Orleans in a building that had once been a funeral home. While pondering his next move in the wake of his sudden stardom, he produced Nothing signee Marilyn Manson's second album, Antichrist Superstar, which did indeed make him a superstar. In 1997, longtime friend Vrenna had a falling out with Reznor and was eventually replaced by Jerome Dillon; Reznor's maternal grandmother also passed away that year and his friendship with Manson soon deteriorated. Even so, he produced another movie soundtrack, for David Lynch's Lost Highway, and contributed the new single "The Perfect Drug," which flitted unpredictably between several different rhythm tracks. Though "The Perfect Drug" kept him in the public eye for a time, Reznor was still unsure what kind of statement would be an appropriate follow-up to The Downward Spiral; that uncertainty resulted in a severe case of writer's block. In the meantime, NIN were proving vastly influential on a new crop of bands; major labels signed up industrial metal outfits like Filter and Stabbing Westward, and an assortment of alternative metal bands started grafting industrial production flourishes onto their music; Guns N' Roses lead singer Axl Rose even fired the rest of his band and holed up in a studio to pursue a more NIN-influenced direction.
Nine Inch Nails finally returned in 1999 with the double-CD opus The Fragile. It debuted at number one with massive first-week sales, but slipped down the charts rather quickly afterward, perhaps because the musical climate had changed a great deal over the past five years. The remix album Things Falling Apart followed a year later, as did an extensive world tour. An album of live performances culled from the tour, And All That Could Have Been, was released in early 2002. Reznor was largely quiet during the next three years, finally re-emerging in 2005 with another chart-topper, With Teeth. Touring continued into 2006, where NIN spent the spring and summer on the road with various support acts including Saul Williams, Bauhaus, TV on the Radio, and Peaches. The EP Every Day Is Exactly the Same appeared in April 2006; it contained the title track and five various remixes (all originally from With Teeth). Touring America followed, and then late in the year Reznor was back in the studio working on the next album. In early 2007 the band resumed touring, this time in Europe. A viral marketing campaign began when USB key chains that contained new songs were found in the restrooms during NIN shows. These key chains also contained a noisy audio file that, when run through a spectrum analyzer, drew an audio wave in the shape of a phone number. The phone numbers were answering machines filled with conspiracy theories, there were fake websites strewn across the net, and busy Internet forums and wikis appeared to theorize about and document it all. The big payoff appeared in April when the dystopian concept album Year Zero arrived. A year later Reznor began experimenting with different methods of distribution when he made the Saul Williams album The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of Niggy Tardust available as a digital download. Reznor had helped produce the album and had planned to release it on his Nothing imprint but as his distaste for the major-label system increased, so did the possibilities of digital distribution. He completely broke free from the system when he left Interscope and released the entirely instrumental album Ghosts I-IV on his own in 2008, making it available in both digital download and CD formats. The album's release also marked the end of his Interscope-distributed Nothing label and the beginning of a new imprint, Null Corporation. Two months later, Reznor released (as NiN) The Slip on Null. On Ghosts I-IV and The Slip, Reznor collaborated with producer, composer, arranger, and engineer Atticus Ross. The two worked so well together they accepted an invitation from director David Fincher to write an original score his film, The Social Network. The soundtrack was released in 2010, and the pair won an Oscar for their score. Again teaming with Fincher, Reznor and Ross also wrote an original score for the American cinematic version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo; the 39-track album was released at the end of 2011. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi
