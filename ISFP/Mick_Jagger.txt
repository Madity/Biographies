Sir Michael Philip "Mick" Jagger (born 26 July 1943) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor, best known as the lead vocalist and a founder member of the Rolling Stones.
Jagger's career has spanned over 50 years, and he has been described as "one of the most popular and influential frontmen in the history of rock & roll".[2] His distinctive voice and performance, along with Keith Richards' guitar style, have been the trademark of the Rolling Stones throughout the career of the band. Jagger gained much press notoriety for admitted drug use and romantic involvements, and was often portrayed as a countercultural figure. In the late 1960s Jagger began acting in films (starting with Performance and Ned Kelly), to mixed reception. In 1985, Jagger released his first solo album, She's the Boss. In early 2009, he joined the electric supergroup SuperHeavy.
In 1989 Jagger was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the Rolling Stones. In 2003 he was knighted for his services to music.
Mick Jagger was born into a middle-class family in Dartford, Kent, England.[3] His father, Basil Fanshawe "Joe" Jagger (13 April 1913 – 11 November 2006), and grandfather David Ernest Jagger were both teachers. His mother, Eva Ensley Mary (née Scutts; 6 April 1913 – 18 May 2000), born in New South Wales, Australia, of English descent,[4][5] was a hairdresser[6] and an active member of the Conservative Party. Jagger's younger brother, fellow musician Chris Jagger, was born on 19 December 1947.[7]
Though brought up to follow his father's career path, Jagger "was always a singer" as he stated in According to the Rolling Stones. "I always sang as a child. I was one of those kids who just liked to sing. Some kids sing in choirs; others like to show off in front of the mirror. I was in the church choir and I also loved listening to singers on the radio--the BBC or Radio Luxembourg--or watching them on TV and in the movies."[8]
From September 1950, Keith Richards and Jagger (known as "Mike" to his friends) were classmates at Wentworth Primary School in Dartford, Kent. In 1954, Jagger passed the eleven-plus, and went to Dartford Grammar School, which now features the Mick Jagger Centre as part of the school. Jagger and Richards lost contact with each other when they went to different schools, but after a chance encounter in July 1960 they resumed their friendship and discovered that they had both developed a love of rhythm and blues music, which for Jagger had begun with Little Richard.[9]
Jagger left school in 1961 after obtaining 7 O-levels and 3 A-levels. Jagger and Richards moved into a flat in Edith Grove in Chelsea, London with a guitarist they had encountered named Brian Jones. While Richards and Jones planned to start their own rhythm and blues group, Jagger continued his business courses at the London School of Economics,[10] and had seriously considered becoming either a journalist or a politician, comparing the latter to a pop star.[11][12]
In their earliest days; the members played for no money in the interval of Alexis Korner's gigs at a basement club opposite Ealing Broadway tube station (subsequently called "Ferry's" club). At the time, the group had very little equipment and needed to borrow Alexis' gear to play. This was before Andrew Loog Oldham became their manager.
The group's first appearance under the name the Rollin' Stones (after one of their favourite Muddy Waters tunes) was at the Marquee Club, a jazz club, on 12 July 1962. They would later change their name to "the Rolling Stones" as it seemed more formal. Victor Bockris states that the band members included Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Ian Stewart on piano, Dick Taylor on bass and Tony Chapman on drums. However, Richards states in Life, "The drummer that night was Mick Avory--not Tony Chapman, as history has mysteriously handed it down..."[13] Mick Avory himself has categorically denied "on many occasions"[14] that he played with the Rollin' Stones that night. In fact he only rehearsed twice with them in the Bricklayers Arms pub, before they became known as the Rollin' Stones. Some time later, the band went on their first tour in the United Kingdom; this was known as the "training ground" tour because it was a new experience for all of them.[15] The line-up did not at that time include drummer Charlie Watts and bassist Bill Wyman. By 1963, they were finding their stride as well as popularity. By 1964, two unscientific opinion polls rated them as Britain's most popular group, outranking even the Beatles.[10]
By autumn 1963, Jagger had left the London School of Economics in favour of his promising musical career with the Rolling Stones. The group continued to mine the works of American rhythm and blues artists such as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, but with the strong encouragement of Andrew Loog Oldham, Jagger and Richards soon began to write their own songs. This core songwriting partnership would flourish in time; one of their early compositions, "As Tears Go By", was a song written for Marianne Faithfull, a young singer Loog Oldham was promoting at the time.[16] For the Rolling Stones, the duo would write "The Last Time", the group's third #1 single in the UK (their first two UK #1 hits had been cover versions) based on This May Be the Last Time, a traditional Negro spiritual song recorded by the Staple Singers in 1955. Another fruit of this collaboration was their first international hit, "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". It also established the Rolling Stones' image as defiant troublemakers in contrast to the Beatles' "lovable moptop" image.[10]
Jagger told Stephen Schiff in a 1992 Vanity Fair profile: "I wasn't trying to be rebellious in those days; I was just being me. I wasn't trying to push the edge of anything. I'm being me and ordinary, the guy from suburbia who sings in this band, but someone older might have thought it was just the most awful racket, the most terrible thing, and where are we going if this is music?... But all those songs we sang were pretty tame, really. People didn't think they were, but I thought they were tame."[17]
The group released several successful albums including December's Children (And Everybody's), Aftermath, and Between the Buttons, but in their personal lives and behaviour were brought into question. In 1967, Jagger and Richards were arrested on drug charges and were given unusually harsh sentences: Jagger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for possession of four over-the-counter pep pills he had purchased in Italy. On appeal, Richards' sentence was overturned and Jagger's was amended to a conditional discharge (he ended up spending one night inside Brixton Prison)[18] after an article appeared in the Times, written by its traditionally conservative editor William (now Lord) Rees-Mogg,[19] but the Rolling Stones continued to face legal battles for the next decade. Around the same time, internal struggles about the direction of the group had begun to surface.
In 1970, Jagger bought Stargroves, a manor house and estate in Hampshire. The Rolling Stones and several other bands recorded there using a mobile studio.
After Jones's death and their move in 1971 to the south of France as tax exiles,[20] Jagger and the rest of the band changed their look and style as the 1970s progressed. He also learned to play guitar and contributed guitar parts for certain songs on Sticky Fingers (1971) and all subsequent albums (with the exception of Dirty Work in 1986). For the Rolling Stones' highly publicised 1972 American tour, Jagger wore glam-rock clothing and glittery makeup on stage. Later in the decade, they ventured into genres like disco and punk with the album Some Girls (1978). Their interest in the blues, however, had been made manifest in the 1972 album Exile on Main St. His emotional singing on the gospel-influenced "Let It Loose", one of the album's tracks, has been described by music critic Russell Hall as having been Jagger's finest ever vocal achievement.[21]
After the band's acrimonious split with their second manager, Allen Klein, in 1971, Jagger took control of their business affairs after speaking with an up-and-coming front man, JB Silver, and has managed them ever since in collaboration with his friend and colleague, Rupert Löwenstein. Mick Taylor, Brian Jones's replacement, left the band in December 1974 and was replaced by Faces guitarist Ronnie Wood in 1975, who also operated as a mediator within the group, and between Jagger and Richards in particular.[citation needed]
While continuing to tour and release albums with the Rolling Stones, Jagger began a solo career. In 1985, he released his first solo album She's the Boss produced by Nile Rodgers and Bill Laswell, featuring Herbie Hancock, Jeff Beck, Jan Hammer, Pete Townshend and the Compass Point All Stars. It sold fairly well, and the single "Just Another Night" was a Top Ten hit. During this period, he collaborated with the Jacksons on the song "State of Shock", sharing lead vocals with Michael Jackson. For his own personal contributions in the 1985 Live Aid multi-venue charity concert, he performed at Philadelphia's JFK Stadium; he did a duet with Tina Turner of "It's Only Rock and Roll", and the performance was highlighted by Jagger tearing away Turner's skirt. He also did a cover of "Dancing in the Street" with David Bowie, who himself appeared at Wembley Stadium. The video was shown simultaneously on the screens of both Wembley and JFK Stadiums. The song reached number one in the UK the same year.
In 1987, he released his second solo album, Primitive Cool. While it failed to match the commercial success of his debut, it was critically well received.
In 1988, he produced the songs "Glamour Boys" and "Which Way to America" on Living Colour's album Vivid. 15–28 March, he had a solo concert tour in Japan (Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka). 22 March show was the Japanese artist Tokyo Dome's first performance.
Wandering Spirit was the third solo album by Jagger and was released in 1993. It would be his only solo album release of the 1990s. Jagger aimed to re-introduce himself as a solo artist in a musical climate vastly changed from that of his first two albums, She's the Boss and Primitive Cool.
Following the successful comeback of the Rolling Stones' Steel Wheels (1989), which saw the end of Jagger and Richards' well-publicised feud, Jagger began routining[vague] new material for what would become Wandering Spirit. In January 1992, after acquiring Rick Rubin as co-producer, Jagger recorded the album in Los Angeles over seven months until September 1992, recording simultaneously as Richards was making Main Offender.
Jagger would keep the celebrity guests to a minimum on Wandering Spirit, only having Lenny Kravitz as a vocalist on his cover of Bill Withers' "Use Me" and bassist Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers on three tracks.
Following the end of the Rolling Stones' Sony Music contract and their signing to Virgin Records, Jagger signed with Atlantic Records (which had signed the Stones in the 1970s) to distribute what would be his only album with the label.
Released in February 1993, Wandering Spirit was commercially successful, reaching No.12 in the UK and No.11 in the US, going gold there. The track "Sweet Thing" was the lead single, although it was the third single, "Don't Tear Me Up", which found moderate success, topping Billboard's Album Rock Tracks chart for one week.
In 2001, Jagger released Goddess in the Doorway spawning the hit single "Visions of Paradise". In the same year, he also joined Keith Richards in the Concert for New York City, a charity concert in response to the 11 September attacks, to sing "Salt of the Earth" and "Miss You".
He celebrated the Rolling Stones' 40th anniversary by touring with them on the year-long Licks Tour in support of their career retrospective Forty Licks double album.[22]
In 2007, the Rolling Stones made US$437 million on their A Bigger Bang Tour, which got them into the current edition of Guinness World Records for the most lucrative music tour.[23] Jagger has refused to say when the band will retire, stating in 2007: "I'm sure the Rolling Stones will do more things and more records and more tours. We've got no plans to stop any of that really."[24]
In October 2009, Jagger and U2 performed "Gimme Shelter" (with Fergie and will.i.am) and "Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of" at the 25th Anniversary Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Concert.[25]
On 20 May 2011, Jagger announced the formation of a new supergroup, SuperHeavy, which includes Dave Stewart, Joss Stone, Damian Marley and A.R. Rahman.[26]
Jagger has featured on will.i.am's 2011 single "T.H.E. (The Hardest Ever)". It was officially released to iTunes on 4 February 2012.[27]
On 21 February 2012, Mick Jagger, B.B. King, Buddy Guy and Jeff Beck along with a blues ensemble performed at the White House concert series before President Barack Obama. When Jagger held out a mic to him, Obama sang twice the line "Come on, baby don't you want to go" of the blues cover 'Sweet Home Chicago', the blues anthem of Obama's home town.[28]
Jagger hosted the season finale of "Saturday Night Live" on 19 and 20 May 2012, doing several comic skits and playing some of the Rolling Stones' hits with Arcade Fire, Foo Fighters, and Jeff Beck.[29]
Jagger performed in 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief with the Rolling Stones on 12 December 2012.
The Stones finally played at the famous Glastonbury festival in 2013, headlining on Saturday 29 June.
In 2013, Mick Jagger teamed up with his brother Chris Jagger for two new duets to mark the 40th anniversary of Chris' debut album.[30]

Jagger's relationship with band mate Richards is frequently described as "love/hate" by the media.[32][33]
Richards himself said in a 1998 interview: "I think of our differences as a family squabble. If I shout and scream at him, it's because no one else has the guts to do it or else they're paid not to do it. At the same time I'd hope Mick realises that I'm a friend who is just trying to bring him into line and do what needs to be done."[34] Richards, along with Johnny Depp, tried unsuccessfully to persuade Jagger to appear in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, alongside Depp and Richards.[35]
Richards' autobiography, Life, was released on 26 October 2010.[36] On 15 October 2010, the Associated Press published an article stating that Richards refers to Jagger as "unbearable" in the book and notes that their relationship has been strained "for decades."[37]
Jagger has also had an intermittent acting career, most notably in Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg's Performance (1968) and as Australian bushranger Ned Kelly (1970).[38] He composed an improvised soundtrack for Kenneth Anger's film Invocation of My Demon Brother on the Moog synthesiser in 1969. He auditioned for the role of Dr. Frank N. Furter in the 1975 film adaptation of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, a now iconic role that was eventually played by the original performer from its run on London's West End, Tim Curry. Appeared as himself in the Rutles' film All You Need Is Cash in 1978. In the late 1970s, Jagger was cast as Wilbur, a main character in Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo. However, a delay and the illness of main actor Jason Robards (later replaced by Klaus Kinski) in the film's notoriously difficult production resulted in his being unable to continue due to schedule conflicts with a band tour; some of the footage of his work are shown in the documentaries Burden of Dreams and My Best Fiend. He developed a reputation for playing the heavy later in his acting career in films including Freejack (1992), Bent (1997), and The Man From Elysian Fields (2002). In 1983, he starred in Faerie Tale Theatre's The Nightingale as the emperor.[39]
In 1995, Jagger founded Jagged Films with Victoria Pearman.[citation needed] Its first release was the World War II drama Enigma in 2001. That same year, it produced a documentary on Jagger entitled Being Mick. The programme, which first aired on television 22 November, coincided with the release of his fourth solo album, Goddess in the Doorway.[40]
In 2008, the company began work on The Women, an adaptation of the George Cukor film of the same name. It was directed by Diane English.[41][42] Reviving the 1939 film met with countless delays, but Jagger's company was credited with obtaining $24 million of much-needed financing to finally begin casting. English told Entertainment Weekly: "This was much easier in 1939, when all the ladies were under contract, and they had to take the roles they were told to."
The Rolling Stones have been the subjects of numerous documentaries, including Gimme Shelter, which was made as the band was gaining fame in the United States, and 1968's Sympathy for the Devil directed by French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard. Martin Scorsese worked with Jagger on Shine a Light, a documentary film featuring the Rolling Stones with footage from the A Bigger Bang Tour during two nights of performances at New York's Beacon Theatre. It screened in Berlin in February 2008.[43] Variety's Todd McCarthy said the film "takes full advantage of heavy camera coverage and top-notch sound to create an invigorating musical trip down memory lane, as well as to provoke gentle musings on the wages of ageing and the passage of time."[44] He predicted the film would fare better once released to video than in its limited theatrical runs.
Jagger was a producer of, and guest-starred in the first episode of the short-lived comedy The Knights of Prosperity, which aired in 2007 on ABC.[45]
From 1966 to 1970 he had a relationship with Marianne Faithfull, the singer/songwriter/actress with whom he wrote "Sister Morphine", a song on the Rolling Stones' 1971 album Sticky Fingers.[46]
In 1970 he met Nicaraguan-born Bianca De Macias. They married on 12 May 1971 in a Catholic ceremony in Saint-Tropez, France. They separated in 1977, and in May 1978 she filed for divorce on the grounds of his adultery.[47][48][49] Later she was reported to have said: "My marriage ended on my wedding day."[50]
In late 1977 Jagger began seeing model Jerry Hall,[51] and they moved in together and had 4 children. They married in a Hindu beach ceremony in Indonesia on 21 November 1990 and lived at Downe House in Richmond, London. Jagger contested the validity of the wedding ceremony, and the marriage was annulled in August 1999.[52]
Jagger had a relationship with fashion designer L'Wren Scott from 2001 until her death in 2014.[53][54][55][56] She left her entire estate, estimated at about US$9 million, to him.[57]
With first wife Bianca De Macias, he has daughter Jade Sheena Jezebel Jagger (born 21 October 1971).[58]
With second wife Jerry Hall, he has daughter Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Scarlett Jagger (born 2 March 1984), son James Leroy Augustin Jagger (born 28 August 1985), daughter Georgia May Ayeesha Jagger (born 12 January 1992), and son Gabriel Luke Beauregard Jagger (born 9 December 1997).[10]
He also has four grandchildren,[10][59][60] and became a great-grandfather on 19 May 2014, when Jade's daughter Assisi gave birth to a daughter.[citation needed]
His father Joe, died of pneumonia on 11 November 2006 at age 93.[61] Although the Rolling Stones were on the A Bigger Bang Tour, Jagger flew to Britain on Friday to see his father before returning to Las Vegas the same day, where he was to perform on Saturday night. The show went ahead as scheduled.[62]
In 2008, it was revealed that members of the Hells Angels had plotted to murder Jagger in 1975. They were angered by Jagger's public blaming of the Hells Angels, who had been hired to provide security at the Altamont Free Concert in December 1969, for much of the crowd violence at the event. The conspirators reportedly used a boat to approach a residence where Jagger was staying on Long Island, New York; the plot failed when the boat nearly sank in a storm.[63]
Jagger is an avid cricket fan.[64] He founded Jagged Internetworks so he could get coverage of English cricket.[64]
In the Queen's Birthday Honours 2002 Jagger was appointed a Knight Bachelor for services to music[68] and on 12 December 2003 he was knighted by HRH The Prince of Wales.[69][70] Mick Jagger's knighthood received mixed reactions. Some fans were disappointed when he accepted the honour as it seemed to contradict his anti-establishment stance.[71]
As United Press International noted, the honour is odd, for unlike other knighted rock musicians, he has no "known record of charitable work or public services," although he is a patron of the British Museum.[72][dead link] Jagger was on record as saying "apart from the Rolling Stones, the Queen is the best thing Britain has got" but was absent from the Queen's Golden Jubilee pop concert at Buckingham Palace that marked her 50 years on the throne.[73]
Charlie Watts was quoted in the book According to the Rolling Stones as saying, "Anybody else would be lynched: 18 wives and 20 children and he's knighted, fantastic!"[74] The ceremony took place in December 2003. Jagger’s father and daughters Karis and Elizabeth were in attendance.[10]
Jagger's knighthood also caused some friction between him and bandmate Keith Richards, who was irritated when Jagger accepted the "paltry honour".[75] Richards said that he did not want to take the stage with someone wearing a "coronet and sporting the old ermine. It's not what the Stones is about, is it?"[70] Jagger retorted: "I think he would probably like to get the same honour himself. It's like being given an ice cream—one gets one and they all want one."[70]
From the time that the Rolling Stones developed their anti-establishment image in the mid-1960s, Mick Jagger, with guitarist Keith Richards, has been an enduring icon of the counterculture. This was enhanced by his controversial drug-related arrests, sexually charged on-stage antics, provocative song lyrics, and his role of the bisexual Turner in the 1970 film Performance. One of his biographers, Christopher Andersen, describes him as "one of the dominant cultural figures of our time", adding that Jagger was "the story of a generation".[76]
Jagger, who at the time described himself as an anarchist[77] and espoused the leftist slogans of the era, took part in a demonstration against the Vietnam War outside the US Embassy in London in 1968. This event inspired him to write "Street Fighting Man" that same year.[78]
A variety of celebrities attended a lavish party at New York's St. Regis Hotel to celebrate Jagger's 29th birthday and the end of the band's 1972 American tour. The party made the front pages of the leading New York newspapers.[79]
Pop artist Andy Warhol painted a series of silkscreen portraits of Jagger in 1975, one of which was owned by Farah Diba, wife of the Shah of Iran. It hung on a wall inside the royal palace in Tehran.[80] In 1967, Cecil Beaton photographed Jagger's naked buttocks, a photo that sold at Sotheby's auction house in 1986 for $4,000.[81]
Jagger was allegedly a contender for the anonymous subject of Carly Simon's 1973 hit song "You're So Vain", in which he sings backing vocals.[82] Although Don McLean does not use Jagger's name in his famous song "American Pie", he alludes to Jagger onstage at Altamont, calling him Satan.[83]
Jagger's spirited vocal delivery is recognised by rapper Kanye West during the first verse of the 2008 T.I. and Jay-Z single "Swagga Like Us".
In 2010, a retrospective exhibition of portraits of Mick Jagger was presented at the festival Rencontres d'Arles, in France. The catalogue of the exhibition is the first photo album of Mick Jagger and shows his evolution over 50 years.[84] He was listed as one of the fifty best-dressed over 50s by the Guardian in March 2013.[85]
Maroon 5's popular song "Moves like Jagger" is about Jagger. Jagger himself acknowledged the song in an interview, calling the concept "very flattering."[86] Jagger is also referenced in Kesha's song "Tik Tok" and the Black Eyed Peas' hit "The Time (Dirty Bit)".
In the words of British dramatist and novelist Philip Norman, "the only point concerning Mick Jagger's influence over 'young people' that doctors and psychologists agreed on was that it wasn't, under any circumstances, fundamentally harmless."[87] According to Norman, even Elvis Presley at his most scandalous had not exerted a "power so wholly and disturbingly physical": "Presley", he wrote in 1984, "while he made girls scream, did not have Jagger's ability to make men feel uncomfortable."[87] Norman also associates the early performances of Jagger with the Rolling Stones in the 1960s as a male ballet dancer, with "his conflicting and colliding sexuality: the swan's neck and smeared harlot eyes allied to an overstuffed and straining codpiece."[87]
Other authors also attribute similar connotations to Jagger. His performance style has been studied in the academic field as an analysis concerning gender, image and sexuality.[88] It has been written for example that his performance style "opened up definitions of gendered masculinity and so laid the foundations for self-invention and sexual plasticity which are now an integral part of contemporary youth culture".[89] His stage personas also contributed significantly to the British tradition of popular music that always featured the character song and where the art of singing becomes a matter of acting—which creates a question concerning the singer's relationship to his own words.[90] His voice has been described as a powerful expressive tool for communicating feelings to his audience and expressing an alternative vision of society.[91] To express "virility and unrestrained passion" he developed techniques previously used by African American preachers and gospel singers such as "the roar, the guttural belt style of singing, and the buzz, a more nasal and raspy sound".[91] Steven Van Zandt also wrote: "The acceptance of Jagger's voice on pop radio was a turning point in rock & roll. He broke open the door for everyone else. Suddenly, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison weren't so weird – even Bob Dylan."[92]
Allmusic has described Jagger as "one of the most popular and influential frontmen in the history of rock & roll".[2] In fact, musicians such as David Bowie joined many rock bands with blues, folk and soul orientations in his first attempts as a musician in the mid-1960s, and he was to recall: "I used to dream of being their Mick Jagger".[93] Jagger appeared on Rolling Stone's List of 100 Greatest Singers at number 16; in the article, Lenny Kravitz wrote: "I sometimes talk to people who sing perfectly in a technical sense who don't understand Mick Jagger. [...] His sense of pitch and melody is really sophisticated. His vocals are stunning, flawless in their own kind of perfection."[94] This edition also cites Mick Jagger as a key influence on Jack White, Steven Tyler and Iggy Pop.[94]
More recently, his cultural legacy is also associated with his ageing accompanied by some vitality. Bon Jovi frontman Jon Bon Jovi, also a veteran, has said: "We continue to make Number One records and fill stadiums. But will we still be doing 150 shows per tour? I just can't see it. I don't know how the hell Mick Jagger does it at 67. That would be the first question I'd ask him. He runs around the stage as much as I do yet he's got almost 20 years on me."[95] Since his early career, Jagger embodied what some authors describes as a "Dionysian archetype" of "eternal youth" personified by many rock stars and the rock culture.[96] As wrote biographer Laura Jackson, "It is impossible to imagine current culture without the unique influence of Mick Jagger."[97]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Michael Philip Jagger was born in Dartford, Kent on 26th July 1943. When he was 4 he met Keith Richards until they went into secondary schools and lost touch. But one day in 1960 they accidentally met on the Dartford train line and both realized that they had an interest in rock n roll combined with blues. Between 1960-1962 The Rolling Stones formed. It comprised of Mick on lead vocal and harmonica, Keith Richards on guitar, Bill Wyman on bass, Charlie Watts on drums and Brian Jones on guitar.In 1964 they released their first album "The Rolling Stones". Eventually in 1965 they had their first number 1 hit in the UK with "The Last Time" which was followed by "I can't get no Satisfaction". Throughout 1966-1969 they toured the world with many great hits like "Let's Spend the night together" (1967) and "Sympathy for the Devil" (1968). But in 1969 Brian Jones committed suicide and Mick and Keith Richards were blamed for his death. But this fusion blew over and they got another guitarist to replace Brian in Mick Taylor. They released the album "Let it Bleed" (1969) with the track "Honky Tonk Woman". After they completed a North American tour Jagger finally went to star in Performance (1970) as the retired rock star Turner. The film was released in August 1970 with Mick starring opposite James Fox and Mick even had his first solo hit which was the soundtrack to the film "Memo from Turner".In 1971 The Rolling Stones came back with the album "Sticky Fingers" which would be the most popular album they ever made. From this album there were songs like "Wild Horses" and "Brown Sugar" and were major hits all over the world. While this was happening Bianca Jagger gave birth to Jaggers daughter Jade Jagger. Throughout the 70s The Rolling Stones made thousands of live performances and achieved endless record sales with hits like "Angie" (1973), "It's Only Rock and Roll" (1974), "Hot Stuff" (1976) and "Respectable" (1978). In 1974 Ron Wood had replaced Mick Taylor on guitar and Keith Richards and Ron Wood both played lead guitar. In 1980 Jagger divorced Bianca Jagger and went on to record and release "Emotional Rescue" with The Rolling Stones and it was a platinum album. In 1981 "Tattoo You" was released and the group went on a major world tour, their first in three years, which filled stadiums in the US and arenas in Europe. After the tour ended in 1982 Jagger was starting to like other music. In 1983 The Rolling Stones recorded the album "Undercover" at the Compass Point in Nassau. But recording sessions didn't go well as during this time Mick and Keith Richard were having arguments about the kind of music the group should be playing. Even though the album was a success it seemed like The Rolling Stones were now going over the edge.In May 1984 Mick recorded "State of Shock" with The Jacksons which led Mick wanting to try out a solo career. So in September he recorded his first solo album with guests like Pete Townshend and Jeff Beck. Shortly before the album was released The Rolling Stones decided to record their first album under a new Sony records contract. Keith Richards didn't approve of the solo efforts - he wanted Mick to stick to The Rolling Stones. In July 1985 Jagger made his first solo live appearance at the Live Aid benefit concert in Philadelphia. The Rolling Stones were going to perform but decided not to as things weren't going well for them at the time. During 1986 Mick worked on his second solo album "Primitive Cool" which he hoped would be a success but this was not to be. However, his 1988 tour proved to be a success, selling out in Japan.But Mick accepted the fact that the only way to carry on with success was to get back with The Rolling Stones so in January 1989 he and Keith Richards reformed and they wrote songs for what was to be the "Steel Wheels" album. After the album was released The Rolling Stones went on a major worldwide tour with special concerts at London's Wembley Stadium. Sadly though in 1992 bassist of The Rolling Stones Bill Wyman announced his departure from the group which was to be the following year. Even though The Rolling Stones were upset to see him leave they accepted the fact that he'd been in there too long and they had to let go. Jagger released some more solo material during this time but it wasn't such a success. In 1994 The Rolling Stones released the album "Voodoo Lounge" and they went back on tour. The first The Rolling Stones project without Bill Wyman. The tour was the biggest tour in rock history raising over 300 million. As this tour was a success they returned yet again in 1997 with the "Bridges to Babylon" album and tour which lasted for two years which was combined with the "No Security" live album and tour. After the tour was finished Jagger's marriage was on the line as he had another child from a secret love affair. Soon after this was found out the marriage between him and Jerry Hall had ended. Since then Jagger's been a film producer and a solo artist. He has produced the film Enigma (2001) and has recorded his 2001 album "Goddess in the Doorway" - another commercial flop. But never fear because just recently the Stones announced a 40th Anniversary tour and that it will start in September, 2002.
      To date (2010), Jagger has fathered 7 children from 2 marriages and 4 ladies: Marsha A. Hunt has daughter Karis Jagger (4 November 1970); Bianca Jagger has daughter Jade Jagger (21 October 1971); Jerry Hall has daughter Elizabeth Jagger (2 March 1984); son James Jagger (28 August 1985); daughter Georgia Jagger (12 January 1992) and son Gabriel Jagger (December 1997); Luciana Gimenez son Lucas Maurice Morad Jagger (18 May 1999).

      [on media coverage of him]: As long as my face is on page one, I don't care what they say about me on page seventeen.
      Either we stay at home and become pillars of the community or we go out and tour. We couldn't really find any communities that still needed pillars.
      I am conservative with a small "c". It's possible to be conservative in fiscal policy, and tolerant on moral issues or questions of freedom of expression.
      He was a wonderful, original musician who was an enormous force in music and was a big influence on The Rolling Stones. He was very generous to us in our early years and we learned a lot from him. We will never see his like again. (On Bo Diddley)
      In 1980, explaining why the Stones removed the song "Claudine" (about Claudine Longet's murder trial) from the Emotional Rescue album after her lawyers threatened to sue: We've done things that we can't use because they're too close to the knuckle as far as people are concerned. I don't mind being sued - there's always 2 or 3 lawsuits currently running against someone with more than $50,000 to their name - but I don't want to put out a million albums and then have to withdraw them...

      I'm not sure I wanna hear a whole album about meat. (Commenting in 1985 on The Smiths's album "Meat Is Murder" going to Number One in the UK)
      [on scalping and the secondary sourcing of tickets] The artist is totally powerless in this. People have made a lot of fuss about it before, but - on the other side - some people are like 'We might as well participate in it'. Why shouldn't they in a way?.. It's completely legal, so - until it's illegal - there's nothing much anyone can do about that.
Solomon Burke had such a great voice...powerful but in total control. It oozed soul. The great man had a wonderful sense of phrasing and dynamics born out of the church and gospel experience. We loved that and he was a huge influence on all of us, but especially myself in those early formative years.

Besides maybe only Elvis Presley, no rock & roll singer has been as influential as Mick Jagger, the pouty-lipped, hip-shaking frontman of the Rolling Stones. In the Sixties, Jagger established ironic detachment as a hallmark of British Invasion-era rock and began turning heads with his not-so-subtle double entendres and sinuous dance moves. He was the most assured appropriator of African-American performers' up-front sexuality, yet he was hard to pigeonhole: He alternately sounded black, very English, jaded, fired up, horny, and bored. 
Though he was a model of rock decadence, Mick Jagger has always been, as Lenny Kravitz called him, a "disciplined artist." Aside from his music, which also includes solo records and notable guest appearances, Jagger has worked in film, both as an actor and producer. Throughout his career, he wrote, co-wrote, or appeared on literally scores of beloved rock songs, mastered the art of showmanship, and influenced generations of rock & roll performers. 
Born Michael Phillip Jagger on July 26, 1943, in Dartford, England, he began singing in his church choir. His father, Joe, was a teacher, and his mother, Eva, an Australian immigrant who was active in England's Conservative Party. His brother, Chris, is also a singer. 
While studying accounting and finance at the London School of Economics on a scholarship, Jagger reunited with a childhood friend, guitarist Keith Richards, who shared his interested in American blues and R&B. In 1962, Jagger, Richards and guitarist Brian Jones formed the Rolling Stones. Jagger's bluesy vocals and spastic, often sexually suggestive stage moves got the band pegged as troublemakers — the opposite of the more clean-cut, congenial Beatles.
During the Stones' most fertile years in the late Sixties and early Seventies, Jagger began taking on outside projects, mostly film roles and musical collaborations. His first solo work was the single "Memo from Turner," which he sang in Nicholas Roeg's dark, experimental film Performance,. The movie starred Jagger as a reclusive, sex- and drugs-obsessed former rocker who'd lost his mojo. It wrapped in 1968 but wasn't released until 1970. 
That year Jagger also starred in Tony Richardson's critically panned western Ned Kelly, contributing a folk ballad, "The Wild Colonial Boy," to its soundtrack. Jagger also had written and performed a bizarre Moog synthesizer instrumental for the soundtrack to Kenneth Anger's homoerotic experimental short film of 1969, Invocation of My Demon Brother. 
In 1972 Jagger appeared uncredited as backup vocalist on Carly Simon's Number One single "You're So Vain." (Some speculated the song was written about him a claim Jagger has denied.) Jagger focused on the Stones for the next six years, but in 1978 he dueted with reggae star Peter Tosh on the single "(You Got To Walk And) Don't Look Back," which reached Number 85. 
In the early Eighties Jagger was slated to star in German director Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo, but dropped out due to logistical problems. Some of the footage wound up in the 1982 documentary of Fitzcarraldo's filming, Burden of Dreams. 
In 1984 Jagger dueted with Michael Jackson on the Jacksons' Number Three single "State of Shock." The following year, more than two decades after the Rolling Stones formed, Jagger released his first solo album, She's the Boss (Number 13, 1985), which featured guest spots from Pete Townshend, Jeff Beck and Herbie Hancock, and produced the Number 12 single "Just Another Night." Later that year, Jagger and David Bowie's duet on the 1964 Martha and the Vandellas hit "Dancing in the Street" topped the singles chart and became an MTV staple. 
After the Stones released Dirty Work in 1986, Jagger and Richards began verbally sparring in the press and there were rumors of a Stones breakup. The following year Jagger returned with his second solo album, Primitive Cool, which only reached Number 41; its single, "Let's Work," barely made it into the Top Forty. 
In the late Eighties and early Nineties Jagger refocused on the Stones and appeared in the 1992 sci-fi flick Freejack. The following year he released his third solo album, Wandering Spirit (Number 11, 1993), which he co-produced with Rick Rubin. The album featured guest appearances from Lenny Kravitz and bassist Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Although Spirit was Jagger's first solo album to win substantial critical accolades, it failed to produce a significant single. 
Jagger again turned his attention back to the Stones as well as his film work, forming his own production company, Jagged Films, in 1995, and appearing as a drag queen in 1997's Bent. Four years later he released his fourth solo album, Goddess in the Doorway (Number 39, 2001); his film company produced a promotional documentary on the making of the album called Being Mick. The album received wildly mixed reviews, some christening it an instant classic and others calling it bland and formulaic. (Keith Richards mockingly referred to it as "Dogshit in the Doorway.") 
In 2002 Jagger appeared in the psycho-sexual drama The Man from Elysian Fields. The following year he was knighted by the Prince of Wales for his "services to music." The honor was controversial not just among establishment figures but also among fans and even members of his band. Richards remarked to the BBC that knighthood is "not what the Stones is about, is it?" Jagger refocused on the Stones upcoming A Bigger Bang album and long world tour, and then in 2007 released a collection of his solo recordings, The Very Best of Mick Jagger, which followed his career from "Memo from Turner" onward. That year he also produced and acted in the short-lived ABC sitcom The Knights of Prosperity. 
Jagger has been romantically linked with a string of celebrity actors, singers and models, including Chrissie Shrimpton, Marianne Faithful, Carly Simon and many others. He's been married twice: first to Nicaraguan Bianca Pérez-Mora Macías, a former actor and model, in 1970; and second to model Jerry Hall, in 1990. He divorced Hall in 1999. 
Jagger has sired seven children with four different women: model and singer Marsha Hunt had daughter Karis Hunt Jagger (born Nov. 4, 1970); Bianca Jagger had daughter Jade Sheena Jezebel Jagger (born Oct. 21, 1971); Jerry Hall had Elizabeth Scarlett Jagger (born Mar. 2 1984), James Leroy Augustin Jagger (born Aug. 28 1985), Georgia May Ayeesha Jagger (born Jan. 12, 1992), and Gabriel Luke Beauregard Jagger (born Dec. 13, 1997), all with Jerry Hall; and model Luciana Gimenez Moradson had Lucas Maurice Morad Jagger (born May 18, 1999). Jagger has four grandchildren. As of 2008, he was reportedly dating fashion designer L'Wren Scott.

A blues' fan since childhood, Jagger studied business at the London School of Economics, where he and Keith Richards decided to form a band together.
Michael Phillip 'Mick' Jagger was born into a middle-class family in Dartford, Kent on 26 July 1943. Even from a young age, he knew he was a singer and joined the church choir. From September 1950, he attended school with Keith Richards before they went their separate ways as Jagger went to the local grammar school and Richards did not. After a chance encounter in 1960, they rekindled their friendship and decided to form a band together.Brian Jones, Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts joined what was to become The Rolling Stones.With a name chosen from a line in a Muddy Waters song, the band began to develop their fan base by playing in London.In 1964, they released their first album 'The Rolling Stones'. A year later they had their first number one hit in the UK with 'The Last Time' which was followed by 'Satisfaction'. Over the next few years they toured the world with many great hits including 'Let's Spend the night together' (1967) and 'Sympathy for the Devil' (1968).After the release of the single 'Satisfaction', Jagger and The Stones became popular in the US. Drug charges, a three-month prison sentence, and a trial helped create the decadent image that led to The Stones' recognition and fame.In 1968, Brian Jones committed suicide and Mick and Keith Richards were blamed for his death. But this fusion blew over and they soon recruited another guitarist to replace Brian in Mick Taylor. They released the album 'Let It Bleed' with lead single 'Honky Tonk Woman' in 1969.The band then released, what many consider, to be their best album 'Sticky Fingers' in 1971, which included the popular singles 'Wild Horses' and 'Brown Sugar'. At this time, Mick's first daughter Jade was born. During the 1970s, the Rolling Stones released a stream of hits including 'Hot Stuff' (1974) and 'Respectable' (1978) and went on plenty of tours.After recording an album with the Jacksons in 1984 called 'State of Shock', he wanted to try out a solo career.Jagger's solo album, 'She's the Boss', was released in 1985, but did not see the same success as The Rolling Stones,while his relationship with Richards grew sour as he disagreed with Mick going solo. His second solo effort, 'Primitive Cool', received good reviews but was a commercial failure.After a duet with David Bowie in a cover of 'Dancing in the Street' for Live Aid, Jagger returned to his fellow Stones to release the 1986 album 'Dirty Work'. Their 1989 album, 'Steel Wheels', and its subsequent tour were phenomenally successful.
They followed this up with the 'Voodoo Lounge' tour, in support of the 1997 album 'Bridges to Babylon'. Between two successful albums and tours, Jagger also worked on his most successful solo album, 'Wandering Spirit' (1993), which was followed by solo album 'Goddess in the Doorway' in 2001.On 20 May 2011, he revealed the formation of a super-group comprising himself, Dave Stewart and Joss Stone called Superheavy. They released an album on 19 September 2011. In 2012, Jagger has so far featured on a Will.i.am track, performed for the US president Barack Obama and hosted the season finale of 'Saturday Night Live'. Richards also revealed that the Rolling Stones are rehearsing together once again.Jagger also has an acting career, most notably in Nicolas Roeg's 'Performance' (1968) and as Australian bushranger 'Ned Kelly' (1970). In the early 1980s, Jagger was cast as a main character in Werner Herzog's 'Fitzcarraldo', however numerous delays in the film's notoriously difficult production resulted in him being unable to continue due to schedule conflicts with a band tour. More recently he has appeared in 'Freejack' (1992), 'Bent' (1997) and 'The Man From Elysian Fields' (2002).Jagger's private life is almost as famous as his career. After an eight-year marriage to Bianca Perez Morena de Macias, Jagger had a 32-year relationship with model Jerry Hall. Their marriage ended in 1999. However, he was involved with other women throughout the relationship and has children by several of them. He is also now a grandfather.At the ripe old age of 60, despite having spent most of his life an icon of rock rebelliousness, Mick Jagger was knighted on 12th December 2003, for his "services to popular music".
In 2008, a BBC documentary revealed that Jagger actually escaped an assassination attempt at the hands of Hells Angels in 1969. The news is revealed in a radio programme about the history of the FBI, with a former agent explaining how Jagger became a target. Tom Mangold claimed The Stones' disastrous San Francisco concert, in which one man was killed by a Hells Angel, prompted the death threat. Jagger was said to be furious about the uprising in the crowd, blaming the biker group, who had been employed to quell any trouble at the gig.Mangold revealed that the Angels were so angered by Jagger's treatment of them that they decided to kill him. He described how a boatload of gang members set-off to attack the rock icon at his holiday home in the Hamptons, New York City, but were thwarted by bad weather.

New biography reveals Mick Jagger's sexual relations David Bowie, Eric Clapton, others | Shelf Life | EW.com
As you may have heard by now, Christopher Andersen’s scandalous Mick Jagger biography hits shelves tomorrow, July 10.Titled Mick: The Wild Life and Mad Genius of Jagger, Andersen’s latest celebrity tell-all recounts the Rolling Stones frontman’s 68 years of exploits, from his sexual escapades with David Bowie to his thoughts about Beyoncé (“impressed”).
The book’s index of bad boy antics stretch back to Jagger’s childhood (wee four-year-old Mick kicked down other kids’ sandcastles) to his prep-school rebellion (he “got into serious trouble for wearing his hair too long and his jeans too tight”).
Yet, of course, it’s adult Mick who got into the most trouble. The bio’s full of salacious stories, including some new details on Jagger’s run-ins with royalty, celebrities, sex, drugs, and, once in a while, rock and roll.
Overall, Mick clocks in at 328 pages, each jam-packed with juiciness. So to help prepare you, here’s a rundown of some of the tabloid goodness: 
• The Queen of England’s longstanding resentment toward Jagger, stemming from the singer’s ambiguous relationship with Princess Margaret
• Jagger’s intimate relations with late Stones member Brian Jones, whom Jagger seduced as a sexual power play against Keith Richards
• Jagger publicly fondling an enraged Marianne Faithfull’s breasts during their first encounter (as one might expect, Faithfull — who would famously end up leaving her husband for Mick — is all over the book)
• Jagger and dancer Rudolf Nureyev playfully trapping Geraldo Rivera in the middle of a sexual sandwich at a party; Rivera claims that this was Mick’s serious attempt to seduce him
That’s a lot of Jagger! But if you can’t get no satisfaction until you know more, pick up the book and come back to let us know your favorite Mick antic.
