=======================================================
Enya (born Eithne Ní Bhraonáin; Irish pronunciation: [ˈɛnʲə nʲiː ˈvˠɾˠiːn̪ˠaːnʲ], anglicised as Enya Brennan; 17 May 1961) is an Irish singer, instrumentalist, and songwriter who is one of Moya Brennan's younger sisters.
Enya began her musical career in 1980, when she briefly joined her family band Clannad before leaving to perform solo. She gained wider recognition for her music in the 1987 BBC series The Celts. Shortly afterwards, her 1988 album Watermark propelled her to further international fame and she became known for her distinctive sound, characterised by voice-layering, folk melodies, synthesised backdrops and ethereal reverberations.[2] She has performed in 10 languages.[3]
Enya continued to enjoy steady success during the 1990s and 2000s; her 2000 album A Day Without Rain sold 15 million copies,[4] and became the top selling new age album of the 2000s in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan.[5] She received the world's best-selling female award at the World Music Awards in 2001.[6] She is Ireland's best-selling solo musician.[7] Her record sales stand at more than 75 million worldwide,[8] including over 26.5 million in album sales in the US,[9] making her one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. Her work has earned her four Grammy Awards and an Academy Award nomination.
Enya was born and raised in Gweedore, County Donegal, in the northwest corner of Ireland. She is part of an Irish-speaking, Catholic musical family,[10] the sixth of nine children.[11] Enya is an approximate transliteration of how Eithne is pronounced in the Donegal dialect of the Irish language, her native tongue.[12][13][14] Her grandparents were in a band that played throughout Ireland, her father was the leader of the Slieve Foy Band before opening Leo's Tavern, and her mother played in a dance band and later taught music at Pobalscoil Ghaoth Dobhair. From a young age, Enya appeared in many pantomimes onstage at Gweedore's local theatre and sang with her siblings in her mother's choir at St Mary's Catholic Church, Derrybeg. She attended Loreto Community School in Milford, County Donegal and then moved away to attend college wanting to become a classical pianist, continuing her studies in music and also studying watercolour painting.
Enya has four brothers and four sisters, several of whom formed the band An Clann As Dobhar in 1968. They renamed the band Clannad in the 1970s. In 1980, Enya worked with Clannad, the band composed of her siblings Máire (Moya), Pól, and Ciarán and twin uncles Noel and Pádraig Duggan. Enya played the keyboard and provided backing vocals on their album Crann Úll (1980), although she was not officially a member of the group until the 1981 release Fuaim, when she appeared on the cover. During that same year, Enya was also a member of Ragairne, the band of Altan front-woman Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh.[15] In 1982, shortly before Clannad became internationally renowned for "Theme From Harry's Game", producer and manager Nicky Ryan left the group and Enya joined him to start her own solo career. Enya then formed her own recording studio, named "Aigle", which is French for "eagle".
Enya recorded two solo instrumental pieces called "An Ghaoth Ón Ghrian" (Irish for "The Solar Wind") and "Miss Clare Remembers" that were released on the 1984 album Touch Travel.[16] She was first credited as Enya (as opposed to Eithne) for writing some of the music for the 1984 movie The Frog Prince, which was released on a soundtrack album of the same title. Another early appearance on record followed in 1987, where Enya provided spoken (not sung) vocals in Irish on the song "Never Get Old" on Sinéad O'Connor's debut album, The Lion and the Cobra.
Enya was contracted to provide music for the soundtrack of the 1987 BBC television documentary, The Celts. The music she produced was featured on her first solo album, Enya (1987), but it attracted little attention at the time.[17] The B-side single "Eclipse" is actually a reversed and modified version of Enya's song "Deireadh An Tuath" from this 1987 album.[18] The song "Boadicea", also from this album, would be sampled and modified by The Fugees on their single "Ready or Not" (1996), causing a brief stir because the group neither sought permission from Enya nor gave her credit initially. Mario Winans' song "I Don't Wanna Know" (which featured a rap by P. Diddy) sampled the Fugees sample, and is officially credited to Winans, Diddy and Enya. The song became Enya's highest charting US single, peaking at No.2 on the Hot 100 in 2004.[11]
Enya achieved a breakthrough in her career in 1988 with the album Watermark, which featured the hit song "Orinoco Flow" (sometimes incorrectly known as "Sail Away"). "Orinoco Flow", reported to be named after Orinoco Studios (now Miloco Studios), where it was conceived, topped the charts in the United Kingdom, peaked at number 2 in Germany and the Watermark album sold eleven million copies.[11]
Enya was quoted as saying: "The success of Watermark surprised me. I never thought of music as something commercial; it was something very personal to me."[19] Enya also said in an interview paraphrased, "Watermark has in its theme searching, longing, of reaching out for an answer. The ocean is a central image. It is the symbolism of a great journey, which is the way I would describe this album."[20]
The surprise success of Watermark actually led to a delay in the completion of Enya's third single, Storms In Africa because she was busy travelling the world to promote the album. Storms In Africa was re-recorded for the single and the deadline was missed. Record company WEA used TV adverts to promote Storms In Africa by reminding audiences of Enya's previous two hits.[21]
Three years later she followed with another hit album, Shepherd Moons, which sold twelve million copies and earned Enya her first Grammy Award. Shepherd Moons is also her longest charting album to date, spending 238 weeks on the Billboard 200. The songs "On Your Shore" and "Exile" (from Watermark) and "Epona" (from Enya) were featured in the 1991 film L.A. Story. "Ebudæ" is also featured on the soundtrack to the Robin Williams feature film Toys, while the 1990 feature film Green Card features "River", "Watermark", and "Storms in Africa".[22] "Book of Days" was featured prominently in the movie Far and Away, with an English-lyric version created for the film then replacing the old Irish language version on all pressings of the Shepherd Moons album from 1993 onwards. In 1993, her recording of "Marble Halls" from Shepherd Moons was featured in the Martin Scorsese film, The Age of Innocence.
In 1992, a re-mastered version of the Enya album was released as The Celts including a longer, modified version of "Portrait", which was renamed "Portrait (Out of the Blue)".
Four years after Shepherd Moons she released The Memory of Trees (1995), another Top Five success in both the UK and Germany, as well as her first Top 10 album in the U.S. Singles released from the album were "Anywhere Is" and "On My Way Home".
In 1997, Enya released her greatest hits collection, Paint the Sky with Stars: The Best of Enya, again a top five smash in the UK and Germany, which featured two new songs: "Paint the Sky with Stars" and "Only If..."; "Only If..." later became a single. ("Only If You Want To", is an early version of "Only If...". It appears on a promotional Japanese CD called The Best of Enya, and does not include the French lyrics).[23] She was offered the chance to compose the score for James Cameron's 1997 feature film Titanic, but she declined. A 1989 recording of Enya singing "Oíche Chiúin", an Irish language version of "Silent Night", has been reissued at least twice: on The Christmas EP (which otherwise contains several non-holiday related previously issued recordings by Enya) and the 1997 edition of the charity album A Very Special Christmas.[citation needed]
Ansett Australia extensively used "Storms in Africa" for promotional purposes when the airline re-branded itself in the 1990s. The 1992 film Sleepwalkers features "Boadicea" as the film's signature tune.[citation needed] "Boadicea" has also been sampled in the popular Fugees song "Ready or Not".
Following a five-year break Enya released the album A Day Without Rain in 2000, featuring 37 minutes of new material (34 minutes on the U.S. version). The album is Enya's most successful to date, peaking at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. The first single, "Only Time", was used in the film Sweet November and received U.S. radio airplay in late 2000. In May 2001, NBC began using "Only Time" to accompany commercials for their television series Friends, which helped the song top the Adult Contemporary and Adult Top 40 charts.[24]
After the 11 September 2001 attacks "Only Time" was used as a soundtrack in many radio and television reports about the attacks.[25] Enya released a special edition of the song, and a maxi single was issued on 20 November 2001 featuring a pop mix, with proceeds donated to the families of victims. "Only Time" peaked at number 10 on the U.S. Hot 100, number 12 on the Pop Chart and hit number one on the Adult Contemporary and Hot Adult Contemporary charts. In Germany, "Only Time" re-entered the German single charts at number 1[26] and the album A Day Without Rain reached number one some weeks later. Enya won an Echo Award for best selling international single in Germany of 2001, and received a nomination for best selling album.[27]
In 2001, Enya recorded "May It Be", which was featured in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, earning her an Academy award nomination for Best Original Song. It was her second consecutive single to enter the German charts at number one. The video features scenes from the Peter Jackson film.[28] Enya also performed the song "Aníron" - a song sung in Tolkien's Elvish language Sindarin - for The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.
A new song called "Sumiregusa" ("Wild Violet") was based on a Japanese poem by Roma Ryan. In September 2004, the song was used in Japan as part of an advertising campaign for Panasonic. Warner Music Japan stated that Enya's next album was scheduled for release in Japan in mid-November. Enya issued a press release on her official Web site on 19 September stating that this was a mistake and no new album was immediately forthcoming.[29]
In November 2005, a new album, entitled Amarantine, was released. It reached the Top 10 in both the UK and the US, and peaked at number 3 in Germany. The album won the Grammy Award for Best New Age Album for 2007, Enya's fourth.[30]
In 2006, Enya released several Christmas-themed CDs with newly recorded material. On 10 October 2006 Sounds of the Season: The Enya Holiday Collection was released containing six songs: the previously released "Oíche Chiúin" (a.k.a. "Silent Night") and "Amid the Falling Snow", new recordings of the standards "Adeste Fideles" (a.k.a. "Oh Come All Ye Faithful") and "We Wish You a Merry Christmas" as well as two original songs, "Christmas Secrets" and "The Magic of the Night". This CD was released only in the United States in an exclusive partnership with the NBC television network and the Target department store chain. Enya was awarded the World's Best-Selling Irish Act award at the World Music Awards in London on 19 November 2006.[citation needed]
In late November two new editions of Amarantine were released. In the UK it was reissued as Christmas Edition: Amarantine with a second disc containing the four new Christmas songs previously issued on Sounds of the Season (the original album already had "Amid the Falling Snow" while "Oíche Chiúin" is a recording dating back to 1988, which had already been featured on numerous collections). The U.S. received a special version of this release (Amarantine – Deluxe Collector's Edition), which also included three postcards and a copy of Roma Ryan's book Water Shows the Hidden Heart, which is referenced on the original album. Canadian fans could choose from the Special Christmas Edition of Amarantine or an EP entitled Christmas Secrets, which contained only the four new songs.
By mid-2007, Enya claimed to have sold 80 million albums. An American businessperson has coined the phrase "enyanomics" to explain Enya's ability to sell millions of records without giving any live performances. It is defined as the inexplicable growth in sales of an artist in inverse relation to how much publicity they have.[31]
On 29 June 2007, Enya received an honorary doctorate from the National University of Ireland, Galway.[32] Shortly after, on 10 July 2007, Enya received a second honorary doctorate from the University of Ulster.[33][34]
November 2008 saw the release of And Winter Came… with a new video for the song "Trains and Winter Rains". This album follows her passion for the Christmas period. It also features guitar on the track "My! My! Time Flies!" (an instrument rarely heard on an Enya recording since "I Want Tomorrow" from The Celts soundtrack) and a chorale version of the previously released "Oíche Chiúin". She promoted the album on morning news shows and performed some songs live.
In March 2009, Warner Music Japan released Enya's first 4 albums in a new format, called SHM-CD. On 23 November 2009 Enya released a new album called The Very Best of Enya. It includes most of her hits from 1987 to 2008, as well as a new version of "Aníron", a song created for "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" in 2001. In 2010, singer Rihanna sampled "One By One" on the song "Fading" from her new album Loud.[35]
In a May 2011 interview, Enya's manager said that she is working on a new album and will likely tour to support it, with part of the recording taking place in Abbey Road Studios in London.[36] As of May 2014, neither a new studio album release nor a promotional tour has been announced.
Enya's single "Only Time" was used by Volvo Trucks for their commercial starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, released in November, 2013, in which the action film star executed the splits while suspended between two trucks.[37] Numerous parodies of the commercial appeared online in the weeks following, again using "Only Time".
She was composer for movie Coimeádaí Na Todhchaí, whose instead Indian songs replaced her songs, but one song is duet with Brian Kennedy.
As a musical group Enya represents a partnership between three people: Enya herself, who composes and performs the music; Nicky Ryan, who produces the albums; and Roma Ryan, who writes the lyrics in various languages, except Irish, in which Enya will render the lyrics herself.[11] Enya performs all percussion, instruments, and vocals in her pieces unless specified.[11] Although there are certain pieces where acoustic instruments are featured, almost all sounds of her pieces are created by a synthesiser. Her trademark sound is achieved by layering her voice hundreds of times. According to Enya, Angeles, the fifth track on her album Shepherd Moons has about 500 layered vocal tracks.[38]
Enya's vocal range is mezzo-soprano.[39] Her signature sound uses simple arrangements with extensive multi-tracking vocals. The vocals are performed individually, and are then layered together to form a virtual choir, although all the voices are Enya herself.[40][41] In "Cursum Perficio" of the album Watermark, Enya reaches a C an octave below middle C. Later in the piece, she sings a high A-flat above the treble clef.
On the album Amarantine Enya sings in Japanese and Loxian, a language invented by Roma Ryan. The vocabulary is formed by Enya singing the notes to which Roma provides the phonetic writing. There is no official syntax for Loxian.[11] While most of her songs are sung in English, some of Enya's songs are sung entirely in Irish or Latin. Enya has also sung songs written entirely or partially in Welsh, Spanish, French, and even languages created by J. R. R. Tolkien. Enya has performed several songs relating to J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, including 1991's "Lothlórien" (instrumental), and 2001's "May It Be" (sung in English and Quenya), and "Aníron" (in Sindarin)—the latter two appearing in Peter Jackson's movie The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and on its soundtrack album. "May It Be" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.
Enya's performances are "semi-live", using playback music and singing. She has given live performances on various television shows, events and ceremonies (her most recent appearance was in Gweedore in the summer of 2005, which coincided with a tribute event to the Brennan family that took place in Letterkenny), but she has yet to do a concert.[citation needed] She does not classify her music as belonging to the New Age genre. When asked what genre she would classify her music as belonging to, she would reply, "Enya".[11]
In 1997, Enya bought a castle in Killiney, south of Dublin, for £2.5million, and named it Manderley after the house in her favourite book, Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca. Beginning with Watermark, Enya began to attract the attention of stalkers, several of whom succeeded in breaking into her castle and attacking some of the staff.[42] As a result, Enya spent an estimated £250,000 on security measures for her home. In 1996, a man who had been seen in Dublin wearing her photograph around his neck stabbed himself after being ejected from her parents' pub in County Donegal.[43]
In 2006, Enya made it to the number three spot in the ranks of wealthy Irish entertainers with an estimated fortune of €109 million (i.e., £75 million or US$165 million), and number 95 in the Sunday Times Rich List 2006 of the 250 Wealthiest Irish People.[44]
"My influences are with Irish music, church music and classical music," she said in a 1997 interview.[45]
In addition to performing for the Pope, the singer participated in a live broadcast on British television for Christmas Eve in 1997, before she flew home to County Donegal to join her family at midnight Mass.[45] She still sings in her mother's choir every Christmas at midnight Mass, at St. Mary's Church.[46]
The asteroid 6433 Enya, discovered on 18 November 1978 by Antonín Mrkos at Kleť Observatory, is named after her.[47]
Enya was the subject of the song "Pumping Iron for Enya" by Atom and His Package on their 1999 album Making Love.
The first official home video collection of music videos by Enya, Moonshadows, was issued on VHS and laserdisc by Warner Music in 1991, containing most of her music videos up until that point. This release occurred in both the UK and North America.
In 2000, Warner Music released Enya: The Video Collection on DVD in Europe, South Africa and Asia, collecting all her videos from "Orinoco Flow" up to and including "Wild Child", except for the video from "Book of Days", which was replaced by a live TV performance due to licensing complications relating to the video's use of footage from the film Far and Away. The DVD release also included interviews and features on the making of two videos.
A North American (Region 1) release of the Video Collection DVD was announced on several occasions during 2000–2001, but it did not occur; the reason for which has never been officially stated. At one point it was announced that the release had been delayed to allow the inclusion of the video for "May it Be", while the (now defunct) fan sites reported that a dispute over the sound quality of the release led to it being withdrawn.
Enya is featured in featurettes included with the 2003 BBC Video DVD release of The Celts, including performances of several songs videotaped in the late 1980s. This release was available in both the UK and North America.
In November 2009, the deluxe version of the compilation release The Very Best of Enya included a DVD bonus disc containing most (but not all) of the music videos from the 2001 release, documentaries from that release, and videos from Enya's post-2001 albums. This DVD (formatted as Region 0) was distributed in North America and remains available as of 2014.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Eithne, the fourth youngest of nine children, comes from the small village of Dore (Dobhar in Irish) in the Gweedore (Gaoth Dobhair) region of County Donegal in the northwest of the Republic of Ireland. She now lives in Killiney, a coastal district on the southern outskirts of Dublin The family is very musical and her parents played in a family dance band before settling down. Her father owns a local pub - Leo's tavern in Meenalech (min na Leice) - and her mother Baba taught music in the local school. In 1968, elder brothers Ciaran & Pol, and uncles Padraigh & Noel O Dugain, formed the band "An Clan As Dobhar" to perform traditional Irish music at festivals etc. Changing their name to Clannad, and recruiting sister Maire Brennan in 1973, the band have gone on to international success performing both their own and traditional material. They have recorded a number of albums. Enya joined Clannad in 1980 and, credited under her real name, provided keyboards and (mostly) backing vocals. She appears on their 1982 album "Fuaim". It is often said that she also appeared on their 1980 album "Crann Ull" although she is not listed in the credits. In 1982, Clannad split with their long time manager and producer Nicky Ryan. Eithne, apparently frustrated with being left in the background, left at the same time and, in Ryan's belief that she had talent in her own right, moved to live with him and his wife Roma Ryan and develop her own musical career. In 1985, film producer David Puttnam commissioned Eithne to write music for his film The Frog Prince (1986) which was released in 1985. The Titles on The Frog Prince (1986) credit music to Enya Ni Bhraonain and the transition of Eithne to Enya had begun. In 1986, BBC-TV began work on a six part documentary series charting the history and continuing cultural influence of the Celts. Enya was signed to write and perform music for the series. The Celts (1987) was first shown in 1987 and a selection of its music released under the title "Enya", giving the artist her first album, largely unnoticed at the time. Her 'big break' began in 1987 when she was signed by Rob Dickins, head of WEA Music UK, after he had heard and been entranced by the "Enya" album. WEA's backing made the recording of "Watermark" possible and the album was released in 1988. Although no singles were originally planned, it was the release "Orinoco Flow" (Sail Away) that brought Enya to public attention and resulted in an unexpected chart number one in several countries. She continued the success with her next albums "shepherd Moons" and "The Celts"...
      Adopted the spelling "Enya" in order to avoid having to continually explain how to pronounce her true first name, "Eithne."
      Director James Cameron wanted Enya to compose music for Titanic (1997), but when a deal couldn't be reached, James Horner ended up composing an Enya-influenced score for the film.
      As a recording entity, "Enya" is often considered to be three people: Enya herself, producer Nicky Ryan and lyricist Roma Ryan. The trio have worked together since the early 1980s.
      As of summer 2003, has never toured or performed a live concert. Most TV appearances have been accomplished by her either lip-synching to her original recording, or singing along with it. There have been a few exceptions, most notably at the 74th Annual Academy Awards and at least once on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992). According to Enya, tours and live concerts of her music are virtually impossible due to the logistics of trying to replicate her sound on stage.
      Comes from a region in the West of Ireland where the Gaelic language is still spoken. Although Enya can speak fluent English, her first language is Gaelic.
      A sample of her song "Boadicea" was used on the Mario Winans hit 'I Dont Want To Know'. It was also used without permission in the Fugees' song "Ready or Not." The Fugees originally did not credit Enya on their album, did not sue them, but it was later settled and she is now credited.
      The late Pope John Paul II was reportedly a big fan of her music. She was even invited to the Vatican to sing for him.
      Because of the soothing nature of her music, the singer's "Only Time" received extensive airplay in the wake of the 9/11 catastrophe. It was this exposure that firmly introduced Enya to American audiences on a grand scale.
      Vocal range changes from mezzo-soprano, to light alto on the song (s), "Pilgrim", "Trains and Winter Rains", "Pax Deorum" and "Long Long Journey".
      A lot of people know "Enya" the music, but they don't know what I look like, or what I do. And I think that that's really good... for me, and for the music as well.

Bhraonáin, sometimes presented in the media as Enya Brennan, was born on 17 May 1961, in Gweedore, County Donegal, Ireland, and is a four-time Grammy Award-winning singer, an Academy Award-nominated songwriter, and Ireland's best-selling solo artist (her record sales stand at 80 million as of 2009). She lives in a small castle in Ireland and is not married.
Enya is an approximate transcription of how Eithne is pronounced in her native Irish, in the Donegal dialect. "Eithne" comes from Irish mythology and was chosen by Enya's grandfather, what's quite
On November 16, 2006, Enya mentioned on ITV1's that she was working on a new album. A month later, in a Japanese interview Enya said that the album would be a complete Christmas album and would be released in 2007, which led to widespread fan speculation. No release occurred at that time.
By mid-2007, Enya have sold 70 million albums. An American businessperson has coined the phrase "enyanomics" to explain Enya's ability to sell millions of records without giving any live performances.
On June 29, 2007, Enya received an honorary doctorate from the National University of Ireland, Galway. The ceremony for six total recipients was held at noon. Shortly after, on July 10, 2007, Enya received a second honorary doctorate from the University of Ulster.
on security measures for her home, Manderley Castle, in County Dublin. (The castle even has an article in Wikipedia.)
and I thought 'I have never bought a single or an album'. Even as a teenager!It's strange. I don't like listening to music. People find it hard to understand that."
In 1997, Enya bought a small Victorian castle located in Killiney, Dublin. The castle, which was built in 1840 by Robert Warren, was originally named "Victoria Castle" after Queen Victoria. Enya renamed it "Manderley Castle". The name comes from the book Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier, whose story is set in Manderley. More in Wikipedia.
Also, "May It Be", for The Lord Of The Rings - The Fellowship Of The Ring, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song at the 2002 ceremonies, but it lost to Randy Newman's "If I Didn't Have You" from Monsters, Inc.
World Music Awards: "Best Solo Irish Artist" and "Best New Age Artist" (2001); Best-selling Female Artist, Best-selling New Age Artist and Best-selling Irish artist (2002), and "Best-selling Irish artist" (2006).
Eithne is Enya's true name. Enya is phonetic spelling for Eithne (pronounced as ehn-ya). She chose to alter her name because as an artist she wanted to work under her own name, yet knew how many people would have difficulties in pronouncing her Irish name correctly.
Eithne is generally used to refer to the woman, whereas Enya is used to refer to all three people who are involved with the music: Eithne, Nicky and Roma Ryan.
Nicky and Roma are a married couple that have managed Enya's career since the beginning of her solo career. Nicky is the producer/arranger/manager and Roma is the lyricist. Nicky Ryan had previously managed Clannad.
Clannad is a popular Irish family band consisting of Enya's twin uncles, Patrick Duggan and Noel Duggan, her brother, Ciaran Brennan, and her sister, Moya Brennan. Her brother, Paul Brennan, left the band in 1989 or 1990 to pursue another musical career.
Moya is Enya's older sister. Like Enya, she also has a solo career, but is still involved with Clannad these days.
Aigle is the name of the recording studio of Enya, but also refers to the Enya, Roma and Nicky Ryan collectively and and their employees as well.
Enya's eyes appear to be several different colors, blue, green, brown, and hazel, depending upon the different photos or videos. It is possible she may wear coloured lenses for the photo/video shoots. People generally agree Enya's eyes are probably not blue or brown, but either hazel or grey-ish.
Enya is NOT married. The rings she wears on her hand are a Claddagh ring and a wedding band. Both of these belonged to her grandmother who has passed away.
Enya is highly protective of her privacy. Messages sent to her home will most likely NOT be answered or even read. Please send all your letters to Warner Music at the following address:
Most photos we see of Enya are the photos in the album booklets, or photos from magazines. As it is with all artists, Enya wears cosmetics in these photos, and sometimes the photos might be retouched to create a certain look. She rarely eats red meat, prefers fish, and likes a glass of red wine from time to time.
Yes, Enya does all of the vocals and instruments herself, except where stated. besides the piano, Enya plays some of the strings and percussions, but some of these are also synthesized.
Yes, most of it. Enya did only 5 arrangements of traditional songs. "Marble Halls" is originally a piece from Balfe's opera The Bohemian Girl. "How Can I Keep from Singing?" is a traditional Shaker's hymn, and "Oiche Chiun" (Silent Night), "Adeste, Fideles" and "We Wish You A Merry Christmas" are Christmas carols.
Enya sings in Gaelic (her native tongue), English, Latin, Spanish, Japanese, Welsh, French, as well as Quenya and Sindarin, two languages invented by J.R.R. Tolkien. In her most recent album Amarantine, Enya uses a fictional language called Loxian.
Irish Gaelic: "March of the Celts", "The Celts", "Aldebaran", "Deireadh An Tuath", "Triad (St. Patrick)", "Storms In Africa", "The Longships", "Na Laetha Geal M'Óige", "Oiche Chiun", "Ebudae", "Book of Days", "Smaointe", "Athair Ar Neamh", "'S Fagaim Mo Bhaile", "As Baile", "Deora Ar Mo Chroí"
Loxian is a fictional language created by Roma Ryan. The language was created especially for Enya's music because Gaelic, Latin or English didn't seem to fit the particular mood of certain songs.
The idea to create a fictional language was inspired by the previous use of Tolkien's fictional languages Quenya and Sindarin, used in the songs for the Lord of The Rings soundtrack.
Enya Lyrics lists every song that Enya has written, sung, or performed; look under the complete list of Enya songs. Be aware that several illegal sites and P2Ps networks offer songs which often wrongly attribute songs to Enya. For example, "Now We Are Free", "Gladiator Theme", "Harry's Game", and "Love Song" are often wrongly listed as Enya's music. A list of mislabeled songs can be found in the Enya Forum.
Enya has sold more than 70 million albums worldwide. Her best selling album to date is A Day Without Rain which has sold more than 12 million copies. The latest release Amarantine sold over 4 million discs in its first year of sale.

=======================================================
was born Eithne Ni Bhraonain in Co. Donegal, Ireland.  Enya studied classical music at college and under private tuition.  On leaving college she was asked by Producer Nicky Ryan to join her siblings in their family band.  She did so for a short time, but found it too restrictive musically, and so in 1982 she joined Nicky Ryan and Roma Ryan in a creative and business partnership. Enya's first commission was to write a score for Sir David Puttnam for his film "The Frog Prince".  Then, the triumvirate secured the soundtrack to the BBC documentary series 'The Celts'.   Enya was then signed up by Warner Music and all three by EMI Music Publishing. The first album of this contract was "Watermark" with the hit single "Orinoco Flow". This was followed by "Shepherd Moons" "The memory of trees" "Paint the sky with Stars" "A day without rain" which produced the single 'Only Time' "Amarantine" and for "Lord of the Rings; the fellowship of the Ring" the songs "Aniron" and "May it be".  Enya, Nicky and Roma were nominated for a Golden Globe Award and for an Academy Award for the song "May it be" and have also merited many other nominations and awards, including the Ivor Novello for International Achievement.  The latest honours bestowed on Enya were two Honorary Degrees,  the University of Galway honoured her with Doctor of Music and the University of Ulster  honoured Enya with Doctor of Letters. 
=======================================================
With her blend of folk melodies, synthesized backdrops, and classical motifs, Enya created a distinctive style that more closely resembled new age than the folk and Celtic music that provided her initial influences. Enya is from Gweedore, County Donegal, Ireland, which she left in 1980 to join the Irish band Clannad, the group that already featured her older brothers and sisters. She stayed with Clannad for two years, then left, hooking up with producer Nicky Ryan and lyricist Roma Ryan, with whom she recorded film and television scores. The result was a successful album of TV music for the BBC. Enya then recorded Watermark (1988), which featured her distinctive, flowing music and multi-overdubbed trancelike singing; the album sold eight million copies worldwide. Watermark established Enya as an international star and launched a successful career that lasted well into the '90s.
Enya (born Eithne Ní Bhraonáin) was born into a musical family. Her father, Leo Brennan, was the leader of the Slieve Foy Band, a popular Irish show band; her mother was an amateur musician. Most important to Enya's career were her siblings, who formed Clannad in 1970 with several of their uncles. Enya joined the band as a keyboardist in 1980 and contributed to several of the group's popular television soundtracks. In 1982, she left Clannad, claiming that she was uninterested in following the pop direction the group had begun to pursue. Within a few years, she was commissioned, along with producer/arranger Nicky Ryan and lyricist Roma Ryan, to provide the score for a BBC-TV series called The Celts. The soundtrack was released in 1986 as her eponymous solo album.
Enya didn't receive much notice, but Enya and the Ryans' second effort, Watermark, became a surprise hit upon its release in 1988. Enya spent the years following the success of Watermark rather quietly; her most notable appearance was a cameo on Sinéad O'Connor's I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got. She finally released Shepherd Moons, her follow-up to Watermark, in 1991. Shepherd Moons was even more successful than its predecessor, eventually selling over ten million copies worldwide; it entered the U.S. charts at number 17 and remained in the Top 200 for almost four years.
Again, Enya was slow to follow up on the success of Shepherd Moons, spending nearly four years working on her fourth album. The record, entitled Memory of Trees, was released in December 1995. Memory of Trees entered the U.S. charts at number nine and sold over two million copies within its first year of release. In 1997 came the release of a greatest-hits collection, Paint the Sky with Stars: The Best of Enya, which featured two new songs. Enya's first album of new material in five years, Day Without Rain, was released in late 2000. In 2002, she contributed material to the first film in Peter Jackson's award-winning Lord of the Rings trilogy, scoring a hit with the single "May It Be." Amarantine, her first full-length recording since Day Without Rain, followed in November 2005. A holiday EP, Christmas Secrets, arrived in 2006, followed by an all new, full-length collection of original seasonal music called And Winter Came in 2008. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine & William Ruhlmann, Rovi

EnyaSingerBorn: 17 May 1961Birthplace: Gweedore, IrelandBest known as: Singer of "Orinoco Flow" ("Sail Away")Name at birth: Eithne Ni BhraonainEnya's breakthrough album Watermark (1988) established her as a singer of sweet, mystical, multi-layered tunes and included the hit single "Orinoco Flow," known to most people as "Sail Away."  Enya got her start as part of Clannad, a family band which performed traditional Irish music.  After she split with the group, her clear voice and good looks earned her the attention of British music impresario Rob Dickens, who oversaw Watermark and its popular single "Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)."  Although Enya is famously media shy (she rarely performs live) and her new releases are few and far between, she has since become Ireland's top-selling female artist and one of the richest women in the U.K.  She works with producer/manager Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan, and lives in Ayesha Castle outside Dublin, Ireland.  Her song "May It Be," from the Peter Jackson movie Lord of the Rings:  The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), was nominated for an Oscar.  Enya's other albums include Shepherd Moons (1991), The Memory of Trees (1995), A Day Without Rain and Amarantine (2005).Extra credit: Enya's father opened Leo's Tavern, a pub in the Irish town of Meenalech.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC.
