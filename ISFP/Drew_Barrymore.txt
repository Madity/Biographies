Drew Blythe Barrymore[3] (born February 22, 1975)[3] is an American actress, screenwriter, film director, producer, model and author who is a descendant of the Barrymore family of well-known American stage and cinema actors, and is the granddaughter of film legend John Barrymore. Barrymore first appeared in an advertisement when she was eleven months old, a 1978 episodic television debut The Waltons as Melissa in season 7: episode 4 and her film debut in Altered States in 1980. In 1982, she starred in her breakout role as Gertie in Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and quickly became one of Hollywood's most recognized child actresses, going on to establish herself in mainly comic roles.
Following a turbulent childhood which was marked by recurring drug and alcohol abuse and two stints in rehab,[1][4] Barrymore wrote the 1990 autobiography, Little Girl Lost. She successfully made the transition from child star to adult actress with a number of films including Poison Ivy, Bad Girls, Boys on the Side, and Everyone Says I Love You. Subsequently, she established herself in romantic comedies such as The Wedding Singer and later, 50 First Dates.
In 1997, she and her business partner Nancy Juvonen formed the production company Flower Films,[5] with its first production the 1999 Barrymore film Never Been Kissed. Flower Films has gone on to produce the Barrymore vehicle films Charlie's Angels, 50 First Dates, and Music and Lyrics, as well as the cult film Donnie Darko. Barrymore's more recent projects include He's Just Not That Into You, Beverly Hills Chihuahua, Everybody's Fine and Going the Distance. A recipient of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Barrymore appeared on the cover of the 2007 People magazine's 100 Most Beautiful issue.
Barrymore was named an Ambassador Against Hunger for the UN World Food Programme (WFP). Since then, she has donated over US$1 million to the program. In 2007, she became both CoverGirl's newest model and spokeswoman for the cosmetic and the face for Gucci's newest jewelry line. In 2010, she was awarded the Screen Actors Guild Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film for her portrayal of Little Edie in Grey Gardens.
Barrymore was born in Culver City, California, to American actor John Drew Barrymore and Jaid Barrymore (née Makó),[1][6] an aspiring actress. Barrymore's mother was born in a Displaced persons camp in Brannenburg, West Germany, to Hungarian World War II refugees. Barrymore's father was of English, Irish, and German ancestry.[7] Her parents divorced in 1984, when she was nine years old.[1] She is one of five children with a half-brother, John Blyth Barrymore,[8] who is also an actor, and two half-sisters, Blyth Dolores Barrymore and Jessica Blyth Barrymore (Brahma).
Barrymore was born into acting: all of her great-grandparents - Maurice Barrymore and Georgie Drew Barrymore, and Maurice Costello and Mae Costello (née Altschuk)[9] - as well as her paternal grandparents, John Barrymore and Dolores Costello, were actors;[9] John Barrymore was arguably the most acclaimed actor of his generation.[1][10] She is the niece of Diana Barrymore and the grandniece of Lionel Barrymore, Ethel Barrymore and Helene Costello,[11] the great-great-granddaughter of John Drew and actress Louisa Lane Drew, and the great grandniece of Broadway idol John Drew, Jr. and silent film actor, writer and director Sidney Drew.[12] She is also the god-daughter of director Steven Spielberg,[4][13][14][15][16][17] and Sophia Loren.[18][19]
Her first name, Drew, was the maiden name of her paternal great-grandmother, Georgie Drew Barrymore and her middle name, Blyth was the original surname of the dynasty founded by her great-grandfather, Maurice Barrymore.[4]
Barrymore's career began when she was auditioned for a dog food commercial when she was eleven months old.[4] When she was bitten by her canine co-star, the producers were afraid she would cry, but she merely laughed, and was hired for the job.[4] She made her feature film debut in Altered States (1980), in which she had a small part.[1] A year later, she landed the role of Gertie, the younger sister of Elliott, in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which made her one of the most famous child stars of the time and earned her the Young Artist Award as Best Young Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture in 1982.[4][20] She received a Golden Globe nomination as Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture in 1984 for her role in Irreconcilable Differences, in which she starred as a young girl divorcing her parents.[4][21] In a review in the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert stated: "Barrymore is the right actress for this role precisely because she approaches it with such grave calm."[22]
In the wake of this sudden stardom, Barrymore endured a notoriously troubled childhood. She was already a regular at the famed Studio 54 when she was a little girl, smoking cigarettes at the age of nine, drinking alcohol by the time she was eleven, smoking marijuana at the age of twelve, and snorting cocaine at the age of thirteen.[1][4] Her nightlife and constant partying became a popular subject with the media.[1] She was in rehab at the age of fourteen.[1][4] A suicide attempt, also at the age of fourteen, put her back in rehab, followed by a three-month stay with singer David Crosby and his wife.[10] The stay was precipitated, Crosby said, because she "needed to be around some people that were committed to sobriety."[10] Barrymore later described this period of her life in her autobiography, Little Girl Lost. The following year, following a successful juvenile court petition for emancipation, she moved into her own apartment.[10]
In her late teens, her rebelliousness played itself out on screen and in print. Barrymore forged an image as a manipulative teenage seductress, beginning with the film Poison Ivy (1992), which was a box office failure, but was popular on video and cable.[1][23] That same year, at the age of seventeen, she posed nude for the cover of the July issue of Interview magazine with her then-fiancé, actor Jamie Walters, as well as appearing nude in pictures inside the issue.[24] She also underwent breast reduction surgery in 1992, and has said on the subject:
"I really love my body and the way it is right now. There's something very awkward about women and their breasts because men look at them so much. When they're huge, you become very self-conscious. Your back hurts. You find that whatever you wear, you look heavy in. It's uncomfortable. I've learned something, though, about breasts through my years of pondering and pontificating, and that is: Men love them, and I love that."[25]
In 1993, Barrymore earned a second Golden Globe nomination, this time for the film Guncrazy.[21] Barrymore posed nude at the age of nineteen for the January 1995 issue of Playboy.[26][27] Steven Spielberg, who directed her in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial when she was a child and was her godfather, gave her a quilt for her twentieth birthday with a note that read, "Cover yourself up."[4] Enclosed were copies of her Playboy pictures, with the pictures altered by his art department so that she appeared fully clothed.[28] During a 1995 appearance on Late Show with David Letterman, Barrymore climbed onto David Letterman's desk and bared her breasts to him, her back to the camera, in celebration of his birthday.[10] She modeled in a series of Guess? jeans ads during this time.[29]
In 1995, Barrymore starred in Boys on the Side opposite Whoopi Goldberg and Mary-Louise Parker,[30] and had a cameo role in Joel Schumacher's film Batman Forever, in which she portrayed a moll to Tommy Lee Jones' character, Two-Face.[31][32] The following year, she made a cameo in the successful horror film Scream. Barrymore has continued to be highly bankable, and a top box office draw.[1][33] She was frequently cast in romantic comedies such as Wishful Thinking (1997), The Wedding Singer (1998),[34] and Home Fries (1998).[35] Barrymore's role in the costume drama Ever After (1998) offered a modern take on the classic fairy tale of Cinderella and served as a reminder, according to Roger Ebert, of how well Drew Barrymore "can hold the screen and involve us in her characters."[36]
In 2000, Barrymore was nominated for an Emmy Award[37] for her performance in Olive, the Other Reindeer.[38] Besides a number of appearances in films produced by her company, Flower Films, including Charlie's Angels, Barrymore had a dramatic role in the comedy-drama Riding in Cars with Boys (2001), playing a teenage mother in a failed marriage with the drug-addicted father (based on the real-life story of Beverly Donofrio).[1] In 2002, Barrymore appeared in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, alongside Sam Rockwell and Julia Roberts.[39]
In 1995, Barrymore formed Flower Films, a production company, with business partner Nancy Juvonen.[40] The first film produced by the company was 1999's Never Been Kissed.[41] The second offering from the company was Charlie's Angels (2000), a major box office success in 2000 that helped solidify the standing of both Barrymore and the company.[4][42] When the production of Richard Kelly's debut film, Donnie Darko, was threatened, Barrymore stepped forward with financing from Flower Films and took the small role of Karen Pomeroy, the title character's English teacher.[43] Although the film was less than successful at the box office in the wake of 9/11, it reached cult film status after the DVD release, inspiring numerous websites devoted to unraveling the plot twists and meanings.[43]
In 2003, she reprised her role as Dylan Sanders in Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,[1][42] and appeared with Ben Stiller in Duplex in 2003. Flower Films produced 50 First Dates with co-star Adam Sandler's Happy Madison company in 2004.[44][45] Summing up Barrymore's appeal, Roger Ebert, in his review of 50 First Dates, described Barrymore as having a "smiling, coy sincerity," describing the film as "ingratiating and lovable."[46] 50 First Dates was followed by Fever Pitch (2005), and in 2007, Music and Lyrics and Lucky You.[47][48] Barrymore's more recent projects include Beverly Hills Chihuahua in 2008, and 2009's He's Just Not That Into You, Grey Gardens and Everybody's Fine. Barrymore's directorial debut film Whip It, was released in October 2009. Whip It starred Ellen Page and Marcia Gay Harden and centered on an obsession with beauty pageants and the Austin, Texas, Hurl Scouts roller derby team. Barrymore also co-starred in the film.[49]
In 2010, Barrymore reunited with former partner Justin Long on the set of Going the Distance, directed by Nanette Burstein. An R-rated romantic comedy about a couple dealing the ups and downs of a long-distance relationship while commuting between New York City and San Francisco, the largely improvised film garnered generally mixed reviews by critics,[50] who summed it as "timelier and a little more honest than most romantic comedies."[51] Budgeted at US$32 million,[52] the film became a moderate financial success at a worldwide box office total of US$40 million.[53]
In 2011, it was announced that Barrymore starred with John Krasinski in Ken Kwapis's Big Miracle (2012), a romantic drama based on the 1989 book Freeing the Whales, which covers Operation Breakthrough, the 1988 international effort to rescue gray whales from being trapped in ice near Point Barrow, Alaska.[54] On August 2, 2011, Barrymore directed the music video for the song "Our Deal," for the band Best Coast, which features Chloë Grace Moretz, Miranda Cosgrove, Tyler Posey, Donald Glover, Shailene Woodley and Alia Shawkat.[55]
In 1999, Barrymore was honored by the Young Artist Foundation with its Former Child Star "Lifetime Achievement" Award commemorating her outstanding achievements within the film industry as a child actress.[56] In 2005, she began a recurring role in the animated comedy Family Guy as Brian Griffin's simple-minded girlfriend, Jillian.[57] She has since appeared in a total of eleven episodes.[57][58][59][60] She was the subject of the 2005 documentary My Date with Drew. In it, an aspiring filmmaker and a fan of Barrymore's, uses his limited resources in an attempt to gain a date with her.[61] On February 3, 2004, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[62]
Barrymore's films have a worldwide box office gross that stands at over US$2.3 billion. According to The Hollywood Reporter's annual Star Salary Top 10, she was tied for eighth place on the top ten list of actresses' salaries, commanding 10 to 12 million dollars per movie for 2006.[63] Barrymore became the youngest person to have hosted Saturday Night Live (SNL) having hosted on November 20, 1982 at 7 years old, a record that hasn't been broken.[64][65] On February 3, 2007, Barrymore hosted SNL for the fifth time,[42] making her the second female host (after Candice Bergen) in the show's history to do so. She hosted again on October 10, 2009, becoming the first female to host six times. In March 2012, Barrymore began co-hosting the twelfth season of The Essentials, a film showcase on Turner Classic Movies which spotlights significant classic films.[66] She will be hosting alongside TCM regular, Robert Osborne.
Barrymore became a CoverGirl Cosmetics' model and spokeswoman in 2007.[67] Today, Drew Barrymore is still one of the faces for CoverGirl, alongside Queen Latifah and Taylor Swift. The company partnered up with Drew because "she emulates the iconic image of CoverGirl with her fresh, natural beauty and energetic yet authentic spirit" said Esi Eggleston Bracey, Vice President and General Manager of CoverGirl Cosmetics North America. She has brought not only her personality into this endorsement but also her creative side, as she is also a co-creator of the ads.[68] She was No. 1 in People's annual 100 Most Beautiful People list in 2007.[69] Also in 2007, she was named the new face for the Gucci jewelry line.[70][71] Barrymore is signed to IMG Models New York City.
In May 2007, Barrymore was named Ambassador Against Hunger for the United Nations World Food Programme[72][73] and later donated $1 million to the cause.[42][74] In September 2010, Barrymore was confirmed to play the role of Ganga in the Indian Bollywood film The Lifestyle – In Generation Next to be directed by Santosh Kumar Jain, to be released in 2012.[needs update] [75] Several articles and interviews reported Barrymore's taste for photography. As a guest photographer for a magazine series called "They Shoot New York," she appeared on the cover holding a Pentax K1000 film camera.[76] She hopes to expose her work in a gallery one day, as she documented the last decade of her life with a Pentax camera.[77]
Barrymore stated during an appearance talk show The View that she enjoys practicing Judaism and is thinking of converting. "It's a beautiful faith and I'm so honored to be around it. It's so family-oriented [and] the stories are so beautiful and it's incredibly enlightening. I'm really happy."[78]
Concerning her sexuality, in an interview with Contact Music in 2003, Barrymore said "Do I like women sexually? Yeah, I do. Totally. I have always considered myself bisexual."[79] Barrymore was quoted in 2004 as saying, "A woman and a woman together are beautiful, just as a man and a woman together are beautiful. Being with a woman is like exploring your own body, but through someone else. When I was younger I used to go with lots of women. Totally. I love it".[80] In March 2007, former magazine editor Jane Pratt claimed on her Sirius Satellite Radio show that she had a romance with Barrymore in the mid-1990s.[81]
In 1991, at the age of 16, Barrymore became engaged to Leland Hayward, grandson and namesake of Hollywood producer Leland Hayward.[83] After a few months, this engagement was called off.[84] Barrymore was engaged to and lived with musician and actor Jamie Walters from 1992 to 1993.[85]
Barrymore married her first husband, Welsh bartender turned Los Angeles bar owner Jeremy Thomas, at the age of nineteen on March 20, 1994. She filed for divorce from him less than two months later.[1][10]
Barrymore began dating MTV host and comedian Tom Green in 1999. Barrymore and Green lived together for a year before getting engaged in July 2000. They wed in July 2001.[1] Green filed for divorce in December 2001.[86] The divorce was finalized on October 15, 2002. Before their divorce, they starred together in Charlie's Angels and Green's first directorial movie Freddy Got Fingered.[86][87]
In 2002, Barrymore began dating The Strokes' drummer Fabrizio Moretti, soon after they met at a concert.[1][42] Their five-year relationship ended in January 2007.[42][88] She then began dating actor Justin Long,[89] but they confirmed they broke up in July 2008.[90] Barrymore and Long reunited in 2009 and co-starred in the 2010 film Going the Distance, but reportedly broke up again in 2010.[91]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Since melting audiences' hearts - at the age of six - with her big-screen breakout in Steven Spielberg's beloved sci-fi classic, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Drew Barrymore has emerged as one of the most endearing and talented actresses of her generation.Despite a troubled and much-publicized adolescence during which she appeared in only a handful of films, Barrymore's star was officially on the rise during the mid-1990s with appearances in Poison Ivy (1992), Bad Girls (1994), Boys on the Side (1995), Batman Forever (1995), Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You (1996) and Wes Craven's game-changing horror hit Scream (1996).High-profile turns in The Wedding Singer (1998), EverAfter (1998), Never Been Kissed (1999), Charlie's Angels (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), Riding in Cars with Boys (2001) and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002) followed, proving to once-cynical audiences that Barrymore was not only a capable leading lady, but also a gifted and versatile actor.Next came headlining parts in Duplex (2003), 50 First Dates (2004), Fever Pitch (2005), Music and Lyrics (2007), Lucky You (2007), He's Just Not That Into You (2009) and the much-lauded Grey Gardens (2009), which earned Barrymore rave reviews (as well as Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards) for her portrayal of Edith Bouvier Beale, the real-life cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy.In 2009, Barrymore - whose production company, Flower Films, has spawned several lucrative projects - made her long-awaited directional début with the comedy-drama Whip It (2009), emerging as "a sensitive director who knows how and when to let an emotional moment linger on the screen" (TIME).Alongside a recurring guest spot (as the voice of Jillian) on the award-winning animated series Family Guy (1999), recent acting roles have included Everybody's Fine (2009) (opposite Robert De Niro), Going the Distance (2010), Big Miracle (2012) and Blended (2014), her third collaboration with Adam Sandler.
      She was, at seven years old, the youngest person ever to host. She was the Guest Host for Saturday Night Live (1975) when viewers voted that Andy Kaufman would never be allowed to return to the show.
      Originally offered the lead role in Scream (1996) but chose to play Casey Becker because she thought it would be more fun.
      Daughter of John Drew Barrymore and Jaid Barrymore. Half-sister of Jessica, Blyth Dolores and John Blyth Barrymore. Niece of actress Diana Barrymore. Granddaughter of actor John Barrymore and Dolores Costello, on her father's side. Great-granddaughter of silent film actor Maurice Costello and Mae Costello. Great-niece of famed actors, Ethel Barrymore and Lionel Barrymore.
Steven Spielberg gave her a quilt for her birthday with a note "Cover yourself up". Enclosed was a copy of the January 1995 issue of Playboy Magazine for which she posed nude, with the pictures altered by Spielberg's art department so that she appeared fully clothed.
      She was formerly a vegan: "I don't eat a ton of meat, and I don't wear a ton of leather, but I just don't put strict limitations on myself anymore".
      Was offered the leading part of Nomi Malone in Showgirls (1995), but turned it down because she felt uncomfortable with the explicit nudity displayed in the script.
      Her $3-million Beverly Hills mansion caught fire while she and fiance Tom Green were inside sleeping. The couple made it safely out, but the house was ruined. [February 2001]
      During an appearance on The Rosie O'Donnell Show (1996), she said that she never watches any of the movies she stars in.
      Began a relationship with Tom Green in February 2000, before getting engaged to him in July 2000. They married on 7 July 2001, but separated in December 2001 after just five months of marriage. Their divorce was finalized in October 2002.
      Married Tom Green twice: first eloping to the South Pacific in March 2001, then on July 7, 2001 before family and friends in a ceremony in Malibu, California. She and Tom Green then honeymooned in Ireland.
      In honour of Bill Clinton turning 50, John Kennedy Jr. had Drew pose as Marilyn Monroe on the cover of his magazine, "George", with the heading, "Happy Birthday, Mr. President", which Marilyn Monroe sang to his father at the now-infamous 19 May 1962 Birthday Salute to President John F. Kennedy. (September 1996).

      Was in a long-term relationship with The Strokes drummer, Fabrizio Moretti (June 2002-December 2006).
      Her first of two impulsive marriages was to Welsh-born Jeremy Thomas, who was a Los Angeles barkeep. They had known each other only six weeks before they married, which was decided within hours one night. The impromptu setting was at Thomas' bar, "The Room," on Cahuenga Boulevard, shortly after 5:00 a.m, on March 20, 1994. Supposedly both were sober. The minister was a clairvoyant from a psychic hot line who arrived within a half an hour after being paged.

      I know certain actors are totally screwed up on drugs, yet it gets covered up. Why wasn't I excused for 'exhaustion' or 'the flu'?
      If I ever start talking to you about my 'craft', my 'instrument', you have permission to shoot me.
      I believe in fate. I believe that everything happens for a reason, but I think it's important to seek out that reason - that's how you learn.
      [on her favorite movies to make]: I try to make movies that I would want to go see rather than ones I would just want to do as an actor. I want people to have movies full of romance and hope and empowerment, something they can escape into and feel good about. I love happy endings.
      [on her morning routine]: Every morning I stay in bed for ten minutes to ponder my place in the universe. Then I wash my face and check my karma.
      Life is very interesting. In the end, some of your greatest pains become your greatest strengths.
      I'm getting older so those dark circles are really starting to show. Now, I'm starting to look like Night of the Living Dead.
      When I lay my head on the pillow at night, I can say "I was a decent person today". That's when I feel beautiful.
      [As quoted in Woman's World (5-24-05 issue]: I'd rather be a few pounds heavier and enjoy life than be worried all the time.
      [Quoted in Woman's Day, 11-1-05]: My whole life, I've wanted to feel comfortable in my skin. It's the most liberating thing in the world.
      As much light as I have inside me, there's just as much darkness, I'm afraid. There's a polarity, and I still have demons to work out.
      "I love women who have fought to the change the world and made a difference. I want to be one of them myself".
      I did karaoke once - a Pat Benatar song - and my friends looked at me with disgust (In Style/Sept/2006).
      I just think happiness is what makes you pretty. Period. Happy people are beautiful. They become like a mirror and they reflect that happiness. If somebody walks in the room and they're drop-dead gorgeous and sexy, it's really fun to look at. But if someone is giving of their spirit and they make you laugh and feel good, that's a whole other level of beauty.
      [on her attraction to Christian Bale] He's so cute! And I knew him when he was a kid. He was in Empire of the Sun (1987). If he walked into the room now, I would totally clam up. Or I might go overboard and embarrass myself.
      On California's Proposition 8 (the ballot banning same-sex marriage): We can't take a step backwards when we've already made so many strides forward. I was raised by gay men and women...it's who I am, you cannot define a family. There are children out there who need these loving homes. These are rights that are fundamental and must be had. And I will fight for however long it takes; I don't want to live in a world where prop 8 exists!
      [on gay marriage]: You can't define love and you can't define a family. It comes in so many radical colors. And children need loving homes and people want to adopt who are gay! Why would we ever try to stand in their way? It's unfathomable.
      [When asked about gay rights] A lot of the people that I grew up around had a freedom of their sexual orientation and I just think that civil liberties are the key to life, so obviously I'm a huge supporter of that.
      [on kissing Ellen Page]: We do that all the time, we're friends. People can take from it what they want. We're just girls being silly and having fun, girls are affectionate with each other. We don't have that hang up of what it's gonna look like or what people are gonna think. I think it's hysterical.
      [on her divorce from Tom Green]: Yes, it's true we have decided to part. I love Tom very much. He has always been a great friend and that won't change.
      California has, like, half the swimming pools in the whole USA. After you're successful you can't not have a pool. Here, a house without a pool is like a neck with no diamond necklace.
      Happiness is the best makeup in the world. There's nothing you can put on your face that comes from a tube that's going to be as amazing as a smile.
      I wish I were that all-home-grown-food perfect woman, but I'm not. I'm the mom with the kitchen on fire and food on our faces.
      [on the best advice Steven Spielberg ever gave her, and how she doesn't feel she is a good actor] Steven told me, 'Don't act your characters. Be your characters.' I feel like it's fake and yucky and it just doesn't ring true. But like Robert said, if you research and you study and make it personal, you just become that person, and it's your truth and everything else around you falls away. Then you're telling the truth, it's not lying, it's not fake. So he gave me that wisdom because at 6, I guess I was comfortable and more humorous than I would have remembered now. But once I got older and kept continuing acting, I don't know if I would have succeeded without that advice, because it's the thing that saved me. I'm not an actor, I'm a pretender.
      [on what movie blew her mind] I think it changes every day. But today it's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" My jaw was on the floor when I was watching it because it was the definition of visceral. I thought it was the most compelling, upsetting, beautiful-to-look-at, in-your-face film, with no tricks whatsoever, except for beautiful camera work.
      [on what films shaped her the most] "Pollyanna," "Captains Courageous," "Black Stallion," "Foxes," um, "Excalibur?" I was, like, obsessed with "Camelot" and "Excalibur" and "Anne of a Thousand Days" - any double-VHS-giant double-Beta set of those films. I just loved the swashbuckling nature of them, I was obsessed. I loved watching men in cinema, and I liked watching young girls, whether it was a Jodie Foster in "Foxes" or a Hayley Mills in "Pollyanna." It could be squeaky clean and it could be super like L.A. streets-gritty, but there was no barrier between. I liked older men and younger girls. That was what I responded to in film.
=======================================================
                Drew Blyth Barrymore's father was the actor John Drew Barrymore, and her mother was the Hungarian actress Ildiko Jaid Barrymore.Her parents divorced soon after she was born, but she also has a half-brother, called John Blyth Barrymore and two half sisters - Blyth Dolores Barrymore and Brahma (Jessica) Blyth Barrymore. As if it wasn’t enough that both her parents were actors, Drew was born into an acting dynasty that stretched back for over two hundred years. Her grandfather, John Barrymore, was widely regarded as the most outstanding and highly acclaimed actor of his generation, and her grandmother, Dolores Costello, was also a very gifted actress. A couple of generations earlier, her great-great grandparents John Drew and Louisa Lane Drew were also actors; as were her great grandparents Maurice Barrymore, Georgiana Drew and Maurice Costello. Drew is also the grand-niece of Lionel Barrymore, Ethel Barrymore and Helene Costello, and the great grand-niece of John Drew Jr., the actress Louisa Drew, and the silent film actor/writer/director Sidney Drew. In addition, her father and half-brother are also both actors. And if all that weren’t enough, Drew also happens to be the god-daughter of movie director Steven Spielberg. Drew’s first name was the maiden name of her paternal great-grandmother, Georgiana Drew; her middle name, Blyth, was the original surname of the acting dynasty founded by her great-grandfather, the famous Maurice Barrymore. With such an extraordinary acting background, maybe it was a foregone conclusion that Drew should follow in the footsteps of her illustrious forbears. Amazingly, she actually made her acting debut at the age of only 11 months old, when she auditioned for a dog food commercial. Right from the start, Drew showed herself to be a true “pro” - when she was bitten by her co-star, the dog, the producers naturally assumed that she’d burst out crying - but instead, she simply laughed it off, and secured her first job on the spot! Drew went on to even greater things at a very early age, and soon became one of Hollywood‘s foremost child actresses. She played the part of Gertie in Steven Spielberg’s classic film, 'ET: The Extra Terrestrial' at the age of seven, and this was the role that first made her famous. Two years later, she followed this up by playing the role of Casey Brodsky in 'Irreconcileable Differences'; her performance in this movie secured her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Despite the early stardom, Drew underwent a difficult and stormy childhood, which drove her to seek solace in drugs and alcohol at a shockingly young age. She was already a regular club-goer at the famous Studio 54 in New York, despite the fact that she was actually still a child, and her constant partying served to make her a well-known name in the tabloid gossip columns. She was allegedly drinking alcohol by the time she was nine, smoking marijuana at the age of ten, and had graduated to snorting cocaine by the time she reached 12.Drew talks about this unhappy period of her life at some length in her autobiography, “Little Girl Lost“, in particular the lack of support that she feels she failed to receive from her mother. In order to underline this fact, Drew officially “divorced” her mother when she reached the age of 17. But she claims to be pleased at the fact that she succeeded in achieving a reconciliation with her father, shortly before he died. Notwithstanding her troubled relationship with her parents, Drew enrolled in a rehab programme, and succeeded in overcoming her problems with alcohol and substance abuse by the time she had left her teens. Despite winning her battle with her addictions, Drew still retained something of a “naughty girl” image, which she capitalised upon in her comeback movie, 'Poison Ivy', in 1992. In this film, Drew played a malicious, evil-minded teenage temptress, and and cast aside her child star image in order to reinvent herself as a newfound sex symbol. Drew also continued to attract the attention of the tabloids, thanks to her habit of allowing herself to be filmed and photographed in compromising poses. She posed nude for the January 1995 issue of Playboy magazine, much to the disgust of her god-father Steven Spielberg, who sent her a quilt as a 20th birthday present, together with a card that bore the message, “Cover Yourself Up”. He also enclosed various copies of the Playboy pictures, that he’d had specially altered by his art department, so that Drew now appeared fully clothed. Around this same period, Drew had actually appeared in the nude in her last five movies. She also attracted media attention for her exhibitionistic behaviour during an appearance on the 'David Letterman Show'. During the interview, Drew climbed on to the talk show host’s desk and, with her back to the camera, bared both her breasts to him! Apparently, Drew’s flamboyant gesture was intended to be a birthday present for Mr Letterman... Drew built on the success she’d achieved in 'Poison Ivy', and also appeared in the successful 1996 horror film, 'Scream'. Since her comeback in the 1990s, she has continued to be highly popular with cinema-going audiences, especially when she appears in romantic comedies, such as 'The Wedding Singer' (1998), 'Never Been Kissed' (1999) and in particular, '50 First Dates' (2004). One critic who reviewed the film described Drew as having a “smiling, coy sincerity”, and the film itself as “ingratiating and lovable”. Barrymore also starred in the action movie 'Charlie’s Angels', where she teamed up with fellow Hollywood stars Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu; the trio of beauties have subsequently become firm friends. 'Charlie’s Angels' was one of the first films that Drew produced, and she now has her own production company called Flower Films. Shortly after the success of 'Charlie’s Angels', Drew achieved box-office success for her straight dramatic acting in 'Riding in Cars With Boys', a story that was based on the real-life story of Beverly D’Onofrio, a teenage mother who experienced a failed relationship with her drug-addicted boyfriend.Next came Richard Kelly’s debut movie, 'Donnie Darko', where she played the character of Karen Pomeroy, Donnie Darko’s English teacher. In 2002, Drew appeared in 'Confessions of A Dangerous Mind', alongside one of the other main Hollywood leading ladies, Julia Roberts. In 2003, Drew starred in the sequel to 'Charlie’s Angels'; this follow-up movie was called 'Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle'. To mark the occasion, Maxim Magazine featured Drew and her fellow Angels Diaz and Liu in their “Girls of Maxim” gallery, shortly after the film was released. To mark the fact that Drew Barrymore had succeeded in totally reinventing herself, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 3rd, 2004. In more recent years, Drew’s screen image has become progressively more “normal” and wholesome, in contrast to her former image as a recovering substance and alcohol abuser, “teenage sexpot” and “poor little rich girl.” Some of her greatest successes have been garnered from her starring performances in romantic comedies, such as 'The Wedding Singer' and '50 First Dates', alongside goofball comedy actor Adam Sandler. In 2005, she was the subject of a film called 'My Date With Drew', where a wannabe film-maker and Drew Barrymore fan strives to obtain a date with the celebrity object of his affections! She also scored a hit as a comedy actress through her appearance as a recurring character on the animated comedy 'Family Guy', where she played the role of Brian Griffin’s shallow girlfriend Jillian in several episodes. In 2005 she starred in the Farrelly brothers' romantic comedy 'Fever Pitch', a remake of a 1997 British film, which paved the way for her appearance in 2007's 'Lucky You' and 'Music and Lyrics' alongside Hugh Grant. Drew has always loved to sing, and this film provided the perfect vehicle for her vocal talents, since she insisted on singing all her own songs on the movie soundtrack. This effort was rewarded with a Blimp Award nomination for favourite female movie star. She followed this up with 'He's Just Not That Into You' (2009), which featured an ensemble cast including Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Scarlett Johansson and Jennifer Connelly and performed well at the box office. Her portrayal of Edith Bouvier Beale in the made-for-cable HBO film 'Grey Gardens' (2009) also won her further critical approval as a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress came her way. She also won a Satellite Award for Best Actress and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor for her role. Having harboured a desire to step behind the camera and call the shots like her godfather Steven Spielberg, Drew made her directorial debut with 'Whip It' (2009) in which she also played an acting role. It received generally positive reviews and was followed by 2010's 'Going the Distance'. Drew's numerous screen performances have resulted in handsome box office returns: to date, she has a worldwide box office gross that stands in excess of $2.3 billion. According to the Hollywood Reporter’s annual Star Salary Top 10, she received the second highest salary per movie in Hollywood in 2006. Drew is a big success on TV shows too. In common with Adam Sandler, she has been a guest host on 'Saturday Night Live'. Drew also has the honour of being the youngest ever celebrity to host the show, since she first hosted SNL in 1982, when she was only 7! Drew’s love life, however, looks to have been slightly less fortunate than her career, for she‘s been married and divorced twice. She married Jeremy Thomas in 1994, and the couple were divorced in 1995. She then married Tom Green in 2001, and got divorced in 2002. She went on to date The Strokes' drummer Fabrizio (Fab) Moretti, but the relationship ended in 2007 after five years. A union with 'Going the Distance' co-star Justin Long did not last long either. She still considers herself an incurable romantic, however, and describes herself as “a sucker for romance”! Even if her love life runs less than smoothly, it’s almost certain that she’ll be starring in many, many more big-screen romances in movie theatres worldwide.

 At the tender age of 7, starring in Steven Spielberg’s landmark film E.T.—The Extra-Terrestrial, Drew Barrymore won our hearts in a way that no other child had since Shirley Temple. Before the age of 12, she was a movie star, an international icon, and, sadly, the heir to her legendary family’s legacy of substance abuse. Her burgeoning career was soon eclipsed by her off-screen antics. At the age of 12, she was addicted to cocaine. In 1988, she entered rehab, got clean a year later, but not before a relapse and a suicide attempt. Drew Barrymore might have lived out her years as a washed-up child star, but after a two-year absense, she returned in the pivotal Poison Ivy. From the mid-90s, she appeared in a string of hit films, including Scream, The Wedding Singer, Woody Allen’s Everyone Says I Love You, and 50 First Dates. The actress has also added another string to her bow as producer and co–star of the highly successful Charlie’s Angels films.

       Lucy Ellis & Bryony Sutherland are the authors of Uma Thurman: The Biography and Nicole Kidman: The Biography (both published by Aurum Press), as well as biographies of Julie Walters, Kylie Minogue, Annie Lennox and Tom Jones.
  After reading this biography my opinion on Drew Barrymore changed 100%. The authors challenge the way she is so often presented in the media throughout the book by demonstrating her bizarre upbringing and precocious achievements. Although ditzy would sometimes be a good word to describe her I now realise she's extremely hard working and dedicated to her career. Her private life also makes for good reading and it's all presented here in an informative but entertaining way.
  I really don't have anything against Drew Barrymore, and it is too bad that she got into drug and alchohol abuse at such a young age, but without the drugs she still is a major airhead deluxe. Just listen to her when she's on Jay Leno or David Letterman. I remember a few years ago she was all psyched when she was on the tonight show with Jay Leno because she learned a few things about politics and she had to share that knowledge with the audience. Wow what a major airhead!!!! She probably wouldn't be in movies if she hadn't been in commercials and movies when she was very young. There might be a few teenage girls that might be interested in this book but most should steer clear of this biography.

Birth Name: Drew Blythe BarrymoreBirth Place: Los Angeles, California, United StatesDate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 02/22/1975, PiscesProfession: Actor; producer; director
Child stars are known for capturing the hearts of audiences, but few of them do so into adulthood. Yet this winning actress continues to charm decades after making a splash as a 7-year-old alien-loving cutie in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Unfortunately, while Barrymore inherited the talents of her famous ancestors Lionel, Ethel and John, she also inherited their addictive personalities. While starring as a sweetie pie in a series of '80s films, the adolescent was leading a troubled off-screen life. By the end of the decade, she landed in rehab and her career was in jeopardy. After cleaning up, she reinvented herself on screen as a bad girl (Poison Ivy, The Amy Fisher Story) before finally settling on a sweet, effervescent yet clearly grown-up persona in a string of '90s comedies (The Wedding Singer, Home Fries and Never Been Kissed, the first of many vehicles she produced for herself). In 2000 she added butt-kicking to her résumé as one of three comely detectives in the blockbuster Charlie's Angels, which she also produced, catapulting her to the top of the Hollywood A-list. Barrymore stayed busy in the '00s, starring in a number of successful films, including 50 First Dates, Fever Pitch and He's Just Not That Into You. She made her directorial debut with the quirky 2009 sports drama Whip It. And in 2010, she won raves and a Golden Globe for her convincing portrayal of reclusive socialite Little Edie Beale in HBO's Emmy-winning film Grey Gardens, about two eccentric relatives of Jackie Kennedy-Onassis. Off screen, Barrymore has had a high-profile love life, which includes a short-lived marriage to comedian Tom Green, a five-year relationship with Strokes' drummer Fabrizio Moretti, and an on-again, off-again romance with actor Justin Long.Drew Barrymore Fast Facts:
Posed as Marilyn Monroe on the cover of John Kennedy Jr.'s magazine, George, in honor of Bill Clinton's 50th birthday. 
Called a 23-year-old girl who wanted to be on MTV's I Want a Famous Face and convinced her not to have cosmetic surgery to look like her. 
Received a quilt as a birthday gift from her godfather, Steven Spielberg, with the note "Cover yourself up." Also enclosed was a copy of the January 1995 issue of Playboy magazine for which she posed nude. Her pictures were modified by Spielberg's art department so that she was shown fully clothed. 
Received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 3, 2004.Drew Barrymore Relationships: Olive Barrymore Kopelman - DaughterLeland Hayward III - Ex-fiancéFrances Bean Cobain - GodchildFrankie Barrymore Kopelman - DaughterJustin Long - Ex-significant OtherDiana Barrymore - AuntFabrizio Moretti - Ex-significant OtherJessica Barrymore - Half SisterLionel Barrymore - Great-uncleJohn Blyth Barrymore - Half BrotherBlyth Dolores Barrymore - Half SisterJohn Barrymore - GrandfatherEthel Barrymore - Great-auntJaid Barrymore - MotherJeremy Thomas - Ex-husbandJohn Drew Barrymore - FatherDolores Costello - GrandmotherTom Green - Ex-husbandWill Kopelman - HusbandJamie Walters - Ex-fiancéDrew Barrymore Awards: 2009 Screen Actors Guild Awards:  Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries - Winner1985 Golden Globe:  Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture - Nominee2008 People's Choice Awards:  Favorite Leading Lady - Winner2000 Emmy:  Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming More Than One Hour) - Nominee2005 People's Choice Awards:  Favorite On Screen Match Up - Winner1993 Golden Globe:  Best Performance by an Actress in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television - Nominee1982 BAFTA Film Awards:  Outstanding Newcomer to Leading Film Roles - Nominee2010 Golden Globe:  Best Performance by an Actress in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television - Winner2009 Emmy:  Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie - Nominee

She was a modern-day Shirley Temple, but at the age of nine Drew Barrymore was drinking alcohol. At ten she took up marijuana, and by twelve she began snorting cocaine. Here is her gripping, heart-wrenching story--a story of a childhood gone awry and a young woman battling to restore order to her chaotic life.

The first time I read this book I was 14 or so. Being around the same age as Drew Barrymore, I found her life & what she had been through fascinating being so young; just as she was. I always remembered how much I enjoyed the book, so 15 yrs later I looked high & low at the local libraries for a copy & reread it. For me it held up at age 30 just as it had as a teen. Being 15-16 yrs of age when she wrote this, of course her writing skills throughout the book aren't that of her co-writer Todd Gold, but I feel she holds her own. The honesty & open style of her words are what holds the reader's interest. Whether you're a fan of Ms. Barrymore's or not, to read the words of such a young, fragile girl & what her experiences up to that point in her life had been will keep the interest of anyone that is a fan of autobiographies. The  relationship she had with her wannabe actress mother & alcoholic father & the effects it had on her self esteem are something a lot of people can relate to. Not to mention the added attention that was mostly negative from her peers at school because of her success. All in all I feel that this autobiographical account of what can happen to a young person when thrust into the spotlight is a great read. While short in length it is relatable in many ways. Dysfunctional parental relationships, jealousy of success from family & peers, & most of all trying to figure out how to come out on top through it all; which is something most of us strive for.A definite in my top 5 for autobiographies.(less)
A classic of the genre, to be sure. But more than that, a book both formative and prescriptive. I read this as a young teen, and I look back now on the turning of the final page as the moment when my adulthood was forged from the ashes of my youth. My heart cried out for young, tortured Drew; I wrote her a letter (sadly, never sent) that said, in effect: I will love you. I will remain at your side, tho' the wastrel, treacherous Hollywood wolves may lie in wait just outside your door. Allow me th...more

I remember when People magazine did a huge story about her when this came out. My mom let me buy the magazine, and I brought it to school (sixth grade). I think I still have it somewhere at my parents' house.(less)
Update #1:    So far in the book, Drew has talked mainly about her early childhood, her family, and how she got into acting.  Drew comes from a long line of actors who have gotten heavily involved with drugs and alcohol.  Her parents were both actors.  Both her father and her step-brother were drug addicts.  Drew was introduced to acting from her mother.  Her first major film was E.T. which made her famous.  Drew was not prepared for the fame, eventually becoming an alcoholic and drug addict.

Update #1:    So far in the book, Drew has talked mainly about her early childhood, her family, and how she got into acting.  Drew comes from a long line of actors who have gotten heavily involved with drugs and alcohol.  Her parents were both actors.  Both her father and her step-brother were drug addicts.  Drew was introduced to acting from her mother.  Her first major film was E.T. which made her famous.  Drew was not prepared for the fame, eventually becoming an alcoholic and drug addict.  She started writing this book just a few months after getting out of rehab.     This book has yet to really interest me.  Drew hasn't gotten into the specifics of how she got involved with drugs and alcohol at such a young age.  It would be interesting to know this, which I assume she will eventually get to.  The book is somewhat repetitive, making sure the reader knows the loneliness that she felt at the time.  Update #2:     In the part of the book that I've read since my last update, Drew has got into a lot more detail about how and why she got into drugs and alcohol.  Drew had many struggles with feeling accepted.  At school, her peers would make fun of her for not fitting in, then when she tried to fit in, they would make fun of her even more.  She resorted to smoking and drinking to numb herself so she could forget about her problems.  She then got into smoking weed from one of her friend's parents who just gave her weed.  Drew got addicted to how she felt when she smoked weed.  It was the only way she knew how to have fun and get away from her problems.     This book is starting to get better.  With Drew getting more into the details that the reader wants to know, it gets more interesting.  The book has become less repetitive than it was at the beginning.  The writing style is pretty good for a fifteen year old, although she had help from an author.  Update #3:    Recently in the book, Drew was admitted to rehab.  Drew had finally hit rock bottom, being into all sorts of drugs.  Her mom and friends were worried about her so they drove her to a special hospital for addiction.  Drew felt uncomfortable and scared.  She attended multiple counseling sessions a day and met others with the same issues as  her.  Drew felt like she was making a lot of progress there and she didn't want to leave.  She feared relapsing and going back to the same person that she was before.      At this point in the book, the story is pretty interesting.  When Drew talks about how she feels being in rehab, so alone and helpless, the reader can really understand her.  She uses such sensory language that you feel like you're there with her.  So Drew does a really good job of getting the reader to connect with her. Update 4:     At the end of the book, Drew feels that she can finally be herself.  Drew is entering her final weeks of rehab after her relapse.  She has resolved a lot of her issues and is trying her best to become a better person.   This book bored me most of the time.  I would not recommend this book to others.  I think that if I had been through some similar issues to her then I would be more interested in this book.      The author's purpose of writing this novel is to make others aware of the dangers of addiction.  Being addicting to drugs and alcohol, Drew had to go into rehab and was not able to continue to do the one thing that she really loved in life, acting.  When others hear her story, it hopefully makes them stay away from the influence of drugs and alcohol.  The theme of this novel is one should always face their problems instead of running away from them.  Drew's problems of not fitting in and getting bullied were too much for her to handle.  She ran away from her problems by using the influence of drugs and alcohol.  (less)
I was gripped by her tale of getting into and out of addiction.  Although she was only 14 when she wrote the book, it reads as if an adult wrote the account.  She started drinking at age 9, smoking pot at age 10, and sniffing coke by 12.  Barrymore is very candid and vulnerable, with a surprising maturity for such a young age.  She doesn't feel sorry for herself or celebrate her partying days with gratuitous details. Her intention is to explain the difficulties of addiction and try to help others, a...more
I was gripped by her tale of getting into and out of addiction.  Although she was only 14 when she wrote the book, it reads as if an adult wrote the account.  She started drinking at age 9, smoking pot at age 10, and sniffing coke by 12.  Barrymore is very candid and vulnerable, with a surprising maturity for such a young age.  She doesn't feel sorry for herself or celebrate her partying days with gratuitous details. Her intention is to explain the difficulties of addiction and try to help others, as well as to give an honest account before others smeared her name with false assumptions and inaccuracies. Part of it was clearly a career move, but I appreciated it nevertheless, and I thought it was very admirable to provide such an honest and helpful admission. Plus, who better to tell the tale than Drew herself?    Even though it was written many years ago, I think it would benefit both those struggling in addiction as well as the ones who help them.  I particularly enjoyed some of the journals that she shared from rehab, and her changing perceptions of her father.  This piece I related to the most, since at first, she so badly wanted her father to be her hero and a faithful, loving father.  In the end, she had to accept him for who he was, which offered great peace in her life.  It was a good reminder for me about relationships in life. And, even if you aren't struggling with addiction, she still has some great insights about life and people that can apply to anyone.   (less)

I have always liked Drew Barrymore - Even more after knowing more of her struggles. With a famous family like hers, a career that started so young, the drugs so available....
I learned more naughty stuff from this book than Are You There God...?  Loved it as a preteen, I think I checked it out from the library 3 times. 
Someone on a blog I read mentioned this book, so I finally got around to picking it up even though it's very old and very out dated. This is the autobio that Drew Barrymore wrote about herself at like the age of 15 in 1990. It's so weird to think about this now, but she did some horrible shit in the 1980's that most people my age and younger have no idea about. Her mom wanted to be an actress, but since that didn't really work out, she sort of but not really pushed her daughter into it. The whol...more

Her mom wanted to be an actress, but since that didn't really work out, she sort of but not really pushed her daughter into it. The whole relationship was super fucked up. And it's not like Drew didn't go through things that all kids did! We all wanted to be liked and be in a grown-up world when we were kids. The big difference is that our parents said NO and didn't let us, while her mom did. She bottoms out like twice in the book before it ends, so I have no idea what happened after that. I mean, we all know she gets clean because she is like rockin' right now, but between like her bottom out days and like Never Been Kissed and Ever After, which were like her "come back" movies, what happened in between? Oddly, I didn't even look it up because I kind of don't care.I did like the format of this book, alternating between Drew talking and another writer writing about situations from a 3rd person point of view. Gave the whole thing a little more dimension.(less)
I always wondered what the circumstances were that led 9-year-old Drew Barrymore to turn to alcohol and then later drugs. And now I know: a perfect storm combination of depression, insecurity and her inept mother. For some reason Jaid Barrymore thought it a good idea to let a 9-year-old, albeit a precocious one, accompany her to clubs and gave her more social freedom than most parents (including mine) allow for teenagers. So it's no wonder a kid with a family history of depression, alcohol and d...more

So it's no wonder a kid with a family history of depression, alcohol and drug abuse would turn to self-medicating at such a young age. Though this is poorly written, it's a fairly interesting read considering the co-author was 14 years-old at the time. (less)
I was hesitant to read the book at first, not wanting to think of "Gertie" as an underaged drug user and alcoholic.  But the story is more than just that.  Drew goes into the details of her hard and emotionally lacking relationship with her parents, and how she struggles with being honest with sobriety at the tender age of 12.  It's a heart breaking story of a real-life Hollywood child star whose life spirals out of control before barely making it through puberty.
I find drugs fascinating, just like a lot of artsy celebrities do I'm guessing (well I know they do).  But I'm able to read about them and fantasize about them in a therapeutic way. Anyway, it's interesting to me how she did have a good mother, although her father was bad, but Drew seems to be doing well now.  I also liked the different points of view, so I could really understand how drugs/alcohol can shape a person/family.  
Read this as a teen and I should have taken it as a cautionary tale and learned and not repeated her mistakes. Instead however I had to make all my own mistakes and now I think maybe I should have paid more attention to her memoir. It is so crazy since she got sober at like 15 I think that she was able to write a memoir and stay sober so long! Really quite a story and pretty inspiring. 
I have always loved Drew and felt a kinship with her, as I shared some of the same demons as she did. She is a prime example that you can beat any addiction. It's a hard road to go down and she is very honest and raw in this book. She's all grown up and about to produce a new Barrymore of her own. I'm hoping she has broken the family "curse"!! Kudos and congrats, Drew!!!!
I first read this book when I was twelve years old. Yes, I still have it. In fact, I reread it about a year ago. It is still the crappiest autobiography I have ever read, but I can never throw it out. It is like the first tangible symbol of our media culture feeding off celebrities. Also, I like to read about Drew Barrymore getting high. It cracks me up.
I loved that at the end of this book I could fill in the blanks of the next 20 years.  No longer talking to mom, no relapses and a successful actress again.  I wish she'd go back and do an update, of course, if I were Drew, I would want to edit out the pictures of me with the Coreys. 
This was a phenomenal book written by Drew Barrymore. I read this in grade 7 and remember being very impressed with her story. It gave a lot of insight of what she went through as a child star her issues with drugs and how she came through the ordeal. Highly inspiring. 
I have been a huge fan of Drew Barrymore for as long as I can remember.  Her childhood and teenage years were unlike anything most people can imagine.  To make it through all of that and become the incredible person she is now is amazing and inspirational.

Little Girl Lost was a interesting book because you got to see Drew's addiction from her perspective. I have always been a fan of Drew Barrymore, and I was shocked to hear about her substance use at such a young age. This book brought me into that dark place in her life and mind.

I really enjoyed the honesty that was portrayed in this book. She was honest about her attitude, and how poorly she treated some of the people in her life. I was engaged in seeing what kind of decisions she made, and how long it took her to really get clean. Knowing that she obviously cleaned up her act, and is a respectable actress in hollywood, it was interesting to get an insight of her life at this point in time.This is a book recalling real life events in Drew Barrymore's life, and I personally enjoyed it. Prepare to step inside of her state of mind. (less)

Honestly, just trust me me and buy a copy. This book will give you the courage to face up to life's trials. (less)

I have no idea why I read this book. It was somewhat interesting, although not captivating. But I read it and now I know all about Drew Barrymore's childhood. So there.
I always thought the only real prerequisite for writing an autobiography is to have lived a life.  But here we have lil' Drew Barrymore, age 14, writing her life story.  For her age I think she did quite well.  I'm sure she got a smiley face sticker for this in class.  It was co-written by a writer from People Magazine.

Such a hard life for someone so young. By Drew's style of writing you can tell that she had to mature at an early age. A hard story to tell and I'm sure excruciatingly hard to live. 
there was no reason to write this book. drew didn't even have interesting stories to tell, she "interviewed" while another woman put the notes together and wrote the bio (which still did not turn into any fruitful messages).the normal working class girl would have taken these dirty experiences (like sexually pleasing her producer at aged 9) and turned them into something to fight for, fight towards. but what we have here is a prime example of the type of desensitized woman our society produces-...more

Wow, did Drew Barrymore ever have problems! She wrote this book when she was just fourteen and had already been in rehab twice. It makes me respect her a little more, knowing what she overcame to get to where she is. And she's just so likeable and cute. When I first read the book, I couldn't believe a young girl could get into so much trouble, but now, with all the young women in the media for their misbehavior, this book seems to be some kind of warning. 
I thought this book was good.  If you or someone you know has an addiction problem, I actually thought it had some good tips.  I must tell you all this book took me about 3 days longer to read than it should have.  I got down to the last 60 pages and I was determined to finish it and family issues got in the way. Last night, I was going to finish the book, I had 20 pages to go and the power went out!  I guess, I was not meant to finish!
It's hard to imagine that the cute little girl who played in the movie, ET, was drinking alcohol, using marijuana, and snorting cocaine.  Unfortunately, it's a common pattern that we continue to see among Hollywood child actors (i.e., Lindsey Lohan).  Hopefully, by writing this memoir, Drew Barrymore can influence other teenagers not to do drugs.  I thought this was an inspiring book to read!
Keeping in mind this was mostly written by a fourteen year old, it was decent. I quite like Drew Barrymore and the life she used to live is interesting, sad, and hard to believe. Unfortunately young Drew is so bratty and obnoxious that it's hard to relate or empathize with her. I empathized more with her mother Jaid, despite her questionable parenting. 
   Knowing what Drew has done career-wise from when the book was published to now is an inspiration and example of survival, inner strength and courage. I don't know her personally but I'm proud of her, especially at how young she still is. You'd think she was 60 years old. Can't wait to see Drew's next chapters in her life.
