Andrew Wegman Bird (born July 11, 1973) is an American musician, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist.
Trained in the Suzuki method from the age of four,[1] Bird graduated from Lake Forest High School in 1991 and Northwestern University with a bachelor's degree in violin performance in 1996. That same year he self-released his first solo album, Music of Hair. Vastly different from his later work, this album showcased his violin skills and paid tribute to his fascination with both American and European folk traditions, as well as jazz and blues. Following this, his initial commercial exposure came through collaborative work with the band Squirrel Nut Zippers, appearing on three of their albums (Hot, Sold Out, and Perennial Favorites) between 1996 and 1998.
Taking on the role of bandleader, Bird released Thrills on Rykodisc in 1998 with his group Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire, shortly followed by second album Oh! The Grandeur in 1998. Both albums were heavily influenced by traditional folk, pre-war jazz, and swing, with Bird relying on the violin as his primary musical instrument, as well as providing vocals along with his trademark verbose lyrics. The Bowl of Fire featured musicians from Bird's home town of Chicago, including Kevin O'Donnell, Joshua Hirsch, Nora O'Connor, Andy Hopkins, Jimmy Sutton, Colin Bunn, and Ryan Hembrey. During this period, Andrew Bird was a member of the jazz group Kevin O'Donnells Quality Six, for which he was the lead singer and violinist and contributed to arrangements and songwriting for the albums Heretic Blues (Delmark 1999) and Control Freak (Delmark 2000) (both Delmark albums were produced by Raymond Salvatore Harmon).
In 2001, the Bowl of Fire released their third album, The Swimming Hour, a dramatic departure from their previous recordings. It featured a mixture of styles, from the zydeco-influenced "Core and Rind" to more straightforward rock songs such as "11:11". Due to this eclectic nature, Bird has often referred to it as his "jukebox album". Although gaining critical praise (The Swimming Hour received a 9.0 from indie music website Pitchfork[2]), the band failed to attain commercial success or recognition, playing to audiences as small as 40 people.[3] In 2002, Bird was asked to open for a band in his hometown of Chicago, but fellow Bowl of Fire members were unavailable for the date. The reluctant Bird performed the gig alone, and the surprising success of this solo show suggested potential new directions for his music.[3]
The Bowl of Fire unofficially disbanded in 2003, and Bird went on to radically re-invent himself as a solo artist. His two subsequent albums were released on Ani Difranco's Righteous Babe Records label. 2003's Weather Systems (originally released on Grimsey Records) was a sparse record with a dramatic change in musical direction. It featured the tracks "Skin, Is My" and "I", proto-versions of songs that would later become "Skin" (The Mysterious Production of Eggs) and "Imitosis" (Armchair Apocrypha).
The Mysterious Production of Eggs (2005) continued a progression towards an eclectic indie–folk sound, and both records formed a stark stylistic break with Bird's earlier work, swapping the lush backing of a full band for carefully layered samples of sound constructed using multitrack recorders and loop pedals. As his sound changed, Bird made increasing use of guitar, glockenspiel, and whistling in his songwriting, in addition to his traditional violin and vocals.
Bird is noted for improvising and reworking his songs during live performance, as can be seen in his series of self-released live compilations entitled Fingerlings, Fingerlings 2, Fingerlings 3, and Fingerlings 4, the first of which was released in 2002. Each Fingerlings EP was released prior to a studio album, and presented a mixture of live performances from different shows, including old tracks, covers, and previously unreleased songs, some of which have since appeared on studio albums. Fingerlings 3, released in October 2006, also featured studio outtakes. Fingerlings 2 provided Bird with an unexpected boost in recognition in 2004 when it was named album of the month by Mojo.[1]
In 2005, co-collaborator Martin Dosh joined Bird's line-up, adding percussion and keyboards to his sound.[1] Jeremy Ylvisaker was later added to the group on bass and backup vocals.
In September 2006, Bird signed to Fat Possum Records, and in March 2007 he released his third post-Bowl of Fire album, Armchair Apocrypha.[4] The album was recorded in collaboration with electronic musician Martin Dosh, and includes a track composed by Dosh (with lyrics by Bird) entitled "Simple X". This song first appeared without Bird's lyrics as "Simple Exercises" on Dosh's 2004 release Pure Trash. The album was produced by Ben Durrant (who had worked on Dosh's The Lost Take), and also featured Haley Bonar and Chris Morrissey.[5] In advance of the March release date, Armchair Apocrypha was leaked to the Internet in January 2007. The album went on to sell over 100,000 copies.[1]
As publicity for Armchair Apocrypha, Bird made his network television debut on April 10, 2007, performing "Plasticities" (from the new album) on the Late Show with David Letterman. He also appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien on June 14, 2007, performing "Imitosis" from the same album. In April 2007, he did a Take-Away Show acoustic video session shot by Vincent Moon. These appearances were accompanied by an extensive tour, which ended with sell-out performances at the Beacon Theater, New York and the Orpheum Theater, Los Angeles.[1]
In January 2007, Bird made an appearance on the Noggin television network's Jack's Big Music Show, playing the part of Dr. Stringz and appearing in order to mend a character's broken dulcimer. Bird sang a brief song called "Dr. Stringz", written specially for the show. He now often plays it live as an introduction to the song "Fake Palindromes".[6][7]
On May 20, 2007, National Public Radio aired a live concert by Bird from Washington, D.C.'s 9:30 Club[8] He also worked with Reverb, a non-profit environmental organization, for his 2007 spring tour.[9]
Five of his songs – "Banking on a Myth" from "The Mysterious Production of Eggs," a medley of "I" from Weather Systems and "Imitosis" from "Armchair Apocrypha," and "Skin" and "Weather Systems" from Weather Systems – have been licensed for use by Marriott Residence Inn.[10]
Since March 2008, Bird has contributed to "Measure for Measure,"[11] a New York Times blog in which musicians write about their songwriting process. In it, he has charted the development of the song "Oh No," previewing samples at various stages of development through to the finished album recording. He also discussed the conception of the song "Natural Disaster," the recording of instrumental piece "Hot Math," and previewed "Master Sigh." The first two songs were later released on Bird's 2009 album "Noble Beast," whilst the latter two appeared on its bonus disc "Useless Creatures."[12]
In December 2008, he appeared in the second series of Nigel Godrich's From the Basement alongside Radiohead and Fleet Foxes. His performance included a preview of new song "Section 8 City," a ten minute re-imagining of "Sectionate City," which originally appeared on the "Soldier On EP."[13]
Bird's fifth solo album, "Noble Beast," was released on January 20, 2009, and contained fourteen new songs, with bonus tracks available for download from iTunes and eMusic. "The Privateers" is a re-imagining of a very early song entitled "The Confession" from 1999's "Oh! The Grandeur."[1] A limited deluxe edition of the album included alternate packaging and artwork, as well as an all-instrumental companion disc entitled "Useless Creatures." The entirety of "Useless Creatures" was made available via Bird's website during the run-up to the release. "Noble Beast" has been met with generally favourable reviews, receiving a score of 79 out of 100 from review collation site Metacritic.[14]
In 2009, he contributed a cover of the song "The Giant of Illinois" to the HIV and AIDS benefit album "Dark Was the Night" produced by the Red Hot Organization. On May 11, 2009, Bird released the EP "Fitz and the Dizzy Spells." It contains "Fitz and the Dizzyspells" from "Noble Beast," as well as other songs from that album's recording sessions. Some of the songs on the EP were previously available for download from iTunes and eMusic as bonus tracks to "Noble Beast."
In 2010, Bird recorded with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, contributing vocals and violin on a cover of "Shake It and Break It" on "Preservation: An Album to Benefit Preservation Hall & The Preservation Hall Music Outreach Program."
Bird currently uses custom-made Schroeder amplifiers.[15] He also uses his signature horn speakers by Specimen Products on stage.
In August, 2010, Bird contributed a charity t-shirt to the Yellow Bird Project to raise money for the Pegasus Special Riders Fund, which provides therapeutic horse riding activities for adults and children with special needs.[16]
In late 2011 Bird signed to the record label Mom + Pop Music. Andrew Bird's first release for the label was the soundtrack to the film Norman, which included his original score as well as songs by other artists.[17] Bird sequenced the soundtrack to flow as a stand-alone album rather than a compilation of music from the film.[17] Its music supervisor, Peymon Maskan, told HitQuarters: "The best compliment I've heard is that without having seen the film, you can imagine it by listening to the soundtrack. The sequence is a big part of that effect."[17]
On December 6, Bird announced a new album Break it Yourself, the follow up to 2009's Noble Beast.[18]
In 2011 "Andrew Bird: Fever Year", a feature-length concert documentary on Bird's year-long tour, had its World Premiere at Lincoln Center with the prestigious New York Film Festival. The film's festival-only run closed in 2013 after screening in over ninety international festivals and winning nine awards. "Fever Year" depicts Bird and his band during final months of a tour during which he reportedly suffered from constant fever. When asked on her website if the film will be released on DVD, director Xan Aranda[19] stated that the film was commissioned by and belongs to Bird, thus the release is up to him to decide. Andrew Bird: Fever Year also features Martin Dosh, Michael Lewis, Jeremy Ylvisaker, and St. Vincent (Annie Clark).
In September 2012, Bird announced Hands Of Glory, a companion EP to Break it Yourself.[20] The album was released on October 30.
Growing up, Bird was surrounded by classical music. As a child, he was interested in Irish tunes and bluegrass. He also cites English and Scottish folk music as an early influence.[21] His early jazz influences were Johnny Hodges, Lester Young, and Fats Waller.[22][23] He has also had a number of classical influences such as Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Béla Bartók.[24] Other influences included jazz, swing, calypso, and folk. Bird has stated that, at 22, he found a lot of indie rock and pop music repetitive and boring, but now understands it better.[25]

Chicago singer/songwriter/violinist Andrew Bird updates the traditions of small-group swing, German lieder, and New Orleans jazz, mixing Gypsy, folk, and rock elements into his distinctive style. Bird's projects include his group the Bowl of Fire (which also includes drummer Kevin O'Donnell, bassist Josh Hirsch, and guitarist Colin Bunn) and performing as an auxiliary member of the Squirrel Nut Zippers; in turn, the Zippers' Katharine Whalen and James Mathus appeared on the Bowl of Fire albums Thrills and Oh! the Grandeur. Bird has also recorded with artists like Pinetop Seven and Lil' Ed Williams, teaches music at the Old Town School of Folk Music, and performed on the score and soundtrack from the 1999 Tim Robbins film The Cradle Will Rock.
His third album, 2001's The Swimming Hour, surprisingly found the Bowl of Fire turning to pop music, and with excellent results. As bandmembers remained active in their various other projects, the group continued, and work on a follow-up began in 2002. To tide fans over, Bird self-released a limited-edition EP, Fingerlings, which documented live performances of some old and new songs by the band and solo. Early 2003 brought the release of another LP, Weather Systems, on the independent Grimsey label. Bird debuted on Ani DiFranco's Righteous Babe imprint in 2005 with Andrew Bird & the Mysterious Production of Eggs. He switched to Fat Possum for 2007's Armchair Apocrypha and 2009's Noble Beast, both of which were ambitious and eclectic albums even by Bird's standards. The latter of the two was also available in a deluxe version that included a bonus CD of instrumental works. The second disc, dubbed Useless Creatures, was released independently from its predecessor in October of 2010.
The following year, Bird composed the score for Jonathan Segal's independent coming-of-age film Norman. The film's score was released in October on the Mom + Pop label. Bird's highly anticipated sixth studio album, Break it Yourself, arrived in March of 2012, followed by the companion piece Hands of Glory in early October.

A Nervous Tic Motion Of The Head To The Left (a witty catalog of vocal and instrumental violations of the rules of pop songwriting),
Bird has un uncanny sense of how to remodel the old-fashioned (the bucolic whistling in the Donovan-esque Masterfade,
Il violinista di Chicago Andrew Bird, che aveva suonato con gli Squirrel Nut Zippers, debuttò da solista con Music of Hair (1996). 
I suoi album con i Bowl of Fire (il cui leader era il batterista jazz  Kevin O'Donnell) offrono un brillante mix di cabaret, musica da ballo, jump blues, Appalachian folk, swing e easy listening orchestrale: Thrills (1998) e Oh The Grandeur (1999), con Candy Shop. The Swimming Hour (2001) segnò lapice formale della band (specie Nora O'Connor nei cori), che indulgeva al garage-rock (Two Way Action), al blues (Why?),  alla musica caraibica (11:11), al  rhythm'n'blues (How Indiscreet), alla ballata orchestrale (Dear Old Greenland), o a brevi canzoni come Way Out West e Waiting to Talk. 
Lo spartano mini-album Weather Systems (2003) fallì nellintrodurre nuovi elementi, e infatti ridusse la gamma stilistica rispetto allalbum precedente, offrendo comunque la cupa meditazione Waitsiana I e la litania alla Mark Kozelek Lull. 
Bird tornò al sound dei Bowl of Fire col vortice stilistico di The Mysterious Production Of Eggs (2005), una collezione di canzoni eleganti e orecchiabili (A Nervous Tic Motion Of The Head To The Left, The Naming of Things, Fake Palindromes) che sembrano la sintesi definitiva del decennio. Will Oldham è il trovatore dellalt-country, Jeff Buckley è stato profondo psicologo, Devendra Banhart garbato bardo psichedelico, Rufus Wainwright sofisticato artigiano del pop. Andrew Bird è tutte queste cose insieme: maestro del canto profondo, degli arrangiamenti, dellimmaginario lirico, delle melodie celestiali, della bizzarria e della delicatezza.
The nine-minute four-movement Carrion Suite, featuring Wilco's drummer Glenn Kotche and jazz bassist Todd Sickafoose, is much more psychological, a
Lequilibrio fra voce e musica rimane il pregio principale di Bird su Armchair Apocrypha (Fat Possum, 2007). Ciò viene dimostrato meglio con la pianistica Armchairs (7 minuti) e lorecchiabile  Plasticities (con violino, xilofono e theremin), ma pervade in definitiva ogni motivetto dellalbum, da Fiery Crash a Dark Matter. Essendo padrone sia dellorchestrazione (per gentile concessione del tastierista Martin Dosh e del multistrumentista Jeremy Ylvisaker) che della voce, la sintesi di Bird è più efficace che mai. Lossessionante strumentale Yawny at the Apocalypse non è solo la proverbiale ciliegina sulla torta ma anche un muto epitaffio sulla visione solenne di Bird.
Noble Beast (Fat Possum, 2009), equamente suddiviso tra canzoni e brani strumentali, e austero, idiosincratico, impressionistico pop da camera per esperienze traumatiche, cesellato attraverso una meticolosa sintassi di sottigliezze subliminali. Dopo lastratta apertura strumentale raga-psichedelica Master Sigh, la transizione dalla melodia pop Oh No, che suona come Elton John con la chitarra, alla cullante ed evocativa Effigy a la Leonard Cohen (con violini al tempo di valzer e cori femminili) emerge come la transizione da uno stato fisico ad uno metafisico. In un certo senso, la piu lunga Masterswarm opera la trasformazione inversa allinterno di una sola canzone, dal suo iniziale inno tinto dIndia al tema caraibico da easy-listening che segue. Not A Robot But A Ghost segue la strada al contrario: da effervescente danza caraibica a rapimento astrale. Lo strumentale da sette minuti You Woke Me Up sovrappone uno schema neoclassico ad uno mediorientale e turbinante. Mentre la facciata power pop edonistica procede, le dinamiche e i paesaggi sonori retro-creativi di Fitz And The Dizzyspells allestiscono un teatro della memoria per un pubblico di amnesiaci. Laspetto piu meditativo delle canzoni raggiunge un picco con la pensosa vignetta country-rock influenzata da Morricone di Tenuousness e con la lunga elegia Souverian che si rifa alle odi di Jackson Browne.
Il mix di elementi retro ed esotici e il responsabile della forma creativa di easy-listening strumentale di Andrew Bird, esemplificata da Nyatiti. Allaltra estremita dello spettro strumentale Bird si avventura addirittura nelle musiche ambientale e concreta con i crescendo droneggianti di The Barn Tapes (dieci minuti). Carrion Suite (dieci minuti e quattro movimenti), col batterista dei WIlco Glenn Kotche e il contrabbassista jazz Todd Sickafoose, e ben piu psicologica, un esemplare di astratto jazz etnico post-industriale da camera. La sua piu aspra controparte e Hot Math (sette minuti), un mix di minimalismo ripetitivo e funk etnico. E la meta strumentale del disco doppio a prevalere. Vi compaiono anche il lamentoso e cacofonico adagio di Dissent e il demenziale concerto per fischi di Sigh Master. Ognuna potrebbe fungere da blocco di partenza per album piu ambiziosi.

Andrew Bird (born July 11, 1973) is an American musician. He was born in Lake Bluff, Illinois and resides in the Chicago area. Bird is a singer, a violinist and, since 2004, a guitarist. He is also an accomplished whistler.
His early work, which echoed gypsy jazz and traditional folk, has led into his current sound, which mixes rock with more broad compositions. His years of solo song-craft have now enabled him to produce a sound that is uniquely his own.
Trained by the Suzuki method from a young age and a graduate of Illinois’ Northwestern University, Bird released his first solo album, Music of Hair, in  1996. Vastly different from his later releases, this first album showcases his violin skills and pays tribute to his fascination with both American and European folk traditions, as well as jazz and blues.
His initial commercial exposure was in collaborative work with the band Squirrel Nut Zippers. He was quickly lumped in with the swing craze that swept the United States music industry in the mid ’90s; this is an affiliation that he is still working to shed.
Taking on the role of band leader in 1997 with Andrew Bird’s Bowl of Fire, he released the album Thrills. This was followed by Oh! The Grandeur in 1998. Both albums were heavily influenced by traditional folk, pre-war jazz and swing, with Bird relying on the violin as his primary musical instrument.
In 2001, Bird released The Swimming Hour, his third release with the Bowl of Fire and a dramatic departure from previous recordings. The Swimming Hour featured a mixture of styles, from the zydeco-influenced “Core and Rind” to more straightforward rock songs. He has often referred to this record as his “jukebox album”.
The Bowl of Fire unofficially disbanded some time in 2003, having featured many skilled Chicago musicians including Kevin O’Donnell, Nora O’Connor, Andy Hopkins (aka Mr. Rudy Day), Jimmy Sutton, Colin Bunn and Ryan Hembrey.
Bird then released two subsequent solo albums, both distributed through the label operated by Ani DiFranco, Righteous Babe Records. The two records, 2003’s Weather Systems and 2005’s The Mysterious Production of Eggs, continue a progression towards an eclectic indie folk sound that has proven challenging to classify.
Bird’s live solo shows have been notable in that he uses a multi-track system to sample and loop his own performance. For example, he may record a snippet of his performance on violin, then play a “loop” of that sound. This provides a more full-bodied sound and aurally suggests a band performance, rather than the sound of a solo artist.
November 2007 saw the Soldier On EP originally a European tour-only release. But due to high demand and unanticipated critical acclaim was released digitally and in CD-format on both sides of the Atlantic. Critics and fans alike have hearkened to the EP’s first track, “The Trees Were Mistaken”, a complex yet austere looping composition that marks a departure from Bird’s earlier body of work. It also contains a cover of Bob Dylan’s “Oh Sister”.
January 2009 saw Noble Beast, also available with instrumental album Useless Creatures, released worldwide to positive reviews.
The Fatal Shore Songfacts reports that Break it Yourself, Bird’s sixth solo studio album, was released on March 6, 2012 through Mom+Pop records in the US and Bella Union in the UK. The origins of the LP lie in a couple of jam sessions by a gathering of Bird’s friends in the singer’s western Illinois barn, near the banks of the Mississippi River.

The self-produced album consists of 14 original songs recorded primarily at the Beech House in Nashville, with additional recording taking place at various Chicago and Minneapolis locations over a period of five months.

Two New York shows sell out within two hours.March 26, 2008 - Bird begins documenting the conception and creation of the song "Oh No" on the New York Times' Measure for Measure blog.

THE NEW YORKER calls the album "a vast, optimistic album about depressing things such as falling airplanes and empires, NEWSWEEK says "just the right parts darkness and light," while THE NEW YORK TIMES notes "Mr. Bird spins existential doubts into elegant confections." Armchair Apocrypha goes on to sell over 100,000 copies as Bird makes his debuts on THE LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN and LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN, followed by a triumphant tour culminating in sold out performances at the Beacon Theater in New York and the Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles, and featuring appearances at Coachella, the Austin City Limits festival, the Hollywood Bowl and Bumbershoot, as well as over 100 of his own dates in between, without ever playing the same set--or the same arrangement of any song, for that matter.January 2007 - Bird appears on the Noggin network's JACK'S BIG MUSIC SHOW as "Dr. Stringz" and performs a song written specifically for his character and scene. 2006 - Fingerlings 3 is released.

Comprised of live solo, duo, and band performances, including aversion of "Sovay" with My Morning Jacket backing Bird, it unexpectedly becomes album of the month in MOJO, who exclaim “Bird is extraordinary live.” Bird tours virtually non-stop throughout 2003-2004, honing his solo show and working out his unique looping technique.June 10, 2003 - Weather Systems is released, featuring the Bird classic "Lull" as well as "I" and "Skin" which evolve respectively into Armchair Apocrypha's "Imitosis" and The Mysterious Production of Eggs' "Skin Is, My."October 2002 - Fingerlings is released.

The Grandeur, the second Bowl of Fire record, is released on Rykodisc. It features "The Confession," which has since been re-imagined as Noble Beast's "The Privateers”, with Loney Dear serving as Bird's backing band on the new version.April 7, 1998 - Thrills, the debut album from Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire, is released on Rykodisc.Sometime in 1996 - Andrew Bird graduates from Northwestern with a bachelors degree in violinperformance and self-releases the Music of Hair album.Sometime in 1977 - A four-year-old Andrew Bird picks up his first violin at the age of 4.

So begins a formative period soaking up classical repertoire completely by ear followed by a teenage expansion into Hungarian Gypsy music, early jazz, country blues, South Indian music and more, as well as the discovery of an uncanny whistling ability.
