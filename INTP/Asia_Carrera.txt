=======================================================
Asia Carrera (born Jessica Steinhauser[1] on August 6, 1973) is an American former pornographic actress.[2]
Asia Carrera was born in New York City to a Japanese father and German mother,[3] the eldest of four siblings.[4] She was raised in Little Silver, New Jersey, attending the Little Silver School District and Red Bank Regional High School. She studied piano as a child and performed at Carnegie Hall twice before the age of 15.[2] At the age of 16, she taught English at Tsuruga College in Japan.[2][5]
She was awarded a full academic scholarship to Rutgers University, where she majored in Japanese and Business but from which she did not graduate,[2][6][7] and is a member of Mensa,[2][5][8] with an IQ of 156.[9]
Carrera's adult film career ran from 1993 to 2003 and included over 400 films and video features.[10] According to interviews, she chose her stage name surname from actress Tia Carrere, changing the spelling for legal reasons.[11]
Carrera was the first Asian performer ever to win the award AVN Female Performer of the Year Award.[12]
Carrera lent her voice to several erotic hentai OVAs for publisher Pink Pineapple, such as Inmu (2001)[13] and Shusaku (1999).[14] In October 2001, Carrera attended the Big Apple Anime Fest in New York City for her voice roles and along with Kobe Tai was an Opening Night Guest of Honor at the fest's Midnight Anime Concourse.[15]
Carrera was also in the 2010 documentary After Porn Ends, which is about life after being a porn actor.[16]
In 2011, Complex magazine ranked her at #5 in their list of “The Top 50 Hottest Asian Porn Stars of All Time.”[17]
In 1998, she appeared in an uncredited cameo role in the film The Big Lebowski in the faux pornographic movie Logjammin' within the film.[18][19]
Carrera was featured in the book Part Asian, 100% Hapa by artist Kip Fulbeck. She also provided one of three featured quotes on the book jacket.
After growing tired of impostors claiming to be her on MySpace, Carrera posted her own authentic profile.[21]
Carrera is an avid player of Unreal Tournament. She designed her own game skins and was featured in the show Players on the G4 games cable channel, where she revealed that her screen name is "Megabitchgoddess." Carrera hosted her own Unreal Tournament server that featured custom maps designed by fans who frequented the chatroom that she has hosted on her site since 1997.[citation needed]
She identified investor Warren Buffett as her hero on her website,[22] which Buffett was pleased to learn.[23]
In September 1995, Carrera married adult film director Bud Lee. They divorced in 2003, but remain good friends.[2] Carrera dated a former grip from her porn sets for a few years until his visa expired and he returned to England. She married nutritionist and author Don Lemmon on December 19, 2003.[2] The couple moved to St. George, Utah, where Carrera gave birth to her first daughter, Catalina, on March 4, 2005.[2][25] Lemmon was killed in a car accident near Las Vegas on June 10, 2006. At the time, Carrera was almost eight months pregnant with their second child.[26] Concerned about her livelihood and worries of not being able to support her two children on her own, Carrera began to solicit donations on her personal web site.[27][28] Eventually, Carrera got a message from an insurance company that a life insurance policy she had forgotten about did exist for her husband, and she was granted it after mandatory investigation.[28]
On May 13, 2007, she announced on her website that she had filed a request to legally change her son's name to Devin D'Artagnan Lemmon, in honor of Devin DeVasquez, the woman who first introduced her to Donald. She explained that "He's not Don, he never will be Don, and it made me want to start crying every time a random stranger would say, 'Oh he's so cute, what's his name?'" The state made an error in changing his name, however, keeping the "III".[29]
On April 14, 2010, Carrera confessed on her blog that she became an alcoholic after the death of her husband, Donald, that she had joined Alcoholics Anonymous, and was in her third week of sobriety. She emphasized that she still did not believe in God, and that it is "actually not mandatory for joining AA."[30]
In 2006, Carrera was asked for commentary by The Spectrum, a St. George, Utah-area newspaper, on the local case of Susan Russell, who was charged with 15 counts of third-degree felony distribution of pornographic material. Russell allegedly sold pornographic materials and sex toys from a back room in her Earrings and More store, potentially violating the "community standards" of the Mormon-dominated town per the Supreme Court case Miller v. California. Carrera opined:
"I deliberately moved to St. George with my husband so we could raise our kids in a conservative atmosphere, in a low-crime, family friendly state. I do appreciate that the laws are there, and will make it harder for my kids to get into trouble when they get older."
"Do I have a problem with porn being sold here? No, not per se. I have no problem with porn at all. Trust me, they don't exploit women, and watching porn has never been scientifically shown to lead to any increase in crime rates, be it rape, pedophilia, or any other sexual crimes."
Nevertheless, she reiterated that the community's conservatism was the reason she moved there, and that she had no plans to challenge it.[31]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Asia Carrera's stunning curves can be seen in more than 250 hardcore movies. Her looks combine delicate Asian features with voluptuous silicone breasts. Her fans not only admire her mouth-watering body but also her brains--a self-taught web designer, she is also a member of MENSA.At the tender age of 13 this daughter of a German father and a Japanese mother already was already playing music by Johann Sebastian Bach on the piano in Carnegie Hall. Thanks to a federal grant she was able to study Japanese language and Economics at New Jersey's Rutgers University, but this was only after she had run away from home as a teenager because of the pressure her demanding parents put on her. By the age of 17 she was homeless. To get through her studies at the university she turned to stripping. After becoming one of New Jersey's best-paid exotic dancers she decided to devote her life to getting richer and richer; she never wanted to live out on the street again. When she heard about girls making thousands of dollars in the porn biz, she moved to Los Angeles. A mutual friend introduced her to director Bud Lee, who instantly put her in one of his feature films. The rest, as they say, is history.Asia has retired from making adult movies and only returns to do the occasional big-budget flick. She runs her own website and spends her time chatting with fans via email or day trading shares on the stock exchange.
      With an IQ of 156, she is a member of MENSA, an international organization of about 100,000 highly intelligent people whose IQs rank in the top 2 percent of the world's population.
      Her husband, nutritionist-author Don Lemmon, died in a tragic car accident on 10 June 2006, 7 weeks before their second child was born.
      2nd child, son Donald Edward Lemmon III was born on July 31, 2006 by unassisted home birth. He weighed 8 pounds, 10 ounces.
      Announced that she and husband Don are expecting a second baby, due in August 2006. [November 2005]
      I've always been an atheist. Science explains everything. There is no meaning in life except to be the best at something. If only I could be the best at something, perhaps my parents would love me.
      Religion is silly. When you're dead, you turn into a source for future flowers and plants . . . I don't know what's on the other side of death and it scares me. Darkness and nothingness scare me. I'd rather face the miseries of my day-to-day life than turn into darkness.

Wikimedia CommonsSome children of so-called “Tiger Moms” grow up to be smug, arrogant,  and delusional Professors at Yale.  Others run away from home before  they even start college (on full scholarship, of course) to do porn.  Amy Chua is one the former.  Asia Carrera is one the latter.
Chinese parents believe that they know what is best for  their children and therefore override all of their children’s own  desires and preferences. That’s why Chinese daughters can’t have  boyfriends in high school and why Chinese kids can’t go to sleepaway  camp. It’s also why no Chinese kid would ever dare say to their mother,  “I got a part in the school play! I’m Villager Number Six. I’ll have to  stay after school for rehearsal every day from 3:00 to 7:00, and I’ll  also need a ride on weekends.” God help any Chinese kid who tried that  one.
The only remotely-sane part of the “Tiger Mom” approach espoused by  Chua and her ilk that is that it’s often (if not always) better for  parents to push their kids to acheive, but there’s a freakin’ limit, one  of which she is painfully unaware!  Her style of parenting is exactly  what led brilliant (MENSA brilliant) child prodigy Asia Carrera to run  away from home and pursue a career of getting paid for sex.
I’m pretty sure few – if any – Tiger Mothers want their sons or  daughters to be porn stars, yet it seems very few – Chua especially –  fail to comprehend the real dangers of pushing your children too-hard  and controlling every aspect of their lives.
Luckily, Asia Carrera has been kind enough to share her story in the FAQs on her site, which should serve as a lesson for all current and future/aspiring Tiger Moms, emphasis mine:
'I get this question from concerned parents fairly frequently, and my  immediate response is this – “the fact that you’re even writing to me to  address this issue means that you’re aware of a potential problem, and  taking steps to prevent it, which puts you miles ahead of the game  already!” I get tons of commiserating e-mails from bright young people  my age, (mostly asians) whose parents also pushed them far beyond the  limits of what should be expected from children. Some are still  struggling to live up to their parents demands, writing to me from  prestigious universities, where they were on their way to becoming  doctors and lawyers, and some of the letters were from unfortunate souls  who had snapped under the pressure, and either broken off contact with  their families, or run away from home, like I did.
The sad thing about all these e-mails is that neither group  seems to have found any happiness, because the kids who are pleasing  their parents are resentful, wishing they’d followed their own dreams,  and those who DID leave home wonder sadly if their stubborn independence  was worth turning their backs on their family for…
It’s a no-win situation for the kids, so it’s up to the  PARENTS to prevent it from happening! Parents, of course you want your  kids to do the best they can, and when you have an exceptionally bright  child, that urge to push them towards success gets even stronger. But  please remember that your kids are just that – KIDS, and they need to  have time to play, grow up, and experience a childhood too! They’re not  little adults who agree that “sacrificing playtime is imperative in the  quest for ivy league college acceptance”, and even though you WILL know  better as the adult, sometimes you have to step back and let them learn  things on their own, and make some mistakes on their own.
Try to point them in the right direction, without  subconsciously forcing them down the path that you’ve decided they  should take. The bottom line  is, which is more of a success story in the end – A kid who’s been  coerced into med school and a huge future paycheck, while resenting his  parents for killing his dream of being an artist/musician/etc…. or a kid  who’s struggling to succeed in a field he loves, with a supportive,  loving family behind him 100%?
Why am I writing this and what on earth does it have to do with Finance/economics/the normal stuff I write?
My Idol –  Warren Buffett! *sigh*… Warren is the  legendary financial genius behind the most expensive stock in the world,  Berkshire Hathaway. He was the richest man in America before Bill  Whats-his-name and the Silicon Valley geeks took over, yet he’s always  remained a modest and down-to-earth kinda guy. For years, I invested  only in mutual funds, but finally I gathered the courage to buy some  baby Berkshire shares right before the tech collapse. Go Warren!
I don’t know how to contact Asia (nor do I care what her real name  is, but that’s another story), but if I could, I’d ask her to join the  Stone Street Advisors team.  I’d tell her to get into Stocktwits and investing, and use that big beautiful…brain to analyze and trade, and to share her thoughts with the world here and on ST!
Alas, I do not have her contact info, but if anyone does, please  forward this to her and ask her to get in touch, as I think it would be  great for all of us!

=======================================================
Asia Carrera (born Jessica Steinhauser on August 6, 1973 in New York City) is a former American pornographic actress.
Asia Carrera was born in New York City to a Japanese father and German mother and is the oldest of four siblings. She was raised in Little Silver, New Jersey, attending Little Silver Public Schools and Red Bank Regional High School.
She studied piano as a child, and performed at Carnegie Hall twice before the age of 15. By 16 she taught English at Tsuruga College in Japan. When she was 17, she ran away from home because she felt her parents put too much pressure on her to succeed academically.
Carrera worked during the early 1990s as a dancer at several go-go bars in her home state of New Jersey.
After doing at least one photoshoot for an adult magazine, she put together a demo porn tape in 1993. At the end of that year she relocated to California to break into the pornography business and she announced her retirement at the end of 2003. She is sometimes credited as Asia or Jessica Bennett.
Carrera has also been involved in writing, producing, and directing movies, as well as doing all her own make-up and hair-styling, and doing much of the hair and make-up for other actresses in the same movies.
As is common practice among adult film actresses, the name “Asia Carrera” is a pseudonym. According to interviews, she chose the stage name surname from actress Tia Carrere, intentionally misspelling it for legal reasons.
After her contract with Vivid expired in the mid 1990s, Carrera had her right labia minora pierced and has henceforth had a variety of 1/2″ gold rings affixed there ever since. At this time she also had her first breast enlargement, going from a medium B to at least a full C cup. She has had at least one subsequent breast surgery and is now a D cup or larger.
Carrera performed only a few anal sex scenes during her career because she didn’t want to be considered an “anal queen”. Her first scene in the movie A is for Asia (a film to which she owned all the rights) which occurred after her contract with Vivid finished.
Carrera has an active presence on the Internet and describes herself as “the nerd of porn”. She proudly proclaims that she created her own Web site in the late 1990s, including writing the code and editing the pictures.
She is also an avid player of Unreal Tournament. She designed her own game skins and was featured in the show Players on the G4 games cable channel, where she revealed that her screen name is “Megabitchgoddess.” Carrera hosted her own Unreal Tournament server that featured custom maps designed by fans that frequented the chatroom that she has hosted on her site since 1997. She is also a Corvette aficionado but traded hers in after starting a family.
In 1995, Carrera married adult film director Bud Lee. They divorced in 2003 after a long separation, but continue to remain good friends. Carrera dated Clarke, a former grip from her porn sets, for a few years until his visa expired and he returned to England. Soon after, she married nutritionist and author Don Lemmon on December 19, 2003. The couple moved to St. George, Utah where Carrera gave birth to her first daughter, Catalina, on March 4, 2005.
While she was almost 8 months pregnant with their second baby, Don was killed in a car accident near Las Vegas on June 10, 2006. In an expression of concern about her livelihood and worries of not being able to support their two children on her own, Carrera began to solicit donations on her personal web site. Eventually, though, Carrera got a message from an insurance company that a life insurance policy she had forgotten about did exist for her husband and after mandatory investigation she was granted it and thus announced that the financial crisis was over.
Their son, who was born on July 31, 2006, was initially to be named Devin; but she decided, after Lemmon’s death, to name him Donald Edward Lemmon III. She gave birth to her son at home unassisted. She and Don had planned for the birth to be unassisted, but after his death she was offered free midwifery services; she was unsure whether she wanted to give birth alone without her husband. The birth occurred 11 days before the estimated due date, while a midwife was en route.
On May 13, 2007, she announced on her web site that she had filed a request to legally change her son’s name to Devin D’Artagnan Lemmon, in honor of Devin DeVasquez, the woman who first introduced her to Donald. She explained that “He’s not Don, he never will be Don, and it made me want to start crying every time a random stranger would say, ‘Oh he’s so cute, what’s his name?’” The state however made an error in changing his name and kept the “III” after his name. 
On March 18, 2007 she announced on her Blog that once her merchandise inventory is gone she “will probably” shut down her website. “I’ve got to give my kids their anonymity. I need to back away from being famous so my kids can grow up without being ostracized by their peers for who their mommy was.”
In 2006, Carrera was asked for commentary by The Spectrum, a St. George-area newspaper, on the local case of Susan Russell, who was charged with 15 counts of third-degree felony distribution of pornographic material. Russell allegedly sold pornographic materials and sex toys from a back room in her Earrings and More store, potentially violating the “community standards” of the Mormon-dominated town per the Miller v. California Supreme Court case.
Carrera opined: “I deliberately moved to St. George with my husband so we could raise our kids in a conservative atmosphere, in a low-crime, family friendly state. I do appreciate that the laws are there, and will make it harder for my kids to get into trouble when they get older.”
However, she also explained, “Do I have a problem with porn being sold here? No, not per se. I have no problem with porn at all. Trust me, they don’t exploit women, and watching porn has never been scientifically shown to lead to any increase in crime rates, be it rape, pedophilia, or any other sexual crimes.”
Nevertheless, she reiterated that the community’s conservatism was the reason she moved there, and that she had no plans to challenge it nor, by implication, the arrest of people distributing movies in which she may herself have starred.

Neither Vin nor Diesel is his real name (it's Mark Vincent), but it was a given that creatures like this do not have names so much as titles. He's lately known more for the movie The Pacifier (original working name, Oh My God, what am I watching? Oh, right, poop.), and not known, thankfully, for his "comedic" turn in Find Me Guilty. But, one can hardly mention Vin Diesel's name without remembering severed carotid's and snapped necks.
Multifacial, a movie he produced for $3,000 (and which, surprisingly, is not porn) gained the attention of Steven Spielberg, who cast him in Saving Private Ryan. This started off Vin Diesel's film career in a long string of roles being surly, growling one-liners, looking intimidating without even trying, and racking up a body count (huge) and number of Oscars (zero) to rival Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime.
And, the whole time, he was playing Dungeons and Dragons. Has been for over 20 years. Seriously, somewhere on his body is a tattoo of his player character's name. Now, that's hardcore gamester.
His geek flag flew higher when he opened up his own gaming development house, Tigon Studios, just because he was tired of people making crappy games based on movies. The very fabric of existence was rent asunder when, to the shocked and frightened gasps of a reviewing public, it turned out The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay, the first video game based on a movie since Goldeneye was not just better than the movie, but better than just about every other game that came out that year. It's average review score was 90 percent, according to MetaCritic.
Retired porn star Asia Carrera, real name Jessica Steinhauser, is a bit of a legend in the porn industry. With 36-26-36 measurements, she performed in a jaw-dropping 400 hundred films in her career and exchanged an unthinkable amount of bodily fluids. She's also mother of two.
She calls herself "the nerd of porn," and we assumed it was some kind of in-joke, until we saw her credentials. Here is somebody who studied piano as a child and by the age of 14 was playing in Carnegie Hall.
At 16, she went to Japan and taught English classes. She was a state spelling champ, in the National Mathematics League, a Spanish National Honor Society member, placing in National Geography, Language and Math Olympiads, and is a member of Mensa. That got her a free ride to Rutgers, where she double-majored in business and Japanese. This naturally inspired her to change her first name to Asia and become an entrepreneur in America's fastest growing business.
Either that, or her self-professed hatred of her parents' pressure on her to succeed academically made her lash out by riding random guys reverse cowgirl on camera. Whatever works.
When she and her brother get in the room together, she admits a tendency to "geek out," and would rather volley IMs back and forth than hold an actual conversation. The sex lives of some of our staff members are, to be honest, quite similar, so we can relate. Her geek hallmark, however, is her love of LAN parties and Unreal Tournament (handle: megab*tchgoddess).
Now that she's no longer taking shots to the face while sprawled out on pool tables, you can expect her to dish it just as hard and fast online. Keep an eye out for her self-made skins, or download them yourself:
In case your musical knowledge doesn't pre-date the '90s, Brian May played lead guitar, wrote for and was the sometimes lead singer of Queen. He put the words "We Will Rock You" (surprisingly), "Who Wants to Live Forever" (ironically), and "Fat-Bottomed Girls" (not so surprisingly) in Freddie Mercury's mouth. Sometimes Freddie shrugged and said, "Ah, bloody 'ell, I broke my last bottle of Goldschlager with 'at 'igh C, so's 'ow about I shut my gob and let you 'ave a go at it?" and sang back up to him.
In the early '70s, he also had a Bachelor of Sciences degree with honors from the Imperial College of London and was in the middle of his doctorate studying how light reflects off of dust floating in space and the movement of that dust within the solar system. While we at Cracked are sure that Brian May's heart was pounding with excitement when he first signed up for the classes, we admit that you probably had to be there to give a rat's ass.
May also apparently grew tired of it, because at that point he took 30 years off from his doctorate to become a millionaire, one of the best guitar players in the world and a member of one of the greatest rock bands in history.
When he wasn't busy rocking faces, May fiddled around with astrophysics, co-authoring two scientific papers and the book Bang! - The Complete History of the Universe with Christ Lintott and Patrick Moore. He also has been a regular guest on the latter's show The Sky at Night for years). Finally, after he was satisfied that he had squeezed all the rocking he could into one lifetime, he went back and got his doctorate in the fall of '07.
Then, he was appointed Chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University, meaning we now have a man who can look upon both Albert Einstein and Eddie Van Halen and ask why they didn't get more done.
Mr. Lundgren was an almost-superstar back in the '80s, having played comic hero The Punisher (1989 version) and even He-Man (1987). But, his greatest acting accomplishments is beating Apollo Creed into something resembling grape jelly and inspiring the greatest Rocky montage of all time.
As it turns out, this towering blond monster who casually told Sylvester Stallone, "I will break you," could have, in fact, probably calculated the amount of effort (in force pounds per square inch and Joules expenditure) needed to do just that in his head.
The man reportedly has an IQ of 160. He graduated from the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, got his master's in chemical engineering, then was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to MIT. After just two weeks of that, his superhuman intellect allowed him to calculate that a life spent inventing life-saving chemicals would mathematically contain less awesome than one movie spent playing He-Man.
Hey, did we mention that he speaks five languages (French, Swedish, German, English and Italian)? Or, that he's a Pentathlon Team Leader and a former Ranger? And a third-degree black belt?
So, really, to play a superhuman machine of destruction in Rocky IV, he still had to tone it down quite a bit. Hell, this man had to tone it down to play He-Man.

NJ spelling champ, National Mathematics League, Spanish National Honor Society, placed in National Geography, Language Arts, and Mathematics Olympiads.
(Ernesto Lecuona's 'Malaguena' and Bach's 13th Invention), taught Colloquial English at Tsuruga College in Japan at 16
Attended performing arts high school (emphasis on instrumental music and visual arts), National Merit Scholarship Winner (for 1440 on SAT's), and Garden State Scholar (for nerdly grades). Attended Rutgers University on full academic scholarship, with a double-major in Business and Japanese.  Did not graduate.
Lots.  I was a homely kid, I tell you!  2 nose jobs, (the first guy was a quack!) liposuction on my lower abdomen, & inner thighs, and my boob job.  I've had my boobs redone twice since the initial surgery because of scar tissue buildup, and I expect that will be a recurring event in years to come.  Although I don't regret my boobjob at all, I would strongly caution girls outside the pornstar/stripper industry to think twice before going under the knife.  If you don't get naked for a living, all that pain and expense can be avoided by hiding a little extra padding inside your push-up bra instead!!!
Being a widowed mom of two small kids a year apart is pretty much all I have time for these days!  But I also enjoy reading non-fiction books on history, biographies, survival stories, and true crime.  And I work out, a lot.  I actually read WHILE working out, LOL!
I got married to nutritionist/fitness guru/writer/hunky studmuffin Don Lemmon on 12/19/03.  We had a baby girl named Catalina, born 03/04/05, and then Don died in a car accident on June 10, 2006 while I was pregnant with our son, Devin.  Devin was born on July 31st.  I delivered him at home, all by myself.  
Before Don, I was married to XXX director Bud Lee for 8 years, from 9/95 to 9/03.  Bud and I are still very close, and he'll always be my "daddy" who looks out for me.
Warren Buffett!  *sigh*...  Warren is the legendary financial genius behind the most expensive stock in the world, Berkshire Hathaway.  He was the richest man in America before Bill Whats-his-name and the Silicon Valley geeks took over, yet he's always remained a modest and down-to-earth kinda guy.  For years, I invested only in mutual funds, but finally I gathered the courage to buy some baby Berkshire shares right before the tech collapse.  Go Warren!
=======================================================
I got awfully tired of telling this over and over, so I'm telling it for the last time - here it is:)
OK, we all know I was an academically gifted little girl. What I don't publicize, is that I was not an especially motivated one. I was an overachiever only through a)genetic luck, and b)incredible pressure from my parents. My parents wanted me to go to Harvard and be a doctor or a lawyer, and I wanted to play piano and hang out with friends.
Needless to say, my parents and I butted heads. My father was born in Japan, and my mother was born in Germany.  They were from the "old school", strong on discipline, and overachievers themselves, so they were in no way being hypocritical with their demands on me. (My dad went to Caltech on full academic scholarship for math and physics. He's the biggest nerd I know)
I was grounded for every "B" I got, and beaten for getting anything lower than that. I was not allowed to socialize at all, or go to parties, because they said there'd be time for that after I got into a good college. Well, I did what any red-blooded American kid would do, I'd sneak out. And get caught. And get beaten. And get grounded again. Without launching into too much detail, let's just say I was unhappy. (I tried to kill myself a lot) (Asian kids everywhere have e-mailed me to verify that this is standard practice in Asian households - what a relief to find out I'm normal, huh!)
Shortly before my seventeenth birthday, I ran away from home. I stayed where I could, with a rock'n'roll band, with friends, with strangers, in hotels, at one point in a tent. I worked when I could, but I couldn't do much at seventeen, so I had no money. I had friends drive me to school every day, and I begged people to bring me Doritos so I'd have something to eat. Everything I owned fit in two garbage bags. Sometimes I fucked people I didn't want to, so I could have a place to sleep, or a good meal. I gritted my teeth a lot, and did what I had to, rather than crawl back home and grovel for my folks' forgiveness.
Eventually the State found out I was living on my own, and I got put in a foster home. My foster parents were as strict as my own parents, and I still was not allowed to date or socialize.  This was twice as difficult
for me to handle, after having had a taste of freedom, but I stayed until I finished high school.  I ran away from my foster home on my eighteenth birthday, knowing I only had to fend for myself until the fall, when I was going to Rutgers on my full academic scholarship.  I hitchhiked off with my two garbage bags of stuff, and did what I could to not starve until school started.
So I confess, I went to college not for an education, but for the promise of a hot meal and a free bed while I plotted ways to become wealthy, so I wouldn't have to go begging or fucking any more strangers for lousy scraps of charity.  Four years of college is a goal I'd like to finish attaining one day, but for a runaway who lost 15 pounds without enough food to eat, getting money in the bank immediately was my priority.  I got a job as a bartender, and wished I had the guts to become a stripper 'cause I heard they made lots of money. One day the owner of the bar asked me if I would serve drinks topless at a private party for $100. Wow, a hundred bucks was a lot of dough for me, so I said sure. I drank a lot of vodka to screw up my courage. Next thing you knew, I was on the bar with some strippers he'd hired, and I was collecting tips like crazy. I came home with $300 bucks, and was amazed. I'd never made that much money in my life!
The next day I took a bottle of vodka and got myself hired at all the local go-go bars. I then proceeded to work seven nights a week, and I saved a minimum of $1000 every week, and sent it off to various mutual funds. (ever hear of someone who still has the first dollar they ever made? That would be me!)  I obviously stopped attending classes, only going in to take finals.  As one of the highest paid dancers in NJ, I searched for a way to get paid even more money dancing.  I discovered that girls who made movies or magazines got paid more than regular 'house girls' like me.
I went to the local 7-11, bought all the men's magazines, and sent pictures of myself to the little addresses inside the first couple pages.  Club magazine responded, and sent me to a photographer in NY, who proceeded to shoot me for most of the major men's mags.  I asked him about making adult movies, and he gave me the number of a director in LA named Bud Lee.  I called this Bud guy, and he told me if I flew to LA, he could use me in a movie or two.  So during winter break '93, I flew out to LA with just a suitcase and a teddy bear.  I found that I liked making movies, then I married that Bud Lee guy, and the rest, as they say, is history.
I know some of you still think I'm "settling for less than I could achieve" in life, but all I can say is this: I'm happier than I've ever been in my life, and I don't consider that "settling" at all!  I have a fun job that provides me with the time and money to do all the things I love, like playing piano, drawing, writing, and working on my web site!  I've slowly lost the hard edge and the "fuck-the-world" attitude I had
as a runaway, and gained a love for life that I never had before.  I save and invest for the future, and I'm going to finish my degree at my leisure.  After I'm done with adult, I'll be a mom, or a stock analyst, or knowing me, probably both.  And when I die, I'm leaving behind a trust fund to provide help and shelter for abused and homeless children, so a little piece of me will live forever! 
 p.s. I'm not mad at my parents.  I know they just wanted me to be the best I could be, but they pushed too hard, that's all.  Being successful is great, and it's a goal I strive for, but never at the expense of happiness.  I think happiness should come first, and then success!
