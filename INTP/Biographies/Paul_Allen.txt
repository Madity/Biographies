Paul Gardner Allen (born January 21, 1953) is an American business magnate, investor and philanthropist, best known as the co-founder, with Bill Gates, of Microsoft Corporation. As of March 2013, he was estimated to be the 53rd-richest person in the world, with an estimated wealth of $15 billion.[1]
He is the founder and chairman of Vulcan Inc., which manages his various business and philanthropic efforts. Allen also has a multi-billion dollar investment portfolio including technology companies, real estate holdings, and stakes in other technology, media, and content companies. Allen also owns two professional sports teams, the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL),[2] and the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).[3] He is also part-owner of the Seattle Sounders FC, which joined Major League Soccer (MLS) in 2009.[4]
He is also the founder of the Allen Institute for Brain Science,[5] the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence,[6] and Stratolaunch Systems.[7]
Paul Allen was born in Seattle, Washington, to parents Kenneth Samuel Allen, an associate director of the University of Washington libraries, and Edna Faye (née Gardner) Allen, on January 21, 1953.[8] Allen attended Lakeside School, a private school in Seattle, and befriended Bill Gates, who was almost three years younger and shared a common enthusiasm for computers.[9] They used Lakeside's Teletype terminal to develop their programming skills on several time-sharing computer systems.[9] After earning a perfect score of 1600 on the SAT (pre-1995 scale), Allen went to Washington State University, where he joined Phi Kappa Theta fraternity,[10] but dropped out after two years in order to work as a programmer for Honeywell in Boston, placing him near his old friend again.[9] Allen later convinced Gates to drop out of Harvard University in order to create Microsoft.
Allen co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1975, and began marketing a BASIC programming language interpreter.[9] Allen came up with the original name of "Micro-Soft," as recounted in a 1995 Fortune magazine article.[11] In 1980, after promising to deliver IBM a Disk Operating System (DOS) they had not yet developed for the Intel 8088-based IBM PC, Allen spearheaded a deal for Microsoft to purchase a Quick and Dirty Operating System (QDOS) written by Tim Paterson who, at the time, was employed at Seattle Computer Products. As a result of this transaction, Microsoft was able to secure a contract to supply the DOS that would eventually run on IBM's PC line. This contract with IBM was the watershed in Microsoft history that led to Allen and Gates' wealth.[9]
Allen was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1982. His cancer was successfully treated by several months of radiation therapy. However, he did not return to Microsoft and began distancing himself from the company.[9] Allen officially resigned from his position on the Microsoft Board of Directors in November 2000 but was asked to consult as a senior strategy advisor to the company's executives[12] and still owns a reported 138 million shares.[13]

(L to R) Marion Blakely, FAA - Chief. Commercial Astronaut- "Mike" Melvill - Sir Richard Branson - "Burt" Rutan - Brian Binnie & Paul Gardner Allen reflect on a mission accomplished (October 4, 2004)
Paul Allen (third from right) and Burt Rutan (fifth from right) were presented with the Ansari X PRIZE by members of the X PRIZE Foundation in 2004.
Allen confirmed that he was the sole investor behind Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites' SpaceShipOne suborbital commercial spacecraft on October 4, 2004.[61] SpaceShipOne climbed to an altitude of 377,591 feet (115,090 m) and was the first privately funded effort to successfully put a civilian in suborbital space. It won the Ansari X Prize competition and received the $10 million prize.[62]
On December 13, 2011, Allen announced the creation of Stratolaunch Systems. Stratolaunch is a proposed orbital launch system consisting of a dual-bodied, 6 engine jet aircraft, capable of carrying a rocket to high altitude; the rocket would then separate from its carrier aircraft and fire its own engines to complete its climb into orbit. If successful, this project would be the first wholly privately funded space transport system.[63] Stratolanch, which is partnering with Orbital Sciences Corporation and Scaled Composites, is intended to launch in inclement weather, fly without worrying about the availability of launch pads and to operate from different locations. Stratolaunch plans to ultimately host six to ten missions per year.[64]
Allen's Vulcan Real Estate is a key developer and investor in the development of the South Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle as a biotechnology hub and mixed-use community.[65] Allen is also the largest private landowner in South Lake Union and owns nearly 2,600,000 square feet (240,000 m2) in the neighborhood.[65] His holdings company has a development capacity of more than 10,000,000 square feet (930,000 m2) of new residential, office, retail and biotech research space.[65] The South Lake Union redevelopment represents one of the largest urban revitalization projects in the country.[66] Allen has made investments estimated at US$200 million as of 2005, and promoted for city funding of the Seattle Streetcar line known as South Lake Union Streetcar, which runs from Seattle's Westlake Center to the south end of Lake Union.[67] The Streetcar is a public and private partnership made possible because of a Local Improvement District (LID) supported by businesses and residents along the line;[68] it officially started operation on December 12, 2007.[69] This development has been criticized as a city-supported real estate investment for Vulcan Inc.,[70] and concerns over the loss of low-income housing have been expressed.[71]
In 2012, The Wall Street Journal called Allen's South Lake Union investment "unexpectedly lucrative" and one that led to his firm selling a 1,800,000 square feet (170,000 m2) office complex to Amazon.com for US$1.16 billion, one of the most expensive office deals ever in Seattle. "It's exceeded my expectations," Mr. Allen said of the South Lake Union development.[72]
Sports & Event Centers: Allen invested more than $150 million in Portland’s Moda Center, which he now owns outright. He also contributed more than $140 million to help build CenturyLink Field in Seattle.
Seattle Cinerama: Allen purchased Seattle’s historic Cinerama Theater in 1998, and upgraded it with 3-D capability and digital sound, in addition to interior and exterior refurbishing. The theater is set to install the world’s first commercial digital laser projector in early 2014.
Hospital Club: Allen opened the Hospital Club in London in 2002 as a professional and social hub for people working in the creative arts.
The launch of Paul Allen's 414 feet (126 m) yacht, Octopus, secured its position as one of the world's largest yachts in 2003.[73] As of 2013, it is 14th in the list of motor yachts by length. The yacht is equipped with two helicopters, two submarines, a swimming pool, a music studio and a basketball court.[74]
Allen has loaned Octopus, which is equipped with a submarine and ROV, for a variety of rescue and research operations,[75] notably assisting in a hunt for an American pilot and two officers whose plane disappeared off of Palau and loaning his yacht to scientists to study a rare fish called a coelacanth.[76] In 2012, he loaned the ship to the Royal Navy in their attempt to retrieve the bell from the HMS Hood, which sank in the Denmark Strait during WWII, as a national memorial.[77]Octopus is a member of AMVER, a voluntary group ship reporting system used worldwide by authorities to arrange assistance for those in distress at sea.[78]
Allen is known for throwing huge, celebrity-studded parties on his yacht, such as a 2005 New Year's Eve party in which he and his band played Johnny Cash songs with R&B star Usher. His band also played at another party he hosted during the Cannes film festival with keyboardist Dave Stewart.[79][80][81]
Allen purchased the Portland Trail Blazers NBA team in 1988 from California real estate developer Larry Weinberg for $70 million.[3] He was also instrumental in the development and funding of the Rose Garden in 1993.[9] The Blazers were valued at $457 million in January 2013 according to Forbes, ranked No. 15 out of 30 NBA teams.[82] Allen announced the completion of the acquisition of the Rose Garden on April 2, 2007, and stated that this was a major milestone and a positive step for the franchise.[83] In 2013, the Rose Garden was renamed the Moda Center, a move Allen said "will allow us to enhance virtually every aspect of the fan experience."[84]
Allen purchased the Seattle Seahawks NFL team in 1997 when former owner Ken Behring threatened to move the Seahawks to Southern California.[2] "I'm not sure anybody else in this community would have done what [Allen] did," Herman Sarkowsky, a former Seahawks minority owner, told The Seattle Times about Allen's decision to buy the team. "That was the birth of the stadium, and the birth of the stadium was the lifeline for the club we know today."[85] The Seahawks were valued at $1.08 billion in August 2013 by Forbes, which says the team has "one of the most rabid fan bases in the NFL."[86] Under the helm of Allen the Seattle Seahawks won their first Super Bowl in 2014.[87]
Allen's Vulcan Sports & Entertainment is part of the ownership team of the Seattle Sounders FC, a Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise that began play in 2009 at CenturyLink Field, a stadium also controlled by Allen.[4] The ownership team also includes film producer Joe Roth, businessman Adrian Hanauer, and comedian Drew Carey. Sigi Schmid, two-time MLS Cup winner, is the team’s head coach.
The Sounders sold out every home game during its first season, setting a new MLS record for average match attendance and the most season tickets sold in the league. Seattle Sounders FC is only the second expansion team in MLS history to win the U.S. Open Cup tournament in its first season.
Paul and Jody Allen are the owners and executive producers of Vulcan Productions,[88] a media company headquartered in Seattle. Their films have received various recognition, ranging from a Peabody[89] to Independent Spirit Awards,[90] Grammys[91] and Emmys.[91] The films have also been nominated for Golden Globes[91] and Academy Awards[90] among many others.

CEO of Vulcan Inc.###Co-founder of Microsoft Corp.###Owner, Seattle SeaHawks(NFL)###Owner, Portland Trail Blazers(NBA)###Mojave Aerospace Ventures
A relentless investor, Paul Allen is best known as the co-founder of Microsoft with Bill Gates. Though Paul Allen currently does not share a good rapport with Bill Gates, but it was Paul, who had convinced Bill Gates to drop out of Harvard. Paul and Bill Gates were schoolmates, though Paul was 2 years senior to Bill. After completing school, Allen went on to attend Washington State University, which he promptly dropped out of in order to work as a programmer for Honeywell in Boston. Here he regained contact with his old pal Bill and convinced him to drop out of Harvard in order to create Microsoft. He has recently authored a book, Idea Man: A memoir by the co-founder of Microsoft, which talks in detail about his troubled relationship with his long time friend Bill.
He has a multi-billion dollar investment portfolio with stakes in all sorts of companies, which includes domains like technology, real estate and media among others. But, Microsoft forms the major part of his $13 billion fortune. Besides his passion for work, Paul is equally known for his ostentatious lifestyle unlike the frugal lifestyle of Bill Gates. Paul is known for his love for megayachts and he also owns two sports team, one from NFL and the other from NBA and has stakes in Seattle Sounders FC. His notable other lifestyle expenses include Vulcan Productions, a film production company, SpaceShipOne, a suborbital commercial spacecraft and lots of real estates in South Lake Union.
"I am very excited to be supporting one of the world's most visionary efforts to seek basic answers to some of the fundamental question about our universe and what other civilisations may exist elsewhere."
"In my own work, I've tried to anticipate what's coming over the horizon, to hasten its arrival, and to apply it to people's lives in a meaningful way."
"“What should exist? To me, that's the most exciting question imaginable. What do we need that we don't have? How can we realize our potential?”"
"When it comes to helping out, I don't believe in doing it for the media attention. My goal is to support the organizations that need help."
"“In my own work, I've tried to anticipate what's coming over the horizon, to hasten its arrival, and to apply it to people's lives in a meaningful way.”"
"“For the most part, the best opportunities now lie where your competitors have yet to establish themselves, not where they're already entrenched. Microsoft is struggling to adapt to that new reality.”"
"“Here's what the death knell for the personal computer will sound like: Mainly I use my phone/paid, but I still use my PC to write long e-mails and documents. Most people aren't there yet, but that's where we're headed”"
"“In a company where tech decisions were still ultracentralized, the repercussions of a distracted CEO had to be damaging.”"
"From the time we'd started together in Massachusetts, I'd assumed that our partnership would be a 50-50 proposition. But Bill had another idea. 'It's not right for you to get half,' he said. 'I should get more. I think it should be 60-40.'"
Paul Allen has a love for quirky topics which includes outer space and beyond. He has spent millions to the SETI Institute to fund research to scan outer space for signs of intelligent life. Also he was the sole investor behind the Spaceshipone spacecraft, which successfully put a civilian in the suborbital space.

Paul Allen who owns investments in more than 40 high-tech and multi-media companies and properties across the globe also owns a condo in the luxurious location of Beverly Hills.
Accommodation: Paul Allen's bulging property portfolio includes another 12,952 square foot Mediterranean style mansion in Beverly Hills, CA. The mansion has a massive underground garage, along with very obvious luxuries like pool and tennis court. The mansion was built in the early 1990s and was sold by writer/producer/director John Landis who is perhaps best known for writing and directing Michael Jackson's Thriller video.
Neighborhood: Beverly Hill is one of the most talked about location when it comes to celebrity homes. Many stars such as Pamela Anderson, Elvis Presley, David Beckham and others owns luxurious properties in the same area. 
Location: Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen owns a beautiful ranch in the western side of the Grand Tetons, U.S
Accommodation: The ranch is constructed using high quality wood and designed in classic western style, the main lodge features five-bedroom and offers stunning views. Paul is among the growing list of billionaires who are renting out their not so used properties to earn some extra money, which they have in abundance anyways. The rates vary around $2,900 per night in high season.
In what has been speculated as a mirror of the mid-90s Microsoft expansion, it's co-founder Paul Allen who seems to be on a real-estate buying rage! The latest property on his purchase list has been from Wade Thompson's widow, Angela Thompson. The property was unlisted but information from A. Laurence Kaiser, proprietor for Key Ventures, shows that though the home is smaller than other units in the building, it cost Mr.Allen a good $25 million. The building was built in 1907 and became a co-op in 1949.
Location: The penthouse is located at 4 East, 66th Street on the Upper east side of Manhattan in New York, USA.
Accommodation: The absence of listing information makes it difficult to state precisely the accommodation available in the home. However, this much is speculated by Mr.Kaiser that the home probably has 7 bedrooms and at least 5 -6 bathrooms.
Features: The building as such is very impressive and handsome with a large cornice. The awesome entrance portals are flanked by columns which have been topped with pediments on the side street. Images from Google Maps show that the penthouse has a spacious and large terrace with an impressive roofline.
This penthouse has been shaped as a barbell and is full of over-sized windows. The wrap-around terrace surrounding the home offers panoramic views of the city and Central Park.
Neighborhood: The building has been home to many big-time celebrities and thus has been in the news on several occasions. Socialite Veronica Hearst had owned the 6th floor residence before it went into foreclosure. Pharma bigwig Howard Solomon, director of Duetsche Bank Kevin Parker, hedge fund hero Daniel Nir and ex-CEO of Bear Stearns, Ace Greenberg are the residents here.
Paul Allen owns this 416 foot yacht, which held the title of the biggest yacht in the world when it was delivered. Currently, the Octopus stands as the 12th largest yacht in the world. The exterior of the yacht were designed by Espen Naval Architects and it was built by well known German shipbuilders Lürssen in Bremen and HDW in Kiel. Paul Allen likes to hold annual Cannes Film Festival parties on his yacht, which invites celebrities from all over the world. His guest itinerary includes Bar Refaeli, Jane Fonda, Jodie Foster, Paul Haggis and Ryan Gosling.
Custom built to suit the preferences o fits owner, the yacht’s interior has been designed by Jonathan Quinn Barnett. The main attraction of the yacht other than its plush VIP suits, pool, Jacuzzi and a state of the art recording studio is the plethora of toys, which come along with it. It has two helicopters, seven boats and a 10 man submarine which can hold eight persons for upto two weeks underwater. Plus, the package also includes a remote controlled vehicle for crawling on the ocean floor.
Octopus offers accommodation for up to 26 guests in 41 suites. She is also capable of carrying up to 57 members of crew onboard to ensure a relaxed cruising experience. 
Octopus has a cruising speed of 17 knots, max speed of 20 knots and a range of 8000 nm from her 850000-litre fuel tanks. 
Tatoosh is another mega yacht owned by Allen. It is 303- feet in length and has five decks. Named after an island in the San Juans, she is known for its lavish spread of luxury which can put even the most extravagant facility to shame. It was handed to Allen by fellow billionaire Craig McCaw, who also passed on with it the America's Cup legacy. On this HDW-Nobiskrg 301-footer, Allen and his family have the entire top deck to themselves. The owner's suite includes a full-width bedroom, two other staterooms, a communal family room, an office, gymnasium and an observation lounge above. Six guest staterooms, panoramic lounge and dining saloons and a cinema are positioned on the lower decks. Paul Allen currently has up it for sale with a price tag of about $163,000,000.
Paris Hilton probably described it right a while ago who tweeted that she was “on heaven on the water” after spending time abroad this jewel 
At 199 feet, this is the smallest yacht owned by Paul Allen. The Meduse was built in the country of Netherlands and designed using traditional interpretations of Mcmillen from New York . This compact superyacht has the capacity to sleep overnight a maximum of 12 passengers and 15 members of crew. Fast transportation is not a problem as she comes with a helicopter pad. Back in 2001 Meduse was the biggest yacht owned by Paul Allen. He used it many times to jam up with his band in the onboard recording studio. Mister Allen wanted to sell the boat for $52,500,000 however, it’s not clear if the yacht has been sold or is still in his possession.
Mig-29 is a great addition to Paul Allen’s most amazing collections of toys for boys. He purchased it from the Vulcan Warbirds Company. It is a two-Seater Soviet-designed fighter that proudly served with Russia and the Ukrainian Air Force before coming to the U.S. for restoration.
The latest plaything in the billionaire's playground is a fully operational 40-foot yellow submarine for which he has paid a huge sum of $12 million. Allen's craze for these gorgeous water beasts might be the reason that his net worth is only a third to that of Bill Gates. 
Paul Allen is a music fanatic. Not onlly he maintains a complete band, but also has a dedicated recording studio in each of his yachts and homes. He jams up with his band regularly and treats others to rocking sessions of music on his yacht. The Experience Music Project is a brainchile Mr. Allen and is a haven for any music afficionadao, where he has displayed a collection of antique guitars and other rare music collectibles. 
His interest in space and extra terrestrial conquests has led him to invest million of dollars in the SpaceshipOne project, which was the first succesful suborbital spacecraft. Designed by the illustrious designer, Burt Rutan,  SpaceShipOne climbed to an altitude of 115,090 m and was the first privately funded effort to successfully put a civilian in suborbital space. 
He also provided the search for extra-terrestrial life a big boost when he invested $11.5 milllion to construct an array of ultra powerful telescopes, aptly named "The Allen Telescope Array", which is installed in SETI complex. 
Paul Allen is one of the most avid art collector in the world. His art colllection is reportedly worth more than $250 million and includes works of Picasso, Montelo and other famous artists. Much was not known about his collection until he had a change of heart and decided to give public a glimpse of what all he had accumulated at his home using his humongous amount of wealth. 
He also has a assortment of flying planes dating back to the world war era, which he has put up for public display under the name of The Flying Heritage. 
Allen owns the amazing Porsche 959, which is recognized as the most technologically advanced road-going sports car ever built. It can reach 0-100 mph in 8.6 sec. It has a top speed of 190 mph.
Paul Allen owns a Mazda B series pickup truck which has 2.2L 85 hp I4 engine, and a horsepower of 85. It also features the 4 speed automatic overdrive.

Paul Allen made a tremendous contribution of $26 million to his alma mater, Washington State University, for its School for Global Animal Health. His main objective was the establishment of the Faye G. Allen Center for Visual Arts, named after his mother. He along with his sister named Jo Lynn Allen pledged $100 million in 2003 to find the Allen Institute for Brain Science, which is a nonprofit corporation and a medical research organization. There are numerous scientific findings of Paul Allen that have proved invaluable to international researchers working on cures for neurological and nervous .system illnesses and injuries.
He is the man behind the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation. It is a private foundation that is located in Seattle, Washington. They work with the main objective of transforming individual lives and strengthening communities by fostering innovation, creating knowledge, and promoting social progress.
Paul Allen's love for art is truly depicted in his collection of paintings. The Kiss is a 1962 creation, a significant comic strip painting, for which Roy Lichtenstein earned instant fame.

Allen’s passion for aviation and history made him to acquire, preserve, and even share them with the public these iconic warriors and workhorses, many of which are the last of their kind.
It was not untill Paul Allen displayed a part of his $250  million art collection that many knew he was the anonymous buyer of this painting, sold at an auction of Sotheby's. He got it for a whopping $39.2 million, which is a record for any French artist. A creation of Paul Gauguin, the painting depicts  The 1899 Gauguin work depicts three topless Polynesian women, one of them breast- feeding a baby.
It was coupled alongside Kenji Yanobe's Atom Suit Project:Desert at the art display. This obscure pairing is the brain-child of renowned Impressionist expert and art historian Paul Hayes Tucker, who was the curator at the exhibition.

=======================================================
Paul G. Allen (born 1953) co - founded one of the world's most lucrative and influential companies, the Microsoft Corporation, in 1974. The company's products revolutionized personal computing and made founders Allen and Bill Gates billionaires. Allen left the company in 1983 due to illness, and has since invested in a wide variety of projects in the technology, entertainment, sports, and aerospace fields. In addition, he has contributed substantial amounts of money to various charities and research organizations.Allen was born on January 21, 1953, in Seattle, Washington, and grew up in the nearby suburb of Wedgewood. His parents, Faye and Kenneth Allen, were both librarians at the University of Washington, and they introduced Allen and his sister Jody to a wide variety of cultural offerings, regularly taking their children to museums, galleries, and concerts. Allen's parents also encouraged his early love of reading and science, and his mother hosted meetings for his grade school science club. Allen melded these two interests in his avid enthusiasm for science fiction novels, including the Tom Swift series. "Tom Swift was very futuristic - he went to outer space, and there were rockets and submarines and all kinds of machines," Faye Allen told People magazine. "He was a role model for Paul."In 1965, Allen began seventh grade at Lakeside School, a prestigious private school in Seattle. Three years later he met eighth - grader Bill Gates who, like Allen, spent most of his free time figuring out the inner workings of their school's new computer. "Our friendship started after the mothers' club paid to put a computer terminal in the school in 1968," Gates told Fortune in 1995. "The notion was that, of course, the teachers would figure out this computer thing and then teach it to the students. But that didn't happen. It was the other way around." The pair became so adept with computer technology that, while still in school, they were both invited to serve as amateur technicians at a local computer center in exchange for free computer time. "At the end of every school day, a bunch of us would take our little leather satchel briefcases and ride the bus downtown to the computer center," Allen recalled in Fortune. "Bill and I were the guys that stayed the latest, and afterward we'd go eat pizza at this hippie place across the street." Despite Allen and Gates' efforts, the center eventually went bankrupt and the pair cites the ensuing repossession activities as their early introduction to the realities of the business world.Co - founded MicrosoftAllen graduated from high school in 1971 and entered Washington State University. That same year, he read about the Intel Corporation's 4004 chip, the first computer microprocessor. In 1972, he and Gates purchased the next generation of the chip, the 8008, for $360. The pair used the chip to develop a special computer that conducted traffic - volume - count analysis and started a company called Traf - O - Data, planning to sell the computers to traffic departments. Allen and Gates eventually abandoned the company, but applied the technology to their next venture. In 1973, they both took jobs at a company called TRW in Vancouver, Washington, where they used minicomputers to distribute power from hydroelectric dams.In 1974, Gates left Washington to attend Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Allen followed, dropping out of Washington State and accepting a job as a computer programmer at the Honeywell Corporation in Boston. Allen hit upon the seed for their next business move in a Popular Electronics magazine cover story describing the MITS Altair 8800 minicomputer. Recognizing that the computer would need a programming language, Allen and Gates set out to write a version of BASIC, a widely used computer language, specifically geared toward the Altair. Under the auspices of their new corporation, Micro - Soft, they convinced MITS to sell their programming language. According to the Fortune interview, the credit line in the source code of their first product read: "Micro - Soft BASIC; Bill Gates wrote a lot of stuff; Paul Allen wrote some other stuff."Allen and Gates soon changed the company's spelling to Microsoft and moved their business to MITS' headquarters in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The young entrepreneurs launched quickly into the technology side of their new business; their management technique developed more slowly. They did not even incorporate their company until 1981. "Our management style was a little loose in the beginning," Allen recalled in Fortune, "We both took part in every decision, and it's hard to remember who did what. If there was a difference between our roles, I was probably the one always pushing a little bit in terms of new technology and new products, and Bill was more interested in doing negotiations and contracts and business deals." Gates remembered the work atmosphere as congenial. "We didn't have many major disagreements, but there was one tiny source of tension: I would always be calling Paul in the morning to tell him it was time to come work on this stuff," he said in the same interview. "He slept even later than me."Returned to SeattleAllen and Gates soon built up an impressive client list that included Ricoh, Texas Instruments, Radio Shack and another new startup, Apple Computers. MITS' business began to dwindle as Apple and other emerged as competitors, leaving Allen and Gates with no reason to remain in Albuquerque. In 1978, with sales already over $1 million, they relocated their company to Bellevue, a suburb of Seattle. There, they experienced significant growth, and by 1979 had hired more than 35 employees and a professional manager.The company entered into one of the most significant business deals in its 25 - year history in 1980. That year, InternationalBusinessMachines(IBM)approachedMicrosoft seeking a programming language for its new personal computer, secretly under development. That same year, Allen negotiated the purchase of Q - DOS, a little - used operating system produced by Seattle Computer. Since Seattle Computer was unaware of Microsoft's pending IBM deal, Allen was able to secure a low price for Q - DOS. "We were afraid they were going to find out the reason we wanted to buy it was because IBM was our primary customer," Allen told Fortune. "If they found that out, the price for Q - DOS would go way up." Microsoft paid $50,000 for Q - DOS and, in turn, licensed the product to IBM for use with its new PC.In addition, Gates and Allen convinced IBM to allow other companies to copy the specifications of their PC, spurring the ensuing flood of PC "clones." The widespread availability of PCs necessitated compatible software programs which, in turn, required a universal operating system. In addition to Microsoft Disk Operating System, or MS - DOS, programmers had the option of using a competing system developed by Digital Research in Monterey, California. Gates and Allen urged software developers in both the U.S. and Europe to write to their specifications, however, and met with much success. As the PC, supported by MS - DOS, became the most widely used computer in the world, Microsoft became the domineering force in the computer programming industry.Retired from CompanyIn 1982, Allen was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, a form of cancer. He continued to work part - time at Microsoft during 22 months of radiation treatments, but in March 1983 he retired from the company and spent the next two years traveling, scuba diving, yachting, skiing and spending time with his family. He retained a 13 percent share of the company and continued to serve on its board. "To be 30 years old and have that kind of shock - to face your mortality - really makes you feel like you should do some of the things that you haven't done," Allen told Fortune.Although finances were not a concern - as of 2003, he was estimated to be the world's fourth wealthiest citizen worth $21 billion - Allen sought out new business and investment opportunities. Pursuing a notion of a "wired world" in which computers and related technology serve as the primary source of communication and information - gathering, Allen founded Asymetrix, which produced applications that allowed both programmers and non - programmers to develop their own software, and then Vulcan Ventures, an investment firm focused on technology. Allen also invested in numerous companies, including Ticketmaster, America Online, Egghead Software and the pharmaceutical company Darwin Molecular Corporation. Later investments focused on cable television, wireless modems, and Web portals. In 1992, Allen founded Interval Research, a think tank focused on the Internet and compatible technologies. "For years now, I've been interested in the information superhighway or whatever you want to call it," Allen told Fortune in 1995. "The approach I've chosen is to start companies or make strategic investments in companies I think are positioned to take advantage of that huge opportunity. I try to add value as an investor by building synergy between those companies." His ventures have met with varying degrees of success.Supported Sports, EntertainmentAllen also began to channel funds into entertainment and sporting ventures. He purchased the National Basketball Association's Portland Trailblazers in 1988 and built the organization a $262 million sports and entertainment complex. He often flies the team to games in his private jet. In the 1990s, he purchased a reported 24 percent of the shares of the film and television studio Dreamworks SKG. He purchased the National Football League's Seattle Seahawks in 1997 and built that team a new stadium and exhibition center as well.A longtime rock music fan with his own band, Allen channeled his love for guitarist Jimi Hendrix into the Experience Music Project, an interactive museum dedicated to rock music and especially Hendrix's work, which opened in Seattle in 2000. Allen celebrated an even earlier passion with his support of the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame, which opened in Seattle in 2004. Allen further indulged his interest in the otherworldly with a $13.5 million donation to the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence and the provision of an undisclosed amount to fund SpaceShipOne, the world's first private spaceship. Allen also founded the $100 million Allen Institute for Brain Science in 2003. Additional charitable donations and foundations have funded hospitals, AIDS programs, cancer research, forest preservation, and the construction of a new library at the University of Washington in honor of his parents. Allen resigned from the Microsoft Board of Directors in 2000, but remained with the organization as a senior strategy advisor.BooksBusiness Leader Profiles for Students, Volume 1, Gale Group, 1999.PeriodicalsFortune, October 2, 1995.People, June 19, 1995.Online"Paul Allen," Biography Resource Center website,http://galenet.galegroup.com (December 10, 2005).Space.com,http://www.space.com (November 16, 2004).
(1891–1940) [Bi]A mechanical engineer who pioneered the use of aerial photography for archaeological research. Born in Oxford, he was educated at Boxgrove School, Guildford, and Clifton College, before attending the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich. He resigned his commission, however, to become an engineer, working for some years on the east coast of Africa. During WW1 he served in the Royal Tank Corps, after the war joining his family business and finding time to become an enthusiastic airman. Piloting his own aircraft, the first privately owned aircraft in Oxford, and using a hand-made camera, he became well known for his pictures of archaeological sites in the Oxford area, which were mostly taken between 1933 and 1938. In 1936 he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He was killed in a motor-cycle accident in November 1940.[Bio.: D. N. Riley, 1984, Introduction. Aerial Archaeology, 10, 1–16]
Paul Gardner Allen (born January 21, 1953) is an American inventor, investor and philanthropist, best known as the co-founder, with Bill Gates, of Microsoft Corporation. As of March 2012, he was estimated to be the 48th-richest person in the world, with an estimated wealth of $14.2 billion.[1]
He is the founder and chairman of Vulcan Inc., which manages his various business and philanthropic efforts. Allen also has a multi-billion dollar investment portfolio which includes technology companies, real estate holdings, and stakes in other technology, media, and content companies. Allen also owns two professional sports teams, the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL),[2] and the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).[3] He is also part-owner of the Seattle Sounders FC, which joined Major League Soccer (MLS) in 2009.[4] Allen's memoir Idea Man: A Memoir by the Cofounder of Microsoft was released on April 19, 2011. The paperback version of Idea Man, which included a new epilogue, came out on October 30, 2012.[5]
Paul Allen was born in Seattle, Washington, to parents Kenneth Samuel Allen, an associate director of the University of Washington libraries, and Edna Faye (née Gardner) Allen, on January 21, 1953.[6] Allen attended Lakeside School, a private school in Seattle, and befriended Bill Gates, who was almost three years younger and shared a common enthusiasm for computers.[7] They used Lakeside's Teletype terminal to develop their programming skills on several time-sharing computer systems.[8] After earning a perfect score of 1600 on the SAT, Allen went to Washington State University but dropped out after two years in order to work as a programmer for Honeywell in Boston, placing him near his old friend again.[8] Allen later convinced Gates to drop out of Harvard University in order to create Microsoft.
Allen co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1975, and began marketing a BASIC programming language interpreter.[7] Allen came up with the original name of "Micro-Soft," as recounted in a 1995 Fortune magazine article.[9] In 1980, after promising to deliver IBM a Disk Operating System (DOS) they had not yet developed for the Intel 8088-based IBM PC, Allen spearheaded a deal for Microsoft to purchase a Quick and Dirty Operating System (QDOS) written by Tim Paterson who, at the time, was employed at Seattle Computer Products. As a result of this transaction, Microsoft was able to secure a contract to supply the DOS that would eventually run on IBM's PC line. This contract with IBM was the watershed in Microsoft history that led to Allen and Gates' wealth.[8]
Allen was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1982. His cancer was successfully treated by several months of radiation therapy. However, he did not return to Microsoft and began distancing himself from the company.[8] Allen officially resigned from his position on the Microsoft Board of Directors in November 2000 but was asked to consult as a senior strategy advisor to the company's executives.[10] He sold 68 million shares of Microsoft stock that year,[11] but still owns a reported 138 million shares.[12]
He received the Vanguard Award from the National Cable & Telecommunications Association on May 20, 2008.
On October 30, 2008, the Seattle-King County Association of Realtors honored Allen for his “unwavering commitment to nonprofit organizations in the Pacific Northwest and lifetime giving approaching US$1 billion.”[14][15]
Allen has received awards and honorary degrees from several universities. In May 1999, Washington State University bestowed its highest honor, the Regents' Distinguished Alumnus Award, upon him. He received a Docteur honoris causa from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne on March 31, 2007.
On October 26, 2008, Allen was given the Herbie Hancock Humanitarian Award from the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz for his "visionary achievements as a businessman and a global philanthropist."[16]
Paul Allen has made contributions to organizations related to health and human services, and toward the advancement of science and technology. The Paul G. Allen Family Foundation was established in 1986 to administer most of his contributions.[17] Through the Foundation, Allen awards approximately $30 million in grants annually.[18] Roughly 60% of the Foundation's money goes to non-profit organizations in Seattle and the state of Washington, and 12% to Portland, Oregon. The remaining 28% is distributed to other cities within the Pacific Northwest and internationally.[18] Since 1990, The Paul G. Allen Family Foundation has awarded $428 million to non-profit organizations, as of 2010.[19] That includes charitable projects known as "venture philanthropy". The most famous of these projects are the Experience Music Project, Seattle Cinerama Theatre, the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame, the Flying Heritage Collection (airworthy vintage military aircraft) and the Allen Telescope Array (ATA).[19] The ATA is a partnership between the University of California, Berkeley and the SETI Institute.[20] Allen has a flower fly named after him for his contributions to Dipterology, called Paul Allen's flower fly.[21] Allen has also funded the purchase of many Jimi Hendrix artifacts, including the guitar Hendrix played at Woodstock, and ensured their public display in the Experience Music Project exhibits.[22]
In December 2010, it was announced that Allen had pledged $26 million to his alma mater, Washington State University, for its School for Global Animal Health. The gift will be the largest received by the university. In the late 1980s, Allen donated US$18 million to build a new library at the University of Washington, named after his father, Kenneth S. Allen.[23] US$5 million was donated in 2003 to establish the Faye G. Allen Center for Visual Arts, named after his mother.[24] Allen was also the top private contributor, with US$14 million in donations, and namesake, of the "Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science & Engineering", which was designed by LMN Architects of Seattle and completed in 2003.[25] Throughout the years, Allen has contributed millions of US$ to the University of Washington Medical School.[26] The foundation awarded US$3.2 million for prostatitis research in 1997, followed by an additional $1.0 million grant in 2002.[27] More recently, the foundation contributed $5.0 million for an early cancer-detection project at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.[28]
Along with his sister Jo Lynn, Allen pledged $100 million in 2003 to found the Allen Institute for Brain Science, a nonprofit corporation (501(c) (3)) and medical research organization. Utilizing the mouse model system (given its great similarity to human DNA), 20,000 genes in the adult mouse brain were mapped to a cellular level for the Allen Brain Atlas. The data generated from this effort is contained in the free and publicly available Allen Brain Atlas application.
On July 16, 2008, Allen launched a $41 million online "Allen Spinal Cord Atlas" mouse gene map. Allan Jones, chief scientific officer, said: "The Allen Spinal Cord Atlas offers profound potential for researchers to unlock the mysteries of the spinal cord and how it is altered during disease or injury." The spinal cord atlas is set up like the Allen Institute's earlier atlas of the mouse brain.[29] The Map could reveal new treatments for human neurological disorders. The map points researchers toward places where genes are active[30][31][32]
On November 19, 2008, Allen appeared at the Experience Music Project/Science Fiction Hall of Fame to present the second annual Founder's Award for musical achievement. The award was presented to Robbie Robertson, a founding member of the seminal 1960s band The Band and a noted composer of film scores. Allen founded the museum in 2000. The award was presented as part of a gala benefit for EMP. The finale was a four-song set with all the evening's musicians on stage, including Allen and Robertson on guitar.
Paul Allen is also a founding member of The International SeaKeepers Society and hosts its proprietary SeaKeeper 1000TM oceanographic and atmospheric monitoring system on all three of his megayachts.
On November 15, 2009, Jody Allen, Paul Allen's sister and the CEO of Vulcan made public that Paul had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a form of cancer in the lymph system. Since October 2010, he has been free of cancer.[33]
On May 24, 2010, Allen launched the Allen Human Brain Atlas, a publicly available online atlas charting genes at work throughout the human brain. The data provided represent the most extensive and detailed body of information about gene activity in the human brain to date, documenting which genes are expressed, or "turned on" where.[34]
A report in February, 2012, named Allen as the most charitable living American in 2011. Allen's donations, totaling $372.6 million, were beat out by only two others, both of them are deceased.[35]
In March 2012 he continued the funding of the Allen Institute for Brain Science with a contribution of $300 million to look at how we see.[36][37]
Paul Allen (third from right) and Burt Rutan (fifth from right) were presented with the Ansari X PRIZE by members of the X PRIZE Foundation in 2004.
In 1993, Paul Allen invested $243 million to acquire 80% of Ticketmaster. Under his ownership, Ticketmaster moved into the Internet in two phases: it started in June 1995 by displaying a searchable database of Ticketmaster's events; on September 11, 1996, the first transaction came in. The company went public on 19 November 1996. In 1997, David Geffen introduced Barry Diller to Allen, who was increasingly frustrated at Fred Rosen, Ticketmaster's CEO, and was looking for a change at the helm. In May of that year, Home Shopping Network acquired 47.5% of Allen's stock for $209 million worth of HSN stock.[39]
In 1992, he and David Liddle cofounded Interval Research Corporation, a Silicon Valley-based laboratory and new business incubator that was dissolved in 2000 after generating over 300 patents,[40] four of which were the subject of Allen's August 2010 patent infringement lawsuit against AOL, Apple, eBay, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Office Depot, OfficeMax, Staples, Yahoo!, and YouTube.[41][42]
Allen confirmed that he was the sole investor behind Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites' SpaceShipOne suborbital commercial spacecraft on October 4, 2004.[43] SpaceShipOne climbed to an altitude of 377,591 feet (115,090 m) and was the first privately funded effort to successfully put a civilian in suborbital space. It won the Ansari X Prize competition and received the $10 million prize.[44]
On December 13, 2011, Allen announced Stratolaunch Systems. Stratolaunch is a proposed orbital launch system consisting of a dual-bodied, 6 engine jet aircraft, capable of carrying a rocket to high altitude; the rocket would then separate from its carrier aircraft and fire its own engines to complete its climb into orbit. The carrier aircraft would utilize carbon composites as well as 747 jet engines and parts. If successful, this project would be the first wholly privately funded space transport system.[45]
Allen was a key developer and investor in the development of the South Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle as a biotechnology hub and mixed-use community.[46] He was also the largest private landowner in South Lake Union and owns nearly 2,600,000 square feet (240,000 m2) in the neighborhood.[46] His holdings company has a development capacity of more than 10,000,000 square feet (930,000 m2) of new residential, office, retail and biotech research space.[46] The South Lake Union redevelopment represents one of the largest urban revitalization projects in the country.[47] Allen has made investments estimated at US$200 million as of 2005[update], and promoted for city funding of the Seattle Streetcar line known as South Lake Union Streetcar, which runs from Seattle's Westlake Center to the south end of Lake Union.[48] The Streetcar is a public and private partnership made possible because of a Local Improvement District (LID) supported by businesses and residents along the line;[49] it officially started operation on December 12, 2007.[50] This development has been criticized as a city-supported real estate investment for Vulcan Inc.,[51] and concerns over the loss of low-income housing have been expressed.[52]
The launch of Paul Allen's 414 feet (126 m) yacht, Octopus, secured its position as one of the world's largest yachts in 2003.[53] As of 2011[update], it is 12th in the list of motor yachts by length. The yacht is equipped with two helicopters, two submarines, a swimming pool, a music studio and a basketball court.[54] Allen also owns Tatoosh, also one of the world's 100 largest yachts.
Allen is known for throwing huge, celebrity-studded parties on his yacht, such as a 2005 New Year's Eve party in which he and his band played Johnny Cash songs with R&B star Usher. His band also played at another party he hosted during the Cannes film festival with keyboardist Dave Stewart.[54][55][56]
Allen purchased the Portland Trail Blazers NBA team in 1988 from California real estate developer Larry Weinberg for $70 million.[3] He was also instrumental in the development and funding of their Rose Garden in 1993.[8] The Blazers are valued at approximately $300 million according to a 2006 issue of Forbes.[57] Allen has been asking Portland and Oregon officials for assistance in the financing of the Blazers since 2006, which he estimated would lose $100 million over the next three years.[58] Then-Portland Mayor Tom Potter rebuffed the requests.[59] Allen announced the completion of the acquisition of the Rose Garden on April 2, 2007, and stated that this was a major milestone and a positive step for the franchise.[60] He said, “My efforts are focused on continuing to support the Trail Blazers and the long-term financial health of the franchise."[61] As of 2010, according to a 2011 issue of Forbes, the Portland Trail Blazers were worth $356 million, ranked No. 14 out of 30 NBA teams.[62]
Allen purchased the Seattle Seahawks NFL team in 1997 when former owner Ken Behring threatened to move the Seahawks to Southern California.[2]
Allen's Vulcan Sports & Entertainment is part of the ownership team of the Seattle Sounders FC, a Major League Soccer franchise that began play in 2009 at CenturyLink Field, a stadium also controlled by Paul Allen.[4] The ownership team also includes film producer Joe Roth, businessman Adrian Hanauer, and comedian Drew Carey. Sigi Schmid, two-time MLS Cup winner, is the team’s head coach.
The Sounders sold out every home game during its first season, setting a new MLS record for average match attendance and the most season tickets sold in the league. The team finished the 2009 season with a winning record and qualified for the MLS playoffs, where they were eliminated in the conference semi-finals. Seattle Sounders FC is only the second expansion team in MLS history to win the U.S. Open Cup tournament in its first season, and in 2010 became the first team to repeat as U.S. Open Cup champion in almost three decades, in front of the largest crowd to ever witness a Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final in the history of the 97-year-old tournament.
On January 26, 2011 at Seattle’s Benaroya Hall, Paul Allen was named Seattle Sports Commission Sports Citizen of the Year, an award that has been renamed the Paul Allen Award.

'This tiny sliver of land... changed the course of human history':The Queen and Obama lead tributes to D-Day heroes as world leaders join veterans for emotional return to Normandy beaches
        Surrounded by thousands of war graves Her Majesty bowed as she laid a wreath during a poignant service of remembrance in Bayeux, the first town in Normandy to be freed from Hitler's grip after the invasion on June 6 1944. Ten miles away U.S. President Barack Obama spoke at the American War Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer where almost 10,000 U.S troops who died in the Second World War are buried. Flanked by veterans, President Obama said they and their comrades 'turned the tide in that common struggle for freedom' on D-Day. At dawn those who stormed the beaches of Normandy exactly 70 years ago saluted the English Channel to mark the moment the D-Day assault started.

       Harold Baumgarten, 89, of Jacksonville Beach, Florida, has described how he could look out at the beaches of northern France and point to where the bodies lay. He has returned to the beaches of Normandy to remember his fallen comrades. The former US soldier was just 19 years old when he jumped off the landing craft and, 70 years on, has paid tribute to the 9,387 Americans who fell during the invasion, suggesting they are the reason he arrived safely back home.
