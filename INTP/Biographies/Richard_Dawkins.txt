From Chapter One – “I grew up in a world of violence and unpredictability. I learned to protect myself the best I could. I learned to take care of myself because no one else would. I learned to lie, to conceal, and to cover my fear with anger and violence.
No one knew the abuse that went on in our home, as we all learned to keep it hidden. No one knew my wish to make it stop. And later, no one knew the fear that overwhelmed me and drove me to hit and hurt the ones I loved most.”
This book exposes the thinking, beliefs and actions of a child who grows up to find himself being the abuser in his family. We follow his story from before childhood to the beginning of his journey to stop his violent and abusive behaviors.
Lee Cox offers powerful insights into his journey of healing himself. When he shares his story, his courage, candor and honesty inspire his audience to help stop domestic abuse. Lee speaks to: Students, Teachers, Law Enforcement, Domestic Violence Professionals, Civic organizations, Self Help groups and Community Leaders. Contact the EVE Foundation to have Lee speak at your next event.

Clinton Richard Dawkins /ˈdɔːkɨnz/, DSc, FRS, FRSL (born 26 March 1941) is an English[2] ethologist, evolutionary biologist,[3] and writer. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford,[4] and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008.[5]
Dawkins came to prominence with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term meme. In 1982, he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism's body, but can stretch far into the environment, including the bodies of other organisms; this concept is presented in his book The Extended Phenotype.[6]
Dawkins is an atheist, a vice president of the British Humanist Association, and a supporter of the Brights movement.[7] He is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design. In his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker.
He has since written several popular science books, and makes regular television and radio appearances, predominantly discussing these topics. In his 2006 book The God Delusion, Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion—"a fixed false belief".[8]:5 As of January 2010, the English-language version had sold more than two million copies and had been translated into 31 languages.[9]
Dawkins was born in Nairobi, Kenya.[10] He is the son of Jean Mary Vyvyan (née Ladner) and Clinton John Dawkins (1915–2010), who was an agricultural civil servant in the British Colonial Service in Nyasaland (now Malawi).[11][12]
Dawkins has a younger sister.[13] His father was called up into the King's African Rifles during World War II;[14][15] he returned to England in 1949, when Dawkins was eight. His father had inherited a country estate, Over Norton Park in Oxfordshire, which he turned into a commercial farm.[11] Both his parents were interested in natural sciences; they answered Dawkins's questions in scientific terms.[16]
Dawkins describes his childhood as "a normal Anglican upbringing".[17] He was a Christian until halfway through his teenage years, at which point he concluded that the theory of evolution was a better explanation for life's complexity, and ceased believing in a god.[13] Dawkins states: "the main residual reason why I was religious was from being so impressed with the complexity of life and feeling that it had to have a designer, and I think it was when I realised that Darwinism was a far superior explanation that pulled the rug out from under the argument of design. And that left me with nothing."[13]
Dawkins attended Oundle School in Northamptonshire, an English public school with a distinct Church of England flavour,[13] from 1954 to 1959, where he was in Laundimer house.[18] He studied zoology at Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1962; while there, he was tutored by Nobel Prize-winning ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen. He continued as a research student under Tinbergen's supervision, receiving his MA and DPhil degrees by 1966, and remained a research assistant for another year.[10] Tinbergen was a pioneer in the study of animal behaviour, particularly in the areas of instinct, learning and choice;[19] Dawkins's research in this period concerned models of animal decision-making.[20]
From 1967 to 1969, he was an assistant professor of zoology at the University of California, Berkeley. During this period, the students and faculty at UC Berkeley were largely opposed to the ongoing Vietnam War, and Dawkins became heavily involved in the anti-war demonstrations and activities.[21] He returned to the University of Oxford in 1970, taking a position as a lecturer. In 1990, he became a reader in zoology. In 1995, he was appointed Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford, a position that had been endowed by Charles Simonyi with the express intention that the holder "be expected to make important contributions to the public understanding of some scientific field",[22] and that its first holder should be Richard Dawkins.[23]
Since 1970, he has been a fellow of New College, Oxford.[24] He has delivered a number of inaugural and other lectures, including the Henry Sidgwick Memorial Lecture (1989), the first Erasmus Darwin Memorial Lecture (1990), the Michael Faraday Lecture (1991), the T. H. Huxley Memorial Lecture (1992), the Irvine Memorial Lecture (1997), the Sheldon Doyle Lecture (1999), the Tinbergen Lecture (2004) and the Tanner Lectures (2003).[10] In 1991, he gave the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures for Children on Growing Up in the Universe. He has also served as editor of a number of journals, and has acted as editorial advisor to the Encarta Encyclopedia and the Encyclopedia of Evolution. He is a senior editor of the Council for Secular Humanism's Free Inquiry magazine, for which he also writes a column. He has been a member of the editorial board of Skeptic magazine since its foundation.[25]
He has sat on judging panels for awards as diverse as the Royal Society's Faraday Award and the British Academy Television Awards,[26] and has been president of the Biological Sciences section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2004, Balliol College, Oxford instituted the Dawkins Prize, awarded for "outstanding research into the ecology and behaviour of animals whose welfare and survival may be endangered by human activities".[27] In September 2008, he retired from his professorship, announcing plans to "write a book aimed at youngsters in which he will warn them against believing in 'anti-scientific' fairytales."[28]
Dawkins has been married three times, and has one daughter. On 19 August 1967, Dawkins married fellow ethologist Marian Stamp in Annestown, County Waterford, Ireland;[29] they divorced in 1984. Later that same year, on 1 June, he married Eve Barham (19 August 1951[30]–28 February 1999) in Oxford. They had a daughter, Juliet Emma Dawkins (born 1984, Oxford).[30] Dawkins and Barham also divorced.[31] In 1992, he married actress Lalla Ward[31] in Kensington and Chelsea, London.[30] Dawkins met her through their mutual friend Douglas Adams,[32] who had worked with her on the BBC's Doctor Who.
In his scientific works, Dawkins is best known for his popularisation of the gene as the principal unit of selection in evolution; this view is most clearly set out in his books:[33]
The Selfish Gene (1976), in which he notes that "all life evolves by the differential survival of replicating entities".
The Extended Phenotype (1982), in which he describes natural selection as "the process whereby replicators out-propagate each other".
Dawkins has consistently been sceptical about non-adaptive processes in evolution (such as spandrels, described by Gould and Lewontin)[34] and about selection at levels "above" that of the gene.[35] He is particularly sceptical about the practical possibility or importance of group selection as a basis for understanding altruism.[8]:169–172 This behaviour appears at first to be an evolutionary paradox, since helping others costs precious resources and decreases one's own fitness. Previously, many had interpreted this as an aspect of group selection: Individuals are doing what is best for the survival of the population or species as a whole. British evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton had used the gene-centred view to explain altruism in terms of inclusive fitness and kin selection—that individuals behave altruistically toward their close relatives, who share many of their own genes.[36][a] Similarly, Robert Trivers, thinking in terms of the gene-centred model, developed the theory of reciprocal altruism, whereby one organism provides a benefit to another in the expectation of future reciprocation.[37] Dawkins popularised these ideas in The Selfish Gene, and developed them in his own work.[38]
He has also been strongly critical of the Gaia hypothesis of the independent scientist James Lovelock.[39][40][41]
In June 2012 Dawkins was highly critical of fellow biologist E.O. Wilson's 2012 book The Social Conquest of Earth.[42]
Critics of Dawkins's approach suggest that taking the gene as the unit of selection (a single event in which an individual either succeeds or fails to reproduce) is misleading; the gene could be better described, they say, as a unit of evolution (the long-term changes in allele frequencies in a population).[43] In The Selfish Gene, Dawkins explains that he is using George C. Williams's definition of the gene as "that which segregates and recombines with appreciable frequency."[44] Another common objection is that a gene cannot survive alone, but must cooperate with other genes to build an individual, and therefore a gene cannot be an independent "unit".[45] In The Extended Phenotype, Dawkins suggests that from an individual gene's viewpoint, all other genes are part of the environment to which it is adapted.
Advocates for higher levels of selection (such as Richard Lewontin, David Sloan Wilson, and Elliott Sober) suggest that there are many phenomena (including altruism) that gene-based selection cannot satisfactorily explain. The philosopher Mary Midgley, with whom Dawkins clashed in print concerning The Selfish Gene,[46][47] has criticised gene selection, memetics, and sociobiology as being excessively reductionist;[48] she has suggested that the popularity of Dawkins's work is due to factors in the Zeitgeist such as the increased individualism of the Thatcher/Reagan decades.[49]
In a set of controversies over the mechanisms and interpretation of evolution (what has been called 'The Darwin Wars'),[50][51] one faction is often named after Dawkins, while the other faction is named after the American palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould, reflecting the pre-eminence of each as a populariser of the pertinent ideas.[52][53] In particular, Dawkins and Gould have been prominent commentators in the controversy over sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, with Dawkins generally approving and Gould generally being critical.[54] A typical example of Dawkins's position is his scathing review of Not in Our Genes by Steven Rose, Leon J. Kamin, and Richard C. Lewontin.[55] Two other thinkers who are often considered to be allied with Dawkins on the subject are Steven Pinker and Daniel Dennett; Dennett has promoted a gene-centred view of evolution and defended reductionism in biology.[56] Despite their academic disagreements, Dawkins and Gould did not have a hostile personal relationship, and Dawkins dedicated a large portion of his 2003 book A Devil's Chaplain posthumously to Gould, who had died the previous year.
Dawkins's book The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution expounds the evidence for biological evolution,[57] and coincided with Darwin's bicentennial year.[58]
Dawkins coined the word meme (the behavioural equivalent of a gene) as a way to encourage readers to think about how Darwinian principles might be extended beyond the realm of genes.[59]:11 Indeed, it was intended as an extension of his "replicators" argument, but it took on a life of its own in the hands of other authors such as Daniel Dennett and Susan Blackmore. These popularisations then led to the emergence of memetics, a field from which Dawkins has distanced himself.[60]
Dawkins's meme refers to any cultural entity that an observer might consider a replicator of a certain idea or complex of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through exposure to humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that is analogous to the theory of biological evolution based on genes.[61]
Although Dawkins invented the specific term meme independently, he has not claimed that the idea itself was entirely novel,[62] and there have been other expressions for similar ideas in the past. For instance, John Laurent has suggested that the term may have derived from the work of the little-known German biologist Richard Semon.[63] In 1904, Semon published Die Mneme (which appeared in English in 1924 as The Mneme). This book discusses the cultural transmission of experiences, with insights parallel to those of Dawkins. Laurent also found the term mneme used in Maurice Maeterlinck's The Life of the White Ant (1926), and has highlighted the similarities to Dawkins's concept.[63] Author James Gleick describes Dawkins's concept of the meme as "his most famous memorable invention, far more influential than his selfish genes or his later proselytizing against religiosity".[64]
Dawkins is a prominent critic of creationism (the religious belief that humanity, life, and the universe were created by a deity[65] without recourse to evolution[66]). He has described the Young Earth creationist view that the Earth is only a few thousand years old as "a preposterous, mind-shrinking falsehood",[67] and his 1986 book, The Blind Watchmaker, contains a sustained critique of the argument from design, an important creationist argument. In the book, Dawkins argues against the watchmaker analogy made famous by the 18th-century English theologian William Paley via his book Natural Theology, in which Paley argues that just as a watch is too complicated and too functional to have sprung into existence merely by accident, so too must all living things—with their far greater complexity—be purposefully designed. Dawkins shares the view generally held by scientists that natural selection is sufficient to explain the apparent functionality and non-random complexity of the biological world, and can be said to play the role of watchmaker in nature, albeit as an automatic, nonintelligent, blind watchmaker.[68]
In 1986, Dawkins and biologist John Maynard Smith participated in an Oxford Union debate against A. E. Wilder-Smith (a Young Earth creationist) and Edgar Andrews (president of the Biblical Creation Society).[b] In general, however, Dawkins has followed the advice of his late colleague Stephen Jay Gould and refused to participate in formal debates with creationists because "what they seek is the oxygen of respectability", and doing so would "give them this oxygen by the mere act of engaging with them at all". He suggests that creationists "don't mind being beaten in an argument. What matters is that we give them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public."[69]
In a December 2004 interview with American journalist Bill Moyers, Dawkins said that "among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know." When Moyers questioned him on the use of the word theory, Dawkins stated that "evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening." He added that "it is rather like a detective coming on a murder after the scene... the detective hasn't actually seen the murder take place, of course. But what you do see is a massive clue... Huge quantities of circumstantial evidence. It might as well be spelled out in words of English."[70]
Dawkins has ardently opposed the inclusion of intelligent design in science education, describing it as "not a scientific argument at all, but a religious one".[71] He has been referred to in the media as "Darwin's Rottweiler",[72] a reference to English biologist T. H. Huxley, who was known as "Darwin's Bulldog" for his advocacy of Charles Darwin's evolutionary ideas. He has been a strong critic of the British organisation Truth in Science, which promotes the teaching of creationism in state schools, and he plans through the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science to subsidise schools with the delivery of books, DVDs, and pamphlets that counteract their (Truth in Science's) work, which Dawkins has described as an "educational scandal".[73]
Dawkins is an outspoken atheist[74] and a supporter of various atheist, secular, and humanistic organisations.[10][75][76][77][78][79][80] Although he was confirmed into the Church of England at the age of thirteen, he started to lose his religious faith when he discovered Darwin.[81] He revealed that his understanding of evolution led him to atheism[82] and is puzzled by belief in God among individuals who are sophisticated in science.[83] He disagrees with Stephen Jay Gould's principle of nonoverlapping magisteria[84] and considers the existence of God to be a scientific hypothesis like any other.[8]:50
Dawkins became a prominent critic of religion and has stated his opposition to religion is twofold: Religion is both a source of conflict and a justification for belief without evidence.[8]:282–286 He considers faith—belief that is not based on evidence—as "one of the world's great evils".[85] He rose to prominence in public debates relating science and religion since the publication of his book The God Delusion in 2006, which became an international best seller.[86] Its success has been seen by many as indicative of a change in the contemporary cultural zeitgeist and has also been identified with the rise of New Atheism.[87]
Dawkins sees education and consciousness-raising as the primary tools in opposing what he considers to be religious dogma and indoctrination.[21][88][89] These tools include the fight against certain stereotypes, and he has adopted the term bright as a way of associating positive public connotations with those who possess a naturalistic worldview.[89] He has given support to the idea of a free thinking school,[90] which would not indoctrinate children in atheism or in any religion but would instead teach children to be critical and open-minded.[91][92] Inspired by the consciousness-raising successes of feminists in arousing widespread embarrassment at the routine use of "he" instead of "she", Dawkins similarly suggests that phrases such as "Catholic child" and "Muslim child" should be considered as socially absurd as, for instance, "Marxist child", as he believes that children should not be classified based on their parents' ideological or religious beliefs.[89]
Dawkins suggests that atheists should be proud, not apologetic, stressing that atheism is evidence of a healthy, independent mind.[8]:3 He hopes that the more atheists identify themselves, the more the public will become aware of just how many people actually hold these views, thereby reducing the negative opinion of atheism among the religious majority.[93][94] Inspired by the gay rights movement, he founded the Out Campaign to encourage atheists worldwide to declare their stance publicly and proudly.[95] He supported the UK's first atheist advertising initiative, the Atheist Bus Campaign in 2008, which aimed to raise funds to place atheist advertisements on buses in the London area.
Dawkins's advocacy of atheism has been controversial. Writer Christopher Hitchens defended the perceived stridency of Dawkins's stance towards religion while Nobel laureates Sir Harold Kroto and James D. Watson and psychologist Steven Pinker lavished praise on his book The God Delusion.[96][97] In contrast, literary critic Terry Eagleton, theologian Alister McGrath, and science philosopher Michael Ruse[98][99] have accused Dawkins of having fundamentally misapprehended the theological arguments he claimed to refute, while scientists Martin Rees and Peter Higgs have criticised Dawkins's confrontational stance towards religion as unhelpful, with Higgs going as far as to label him a fundamentalist.[100][101][102][103][104] In response to his critics, Dawkins maintains that theologians are no better than scientists in addressing deep cosmological questions and that he himself is not a fundamentalist as he is willing to change his mind in the face of new evidence.[8]:55–56[105][106] Recently, in May 2014, at the Hay Festival in Wales, Dawkins was quoted as saying, "I would describe myself as a secular Christian in the same sense as secular Jews have a feeling for nostalgia and ceremonies." [107]
In 2006, Dawkins founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science (RDFRS), a non-profit organisation. The foundation is in a developmental phase. It has been granted charitable status in the United Kingdom and the United States. RDFRS plans to finance research on the psychology of belief and religion, finance scientific education programs and materials, and publicise and support charitable organisations that are secular in nature. The foundation also offers humanist, rationalist, and scientific materials through its website.[108]
Dawkins has said the "trend toward theocratic thinking in the United States is a danger not only for America but for the entire world."[109] Connected to this concern, Dawkins invited Sean Faircloth to serve as opening speaker on Dawkins's 2011 US book tour. Faircloth is author of the book Attack of the Theocrats, How the Religious Right Harms Us All and What We Can Do About It. The Richard Dawkins Foundation (United States branch) later hired Faircloth, who has ten years experience as a state legislator, as Director of Strategy and Policy.[109]
In his role as professor for public understanding of science, Dawkins has been a critic of pseudoscience and alternative medicine. His 1998 book Unweaving the Rainbow considers John Keats's accusation that by explaining the rainbow, Isaac Newton diminished its beauty; Dawkins argues for the opposite conclusion. He suggests that deep space, the billions of years of life's evolution, and the microscopic workings of biology and heredity contain more beauty and wonder than do "myths" and "pseudoscience".[110] For John Diamond's posthumously published Snake Oil, a book devoted to debunking alternative medicine, Dawkins wrote a foreword in which he asserts that alternative medicine is harmful, if only because it distracts patients from more successful conventional treatments and gives people false hopes.[111] Dawkins states that "there is no alternative medicine. There is only medicine that works and medicine that doesn't work."[112]
Dawkins has expressed concern about the growth of the planet's human population and about the matter of overpopulation.[113] In The Selfish Gene, he briefly mentions population growth, giving the example of Latin America, whose population, at the time the book was written, was doubling every 40 years. He is critical of Roman Catholic attitudes to family planning and population control, stating that leaders who forbid contraception and "express a preference for 'natural' methods of population limitation" will get just such a method in the form of starvation.[59]:213
As a supporter of the Great Ape Project—a movement to extend certain moral and legal rights to all great apes—Dawkins contributed the article "Gaps in the Mind" to the Great Ape Project book edited by Paola Cavalieri and Peter Singer. In this essay, he criticises contemporary society's moral attitudes as being based on a "discontinuous, speciesist imperative".[114]
Dawkins also regularly comments in newspapers and weblogs on contemporary political questions; his opinions include opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq,[115] the British nuclear deterrent, the actions of US President, George W. Bush.[116] and the ethics of designer babies.[117] Several such articles were included in A Devil's Chaplain, an anthology of writings about science, religion, and politics. He is also a supporter of the Republic's campaign to replace the British monarchy with a democratically elected president.[118] Dawkins has described himself as a Labour voter in the 1970s[119] and voter for the Liberal Democrats since the party's creation.[120] In 2009, he spoke at the party's conference in opposition to blasphemy laws, alternative medicine, and faith schools. In the UK general election of 2010, Dawkins officially endorsed the Liberal Democrats, in support of their campaign for electoral reform and for their "refusal to pander to 'faith'."[121]
In the 2007 TV documentary The Enemies of Reason,[122] Dawkins discusses what he sees as the dangers of abandoning critical thought and rationale based upon scientific evidence. He specifically cites astrology, spiritualism, dowsing, alternative faiths, alternative medicine, and homoeopathy. He also discusses how the Internet can be used to spread religious hatred and conspiracy theories with scant attention to evidence-based reasoning.
Continuing a long-standing partnership with Channel 4, Dawkins participated in a five-part television series Genius of Britain, along with fellow scientists Stephen Hawking, James Dyson, Paul Nurse, and Jim Al-Khalili. The five-episode series was broadcast in June 2010. The series focuses on major British scientific achievements throughout history.[123]
In a More4 documentary entitled Faith School Menace? and presented by Dawkins, he argues "for us to reconsider the consequences of faith education, which... bamboozles parents, and indoctrinates and divides children."[124][125]
These books are famous for their criticism of postmodernism in US universities (namely in the departments of literary studies, anthropology, and other cultural studies).[126] In the same occasion, Dawkins also criticised Cambridge University for awarding philosopher Jacques Derrida an honorary doctorate.[126]
In 2011, Dawkins joined the professoriate of the New College of the Humanities, a new private university in London established by A. C. Grayling, which opened in September 2012.[127]
Dawkins was awarded a Doctor of Science by the University of Oxford in 1989. He holds honorary doctorates in science from the University of Huddersfield, University of Westminster, Durham University,[128] the University of Hull, the University of Antwerp, and the University of Oslo,[129] and honorary doctorates from the University of Aberdeen,[130] Open University, the Vrije Universiteit Brussel,[10] and the University of Valencia.[131] He also holds honorary doctorates of letters from the University of St Andrews and the Australian National University (HonLittD, 1996), and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1997 and the Royal Society in 2001.[10] He is one of the patrons of the Oxford University Scientific Society.
In 1987, Dawkins received a Royal Society of Literature award and a Los Angeles Times Literary Prize for his book The Blind Watchmaker. In the same year, he received a Sci. Tech Prize for Best Television Documentary Science Programme of the Year for his work on the BBC's Horizon episode The Blind Watchmaker.[10]
His other awards include the Zoological Society of London's Silver Medal (1989), the Finlay Innovation Award (1990), the Michael Faraday Award (1990), the Nakayama Prize (1994), the American Humanist Association's Humanist of the Year Award (1996), the fifth International Cosmos Prize (1997), the Kistler Prize (2001), the Medal of the Presidency of the Italian Republic (2001), the 2001 and 2012 Emperor Has No Clothes Award from the Freedom From Religion Foundation, the Bicentennial Kelvin Medal of The Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow (2002),[10] and the Nierenberg Prize for Science in the Public Interest (2009).[132]
Dawkins topped Prospect magazine's 2004 list of the top 100 public British intellectuals, as decided by the readers, receiving twice as many votes as the runner-up.[133][134] He was short-listed as a candidate in their 2008 follow-up poll.[135] In 2005, the Hamburg-based Alfred Toepfer Foundation awarded him its Shakespeare Prize in recognition of his "concise and accessible presentation of scientific knowledge". He won the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science for 2006, as well as the Galaxy British Book Awards's Author of the Year Award for 2007.[136] In the same year, he was listed by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2007,[137] and he was ranked 20th in The Daily Telegraph's 2007 list of 100 greatest living geniuses.[138] He was awarded the Deschner Award, named after German anti-clerical author Karlheinz Deschner.[139]
Since 2003, the Atheist Alliance International has awarded a prize during its annual conference, honouring an outstanding atheist whose work has done the most to raise public awareness of atheism during that year; it is known as the Richard Dawkins Award, in honour of Dawkins's own efforts.[140]
In February 2010, Dawkins was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation's Honorary Board of distinguished achievers.[141]
In 2012, ichthyologists in Sri Lanka honored Dawkins by creating Dawkinsia as a new genus name (members of this genus were formerly members of the genus Puntius). Explaining the reasoning behind the genus name, lead researcher Rohan Pethiyagoda was quoted as stating that "Richard Dawkins has, through his writings, helped us understand that the universe is far more beautiful and awe-inspiring than any religion has imagined [...] We hope that Dawkinsia will serve as a reminder of the elegance and simplicity of evolution, the only rational explanation there is for the unimaginable diversity of life on Earth.".[142]
In a poll held by Prospect magazine in 2013, Dawkins was voted the world's top thinker based on 65 names chosen by a largely US- and UK-based expert panel.[143]

                        Born in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1941, Professor Richard Dawkins is one of the world’s leading scientific intellectuals, specialising in evolutionary biology. After undertaking his doctorate under the instruction of Nobel-prize winning ethologist Niko Tinbergen at Berkeley University of California, in 1967 he was appointed Assistant Professor of Zoology at Berkeley Dawkins returned to Oxford University, where he gained his degree, before becoming a fellow at New College, Oxford in 1970. Professor Dawkins is an enormously successful writer. His first book, The Blind Watchmaker, published in 1976, was a huge success and has since been translated into 13 languages worldwide. His other books include: The Extended Phenotype (1982), The Selfish Gene (1989), River Our of Eden: A Darwinian View of Life (1995), Climbing Mount Improbable (1996), Unweaving the Rainbow (1997), A Devil’s Chaplain (2003), The Ancestor’s Tale (2004) and The God Delusion (2006).He has won countless awards and regularly lectures around the world. He widely accredits Charles Darwin as having a profound influence on his life and work, commenting in an interview with The National Geographic Channel Online that Darwin was “the founder of really everything that I do…whereas some people make a discovery and they stumble upon it, Darwin devoted himself to making his theory clear, to listing all the evidence and spending decades of his life gathering the evidence so no one could doubt it.” Find Out More About Professor Richard Dawkins at http://richarddawkins.net/

=======================================================
Clinton Richard Dawkins (born March 26, 1941, in Nairobi, Kenya) is a bestselling atheist popularizer of Darwinian evolutionary theory and its counter-religious implications. His scientific field is ethology, the study of animal behavior.
The most readily recognizable figure in the Darwin debate, Dawkins retired in 2008 as Professor for Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University, a position he held from 1995, by which time he had effectively discontinued his career as a publishing research scientist. His curriculum vitae gives no record of original, peer-reviewed scientific publications since 1994. His best known books include The Selfish Gene (1976), The Extended Phenotype (1982), The Blind Watchmaker (1986), and The God Delusion (2006). The last of these, widely influential and controversial, has sold 1.5 million copies in its English-language edition and been translated into 31 other languages.
He is currently married to the actress Lalla Ward and has a daughter, Juliet Emma Dawkins, from an earlier marriage.
Dawkins’ feelings about God are well summarized by a passage in The God Delusion in which he decries the Scriptural Divinity as “arguably the most unpleasant character in fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.”
Dawkins traces his atheistic beliefs to his childhood in England, where by his middle teenage years he was already convinced that the “argument from design” for God’s existence had been overthrown by Darwinian theory. His subsequent views on religion all follow from that realization and, according to critics, do not, in terms of sophistication, go very substantially beyond it. Dawkins is praised by friends and foes alike as a gifted science writer, a fact about him that may help explain his effectiveness as an ambassador for scientific atheism.
While functioning as Darwinism’s chief public spokesman, Dawkins takes what some regard as a paradoxical stance against public debate when there is a possibility that doubts about Darwinian theory may be aired. He personally refuses to debate the truth of Darwinian evolution, though Darwin’s defeat the design hypothesis is the premise of almost all Dawkins’ later activist writing on behalf of atheism. On one occasion, at almost the last moment, he backed out of a 2005 debate on National Public Radio with George Gilder upon being informed that Gilder, a Discovery Institute Senior Fellow, argues for intelligent design.
Politically, Dawkins has long been on the Left, going back to his teaching days as an assistant professor of zoology at U.C. Berkeley in 1967-69, when he joined in student anti-war demonstrations. He favors extending legal rights to Great Apes, saying that humanity’s failure to do so gives evidence of a “discontinuous, speciesist imperative.”
He has compared religious belief to the smallpox virus, regretting only that smallpox was much easier to eradicate.
In The Blind Watchmaker, his target was what he regards as the illusion of design in nature. The book includes his often quoted declaration that “Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist.”
While arguing against what he regards as the massive improbability of God’s existence may appear to be the major conclusion of Dawkins’s writing and speaking, on closer inspection many critics believe he takes divine non-existence as something closer to a premise.
In The God Delusion, the argument turns on whether God if He exists would have to be “complex.” Dawkins says He would have to be, and therefore would require Something even more complex than He is to explain His existence, leading to a hopeless infinite regress of complex deities all required to explain each others’ existence. But as the philosopher Alvin Plantinga notes, attributing such complexity to God as Dawkins does (in contrast with traditional theism, which hold God to be supremely simple) makes sense only given a premise of materialism. But materialism itself entails the nonexistence of a nonmaterial being such as God. So the argument is circular.
Others have wondered to what degree a will to disbelieve in religion drives Dawkins’ scientific thought, as opposed to atheism’s being the product of scientific inquiry as he himself maintains. Thus he is willing to embrace improbable if not laughable beliefs— for example, in space aliens—if they will save him from having to admit the possibility of religion’s truth. In an interview with lawyer and entertainer Ben Stein in the film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed (2008), Dawkins granted that the first life could indeed have been intelligently designed—only, not by God:
“Well, it could come about in the following way. It could be that at some earlier time, somewhere in the universe, a civilization evolved, probably by some kind of Darwinian means, probably to a very high level of technology, and designed a form of life that they seeded onto perhaps this planet. Now, um, now that is a possibility, and an intriguing possibility. And I suppose it's possible that you might find evidence for that if you look at the details of biochemistry, molecular biology, you might find a signature of some sort of designer.”
In a further twist on Dawkins’ own theological views, during a 2008 debate with Oxford mathematician John Lennox, Dawkins conceded that, “A serious case could be made for a deistic God.”
At the same time, Dawkins differs from some other Darwinian advocates in frankly asserting that no reconciliation is possible between Darwinian theory and theistic belief. In Expelled, he criticizes other Darwinists for their lack of sincerity and honesty: “There’s a kind of science defense lobby or an evolution defense lobby, in particular. They are mostly atheists, but they are wanting to—desperately wanting—to be friendly to mainstream, sensible religious people. And the way you do that is to tell them that there’s no incompatibility between science and religion….If they called me as a witness, and a lawyer said, ‘Dr. Dawkins, has your belief in evolution, has your study of evolution turned you toward [atheism]?’ I would have to say yes. And that is the worst possible thing I could say for winning you that court case. So people like me are bad news for...the science lobby, the evolution lobby.”
Dawkins’ next book will be The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution, appearing at the end of September 2009.

Richard Dawkins (born 1941)'Richard Dawkins is quite simply incomparable. No one can make science so exciting, so interesting, or so clear....If only Stephen Hawking had a tenth of his clarity.' Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy, The SpectatorEarly LifeRichard Dawkins was born in Nairobi, Kenya in 1941. His father, by profession a agricultural civil servant in British colonial Africa, had joined the King’s African Rifles during the Second World War. Dawkins spent the first part of his childhood in Nyasaland, then a British colony and now called Malawi. Aged eight his family returned to England where his father inherited a country estate near Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. His father converted the estate into a commercial farm and home for the family. Dawkins’ upbringing was typically Anglican, he was confirmed and believed in God until his mid-teens when, having read about Darwin’s theory of evolution, he realised that it offered a “superior explanation” for the existence of life. This discovery was to mark his life incalculably, becoming the focus of his scientific career.Having attended Oundle School Dawkins studied Zoology at Balliol College, Oxford where he was tutored by Nikolaas Tinbergen. He graduated with a second-class degree in 1962. Continuing his studies he worked towards both an MA and D.Phil, focusing on the study of animal decision making.  Whilst at Oxford  he met Marian Stamp, an expert in animal behaviour who would become one of the leading world experts on animal welfare. They married in 1967.Between 1967 and 1969 he was an assistant professor at Berkley, California where he continued his research in evolutionary biology, whilst at the same time becoming involved in the anti-Vietnam protest movement. He returned to Oxford University in 1970 to become a lecturer and work on a book based on his years of research. The successor to Darwin The first book by Richard Dawkins was published in 1976 and was titled The Selfish Gene, something he had been working on for a number of years. The book would become one of the most important scientific texts of the 20th century, causing a revolution in the understanding of evolution. The book proposed that the primary engine for evolution was genetic, the genes themselves persuade organisms to evolve, not, as was previously assumed, group behaviour. The success of the book lead to Dawkins being heralded in the media as the successor to Darwin. The book’s success even went so far as to coin a new phrase to the English language – ‘meme’ (meaning a unit of cultural evolution, analogous to biological evolution).With his new found celebrity and status Dawkins was able to become the world’s leading exponent of the theory of evolution. Books by Richard Dawkins and his stature as a renowned academic and passionate atheist have often led to controversy and criticism from religious leaders. His book The Blind Watchmaker (1986) expanded on his theory of gene-centred evolution whilst rationally examining the arguments for the ‘intelligent design’ theory of creation and caused considerable controversy on its release.  The God DelusionHaving witnessed the 11th September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, Dawkins came to the conclusion that religion was not  'harmless nonsense, [but] it can be lethally dangerous nonsense' and decided to write a book that would challenge all arguments for religious faith, not merely those related to evolutionary biology. The most controversial of all the books by Richard Dawkins,The God Delusion, was published in 2006, and catapulted him to even greater fame as the figurehead for international atheism. The book collected together the arguments for a higher power and attacked each one rationally. It champions the message that atheists and society in general can be happy, balanced and moral without the need for belief in a higher power. It caused enormous controversy, suggesting that religion is not only false belief but a malevolent force. Since publication it has sold over 1.5 million copies. The book was dedicated to the late Douglas Adams, Dawkins’ friend. The preface includes Adams' quote 'Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?'. Adams was also responsible for introducing Dawkins to his third wife Lalla Ward, an actress known for appearing in Doctor Who, a popular TV programme which Adams wrote for.  They have been together since 1994. Now semi-retired, Dawkins recently published a book explaining secular arguments to children and young adults – The Magic of Reality: How We Know What’s Really True.

=======================================================
Oxford professor Richard Dawkins has helped steer evolutionary science into the 21st century, and his concept of the "meme" contextualized the spread of ideas in the information age. In recent years, his devastating critique of religion has made him a leading figure in the New Atheism.
As an evolutionary biologist, Richard Dawkins has broadened our understanding of the genetic origin of our species; as a popular author, he has helped lay readers understand complex scientific concepts. He's best-known for the ideas laid out in his landmark book The Selfish Gene  and fleshed out in The Extended Phenotype: the rather radical notion that Darwinian selection happens not at the level of the individual, but at the level of our DNA. The implication: We evolved for only one purpose — to serve our genes.Of perhaps equal importance is Dawkins' concept of the meme, which he defines as a self-replicating unit of culture -- an idea, a chain letter, a catchy tune, an urban legend -- which is passed person-to-person, its longevity based on its ability to lodge in the brain and inspire transmission to others. Introduced in The Selfish Gene in 1976, the concept of memes has itself proven highly contagious, inspiring countless accounts and explanations of idea propagation in the information age.In recent years, Dawkins has become outspoken in his atheism, coining the word "bright" (as an alternate to atheist), and encouraging fellow non-believers to stand up and be identified. His controversial, confrontational 2002 TED talk was a seminal moment for the New Atheism, as was the publication of his 2006 book, The God Delusion, a bestselling critique of religion that championed atheism and promoted scientific principles over creationism and intelligent design.
"Dawkins ... is a master of scientific exposition and synthesis. When it comes to his own specialty, evolutionary biology, there is none better." —
If living in Richard Dawkins’ world is to live without an omnipotent creator, to explain life’s most wondrous mysteries with scientific fact, is it also to live in a world devoid of beauty and magic? No, says Dawkins, in his newest book, The Magic of Reality: How We Know What’s Really True, which makes its […]
Via Boing Boing via The First Post, we learn that Richard Dawkins‘ foundation is funding a summer camp to teach children reason, skepticism and science. From the article: Alongside the more traditional activities of tug-of-war, swimming and canoeing, children at the five-day camp in Somerset will learn about rational scepticism, moral philosophy, ethics and evolution.

Updated 10/29/08: Oxford announced yesterday the appointment of Professor Marcus du Sautoy to the Charles Simonyi Chair for the Public Understanding of Science. Du Sautoy is a mathematician and a dedicated popularizer of math and science. To get to know him, you might start with today’s installment of his London Times column “Sexy Maths.” From […]
The history of science has been one long series of violent brainstorms, as successive generations have come to terms with increasing levels of queerness in the universe.
Our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude of size and speed which our bodies operate at. We never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms.

                            Memoro is an international non-profit project, an open archive of audio or video interviews of people born before 1950.
                    You can easily contribute: a camera, a smartphone, a webcam or an audio-recorder is enough. 
                            If you are an Association, a Museum or an Archive, share your contents with more 
                            We need your help to improve the project, to collect more memories and preserve them for the future, to develop Memoro projects in new Countries, to keep the site free from advertising.
