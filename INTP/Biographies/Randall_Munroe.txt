Randall Patrick Munroe (born October 17, 1984)[1][2] is an American webcomic author, former NASA roboticist,[3][4] and the creator of the webcomic xkcd. He and the webcomic have developed a cult following, and after leaving NASA he became a professional webcomic artist.[5] In 2013, a main-belt asteroid (4942 Munroe) was named after him.[6]
This article's factual accuracy is disputed. Please help to ensure that disputed statements are reliably sourced. See the relevant discussion on the talk page. (February 2014)
Munroe was raised as a Quaker,[7][non-primary source needed] and was a fan of the funny pages from an early age,[5] starting off with Calvin and Hobbes.[8] After graduating from the Chesterfield County Mathematics and Science High School at Clover Hill: A Renaissance Program, he graduated from Christopher Newport University in 2006 with a degree in physics.[9][10] Munroe worked as an Independent contracting roboticist for NASA at the Langley Research Center[11] before and after his graduation. In October 2006 NASA did not renew his contract[12] and he began to write xkcd full-time. He now supports himself by the sale of xkcd related merchandise.[5][13] The webcomic quickly became very popular, garnering up to 70 million hits a month by October 2007.[14]
He has also toured the lecture circuit, giving speeches at such places as Google's Googleplex in Mountain View, California.[15]
Munroe announced in June 2011 that his fiancée had been diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer,[16] and in September that they had married.[17]
In September 2013, Munroe announced that a group of xkcd readers had submitted his name as a candidate for the renaming of asteroid (4942) 1987 DU6 to 4942 Munroe which was accepted by the International Astronomical Union.[18][19][20]
xkcd is a stick figure comic with themes in computer science, technology, mathematics, science, philosophy, language, pop culture and romance.
Munroe had originally used xkcd as an instant messaging screenname because he wanted a name without a meaning so he wouldn't eventually grow tired of it.[13] He registered the domain name, but left it idle until he started posting his drawings[13] in September 2005.[21] The comic has a very loyal fanbase. Munroe said, "I think the comic that's gotten me the most feedback is actually the one about the stoplights".[14][22]
Munroe licenses his xkcd creations under the Creative Commons attribution-noncommercial 2.5, stating that it isn't just about the free culture movement, but that it also makes good business sense.[13] His income derives from the sale of merchandise to his fans, sales consisting of thousands of t-shirts a month.[5]
The popularity of the strip among science fiction fans resulted in Munroe being nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist in 2011 and again in 2012.[23] In 2014 he was nominated in the Best Graphic Story category, for Time.[24]
Munroe is the creator of the now defunct websites "The Funniest",[25] "The Cutest",[26] and "The Fairest",[27] each of which presents the user with two options and asks them to choose one over the other.
He started the "WetRiffs" website as a joke, one month after drawing the "Rule 34" comic,[28] "lamenting the lack of guitar-in-the-shower pictures on the internet."[29]
LimerickDB encouraged the creation of new and the collection of old limericks,[30] but is no longer accessible.
He started a Geohashing wiki based on one of his comics which contains an algorithm that generates pseudo-random coordinates around the world every day.[31]
He has also started a project called "What if?" where users post questions to the website which are usually absurd and physics/math related, and he answers them using his own knowledge as well as various sources from the web.[32]
Aside from maintaining his websites, Munroe also engages in kite photography, in which cameras are attached to kites and pictures are then taken of the ground or buildings.[33]
In response to concerns about the radiation released by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, and to remedy what he described as "confusing" reporting on radiation levels in the media, Munroe created a chart of comparative radiation exposure levels. The chart was rapidly adopted by print and online journalists in several countries, including being linked to by online writers for The Guardian[34] and The New York Times.[35] As a result of requests for permission to reprint the chart and to translate it into Japanese, Munroe placed it in the public domain, but requested that his non-expert status should be clearly stated in any reprinting.[36]
Munroe published an xkcd-style comic on scientific publishing and open access in Science in October 2013.[37]

=======================================================
xkcd, sometimes stylized as XKCD, is a webcomic created by Randall Munroe. The comic's tagline describes it as "a webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language."[‡ 1] Munroe mentions on the comic's website that the name of the comic is not an acronym but "just a word with no phonetic pronunciation".
The subject matter of the comic varies from statements on life and love to mathematical and scientific in-jokes. Some strips feature simple humor or pop-culture references. Although it has a cast of stick figures,[2][3] the comic occasionally features landscapes, intricate mathematical patterns such as fractals (for example, strip No. 17 "What If"[‡ 2] shows an Apollonian gasket), intricate graphs and charts, or imitations of the style of other cartoonists (as during "Parody Week").[4]
xkcd is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.5 License.[‡ 3] New comics are added three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,[‡ 1][5] although on some occasions they have been updated every weekday.
Since July 2012, there has been a branch of xkcd called xkcd What-If, updated every Tuesday. These attempt to answer unusual reader-submitted science questions in a humorous—though mathematically sound—way, in a format more like an article rather than a traditional comic strip.[6][7]
The comic began in September 2005 when Munroe decided to scan doodles from his school notebooks and put them on his webpage. Eventually the comic was split off into its own website, where Munroe started selling T-shirts based on the comic. He currently "works on the comic full-time,"[‡ 1] making Munroe one of the few professional webcomic artists.[8]
According to Munroe, the comic's name has no particular significance and is simply a four-letter word without a phonetic pronunciation, something he describes as "a treasured and carefully guarded point in the space of four-character strings." The name of the comic is spelled in all lowercase letters, or all capitals.[‡ 1]
In May 2007, the comic garnered widespread attention by depicting online communities in geographic form.[9] Various websites were drawn as continents, each sized according to their relative popularity and located according to their general subject matter.[9] This put xkcd at number two on the Syracuse Post-Standard's "The new hotness" list.[10]
In October 2008, The New Yorker magazine online published an interview and "Cartoon Off" between Randall Munroe and Farley Katz. For the "Cartoon-Off", Katz and Munroe each drew: "the Internet, as envisioned by the elderly", "String Theory", "1999", and "your favorite animal eating your favorite food".[11]
In March 2010, a puzzle hidden inside of the collection xkcd: Volume 0 was cracked by many members of the xkcd forums. The solution was "<3<3<3 2010-06-26 14:28:57 37°46′10″N 122°28′59″W﻿ / ﻿37.769573°N 122.483123°W﻿ / 37.769573; -122.483123"—ASCII art hearts, followed by the timestamp for June 26, 2010, 2:28:57 pm, and the coordinates Google Earth specifies for Golden Gate Park."[‡ 4] At the specified time, date, and location, Munroe met with fans and handed out 255 limited edition prints of xkcd: Volume 0, titled xkcd: Volume 0 Service Pack 1.[‡ 5]
For April Fools Day 2012, comic № 1037 ("Umwelt") displayed different comics depending on browser, location, and IP address range.[‡ 6][‡ 7]
On September 19, 2012, comic № 1110 ("Click and Drag"), featured a panel which can be explored via clicking and dragging its insides.[‡ 8] It immediately triggered positive response on social websites and forums.[12] The large image measures 165,888 pixels wide by 79,822 pixels high.[13]
Comic number 1190 ("Time") began publication at midnight EDT on March 25, 2013, with the comic's image updating every 30 minutes until March 30, when they began to change every hour, lasting for over four months. The images constitute time lapse frames of a story, with the mouseover text originally reading "Wait for it.", later changed "RUN." and changed again to "The end." on July 26. The story began with a male and female character building a sandcastle complex on a beach who then embark on an adventure to learn the secrets of the sea. On July 26, the comic superimposed a frame (3094) with the phrase "The End". Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club wrote of the comic: "[...] the kind of nifty experiment that keeps people coming back to XKCD, which at its best isn't a strip comic so much as an idea factory and a shared experience".[14] Cory Doctorow mentioned "Time" in a brief article on Boing Boing on April 7, saying the comic was "coming along nicely". The 3,099-panel "Time" comic ended on July 26, 2013 and the "secret" backstory has now been revealed.[15]
For April Fools Day 2013, comic № 1193 ("Externalities") changed its text content over that day, depending on various external values, from the amount of money donated to the Wikimedia Foundation via a link in the comic, to the school of first- and third-place winners of an xkcd hash-finding competition at http://almamater.xkcd.com/.[16]
While there is no specific storyline to the comic, there are some recurring themes and characters,[17] many of which are touched on in an xkcd parody of the Discovery Channel's I Love the World advertising campaign,[‡ 9] which was later reenacted by Neil Gaiman, Wil Wheaton, and Cory Doctorow,[18] directed and recorded by musician Olga Nunes.
A large number of the strips contain mathematics or computer science jokes. These jokes often feature university-level subjects, although many are written in such a way that a clear understanding of the subject is not required to get the punch line.
Romance is another subject often visited in the comic, with many strips not intended to be humorous;[17] Munroe is a self-declared fan of artist Kurt Halsey's bleak romances. There are also many strips opening with "My Hobby:" and usually depicting the nondescript narrator character describing some type of humorous or quirky behavior often involving language games.[‡ 10][‡ 11][‡ 12][‡ 13]
"Malamanteau",[‡ 14] with mouseover text "The article has twenty-three citations, one of which is an obscure manuscript from the 1490s and the other twenty-two are arguments on Language Log."
References to Wikipedia articles or to Wikipedia as a whole have occurred several times in xkcd.[‡ 14][‡ 15][‡ 16][‡ 17][‡ 18][‡ 19][‡ 20] A facsimile of a made-up Wikipedia entry for "malamanteau" (a stunt word created by Munroe to poke fun at Wikipedia's writing style)[‡ 14] provoked a controversy within Wikipedia that was picked up by various media.[19][20]
xkcd frequently makes reference to Munroe's "obsession" with potential raptor attacks,[21] and has used many "your mom" jokes.[‡ 21][‡ 22][‡ 23][‡ 24] Multiple earlier strips featured "Red Spiders",[‡ 25][‡ 26][‡ 27][‡ 28] and others refer to Joss Whedon's science fiction series Firefly.[‡ 29] Munroe at one point drew several strips addressing his fiancee's ongoing treatment for breast cancer.[‡ 30]
Each comic has a tooltip (specified using the title attribute in HTML). The text usually contains a secondary punchline or annotation related to that day's comic.[22]
Although Munroe does not maintain a list of characters on his web site, some recurring characters can be identified by their visual features (for example, hats) and mannerisms.
Black Hat, or Black Hat Guy, a man who looks like a normal stick-figure xkcd character, but for the addition of a black hat, a reference to Aram from the now-defunct webcomic Men in Hats, not to black hat hackers as is often supposed.[23][‡ 31] This character first appeared in the comic "Poisson" (the twelfth comic published on the website).[‡ 32] The character refers to himself as a "Classhole" (a portmanteau of "classy" and "asshole").[‡ 33] He does not shy from pointing out the failures of others and has at times used extreme violence in order to emphasize a point.[‡ 34][‡ 35] In the January 30, 2008 comic, his hat was taken by a woman, though he later retrieved it by stealing a submarine and using it to crash through the ice where she was skating. The character is one of the most frequently occurring in the comic, though he remains unnamed (he was referred to in multiple comics as "hat guy").[‡ 31][‡ 36]
In the "Secretary" story arc, Black Hat is nominated for the post of Secretary of the Internet when the Internet starts to collapse. After a variety of hijinks involving Ron Paul, Cory Doctorow, and the Auto-Troll Shuffle (described by him as taking a whole car apart, swapping the parts with the same parts of random cars in the same parking lot, and then building a new car out of them), he is sentenced to death. He escapes by filling the Capitol rotunda with plastic ball pit-style balls, distracting his pursuers while he flees on Doctorow's hot-air balloon.[‡ 37] Since comic 433 "Journal 5" he has been in a relationship with "psychotic female". His apartment is outfitted with a moat.[‡ 38]
A recurring female character, known as Megan. She is first referred to by name in comic № 159 – "Boombox",[‡ 39] and again several times afterward,[‡ 40][‡ 41][‡ 42] although she may have appeared earlier as an unnamed character notably in comic № 108 - "M.C. Hammer Slide".[‡ 43] She is recognized by her short, dark hair.
A beret-wearing male existentialist and eccentric. He is first seen in the "Nihilism" comic,[‡ 44] and often has odd behaviors, ideas and activities underway.
Psychotic female, distinguished by long dark hair, a general proximity to Black Hat Guy and a tendency towards excessive violence, both verbal and physical. Her first appearance is in comic 377, "Journal 2".[‡ 45] She has been a recurring character since then, in some form of relationship with the equally psychotic Black Hat Guy, causing chaos, damage, vandalism and abuse with no apparent remorse or reason.
A similar character appeared earlier in comic 177, "Alice and Bob", where she is referred to as "Eve".[‡ 46]
A boy in a barrel appeared in five early strips. Unlike most other characters, he is not a stick figure.[‡ 47] He was repeatedly seen inside a barrel, floating in a large body of water. The boy in the barrel was one of many doodles in the older comics, but has not been seen since comic № 31, in which he flew away with a ferret wearing a toy airplane.[‡ 48]
A pet ferret with wings similar to a plane's on its back with the rudders of a plane's tail on its tail appeared in comics including Barrel – Part 5[‡ 48] and a guest comic.[‡ 49]
Fictionalized versions of well known real-life figures in the computing and scientific community sometimes appear, such as free software advocates Richard Stallman[‡ 50][‡ 51] and Cory Doctorow,[‡ 51][‡ 52] and physicist Richard Feynman.[‡ 53][‡ 54]
Mrs. Roberts was a main character in the "1337"[‡ 56] series, and has appeared in other comics along with her children, Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;-- aka "Little Bobby Tables" (a reference to SQL injection), and Elaine Roberts (although her first name is really "Help I'm trapped in a drivers license factory"), the protagonist of the "1337" series.[‡ 57][‡ 58][improper synthesis?]
Firefly character River Tam—and actress Summer Glau, who played her—has appeared in a few comics, usually in a dream sequence where a character in the strip makes reference to her.[‡ 59] Other Firefly cast members, such as Nathan Fillion, have appeared in the series;[‡ 29] many turn out to have similar personalities to their Firefly characters.
On several occasions, fans have been motivated by Munroe's comics to carry out, in real life, the subject of a particular drawing or sketch. Some examples include:
Richard Stallman was sent a katana[‡ 60] and was confronted by students dressed as ninjas before speaking at the Yale Political Union[24][25]—inspired by "Open Source".[‡ 50]
On September 23, 2007, hundreds of people gathered at Reverend Thomas J. Williams Park, 42°23′44″N 71°07′50″W﻿ / ﻿42.39561°N 71.13051°W﻿ / 42.39561; -71.13051, in North Cambridge, Massachusetts, whose coordinates were mentioned in "Dream Girl".[‡ 61] Munroe appeared, commenting, "Maybe wanting something does make it real," reversing the conclusion he drew in the last frame of the same strip.[26]
When Cory Doctorow won the 2007 EFF Pioneer Award, the presenters gave him a red cape, goggles and a balloon[‡ 62] – inspired by "Blagofaire".[‡ 52]
xkcd readers began sneaking chess boards onto roller coasters after "Chess Photo" was published.[27][‡ 63] – inspired by "Chess Photo".[‡ 64]
The game of "geohashing"[‡ 65] has gained more than 1,000 players,[‡ 66] who travel to random coordinates calculated by the algorithm described in "Geohashing".[‡ 67]
In October 2007, a group of researchers at University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute conducted a census of the Internet and presented their data using a Hilbert curve, which they claimed was inspired by an xkcd comic that used a similar technique.[28][29][‡ 68] Inspired by the same comic, the Carna Botnet used a Hilbert curve to present data in their 2012 Internet Census.[30]
YouTube has placed a feature on comments that plays back the comment aloud on "Audio Preview", possibly based on the strip "Listen to Yourself".[‡ 69][31][32]
Running the following code is an easter egg in Python 2.7 and on: import antigravity, inspired by the strip "Python".[‡ 70][33] The module also contains a geohashing function.
In the xkcd cartoon "Troll Slayer",[‡ 71] 4chan's /b/ boards are taken over by Twilight lovers. In response to this, /b/ was temporarily renamed "Twilight Appreciation Station", and included the text "We have met the enemy and he is us", which appears in the cartoon as a note added by Randall Munroe. In order to prevent /b/ from trolling the xkcd forums, registration was blocked for several days after the comic appeared.
In November 2010, in response to the comic "Malamanteau", several Wikipedia editors attempted to create a Wikipedia article of the same name, which led to a large debate about what does and doesn't belong in the encyclopedia.[34]
Drupal's command-line utility Drush has a make-me-a-sandwich command, which requires sudo access, just like in "Sandwich".[‡ 73][36]
RepRap/Makerbot operator Allan Ecker was inspired by xkcd "Infrastructures"[‡ 74] to actually design a tiny open source violin, available on Thingiverse.[37]
Based on "Packages",[‡ 75] programmers set up programs to automatically find an item for sale on the Internet for $1.00 every day.[38][39]
AAISP has implemented the code word "shibboleet" in their call centers in reference to "Tech Support".[‡ 76][40][non-primary source needed]
"Rule 34",[‡ 77] has the characters commenting on the lack of pornography featuring women in the shower playing electric guitar. Randall Munroe subsequently created the website WetRiffs.com, which hosts submitted pictures of men and women in showers playing guitars.[‡ 78]
In response to "Password Strength",[‡ 79] Dropbox shows two messages reading "lol" and "Whoa there, don't take advice from a webcomic too literally ;)" when attempting to register with the password "correcthorsebatterystaple".[41] ArenaNet recommended that Guild Wars 2 users create passwords following the guidelines of the same comic.[42]
Following "Approximations",[‡ 80] the equation for white house switchboard constant described in the comic was added to WolframAlpha database.[43]
xkcd has been recognized at the Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards. In the 2008 Awards, it was nominated for "Outstanding Use of the Medium", "Outstanding Short Form Comic", and "Outstanding Comedic Comic", and won "Outstanding Single Panel Comic".[45] xkcd was also voted Best Comic Strip by readers in the 2007 Weblog Awards[46] and 2008 Weblog Awards.[47] It was also nominated for a 2009 NewNowNext Award in the category 'OMFG Internet Award'.[48][49] Randall Munroe was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist in both 2011 and 2012,[50][51] as well as for Best Graphic Story in 2014, for "Time".[52]
xkcd comics have been translated into a number of languages. One group of readers has translated every comic into French[‡ 81] and nearly half of the comics have been translated into Russian.[‡ 82] One reader has translated many of the comics into Spanish; translations exist for comics that, according to the translator, can be translated without losing their humor.[‡ 83] Various xkcd comics have also been translated into German,[‡ 84] Finnish,[‡ 85] Czech,[‡ 86] Portuguese,[‡ 87] Esperanto,[‡ 88] Lojban,[‡ 89] and Yiddish.[‡ 90]
In September 2009, Munroe released a book, entitled xkcd: volume 0, containing selected xkcd comics.[‡ 91] The book was published by breadpig, under a Creative Commons license, CC BY-NC 3.0,[53] with all of the publisher's profits donated to Room to Read to promote literacy and education in the developing world. Six months after release, the book had sold over 25,000 copies. The book tour in New York City and Silicon Valley was a fundraiser for Room to Read that raised $32,000 to build a school in Salavan Province, Laos.[54][55]
In October 2012, xkcd: volume 0 was included in the Humble Bundle eBook Bundle. It was available for download only to those who donated higher than the average donated for the other eBooks. The book was released DRM-free, in two different-quality PDF files.[56]
On March 12, 2014, Randall Munroe announced the book ″What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions″. The book's release date is September 2, 2014. The book expands on the What-If series on the website.[57][58]

Note: You are welcome to reprint occasional comics pretty much anywhere (presentations, papers, blogs with ads, etc).  If you're not outright merchandizing, you're probably fine.  Just be sure to attribute the comic to xkcd.com.
If you have a question or comment about xkcd, you may want to try sharing it on the forums or the IRC channel.
I'm just this guy, you know?  I'm a CNU graduate with a degree in physics.  Before starting xkcd, I worked on robots at NASA's Langley Research Center in Virginia.  As of June 2007 I live in Massachusetts.  In my spare time I climb things, open strange doors, and go to goth clubs dressed as a frat guy so I can stand around and look terribly uncomfortable.  At frat parties I do the same thing, but the other way around.
Occasionally produce a few extra comics such as a pair of comics for IBM's A Smarter Planet initiative (also archived here as they are released).
Server maintenance and most of the coding for these sites is done by my friend davean, who tries hard to remain invisible but can be reached at davean@xkcd.com.
It's not actually an acronym.  It's just a word with no phonetic pronunciation -- a treasured and carefully-guarded point in the space of four-character strings.
I was going through old math/sketching graph paper notebooks and didn't want to lose some of the work in them, so I started scanning pages.  I took the more comic-y ones and put them up on a server I was testing out, and got a bunch of readers when BoingBoing linked to me.  I started drawing more seriously, gained a lot more readers, started selling t-shirts on the site, and am currently shipping t-shirts and drawing this comic full-time.  It's immensely fun and I really appreciate y'all's support.
They can be read with extensions like Long Titles, or by right-clicking on the images and going to 'properties', then clicking and dragging to read the whole thing.
Note: It looks like it's been fixed in Firefox 3.0.  Now, as an added tweak, to keep the tooltips from expiring while you're reading, you can use this.
If it's a not-for-profit publication, you need no permission -- just print them with attribution to xkcd.com.  If it's a for-profit operation, I will probably give you permission if you email me to let me know.
I frequently lurk on irc.foonetic.net as 'Randall' -- if you leave a message for me there I will probably get it.  If you have a general question about xkcd, you may also want to try the fora.
Note: I don't use submitted comic ideas and I have already heard about every company making human hamster balls and any news story about velociraptors.
Yes.  You can get comics through the JSON interface, at URLs like http://xkcd.com/info.0.json (current comic) and http://xkcd.com/614/info.0.json (comic #614).
Translating humor is often difficult between groups that speak the same language, let alone totally different cultures.  So it's inherently a hard problem.  However, a reader does translate xkcd strips into Spanish, which can be found at es.xkcd.com.
For those of us pedantic enough to want a rule, here it is:  The preferred form is "xkcd", all lower-case.  In formal contexts where a lowercase word shouldn't start a sentence, "XKCD" is an okay alternative.  "Xkcd" is frowned upon.
This is tricky.  Most of what they teach you in school is just as an example of how to think about algorithms; 99% of the time you shouldn't worry about optimizing your sorts.  Just learn to implement Quicksort (which is very good) and use that without fretting about it too much.  People overfocus on efficiency over clarity and simplicity.  And most of the time the environment you're coding in will have an efficient sort function built-in anyway.
Note: If you're interviewing for a company for a position with a focus on algorithms, the above is not an excuse not to know your stuff.

The keynotes by Randall Munroe are always highly entertaining, thanks to the comic's deadpan sense of humor. The CNU graduate studied physics before working as a roboticist at NASA's Langley Research Center in Virginia.
Beyond his passion for math and science, Munroe is a talented web cartoonist. He began the arbitrarily named webcomic 'xkcd,' which garners millions of views per month. In 2007, Wired described xkcd, writing, "the comic is itself a language -- a way for people who are unpracticed at talking about their emotions to articulate them."
Munroe also runs a blog, titled 'What If?,' which specializes in answering hypothetical "what if?" questions submitted by users. He enjoys musing over these fanciful hypotheticals, considering it a bonus if he can "put boxes around it and make it a comic."
Randall Munroe doesn’t like math for the sake of doing math, a revelation he makes during his creative curiosity talk. Rather, he likes math because it’s a process that allows you to use...

The PyCon organizers committee would like to confirm that Randall Munroe of xkcd is, in fact, banned from PyCon 2009.  We apologize to all 2008 attendees for last year's disgraceful keynote, "Web Spiders vs. Red Spiders".  PyCon is a serious conference and we will not countenance this sort of nonsensical frivolity.  Many of our sponsors feel that Mr. Munroe is the single largest cause of programmer distraction and his presence would be inappropriate.Registration volunteers have been instructed to refuse admission to Randall Munroe personally, and in fact, to any stick figures who may attempt to register, particularly if they are wearing hats.  If Mr. Munroe happens to defeat our elaborate security protocols and attend nonetheless, we urge attendees to avoid any Open Spaces he may convene.
Yeah, I work at SIGGRAPH every year and we had to escort him out last year because he kept doodling stick figures on all the signage! ;)
I have to wonder why you gave a comic artist and casual python programmer the keynote. I can't help but laugh.But yes, even as an xkcd fan I can see why you don't want him back. From what I've publicly seen of Randall he rarely takes things seriously.
From __joke-responses__ import whoosh(unless anonymous above is Mr. Munroe himslef, which I half-suspect)
I will be attending PyCon 2009 in a Randall Munroe costume, as stick figure costumes are difficult to fit into.
Brilliant!  :DI got here from the forum's posts of the original joke, and it made me laugh a lot! This great sense of humor is one of the things I love of python community. +1 for you, guys!
As a professional Spiderologist, I have to disagree with you. Dr. Munroe's speeches are elegant and to-the-point. His oratory is as simple yet powerful as Python itself, and could in fact be called "executable pseudocode".
I can't quite tell if this post is serious...  Hopefully this is a joke.  Randall is brilliant.  Many people that I know in the Python community love his work.  PyCon would surely be better with Randall's comic relief.  Lighten up.
Ras -  to put your mind at ease:....It's a ... Oh, no!  I'm being escorted out!!!!WAAAAAIIIIIT!!!!!BUT I AM NOT!  NOT! NNNOOOOTTT A STICK FIGURE!!!!
If you lot can't behave I'm going to have to send you all to bed without any tea. Good heavens, you meet with the Board for one hour and all hell breaks loose ...
To Ras Samual...O.oIf you believe for a second that this is serious, then perhaps I should suggest you take your own advice and lighten up.
RasSomeone is _wrong_ on the Internet, and *you* can't go to bed until that condition is rectified. This is an extremely serious matter. Let us know how it works out for you.Hint, hint.
For every organization, there is a foil / lampoon. Show me a group that cannot incorporate that into their own workings, and I'll show you an entire conference taking themselves entirely too seriously.
There are legitimate reasons to ban Randall,( but we all know that those are mundane compared to what he can contribute:))
