=======================================================
Jimmy Donal "Jimbo" Wales (/ˈdʒɪmi ˈdoʊnəl ˈweɪlz/; born August 7, 1966[2]) is an American Internet entrepreneur best known as the co-founder and promoter of the online non-profit encyclopedia Wikipedia and the for-profit Wikia web-hosting company.[3][4] Wales was born in Huntsville, Alabama, where he attended Randolph School, a university-preparatory school, earning bachelor's and master's degrees in finance.
While in graduate school, he taught at two universities, but left before completing a PhD in order to take a job in finance and later worked as the research director of a Chicago futures and options firm. In 1996, he and two partners founded Bomis, a male-oriented web portal featuring entertainment and adult content. The company would provide the initial funding for the peer-reviewed free encyclopedia Nupedia (2000–03) and its successor, Wikipedia.
On January 15, 2001, with Larry Sanger and others, Wales launched Wikipedia, a free, open content encyclopedia that enjoyed rapid growth and popularity, and as Wikipedia's public profile grew, he became the project's promoter and spokesman. He is historically cited as a co-founder of Wikipedia, though he has disputed the "co-" designation, declaring himself the sole founder.[5][6]
Wales serves on the board of trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit charitable organization he helped establish to operate Wikipedia, holding its board-appointed "community founder" seat. In 2004 he co-founded Wikia, a for-profit wiki-hosting service. His role in creating Wikipedia, which has become the world's largest encyclopedia, prompted Time magazine to name him in its 2006 list of "The 100 Most Influential People in the World".[7]
Wales was born in Huntsville, Alabama, on August 7, 1966.[2][8] His father, Jimmy,[9] worked as a grocery store manager, while his mother, Doris, and his grandmother, Erma, ran the House of Learning,[10] a small private school in the tradition of the one-room schoolhouse, where Wales and his three siblings received their early education.[10][11] As a child, Wales was a keen reader with an acute intellectual curiosity.[4]
During an interview in 2005 with Brian Lamb, Wales described his childhood private school as a "Montessori influenced philosophy of education," where he "spent lots of hours poring over the Britannicas and World Book Encyclopedias".[12] There were only four other children in Wales' grade, so the school grouped together the first through fourth grade students and the fifth through eighth grade students. As an adult, Wales was sharply critical of the government's treatment of the school, citing the "constant interference and bureaucracy and very sort of snobby inspectors from the state" as a formative influence on his political philosophy.[12]
After eighth grade, Wales attended Randolph School,[13] a university-preparatory school in Huntsville, graduating at sixteen.[14] Wales said that the school was expensive for his family, but that "education was always a passion in my household... you know, the very traditional approach to knowledge and learning and establishing that as a base for a good life."[12] He received his bachelor's degree in finance from Auburn University in 1986.[15] Wales then entered the PhD finance program at the University of Alabama before leaving with a master's degree to enter the PhD finance program at Indiana University.[11][12][14] He taught at both universities during his postgraduate studies but did not write the doctoral dissertation required for a PhD, something he ascribed to boredom.[11][12]

In 1994, Wales took a job with Chicago Options Associates, a futures and options trading firm in Chicago, Illinois.[12][16][17] Wales has described himself as having been addicted to the Internet from an early stage and he wrote computer code during his leisure time. During his studies in Alabama, he had become an obsessive player of Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs)—a type of virtual role-playing game—and thereby experienced the potential of computer networks to foster large-scale collaborative projects.[14][18]
Inspired by the remarkable initial public offering of Netscape in 1995, and having accumulated capital through "speculating on interest-rate and foreign-currency fluctuations",[10] Wales decided to leave the realm of financial trading and became an Internet entrepreneur.[14] In 1996, he and two partners founded Bomis,[10][19] a web portal featuring user-generated webrings and, for a time, erotic photographs.[20] Wales described it as a "guy-oriented search engine" with a market similar to that of Maxim magazine;[11][12][21] the Bomis venture did not ultimately turn out to be successful.[10][11][22]
Though Bomis had struggled to make money, it provided Wales with the funding to pursue his greater passion, an online encyclopedia.[11] While moderating an online discussion group devoted to the philosophy of Objectivism in the early 1990s, Wales had encountered Larry Sanger, a skeptic of the philosophy.[4] The two had engaged in detailed debate on the subject on Wales' list and then on Sanger's, eventually meeting offline to continue the debate and becoming friends.[4] Years later, after deciding to pursue his encyclopedia project and seeking a credentialed academic to lead it,[18] Wales hired Sanger – who at that time was a doctoral student in philosophy at Ohio State University – to be its editor-in-chief, and in March 2000, Nupedia ("the free encyclopedia"), a peer-reviewed, open-content encyclopedia, was launched.[11][12] The intent behind Nupedia was to have expert-written entries on a variety of topics, and to sell advertising alongside the entries in order to make profit.[4] The project was characterized by an extensive peer-review process designed to make its articles of a quality comparable to that of professional encyclopedias.[23]
The idea was to have thousands of volunteers writing articles for an online encyclopedia in all languages. Initially we found ourselves organizing the work in a very top-down, structured, academic, old-fashioned way. It was no fun for the volunteer writers because we had a lot of academic peer review committees who would criticize articles and give feedback. It was like handing in an essay at grad school, and basically intimidating to participate in.
In an October 2009 speech, Wales recollects attempting to write a Nupedia article on Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert C. Merton, but being too intimidated to submit his first draft to the prestigious finance professors who were to peer review it, even though he had published a paper on Option Pricing Theory and was comfortable with the subject matter. Wales characterized this as the moment he realized that the Nupedia model was not going to work.[25]
In January 2001, Sanger was introduced to the concept of a wiki by extreme programming enthusiast Ben Kovitz after explaining to Kovitz the slow pace of growth Nupedia endured as a result of its onerous submission process.[26] Kovitz suggested that adopting the wiki model would allow editors to contribute simultaneously and incrementally throughout the project, thus breaking Nupedia's bottleneck.[26] Sanger was excited about the idea, and after he proposed it to Wales, they created the first Nupedia wiki on January 10, 2001.[26] The wiki was initially intended as a collaborative project for the public to write articles that would then be reviewed for publication by Nupedia's expert volunteers. The majority of Nupedia's experts, however, wanted nothing to do with this project, fearing that mixing amateur content with professionally researched and edited material would compromise the integrity of Nupedia's information and damage the credibility of the encyclopedia.[27] Thus, the wiki project, dubbed "Wikipedia" by Sanger,[5] went live at a separate domain five days after its creation.[17][22]
Originally, Bomis planned to make Wikipedia a profitable business.[28] While Sanger saw Wikipedia primarily as a tool to aid Nupedia development, Wales felt that Wikipedia might have the potential to become the truly collaborative, open effort of knowledge building he dreamed of.[29][30][31] Initially, neither Sanger nor Wales knew what to expect from the Wikipedia initiative.[17][18] Wales feared that at worst, it might produce "complete rubbish".[17] To the surprise of Sanger and Wales, within a few days of launching the number of articles on Wikipedia had outgrown that of Nupedia, and a small collective of editors had formed.[16][18] Many of the early contributors to the site were familiar with the model of the free culture movement, and, like Wales, many of them sympathized with the open-source movement.[27] Wales has said that he was initially so worried with the concept of open editing, where anyone can edit the encyclopedia, that he would awake during the night and monitor what was being added.[32][33] Nonetheless, the cadre of early editors helped create a robust, self-regulating community that has proven conducive to the growth of the project.[11]
Sanger developed Wikipedia in its early phase and guided the project.[5][34] The broader idea he ascribes to Wales, remarking in a 2005 memoir for Slashdot that "the idea of an open source, collaborative encyclopedia, open to contribution by ordinary people, was entirely Jimmy's, not mine, and the funding was entirely by Bomis", adding, "the actual development of this encyclopedia was the task he gave me to work on."[35] Sanger worked on and promoted both the Nupedia and Wikipedia projects until Bomis discontinued funding for his position in February 2002;[36] Sanger resigned as editor-in-chief of Nupedia and as "chief organizer" of Wikipedia on March 1 of that year.[37][38] Early on, Bomis supplied the financial backing for Wikipedia,[34][39] and entertained the notion of placing advertisements on Wikipedia before costs were reduced with Sanger's departure and plans for a nonprofit foundation were advanced instead.[28]

Wales has asserted that he is the sole founder of Wikipedia,[6] and has publicly disputed Sanger's designation as a co-founder. Sanger and Wales were identified as co-founders at least as early as September 2001 by The New York Times and as founders in Wikipedia's first press release in January 2002.[41][42] In August of that year, Wales identified himself as "co-founder" of Wikipedia.[43] Sanger assembled on his personal webpage an assortment of links that appear to confirm the status of Sanger and Wales as co-founders.[5][44] For example, Sanger and Wales are historically cited or described in early news citations and press releases as co-founders.[5] Wales was quoted by The Boston Globe as calling Sanger's claim "preposterous" in February 2006,[45] and called "the whole debate silly" in an April 2009 interview.[46]
In late 2005, Wales edited his own biographical entry on the English Wikipedia. Writer Rogers Cadenhead drew attention to logs showing that in his edits to the page, Wales had removed references to Sanger as the co-founder of Wikipedia.[47][48] Sanger commented that "having seen edits like this, it does seem that Jimmy is attempting to rewrite history. But this is a futile process because in our brave new world of transparent activity and maximum communication, the truth will out."[21][49] Wales was also observed to have modified references to Bomis in a way that was characterized as downplaying the sexual nature of some of his former company's products.[17][21] Though Wales argued that his modifications were solely intended to improve the accuracy of the content,[21] he apologized for editing his own biography, a practice generally discouraged on Wikipedia.[21][49]
In a 2004 interview with Slashdot, Wales outlined his vision for Wikipedia: "Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That’s what we're doing."[50] Although his formal designation is board member and Chairman Emeritus of the Wikimedia Foundation, Wales' social capital within the Wikipedia community has accorded him a status that has been characterized as benevolent dictator, constitutional monarch and spiritual leader.[51][52][53] In a 2014 interview, Wales said that while he "has always rejected" the term "benevolent dictator," he does refer to himself as the "constitutional monarch."[54] He was also the closest the project had to a spokesperson in its early years.[4] The growth and prominence of Wikipedia made Wales an Internet celebrity.[55] Although he had never traveled outside North America prior to the site's founding, his participation in the Wikipedia project has seen him flying internationally on a near-constant basis as its public face.[4][56]
When Larry Sanger left Wikipedia, Wales' approach was different from Sanger's.[57] He was fairly hands-off.[57] Despite involvement in other projects, Wales has denied intending to reduce his role within Wikipedia, telling The New York Times in 2008 that "Dialing down is not an option for me ... Not to be too dramatic about it, but, 'to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language,' that's who I am. That's what I am doing. That's my life goal."[52] In May 2010, the BBC reported that Wales had relinquished many of his technical privileges on Wikimedia Commons (a Wikipedia sister project that hosts much of its multimedia content) after criticism by the project's volunteer community over what they saw as Wales' hasty and undemocratic approach to deleting sexually explicit images he believed "appeal solely to prurient interests".[58]
In mid-2003, Wales set up the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), a non-profit organization founded in St. Petersburg, Florida and later headquartered in San Francisco, California.[59][60] All intellectual property rights and domain names pertaining to Wikipedia were moved to the new foundation,[61] whose purpose is to establish general policy for the encyclopedia and its sister projects.[18] Wales has been a member of the Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees since it was formed and was its official chairman from 2003 through 2006.[62] Since 2006 he has been accorded the honorary title of Chairman Emeritus and holds the board-appointed "community founder" seat.[63] His work for the foundation, including his appearances to promote it at computer and educational conferences, has always been unpaid.[20] Wales has often joked that donating Wikipedia to the foundation was both the "dumbest and the smartest" thing he had done. On one hand, he estimated that Wikipedia was worth US$3 billion; on the other, he weighed his belief that the donation made its success possible.[24][61][64][65]
Wales' association with the foundation has led to controversy. In March 2008, Wales was accused by former Wikimedia Foundation employee Danny Wool of misusing the foundation's funds for recreational purposes.[66] Wool also stated that Wales had his Wikimedia credit card taken away in part because of his spending habits, a claim Wales denied.[66] Then-chairperson of the foundation Florence Devouard and former foundation interim Executive Director Brad Patrick denied any wrongdoing by Wales or the foundation, saying that Wales accounted for every expense and that, for items for which he lacked receipts, he paid out of his own pocket; in private, Devouard upbraided Wales for "constantly trying to rewrite the past".[67] Later in March 2008, it was claimed by Jeffrey Vernon Merkey that Wales had edited Merkey's Wikipedia entry to make it more favorable in return for donations to the Wikimedia Foundation, an allegation Wales dismissed as "nonsense".[68][69]
In 2004, Wales and then-fellow member of the WMF Board of Trustees Angela Beesley founded the for-profit company Wikia.[16] Wikia is a wiki farm – a collection of individual wikis on different subjects, all hosted on the same website. It hosts some of the largest wikis outside Wikipedia, including Memory Alpha (devoted to Star Trek) and Wookieepedia (Star Wars).[70] Another service offered by Wikia was Wikia Search, an open source search engine intended to challenge Google and introduce transparency and public dialogue about how it is created into the search engine's operations,[71] but the project was abandoned in March 2009.[72] Wales stepped down as Wikia CEO to be replaced by angel investor Gil Penchina, a former vice president and general manager at eBay, on June 5, 2006.[73] Penchina declared Wikia to have reached profitability in September 2009.[74] In addition to his role at Wikia, Wales is a public speaker represented by the Harry Walker Agency.[75][76] He has also participated in a celebrity endorsement campaign for the Swiss watch maker Maurice Lacroix.[77]
On November 4, 2011, Wales delivered an hour-long address at The Sage Gateshead in the United Kingdom to launch the 2011 Free Thinking Festival on BBC Radio Three.[78] His speech, which was entitled "The Future of the Internet", was largely devoted to Wikipedia. Twenty days later, on November 24, Wales appeared on the British topical debate television program Question Time.[79]
In May 2012, it was reported that Wales was advising the UK government on how to make taxpayer-funded academic research available on the internet at no cost.[80] His role reportedly involved working as "an unpaid advisor on crowdsourcing and opening up policymaking", and advising the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills and the UK research councils on distributing research.[80]
In January 2014 it was announced that Wales had joined The People's Operator as co-chair of the mobile phone network.[81]
On March 21, 2014, Wales spoke on a panel at a Clinton Global Initiative University conference held at Arizona State University, along with John McCain, Saudi Arabian women's rights activist Manal al-Sharif and Harvard University student Shree Bose.[82] The topic of discussion was "the age of participation" and the ability of an increasingly large number of citizens to "...express their own opinions, pursue their own educations, and launch their own enterprises." Wales exhorted young people to use social media to try to bring about societal change, and compared government suppression of the Internet to a human rights violation.[83]
On May 26, 2014, Google appointed Wales to serve on a seven-member committee on privacy in response to Google v. Gonzalez, which led to them being inundated with requests to remove websites from their search results. Wales said he wanted the committee to be viewed as "a blue-ribbon panel" by lawmakers and for the committee to advise them as well as Google.[84]
Wales is a self-avowed Objectivist,[71] referring to the philosophy invented by writer Ayn Rand in the mid-20th century emphasizing reason, individualism, and capitalism. Wales first encountered the philosophy through reading Rand's novel The Fountainhead while an undergraduate,[12] and in 1992 founded an electronic mailing list devoted to "Moderated Discussion of Objectivist Philosophy".[4][85] Though he has stated that the philosophy "colours everything I do and think",[4] he has said "I think I do a better job—than a lot of people who self-identify as Objectivists—of not pushing my point of view on other people."[86]
When asked by Brian Lamb about Rand's influence on him in his appearance on C-SPAN's Q&A in September 2005, Wales cited integrity and "the virtue of independence" as important to him personally. When asked if he could trace "the Ayn Rand connection" to having a political philosophy at the time of the interview, Wales labeled himself a libertarian, qualifying his remark by referring to the United States Libertarian Party as "lunatics" and citing "freedom, liberty, basically individual rights, that idea of dealing with other people in a matter that is not initiating force against them" as his guiding principles.[12] An interview with Wales served as the cover feature of the June 2007 issue of the libertarian magazine Reason.[11] In that profile, he described his political views as "center-right".
In a 2011 interview with The Independent, he expressed sympathy with the Occupy Wall Street and Occupy London protesters, saying, "You don't have to be a socialist to say it's not right to take money from everybody and give it to a few rich people. That's not free enterprise."[87]
The January/February 2006 issue of Maximum PC reported that Wales had refused to comply with a request from the People's Republic of China to censor "politically sensitive" articles in Wikipedia. Other big business Internet companies such as Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft had already yielded to Chinese government pressure. Wales let it be known that he would rather see companies such as Google follow suit on Wikipedia's policy of freedom of information.[88] In 2010, he criticized whistleblower website WikiLeaks and its editor in chief Julian Assange, saying that their publication of Afghan war documents "could be enough to get someone killed", and he expressed irritation at their use of the name "wiki":[89] "What they're doing is not really a wiki. The essence of wiki is a collaborative editing...".[90]
Wales cites Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek's essay "The Use of Knowledge in Society", which he read as an undergraduate,[17] as "central" to his thinking about "how to manage the Wikipedia project".[11] Hayek argued that information is decentralized – that each individual only knows a small fraction of what is known collectively – and that as a result, decisions are best made by those with local knowledge rather than by a central authority.[11] Wales reconsidered Hayek's essay in the 1990s, while reading about the open source movement (which advocated that software be free and distributed). He was moved in particular by "The Cathedral and the Bazaar", an essay and later book by one of the founders of the movement, Eric S. Raymond, which "opened [his] eyes to the possibilities of mass collaboration."[17]
From his background in finance and working as a futures and options trader, Wales developed an interest in game theory and the effect of incentives on human collaborative activity, a fascination to which he credits enabling much of his effort with Wikipedia.[91] He has rejected the notion that his role in promoting Wikipedia is altruistic, which he defines as "sacrificing your own values for others", stating "[t]hat participating in a benevolent effort to share information is somehow destroying your own values makes no sense to me".[56]
Wales petitioned the Home Secretary of the United Kingdom against the extradition of Richard O'Dwyer to the USA.[92] After an agreement was reached to avoid the extradition, Wales commented, "This is very exciting news, and I'm pleased to hear it... What needs to happen next is a serious reconsideration of the UK extradition treaty that would allow this sort of nonsense in the first place."[93]
Commentators noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.[94] In August 2013, Jimmy Wales criticized U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron's Internet porn-filter, saying the plan is "ridiculous."[94]
In November 2013, commenting on the Snowden affair, Wales described Edward Snowden as "a hero" whom history would judge "very favourably", and pointed out that in his view the US public "would have never approved [the] sweeping surveillance program [publicized by Snowden]", had they been informed or asked about it.[95]
Wales has criticized holistic health, a form of alternative medicine, as "the work of lunatic charlatans," and for not being based on peer-reviewed studies.[97]
On May 14, 2014, Wales reacted to the European Court of Justice's ruling that people have the right to have Google remove search results about them. He told the BBC that the ruling was "one of the most wide-sweeping internet censorship rulings that I've ever seen".[98]
Jimmy Wales has been married three times. At the age of twenty, he married Pamela Green,[99] a co-worker at a grocery-store in Alabama.[56] They divorced in 1993.[15] He met his second wife, Christine Rohan, through a friend in Chicago while she was working as a steel trader for Mitsubishi.[12][14] The couple were married in Monroe County, Florida in March 1997,[100] and had a daughter before separating.[12][56] Wales moved to San Diego in 1998, and after being dissuaded by the housing market there, relocated in 2002 to St. Petersburg, Florida,.[14][39][101]
Wales had a brief relationship with Canadian conservative columnist Rachel Marsden in 2008 that began after Marsden contacted Wales about her Wikipedia biography.[102] After accusations that Wales' relationship constituted a conflict of interest, Wales stated that there had been a relationship but that it was over and claimed that it had not influenced any matters on Wikipedia,[103][104] a claim which was disputed by Marsden.[105]
Wales married Kate Garvey in London on October 6, 2012.[106] She is Tony Blair's former diary secretary, whom he met in Davos, Switzerland.[107][108] Wales has two daughters: one with his second wife and one with Garvey.
Wales is an atheist. In an interview with Big Think, he said his personal philosophy is firmly rooted in reason and he is a complete non-believer.[109] As of 2012 he lives in London, England.[1]
Wales is a member of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School,[12] the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence,[110] and the board of directors at Creative Commons[111] and Hunch.com.[112] He is a former co-chair of the World Economic Forum on the Middle East 2008,[113] and a former board member of Socialtext.[114]
Wales was listed in the "Scientists & Thinkers" section of the Time 100 in 2006[115] and number 12 in Forbes "The Web Celebs 25".[116] Wales has also given a lecture in the Stuart Regen Visionary series at New Museum which "honors special individuals who have made major contributions to art and culture, and are actively imagining a better future"[117] and by the World Economic Forum as one of the "Young Global Leaders" of 2007.[118] In April 2011, Wales served on the jury of the Tribeca Film Festival.[119] In February 2014, Wales was named one of "25 Web Superstars" by The Daily Telegraph.[120]
Wales has received a Pioneer Award,[121] the Gottlieb Duttweiler Prize and the Leonardo European Corporate Learning Award[122] in 2011,[123][124] the Monaco Media Prize,[125] the 2009 Nokia Foundation annual award,[126] the Business Process Award at the 7th Annual Innovation Awards and Summit by The Economist,[127] the 2008 Global Brand Icon of the Year Award,[128] and on behalf of the Wikimedia project the Quadriga award of Werkstatt Deutschland for A Mission of Enlightenment.[129] Wales has also received honorary degrees from Knox College,[130] Amherst College,[131] Stevenson University,[131][132] Argentina's Universidad Empresarial Siglo 21,[133] and Russia's MIREA University.[134]
On December 5, 2013, Wales was awarded the UNESCO Niels Bohr Medal in Copenhagen, Denmark at a conference on "An Open World" to celebrate to 100th anniversary of Niels Bohr's atomic theory. His presentation on "Wikipedia, Democracy and the Internet" emphasised the need to expand Wikipedia into virtually all the languages of the world. The "Wikipedia Zero" initiative was beginning to prove successful in encouraging telecommunications companies to provide children in the developing world with free access to Wikipedia for educational purposes.[135][136]
On May 17, 2014, Wales became Doctor Honoris Causa of the Faculty of Communication Sciences of the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI Lugano, Switzerland).[137]

Ranked by Forbes Magazine as a “Web Celeb”, Jimmy Donal Wales is a U.S. Internet entrepreneur, wiki pioneer, and technology visionary, who is best known as the Founder of Wikipedia, an international collaborative free content encyclopedia on the Internet, and the Wikimedia Foundation. He is co-founder of Wikia, a privately owned free web hosting service he set up in 2004.
The origins of Wikipedia began in March 2000, when Mr. Wales started Nupedia (“the free encyclopedia”), which was characterized by an extensive peer-review process
designed to make its articles of a quality comparable to that of professional encyclopedias. With the addition of wikis (a collection of web pages designed to enable anyone who accesses it to contribute or modify content), the project was dubbed “Wikipedia.” Mr. Wales laid down the founding principles and content, establishing an Internet-based community of contributors during that year. Wikipedia was initially intended to be a wiki-based site for collaboration on early encyclopedic content for submission to
In a 2004 interview with Slashdot, Mr. Wales explained his motivations about Wikipedia, “Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That’s what we’re doing.” The success of the project has helped popularize a trend in web development (called Web 2.0) that aims to
facilitate creativity, collaboration, and sharing among users. As Wikipedia expanded and its public profile grew, Mr. Wales took on the role of the project’s spokesperson and promoter through speaking engagements and media appearances. His work with Wikipedia, which has become the world’s largest encyclopedia, prompted TIME Magazine to name him one of its “100 Most Influential People,” in 2006 in the “Scientists & Thinkers” category.
In 2003, Mr. Wales founded the Wikimedia Foundation, a nonprofit charitable organization dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free, multilingual content, and to providing the full content of these wiki-based projects to the public free of charge. The Wikimedia Foundation operates some of the largest collaboratively edited reference projects in the world, including Wikipedia, the 5th most popular website in the world.
In 2004, Wales co-founded, with Angela Beesley, the for-profit company Wikia, Inc. Wikia is a wiki farm – a collection of individual wikis on different subjects, all hosted on the same website. As part of his work at Wikia, Inc., Mr. Wales is developing a human-powered search engine, Search Wikia, which will be based on the same open, transparent, community-driven principles of Wikia and Wikipedia.
The World Economic Forum recognized Wales as one of the “Young Global Leaders” of 2007. This prestigious award acknowledges the top 250 young leaders across the world for their professional accomplishments, their commitment to society, and their potential to contribute to shaping the future of the world.
Mr. Wales is a Fellow of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School. He serves on the Board of Directors of Socialtext, a provider of wiki technology to businesses and the non-profit organization Creative Commons. Mr. Wales has received an honorary doctorate from Knox College of Illinois and was presented with a Pioneer Award from the Electronic Frontier Foundation in 2006.
Mr. Wales received his bachelor’s degree in finance from Auburn University and started with the Ph.D. finance program at the University of Alabama, where he left with a Master’s. After that, he took courses offered in the Ph.D. finance program at Indiana University. He taught at both universities during his postgraduate studies, but did not write the doctoral dissertation required to earn a Ph.D.
From 1994 to 2000, Wales was the research director at Chicago Options Associates, a futures and options trading firm in Chicago.
I love Wikipedia and would like to contribute but cannot do so because I currently live in a country which restricts foreign currency transactions, this makes me feel as a free-loader and really bad. But it occurs to me that I would contribute yearly if I could do so in my local currency – so here goes my question to you, have you considered making it easier for all of us who would contribute?  Wikipedia reaches all corners of the globe and I wonder if it would be worthwhile for the Foundation to set up the financial structures necessary to receive funds in other currencies (although in countries such as the one I currently live, this would then generate the hurdle of having to deal with repatriation of funds which is a nightmare for most multinationals – but not impossible and therefore ultimately additive).
First, my hat’s off to your work – I find Wikipedia being a fantastic accomplishment! I also thank to all contributors! I’d like to suggest adding a new dimension to it.
How about creating and establishing a designation program in science? Something similar to the CFA program in finance…”Wiki-Degree” would be structured by educational & scientific experts and in consultation with practical industry needs. The information is already part of Wikipedia, it just needs to be shaped in a “targeted expertise package” (e.g. chartered chemist, chartered biologist, chartered scientific associate etc.). Wikipedia has an educational advantage because of linking everything and having very fresh information…and I know the Wiki-team has capacity to make this happen.
There are millions of brilliant minds in the world who would be happy to study hard and become valuable experts if not hindered by poverty or lack of proper educational institutions. It’s a chance for honest and hardworking talents to do more. The severity of the program would sort out only the really dedicated individuals. By making “Wiki-Degree” available for a low fee (an income without advertising), the world would be enriched with generations who understand the world better and act accordingly, creating a bright future for all. Also, with widely educated population, the value systems will evolve constructively. It would be a game-changer!
I get whatever information I need through wikipedia.  Students doing Ph.D can get various details through your wikipedia.  You are doing a great job for people across the globe.  But you need money to maintain it.  Indians may not opt for online payment etc. So, Pls open account in a nationalised bank in India and flash the account number in wikipedia for donation so that you will get plenty of donations.
wow.. at last, somehow I found you. and I want to tell you that… I hope you’ll do more great things for ‘humanity’. Good job.
Mr. Wales – I apologize for my 2011 email, for taking out Israel’s bad behavior on you! I love the concept of Wikipedia – and it is pitiful that the pro-Israel machine has targeted y’all.  It is just such an emotional issue….  There has to be a way to counter such attacks – I guess it means more fundraising…. I will encourage people to support Wikipedia. Happy 2012.  Peace, Maggi Carter
Please tell me you are going to fight SOPA and PIPA!  Get people involved.  Lamar Smith really isn’t as smart as he thinks apparently.  I learned that when he opened his mouth.  Censorship has no place in the U.S., we already have so many things that are censored and monitored.  The internet does NOT need to be one of the governments victims.
Welcome back, Wikipedia! I think we don’t realize how much we rely on the quick information until it’s gone for a day!
I am really very Happy to know about Wikipedia back. Thanks you. You are not save you. You save us because we find a lots of knowledge through wiki in many language.
hello jimmy, I’m proud to say that I’m one of the mad lover of wikipedia. there are thousands like me here in India. but our regret is that most of us couldn’t donate to wiki coz we have heart but not the way. almost everyone here owns a mobile. if it is possible for you to get partnership with mobile companies here in India so that we can send our little contribution by means of sms or recharge or something like that. please consider this request. once we love you jimmy for your greatest contribution of free knowledge.
I’m a fellow Chicago-boy living in Europe. We rely on Wikipedia across the Continent and the UK for quick references and as a starting point for doing any research.  Wikipedia provides additional references and cross references for one to truly seek out the facts they need or conduct more research. Considering the IQ of the average Congressional Member is lower than a 5th grader  (presumably at a poorly funded state school – I used to work on the Hill and the moron factor is shockingly high)- and their ability to keep up with what their real voting constiuents want is abysmal at best. One might be amazed that things have gotten this far to destroy such a vital internet-based research tool, clearly founded in the spirit and purpose of the internet by its founder. One might also be amazed that the will of the few still dictate to the many what will govern the people of America. However, one shouldn’t be amazed. For as long as lobbying, PAC contributions and the like exist in the US, Congress will always have a reason and funding for bullying its citizens out of their rights, oddly enough, “enshrined” in the US Bill of Rights, on behalf of commercial interests of teh few.  When the now thankfully deceased Jack Valenti (sp?) led Hollywood’s crusade against IP infringement on behalf of the music and film industry. He and those who funded his crusade under teh banner of IP protection actually put intellectual freedom in the US on a short, slippery slope into the abyss of full censorship – maybe not government censorship, but rather commercial censorship…afterall commercial interests fully drive the political interests in a PAC-fed US Congress.  I live in Germany where an industry group (GEMA?) of media enterprises blocks one from watching YouTube content posted from the US.  What we have here is not unlike teh censorship US legislators oppose.  Sharing information, etc. amounts to fording the wide gap of ignorance. If we cannot cure “ignorance” then we bred intolerance, beligerance, which then leads to superstition and stupidity…four qualities of the legislators trying to shut down the like of Wikipedia and other intellectual communities.  (Why wont teh US Congress focus on truly harmful things instead like child porn sites, etc. and protect us instead of hindering us?) Thanks for the chance to rant!  My paypal donation is on its way.
I hope that you will read this post. I have been following the news related to SOPA and spreading the word on Facebook throughout the entire January. Big respect for what you have done. There is another problem tho which has recently appeared on the horizon. ACTA. Probably you already know about it. Polish goverment is due to sign it next week, on Thu 26th of January.  Young people like me are doing what they can to protest against ACTA and to prevent it being signed, but the goverment remains deaf to our protest and sees nothing wrong with it. As far as I am concerned Polish Wikipedia is planning to protest, maybe together with the French, German and Czech, but so far no proper plans and arrangements have been made… I think this is not enough tho, people are planning to go out and protest on the streets, but I do not know if it is going to be enough to convince the goverment. No major newspapers and online news portals have posted anything about it untill today evening, general public has been fed with some stupid news instead. Maybe you could somehow help to stop this madness, we will not stop fighting but we definitely need support….
 Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing.

Jimmy WalesInventor / EntrepreneurBorn: August 1966Birthplace: Huntsville, AlabamaBest known as: The driving force behind WikipediaJimmy Wales is the Internet entrepreneur who led the creation of the online encyclopedia known as Wikipedia.  Wales worked as a research director for Chicago Options Associates before becoming a co-founder (with Tim Shell) of the successful website Bomis.com in 1996. Wales used profits from Bomis.com to start an online encyclopedia, Nupedia, which led in 2001 to the creation of Wikipedia -- a free online encyclopedia which allowed anyone to create new entries or edit existing entries. As Wikipedia grew in prominence, so did Wales: Time magazine named him one of its 100 most influential people of 2006.   Wales turned control of Wikipedia over to Wikimedia, a non-profit organization, in 2003.  He remains head of a separate for-profit company, Wikia Inc., which hosts in-depth  "wiki" web pages on various topics.Extra credit: Wales is sometimes called by the nickname Jimbo... According to his Wikipedia entry, Wales has a bachelor's degree in finance from Auburn University and a master's degree in the same topic from the University of Alabama... Wales gave the birthdate of Wikipedia as 15 January 2001 in a 2007 interview with New Scientist magazine...  The name Wikipedia was coined by Larry Sanger, the former editor of Nupedia. Sanger is sometimes called a co-founder of Wikipedia, though Wales himself rejects that notion, noting that Sanger was his employee... Wales's date of birth is unclear; most sources say August 7th or August 8th, but Wales himself has avoided stating the date publicly.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC.

Jimmy Wales is the co-founder of the politically left online encyclopedia Wikipedia and self-described libertarian.  Jimmy Wales claims to be an objectivist who follows the philosophy of atheist Ayn Rand. His favorite book is Rand's Atlas Shrugged.[1]  Wales told an interviewer in Reason magazine, "One can't understand my ideas about Wikipedia without understanding Hayek...Wales is fleshing out and bringing to life Hayek's insights about the power of decentralized knowledge gathering, the surprising strength of communities bound only by reputation, and the fluidity of self-governance." [2] These ideas that Wales claims to follow were put forward in Hayek's essay "The Use of Knowledge in Society". However there is thin evidence for his being a true follower of Hayek politically given the radical leftist agenda of Wales close confidants in control of Wikipedia.[3] Wales describes himself as a  communitarian (someone who could be said to be "radical center", meaning they agree with the left on issues relating to the economy, such as the need for environmental protection and public education, but not on cultural issues, but instead generally agree with the right or conservatives on cultural issues, such as support for character education and faith-based programs).[3] The revisions have since been deleted by liberal Wikipedia administrators wishing to protect Jimmy's public image.[4] Editors trying to make this point in Wikipedia are routinely profiled, stalked, harassed, slandered, and banned. An irony of internet history is that Jimmy Wales, despite being an atheist, refers to himself as Wikipedia's "spiritual leader".[5]
Jimmy Wales became a millionaire by trading commodity options; before funding Wikipedia, he funded Bomis Inc. in 1996, which contained pornographic material.[6]  Besides funding the non-profit Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales also funded the for-profit Wikia, a company that provides wiki services for businesses and organizations.
Wales was caught editing his own profile on Wikipedia in a bit of a scandal in an effort to downplay Larry Sanger's role in the company and distance himself from his Bomis past.[7]
In early October 2005, former Robert F. Kennedy aide and retired journalist John Seigenthaler Sr. contacted Wales about false and libelous information in his Wikipedia biographical entry. Essjay got the call to deal with the situation.[8] On December 1, 2005 Wales told Editor & Publisher magazine, the nation’s oldest trade journal serving the newspaper industry regarding Daniel Brandt, 
 I don't regard him as a valid source about anything at all... I find it hard to take him very seriously ...[9]
Brandt was the victim of malicious[10] and vile slanders  placed within his Wikipedia biographical entry[11] by prominent Wikipedia contributors, in violation of numerous published Wikipedia policies.[12] Four days later in a joint appearance with Seigenthaler on CNN Wales said,
Essjay was entrusted with oversight responsibilities in the wake of the Seigenthaler scandal and wrote to a professor to persuade her to allow students to cite Wikipedia as a "reliable source,"
 It is never the case that known incorrect information is allowed to remain in Wikipedia; we strive to provide a resource that is both accurate and expansive. As we approach one million articles (far more than any other encyclopedia could ever hope to attain) on the English Wikipedia alone (there are hundreds of thousands of articles in the projects that make up the Wikimedia Foundation in dozens of different languages), we prove ourselves as a resource like none ever known before.
The derogatory smears against Brandt, self-cited to a certifiably "extremist source" which "should never be used" remained in Brandt's biography for one and half years, with Jimmy Wales and the WikiMedia Foundations full knowledge.
On December 14, 2012, WND columnist Judith Reisman defended heavy-metal drummer Bradlee Dean, who had been unfairly attacked on Wikipedia. She wrote,
"Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia’s creator, made his original fortune as a pornography trafficker. Wales’ cult of far-leftist volunteer editor zealots labor minute-by-minute to mislead readers who think Wikipedia’s half-truths – and worse – are a legitimate 'encyclopedia.'"
Wales sent an email in response claiming, "I have never been a 'pornography trafficker' at all." Instead of posting a correction WND posted detailed documentation which includes a posed photo of Wales flanked by two mostly undressed female models.[14]
Some people start discussions on his user talk page much as supplicants approach a monarch.  In response, he might engage in a discussion, promise "to look into it", or simply delete it.[15]  However, the number of deletions and users banished from his talk page have increased in 2013.

With a vision for a free online encyclopedia, Wales assembled legions of volunteer contributors, gave them tools for collaborating, and created the self-organizing, self-correcting, ever-expanding, multilingual encyclopedia of the future.
Jimmy Wales went from betting on interest rates and foreign-currency fluctuations (as an option trader) to betting on the willingness of people to share their knowledge. That's how Wikipedia, imagined in 2001, became one of the most-referenced, most-used repositories of knowledge on the planet, with more than four and a half million articles in English (compared with the Britannica's 80,000) and millions in dozens of other languages, all freely available. The "wiki" in the name refers to software that allows anyone with Internet access to add, delete or edit entries. This has led to controversies about the reliability of the information, prompting the Wikimedia Foundation  to set tighter rules for editors, while still keeping Wikipedia  open-source. One thing is certain: Wikipedia  will never be finished. In the meantime Wales has started working on Wikiasari, a wiki-style search engine.
"Wikipedia represents a belief in the supremacy of reason and the goodness of others. ... From the respectful clash of opposing viewpoints and the combined wisdom of the many, something resembling the truth will emerge. Most of the time." —

Simply having rules does not change the things that people want to do. You have to change incentives.
Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing.
I frequently counsel people who are getting frustrated about an edit war to think about someone who lives without clean drinking water, without any proper means of education, and how our work might someday help that person. It puts flamewars into some perspective, I think.
[Wikipedia is] like a sausage: you might like the taste of it, but you don't necessarily want to see how it's made.
Alluding to a famous quote "Laws are like sausages — it is better not to see them being made.", generally attributed to Otto von Bismarck.
When someone just writes 'f**k, f**k, f**k', we just fix it, laugh and move on. But the difficult social issues are the borderline cases — people who do some good work, but who are also a pain in the neck.
Wikipedia is first and foremost an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language. Asking whether the community comes before or after this goal is really asking the wrong question: the entire purpose of the community is precisely this goal.
Ideally, our rules should be formed in such a fashion that an ordinary helpful kind thoughtful person doesn't really even need to know the rules. You just get to work, do something fun, and nobody hassles you as long as you are being thoughtful and kind.
The real struggle is not between the right and the left but between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerks.
We are growing from a cheerful small town where everyone waves off their front porch to the subway of New York City where everyone rushes by. How do you preserve the culture that has worked so well?
Frankly, and let me be blunt, Wikipedia as a readable product is not for us. It's for them. It's for that girl in Africa who can save the lives of hundreds of thousands of people around her, but only if she's empowered with the knowledge to do so.
We are Wikipedians. This means that we should be: kind, thoughtful, passionate about getting it right, open, tolerant of different viewpoints, open to criticism, bold about changing our policies and also cautious about changing our policies. We are not vindictive, childish, and we don't stoop to the level of our worst critics, no matter how much we may find them to be annoying.
It is pretty weird. A few years ago, I was just some guy sitting in front of the internet. Now I send an e-mail or edit an article and it makes headlines around the world ... I used to be just a guy — now I'm Jimmy Wales.
We come from geek culture, we come from the free software movement, we have a lot of technologists involved. If we had done the same sort of comparison on poets or artists, I think that we would not have fared nearly as well.
It turns out a lot of people don’t get it. Wikipedia is like rock’n’roll; it’s a cultural shift.

Edit comment, removing attempts to minimize the significance of the Wikipedia:Ignore all rules policy statement (19 August 2006)
Quite frankly, several of the people who contributed to the article should be banned from coming near a keyboard until they have learned to engage in proper encyclopedia writing.
I think that argument is completely morally bankrupt, and I think people know that when they make it. There's a very big difference between having a sincere, passionate interest in a topic and being a paid shill ... Particularly for PR firms, it's something they should really very strongly avoid: ever touching an article.

Wikipedia is a non-profit. It was either the dumbest thing I ever did or the smartest thing I ever did.
Simply having rules does not change the things that people want to do. You have to change incentives.
I think MySpace is doomed, I give them about two more years.... I think Facebook is the next Microsoft in both the bad and the good senses. That's an amazing company that is going to do a lot of good and bad things.
Greatest misconception about Wikipedia: We aren’t democratic. Our readers edit the entries, but we’re actually quite snobby. The core community appreciates when someone is knowledgeable, and thinks some people are idiots and shouldn’t be writing.
There’s plenty of rude stuff online. People say things online that they would be ashamed to say face to face. If people could treat others as though they were speaking face to face, that would be huge.
I have said this many times in the past and will say it many times in the future I am sure: some people need to find a different hobby, because whatever they are here for, it is not to help build an encyclopedia.
We are going to change the [GNU] Free Documentation License in such a way that Wikipedia will be able to become licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License. And so this is not, as some people speculated on Facebook my 50th birthday party. This is a party to celebrate the liberation of Wikipedia.
Announcing that the Wikimedia Foundation Board has voted to enable Wikipedia to be licensed under a Creative Commons license. "Wikipedia to be Licensed Under Creative Commons" (30 November 2007)
Given enough time humans will screw up Wikipedia just as they have screwed up everything else, but so far it's not too bad.
I don't really agree that most academics frown when they hear Wikipedia. Most academics I find quite passionate about the concept of Wikipedia and like it quite a bit. [...] The number of academics who really really don't like Wikipedia is really quite small and we find that they get reported on in the media far out of proportion to the amount they actually exist.
We are a passionate community of volunteers who are trying to create a free encyclopedia for every single person on the planet. So we don't often think in terms of competition. We are going to do what we do and we hope Google does wonderful things as well. [...] If we were approaching this as a business we would think always: Oh, how can we position ourselves on the market... We just don't do any of that stuff.
I have my team focused on the front end, working on the user experience, and making sure we have all the wiki-like tools people need to work on the site. We're just cranking away.

To me the key thing is getting it right. And if a person's really smart and they're doing fantastic work, I don't care if they're a high school kid or a Harvard professor; it's the work that matters.
I'm on it pretty much all the time. I edit Wikipedia every day, I'm on Facebook, I'm on Twitter, I'm reading the news. During one of the US elections, I actually went through my computer and I blocked myself from looking at the major newspaper sites and Google News because I wasn't getting any work done.
What we won't do is pretend that the work of lunatic charlatans is the equivalent of "true scientific discourse." It isn't.
Boingboing.net, Jimmy Wales tells "energy workers" that Wikipedia won't publish woo, "the work of lunatic charlatans isn't the equivalent of 'true scientific discourse'"
Wales: You know, I don't know. I used to think so but I just was in Germany where Wikipedia is really big in Germany[..]. And Brockhaus is the — is the publisher of the Britannica style traditional encyclopedia. And their sales are up 30 percent in the last year even though Wikipedia is going through the roof. And I think there's a certain maybe there ends up being some complementarity to it that people[..]. So Wikipedia helps people to remember that hey, there is actually something to having a group of people edit, monitor, and put a level of trust to information. And so that makes Brockhaus more appealing, makes Wikipedia more appealing. So it's hard to say.
Lamb: Another thing I read about you is that you are a follower or have been at some point a follower of Ayn Rand?
Wales: Yes. So Ayn Rand is the — she wrote Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, as is viewed by many as, you know, something of the founder of the libertarian strain of thought in the U.S. She would have rejected quite rightly, I think, the libertarian label. But I think for me one of the core things that is very applicable to my life today is the virtue of independence — is the vision, you know, if you know the idea of Howard Roark who is the architect in The Fountainhead who has a vision for what he wants to accomplish and, you know, there's some time in the book when he is frustrated in his career because people don't want to build the type of buildings he wants to build. And he's given a choice, a difficult choice, to compromise his integrity or to essentially go out of business. And he has to go and take a job working in a quarry. And for me that model has a lot of — a lot of resonance for me. You know when I think about what I'm doing — what I'm doing and the way I'm doing it is more important to me than any amount of money or anything like that because it's my artistic work.
The more time I spent on the site the more I came to think of Wales as some kind of Queen Ant, letting the vast colony go about its work, at the centre of a system where the knowledge of the community is infinitely larger than the sum of experience of all its individuals.

Jimmy Donal Wales is an internet entrepreneur the co-founder of Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia that runs with an open management style. Times magazine named him in their list of ‘The 100 Most Influential People in the World’ in 2006. 
Wales was born on 7th August 1966 in Huntsville, Alabama. He had a keen interest in general knowledge since he was a child. He accredits the Montessori Method of his schools education that was to spend a lot of time reading the Britannica’s and the World Book Encyclopedias. Wales went to Randolph School where he graduated at 16. He then enrolled in Auburn University to gain his bachelor’s degree. He received his master’s degree from University of Alabama. Jimmy Wales landed a job with Chicago Options Associates, a trading firm in Illinois. He recalls himself as being completely addicted to the internet. He even wrote computer codes as a leisure activity. Wales got inspired from Netscape’s outstanding public offering in 1995 and thus left the territory of financial trading to become an internet entrepreneur. The next year he ventured into a web portal named ‘Bomis’ that featured webrings generated by the users and erotic pictures. This however did not prove to be very successful. Although this project was not as fruitful as Wales had expected, it encouraged him to begin another endeavor, one that was also his passion; an online encyclopedia. He started ‘Nupedia’ in 2000 with Larry Sanger, a PhD student at Ohio State University, as its editor-in-chief. In 2001 an extreme programming expert, Ben Kovitz introduced the wiki concept to Wales. The main writing experts of Nupedia were not very interested in this idea because they believed it would harm the credibility of the encyclopedia.
Sanger and Wales both believed in this project thus they initiated it from another domain. Wales hoped that this would start the knowledge building that he had always wanted. Fortunately for the duo, the website had more articles than Nupedia in just a few days. Wales feared the fact that anyone could add whatever they wanted so much so that it had him awake at nights. However, the team of editors made sure that robust and good quality content was being added to the encyclopedia. There was some controversy between Wales and Sanger as Wales claimed to be the sole founder of the website. In 2003 Wales established the Wikimedia Foundation (a non-profit organization) in St. Petersburg, Florida. This was done in order to support the Wikipedia project along with other sister projects. 
Jimmy Wales was listed in Time 100 ‘Scientists and Thinkers’ section in 2006. Forbes named him as one of ‘The Web Celeb 25’ and as one of the ‘Young Global Leaders’ in 2007. He has been honored with the ‘Pioneer Award’ and the ‘Gottlieb Duttweiler Prize’ in 2011. He has received other awards such as the ‘2009 Nokia Foundation’ annual award, the ‘Business Process’ award and ‘the 2008 Global Brand Icon of the Year Award’. He has also been awarded honorary degrees from Stevenson University, Amherst College, Knox College, MIREA University in Russia and Universidad Empresarial Siglo 21 of Argentina.

 The boring university lecture is going to be the first major casualty of the rise in online learning in higher education, says Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales.
The custodian of the world's biggest online encyclopaedia says that unless universities respond to the rising tide of online courses new major players will emerge to displace them, in the way that Microsoft arrived from nowhere alongside the personal computer.
"I think that the impact is going to be massive and transformative," says Mr Wales, describing the importance of the MOOCs  (massive open online courses) that have signed up millions of students.
"It's also been slower than anyone would have anticipated. But I'm not a person who thinks that people will be able to just go online and get a complete education without the guidance of the teacher. That sort of simplistic model shouldn't be our framework."
And from his own experience as a student, the traditional university lecture should have been condemned decades ago and replaced with an online video recording that can be stopped and started.
"I was taking an advanced calculus class and my instructor was reputed to be a fabulous researcher, but he barely spoke English. He was a very boring and bad teacher and I was absolutely lost and in despair. 
"So I went to the campus tutoring centre and they had Betamax tapes of a professor who had won teaching awards. Basically I sat with those tapes and took class there. But I still had to go to the other one and sat there and wanted to kill myself.
 Hoax entries included a biography of blues singer Snow Blind Driveway; wet floor warning signs dating to 220BC; Reich Corps of the Trombone set up by Goebbels; and that Brierfield in Lancashire was the inspiration for JRR Tolkien's evil land of Mordor
 "I thought at that time, in the future, why wouldn't you have the most entertaining professor, the one with the proven track record of getting knowledge into people's heads?
"We're still not quite there. In university you're still likely to be in a large lecture hall with a very boring professor, and everyone knows it's not working very well. It's not even the best use of that professor's time or the audience."
Online courses provide such libraries of video lectures, supplemented with interactive information, that can be used at any time on a tablet computer or laptop. 
And Mr Wales suggests the future model of higher education will be to allow students to use recordings of lectures - and to use the teaching time to discuss and develop what students have been watching.
Wikipedia itself is central to this changing landscape in which huge amounts of high-quality information are available free anywhere with an internet connection.
The sheer scale of the information and the volume of its consumption has no parallel in history. Wikipedia's latest internet traffic is running at more than 21 billion page impressions per month.
But he says it remains uncertain whether universities will be ready to change. "There's a certain inertia in the system."
"The really interesting challenge for big-brand universities is whether they are going to move into that space. If we thought of universities as normal businesses we would say, 'Will they be able to adapt to the PC revolution?' It's that kind of question. Will Harvard or MIT, Oxford or Cambridge, be able to adapt? Or will Microsoft come out of nowhere?
In terms of technology in education, he says we should look at how it's being driven by interest in home schooling.
"There are a load of online educational resources, they're booming. Parents are looking for the best education for their kids, they realise these tools are working. There's a marketplace for it long before the traditional school is going to think about it."
Mr Wales himself grew up in a small private school run by his mother and grandmother in Alabama. There were four other children in his grade.
An important part of Wikipedia's future focus, he says, is going to reach the modern world's version of isolated school houses in the developing world. 
In wealthier countries there might be the luxury of a debate about whether Wikipedia is better or worse than printed encyclopaedias. But Mr Wales wants to support languages in Africa where there have never been encyclopaedias in the first place.
What is much more deeply political is the concept of Wikipedia, that ordinary people should be able to participate in the grand human dialogue. It's a very subversive idea in a society that is top-down”
 Wikipedia operates in 286 different languages, but the content is very unevenly spread. There are more than 4 million articles in English, while Xhosa, spoken by almost 8 million people in South Africa, only has 147 articles.
"We've still got a long way to go. I'd say we've increasingly turned our focus to the languages of the developing world. It's really of great importance. Our goal is a free encyclopaedia for everyone in their own language."
He rejects the idea that Wikipedia's instant knowledge represents some kind of dumbing down. It has long been accused of being the hidden hand in countless school and university assignments.
But Mr Wales says it plays a vital democratic role in allowing ordinary people to become informed in a way that would never have been possible before.
If there is a story in the news, people can find out the background for themselves. "We can see it in our traffic. There's a massive spike.
"In some rose-coloured view of the past we all went home and read books about it. The truth is that we didn't.
"It's remarkable that people now have the opportunity. It's not a Utopian state, but people have the possibility to do their own research."
Mr Wales also defends what Wikipedia represents for free speech in countries with censorship and a lack of human rights. 
"The impact of the knowledge we bring is important, but what is much more deeply political is the concept of Wikipedia, that ordinary people should be able to participate in the grand human dialogue. 
"It's a very subversive idea in a society that is top-down and 'do as your masters tell you,'" he says.
The online encyclopaedia is now 12 years old, launched in the same month as iTunes and when Greece adopted the euro. It has grown to 26 million articles and has more than 500 million individual users a month.
Wikipedia's next development will be to make it easier for a wider variety of people to write and edit articles, with an editing tool that is more user-friendly.
"For people who aren't computer geeks, it's intimidating. The user base of active editors tend to be computer-savvy. We want to diversify, so they can be geeks but not computer geeks."
Of course, there's still a big unanswered question. How would the king of Wikipedia get on in a pub quiz? Would he have to illicitly check his smartphone under the table?
"I've declined to go on a TV quiz show. There's no upside for me. Unless I get every single question right I'm going to be subject to mockery. Because I'm meant to be the encyclopaedia guy."

A St Andrean in exile  1st May 2013 - 12:29   I prophesy that university as we know it shall disappear in 20 years.  All the permanent lecturer/professorial posts; all the ceremonial paraphenalia; all the degree awards and titles; even the old-fashioned written exams.  Universities have lost the plot.  They are obsessed with abstract research rankings and administration, rather than training people for employment in industry.

Millennium Peregrine  1st May 2013 - 12:18   Universities are not schools. Most lecturers are researchers fulfilling their required allocation of teaching time, rather than teachers. While a dull lecturing style can be difficult to deal with, most university learning should be self-directed; the lecturer is there to facilitate, not supply all the answers up front. How could you ask questions, or for clarification, from an uploaded recording?
