=======================================================
With The Wealth of Nations Adam Smith installed himself as the leading expositor of economic thought. Currents of Adam Smith run through the works published by David Ricardo and Karl Marx in the nineteenth century, and by John Maynard Keynes and Milton Friedman in the twentieth.
Adam Smith was born in a small village in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, where his widowed mother raised him. At age fourteen, as was the usual practice, he entered the University of Glasgow on scholarship. He later attended Balliol College at Oxford, graduating with an extensive knowledge of European literature and an enduring contempt for English schools.
He returned home, and after delivering a series of well-received lectures was made first chair of logic (1751), then chair of moral philosophy (1752), at Glasgow University.
He left academia in 1764 to tutor the young duke of Buccleuch. For more than two years they traveled throughout France and into Switzerland, an experience that brought Smith into contact with his contemporaries Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, François Quesnay, and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot. With the life pension he had earned in the service of the duke, Smith retired to his birthplace of Kirkcaldy to write The Wealth of Nations. It was published in 1776, the same year the American Declaration of Independence was signed and in which his close friend David Hume died. In 1778 he was appointed commissioner of customs. In this job he helped enforce laws against smuggling. In The Wealth of Nations, he had defended smuggling as a legitimate activity in the face of “unnatural” legislation. Adam Smith never married. He died in Edinburgh on July 19, 1790.
Today Smith’s reputation rests on his explanation of how rational self-interest in a free-market economy leads to economic well-being. It may surprise those who would discount Smith as an advocate of ruthless individualism that his first major work concentrates on ethics and charity. In fact, while chair at the University of Glasgow, Smith’s lecture subjects, in order of preference, were natural theology, ethics, jurisprudence, and economics, according to John Millar, Smith’s pupil at the time. In The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith wrote: “How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature which interest him in the fortune of others and render their happiness necessary to him though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.”1
At the same time, Smith had a benign view of self-interest, denying that self-love “was a principle which could never be virtuous in any degree.”2 Smith argued that life would be tough if our “affections, which, by the very nature of our being, ought frequently to influence our conduct, could upon no occasion appear virtuous, or deserve esteem and commendation from anybody.”3
Smith did not view sympathy and self-interest as antithetical; they were complementary. “Man has almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren, and it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only,” he explained in The Wealth of Nations.4
Charity, while a virtuous act, cannot alone provide the essentials for living. Self-interest is the mechanism that can remedy this shortcoming. Said Smith: “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we can expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest” (ibid.).
Someone earning money by his own labor benefits himself. Unknowingly, he also benefits society, because to earn income on his labor in a competitive market, he must produce something others value. In Adam Smith’s lasting imagery, “By directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.”5
The Wealth of Nations, published as a five-book series, sought to reveal the nature and cause of a nation’s prosperity. Smith saw the main cause of prosperity as increasing division of labor. Using the famous example of pins, Smith asserted that ten workers could produce 48,000 pins per day if each of eighteen specialized tasks was assigned to particular workers. Average productivity: 4,800 pins per worker per day. But absent the division of labor, a worker would be lucky to produce even one pin per day.
Just how individuals can best apply their own labor or any other resource is a central subject in the first book of the series. Smith claimed that an individual would invest a resource—for example, land or labor—so as to earn the highest possible return on it. Consequently, all uses of the resource must yield an equal rate of return (adjusted for the relative riskiness of each enterprise). Otherwise reallocation would result. George Stigler called this idea the central proposition of economic theory. Not surprisingly, and consistent with another Stigler claim that the originator of an idea in economics almost never gets the credit, Smith’s idea was not original. The French economist turgot had made the same point in 1766.
Smith used this insight on equality of returns to explain why wage rates differed. Wage rates would be higher, he argued, for trades that were more difficult to learn, because people would not be willing to learn them if they were not compensated by a higher wage. His thought gave rise to the modern notion of human capital. Similarly, wage rates would also be higher for those who engaged in dirty or unsafe occupations (see Job Safety), such as coal mining and butchering; and for those, like the hangman, who performed odious jobs. In short, differences in work were compensated by differences in pay. Modern economists call Smith’s insight the theory of compensating wage differentials.
Smith used numerate economics not just to explain production of pins or differences in pay between butchers and hangmen, but to address some of the most pressing political issues of the day. In the fourth book of The Wealth of Nations—published, remember, in 1776—Smith told Great Britain that its American colonies were not worth the cost of keeping. His reasoning about the excessively high cost of British imperialism is worth repeating, both to show Smith at his numerate best and to show that simple, clear economics can lead to radical conclusions:
A great empire has been established for the sole purpose of raising up a nation of customers who should be obliged to buy from the shops of our different producers all the goods with which these could supply them. For the sake of that little enhancement of price which this monopoly might afford our producers, the home-consumers have been burdened with the whole expense of maintaining and defending that empire. For this purpose, and for this purpose only, in the two last wars, more than a hundred and seventy millions [in pounds] has been contracted over and above all that had been expended for the same purpose in former wars. The interest of this debt alone is not only greater than the whole extraordinary profit, which, it ever could be pretended, was made by the monopoly of the colony trade, but than the whole value of that trade, or than the whole value of the goods, which at an average have been annually exported to the colonies.6
Smith vehemently opposed mercantilism—the practice of artificially maintaining a trade surplus on the erroneous belief that doing so increased wealth. The primary advantage of trade, he argued, was that it opened up new markets for surplus goods and also provided some commodities from abroad at a lower cost than at home. With that, Smith launched a succession of free-trade economists and paved the way for David Ricardo’s and John Stuart Mill’s theories of comparative advantage a generation later.
Adam Smith has sometimes been caricatured as someone who saw no role for government in economic life. In fact, he believed that government had an important role to play. Like most modern believers in free markets, Smith believed that the government should enforce contracts and grant patents and copyrights to encourage inventions and new ideas. He also thought that the government should provide public works, such as roads and bridges, that, he assumed, would not be worthwhile for individuals to provide. Interestingly, though, he wanted the users of such public works to pay in proportion to their use.
Many people believe that Smith favored retaliatory tariffs.  A retaliatory tariff is one levied by, say, the government of country A against imports from country B to retaliate for tariffs levied by the government of country B against imports from country A. It is true that Smith thought they might be justified, but he was fairly skeptical. He argued that causing additional harm to one's own citizens is a high price to pay that tends not to compensate those who were harmed by the foreign tariff while also hurting innocent others who had no role in formulating the tariff policy. He wrote: 
There may be good policy in retaliations of this kind, when there is a probability that they will procure the repeal of the high duties or prohibitions complained of. The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconveniency of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods. To judge whether such retaliations are likely to produce such an effect does not, perhaps, belong so much to the science of a legislator, whose deliberations ought to be governed by general principles which are always the same, as to the skill of that insidious and crafty animal, vulgarly called a statesman or politician, whose councils are directed by the momentary fluctuations of affairs. When there is no probability that any such repeal can be procured, it seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people to do another injury ourselves, not only to those classes, but to almost all the other classes of them. When our neighbours prohibit some manufacture of ours, we generally prohibit, not only the same, for that alone would seldom affect them considerably, but some other manufacture of theirs. This may no doubt give encouragement to some particular class of workmen among ourselves, and by excluding some of their rivals, may enable them to raise their price in the home-market. Those workmen, however, who suffered by our neighbors prohibition will not be benefited by ours. On the contrary, they and almost all the other classes of our citizens will thereby be obliged to pay dearer than before for certain goods. Every such law, therefore, imposes a real tax upon the whole country, not in favour of that particular class of workmen who were injured by our neighbours prohibition, but of some other class. (An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, par. IV.2.39)
Some of Smith’s ideas are testimony to his breadth of imagination. Today, vouchers and school choice programs are touted as the latest reform in public education. But Adam Smith addressed the issue more than two hundred years ago:
Were the students upon such charitable foundations left free to choose what college they liked best, such liberty might contribute to excite some emulation among different colleges. A regulation, on the contrary, which prohibited even the independent members of every particular college from leaving it, and going to any other, without leave first asked and obtained of that which they meant to abandon, would tend very much to extinguish that emulation.7
Smith’s own student days at Oxford (1740–1746), whose professors, he complained, had “given up altogether even the pretense of teaching,” left him with lasting disdain for the universities of Cambridge and Oxford.
Smith’s writings are both an inquiry into the science of economics and a policy guide for realizing the wealth of nations. Smith believed that economic development was best fostered in an environment of free competition that operated in accordance with universal “natural laws.” Because Smith’s was the most systematic and comprehensive study of economics up until that time, his economic thinking became the basis for classical economics. And because more of his ideas have lasted than those of any other economist, some regard Adam Smith as the alpha and the omega of economic science.

Adam Smith (5 June 1723 OS (16 June 1723 NS) – 17 July 1790) was a Scottish moral philosopher and a pioneer of political economy. One of the key figures of the Scottish Enlightenment,[1] Smith is best known for two classic works: The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759), and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). The latter, usually abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics. Smith is cited as the "father of modern economics" and is still among the most influential thinkers in the field of economics today.[2]
Smith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot, John Snell. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at the University of Edinburgh, leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow teaching moral philosophy, and during this time he wrote and published The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day. Smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory. The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirized by Tory writers in the moralizing tradition of William Hogarth and Jonathan Swift. In 2005, The Wealth of Nations was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time.[3] Former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, it is said, used to carry a copy of the book in her handbag.[4]
Smith was born in Kirkcaldy, in the County of Fife, in Scotland. His father, also of the same name, was a Scottish Writer to the Signet (senior solicitor), advocate, and prosecutor (Judge Advocate) and also served as comptroller of the Customs in Kirkcaldy.[5] In 1720 he married Margaret Douglas, daughter of the landed Robert Douglas of Strathendry, also in Fife. His father died two months after he was born, leaving his mother a widow.[6] The date of Smith's baptism into the Church of Scotland at Kirkcaldy was 5 June 1723,[7] and this has often been treated as if it were also his date of birth,[5] which is unknown. Although few events in Smith's early childhood are known, the Scottish journalist John Rae, Smith's biographer, recorded that Smith was abducted by gypsies at the age of three and released when others went to rescue him.[N 1] Smith was close to his mother, who probably encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions.[9] He attended the Burgh School of Kirkcaldy—characterised by Rae as "one of the best secondary schools of Scotland at that period"[8]—from 1729 to 1737, he learned Latin, mathematics, history, and writing.[9]
Smith entered the University of Glasgow when he was fourteen and studied moral philosophy under Francis Hutcheson.[9] Here, Smith developed his passion for liberty, reason, and free speech. In 1740 Smith was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at Balliol College, Oxford, under the Snell Exhibition.[10]
Adam Smith considered the teaching at Glasgow to be far superior to that at Oxford, which he found intellectually stifling.[11] In Book V, Chapter II of The Wealth of Nations, Smith wrote: "In the University of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching." Smith is also reported to have complained to friends that Oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of David Hume's Treatise on Human Nature, and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it.[8][12][13] According to William Robert Scott, "The Oxford of [Smith's] time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework."[14] Nevertheless, Smith took the opportunity while at Oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large Bodleian Library.[15] When Smith was not studying on his own, his time at Oxford was not a happy one, according to his letters.[16] Near the end of his time there, Smith began suffering from shaking fits, probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown.[17] He left Oxford University in 1746, before his scholarship ended.[17][18]
In Book V of The Wealth of Nations, Smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at English universities, when compared to their Scottish counterparts. He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished men of letters could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the Church of England.[13]
Adam Smith's discontent at Oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in Glasgow, Francis Hutcheson. Hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations (which he sometimes opened to the public). His lectures endeavored not merely to teach philosophy but to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives, appropriately acquiring the epithet, the preacher of philosophy. Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as "the never to be forgotten Hutcheson" – a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend David Hume and influential mentor Francis Hutcheson.[19]
Smith began delivering public lectures in 1748 in University of Edinburgh, sponsored by the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh under the patronage of Lord Kames.[20] His lecture topics included rhetoric and belles-lettres,[21] and later the subject of "the progress of opulence". On this latter topic he first expounded his economic philosophy of "the obvious and simple system of natural liberty". While Smith was not adept at public speaking, his lectures met with success.[22]
In 1750, he met the philosopher David Hume, who was his senior by more than a decade. In their writings covering history, politics, philosophy, economics, and religion, Smith and Hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the Scottish Enlightenment.[23]
In 1751, Smith earned a professorship at Glasgow University teaching logic courses, and in 1752 Smith was elected a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, having been introduced to the society by Lord Kames. When the head of Moral Philosophy died the next year, Smith took over the position.[22] He worked as an academic for the next thirteen years, which he characterized as "by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period [of his life]".[24]
Smith published The Theory of Moral Sentiments in 1759, embodying some of his Glasgow lectures. This work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator, or the individual and other members of society. Smith defined "mutual sympathy" as the basis of moral sentiments. He based his explanation, not on a special "moral sense" as the Third Lord Shaftesbury and Hutcheson had done, nor on utility as Hume did, but on mutual sympathy, a term best captured in modern parlance by the twentieth-century concept of empathy, the capacity to recognize feelings that are being experienced by another being.
Following the publication of The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Smith.[25] After the publication of The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith began to give more attention to jurisprudence and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals.[26] For example, Smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labor, rather than the nation's quantity of gold or silver, which is the basis for mercantilism, the economic theory that dominated Western European economic policies at the time.[25]
In 1762, the University of Glasgow conferred on Smith the title of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.). At the end of 1763, he obtained an offer from Charles Townshend – who had been introduced to Smith by David Hume – to tutor his stepson, Henry Scott, the young Duke of Buccleuch. Smith then resigned from his professorship to take the tutoring position, and he subsequently attempted to return the fees he had collected from his students because he resigned in the middle of the term, but his students refused.[27]
Smith's tutoring job entailed touring Europe with Scott, during which time he educated Scott on a variety of subjects – such as proper Polish.[27] He was paid £300 per year (plus expenses) along with a £300 per year pension; roughly twice his former income as a teacher.[27] Smith first travelled as a tutor to Toulouse, France, where he stayed for one and a half years.[27] According to his own account, he found Toulouse to be somewhat boring, having written to Hume that he "had begun to write a book to pass away the time".[27] After touring the south of France, the group moved to Geneva, where Smith met with the philosopher Voltaire.[28]
From Geneva, the party moved to Paris. Here Smith came to know several great intellectual leaders of the time; invariably having an effect on his future works. This list included: Benjamin Franklin,[29] Turgot, Jean D'Alembert, André Morellet, Helvétius, and, notably, François Quesnay, the head of the Physiocratic school.[30] So impressed with his ideas[31] Smith considered dedicating The Wealth of Nations to him – had Quesnay not died beforehand.[32] Physiocrats were opposed to mercantilism, the dominating economic theory of the time. Illustrated in their motto Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui même! (Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself!). They were also known to have declared that only agricultural activity produced real wealth; merchants and industrialists (manufacturers) did not.[29] This however, did not represent their true school of thought, but was a mere "smoke screen" manufactured to hide their actual criticisms of the nobility and church; arguing that they made up the only real clients of merchants.[33] The wealth of France was virtually destroyed by Louis XIV and Louis XV to ruinous wars,[34] by aiding the American insurgents against the British, and perhaps most destructive (in terms of public perceptions) was what was seen as the excessive consumption of goods and services deemed to have no economic contribution – unproductive labour. Assuming that nobility and church are essentially detractors from economic growth, the feudal system of agriculture in France was the only sector important to maintain the wealth of the nation. Given that the English economy of the day yielded an income distribution that stood in contrast to that which existed in France, Smith concluded that the teachings and beliefs of Physiocrats were, "with all [their] imperfections [perhaps], the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy".[35] The distinction between productive versus unproductive labour – the physiocratic classe steril – was a predominant issue in the development and understanding of what would become classical economic theory.
In 1766, Henry Scott's younger brother died in Paris, and Smith's tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter.[29] Smith returned home that year to Kirkcaldy, and he devoted much of the next ten years to his magnum opus.[36] There he befriended Henry Moyes, a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude. As well as teaching Moyes, Smith secured the patronage of David Hume and Thomas Reid in the young man's education.[37] In May 1773, Smith was elected fellow of the Royal Society of London,[38] and was elected a member of the Literary Club in 1775.[39] The Wealth of Nations was published in 1776 and was an instant success, selling out its first edition in only six months.[40]
In 1778, Smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in Scotland and went to live with his mother in Panmure House in Edinburgh's Canongate.[41] Five years later, as a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh when it received its royal charter, he automatically became one of the founding members of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,[42] and from 1787 to 1789 he occupied the honorary position of Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow.[43] He died in the northern wing of Panmure House in Edinburgh on 17 July 1790 after a painful illness and was buried in the Canongate Kirkyard.[44] On his death bed, Smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more.[45]
Smith's literary executors were two friends from the Scottish academic world: the physicist and chemist Joseph Black, and the pioneering geologist James Hutton.[46] Smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material, but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication.[47] He mentioned an early unpublished History of Astronomy as probably suitable, and it duly appeared in 1795, along with other material such as Essays on Philosophical Subjects.[46]
Smith's library went by his will to David Douglas, Lord Reston (son of his cousin Colonel Robert Douglas of Strathendry, Fife), who lived with Smith. It was eventually divided between his two surviving children, Cecilia Margaret (Mrs. Cunningham) and David Anne (Mrs. Bannerman). On the death of her husband, the Rev. W. B. Cunningham of Prestonpans in 1878, Mrs. Cunningham sold some of the books. The remainder passed to her son, Professor Robert Oliver Cunningham of Queen's College, Belfast, who presented a part to the library of Queen's College. After his death the remaining books were sold. On the death of Mrs. Bannerman in 1879 her portion of the library went intact to the New College (of the Free Church), Edinburgh.
James Tassie's enamel paste medallion of Smith provided the model for many engravings and portraits that remain today.[48]
Not much is known about Smith's personal views beyond what can be deduced from his published articles. His personal papers were destroyed after his death at his request.[47] He never married,[49] and seems to have maintained a close relationship with his mother, with whom he lived after his return from France and who died six years before his own death.[50]
Smith was described by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absent-minded, with peculiar habits of speech and gait, and a smile of "inexpressible benignity".[51] He was known to talk to himself,[45] a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions.[52] He also had occasional spells of imaginary illness,[45] and he is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study.[52] According to one story, Smith took Charles Townshend on a tour of a tanning factory, and while discussing free trade, Smith walked into a huge tanning pit from which he needed help to escape.[53] He is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot, drunk the concoction, and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had. According to another account, Smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up 15 miles (24 km) outside of town, before nearby church bells brought him back to reality.[52][53]
James Boswell who was a student of Smith's at Glasgow University, and later knew him at the Literary Club, says that Smith thought that speaking about his ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of his books, and so his conversation was unimpressive. According to Boswell, he once told Sir Joshua Reynolds that 'he made it a rule when in company never to talk of what he understood'.[54]
Smith, who is reported to have been an odd-looking fellow, has been described as someone who "had a large nose, bulging eyes, a protruding lower lip, a nervous twitch, and a speech impediment".[13] Smith is said to have acknowledged his looks at one point, saying, "I am a beau in nothing but my books."[13] Smith rarely sat for portraits,[55] so almost all depictions of him created during his lifetime were drawn from memory. The best-known portraits of Smith are the profile by James Tassie and two etchings by John Kay.[56] The line engravings produced for the covers of 19th century reprints of The Wealth of Nations were based largely on Tassie's medallion.[57]
There has been considerable scholarly debate about the nature of Smith's religious views. Smith's father had shown a strong interest in Christianity and belonged to the moderate wing of the Church of Scotland.[58] The fact that Adam Smith received the Snell Exhibition suggests that he may have gone to Oxford with the intention of pursuing a career in the Church of England.[59]
Anglo-American economist Ronald Coase has challenged the view that Smith was a deist, based on the fact that Smith's writings never explicitly invoke God as an explanation of the harmonies of the natural or the human worlds.[60] According to Coase, though Smith does sometimes refer to the "Great Architect of the Universe", later scholars such as Jacob Viner have "very much exaggerated the extent to which Adam Smith was committed to a belief in a personal God",[61] a belief for which Coase finds little evidence in passages such as the one in the Wealth of Nations in which Smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the "great phenomena of nature", such as "the generation, the life, growth and dissolution of plants and animals", has led men to "enquire into their causes", and that "superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods. Philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them, from more familiar causes, or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods".[61]
Some other authors argue that Smith's social and economic philosophy is inherently theological and that his entire model of social order is logically dependent on the notion of God's action in nature.[62]
Smith was also a close friend and later the executor of David Hume, who was commonly characterized in his own time as an atheist.[63] The publication in 1777 of Smith's letter to William Strahan, in which he described Hume's courage in the face of death in spite his irreligiosity, attracted considerable controversy.[64]
In 1759, Smith published his first work, The Theory of Moral Sentiments. He continued making extensive revisions to the book, up until his death.[N 2] Although The Wealth of Nations is widely regarded as Smith's most influential work, it is believed that Smith himself considered The Theory of Moral Sentiments to be a superior work.[66]
In the work, Smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time, and suggests that conscience arises from social relationships.[67] His goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankind's ability to form moral judgements, in spite of man's natural inclinations towards self-interest. Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others makes people aware of themselves and the morality of their own behavior.[68]
Scholars have traditionally perceived a conflict between The Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations; the former emphasizes sympathy for others, while the latter focuses on the role of self-interest.[69] In recent years, however, some scholars[70][71][72] of Smith's work have argued that no contradiction exists.[73] They claim that in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the "impartial spectator" as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathize with them. Rather than viewing The Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations as presenting incompatible views of human nature, some Smith scholars regard the works as emphasizing different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation. Furthermore, Ekelund and Hebert argue that self-interest is present in both works and that "in the former, sympathy is the moral faculty that holds self-interest in check, whereas in the latter, competition is the economic faculty that restrains self-interest."[74]
There is a fundamental disagreement between classical and neoclassical economists about the central message of Smith's most influential work: An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Neoclassical economists emphasise Smith's invisible hand,[75] a concept mentioned in the middle of his work – Book IV, Chapter II – and classical economists believe that Smith stated his programme for promoting the "wealth of nations" in the first sentences.
Smith used the term "the invisible hand" in "History of Astronomy"[76] referring to "the invisible hand of Jupiter" and twice – each time with a different meaning – the term "an invisible hand": in The Theory of Moral Sentiments[77] (1759) and in The Wealth of Nations[78] (1776). This last statement about "an invisible hand" has been interpreted as "the invisible hand" in numerous ways. It is therefore important to read the original:
As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.
It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.
Smith's statement about the benefits of "an invisible hand" is certainly meant to answer[citation needed] Mandeville's contention that "Private Vices ... may be turned into Public Benefits".[80] It shows Smith's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest, he indirectly promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their "conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices".[81] Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or monopolies, fixing the highest price "which can be squeezed out of the buyers".[82] Smith also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation. Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants "...in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public...The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention."[83]
The neoclassical interest in Smith's statement about "an invisible hand" originates in the possibility to see it as a precursor of neoclassical economics and its General Equilibrium concept. Samuelson's "Economics" refers 6 times to Smith's "invisible hand". To emphasize this relation, Samuelson[84] quotes Smith's "invisible hand" statement putting "general interest" where Smith wrote "public interest". Samuelson[85] concluded: "Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market."
Very differently, classical economists see in Smith's first sentences his programme to promote "The Wealth of Nations". Taking up the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process means that to have growth the inputs of period2 must excel the inputs of period1. Therefore the outputs of period1 not used or usable as input of period2 are regarded as unproductive labour as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had learned in France with Quesnay. To this French insight that unproductive labour should be pushed back to use more labour productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the division of labour. Deepening the division of labour means under competition lower prices and thereby extended markets. Extended markets and increased production lead to a new step of reorganising production and inventing new ways of producing which again lower prices, etc., etc.. Smith's central message is therefore that under dynamic competition a growth machine secures "The Wealth of Nations". It predicted England's evolution as the workshop of the World, underselling all its competitors. The opening sentences of the "Wealth of Nations" summarize this policy:
The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes ... . [T]his produce ... bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it ... .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;
secondly, by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed [emphasis added].[86]
Alfred Marshall criticized Smith's definition of economy on several points. He argued that man should be equally important as money, services are as important as goods, and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare, instead of just wealth.
Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph E. Stiglitz says, on the topic of one of Smith's better known ideas: "the reason that the invisible hand often seems invisible is that it is often not there."[87]
Shortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published Essays on Philosophical Subjects, a history of astronomy down to Smith's own era, plus some thoughts on ancient physics and metaphysics, probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. Lectures on Jurisprudence were notes taken from Smith's early lectures, plus an early draft of The Wealth of Nations, published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms (1763) (first published in 1896); and Essays on Philosophical Subjects (1795).[88]
The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirized by Tory writers in the moralizing tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests.[89] In 2005, The Wealth of Nations was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time.[3] Former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, it is said, used to carry a copy of the book in her handbag.[90]
In light of the arguments put forward by Smith and other economic theorists in Britain, academic belief in mercantalism began to decline in England in the late 18th century. During the Industrial Revolution, Britain embraced free trade and Smith's laissez-faire economics, and via the British Empire, used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world, characterized by open markets, and relatively barrier free domestic and international trade.[91]
George Stigler attributes to Smith "the most important substantive proposition in all of economics". It is that, under competition, owners of resources (for example labor, land, and capital) will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in equilibrium for all uses, adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment.[92]
Paul Samuelson finds in Smith's pluralist use of supply and demand as applied to wages, rents, profit a valid and valuable anticipation of the general equilibrium modeling of Walras a century later. Smith's allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention contrasted with Malthus, Ricardo, and Karl Marx in their propounding a rigid subsistence–wage theory of labour supply.[93]
On the other hand, Joseph Schumpeter dismissed Smith's contributions as unoriginal, saying "His very limitation made for success. Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along."[94]
Classical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith, termed the "labour theory of value". Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith's labour theories, in part. The first volume of Karl Marx's major work, Capital, was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital.[95][96] The labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labor that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern contention of neoclassical economics, that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.
The body of theory later termed "neoclassical economics" or "marginalism" formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term "economics" was popularized by such neoclassical economists as Alfred Marshall as a concise synonym for "economic science" and a substitute for the earlier, broader term "political economy" used by Smith.[97][98] This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the natural sciences.[99] Neoclassical economics systematized supply and demand as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the labour theory of value of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.[100]
The bicentennial anniversary of the publication of The Wealth of Nations was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for The Theory of Moral Sentiments and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both The Wealth of Nations and The Theory of Moral Sentiments, and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His homo economicus or "economic man" was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, economists David Levy and Sandra Peart in "The Secret History of the Dismal Science" point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality, and provide additional support for those who point to Smith's opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire.[101] They show the caricatures of Smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article. Emphasized also are Smith's statements of the need for high wages for the poor, and the efforts to keep wages low. In The “Vanity of the Philosopher”: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics Peart and Levy also cite Smith's view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher,[102] and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical. They also cite Smith's opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense.[103]
"Men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all." (Source: The Wealth of Nations, Book 5, Chapter 1, Part 2)
A statue of Smith in Edinburgh's High Street, erected through private donations organised by the Adam Smith Institute.
Smith has been commemorated in the UK on banknotes printed by two different banks; his portrait has appeared since 1981 on the £50 notes issued by the Clydesdale Bank in Scotland,[104][105] and in March 2007 Smith's image also appeared on the new series of £20 notes issued by the Bank of England, making him the first Scotsman to feature on an English banknote.[106]
Statue of Smith built in 1867-1870 at the old headquarters of the University of London, 6 Burlington Gardens.
A large-scale memorial of Smith by Alexander Stoddart was unveiled on 4 July 2008 in Edinburgh. It is a 10 feet (3.0 m)-tall bronze sculpture and it stands above the Royal Mile outside St Giles' Cathedral in Parliament Square, near the Mercat cross.[107] 20th-century sculptor Jim Sanborn (best known for the Kryptos sculpture at the United States Central Intelligence Agency) has created multiple pieces which feature Smith's work. At Central Connecticut State University is Circulating Capital, a tall cylinder which features an extract from The Wealth of Nations on the lower half, and on the upper half, some of the same text but represented in binary code.[108] At the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, outside the Belk College of Business Administration, is Adam Smith's Spinning Top.[109][110] Another Smith sculpture is at Cleveland State University.[111] He also appears as the narrator in the 2013 play The Low Road, centred on a proponent on laissez-faire economics in the late eighteenth century but dealing obliquely with the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the recession which followed – in the premiere production, he was portrayed by Bill Paterson.
Adam Smith resided at Panmure house from 1778–90. This residence has now been purchased by the Edinburgh Business School at Heriot Watt University and fundraising has begun to restore it.[112][113] Part of the Northern end of the original building appears to have been demolished in the 19th century to make way for an iron foundry.
Smith has been celebrated by advocates of free market policies as the founder of free market economics, a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the Adam Smith Institute in London, the Adam Smith Society[114] and the Australian Adam Smith Club,[115] and in terms such as the Adam Smith necktie.[116]
Alan Greenspan argues that, while Smith did not coin the term laissez-faire, "it was left to Adam Smith to identify the more-general set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions". Greenspan continues that The Wealth of Nations was "one of the great achievements in human intellectual history".[117] P. J. O'Rourke describes Smith as the "founder of free market economics".[118]
However, other writers have argued that Smith's support for laissez-faire (which in French means leave alone) has been overstated. Herbert Stein wrote that the people who "wear an Adam Smith necktie" do it to "make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and limited government", and that this misrepresents Smith's ideas. Stein writes that Smith "was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie." In Stein's reading, The Wealth of Nations could justify the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and "discriminatory taxation to deter improper or luxurious behavior".[119]
Similarly, Vivienne Brown stated in The Economic Journal that in the 20th century United States, Reaganomics supporters, the Wall Street Journal, and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Smith, portraying him as an "extreme dogmatic defender of laissez-faire capitalism and supply-side economics".[120] In fact, The Wealth of Nations includes the following statement on the payment of taxes:
"The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state."[121]
Some commentators have argued that Smith's works show support for a progressive, not flat, income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state, among them luxury goods taxes and tax on rent.[122]
Additionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defense and regulate banking. It was the role of the government to provide goods "of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual" such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. he supported public education and religious institutions as providing general benefit to the society. Finally he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because "we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a doge".[123] In addition, he was in favor of retaliatory tariffs and believed that they would eventually bring down the price of goods. He even stated in Wealth of Nations:
"The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods."[124]
Economic historians such as Jacob Viner regard Smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Smith called "natural liberty") but not as a dogmatic supporter of laissez-faire.[125]
Economist Daniel Klein believes using the term "free market economics" or "free market economist" to identify the ideas of Smith is too general and slightly misleading. Klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of Smith's economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the "Smithian" identity.[126][127] Economist David Ricardo set straight some of the misunderstandings about Smith's thoughts on free market. Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood it would be unwilling to surrender the government help.[128] Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defense.[128] Some have also claimed, Emma Rothschild among them, that Smith supported a minimum wage.[129]
"The price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so." (Source: The Wealth of Nations, Book 1, Chapter 8)
A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him; but the necessity is not so immediate.

Adam Smith was born in Kirkcaldy Scotland in 1723.  When he was 17 years old he went to Oxford and in 1951 he became a professor of Logic at Glasgow.  The next year he took the Chair of Moral Philosophy. In 1759, he published his Theory of Moral Sentiments.  It 1776 he published his masterpiece: An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.  After living in both France and London Adam Smith returned to Scotland in 1778 when he was appointed commissioner of customs for Edinburgh.  Adam Smith died on July 17th, 1790 in Edinburgh.  He was buried in the Canongate churchyard.
Adam Smith is often described as the "founding father of economics". A great deal of what is now considered standard theory about the theory about markets was developed by Adam Smith.  Two books, Theory of Moral Sentiments and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations are of great importance. 
In Theory of Moral Sentiments Adam Smith developed the foundation for a general system of morals.  It is a very important text in the history of moral and political thought. It provides the ethical, philosophical, psychological and methodological underpinnings to Smith's later works.  In Theory of Moral Sentiment Smith states that man as self-interested and self-commanded.  Individual freedom, according to Smith, is rooted in self reliance, the ability of an individual to pursue his self-interest while commanding himself based on the principles of natural law.
The Wealth of Nations is a five book series and considered to be the first modern work in the field of economics.  Using very detailed examples Adam Smith attempted to reveal the nature and cause of a nation's prosperity. Through his examination he developed a critique of the economic system.  Most commonly known are Smith's critique of mercantilism and his concept of the Invisible Hand.  Adam Smith's arguments are still used and cited today in debates.  Not everyone agrees with Smith's ideas.  Many see Smith as an advocate of ruthless individualism.  Regardless of how Smith's ideas are viewed An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations is considered to be and is arguably the most important book on the subject ever published. Without a doubt, it is the most seminal text in the field of free-market capitalism.

Smith was a hugely influential Scottish political economist and philosopher, best known for his book 'The Wealth of Nations'.
Adam Smith's exact date of birth is unknown, but he was baptised on 5 June 1723. His father, a customs officer in Kirkcaldy, died before he was born. He studied at Glasgow and Oxford Universities. He returned to Kircaldy in 1746 and two years later he was asked to give a series of public lectures in Edinburgh, which established his reputation.
In 1751, Smith was appointed professor of logic at Glasgow University and a year later professor of moral philosophy. He became part of a brilliant intellectual circle that included David Hume, John Home, Lord Hailes and William Robertson. 
In 1764, Smith left Glasgow to travel on the Continent as a tutor to Henry, the future Duke of Buccleuch. While travelling, Smith met a number of leading European intellectuals including Voltaire, Rousseau and Quesnay. 
In 1776, Smith moved to London. He published a volume which he intended to be the first part of a complete theory of society, covering theology, ethics, politics and law. This volume, 'Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations', was the first major work of political economy. Smith argued forcefully against the regulation of commerce and trade, and wrote that if people were set free to better themselves, it would produce economic prosperity for all.
In 1778, Smith was appointed commissioner of customs in Edinburgh. In 1783, he became a founding member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He died in the city on 17 July 1790.

=======================================================
The fame of Adam Smith rests so deservedly on his great work, the Wealth of Nations, that the fact is apt to be lost sight of,
that long before he distinguished himself as a political economist he had gained a reputation, not confined to his own
country, by his speculations in moral philosophy. The Theory of Moral Sentiments was first published in 1759, when its
author was thirty-six; the Wealth of Nations in 1776, when he was fifty-three. The success of the latter soon eclipsed that of
his first work, but the wide celebrity which soon attended the former is attested by the fact of. the sort of competition that
ensued for translating it into French. Rochefoucauld, grandson of the famous author of the Maxims, got so far in a
translation of it as the end of the first Part, when a complete translation by the Abbé Blavet compelled him to renounce the
continuance of his work. The Abbé Morelletso conspicuous a figure in the French literature of that periodspeaks of himself
in his Memoirs as having been impressed by Adam Smith's Theory with a great idea of its author's wisdom and depth of
The publication of these two books, the only writings published by their author in his lifetime, are strictly speaking the only
episodes which form anything like landmarks in Adam Smith's career. The sixty-seven years of his life (1723-90) were in
other respects strangely destitute of what are called "events;" and beyond the adventure of his childhood, when he was
carried away by gipsies but soon rescued, nothing extraordinary ever occurred to ruffle the even surface of his existence. 
If, therefore, the happiness of an individual, like that of a nation, may be taken to vary inversely with the materials afforded
by them to the biographer or the historian, Adam Smith may be considered to have attained no mean degree of human
felicity. From his ideal of life, political ambition and greatness were altogether excluded; it was his creed that happiness was
equal in every lot, and that contentment alone was necessary to ensure it. "What," he asks, "can be added to the happiness of
To this simple standard, circumstances assisted him to mould his life. His health, delicate in his early years, became stronger
with age; necessity never compelled him to seek a competence in uncongenial pursuits; nor did a tranquil life of learning ever
tempt him into paths at variance with the laws of his moral being or his country. In several passages of his Moral
Sentiments, it will appear that he took no pains to conceal his preference for the old Epicurean theory of life, that in ease of
But the charm of such a formula of life is perhaps more obvious than its rendering into an actual state of existence. Ease of
body does not always come for the wishing; and peace of mind often lies still further from command. The advantage of the
formula is, that it sets before us a definite aim, and affords us at any time a measure of the happiness we enjoy or of that we
see around us. Judged by this standard, however, the conclusion must beand it is a conclusion from which Adam Smith
The result of this Epicurean theory of life on Adam Smith was, fortunately for the world, a strong preference for the life of
learning and literature over the professional or political life. He abjured from the first all anxiety for the prizes held out by
the various professions to candidates for wealth or reputation. Though sent to Balliol at seventeen as a Snell exhibitioner,
for the purpose of fitting himself for service in the Church of England, he preferred so much the peace of his own mind to
the wishes of his friends and relations, that, when he left Oxford after a residence of seven years, he declined to enter into
the ecclesiastical profession at all, and he returned to Scotland with the sole and simple hope of obtaining through literature
Fortune seems to have favoured him in making such a course possible, for after leaving Oxford he spent two years at home
with his mother at Kirkaldy. He had not to encounter the difficulties which compelled Hume to practise frugality abroad, in
order to preserve his independence. His father, who had died a few months before his birth, had been private secretary to the
Principal Secretary of State for Scotland, and after that Comptroller of the Customs at Kirkaldy. Adam Smith was,
moreover, an only child, and if there was not wealth at home, there was the competence which was all he desired. 
By the circumstances of his birth, his education, like that of David Hume, devolved in his early years upon his mother, of
whom one would gladly know more than has been vouchsafed by her son's biographer. She is said to have been blamed for
spoiling him, but it is possible that what seemed to her Scotch neighbours excessive indulgence meant no very exceptional
degree of kindness. At all events, the treatment succeeded, nor had ever a mother a more devoted son. Her death, which did
not long precede his own, closed a life of unremitted affection on both sides, and was the first and greatest bereavement that
Adam Smith ever had to mourn. The society of his mother and her niece, Miss Douglas, who lived with them, was all that he
ever knew of family life; and when the small circle broke up, as it did at last speedily and with short intervals of survival for
those who experienced the grief of the first sepa- ration, Adam Smith was well-advanced in years. He survived his mother
It is said, that after a disappointment in early life, Adam Smith gave up all thoughts of marriage; but if he thus failed of the
happiest condition of life, it is equally true that he was spared the greatest sorrows of human existence, and a number of
minor troubles and anxieties. The domestic economy was entirely conducted by his cousin, and to the philosopher is
attributed with more than usual justice all that incapacity for the common details of life with which the popular conception
always clothes a scholar. It is said that even the fancy of a La Bruyère has scarcely imagined instances of a more striking
absence of mind than might be actually quoted of him;(2) and from boyhood upwards he' had the habit of laughing and talking
Dugald Stewart, whose somewhat meagre memoir on Adam Smith is the chief authority for all that is known of his life,
describes him as "certainly not fitted for the general commerce of the world or for the business of active life." The subject of
his studies rendered him "habitually inattentive to familiar objects and to common occurrences." Even in company, he was
apt to be engrossed with his studies, and would seem, by the motion of his lips as well as by his looks and gestures, to be in
all the fervour of composition. In conversation "he was scarcely ever known to start a topic himself," and if he did succeed
in falling in with the common dialogue of conversation, "he was somewhat apt to convey his own ideas in the form of a
lecture." Notwithstanding these defects, we are told of "the splendour of his conversation," and of the inexhaustible novelty
and variety which belonged to it, by reason of his ready adaptation of fanciful theories to all the common topics of discourse. 
Of his early yearsoften the most interesting of any, as indicative of future charactersingularly little remains known. Some
of those who were the companions of his first school years at Kirkaldy, and who remained his friends for life, have attested
At the age of fourteen he was sent to the University of Glasgow, where his favourite studies were mathematics and natural
sciences, and where he attended the lectures of Dr. Hutcheson, who has been called "the father of speculative philosophy in
Scotland in modern times," and whose theory of the Moral Sense had so much influence on Adam Smith's own later ethical
Beyond this reference to his studies, nothing is told of Adam Smith's three years at Glasgow. His whole youth is in fact a
blank for his biographer. We hear of no prizes, no distinctions, no friendships, no adventures, no eccentricities of any kind.
Nor is it much better with regard to his career at Oxford, to which he was sent by the University of Glasgow at the age of
seventeen. Only one anecdote remains, of very doubtful truth, and not mentioned by Dugald Stewart, to the effect that he
once incurred rebuke from the college authorities of Balliol for having been detected in his rooms reading Hume's Treatise
on Human Nature. The story is worth mentioning, if only as an indication of the prevalent idea of Adam Smith's bent of
mind in his undergraduate days; and those who, in spite of experience, still hold to the theory, that at the bottom of every
story some truth must lie, may gather from this one, that even at college the future friend of the historian was attracted by
It was perhaps by reason of this attraction that at the end of seven years at Oxford Adam Smith declined to take orders.
Leaving Oxford, which for most men means an entire change of life, meant for him simply a change in the scene of his
studies; a transfer of them from one place to another. Languages, literature, and history, could, he found, be studied as well
at Kirkaldy as at the chief seat of learning in England. To Oxford, so different in most colleges now from what it was in
those days, he seems never to have expressed or felt the gratitude which through life attached him to Glasgow; and his
impressions of the English university have been immortalized by him in no flattering terms in what he has said of it in his
After nearly two years spent at home, Adam Smith removed to Edinburgh, where, under the patronage of Lord Kames, so
well known in connexion with the Scotch literature of the last century, he delivered lectures on rhetoric and belles lettres;
and the same subject formed the greater part of his lectures as Professor of Logic at Glasgow, to which post he was elected
in 1751, at the age of twenty-eight. The next year he was chosen Professor of Moral Philosophy at the same university; and
the period of thirteen years, during which he held this situation, he ever regarded as the most useful and happy of his life. 
Of his lectures at Glasgow only so much has been preserved as he published in the Moral Sentiments and Wealth of Nations
respectively. He divided his course into four parts, the first relating to Natural Theology, the second to Ethics, the third to
the subject of Justice and the growth of Jurisprudence, the fourth to Politics. Under the latter head he dealt with the political
institutions relating to commerce and all the subjects which enter into his maturer work on the Nature and Causes of the
Wealth of Nations; whilst under the second head, he expounded the doctrines which he afterwards published in the Moral
Sentiments. On the subject of Justice, it was his intention to write a system of natural jurisprudence, "or a theory of the
general principles which ought to run through and be the foundation of the laws of all nations." It was to have been an
improvement on the work of Grotius on the same subject, and the Theory of Moral Sentiments concludes with a promise
which, unfortunately, was never fulfilled. "I shall," he says, "in another discourse, endeavour to give an account of the
general principles of law and government, and of the different revolutions they have undergone in the different ages and
periods of society, not only in what concerns justice, but in what concerns police, revenue, and arms, and whatever else is
the object of law. I shall not, therefore, at present, enter into any further details concerning the history of jurisprudence.(3) 
One of Adam Smith's own pupils, and afterwards for life one of his most intimate friends, Dr. Millar, professor of law at
Glasgow, and author of an excellent work on the Origin of Ranks, has left a graphic description of the great success which
attended these lectures at Glasgow. "There was no situation in which the abilities of Mr. Smith appeared to greater
advantage than as a professor.... his reputation as a professor was accordingly raised vcry high, and a multitude of students
from a great distance resorted to the University, merely upon his account. Those branches of science which he taught
became fashionable at this place, and his opinions were the chief topic of discussion in clubs and literary societies. Even the
small peculiarities in his pronunciation or manner of speaking, became frequently the objects of imitation." 
It seems to have been during the early years of his professorship at Glasgow that Adam Smith formed that friendship with
David Hume which forms so pleasing a feature in the life of both of them, and is so memorable in the history of literary
attachments. There was sufficient sameness in the fundamental characteristics and opinions of each of them, together with
sufficient differences on minor points, to ensure the permanence of their mutual affection. Both took the same interest in
questions of moral philosophy and political economy; both had a certain simplicity and gentleness of character; both held the
A letter written by Hume to his friend in 1759, on the occasion of the publication of his Moral Sentiments, is of interest, not
only as characteristic of the friendship between them, but as indicative of the good reception which the book immediately
"I give you thanks for the agreeable present of your Theory. Wedderburne and I made presents of our copies to such of our
acquaintances as we thought good judges, and proper to spread the reputation of the book. I sent one to the Duke of Argyll,
to Lord Lyttleton, Horace Walpole, Soame Jennyns, and Burke, an Irish gentleman, who wrote lately a very pretty treatise
on the Sublime. Millar desired my permission to send one in your name to Dr. Warburton. I have delayed writing till I could
tell you something of the success of the book, and could prognosticate, with some probability, whether it should be finally
damned to oblivion, or should be registered in the temple of immortality. Though it has been published only a few weeks, I
think there appear already such strong symptoms, that I can almost venture to foretell its fate....  I am afraid of Lord
Kames's Law Tracts. A man might as well think of making a fine sauce by a mixture of wormwood and aloes as an agreeable
composition by joining metaphysics and Scotch law.... I believe I have mentioned to you already Helvetius's book de
l'Esprit. It is worth your reading, not for its philosophy, which I do not highly value, but for its agreeable composition. I had
a letter from him a few days ago wherein he tells me that my name was much oftener in the manuscript, but that the censor
of books at Paris obliged him to strike it out.... But what is all this to my book? say you. My dear Mr. Smith, have patience:
compose yourself to tranquillity; show yourself a philosopher in practice as well as profession; think on the emptiness, and
rashness, and futility of the common judgment of men; how little they are regulated by reason in any subject, much more in
philosophical subjects, which so far exceed the comprehension of the vulgar. ... A wise man's kingdom is his own breast; or,
if he ever looks farther, it will only be to the judgment of a select few, who are free from prejudices and capable of
examining his work. Nothing indeed can be a stronger presumption of falsehood than the approbation of the multitude; and
Phocion, you know, always suspected himself of some blunder when he was attended with the applauses of the populace. 
"Supposing. there fore, that you have duly prepared yourself for the worst by all these reflections, I proceed to tell you the
melancholy news, that your book has been very unfortunate, for the public seem disposed to applaud it extremely. It was
looked for by the foolish people with some impatience; and the mob of literati are beginning already to be very loud in its
praises. Three bishops called yesterday at Millar's shop in order to buy copies and to ask questions about its author. The
Bishop of Peterborough said he had passed the evening in a company where he heard it extolled above all books in the
world. The Duke of Argyll is more decisive than he uses to be in its favour. I suppose he either considers it an exotic or
thinks the author will be serviceable to him in the Glasgow elections. Lord Lyttleton says that Robertson, and Smith, and
Bower are the glories of English literature. Oswald protests he does not know whether he has reaped more instruction or
entertainment from it. But you may easily judge what reliance can be placed on his judgment who has been engaged all his
life in public business, and who never sees any faults in his friends. Millar exults and brags that two-thirds of the edition are
already sold, and that it is sure of success. You see what a son of earth that is, to value books only by the profit they bring
"Charles Townsend, who passes for the cleverest fellow in England, is so taken with the performance that he said to Oswald
he would put the Duke of Buccleuch under the author's care, and would make it worth his while to accept of that charge. As
soon as I heard this I called on him twice, with a view of talking with him about the matter, and of convincing him of the
propriety of sending that young nobleman to Glasgow; for I could not hope that he could offer you any terms which would
"In recompense for so many mortifying things, which nothing but truth could have extorted from me, and which I could
easily have multiplied to a greater number, I doubt not but you are so good a Christian as to return good for evil; and to
flatter my vanity by telling me that all the godly in Scotland abuse me for my account of John Knox and the Reformation,"
The invitation referred to by Hume in this letter to travel with the Duke of Buecleuch came in about four years time; and the
liberal terms in which the proposal was made, together with the strong temptation to travel, led to a final resignation of the
But here again curiosity is doomed to disappointment; for Adam Smith wrote no journal of his travels abroad, and he had
such an aversion to letter-writing that no records of this sort preserve his impressions of foreign life.(4) Scarcely more than
the bare outline of his route is known. Some two weeks at Paris were followed by eighteen months at Toulouse. Then a tour
in the South of France was followed by two months at Geneva; and from Christmas, 1765, to the following October the
travellers were in Paris, this latter period being the only one of any general interest, on account of the illustrious
During this period Adam Smith became acquainted with the chief men of letters and philosophers of Paris, such as
D'Alemhert, Helvetius, Marmontel, Morellet; and it is to be regretted that Morellet, who mentions the fact of conversations
between himself, Turgot, and Adam Smith, on subjects of political economy and on several points connected with the great
work then contemplated by the latter, should have given us no clue to the influence Turgot may have had in suggesting or
confirming the idea of free trade. That the intercourse between them became intimate may at least be inferred from the
unverified story of their subsequent literary correspondence; and to Quesnai, the economist, it is known that Adam Smith
intended, but for the death of the former, to have dedicated his Wealth of Nations. `With Morellet, too, Adam Smith seems
to have been intimate. The abbé records in his Memoirs that he kept for twenty years a pocket-book presented to him as a
keepsake by Adam Smith. The latter sent him also a copy of the Wealth of Nations ten years later, which Morellet, with his
usual zeal for translating, set to work upon at once. The Abbé Blavet, however, was again the first in the field, so that
Morellet could not find a publisher. It is worth noticing that Morellet mentions the fact that Adam Smith spoke French very
badly, which is not the least inconsistent with his biographer's claim for him of an "uncommonly extensive and accurate
The duke and the philosopher, having laid in their companionship abroad the foundation of a friendship which lasted till the
death of the latter, returned to London in October, 1766. The next ten years of his life Adam Smith spent at home with his
mother and cousin, preparing the work on which his fame now chiefly rests. It was a period of quiet uneventful study, and
almost solitude. Writing to Hume, he says that his chief amusements are long and solitary walks by the sea, and that he never
felt more happy, comfortable, or contented, in his life. Hume made vain endeavours to tempt him to Edinburgh from his
retirement. "I want," he said, "to know what you have been doing, and propose to exact a rigorous account of the method in
which you have employed yourself during your retreat. I am positive you are wrong in many of your speculations, especially
This was in 1769. Seven years later, 1776, the Wealth of Nations appeared, and Hume, who was then dying, again wrote his
friend a congratulatory letter. "Euge! Belle! I am much pleased with your performance, and the perusal of it has taken me
from a great state of anxiety. It was a work of so much expectation, by yourself, by your friends, and by the public, that I
trembled for its appearance; but am now much relieved. Not but that the reading of it necessarily requires so much attention,
that I shall still doubt for some time of its being at first very popular. But it has depth and solidity, and acuteness, and is so
much illustrated by curious facts, that it must, at last, take the public attention. It is probably much improved by your last
abode in London. If you were here, at my fireside, I should dispute some of your principles. . . . But these, and a hundred
other points, are fit only to be discussed in conversation. I hope it will be soon, for I am in a very bad state of health, and
This letter seems to have led to a meeting between the two friends, the last before the sad final separation. Of the
cheerfulness with which Hume met his death, Adam Smith wrote an account in a letter addressed to Strahan, the publisher,
and appended to Hume's autobiography, telling how Hume, in reference to his approaching departure, imagined a
conversation between himself and Charon, and how he continued to correct his works for a new edition, to read books of
amusement, to converse, or sometimes play at whist with his friends. Ho also extolled "Hume's extreme gentleness of nature,
which never weakened the firmness of his mind nor the steadiness of his resolutions; his constant pleasantry and good
humour; his severe application to study, his extensive learning, his depth of Thought. He thought that his temper was more
evenly balanced than in any other man he ever knew; and that, however much difference of opinion there might be among
men as to his philosophical ideas, according as they happened or not to coincide with their own, there could scarcely be any
concerning his character and conduct. "Upon the whole," he concluded, "I have always considered him, both in his lifetime
and since his death, as approaching as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man as perhaps the nature of human
Considering that Hume counted among his friends such churchmen as Robertson the historian, and Blair, author of the
Sermons, Adam Smith's confident belief in the uniformity of judgment about his friend's character need not appear
unreasonable; but, unfortunately, a dignitary of the Church, author of a Commentary on the Psalms, and afterwards Bishop
of Norwich, chose to consider the letter to Strahan a manifesto against Christianity, and accordingly published anonymously
a letter to Adam Smith, purporting to be written "by one of the people called Christians." The writer claimed to have in his
composition a large proportion of the milk of human kindness; to be no bigot nor enemy to human learning; and never to
have known the meaning of envy or hatred. Strange then that, at the age of forty-six, Dr. Home should have been guilty of a
letter, which it would be difficult to match for injustice of inference, or contemptibility of style, and which he even thought
fit to leave to posterity among his other published works. He begins: "You have been lately employed in embalming a
philosopher; his body, I believe I must say, for concerning the other part of his nature neither you nor he seem to have
entertained an idea, sleeping or waking. Else it surely might have claimed a little of your care and attention; and one would
think the belief of the soul's existence and immortality could do no harm, if it did no good, in a Theory of Moral Sentiments.
The letter, pervaded by the same spirit of banter throughout, is too long to quote at length, but the following extracts
contain the leading idea: "Are you sure, and can you make us sure, that there really exist no such things as God, a future
state of rewards and punishments? If so, all is well. Let us then, in our last hours, read Lucian, and play at whist, and droll
upon Charon and his boat; let us die as foolish and insensible, as much like our brother philosophers the calves of the field
and the asses of the desert, as we can, for the life of us. . . . . Upon the whole, doctor, your meaning is good; but I think you
will not succeed this time. You would persuade us, by the example of David Hume, Esq., that atheism is the only cordial for
It is difficult to say whether the puerility or the ignorance displayed in this letter is the greater. Either the writer had never
read the Theory of Moral Sentiments at all, or he was so 1ittle versed in philosophy as to see no difference between Deism
and Atheism, two distinct logical contradictories. There is, moreover, not a word in Adam Smith's letter to justify any
reference to religious questions at all; and sub- sequent quotations from the Moral Sentiments will abundantly demonstrate
the total falsity of the churchman's assumptions. Adam Smith treated his letter with the contemptuous silence it so well
deserved. The story quoted by Sir Walter Scott, in an article in the Quarterly, that Johnson grossly insulted Adam Smith at a
literary meeting in Glasgow, by reason of his dislike for him, as the eulogizer of Hume, is easily shown to rest on no
foundation. Hume did not die till 1776, and it was three years earlier that Johnson visited Glasgow. 
The two years after the publication of his greatest work Adam Smith spent in London, in the midst of that literary society
which we know so well through the pages of Boswell. Then, at the request of the Duke of Buceleuch, he was made one of
the Commissioners of Custom in Scotland, and in this occupation spent the last twelve years of his life, in the midst of a
society which must have formed an agreeable contrast to the long years of his retirement and solitude. The light duties of his
office the pleasures of friendship; the loss of his mother and cousin, and increasing ill health, all combined to prevent the
completion of any more of his literary projects. A few days before his death he ordered all his manuscripts to be burnt, with
the exception of a few essays, which may still be read. They consist of a History of Astronomy, a History of Ancient
Physics, a History of Ancient Logic and Metaphysics, an Essay on the Imitative Arts, on certain English and Italian verses,
and on the External Senses. The destroyed manuscripts are supposed to have comprised the lectures on Rhetoric, read at
Edinburgh forty-two years before, and the lectures on Natural Theology and on Jurisprudence, which formed part of his
lectures at Glasgow. The additions which lie made to the Moral Sentiments, in the last winter of his life, he lived to see
Of the Theory of Moral Sentiments Sir James Mackintosh says: "Perhaps there is no ethical work since Cicero's Offices, of
which an abridgment enables the reader so inadequately to estimate the merit, as the Theory of Moral Sentiments. This is not
chiefly owing to the beauty of diction, as in the case of Cicero, but to the variety of explanations of life and manners which
embellish the book more than they illuminate the theory. Yet, on the other hand, it must be owned that, for philosophical
purposes, few books more need abridgment; for the most careful reader frequently loses sight of principles buried under
illustrations. The naturally copious and flowing style of the author is generally redundant, and the repetition of certain
formularies of the system is, in the later editions, so frequent as to be wearisome, and sometimes ludicrous." 
The justice of this criticism has been the guiding principle in the attempt made in the following chapters to give an account
of Adam Smith's system of moral philosophy, the aim having been to avoid sacrificing the main theory to the
super-abundance of illustration which somewhat obscures it in the original, while at the same time doing justice to the minor
subjects treated of, which, though they have little or nothing to do with Adam Smith's leading principles, yet form a
distinctive feature in his work, and are in many respects the most interesting part of it; for critics who have rejected the
Theory as a whole, have been uniformly loud in their praises of its minor details and illustrations. Brown, for instance, who
has been the most successful perhaps of all the adverse critics of the Theory, speaks of it as presenting in these respects "a
model of philosophic beauty." Jouffroy, too, allows that the book is one of the most useful in moral science, because Adam
Smith, "deceived as he undoubtedly was as to the principle of morality," brought to light and analyzed so many of the facts
of human nature. Dugald Stewart and Mackintosh both say much the same thing; so that it is evident no account of Adam
Smith's work can be complete which omits from consideration all the collateral inquiries he pursues or all the illustrations he
draws, either from history or from his imagination. To preserve, as far as possible, the proportion which these collateral
inquiries bear to one another and to the main theory, as well as to retain what is most characteristic of the original in point of
illustration and style, having been therefore the end in view, it has been found best to alter the arrangement in some degree,
and to divide the whole into chapters, the relations of which to the divisions of the original will be best understood by a brief
Of the Foundation of our judgments concerning our own Sentiments and Conduct, and of the Sense of Duty. 
V. Of the influence of Custom and Fashion upon the sentiments of Moral Approbation and Disapprobation. 
The excellence of this arrangement, however, is considerably marred by the division of these Parts into Sections, and by the
frequent further subdivison of the Sections themselves into Chapters. An instance will illustrate how detrimental this is to the
clearness of the main argument. The first three Parts exhaust the main theory, or that doctrine of Sympathy, which is Adam
Smith's own special creation, and on which his rank as a moral philosopher depends; the other four Parts having only to do
with it incidentally or by accident. But in following the first three Parts in which the doctrine of Sympathy is expounded, we
come across sections which also are only connected incidentally with the leading argument, and are really branches off the
main line. Thus in the Part devoted to the explanation of our ideas of Propriety in Action there occurs a section on the effect
of prosperity or adversity in influencing our judgment; in the Part treating of Merit and Demerit there is a section on the
influence of fortune or accident on our sentiments of men's merit or the contrary; and there is, lastly, a distinct Part (Part V.)
allotted to the consideration of the influence of Custom and Fashion on our sentiments of moral approbation or
disapprobation. These subjects are obviously so nearly allied, that they might all have been treated together, apart from the
doctrine of sympathy of which they are quite independent; and accordingly in the sequel the dissertations concerning them in
the original are collected into a single chapter, the fifth, on the influence of Prosperity and Adversity, Chance and Custom,
Consistently with the principles already explained, the order of the original has been followed as closely as possible. The
second, third, and fourth chapters comprise Parts I. and II. Part V., and the sections relating to the same subject in Parts I.
and II., make up the fifth chapter. Then Part III. is divided for clearness' sake into two chapters, explaining the author's
Theory of Conscience and Theory of Moral Principles; and the end of these two chapters, the sixth and seventh, concludes
Part VI., on the Character of Virtue, which forms so large a division in the original, and which was only added to the sixth
edition, corresponds with chapter IX., under the same title. Part IV., on the effect of Utility on our moral sentiments, forms
chapter XII., in which all that is said on the subject in different passages is brought together. Part VII., or Systems of Moral
Philosophy, helps in the thirteenth chapter to throw into clear light the relation of Adam Smith's theory to other theories of
moral philosophy. The three chapters on the relation of religion to morality, on the theory of happiness, and on final causes
in ethics, correspond with no similar divisions in the original, but are severally collected from different passages in the book,
which, scattered through the work, impress upon it a distinctive character, and constitute the chief part of its colouring. The
last chapter of all serves to illustrate the historical importance of Adam Smith's work by showing the large part which it fills
An accidental coincidence between Adam Smith's theory and a passage in Polybius has unnecessarily been considered the
original source of the Theory of Moral Sentiments. The very same passage is referred to by Hume, as showing that Polybius,
like many other ancient moralists, traced our ideas of morality to a selfish origin. Yet there is nothing Adam Smith resented
more strongly than any identification of his theory with the selfish system of morality. The coincidence is therefore probably
accidental; but the passage is worth quoting, as containing in a few lines the central idea of the doctrine about to be con
sidered. Polybius is speaking of the displeasure felt by people for those who, instead of making suitable returns of gratitude
and assistance for their parents, injure them by words or actions; and he proceeds to say that "man, who among all the
various kinds of animals is alone endowed with the faculty of reason, cannot, like the rest, pass over such actions, but will
make reflection on what lie sees; and comparing likewise the future with the present, will not fail to express his indignation
at this injurious treatment, to which, as he foresees, he may also at some time be exposed. Thus again, when any one who
has been succoured by another in time of danger, instead of showing the like kindness to this benefactor, endeavours at any
time to destroy or hurt him; it is certain that all men must be shocked by such ingratitude, through sympathy with the
resentment of their neighbour; and from an apprehension also that the case may be their own. And from hence arises, in the
mind of every man, a certain notion of the nature and force of duty, in which consists both the beginning and end of justice.
In like manner, the man who, in defence of others is seen to throw himself the foremost into every danger, never fails to
obtain the loudest acclamations of applause and veneration from the multitude; while he who shows a different conduct is
pursued with censure and reproach. And thus it is that the people begin to discern the nature of things honourable and base,
and in what consists the difference between them; and to perceive that the former, on account of the advantage that attends
To explain the origin of our ideas of right and wrong, and to find for them, if possible, a solid basis of authority, apart from
their coincidence with the dogmas of theology, was the problem of moral philosophy which chiefly occupied the speculation
of the last century, and to which Adam Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments was one of the most important contributions.
His theory, like all others, must be understood as an answer to the question: How do we come to regard certain actions or
states of mind with approval and to condemn their contraries, and on what grounds can we justify our judgments in such
But in order to understand Adam Smith's answer to this question, and his position in the history of thought, it is necessary to
refer briefly to the theories of his predecessors down to the time when he took up the thread of the speculation and offered
From the time when such problems first became popular in England, two main currents of thought may be detected running
side by side in mutual antagonism to one another; and whilst according to the teaching of the one school the ultimate
standard of morality was the interest of the individual himself or the community he belonged to, the aim of the opposite
school was to find some basis for morality which should make it less dependent on changes of circumstance and give to its
The names of Locke, Hobbes, Mandeville, and Hume, are associated with the former school; those of Clarke, Price, Lord
Shaftesbury, Bishop Butler, and Hutcheson, with the latter; and the difference between them is generally ex- pressed by
classing the former together as the Utilitarian, Selfish, or Sceptical School, and the latter as the school of Intuitionalists. 
The doctrine of Hobbes, that morality was identical with the positive commands and prohibitions of the lawgiver, and that
the law was thus the real ultimate source and standard of all right and wrong, gave rise to several systems which sought in
different ways to find for our moral sentiments a less variable and unstable foundation than was implied by such an
hypothesis. It was in opposition to such a theory that Clarke and Price, and other advocates of the so-called Rational or
Intellectual system, attributed our perception of moral distinctions to intuitions of our intellect, so that the truths of morality
might appear, like those of mathematics, eternal and immutable, independent of peculiarities of time and place, and with an
existence apart from any particular man or country, just as the definitions of geometry are independent of any particular
straight lines or triangles. To deny, for example, that a man should do for others what he would wish done for himself was,
according to Clarke, equivalent to a contention that, though two and three are equal to five, yet five is not equal to two and
But the same foundation for an immutable morality that Clarke sought for in the human intellect, others sought for in a
peculiar instinct of our nature. Thus Lord Shaftesbury postulated the existence of a moral sense, sufficient of itself to make
us eschew vice and follow after virtue; and this moral sense, or primitive instinct for good, was implanted in us by nature,
and carried its own authority with it. It judged of actions by reference to a certain harmony between our affections, and this
harmony had a real existence, independent of' all fashion and caprice, like harmony in music. As symmetry and proportion
were founded in nature, howsoever barbarous might be men's tastes in the arts, so, in morals, an equally real harmony
This idea of a Moral Sense as the source and standard of our moral sentiments was so far developed by Hutcheson, that time
Moral Sense theory of ethics had been more generally connected with his name than with that of its real originator.
Hutcheson argued that as we have external senses which perceive sounds and colours, so we have internal senses which
perceive moral excellence and the contrary. This moral sense had its analogues in our sense of beauty and harmony, our
sympathetic sense, our sense of honour, of decency, and so forth. It was a primitive faculty of our nature, a factor incapable
of resolution into simpler elements. It could not, for instance, be resolved into a perception of utility, for bad actions were
often as useful as good ones and yet failed to meet with approbation, nor could it be explained as a mode of sympathy, for
Bishop Butler, like his contemporary, Hutcheson, also followed Lord Shaftesbury in seeking in our natural instincts the
origin of our moral ideas, Conscience with him taking the place of the Moral Sense, from its being possessed, as he thought,
of a more authoritative character. Conscience, ac- cording to Butler, was a faculty natural to man, in virtue of which he was
a moral agent; a faculty or principle of the human heart, in kind and nature supreme over all others, and bearing its own
authority For being so. Using language about it, which we meet again in the Theory of Adam Smith, he spoke of it as "God's
viceroy," "the voice of God within us," " the guide assigned to us by the Author of our nature." The obligation to obey it
therefore rested in the fact of its being the law of our nature. It could no more be doubted that shame was given us to
It was at this point that Adam Smith offered his solution of the difficulty. For call it Conscience, Moral Sense, or what you
will, such expressions are evidently only re-statements of the problem to be explained. To call the fact of moral approbation
by such terms was simply to give it other names; and to say that our conscience or moral sense admitted of no analysis was
equivalent to saying that our moral sentiments admitted of no explanation. Adam Smith's theory must therefore be
understood as an attempt to explain what the Intuitionalist school really gave up as inexplicable; and it represents the
reaction against that a priori method which they had employed in dealing with moral problems. In that reaction, and in his
appeal to the facts of experience, Adam Smith followed the lead of both Hartley and Hume. Ten years before him, time
former, in his Observations on Man, had sought to explain the existence of the moral sense, by tracing it back to its lowest
terms in the pleasures and pains of simple sensation, and marking its growth in the gradual association of our ideas. And
Hume, a few years later, sought to discover "the universal principle from which all censure or approbation was ultimately
derived" by the experimental method of inquiry ; by comparing, that is, a number of instances of qualities held estimable on
the one hand and qualities held blameable on the other, and observing what was the common element of each. From such an
inquiry he inferred that those acts were good which were useful and those bad which were injurious, and that the fact of
Thus it will be seen that the question of chief interest in Adam Smith's time was widely different from that which had divided
the schools of antiquity. The aim or chief good of life which chiefly occupied them had receded into the back- ground; and
the controversy concerned, as Hume declared, "the general foundation of morals," whether they were derived from Reason
or from Sentiment, whether they were arrived at by a chain of argument and process of reasoning or by a certain immediate
But round this central question of the origin of our feelings of moral approbation other questions of considerable interest
were necessarily grouped. There was the question of the authority and sanction of our moral sentiments, independently of
their origin; and there was the question of the ultimate standard or test of moral actions. And these questions involved yet
others, as for example: What was the relation of morality to religion? How far did they necessarily coincide, and how far
were they independent of each other? Was human nature really corrupt, and to what degree were the ordinary sanctions of
this life a sufficient safeguard for the existence of morality? Did happiness or misery, good or evil, really predominate in the
world; and was there such a thing as disinterested benevolence, or might all virtue be resolved into self-love and be really
The latter alternative had been the thesis which Mandeville had partly made and partly found popular. In his view the most
virtuous actions might be resolved into selfishness, and self-love was the starting-point of all morality. This became
therefore, one of the favourite topics of speculation; but it is only necessary to notice Hume's treatment of it, inasmuch as it
supplies the first principle of Adam Smith's theory. Hume assumed the existence of a disinterested principle underlying all
our moral sentiments. He argued that "a natural principle of benevolence," impelling us to consider the interests of others,
was an essential part of human nature. "The very aspect," he said, "of happiness, joy, prosperity, gives pleasure; that of pain,
suffering, sorrow communicates uneasiness." And this fellow-feeling with others he had refused to resolve into any more
This phenomenon of Sympathy, or fellow-feeling, which we have by nature with any passion whatever of another person, is
made by Adam Smith the cardinal point and distinctive feature of his theory of the origin of moral approbation; and the first
sentence of his treatise contains therefore not only his answerone of flat contradictionto Mandeville, but the key-note to
the whole spirit of his philosophy. "How selfish soever," he begins, "man may be supposed, there are evidently some
principles in his nature which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he
derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it." So that pity or compassion, which Hobbes had explained as the
consciousness of a possible misfortune to ourselves similar to that seen to befall another, is, with Adam Smith, a primary,
not a secondary, emotion of our nature, an original and not a derivative passion, and one that is purely disinterested in its
In the next chapter and the four succeeding ones we shall observe how on this basis of an original instinct of sympathy Adam
Smith constructs his explanation of the origin of our moral ideas. With regard to the explanations already offered by
previous writers, he believed that they all contained some portion of the truth from the particular point of view taken by
each; and in the explanation which he himself elaborated, he thought that some part or other of his system embraced and
The phenomena of sympathy or fellow-feeling show, according to Adam Smith, that it is one of the original passions of
human nature. We see it in the immediate transfusion of an emotion from one man to another, which is antecedent to any
knowledge on our part of the causes of another man's grief or joy. It is a primary factor of our constitution as human beings,
as is shown in the instinctive withdrawal of our limbs from the stroke we see aimed at another. It is indeed something almost
physical, as we see in the tendency of a mob to twist their bodies simultaneously with the movements of a rope-dancer, or in
Sympathy originates in the imagination, which alone can make us enter into the sensations of others. Our own senses, for
instance, can never tell us anything of the sufferings of a man on the rack. It is only by imagining ourselves in his position, by
changing places with him in fancy, by thinking what our own sensations would be in the same plight, that we come to feel
what he endures, and to shudder at the mere thought of the agonies be feels. But an analogous emotion springs up, whatever
may be the nature of the passion, in the person principally affected by it; and whether it be joy or grief, gratitude or
resentment, that another feels, we equally enter as it were into his body, and in some degree become the same person with
him. The emotion of a spectator always corresponds to what, by bringing the case of another home to himself, he imagines
But although sympathy is thus an instantaneous emotion, and the expression of grief or joy in the looks or gestures of
another affect us with some degree of a similar emotion, from their suggestion of a general idea of his bad or good fortune,
there are some passions with whose expression no sympathy arises till their exciting cause is known. Such a passion is anger,
for instance. When we witness the signs of anger in a man we more readily sympathize with the fear or resentment of those
endangered by it than with the provoked man himself. The general idea of provocation excites no sympathy with his anger,
for we cannot make his passion our own till we know the cause of his provocation. Even our sympathy with joy or grief is
very imperfect, till we know the cause of it: in fact, sympathy arises not so much from the view of any passion as from that
of the situation which excites it. Hence it is that we often feel for another what he cannot feel him- self, that passion arising
in our own breast from the mere imagination which even the reality fails to arouse in his. We sometimes, for instance, blush
for the rudeness of another who is insensible of any fault himself, because we feel how ashamed we should have felt had his
conduct and situation been ours. Our sorrow, again, for an idiot is no reflection of any sentiment of his, who laughs and
sings, and is unconscious of his misery; nor is our sympathy with the dead due to any other consideration than the
conception of ourselves as deprived of all the blessings of life and yet conscious of our deprivation. To the change produced
upon them we join our own consciousness of that change, our own sense of the loss of the sunlight of human affections, and
But whatever may be the cause of sympathy, there is no doubt of the pleasure which the consciousness of a concord of
feeling produces, and of the pain which arises from a sense of its absence. Some have accounted for this by the principle of
self-love, by saying that the consciousness of our own weakness and our need of the assistance of others makes us to rejoice
in their sympathy as an earnest of their assistance, and to grieve in their indifference as a sign of their opposition. But both
the pleasure and pain are felt so instantaneously, and upon such frivolous occasions, that it is impossible to explain them as a
refinement of self-love. For instance, we are mortified if nobody laughs at our jests, and are pleased if they do; not from any
Neither can the fact, that the correspondence of the sentiments of others with our own is a cause of pleasure, and the want
of it a cause of pain, be accounted for entirely by the additional zest which the joy of others communicates to our own, or by
the disappointment which the absence of it causes. The sympathy of others with our own joy may, indeed, enliven that joy,
and so give us pleasure; but their sympathy with our grief could give us no pleasure, if it simply enlivened our grief.
Sympathy, however, whilst it enlivens joy, alleviates grief, and so gives pleasure n either case, by the mere fact of the
The sympathy of others being more necessary for us in grief than in joy, we are more desirous to communicate to others our
disagreeable passions than our agreeable ones. "The agreeable passions of love and joy can satisfy and support the heart
without any auxiliary pleasure. The bitter and painful emotions of grief and resentment more strongly require the healing
consolation of sympathy." Hence we are less anxious that our friends should adopt our friendships than that they should
enter into our resentments, and it makes us much more angry if they do not enter into our resentments than if they do not
But sympathy is pleasurable, and the absence of it distressing, not only to the person sympathized with, but to the person
sympathizing. We are ourselves pleased if we can sympathize with another's success or affliction, and it pains us if we
cannot. The consciousness of an inability to sympathize with his distress, if we think his grief excessive, gives us even more
Such are the physical and instinctive facts of sympathy upon which Adam Smith founds his theory of the origin of moral
approbation and our moral ideas. Before proceeding with this development of his theory, it is worth noticing again its close
correspondence with that of Hume, who likewise traced moral sentiments to a basis of physical sympathy. "Wherever we
go," says Hume, "whatever we reflect on or converse about, everything still presents us with the view of human happiness or
misery, and excites in our breast a sympathetic movement of pleasure or uneasiness." Censure or applause are, then, the
result of the influence of sympathy upon our sentiments. If the natural effects of misery, such as tears and cries and groans,
never fail to inspire us with compassion and uneasiness, "can we be supposed altogether insensible or indifferent towards its
Having analyzed the facts of sympathy, and shown that the correspondence of the sentiments of others with our own is a
direct cause of pleasure to us, and the want of it a cause of pain, Adam Smith proceeds to show that the amount of pleasure
or pain felt by one man in the conduct or feelings of another is the measure of his approbation or the contrary. The
sentiments of any one are just and proper, or the reverse, according as they coincide or not with the sentiments of some one
else who observes them. His approbation varies with the degree in which he can sympathize with them, and perfect concord
Just as a man who admires the same poem or picture that I do, or laughs at the same joke, allows the justice of my
admiration or mirth, so he, who enters into my resentment, and by bringing my injuries home to himself shares my feelings,
cannot but thereby approve of them as just and proper. According as his sympathetic indignation fails to correspond to mine,
according as his compassion falls short of my grief, according, in short, to the degree of disproportion he may perceive
Moral approbation admits of the same explanation as intellectual approbation. For just as to approve or disapprove of the
opinions of others is nothing more than to observe their agreement or disagreement with our own, so to approve or
disapprove of their feelings and passions is simply to mark a similar agreement or disagreement existing between our own
Consequently the sentiments of each individual are the standard and measure of the correctness of another's, and it is hardly
possible for us to judge of another's feelings by any other canon than the correspondent affection in ourselves. The only
measure by which one man can judge of the faculty of another is by his own faculty of the like kind. As we judge of
another's eyesight, hearing, or reason, by comparison with our own eyesight, hearing, or reason, so we can only judge of
another's love or resentment by our own love or our own resentment. If, upon bringing the case of another home to
ourselves, we find that the sentiments which it produces in him coincide and tally with our own, we necessarily ap- prove of
his as proportioned and suitable to their objects, while if otherwise, we necessarily disapprove of them as extravagant and
Since, then, one point of view in every moral judgment is the "suitableness" which any affection of the heart bears to the
cause or object which excites it, the propriety or impropriety of the action, which results from such affection, depends
entirely on the concord or dissonance of the affection with that felt sympathetically by a spectator. Hence that part of moral
approbation which consists in the sense of the Propriety of a sentiment to its cause (say, of anger to its provocation), arises
simply from the perception of a coincidence between the sentiment of the person primarily affected by it and that of the
Let us take, for instance, as a concrete case, the exhibition of fortitude under great distress. What is the source of our
approbation of it? It is the perfect coincidence of another's firmness with our own insensibility to his misfortunes. By his
making no demand on us for that higher degree of sensibility which we find to our regret that we do not possess, he effects a
most perfect correspondence between his sentiments and ours, which causes us to recognize the perfect propriety of' his
conduct. The additional element which raises our feeling of mere approbation into one of admiration, is the wonder and
surprise we feel at witnessing a degree of self-command far above that usually met with among mankind. 
There are, however, several facts which modify our sense of the propriety or impropriety of another person's sentiments by
First of all, it is only when the objects which excite any sentiment bear some direct relation to the person primarily affected
by the sentiment or to ourselves as sympathetically affected by it, that any moral judgment of his sentiment arises on our
part. For instance, "the beauty of a plain, the great- ness of a mountain, the ornaments of a building, the expression of a
picture, the composition of a discourse, the conduct of a third person . . . all the general subjects of science and taste, are
what we and our companions regard as having no peculiar relation to either of us." There is no occasion for sympathy, or for
an imaginary change of situations, in order to produce, with regard to such things, the most perfect harmony of sentiments
and affections. Where there is such harmony, we ascribe to a man good taste or judgment, but recognize no degree of moral
But it is otherwise with anything which more closely affects us. A misfortune or injury to another is not regarded by him and
by us from the same point of view as a poem or picture are, for the former cannot but more closely affect him. Hence a
correspondence of feeling is much more difficult and much more important with regard to matters which nearly concern him,
than with regard to matters which concern neither him nor us, and are really indifferent to our actual interests. We can easily
bear with difference of opinion in matters of speculation or taste; but we cease to be bearable to one another, if he has no
fellow-feeling for my misfortunes or my griefs; or if he feels either no indignation at my injuries or none that bears any
This correspondence of feeling, then, being at the same time so difficult of attainment and yet so pleasurable when attained,
two operations come into play: the effort on our part, as spectators, to enter into the sentiments and passions of the person
principally concerned, and the effort on his part also to bring his sentiments into unison with ours. Whilst we strive to
assume, in imagination, his situation, he strives to assume ours, and to bring down his emotions to that degree with which
we as spectators can sympathize. Conscious as he is that our sympathy must naturally fall short of the violence of his own,
and longing as he does for that relief which he can only derive from a complete sympathy of feeling, he seeks to obtain a
more entire concord by lowering his passion to that pitch which he is sensible that we can assume. Does he feel resentment
or jealousy, he will strive to tone it down to the point at which we can enter into it. And by thus being led to imagine how he
himself would be affected, were he only a spectator of his own situation, he is brought to abate the violence of his original
passion. So that in a sort of meeting- point of sympathy lies the point of perfect propriety, as has been shown in the case of
On this twofold tendency of our moral nature two different sets of virtues are based. On our effort to sympathize with the
passions and feelings of others are founded the gentler virtues of condescension, toleration, and humanity; whilst the sterner
virtues of self-denial and self-command are founded on our effort to attune our passions to that pitch of which others can
approve. In a union of these two kinds of virtuesin feeling much for others and little for ourselves, in restraining our selfish
and indulging our benevolent affectionsconsists the highest perfection of which human nature is capable. 
But how do we pass from a perception of the propriety of these good qualities to a perception of their virtue, for propriety
and virtue mean different things? The answer is, that propriety of sentiment which, when displayed in the usual degree,
meets with our approbation merely, calls for our admiration and becomes virtuous when it surprises us by an unusual
manifestation of it. Admiration is "approbation, heightened by wonder and surprise." "Virtue is excellence, something
uncommonly great and beautiful, which rises far above what is vulgar and ordinary." There is no virtue in the ordinary
display of the moral qualities, just as in the ordinary degree of the intellectual qualities there are no abilities. For sensibility to
be accounted humanity it must exceed what is possessed by the "rude vulgar of mankind;" and, in like manner, for
self-command to amount to the virtue of fortitude, it must be much more than the weakest of mortals is capable of exerting. 
There are, in fact, two different standards by which we often measure the degree of praise or blame due to any action, one
consisting in the idea of complete propriety or perfection, in comparison with which all human action must ever appear
blameable, and the other consisting in that approach to such perfection of which the majority of men are capable. Just in the
same way as a work of art may appear very beautiful when judged by the standard of ordinary perfection, and appear full of
faults when judged by the standard of absolute perfection, so a moral action or sentiment may frequently deserve applause
It having thus been shown that the propriety of any sentiment lies in a meeting-point between two different sympathies, or in
a sort of compromise between two different aspects of' the same passion, it is evident that such propriety must lie in a
certain mediocrity or mean state between two extremes, or in just that amount of passion into which an impartial spectator
can enter. That grief or resentment, for example, is proper which errs neither on the side of excess or of defect, which is
neither too much nor too little. The impartial spectator, being unable either to enter into an excess of resentment or to
sympathize with its deficiency, blames the one extreme by calling it" fury," and the other by calling it "want of spirit." 
On this point it is noticeable that Adam Smith's theory of Propriety agrees, as he says him self, "pretty exactly" with
Aristotle's definition of Virtue, as consisting in a mean or  between two extremes of excess or defect. For in- stance,
courage, according to Aristotle, lies in the mean state between the opposite vices of cowardice and rashness. Frugality is a
similar avoidance of both avarice and prodigality, and magnanimity consists in avoiding the extremes of either arrogance or
pusillanimity. And as also coincident in every respect with his own theory of Propriety, Adam Smith claims Plato's account
of virtue given in the Republic, where it is shown to consist in that state of mind in which every faculty confines itself to its
proper sphere without encroaching on that of any other, and performs its proper office with exactly that degree of strength
But it is obvious that the mean state or point of propriety must be different in different passions, lying nearer to the excess in
some and nearer to the defect in others. And it will be found that the decency or indecency of giving expression to our
passions varies exactly in proportion to the general disposition of mankind to sympathize with them. 
To illustrate the application of this principle, Adam Smith divides all human passions into five different classes. These are the
Passions which take their origin from the body, those which take their origin from a particular turn of the imagination, the
unsocial Passions, the social Passions, and the selfish Passions. And whatever doubts may be felt as to the truth of Adam
Smith's general theory of the origin of moral approbation, there is no doubt of the interest which attaches to his account of
1. To begin with the passions which have their origin from the body. The bodily passions, such as hunger and thirst, being
purely personal, fail to excite any general sympathy, and in proportion to the impossibility of such sympathy is the
impropriety or indecency of any strong expression of them. The real origin of our dislike to such passions when we witness
them in others, the real reason why any strong expressions of them are so disagreeable, is not the fact that such passions are
those which we share in common with the brutes (for we also share with them natural affection and gratitude), but simply
With the passions which arise from the imagination it is otherwise than with passions which originate from the body. For
instance, a disappointment in love or ambition calls forth more sympathy than the greatest bodily evil, for our imagination
lends itself more readily to sympathize with the misfortunes affecting the imaginations of others, than is possible in the case
of the sufferings of their bodies. Our imagination moulds itself more easily upon the imagination of another than our bodily
frame can be affected by what affects his. Thus we can readily sympathize with a man who has lost his fortune, for he only
suffers in his imagination, not in his body; and we can fancy, just as he does, the loss of dignity, the neglect of his friends, the
contempt from his enemies, the dependence, want, and misery which he himself foresees in store for him. The loss of a leg is
a more real calamity than the loss of a mistress; but whilst it would be ridiculous to found a tragedy on the former loss, the
latter misfortune has given rise to many a fine play. Mere pain never calls forth any lively sympathy, and for that reason there
were no greater breaches of decorum committed in the plays of the Greeks, than in the attempt to excite compassion by the
representation of physical agonies, as in the cries of Philoctetes,(5) or the tortures of Hippolytus and Hercules. It is on this
little sympathy which we feel with bodily pain that is founded the propriety of constancy and patience in its endurance. 
2. Where, however, a passion takes its origin from a particular turn of the imagination, the imagination of others, not
having acquired that particular turn, cannot sympathize with the passion, and so finds it in some measure ridiculous. This is
particularly the case with the passion of love. We may sympathize with our friend's resentment, if he has been injured, or
enter into his gratitude, if he has received a benefit; but if he is in love, however reasonable we may think it, "the passion
appears to everybody, but the man who feels it, entirely disproportioned to the value of the object; and love, though it is
pardoned in a certain age, because we know it is natural, is always laughed at because we cannot enter into it. All serious
and strong expressions of it appear ridiculous to a third person; and though a lover may be good company to his mistress, he
is so to nobody else. He himself is sensible of this; and, as long as he continues in his sober senses, endeavours to treat his
own passion with raillery and ridicule. It is the only style in which we care to hear of it, because it is the only style in which
Our philosopher however admits, that though we cannot properly enter into the attachment of the lover, we readily
sympathize with his expectations of happiness. Though his passion cannot interest us, his situation of mingled hope and fear
interests us, just as in the description of a sea voyage it is not the hunger of the crew which interests us but the distress
which it occasions them. When love is interesting on the stage, it is so simply from the distress it occasions. A scene of two
lovers, in perfect security, expressing their mutual fondness for one another, would excite laughter and not sympathy. Such a
scene is never endured but from concern for the dangers and difficulties foreseen in the sequel, or from interest in the
secondary passionsfear, shame, and despairwhich are associated with love as a situation, and with which alone we can
3. In the third place come the unsocial passions, such as hatred and resentment, with all their modifications. They also are
founded on the imagination, but have to be consider- ably modified before they touch that point of propriety with which an
impartial spectator can sympathize. For these passions give rise to a double sympathy, or rather divide our sympathy
between the person who feels them and the person who is the object of them. Though we may sympathize with him who has
received a provocation, we also sympathize with his adversary, if he becomes the object of undue resentment. We enter into
the situation of both, and the fear we feel with the one moderates the resentment we feel with the other. Hence for
resentment to attain the mean of propriety, it must be more reduced from its natural degree than almost any other passion;
and the greater restraint a man puts on his anger, the more will mankind, who have a very strong sense of the injuries done
These unsocial passions are, however, necessary parts of human nature, and as on the one hand we cannot sympathize with
excessive indignation, so on the other hand we blame and despise a man "who tamely sits still and submits to insults," from
our inability to comprehend his insensibility and want of spirit. These passions are therefore useful to the individual, as
serving to protect him from insult and injury; but there is still something disagreeable in them which makes their appearance
in others the natural object of our aversion. It is so even when they are most justly provoked. Hence they are the only
passions, the mere expression of which does not command our sympathies till we know the cause. The voice of misery, or
the sight of gladness, at once communicates to us corresponding sentiments; but the tones of hatred or resentment inspire us
naturally with fear and aversion. For that reason the music, which imitates such passions, is not the most agreeable, its
periods being, unlike those which express joy or grief or love, "irregular, sometimes very short, sometimes very long, and
For all these reasons it is very difficult to adjust resentment to the point of propriety demanded by the sympathy of others.
The provocation must be such that we should incur contempt for not resenting it; and smaller offences are better neglected.
We should resent more from a sense that mankind expect it of us than from the impulse of the passion itself. There is no
passion concerning whose indulgence we should more carefully consider the sentiments of the cool and impartial spectator.
Magnanimity, or a regard to maintain our own rank and dignity, can alone ennoble its expression; and we should shows from
our whole manner, that passion has not extinguished our humanity, and that, if we yield to revenge, we do so with
4. With regard to the social passions, such as generosity, humanity, kindness, compassion, or friendship, the facts are quite
different. Not only is the mere expression of these sentiments agreeable, but they are made doubly agreeable by a division of
the spectator's sympathies between the person who feels them and the person who is the object of them. We enter with
pleasure into the satisfaction of both, into the agreeable emotions of the man who is generous or compassionate, and into the
Hence in these passions the point of propriety lies nearer to the excess than to the defect, just as in the opposite passions it
lay nearer to the defect. "There is something agreeable even in the weakness of friendship and humanity," and if we blame
the too tender mother, the too indulgent father, or the too generous friend, it is always with sympathy and kindness, and
5. Between the social and the unsocial passions the selfish passions occupy a middle place. These are joy and grief for our
own personal good or bad fortune. Since no opposite sympathy can ever interest the spectator against them, their excessive
expression is never so disagreeable as excessive resentment; and for the reason that no double sympathy can ever interest us
We are, Adam Smith thinks, naturally disposed to sympathize more with our neighbours' small joys than with their great
ones, and more with their great sorrows than with their small ones. A man raised suddenly to a much higher position may be
sure that the congratulations of his best friends are not perfectly sincere. If he has any judgment, he is sensible of this, and,
instead of appearing elated, endeavours to smother his joy, and keep down his elevation of mind. He affects the same
plainness of dress, and the same modesty of behaviour, which became him before, and redoubles his attentions to his former
friends. So his conduct may meet with our approval, for "we expect, it seems, that he should have more sympathy with our
With the smaller joys of life it is different. The ability of the spectators to sympathize with these places the point of propriety
in their indulgence much higher. We readily sympathize with habitual cheerfulness, which spreads itself', as it were, by
infection. Hence it is hardly possible to express too much satisfaction in the little occurrences of' common life, in the
company of yesterday evening, in the entertainment generally, in what was said or done, "and in all those frivolous nothings
It is otherwise with grief, for while small vexations excite no sympathy, deep affliction calls for the greatest. A man will meet
with little sympathy, who is hurt if his cook or butler have failed in the least article of their duty; who is vexed if his brother
hummed a tune all the time he was telling a story; who is put out of humour by the badness of the weather when in the
country, by the badness of the roads when upon a journey, or by want of company and dulness when in town. Grief is
painful to ourselves or to others, and we should endeavour either not to conceive it at all about trifles, or to shake it off if
we do. There is a certain "malice in mankind which not only prevents all sympathy with little uneasinesses, but renders them
But though we all take delight in raillery, and in the small vexations which occur to our companions, our sympathy with
them in case of deep distress is very strong and very sincere. "If you labour under any signal calamity; if by some
extraordinary misfortune you are fallen into poverty, into diseases, into disgrace and disappointment . . . you may generally
depend upon the sincerest sympathy of all your friends, and, as far as interest and honour will permit, upon their kindest
assistance too. But if your misfortune is not of this dreadful kind, if you have only been a little baulked in your ambition, if
you have only been jilted by your mistress, or are only henpecked by your wife, lay your account with the raillery of all your
The sense of the propriety or impropriety of a moral action or sentiment is, according to Adam Smith, only one side of the
fact of moral approbation, a sense of their merit or demerit constituting the other side. An action or sentiment is proper or
improper in relation to its cause, or the motive which excites it, whilst it is meritorious or the contrary in relation to its
It is important to notice this distinction, for it is a protest, as Adam Smith himself declares, against the theories of Dr.
Hutcheson and Hume, who, he complains, had considered too much the tendency of affections, their good or bad results,
whilst neglecting the relation in which they stood to their causes. This was to overlook the facts of common life, since a
person's conduct and sentiments are generally regarded under both these aspects, a man receiving blame for excess of love,
or grief, or resentment, not only by reason of the ruinous effects they tend to produce, but also on account of the little
occasion that was given for them. It is the want of proportion between a passion and its cause, as well as the sense of its
disastrous effects, which make up the whole character of moral disapprobation. Whilst praise or blame are attached to the
first aspect of an action or sentiment, a stronger feeling of sympathy or antipathy attaches itself to either in connexion with
their effects, a feeling that they deserve reward or punishment, a feeling in other words of their merit or demerit. 
As gratitude is the feeling which most directly prompts us to reward another man, and resentment that which most directly
prompts us to punish him, an action will call for reward or punishment according as it is the object of either of these feelings.
The measure, therefore, of the merit or demerit of any action will be the feeling of gratitude or resentment it excites. 
But here again the principle of sympathy must come into play, to decide on the rightfulness of the gratitude or resentment.
An action can only seem meritorious or the contrary, as deserving of reward or punishment, if it is the proper and right
object of gratitude or resentment; and only that gratitude or resentment can be proper which commands the sympathy of the
impartial spectator. That man's action deserves reward as meritorious who to somebody is the object of a gratitude which
every human heart is disposed to beat time to, whilst his action seems to deserve punishment as bad who to somebody is the
object of a resentment which every reasonable man can sympathize with and adopt. According as everybody who hears of
any action would wish to see it rewarded or punished may it fairly be accounted meritorious or the reverse. 
In regarding, then, the beneficial or hurtful tendency of actions, our sense of their merit or demerit, due to sympathy with the
Sympathizing as we do with the joy of others in prosperity, we also join them in the satisfaction with which they regard the
cause of their good fortune. If the cause has been a man, this is more especially the case. We regard him in the same
engaging light in which we imagine he must appear to the object of his bounty, whilst our sympathy with the joy of the latter
In the same manner we sympathize not only with the distress or sorrow of another, but with the aversion he feels towards
the cause of it. When we see one man oppressed or injured by another, our sympathy with the sufferer only animates our
fellow-feeling with his resentment against his oppressor. So we even enter into the imaginary resentment of the slain, and by
an illusive sympathy with that resentment which we know he would feel, were he alive, exact vengeance from the criminal
But although our sympathy with the beneficial results of an act may thus lead us to join in the gratitude it occasions, and so
to regard it as meritorious or deserving of reward, this is only, as has been said, one side or aspect of complete moral
approbation. To constitute the latter, a sense of the propriety of an action must be joined to a sense of its merit.; and an
action is only then really good when we can sympathize with the motives of the agent as well as with the gratitude his
conduct produces. Wherever we cannot enter into the affections of the agent, wherever we cannot recognize any propriety
in the motives which influenced him, we fail to sympathize with the gratitude of the person he has befriended. Where, for
instance, the greatest benefits have been conferred from the most trivial motives, as where a man gives an estate to another
simply because his name or his surname happen to be the same as his own, little gratitude seems due; and con- sequently the
action, though beneficial in its tendency, since it fails to command our complete sympathy, fails to command our complete
So on the other hand, however hurtful in their tendency a man's actions or intentions may be, if we sympathize with his
motives, that is, if we look upon him as in the right, we can feel no sympathy with the resentment of the person injuriously
affected by him. If he suffers no more than our own sympathetic indignation would have prompted us to inflict upon him, we
have no fellow-feeling with his suffering, and consequently no sense of the demerit of the action he regards with resentment.
It would be impossible, for instance, to sympathize with the resentment expressed by a murderer against his judge. So that to
constitute the sentiment of complete moral disapprobation, there must be impropriety of motive on the part of the agent as
well as a hurtful result to some one else; or, in other words, for an action to be pronounced by our sympathetic imagination
completely bad, it must be both improper in its motive and injurious in its result. It is not enough for it to be simply
It results therefore from this analysis, that a complete sense of the merit of an action, or the feeling of perfect moral
approbation, is really "a compounded sentiment," made up of two distinct sympathetic emotions, namely, of a direct
sympathy with the sentiments of the agent, and an indirect sympathy with the gratitude of those who receive the benefit of
his actions. Take our sense of the good desert of a particular character in historyScipio, Timoleon, or Aristides. In
imagination we become those very persons, and, by a direct sympathy with them, enter into their designs, and feel the same
generous sentiments that they felt. But we also by an indirect sympathy feel the benefit of their great actions, and enter into
the gratitude of those who experienced them. The sympathetic emotions of gratitude and love, which we thus feel when we
bring home to our own breast the situation of those originally concerned, account for our whole sense of the merit of such
In the same way a complete sense of the demerit of an action is a compounded sentiment made up of two distinct emotions;
of a direct antipathy to the sentiments of the agent, and an indirect sympathy with the resentment of the sufferer. We feel a
direct antipathy to the detestable sentiments which actuated a Borgia or a Nero, while we sympathize indirectly with the
resentment of those they afflicted. Our sense of the atrocity of their conduct, and our delight in hearing of its punishmentin
short, our whole feeling of ill desert, and of the justice of inflicting evil on the person who is guilty of it, and of making him
grieve in his turnarises from the sympathetic indignation which boils up in our breast whenever we thoroughly bring home
Nor is it any degradation of our sense of the demerit of actions to ascribe it to our sympathy with the resentment of another.
Resentment is in every respect the counterpart of gratitude, and if our sense of merit arises from our sympathy with the one,
our sense of demerit may well arise from our sympathy with the other. Resentment, too, as a principle of human nature, is
only evil when it appears in excess as revenge; and as it is excessive a hundred times for once that it is moderate, we are apt
to consider it altogether detestable, because in its ordinary manifestation it is so. But it is not disapproved of when properly
humbled, and entirely brought down to the level of the sympathetic indignation of the spectator. When we as bystanders
entertain an animosity corresponding to that of the sufferer, when his resentment in no respect exceeds our own, when no
word nor gesture escapes him that denotes an emotion more violent than we can share, and when he never aims at inflicting
a punishment severer than that we should rejoice to see inflicted or would inflict ourselves, it is impossible that we should
It appears then in Adam Smith's theory, that the element of morality in actions only really arises from reference to their
tendency. The sentiment or affection of the heart from which all action results may in relation to its cause or motive be
regarded as unsuitable or disproportionate, according as it exceeds or falls short of that mean point with which the general
observer can sympathize. It may be thus approved or disapproved as proper or improper, but it is not applauded or
condemned as moral or immoral. An anger which is out of proportion to the cause of its provocation, a state of joy or
sorrow out of keeping with their origin, a generosity or benevolence that seem excessive, are blamed not as immoral, but as
out of harmony with the feelings of a spectator. So with reference to the bodily passions, it is the office of temperance to
confine them within those limits "which grace, which propriety, which delicacy, and modesty require," (not within those
which morality require). It is only when regard is paid to the effects which flow from different actions, that a stronger feeling
appears, a feeling not merely of propriety or im- propriety, but of their merit or demerit, or in other words, of their moral
It is only actions of a beneficent tendency, which proceed from proper motives, that are thus meritorious, for such actions
alone seem to deserve a reward, from the gratitude they command from a spectator through sympathy. And it is only actions
of a hurtful tendency, which proceed from improper motives, that seem really wicked, for they alone seem to deserve a
Adam Smith illustrates his theory that the wrongfulness or demerit of actions depends on our sense of their deserving to be
punished by the two virtues of beneficence and justice. The mere want of beneficence, the neglect to do the good expected
of one, may give rise to feelings of dislike and dis- approbation, but as it does no real positive evil, it provokes no feeling of
sympathetic resentment. Take a case of the blackest ingratitude, where a man fails to recompense his benefactor, when the
latter stands in great need of his assistance. Every impartial spectator rejects all fellow-feeling with the selfishness of his
motives, and he is the proper object of the highest disapprobation. Still since he does no positive hurt, but only neglects to
do the good he might, he is the object of hatred, not of resentment, two passions which differ in this respect, that whilst the
former is called forth by impropriety of sentiment and behaviour, the latter is only provoked by actions which tend to do real
and positive hurt to some particular persons. Ingratitude therefore cannot be punished. It is improper, and meets with the
disapprobation of the spectator, but it is not wrong or immoral, in. the sense in which it would be, if it went a step further,
The proper degree of beneficence, moreover, as that which ordinary experience leads us to expect, and also makes the
measure of our praise or blame, is in itself neither praiseworthy nor blameable. As it is only the defect of ordinary
beneficence which incurs our blame, so it is only the excess of it which deserves our praise. A father, or son, or brother, who
behaves to the correspondent relation neither better nor worse than the average of mankind do, seems to deserve neither
praise nor blame. His conduct, though it may attain that point at which we recognize its propriety and so command our
approbation, commands nothing more. It is only when we are surprised by unexpected, though proper kindness, or by
Beneficence, when it thus attains a high degree, when it becomes productive of the greatest good, at once becomes the
object of the liveliest gratitude, appears to be deserving of the highest reward, and consequently appears as meritorious and
The virtue of justice differs from that of beneficence in that the violation of it, by doing real and positive hurt to some
particular persons, from motives that are disapproved of, is the natural object of resentment, and calls in consequence for
punishment. Resentment was given to us "by nature for defence, and for defence only. It is the safeguard of justice and the
security of innocence. It prompts us to beat off the mischief which is attempted to be done to us, and to retaliate that which
is already done, that the offender may be made to repent of his injustice, and that others, through fear of the like punishment,
may be terrified from being guilty of the like offence." As mankind generally approve of the violence employed to avenge the
hurt which is, done by injustice, so they much more approve of that which is employed to pre- vent and beat off the injury,
and to restrain the offender from hurting his neighbour. Even the person guilty of intending injustice feels that force may be
used against him, both by the person he is about to injure, or by others, either to obstruct the execution of his crime, or to
This fact accounts for the great distinction between justice and all the other social virtues, that we feel a higher obligation to
act according to justice than according to friendship, charity, or generosity; and that, while the practice of the latter virtues
seems to be left in some measure to our own choice, we feel ourselves to be "in a peculiar manner tied, bound, and obliged
to the observation of justice." For we feel that force may, with the utmost propriety, and with the approbation of mankind,
be made use of to compel us to observe the rules of the one, but not to follow the precepts of the others. 
It is this feeling, then, of the legitimate use of force and punishment which makes us view with so much stronger a sense of
disapprobation actions which are unjustthat is, injurious to othersthan actions which are merely breaches of that propriety
which we like to see observed in the various relationships that connect men together. A father who fails in the ordinary
degree of parental affection to a son, or a son who is wanting in filial respect for his father, or a man who shuts up his heart
against compassion, incur, indeed, blame; but not that superior degree of blame which relates to actions of a positively
But though this superior form of disapprobation attaches itself to acts of injustice, just as a superior form of approbation
attaches itself to act ns of great beneficence, there is no more merit in the observance of justice than there is demerit in the
neglect of beneficence. "There is, no doubt, a propriety in the practice of justice, and it merits upon that account all the
approbation which is due to propriety. But as it does no real positive good, it is entitled to very little gratitude. Mere justice
is, upon most occasions, but a negative virtue, and only hinders us from hurting our neighbour. The man who barely abstains
from violating either the person or the estate or the reputation of his neighbours, has surely very little positive merit. . . . We
may often fulfil all the rules of justice by sitting still and doing nothing." As before explained, the sense of the merit of an
action is different from the sense of its propriety, and unless an action has both these characteristics, it does not really satisfy
In proportion, therefore, to the resentment naturally felt by a sufferer from injustice is the sympathetic indignation of the
spectator, and the sense of guilt in the agent. But the resentment itself, being proportioned to the evil done by an act, the
demerit of an act may be measured by the evil it causes. Death being the greatest evil one man can do to another, and
consequently incurring the highest indignation from those connected with the slain man, takes rank as the worst of all
crimes. Injuries to a man's property and possessions being less hurtful to him than an injury to his life or person, theft and
robbery rank next to murder in atrocity. And as it is a smaller evil to be disappointed of what we have only in expectation
than to be deprived of what we have in possession, breach of contract is a less heinous crime than one which attacks a man's
In the estimation of Dugald Stewart, the most valuable contribution of' Adam Smith to the improvement of moral science is
his attempt to account for the irregularity of our moral sentiments, and for their liability to be modified by other
considerations, very different from the propriety or impropriety of the affections of the agent, or from their beneficial or
hurtful tendency. Adam Smith was, he thinks, the first philosopher to appreciate thoroughly the importance of the difficulty,
which is equally great in every theory of the origin of our moral sentiments; namely, that our actual moral sentiments of
approbation, or the contrary, are greatly modified by matters extraneous to the intention of the agent; as, for example, by the
There are, first of all, the effects of prosperity and adversity on the moral judgments of men with regard to the propriety of
In equal degrees of merit there is scarcely any one who does not more respect the rich and great than the poor and humble;
and, on the other hand, an equal amount of vice and folly is regarded with less aversion and contempt in the former than it is
in the latter. How is this to be explained? and what is the origin of this perversion of moral sentiment? 
The real explanation of it is to be sought in the fact of our sympathetic emotions, which, as they enter more vividly into the
joys than into the sorrows of others, feel more pleasure in the condition of the wealthy than in that of the poor. It is
agreeable to sympathize with joy, and painful to enter into grief; so that, where there is no envy in the case, our propensity
to sympathize with joy is much stronger than our propensity to sympathize with sorrow; and our fellow-feeling for the
agreeable emotion approaches nearer to its original intensity than our fellow-feeling for the painful emotion of another
person. It is for this reason that we are more ashamed to weep than to laugh before company, though we may often have as
real occasion to do the one as the other: we always feel that the spectators are more likely to go along with us in the
agreeable than in the painful emotion. Hence our disposition to admire the rich and powerful, and to despise or neglect the
poor and lowly, arises from our association of joy and pleasure with the condition of the former, and of pain and distress
The condition of the former, in the delusive colours of our imagination, seems to be almost the abstract idea of a perfect and
happy state. Hence we feel a peculiar satisfaction with the satisfaction we attribute to them. We favour all their inclinations,
and forward all their wishes. We are eager to assist them in completing a system of happiness that approaches so near to
It is from the command which wealth thus has over the sympathetic and agreeable sentiments of mankind that leads to so
eager a pursuit and parade of it, and to so strong an aversion to, and concealment of, poverty. To what purpose is all the toil
of the world for wealth, power, and pre-eminence? The only advantage really looked to from it is "to be observed, to be
attended to, to be taken notice of with sympathy, complacency, and approbation;" and the rich man glories more in his
riches, because they naturally draw upon him the attention of the world, than for any of the other advantages connected with
them. And for the same reason the poor man is ashamed of his poverty, for though he may be as well supplied as the rich
man with the necessities of life, he is mortified at being placed out of the sight of mankind, at being treated with neglect, and
Rank and distinction are therefore coveted, as setting us in a situation most in view of general sympathy and attention. "And
thus, placethat great object which divides the wives of aldermenis the end of half the labours of human life, and is the
cause of all the tumult and bustle, all the rapine and injustice, which avarice and ambition have introduced into the world." 
And thus, from our natural disposition to admire the rich and powerful, a different standard of judgment arises about the
propriety of their conduct than that employed about the behaviour of other men. A single transgression of the rules of
temperance and propriety by a common man is generally more resented than their constant and avowed neglect by a man of
fashion. In the superior stations of life, the road to virtue and that to fortune are not always the same, as they are generally in
the middling and inferior stations. In the latter stations of life success nearly always depends on the favour and good opinion
of equals and neighbours, and these can seldom be obtained without a tolerably regular conduct. In them, therefore, "we
may generally expect a considerable degree of virtue; and fortunately for the good morals of society, these are the situations
Not only however has prosperity or adversity great influence on our moral sentiments, leading us to see a propriety in a
certain course of behaviour in the one condition which we are apt to condemn as improper in the other, but the praise or
blame we attach to any action depends to a great extent on the effect upon it of fortune or accident. Although everybody
allows that the merit or demerit of actions is still the same, whatever their unforeseen consequences may be, yet, when we
come to particular cases, it is clear that our sentiments of merit or demerit are very much affected by the actual
consequences which happen to proceed from any action, and that our sense of either of them is thereby enhanced or
Every action consists of three parts, some one of which must constitute the basis of whatever praise or blame we attribute to
it. These three parts are: the intention or affection of the heart, from which the action proceeds; the external movement of
the body which this affection causes; and the good or bad consequences which actually flow from it. It is evident that the
movement of the body, being often the same in the most innocent as in the most blameable actions  as in the case of
shooting at a bird and shooting at a mancannot be the source of praise or blame. Neither can the accidental consequences of
an action, which depend on fortune, not on the agent. The only consequences for which the latter is responsible are those in
some way connected with his intention; so that it is to the intention or affection of the heart, to the propriety or impropriety,
to the beneficence or hurt- fulness of the design, that all praise or blame, all approbation or disapprobation of any kind, must
The problem then to be explained is the fact that our sense of a man's merit or demerit is at all influenced by re- suits which
lie beyond his control, and that we moderate our praise or blame of his conduct according as his good or bad intention fails
The passions of gratitude and resentment, on which depend  our feeling of the merit or demerit of actions, are ultimately
based on the bodily sensation of pleasure and pain. They are excited primarily by whatever produces pleasure or pain, even
by inanimate objects. "We are angry for a moment even with the stone that hurts us. A child beats it, a dog barks at it, a
choleric man is apt to curse it." We should feel guilty of a sort of inhumanity, if we neglected to avenge our friend by the
destruction of the instrument that had accidently caused his death. So it is with gratitude. A sailor who mended his fire with
the plank that had saved him from shipwreck would seem guilty of an unnatural act, for we should expect him to preserve it
with care and affection. So we conceive something like a real love and affection for a snuff-box, or pen-knife, or a stick, to
which we have long been accustomed. "The house which we have long lived in, the tree whose verdure and shade we have
long enjoyed, are both looked upon with a sort of respect which seems due to such benefactors. The decay of the one, or the
Nevertheless to be the proper object of gratitude and resentment, a thing must not only be the cause of pleasure and pain,
but itself capable of feeling them in return. Animals therefore are less improper objects of gratitude and resentment than
inanimate things. "The dog that bites, the ox that gores, are both of them punished. If they have been the causes of the death
of any person, neither the public, nor the relations of the slain, can be satisfied, unless they are put to death in their turn."
And on the other hand, animals that have done a great service, are regarded with much gratitude; and we are shocked with
the ingratitude of the officer, in the Turkish Spy, who stabbed the horse which had carried him across an arm of the sea, lest
But something more is still necessary to the complete gratification of gratitude and resentment than the mere capability for
feeling pleasure or pain in return for pain or pleasure caused. The latter must have been caused by design, and there must be
a consciousness of design in the return. The object of resentment is chiefly not so much to make our enemy feel pain in his
turn, as to make him conscious that he feels it upon account of his past conduct, and to make him repent of that conduct.
And the chief object of gratitude is not only to make our benefactor feel pleasure in his turn, but to make him conscious that
he meets with that reward on account of his past conduct, and to make him pleased with that conduct. 
Hence three different qualifications are necessary to render anything the complete and proper object of gratitude or
resentment. It must first of all be the cause of pleasure or pain; it must secondly be capable of feeling pleasure or pain; and it
must thirdly produce pleasure or pain from a design, approved of in the one case or disapproved of in the other. 
Since then the productiveness of pleasure or pain is the primary exciting cause of gratitude or resentment, though the
intentions of any person should be ever so proper and beneficent, or ever so improper and malevolent, yet, if he has failed in
producing the good or evil he intended, less gratitude or resentment seems due to him, or in other words, less merit or
demerit seems to attach to him, because the pleasure or pain, the exciting causes of gratitude or resentment, are in either
case wanting. And so, where in a man's intentions there has been no laudable benevolence or blameable malice, but his
actions have nevertheless done great good or great evil, then some gratitude or resentment will attach to him, because their
exciting causes have been present in either case. But since the consequences of a man's actions rest altogether with fortune,
our sentiments of merit or demerit depend to a great extent upon her influence on events, upon her control of the good or
Thus the irregularity of our moral sentiments concerning the merit or demerit of actions depends ultimately on the accidental
amount of pleasure or pain they produce, since these are the primary exciting causes of our gratitude or resentment. Having
Even the impartial spectator feels in. some measure a difference of merit in a man's conduct according as his good intentions
have produced or not the results intended by him, although they may only have been defeated by accident. It is indeed
common to say, that we are equally obliged to the man who has endeavoured to serve us, as to the man who really has
served us; but this saying, "like all other fine speeches, must be understood with a grain of allowance." When all other
circumstances are equal, there will always be, even in the best and noblest mind, some difference of affection in favour of the
And as the merit of an unsuccessful attempt to do good is diminished by its miscarriage, so is the demerit of an un-
successful attempt to do evil. Except in the case of treason, the conception of which is in many countries punished as
severely as its commission, the mere design to commit a crime is scarcely ever punished as heavily as its actual perpetration.
In hardly any country is the man, who fires a pistol at his enemy but misses him, punished with death, though there is the
same degree of depravity in the criminal design as in the criminal action. "The resentment of mankind, however, runs so high
against this crime, their terror for the man who shows himself capable of committing it is so great, that the mere attempt to
commit it ought in all countries to be capital. The attempt to commit smaller crimes is almost always punished very lightly,
and sometimes is not punished at all. The thief, whose hand has been caught in his neighbour's pocket before he had taken
anything out of it, is punished with ignominy only. If he had got time to take away a handkerchief, he would have been put
to death."(6) The state of the law only reflects the natural feelings of individuals, who feel less resentment when a man has
For the same reason, a man, who has been saved purely by accident from the commission of a crime he intended, though he
is conscious that his real guilt, that of his heart, remains the same, considers himself as less deserving of resentment and
punishment; and thus all the sense of his guilt is either diminished or destroyed by the mere fact of fortune having favoured
Again, as Fortune influences our moral sentiments by lessening the good or evil, the pleasure or pain, intended by our
actions, so does she increase our sense of their merit or demerit, beyond what their mere intention would justify, when they
happen to give rise to extraordinary pleasure or pain. Even when an intention deserves neither praise nor blame, we are
conscious of a shade of merit or demerit, according to its agreeable or disagreeable effects on us. We feel a transitory
gratitude to the bearer of good tidings, and a transitory resentment to the innocent author of our sorrow. And though we
think it barbarous in Tigranes, king of Armenia, to have struck off the head of a man for being the first to announce the
approach of an enemy, yet we think it reasonable that, by the custom of all courts,.the officer who first brings the news of a
When the negligence of one man causes damage to another, even though his negligence should be no more than a want of

reason of his horse taking fright and becoming unmanageable, rode over another man's slave, to compensate the loss. The
man himself who thus unintentionally hurts another shows some sense of his own demerit by at least offering an apology.
Yet why should he make an apology more than any one else? It is because he is aware that the impartial spectator will feel
But the negligence displayed in any action may be so great as to call not merely for blame and censure, but for actual
punishment. For we may so far enter into the resentment felt by one man on account of an unintended injury done to him by
another, as to approve of his inflicting a punishment on the offender which would have seemed in excess of the demerit of
his offence had no unlucky consequences ensued. For instance, though nothing would appear more shocking to our natural
sense of equity than to execute a man merely for having carelessly thrown a stone into the street without hurting anybody,
yet, if the stone happened to kill anybody, so great would be the effect of this accident on our moral sentiments that, though
the man's folly and inhumanity would not be greater in one case than in the other, we should not consider the severest
punishment too hard for him. Gross negligence is, therefore, in law almost the same as malicious design. Lata culpa prope
But our moral sentiments arc considerably affected, not only by the fact of the prosperity or adversity of the person whose
conduct we judge, and by the influence of fortune or accident on the result of his intentions, but they are also greatly
modified by those two great principles of Custom and Fashion, which have caused so wide a difference of opinion about
what is blameable or praiseworthy to prevail in different ages and nations. For the virtues of the savage state are different
from those of the civilized state, the virtues of one profession are different from those of another, and those again which we
This fact is due to the influence of custom, or of fashion, which is a species of custom, as the custom of persons of high rank
or character. For both these affect our moral sentiments, albeit in a less degree, yet in exactly the same way that they affect
The influence of custom on our ideas of beauty is very great. For whenever two objects have been seen in frequent
conjunction together, the imagination acquires a habit of passing easily from the one to the other; and thus, from the mere
habit of expecting to see one when we see the other, though there should be no real beauty in their union, we are conscious
of an impropriety when they chance to be separated. If even a suit of clothes is without some insignificant but usual
The fashion of things changes with a rapidity proportioned to the durableness of their material. The modes of furniture
change less rapidly than those of dress, because furniture is generally more durable; but in five or six years it generally
undergoes a complete revolution, and every man sees its fashion change in many different ways even in his own lifetime. But
the productions of such arts as music, poetry, or architecture, being much more lasting, the fashion or custom, which
prevails no less over them than over whatever else is the object of taste, may continue unchanged for a much longer time. A
building may endure for ages, a beautiful air may be handed down through generations, a poem may last as long as the
world, and thus they may all set the fashion of their particular style or taste much longer than the design of a particular mode
of dress or furniture. It is only because of the greater permanence of their fashion, which prevents our having much
experience of any change in them, that makes it less easy for us to recognize that the rules we think ought to be observed in
each of the fine arts are no more founded on reason and the nature of things than they are in the matter of our furniture and
In architecture, for instance, no reason can be assigned beyond habit and custom for the propriety of attaching to each of the
five orders their peculiar ornaments. The eye, having been used to associate a certain ornamentation with a certain order,
would be offended at missing their conjunction; but it is inconceivable that, prior to established custom, five hundred other
It is the same in poetry. The ancients thought that a certain species of verse was by nature appropriated to a particular
species of writing, according to the sentiment or character intended to be described. One kind of verse was fit for grave and
another for gay themes, nor could either be interchanged without the greatest impropriety. Yet that which is the verse of
burlesque in English is the heroic verse in French, simply because "custom has made the one nation associate the ideas of
gravity, sublimity, and seriousness with that measure which the other has connected with whatever is gay, flippant, and
Custom influences our judgment no less with regard to the beauty of natural objects; and the proportions which we admire
in one kind of animal are quite different from those we admire in another. Every class of things has a beauty of its own,
Adam Smith stops short, however, of adopting the theory, so ably advocated in the last century by the Jesuit Buffier, and
followed by Sir Joshua Reynolds, that custom is the sole  principle of beauty, and that the beauty of every object consists
simply in that form and colour  which is most moral in every particular class of things. According to Buffier, in each species
of creatures, that form was most beautiful which bore the strongest character of the general fabric of its species, and had the
strongest resemblance to the greater number of the individuals with which it was classed. Hence the most customary form
was the most beautiful, and much practice was needed to judge of the beauty of distinct species of things, or to know
wherein the middle or most usual form consisted. Hence, too, different ideas of beauty existed in different countries, where
difference of climate produced difference of type. Adam Smith so far agrees with this doctrine as to acknowledge that there
is scarcely any external form so beautiful as to please, if quite contrary to custom, nor any so deformed as not to be
agreeable, if uniformly supported by it; but he also argues that, independently of custom, we are pleased by the appearance
of the utility of any formby its fitness for the purposes for which it was intended. Certain colours, moreover, are more
agreeable than others, even the first time they are beheld by us; and though he does not lay the same stress on smoothness as
Burke did, who held that nothing was beautiful that was not smooth, he also admits that a smooth surface is naturally more
The influence of custom and fashion upon our ideas of beauty generally being so great as has been explained, what is their
influence upon our ideas of beauty of conduct? To this the answer is, that their influence is perfectly similar in kind, though
not so great, or rather less potent, over morals than it is over anything else. Although there is no form of external objects to
which custom will not reconcile us, nor fashion render agreeable to us, the characters or the conduct of a Nero or a Claudius
are what no custom can ever make agreeable, or other than the objects of our hatred or derision; for the sentiments of moral
approbation and disapprobation are founded on the strongest passions of human nature, and, though they can be warpt, they
Just as custom diminishes our sense of the impropriety of' things which we are accustomed to see together, as in the case of
absurdity of dress, so familiarity from youth upwards with violence, falsehood, and injustice takes away all sense of the
enormity of such conduct; and, on the other hand, when custom and fashion coincide with the principles of right and wrong,
they enhance our moral ideas and increase our abhorrence for everything evil. "Those who have been educated in what is
really good companynot in what is commonly called suchwho have been accustomed to see nothing in the persons whom
they esteemed and lived with but justice, modesty, humanity and good order, are more shocked with whatever seems to be
Custom affords an explanation of the different ideas of good conduct prevalent in different degrees of civilization. For every
age and country look upon that degree of each quality which is most usual in those among themselves who are most
esteemed as the golden mean of that particular talent or virtue. Their sentiments concerning the degree of each quality that
deserves praise or blame vary according to the degree which is most common in their own country and times; thus, that
degree of politeness which might be thought effeminate adulation in Russia might be regarded as barbarous rudeness in
In general, the style of manners prevalent in any nation is that which is most suitable to its situation. That which is most
suitable being, then, that which is naturally most com- mon, different standards arise with regard to the general propriety of
behaviour. A savage, in continual danger, or exposed to frequent want, acquires a hardiness of character, an insensibility to
the sufferings of himself or others, which is most suitable to the circumstances of his situation, and which affords a very
different standard of self-command than that which is either usual or necessary in civilized life. The general security and
happiness which prevail in ages of culture, by affording little exercise to contempt of danger, or to the endurance of pain or
hunger, enable the virtues which are founded on humanity to be more cultivated than those which are founded on self-denial;
so that to complain when in pain, to grieve in distress, to be overcome by love or anger, are not regarded as weaknesses, as
In the different professions and ages of life the same influence of custom may be traced. In each rank and profession we
expect a degree of those manners which experience has taught us to look for in them. As in each species of natural objects
we are pleased with the conformity to the general type, so in each species of men we are pleased, "if they have neither too
much nor too  little of the character which usually accompanies their particular condition and situation." Our  approbation of
a certain kind of military character is founded entirely on habit; for we are taught  by custom to annex to the military
profession "the character of gaiety, levity, and sprightly  freedom, as well as of some degree of dissipation." Whatever
behaviour we have been  accustomed to see in any order of men, comes to be so associated with that order, that whenever 
we see the one we expect to see the other, and are pleased or disappointed according as we see it  or not. Nevertheless,
there may exist a propriety of professional behaviour, independent of  the custom which leads us to expect it; and we feel
that, apart from all custom, there is a propriety in the gravity of manners which custom has allotted to the profession of a
In the same way different manners are assigned to the different periods which mark human life. In youth we look for that
sensibility, gaiety, and vivacity which experience teaches us to expect at that age; and at the extreme of life, a certain gravity
But nevertheless it is necessary not to exaggerate the effects of custom and fashion on our moral sentiments; for it is more
concerning the propriety or impropriety of particular usages than about things of the greatest importance that their in-
fluence is most apt to cause perversion of judgment. "We expect truth and justice from an old man as well as from a young,
from a clergyman as well as from an officer; and it is in matters of small moment only that we look for the distinguishing
marks of their respective characters." No society could subsist a moment if custom could exercise such perversion over our
moral sentiments, with regard to the general style of conduct and behaviour, as it exercises with regard to the propriety of
particular usages. Uninterrupted custom prevented the philosophers of Athens recognizing the evil of infanticide; and to say
that a thing is commonly done is daily offered as an apology for what in itself is the most unjust and unreasonable conduct. 
The theory of Hutcheson, that there exists in mankind an inward moral sense concerned with the direct perception of moral
qualities in actions just as the sense of hearing or seeing is concerned with the direct perception of sounds or objects, or the
theory of Shaftesbury that what we call conscience is a primary principle of human nature irresoluble into other facts, is very
different from the theory of Adam Smith, who refers our moral perceptivity to the workings of the instinct of sympathy. 
Having accounted for our moral judgments of the actions of others by bringing them to the test of our power to sympathize
with them, he proceeds to explain our moral judgments concerning our own acts by a sort of reflex application of the same
principle of sympathy. Our sense of duty, our feeling of conscience, arises simply from the application to our own conduct of
the judgments we have learned to pass upon others. So that there really exists no moral faculty which is not originally
In the same manner as we approve or disapprove of another man's conduct, according as we feel that, when we bring his
case home to ourselves, we can sympathize or not with his motives; so we approve or disapprove of our own conduct
according as we feel that, by making our case in imagination another man's, he can sympathize or not with our motives. The
only way by which we can form any judgment about our own sentiments and motives is by removing ourselves from our
own natural station, and by viewing them at a certain distance from us; a proceeding only possible by endeavouring to view
them with the eyes of other people, or as they are likely to view them. All our judgment, therefore, concerning ourselves
must bear some secret reference either to what are or to what we think ought to be the judgment of others. We imagine
ourselves the impartial spectator of our own conduct, and according as we, from that situation, enter or not into the motives
We do not therefore start with a moral consciousness by which we learn to judge of others, but from our judgments about
others we come to have a moral consciousness of our- selves. Our first moral criticisms are exercised upon the characters
and conduct of other people, and by observing that these command either our praise or blame, and that we our- selves affect
them in the same way, we become anxious in turn to receive their praise and to avoid their censure. So we imagine what
effect our own conduct would have upon us, were we our own impartial spectators, such a method being the only
looking-glass by which we can scrutinize, with the eyes of other people, the propriety of our own conduct. 
Accordingly our sense of personal morality is exactly analogous to our sense of personal beauty. Our first ideas of beauty
and ugliness are derived from the appearance of others, not from our own. But as we are aware that other people exercise
upon us the same criticism we exercise upon them, we become desirous to know how far our figure deserves their blame or
approbation. So we endeavour by the help of a looking-glass to view ourselves at the distance and with the eyes of other
people, and are pleased or displeased with the result, according as we feel they will be affected by our appearance. 
But it is evident that we are only anxious about our own beauty or ugliness on account of its effect upon others; and that,
bad we no connexion with society, we should be altogether indifferent about either. So it is with morality. If a human
creature could grow up to manhood in some solitary place, without any communication with his own kind, "he could no
more think of his own character, of the propriety or demerit of his own sentiments, of the beauty or deformity of his own
mind, than of the beauty or deformity of his own face." Society is the mirror by which he is enabled to see all these qualities
in himself. In the countenance and behaviour of those he lives with, which always mark when they enter into or disapprove
of his sentiments, he first views the propriety or impropriety of his own passions, and the beauty or depravity of his own
The consciousness of merit, the feeling of self-approbation, admits therefore of easy explanation. Virtue is amiable and
meritorious, by reference to the sentiments of other men, by reason of its exciting certain sentiments in them; and the
consciousness that it is the object of their favourable regards is the source of that inward tranquillity and self-satisfaction
which attends it, just as the sense of incurring opposite sentiments is the source of the torments of vice. If we have done a
generous action from proper motives, and survey it in the light in which the indifferent spectator will survey it, we applaud
ourselves by sympathy with the approbation of this supposed impartial judge, whilst, by a reflex sympathy with the gratitude
paid to ourselves, we are conscious of having behaved meritoriously, of having made ourselves worthy of the most
Remorse, on the other hand, arises from the opposite sentiments; and shame is due to the reflection of the sentiments our
conduct will raise in other men. We again regard our- selves from their point of view, and so by sympathizing with the
hatred which they must entertain for our conduct, we become the object of our own blame and hatred. We enter into the
resentment naturally excited by our own acts, and anticipate with fear the punishment by which such resentment may express
itself. This remorse is, of all the sentiments which can enter the human breast, the most dreadful; "it is made up of shame
from the sense of the impropriety of past conduct; of grief for the effects of it; of pity for those who suffer by it; and of the
dread and terror of punishment from the consciousness of the justly provoked resentment of all rational creatures." 
In this consciousness of the accordance or discordance of our conduct with the feelings of others consists then all the
pleasure of a good conscience or of self-approbation, or all the pain of remorse or self-condemnation. The one is based on
our love of praise, which the comparison of our own conduct with that of others naturally evolves in us, and the other on
But if a good or bad conscience consisted simply in knowing ourselves to be the objects of praise or blame, we might
approve or condemn ourselves irrespective of the correspondence of external opinion with our real merit or demerit. It is
not, therefore, mere praise or blame that we desire or dread, but praise-worthiness or blame-worthiness; that is to say, to the
that thing, which, though it should be praised or blamed by nobody, is the proper object of those mental states. We desire
Adam Smith devotes considerable argument to the origin and explanation of this principle of our moral nature, seeking in
this way to raise the account he gives of conscience to a higher level than it could attain as a mere reflex from the sympathies
of others about ourselves. As from the love or admiration we entertain for the characters of others, we come to desire to
have similar sentiments entertained about ourselves, we should have no more satisfaction from a love or admiration
bestowed on us undeservedly than a woman who paints her face would derive any vanity from compliments paid to her
complexion. Praises bestowed on us either for actions we have not performed or for motives which have not influenced us,
are praises bestowed in reality on another person, not on ourselves, and consequently give us no sort of satisfaction. 
But for the same reason that groundless praise can give us no solid joy, the mere absence of praise deducts nothing from the
pleasure of praise-worthiness. Though no approbation should ever reach us, we are pleased to have rendered ourselves the
proper objects of approbation; and in the same way we are mortified at justly incurring blame, though no blame should ever
actually be attached to us. We view our conduct not always as the spectator actually does view it, but as he would view it if
he knew all the circumstances. We feel self-approbation or the reverse, by sympathy with sentiments which do not indeed
actually take place, but which only the ignorance of the public prevents from taking place, which we know are the natural
effects of our conduct, which our imagination strongly connects with it, and which we conceive therefore as properly
belonging to it. The satisfaction we feel with the approbation which we should receive and enjoy, were everything known,
resembles very much the satisfaction which men feel who sacrifice their lives to anticipate in imagination the praise that will
only be bestowed on them when dead, the praise which they would receive and enjoy, were they themselves to live to be
Hence self-approbation, though originally founded on the imaginary approbation of other men, becomes at last independent
of such confirmation, and the sense of the perfect propriety of our own conduct comes to need no external testimony to
assure us of it. But the love of self-approbation, which is in fact the same as the love of virtue, is still founded on an implied
reference to the verdict of persons external to ourselves, and thus the "still small voice" of conscience resolves itself into the
Adam Smith, in accordance with a leading principle of his system, the importance of which will be noticed in a subsequent
chapter, traces in this desire on our part for praise-worthiness as apart from our desire of praise, an intention of Nature for
the good of society. For though in forming man for society, she endowed him with an original desire to please and an
original aversion to offend his fellows, and, by making him to feel pleasure in their favourable, and pain in their unfavourable
regards, taught him to love their approbation, and to dislike their disapproval, she yet saw that this mere love of the one, or
dislike of the other, would not alone have rendered him fit for society. Since the mere desire for approbation could only have
made him wish to appear to be fit for society, could only have prompted him to the affectation of virtue, and to the
concealment of vice; she endowed him not only with the desire of being approved of, but with the desire of being what
ought to be approved of, or of being what he himself approves of in other men. So she made him anxious to be really fit for
society, and so she sought to inspire him with the real love of virtue and a real abhorrence of vice. 
In the same way that we are thus taught to wish to be the objects of love and admiration are we taught to wish not to be the
objects of hatred and contempt. We dread blame- worthiness, or being really blameworthy, irrespective of all actual blame
that may accrue to us. The most perfect assurance that no eye has seen our action, does not prevent us from viewing it as
the impartial spectator would have regarded it, could he have been present. We feel the shame we should be exposed to if
our actions became generally known; and our imagination anticipates the contempt and derision from which we are only
saved by the ignorance of our fellows. But if we have committed not merely an impropriety, which is an object of simple
disapprobation, but a heinous crime, which excites strong resentment, then, though we might be assured that no man would
ever know it, and though we might believe that there was no God who would ever punish it, we should still feel enough
agony and remorse, as the natural objects of human hatred and punishment, to have the whole of our lives embittered. So
great, indeed, are these pangs of conscience, that even men of the worst characters, who in their crimes have avoided even
the suspicion of guilt, have been driven, by disclosing what could never have been detected, to reconcile themselves to the
natural sentiments of mankind. So completely, even in per- sons of no sensibility, does the horror of blame-worthiness
The fact, Adam Smith thinks, calls for explanation, that while most men of ordinary capacity despise unmerited praise, even
men of the soundest judgment are mortified by un- merited reproach. For, however conscious a man may be of his own
innocence, the imputation seems often, even in his own imagination, to throw a shadow of disgrace over his character, and if
he is brought to suffer the extreme punishment of human resentment, religion alone can afford him any effectual comfort, by
teaching him of an approbation, higher and more important than that of humanity. Why, then, is unjust censure so much less
indifferent than unmerited praise? The answer is, that the pain of the one is so much more pungent than the pleasure of the
other. A man of sensibility is more humiliated by just censure than he is elevated by just applause. And it is much easier to
rid oneself by denial, of the slight pleasure of unmerited praise, than of the pain of unjust reproach. Though nobody doubts
any one's veracity when he disclaims some merit ascribed to him, it is at once doubted if he denies some crime which rumour
When we are perfectly satisfied with every part of our own conduct, the judgment of others is of less importance to us than
when we are in any doubt of the propriety of our actions; and the opinion of others, their approbation or the contrary, is a
most serious matter to us, when we are uneasy as to the justice of our resentment or the propriety of any other passion. And,
as a rule, the agreement or disagreement of the judgments of other people with our own varies in importance for us exactly
in proportion to the uncertainty we feel of the propriety or accuracy of our own sentiments or judgments. Hence it is that
poets and authors are so much more anxious about public opinion than mathematicians or men of science. The discoveries of
the latter, admitting by nature of nearly perfect proof, render the opinion of the public a matter of indifference; but in the fine
arts, where excellence can only be determined by a certain nicety of taste, and the decision is more uncertain, the favourable
judgments of friends and the public are as delightful as their unfavourable judgments are mortifying. The sensibility of poets
especially is due to this cause; and we may instance the sensibility of Racine, who used to tell his son that the most paltry
criticisms had always given him more pain than the highest eulogy had ever given him pleasure: or that of Gray, who was so
much hurt by a foolish parody of two of his finest odes, that he never afterwards attempted anything considerable. 
It may happen that the two principles of desiring praise and desiring praiseworthiness are blended together, and it must often
remain unknown to a man himself, and always to other people, how far he did a praiseworthy action for its own sake, or for
the love of praise; how far he desired to deserve, or only to obtain, the approbation of others. There are very few men who
are satisfied with their own consciousness of having attained those qualities, or performed those actions, which they think
praiseworthy in others, and who do not wish their consciousness of praiseworthiness to be corroborated by the actual praise
of other men. Some men care more for the actual praise, others for the real praiseworthiness. It is therefore needless to
agree with those "splenetic philosophers" (Mandeville is intended) who impute to the love of praise, or what they call vanity,
From this distinction between our desire for praise and our desire for praiseworthiness, Adam Smith arrives at the result,
that there are, so to speak, two distinct tribunals of morality. The approbation or disapprobation of mankind is the first
source of personal self-approbation or the contrary. But though man has been thus constituted the immediate judge of
mankind, he has been made so only in the first instance: "and an appeal lies from his sentence to a much higher tribunal, to
the tribunal of their own consciences, to that of the supposed impartial and well-informed spectator, to that of the man
within the breast, the great judge and arbiter of their conduct." Two sorts of approbation are thus supposed, that of the
ordinary spectator, and that of the well-informed one; or, as it may be otherwise put, of the man without and the man within
the breast. Whilst the jurisdiction of the former is founded altogether in the desire of actual praise, and the aversion to actual
blame, that of the latter is founded altogether in the desire of really possessing those qualities, or performing those actions
which we love and admire in other people, and in avoiding those qualities and those actions which, in other people, arouse
If Conscience, then, which may be defined as "the testimony of the supposed impartial spectator of the breast:," originates in
the way described, whence has it that very great influence and authority which belong to it? and how does it happen that it is
only by consulting it that we can see what relates to ourselves in its true light, or make any proper comparison between our
The answer is, By our power of assuming in imagination another situation. It is with the eye of the mind as with the eye of
the body. Just as a large landscape seems smaller than the window which looks out on it, and we only learn by habit and
experience to judge of the relative magnitude of objects by transporting ourselves in imagination to a different station, from
whence we can judge of their real proportions, so it is necessary for the mind to change its position before we can ever
regard our own selfish interests in their due relation to the interests of others. We have to view our interests and another's,
"neither from our own place nor from his, neither with our own eyes nor yet with his, but from the place and with the eyes
of a third person, who has no particular connexion with either, and who judges with impartiality between us." By habit and
experience we come to do this so easily, that the mental process is scarcely perceptible to us, by Which we correct the
natural inequality of our sentiments. We learn both the moral lesson, and the lesson in vision, so thoroughly, as no longer to
"It is reason, principle, conscience, the inhabitant of the breast, the man within, the great judge and arbiter of our conduct,"
who alone can correct the natural misrepresentations of self-love, who shows us the propriety of generosity and the
deformity of injustice, the propriety of resigning our own greatest interests for the yet greater interests of others, and the
deformity of doing the smallest injury to another in order to obtain the greatest benefit to ourselves. But for this correction
of self-love by conscience, the destruction of the empire of China by an earthquake wou1d disturb a man's sleep less than the
loss of his own little finger, and to prevent so paltry a misfortune to himself he would be willing to sacrifice the lives of a
hundred millions of his brethren, pro- vided he had never seen them. It is not the love of our neighbour, still less the love of
mankind, which would ever prompt us to self-sacrifice. It is a stronger love, a more powerful affection, "the love of what is
The sense of duty in its various forms is the result of the commands of conscience, which thus exists within us as the
reflection of external approbation. When the happiness or misery of others depends on our conduct, conscience, or "the man
within," immediately calls to us that if we prefer our- selves to them, or the interest of one to the interest of many, we render
The control of our passive feelings, of our natural preference for our own interests and our natural indifference to those of
others, can only be acquired by a regard to the sentiments of the real or supposed spectator of our conduct. This is the
discipline ordained by nature for the acquisition of the virtue of self-command as well as of all other virtues. The whole of
life is an education in the acquisition of self-command. A child, as soon as it mixes with its equals at school, wishes naturally
to gain their favour and avoid their contempt; and it is taught by a regard to its own safety to moderate its anger and other
passions to the degree with which its play-fellows are likely to be pleased. From that time forth, the exercise of discipline
Only the man who has been thoroughly bred in the great school of self-command, the bustle and business of the world,
maintains perfect control over his passive feelings upon all occasions. He has never dared to forget for one moment the
judgment likely to be passed by the impartial spectator upon his sentiments and conduct, nor suffered the man within the
breast to be absent for one moment from his attention. With the eyes of this great inmate he has been accustomed to regard
all that relates to himself. From his having been under the constant necessity of moulding, or trying to mould, his conduct
and feelings in accordance with those of this spectator, the habit has become perfectly familiar to him; and he almost
identifies himself with, he almost becomes himself that impartial spectator; he hardly ever feels but as that great arbiter of his
But with most men conscience, which is founded on the approbation of an imaginary spectator, requires often to be aroused
by contact with a real one. "The man within the breast, the abstract and ideal spectator of our sentiments and conduct,
requires often to be awakened and put in mind of his duty by the presence of the real spectator." In other words, conscience
requires to be kept fresh by contact with the world; solitude leads us to overrate the good actions we may have done or the
injuries we may have suffered, and causes us to be too much dejected in adversity as well as too much elated in prosperity. 
Nevertheless if the actual spectator is not impartial like the distant one of imagination or reality, the rectitude of our
judgments concerning our own conduct is liable to be much perverted; and this fact accounts for many anomalies of our
Take, for instance, the conduct of two different nations to one another. Neutral nations, the only indifferent and impartial
spectators of their conduct, are so far off as to be almost out of sight. The citizen of either nation pays little regard to the
sentiments of foreign countries, but only seeks to obtain the approbation of his own fellow-citizens, which he can never do
better than by enraging and offending the enemies they have in common. Thus the partial spectator is at hand, the impartial
one at a distance. Hence the total disregard in the life of nations of the rules of morality in force in private life. "In war and
negotiation the laws of justice are very seldom observed. Truth and fair dealing are almost totally disregarded. Treaties are
violated; and the violation, if some advantage is gained by it, sheds scarce any dishonour upon the violator. The ambassador
who dupes the minister of a foreign nation is admired and applauded." The same conduct which in private transactions
would make a man beloved and esteemed, in public transactions would load him with contempt and detestation. Not only
are the laws of nations violated without dishonour, but they are themselves laid down with very little regard to the plainest
rules of justice. It is in the most perfect conformity with what are called the laws of nations that the goods of peaceable
citizens should be liable to seizure on land and sea, that their lands should be laid waste, their homes burnt, and they
Nor is the conduct of hostile parties, civil or ecclesiastical, more restrained by the power of conscience than that of hostile
nations to one another. The laws of faction pay even less regard to the rules of justice than the laws of nations do. Though it
has never been doubted whether faith ought to be kept with public enemies, it has often been furiously debated whether faith
ought to be kept with rebels and heretics. Yet rebels and heretics are only those who, when things have come to a certain
degree of violence, have the misfortune to belong to the weaker party. The impartial spectator is never at a greater distance
than amidst the rage and violence of contending parties. For them it may be said that "such a spectator scarce exists
anywhere in the universe. Even to the great judge of the universe they impute all their own prejudices, and often view that

This is the explanation of the moral phenomenon of self-deceit, and accounts for the otherwise remarkable fact, that our
conscience in spite of its great authority and the great sanctions by which its voice is enforced, is so often prevented from
acting with efficacy. When we are about to act, the eagerness of passion seldom allows us to consider what we are doing
with the candour of an indifferent person. Our view of things is discoloured, even when we try to place ourselves in the
situation of another and to regard our own interests from his point of view. We are constantly forced back by the fury of our
passions to our own position, where everything seems magnified and misrepresented by self-love, whilst we catch but
When we have acted, we can indeed enter more coolly into the sentiments of the indifferent spectator, and regard our own
actions with his impartiality. We are then able to identify ourselves with the ideal man within the breast and view in our own
character our own conduct and situation with the severe eyes of the most impartial spectator. But even our judgment is
seldom quite candid. It is so disagreeable to think ill of ourselves, that we often purposely turn away our view from those
circumstances which might render our judgment unfavourable. Rather than see our own behaviour in a disagreeable light, we
often endeavour to exasperate anew those unjust passions which at first misled us; we awaken artificially our old hatreds and
irritate afresh our almost forgotten resentments; and we thus persevere in injustice merely because we were unjust, and

Continual observations on the conduct of others lead us gradually to form to ourselves certain general rules as to what it is
fit and proper to do or to avoid. If some of their actions shock all our natural sentiments, and we hear other people express
like detestation of them, we are then satisfied that we view them aright. We resolve therefore never to be guilty of the like
offences, nor to make ourselves the objects of the general disapprobation they incur. Thus we arrive at a general rule, that all
such actions are to be avoided, as tending to make us odious, contemptible, or punishable. Other actions, on the contrary,
call forth our approbation, and the expressions of the same approval by others confirm us in the justice of our opinion. The
eagerness of everybody to honour and re- ward them excite in us all those sentiments for which we have by nature the
strongest desirethe love, the gratitude, the admiration of mankind. We thus become ambitious of per- forming the like, and
These general rules of morality, therefore, are ultimately founded on experience of what, in particular instances, our moral
faculties approve of or condemn. They are not moral intuitions, or major premisses of conduct supplied to us by nature. We
do not start with a general rule, and approve or disapprove of particular actions according as they conform or not to this
general rule, but we form the general rule from experience of the approval or disapproval bestowed on particular actions. At
the first sight of an inhuman murder, detestation of the crime would arise, irrespective of a reflection; that one of the most
sacred rules of conduct prohibited the taking away another man's life, that this particular murder was a violation of that rule,
and consequently that it was blameworthy. The detestation would arise instantaneously, and antecedent to our formation of
any such general rule. The general rule would be formed afterwards upon the detestation we felt at such an action, at the
So when we read in history or elsewhere of either generous or base actions, our admiration for the one and our contempt for
the other does not arise from the consideration that there are certain general rules which declare all actions of the one kind
admirable and all of the other contemptible. Those rules are all formed from our experience of the effects naturally produced

When once these moral principles, or general rules, have been formed, and established by the concurrent voice of all
mankind, they are often appealed to as the standards of judgment, when we seek to apportion their due degree of praise or
blame to particular actions. From their being cited on all such occasions as the ultimate foundations of what is just and
unjust, many eminent authors have been misled, and have drawn up their systems as if they supposed "that the original
judgments of mankind, with regard to right and wrong, were formed, like the decisions of a court of judicatory, by
considering first the general rule, and then, secondly, whether the particular action under consideration fell properly within
To pass now from the formation of such general rules to their function in practical ethics. They are most useful in correcting
the misrepresentations of things which self-love is ever ready to suggest to us. Though founded on experience, they are none
the less girt round with a sacred and unimpeachable authority. Take a man inclined to furious resentment, and ready to think
that the death of his enemy is a small compensation for his provocation. From his observations on the conduct of others he
has learned how horrible such revenges always appear, and has formed to himself a general rule, to abstain from them on all
occasions. This rule preserves its authority with him under his temptation, when he might otherwise believe that his fury was
just, and such as every impartial spectator would approve. The reverence for the rule, impressed upon him by past
experience, checks the impetuosity of his passion, and helps him to correct the too partial views which self-love might
suggest as proper in his situation. Even should he after all give way to his passion, he is terrified, at the moment of so doing,
by the thought that he is violating a rule which he has never seen infringed without the strongest expressions of
That sense of duty, that feeling of the obligatoriness of the rules of morality, which is so important a principle in human life,
and the only principle capable of governing the bulk of mankind, is none other than an acquired reverence for these general
principles of conduct, arrived at in the manner described. This acquired reverence often serves as a substitute for the sense
of the propriety or impropriety of a particular course of conduct. For many men live through their lives without ever
incurring much blame, who yet may never feel the sentiment upon which our approbation of their conduct is founded, but
act merely from a regard for what they see are the established rules of behaviour. For instance, a man who has received great
benefits from another may feel very little gratitude in his heart, and yet act in every way as if he did so, without any selfish or
blameable motive, but simply from reverence for the established rule of duty. Or a wife, who may not feel any tender regard
for her husband, may also act as if she did, from mere regard to a sense of the duty of such conduct. And though such a
friend or such a wife are doubt- less not the best of their kind, they are perhaps the second best, and will be restrained from
any decided dereliction from their duty. Though "the coarse clay of which the bulk of mankind are formed, cannot be
wrought to such perfection's as to act on all occasions with the most delicate propriety, there is scarcely anybody who may
not by education, discipline, and example, be so impressed with a regard to general rules of conduct, as to act nearly always
with tolerable decency, and to avoid through the whole of his life any considerable degree of blame. 
Were it not indeed for this sense of duty, this sacred regard for general rules, there is no one on whose conduct much
reliance could be placed. The difference between a man of principle and a worthless fellow is chiefly the difference between
a man who adheres resolutely to his maxims of conduct aud the man who acts "variously and accidentally as humour,
inclination, or interest chance to be uppermost." Even the duties of ordinary politeness, which are not difficult to ob- serve,
depend very often for their observance more on regard for the general rule than on the actual feeling of the moment; and if
these slight duties would, without such regard, be so readily violated, how slight, without a similar regard, would be the
observance of the duties of justice, truth, fidelity, and chastity, for the violation of which so many strong motives might
The obligatoriness of the rules of morality being thus first impressed upon us by nature, and afterwards confirmed by
reasoning and philosophy, comes to be still further enhanced by the consideration that the said rules are the laws of God,
For whatever theory we may prefer of the origin of our moral faculties, there can be no doubt, Adam Smith argues, but "that
they were given us for the direction of our conduct in this life." Our moral faculties "carry along with them the most evident
badges of this authority, which denote that they were set up within us to be the supreme arbiters of all our actions, to
superintend all our senses, passions, and appetites, and to judge how far each of them was either to be indulged or
restrained." Our moral faculties are not on a level in this respect with the other faculties and appetites of our nature, for no
other faculty or principle of action judges of any other. Love, for instance, does not judge of love, nor resentment of
resentment. These two passions may be opposite to one another, but they do not approve or disapprove of one another. It
belongs to our moral faculties to judge in this way of the other principles of our nature. What is agreeable to our moral
faculties is fit, and right, and proper to be done; what is disagreeable to them is the contrary. The sentiments which they
approve of are graceful and becoming; the contrary ungraceful and unbecoming. The very wordsright, wrong, fit, improper,
Since, then, they "were plainly intended to be the governing principles of human nature, the rules which they prescribe are to
be regarded as the commands and laws of the Deity, promulgated by those vicegerents which He has thus set up within us."
These "vicegerents of God within us" never fail to punish the violation of the rules of morality by the torments of inward
shame and self-condemnation, whilst they always reward obedience to them with tranquillity and self- satisfaction. 
Having thus added the force of a religious sanction to the authority of moral rules, and accounted for the feeling of
obligation in morality, from the physical basis of the pain or pleasure of an instinctive antipathy or sympathy, the philosopher
arrives at the question, How far our actions ought to arise chiefly or entirely from a sense of duty or a regard to general
rules, and how far any other sentiment ought to concur and have a principal influence. If a mere regard for duty is the motive
First, it depends on the natural agreeableness or deformity of the affection of the mind which prompts us to any action,
whether the action should proceed rather from that affection than from a regard to the general rule. Actions to which the
social or benevolent affections prompt us should proceed as much from the affections or passions themselves as from any
regard to the general rules of conduct. To repay a kindness from a cold sense of duty, and from no personal affection to
one's benefactor, is scarcely pleasing to the latter. As a father may justly complain of a son, who, though he fail in none of
the offices of filial duty, yet manifests no affectionate reverence for his parent, so a son expects from his father something
The contrary maxim applies to the malevolent and unsocial passions. If we ought to reward from gratitude and generosity,
without any reflections on the propriety of rewarding, we ought always to punish with reluctance, and more from a sense of
Where the selfish passions are concerned, we should attend to general rules in the pursuit of the lesser objects of private
interest, but feel more passion for the objects themselves when they are of transcendent importance to us. The parsimony,
for instance, of a tradesman should not proceed from a desire of the particular threepence he will save by it to-day, nor his
attendance in his shop from a passion for the particular tenpence he will gain by it, but from a regard to the general rule
which prescribes severe economy as the guiding principle of his life. To be anxious, or to lay a plot to gain or save a single
shilling, would degrade him in the eyes of all his neighbours. But the more important objects of self-interest should be
pursued with more concern for the thing's themselves and for their own sake; and a man would justly be regarded as
mean-spirited who cared nothing about his election to Parliament or about the conquest of a province. 
Secondly, it depends upon the exactness or inexactness of the general rules themselves, how far our conduct ought to
The general rules of almost all the virtues, which determine what are the duties of prudence, charity, generosity, gratitude,
or friendship, admit of so many modifications and exceptions, that it is hardly possible to regulate our conduct entirely from
regard to them. Even the rule of gratitude, plain as it seems to be, that it behoves us to make a return of equal, or, if
possible, superior value to the benefit received from another, gives rise to numberless questions, whenever we seek to apply
it to particular cases. For instance, if your friend lent you money in your distress, ought you to lend him money in his? and, if
so, how much? and when? and for how long a time? No definite answer can be given to such questions. And even still more
Justice, indeed, is the only virtue of which the general rules determine exactly every external action required by it. If, for
instance, you owe a man ten pounds, justice requires that you should pay him precisely that sum. The whole nature of your
action is prescribed and fixed. The most sacred regard, therefore, is due to the rules of justice, and the actions it requires are
never more properly performed than from a regard to the general rules themselves. In the practice of the other virtues, our
conduct should be directed rather by a certain idea of propriety, by a certain taste for a particular kind of behaviour, than by
any regard to a precise rule or maxim; and we should consider more the end and foundation of the rule than the rule itself.
But it is otherwise with justice, where we should attend more to the rule itself than to its end. Though the end of the rules of
justice is to hinder us from hurting our neighbour, it would still be a crime to violate them, although we might pretend, with
The rules of justice, and those of the other virtues, may therefore be compared in this way. The rules of justice are like the
rules of grammar, those of the other virtues like the rules laid down by critics for the attainment of elegance in composition.
Whilst the former are precise and accurate, the latter are vague and indeterminate, and present us rather with a general idea
of perfection to be aimed at than any certain directions for acquiring it. As a man may be taught to write grammatically by
rule, so perhaps may he be taught to act justly. But as there are no rules which will lead a man infallibly to elegance in
composition, so there are none by which we can be taught to act on all occasions with prudence, magnanimity, or
Lastly, in reference to moral principles, may be considered the case of their liability to perversion by a mistaken idea of them.
There may be a most earnest desire so to act as to deserve approbation, and yet an erroneous conscience or a wrong sense
of duty may lead to a course of conduct with which it is impossible for mankind to sympathize. "False notions of religion are
almost the only causes which can occasion any very gross perversion of our natural sentiments in this way; and that principle
which gives the greatest authority to the rules of duty, is alone capable of distorting them in any considerable degree. In all
other cases common sense is sufficient to direct us, if not to the most exquisite propriety of conduct, yet to something which
is not very far from it; and, provided we are desirous in earnest to do well, our behaviour will always, upon the whole, be
praise-worthy." All men are agreed that the first rule of duty is to obey the will of God, but it is concerning the particular
commandments imposed by that will that they differ so widely; and crimes committed from a sense of religious duty are not
regarded with the indignation felt for ordinary crimes. The sorrow we feel for Seid and Palmira in Voltaire's play of
Mahomet, when they are driven by a sense of religious duty to murder an old man whom they honoured and esteemed, is the
The relation which, in Adam Smith's system, religion bears to ethics has been already indicated in the last chapter. Although
he regards morality as quite independent of religion, as intelligible and possible without it, religion nevertheless stands out
visibly in the background of his theory, and is appealed to as a strong support of virtuous conduct, and as lending additional
These moral rules, though sufficiently sanctioned by the same feelings of human approbation or disapprobation which
originally gave rise to them, derive an additional sanction from natural religion. It was too important for the happiness of
mankind, that the natural sense of duty should thus be enforced by the terrors of religion, "for nature to leave it dependent
This identification therefore of the rules of morality with the rules of religion was first impressed upon mankind by nature,
and then afterwards confirmed by philosophy. Naturally led as men everywhere are, and were, to ascribe to those beings,
which in any country happen to be the objects of religious fear, all their own sentiments and passions, it could not but arise,
that as they ascribed to them those passions which do least honour to our own speciessuch as lust, avarice, envy, or
revengethey should also ascribe to them those qualities which are the great ornaments of humanitythe love of virtue and
beneficence, and the hatred of vice and injustice. The injured man would call on Jupiter to witness his wrong, never doubting
but that it would be beheld by him with the same indignation that would actuate the meanest of mankind against it; whilst the
man, who did the wrong, transferred to the same omnipresent and irresistible being the resentment he was also conscious of
in mankind. "These natural hopes, and fears, and suspicions, were propagated by sympathy, and confirmed by education; and
the gods were universally represented and believed to be the rewarders of humanity and mercy, and the avengers of perfidy
and injustice. And thus religion, even in its rudest form, gave a sanction to the rules of morality, long before the age of
Reasoning, when applied, confirmed the original anticipations of nature. For from the recognition of the fact, already
noticed, that our moral faculties were intended to be the governing principles of our nature, it became clear that the rules
they formulated, in compliance with such an intention, might be regarded as the laws of the Deity, who set up those moral
Another consideration confirms this reasoning. As by obeying the rules prescribed to us by our moral faculties, we pursue
the most effectual means for promoting the happiness of mankind, and as the happiness of mankind seems to be the original
purpose intended by the Author of Nature, it is evident that by obeying the moral rules we in some sense co- operate with
the Deity, and advance, as far as is in our power, the plan of Providence. As also by acting otherwise we obstruct in some
measure His scheme, we declare ourselves in some measure the enemies of God, so we are naturally encouraged to look for
Moreover, although virtue and vice, as far as they can be either rewarded or punished by the sentiments and opinions of
mankind, meet even here, according to the common course of things, with their deserts, we are compelled by the best
principles of our nature, by our love of virtue and our abhorrence of vice and injustice, to look to a future life for the
rectification of occasional results of virtue or vice which shock all our natural sentiments of justice. The indignation we feel
when we see violence and artifice prevail over sincerity and justice, the sorrow we feel for the sufferings of the innocent, the
resentment we feel and often cannot satisfy against the oppressor, all prompt us to hope "that the great Author of our nature
will Himself execute hereafter, what all the principles which He has given us for the direction of our conduct prompt us to
attempt even here; that He will complete the plan which He Himself has thus taught us to begin; and will, in a life to come,
When, therefore, the general rules of morality which determine the merit or demerit of actions come thus to be regarded,
says Adam Smith, as the laws of an all-powerful Being, who watches over our conduct, and who, in a life to come, will
reward the observance and punish the breach of them, they necessarily acquire a new sacredness. The sense of propriety,
which dictates obedience to the will of the Deity as the supreme rule of our conduct, is confirmed by the strongest motives
of self-interest. For it is an idea, well capable of restraining the most headstrong passions, that however much we may
escape the observation or the punishment of mankind, we can never escape the observation nor the punishment of God. 
It is on account of the additional sanction which religion thus confers upon the rules of morality that so great confidence is
generally placed in the probity of those who seem deeply impressed with a sense of religion. They seem to act under an
additional tie to those which regulate the conduct of others. For regard to the propriety of action and to reputation, regard
to the applause of his own breast as well as to that of others, are motives which have the same influence over the religious
man as over the man of the world; but the former acts under another restraint, that of future recompense, and accordingly
Nor is this greater trust unreasonably placed in him. For "wherever the natural principles of religion are not corrupted by the
factious and party zeal of some worthless cabal; wherever the first duty which it requires is to fulfil all the obligations of
morality; wherever men are not taught to regard frivolous observances as more immediate duties of religion than acts of
justice and beneficence; and to imagine, that by sacrifices, and ceremonies, and vain supplications, they can bargain with the
Deity for fraud, and perfidy, and violence, the world undoubtedly judges right in this respect, and justly places a double
At the same time Adam Smith resents strongly the doctrine that religious principles are the only laudable motives of action,
the doctrine, "that we ought neither to reward from gratitude nor punish from resentment, that we ought neither to protect
the helplessness of our children, nor afford support to the infirmities of our parents, from natural affection; but that we ought
to do all things from the love of the Deity, and from a desire only to render ourselves agreeable to Him, and to direct our
conduct according to His will." It should not be the sole motive and principle of our conduct in the performance of our
various duties that God has commanded us to perform them, though that it should be our ruling and governing principle is
In the same way that Adam Smith regards religion as an additional sanction to the natural rules of morality, does he regard it
as the only effectual consolation in the case of a man unjustly condemned by the world for a crime of which he is innocent.
To such an one, that humble philosophy which confines its view to this life can afford but little com- fort. Deprived of
everything that could make either life or death respectable, condemned to death and to everlasting infamy, the view of
another world, where his innocence will be declared and his virtue rewarded, can alone compensate him for the misery of his

This doctrine, Adam Smith thinks, could never have fallen into disrepute, had not a doctrine been asserted of a future
distribution of rewards and punishments, at total variance with all our moral sentiments. The preference of assiduous flattery
to merit or service, which is regarded as the greatest reproach even to the weakness of earthly sovereigns, is often ascribed
to divine perfection; "and the duties of devotion, the public and private worship of the Deity, have been represented, even by
men of virtue and abilities, as the sole virtues which can either entitle to reward, or exempt from punishment, in the life to
There is the same absurdity in the notion, which had even its advocate in a philosopher like Massillon, that one hour or day
spent in the mortifications of a monastery has more merit in the eye of God than a whole life spent honourably in the
profession of a soldier. Such a doctrine is surely contrary to all our moral sentiments, and the principles by which we have
been taught by nature to regulate our admiration or contempt. "It is this spirit, however, which, while it has reserved the
celestial regions for monks and friars, or for those whose conduct or conversation resembled those of monks and friars, has
condemned to the infernal all the heroes, all the statesmen and lawyers, all the poets and philosophers of former ages; all
those who have invented, improved, or excelled in the arts which contribute to the subsistence, to the conveniency, or to the
ornament of life; all the great protectors, instructors, and benefactors of mankind; all those to whom our natural sense of
praiseworthiness forces us to ascribe the highest merit and the most exalted virtue. Can we wonder that so strange an
application of this most respectable doctrine should sometimes have exposed it to derision and contempt?" 
Although, then, Adam Smith considers that reason corroborates the teaching of natural religion regarding the existence of
God and the life hereafter, he nowhere recognizes any moral obligation in the belief of one or the other; and they occupy in
his system a very similar position to that which they occupy in Kant's, who treats the belief in the existence of God and in
immortality as Postulates of the Practical Reason, that is to say, as assumptions morally necessary, however incapable of
speculative proof. Adam Smith, however, does not approach either subject at all from the speculative side, but confines
himself entirely to the moral basis of both, to the arguments in their favour which the moral phenomena of life afford, such
But besides the argument in favour of the existence of God derived from our moral sentiments, the only argument he
employs is derived, not from the logical inconceivability of a contrary belief, but from the incompatibility of such a contrary
belief with the happiness of the man so believing. A man of universal benevolence or boundless goodwill can enjoy no solid
happiness unless he is convinced that all the inhabitants of the universe are under the immediate care of that all-wise Being,
who directs all the movements of nature, and who is compelled, by His own unalterable perfections, to maintain in it at all
times the greatest possible quantity of happiness. To a man of universal benevolence, "the very suspicion of a fatherless
world must be the most melancholy of all reflections; from the thought that all the unknown regions of infinite and
incomprehensible space may be filled with nothing but endless misery and wretchedness. All the splendour of the highest
prosperity can never enlighten the gloom with which so dread- ful an idea must necessarily overshadow the imagination; nor,
in a wise and virtuous man, can all the sorrow of the most afflicting adversity ever dry up the joy which necessarily springs
It was a well-known doctrine of the Stoic philosophy, that a man should resign all his wishes and interests with perfect
confidence to the benevolent wisdom which directs the universe, and should seek his happiness chiefly in the contemplation
of the perfection of the universal system. With this conception of resignation Adam Smith very closely agrees, in his
description of the sentiments which become the wise and virtuous man with regard to his relation to the great sum of things.
Just as he should be willing to sacrifice his own interest to that of his own order, and that of his own order again to that of
his country, so he should be willing to sacrifice all those inferior interests "to the greater interest of the universe, to the
interest of that great society of all sensible and intelligent beings, of which God Himself is the immediate administrator and
director. If he is deeply impressed with the habitual and thorough conviction that this benevolent and all-wise Being can
admit into the system of His government no partial evil which is not necessary for the universal good, he must consider all
the misfortunes which may befall himself, his friends, his society, or his country, as necessary for the prosperity of the
universe, and therefore as what he ought not only to submit to with resignation, but as what he himself, if he had known all
A wise man should be capable of doing what a good soldier is always ready to do. For the latter, when ordered by his
general, will march with alacrity to the forlorn station, knowing that he would not have been sent there but for the safety of
the whole army and the success of the war, and he will cheerfully sacrifice his own little system to the welfare of a greater.
But "no conductor of an army can deserve more unlimited trust, more ardent and zealous affection, than the great Con-
ductor of the universe. In the greatest public as well as private disasters, a wise man ought to consider that he himself, his
friends and countrymen, have only been ordered upon the forlorn station of the universe; that had it not been necessary for
the good of the whole, they would not have been so ordered; and that it is their duty, not only with humble resignation to
To the question, how far a man should seek his highest happiness in the contemplation of the system of the universe; or, in
other words, whether the contemplative or the practical life is the higher and better, Adam Smith replies hesitatingly in
favour of the latter. The most sublime object of human contemplation is "the idea of that Divine Being, whose benevolence
and wisdom have from all eternity contrived and conducted the immense machine of the universe, so as at all times to
produce the greatest possible quantity of happiness." A man believed to be chiefly occupied in this sublime contemplation
seldom fails of the highest veneration; and even though his life should be altogether contemplative, is often regarded with a
sort of religious respect far higher than is generally bestowed on the most useful and active citizen. Marcus Antoninus has,
perhaps, received more admiration for his meditations on this subject than for all the different transactions of his just and
Nevertheless, the care of the universe not being the concern of man, but only the care of his own happiness, or that of his
family, friends, or country, he can never be justified in neglecting the more humble department of affairs because he is
engaged in the contemplation of the higher. He must not lay himself open to the charge which was brought against Marcus
Antoninus, that whilst he was occupied in contemplating the prosperity of the universe lie neglected that of the Roman
empire. "The most sublime speculation of the contemplative philosopher can scarce compensate the neglect of the smallest
The science of ethics, according to Adam Smith, deals mainly with two principal questions, the first concerning the nature of
moral approbation, or the origin of our feelings of right and wrong, and the second concerning the nature of virtue, or the
moral elements of which virtue consists. The first question is that to which the answer has already been given; the second
question to which the answer yet remains to be given, is "What is the tone of temper, and tenor of conduct, which
constitutes the excellent and praiseworthy character, the character which is the natural object of esteem, honour, and
approbation?" Does virtue consist in benevolence, as some have maintained, or is it but a form of self-love, as others have
maintained; or does it consist in some relation of the benevolent and selfish affections to one another? 
The general answer which Adam Smith makes to this question is, that virtue consists in a certain relation to one another of
our selfish and unselfish affections, not exclusively in a predominance of either of them. "The man of the most perfect
virtue," he says, "the man whom we naturally love and revere the most, is he who joins, to the most perfect command of his
own original and selfish feelings, the most exquisite sensibility both to the original and sympathetic feelings of others." It is
the man who unites the gentler virtues of humanity and sensibility with the severer virtues of self-control and self-denial. "To
feel much for others, and little for ourselves, to restrain our selfish, and to indulge our benevolent affections, constitutes the
Consequently any man's character for virtue must depend upon those two different aspects of his conduct which regard both
himself and others; and a character completely virtuous will consist in a combination of those qualities which have a
beneficial effect alike on an individual's own happiness as on that of his fellow-men. These qualities are Prudence, Justice

the care of his personal health, fortune, rank, and reputation. The first lessons in this virtue are taught us "by the voice of
nature herself," who directs us by the appetites of hunger and thirst, and by agreeable or disagreeable sensations, to provide
for our bodily preservation and health. As we grow older we learn that only by proper care and foresight with respect to our
external fortune can we ensure the means of satisfying our natural appetites, and we are further led to a desire of the
advantages of fortune by experience, that chiefly on their possession or supposed possession depends that credit and rank
among our equals which is perhaps the strongest of all our desires. Security therefore of health, fortune, and rank,
This outline of the subject-matter of Prudence, Adam Smith proceeds to fill up with a sketch of the character of the Prudent
Man, which modelled, as it appears to be, on Aristotle's delineation of imaginary types of the different virtues, is so
characteristic an illustration of our author's style and thought, that it is best presented to the reader in the following extracts
"The prudent man always studies seriously and earnestly to understand whatever he professes to understand and not merely
to persuade other people that he understands it; and though his talents may not always be very brilliant, they are always
perfectly genuine. He neither endeavours to impose upon you by the cunning devices of an artful impostor, nor by the
arrogant airs of an assuming pedant, nor by the confident assertions of a superficial and impudent pretender; he is not
ostentatious even of the abilities he really possesses. His conversation is simple and modest, and he is averse to all the
"The prudent man is always sincere, and feels horror at the very thought of exposing himself to the disgrace which attends
upon the detection of falsehood. But though always sincere, he is not always frank and open; and though he never tells
anything but the truth, he does not always think himself bound, when not properly called upon, to tell the whole truth. As he
is cautious in his actions, so he is reserved in his speech, and never rashly or unnecessarily obtrudes his opinion concerning
"The prudent man, though not always distinguished by the most exquisite sensibility, is always very capable of friendship.
But his friendship is not that ardent and passionate but too often transitory affection which appears so delicious to the
generosity of youth and inexperience. It is a sedate, but steady and faithful attachment to a few well-chosen companions; in
the choice of whom he is not guided by the giddy admiration of shining accomplishments, but by the sober esteem of
modesty, discretion, and good conduct. But though capable of friendship, he is not always much disposed to general
sociality. He rarely frequents, and more rarely figures in, those convivial societies which are distinguished for the jollity and
gaiety of their conversation. Their way of life might too often interfere with the regularity of his temperance, might interrupt
"But though his conversation may not always be very sprightly or diverting, it is always perfectly inoffensive. He hates the
thought of being guilty of any petulance or rudeness; he never assumes impertinently over anybody, and upon all occasions
is willing to place himself rather below than above his equals. Both in his conduct and conversation he is an exact observer
of decency, and respects with an almost religious scrupulosity all the established decorums and ceremonials of society..... 
"The man who lives within his income is naturally con- tented with his situation, which by continual though small
accumulations is growing better and better every day. He is enabled gradually to relax both in the rigour of his parsimony
and in the severity of his application;..... He  has no anxiety to change so comfortable a situation, and does not go in quest of
new enterprises  and adventures which might endanger, but could not well increase, the secure tranquillity which  he actually
enjoys. If he enters into any new projects, they are likely to be well concerted and well  prepared. He can never be hurried or
driven into them by any necessity, but has always time and leisure to deliberate soberly and coolly concerning what are likely
"The prudent man is not willing to subject himself to any responsibility which his duty does not impose upon him. He is not a
bustler in business where he has no concern; is not a meddler in other people's affairs; is not a professed counsellor or
adviser, who obtrudes his advice where nobody is asking it; he confines himself as much as his duty will permit to his own
affairs, and has no taste for that foolish importance which many people wish to derive from appearing to have some
influence in the management of those of other people; he is averse to enter into any party disputes, hates faction, and is not
always very forward to listen to the voice even of noble and great ambition. When distinctly called upon he will not decline
the service of his country; but he will not cabal in order to force himself into it, and would be much better pleased that the
public business were well managed by some other person than that he himself should have the trouble and incur the
responsibility of managing it. In the bottom of his heart he would prefer the undisturbed enjoyment of secure tranquillity, not
only to all the vain splendour of successful ambition, but to the real and solid glory of performing the greatest and most
Such is Adam Smith's account of the character of the Prudent Man, a character which he himself admits commands rather a
cold esteem than any very ardent love or admiration. He distinguishes it from that higher form of prudence which belongs to
the great general, statesman, or legislator, and which is the application of wise and judicious conduct to greater and nobler
purposes than the mere objects of personal interest. This superior prudence necessarily supposes the utmost perfection of all
the intellectual and all the moral virtues; it is the most perfect wisdom combined with the most perfect virtue; it is the best
2. Justice and Benevolencethe disposition either to refrain from injuring our neighbour, or else to benefit himare the two
qualities of a virtuous character which affect the happiness of other people. A sacred and religious regard not to hurt or
disturb the happiness of others, even in cases where no law can protect them, constitutes the character of the perfectly
innocent and just man, and is a character which can scarcely fail to be accompanied by many other virtues, such as great
feeling for others, great humanity, and great benevolence. But whilst benevolence is a positive moral factor, justice is only a
3. Benevolence comprises all the good offices which we owe to our family, our friends, our country, and our fellow-
creatures. This is the order in which the world is recommended to our beneficent affections by Nature, who has strictly
proportioned the strength of our benevolence to the degree in which it is necessary or likely to be useful. 
Thus every man is first and principally recommended to his own care, being better able to take care of himself than of any
other person. After himself, the members of his own family, those who usually live in the same house with him his parents,
children, or brothers and sistersare naturally the objects of his warmest affections. The earliest friendships are those among
brothers and sisters, whose power for giving pleasure or pain to one another renders their good agreement so much the
more necessary for the happiness of the family. The sympathy between more distant relations, being less necessary, is
Here, again, may be noticed the influence of custom over our moral sentiments. Affection is really habitual sympathy; and,
from our general experience that the state of habitual sympathy in which near relations stand to one another pro- duces a
certain affection between them, we expect always to find such affection, and are shocked when we fail to do so. Hence the
general rule is established, from a great number of instances, that persons related to one another in a certain degree ought to
be affected towards one another in a certain manner, and that the highest impropriety exists in the absence of any such
This disposition to accommodate and assimilate our sentiments and principles to those of persons we live with or see oftena
disposition which arises from the obvious convenience of such a general agreementleads us to expect to find friend- ship
subsisting between colleagues in office, partners in trade, or even between persons living in the same neighbourhood. There
are certain small good offices which are universally regarded as due to a neighbour in preference to any other person; and a
certain friendliness is expected of neighbours, from the mere fact of the sympathy naturally associated with living in the same
But these sort of attachments, which the Romans expressed by the word necessitudo as if to denote that they arose from the
necessity of the situation, are inferior to those friendships which are founded not merely on a sympathy, rendered habitual
for the sake of convenience, but on a natural sympathy and approbation of a man's good conduct. Such friendship can
subsist only among the good. "Men of virtue only can feel that entire confidence in the conduct and behaviour of one
another, which can at all times assure them that they can never either offend or be offended by one another. Vice is always
capricious, virtue only is regular and orderly. The attachment which is founded upon the love of virtue, as it is certainly of all
attachments the most virtuous, so it is likewise the happiest, as well as the most permanent and secure. Such friendships
need not be confined to a single person, but may safely embrace all the wise and virtuous with whom we have been long and
intimately acquainted, and upon whose wisdom and virtue we can, upon that account, entirely depend." 
And the same principles which direct the order of our benevolent affections towards individuals, likewise direct their order
towards societies, recommending to them before all others those to which they can be of most importance. Our native
country is the largest society upon which our good or bad conduct can have much influence. It is that to which alone our
good-will can be directed with effect. Accordingly, it is by nature most strongly recommended to us, as comprehending not
only our own personal safety and prosperity, but that of our children, our parents, our relations, and friends. It is thus
endeared to us by all our private benevolent, as well as by our selfish affections. Hence its prosperity and glory seem to
reflect some sort of honour upon ourselves, and "when we compare it with other societies of the same kind, we are proud of
But it is necessary to distinguish the love of our own country from a foolish dislike to every other one. "The love of our own
nation often disposes us to view, with the most malignant jealousy and envy, the prosperity and aggrandizement of any other
neighbouring nation. Independent and neighbouring nations, having no common superior to decide their disputes, all live in
continual dread and suspicion of one another. Each sovereign, expecting little justice from his neighbours, is disposed to
treat them with as little as he expects from them. The regard for the laws of nations, or for those rules which independent
states profess or pretend to think themselves bound to observe in their dealings with one another, is often very little more
than mere pretence and profession. From the smallest interest, upon the slightest provocation, we see those rules every day
either evaded or directly violated without shame or remorse. Each nation foresees, or imagines it foresees, its own
subjugation in the increasing power and aggrandizement of any of its neighbours; and the mean principle of national
prejudice is often founded on the noble one of the love of our own country. ...... France and England may each of them have
some reason to dread the increase of the naval and military power of the other; but for either of them to envy the internal
happiness `and prosperity of the other, the cultivation of its lands, the advancement of its manufactures, the increase of its
commerce, the security and number of its ports and harbours, its proficiency in all the liberal arts and sciences, is surely
beneath the dignity of two such great nations. These are the real improvements of the world we live in. Mankind are
benefited, human nature is ennobled by them. In such improvements each nation ought not only to endeavour itself to excel,
but, from the love of mankind, to promote, instead of obstructing, the excellence of its neighbours. These are all proper
This passage is of interest as coming from the future author of the Wealth of Nations the future founder of the doctrine of
free trade; and of historical interest, as reflecting cultivated opinion at a time when England was just in the middle of the
Seven years' war, is the remark that the most extensive public benevolence is that of the statesmen who project or form
alliances between neighbouring or not very distant nations, "for the preservation either of what is called the balance of
power, or of the general peace and tranquillity of the states within the circle of their negotiations." 
But the ordinary love of our country involves two things: a certain reverence for the form of government actually
established, and an earnest desire to render the condition of our fellow-citizens as safe, respectable, and happy, as possible.
It is only in times of public discontent and faction that these two principles may draw different ways, and lead to doubt
whether a change in the constitution might not be most conducive to the general happiness. In such times, the leaders of the
discontented party often propose "to new-model the constitution, and to alter, in some of its most essential parts, that
system of government under which the subjects of a great empire have enjoyed perhaps peace, security, and even glory,
during the course of several centuries together." And it may require the highest effort of political wisdom to determine when
a real patriot ought to support and try to re-establish the authority of the old system, and when he ought to give way to the
Nothing, indeed, is more fatal to the good order of society than the policy of "a man of system," who is so enamoured of his
own ideal plan of government as to be unable to suffer the smallest deviation from any part of it, and who insists upon
establishing and establishing all at once, and in spite of all opposition, whatever his idea may seem to require. Such a man
erects his own judgment into the supreme standard of right and wrong, and fancies himself the only wise and worthy man in
the commonwealth. "It is upon this account that of all political speculators sovereign princes are by far the most dangerous.
This arrogance is perfectly familiar to them. They entertain no doubt of the immense superiority of their own judgment . . . .
It is otherwise with the real patriot, with the man whose public spirit is prompted altogether by humanity and benevolence.
He "will respect the established powers and privileges even of individuals, and still more those of the great orders and
societies into which the state is divided. Though he should consider some of them as in some measure abusive, he will
content himself with moderating, what he often cannot annihilate without great violence. When he cannot conquer the
rooted prejudices of the people by reason and persuasion, he will not attempt to subdue them by force, but will religiously
observe what by Cicero is justly called the divine maxim of Plato, never to use violence to his country, no more than to his
parents. He will accommodate, as well as he can, his public arrangements to the confirmed habits and prejudices of the
people; and will remedy, as well as he can, the inconveniences which may flow from the want of those regulations which the
people are adverse to submit to. When he cannot establish the right, he will not disdain to ameliorate the wrong; but, like
Solon, where he cannot establish the best system of laws, he will endeavour to establish the best that the people can bear." 
But although Prudence, Justice, and Benevolence comprise all the qualities and actions which go to make up the highest
Virtue, another quality, that of Self-Command, is also necessary, in order that we may not be misled by our own passions to
violate the rules of the other three virtues. The most perfect knowledge, unless supported by the most perfect self-command,
The two sets of passions which it is necessary to command are those which, like fear and anger, it is difficult to control even
for a moment, or those which, like the love of ease, pleasure, applause, or other selfish gratifications, may be restrained
indeed often for a moment, but often prevail in the long run, by reason of their continual solicitations. The command of the
first set of passions constitutes what the ancient moralists denominated fortitude, or strength of mind; that of the other set
Self-command therefore is a union of the qualities of fortitude and temperance; and independently of the beauty it derives
from utility, as enabling us to act according to the dictates of prudence, justice, and benevolence, it has a beauty of its own,
For self-command is not only itself a great virtue, but it is the chief source of the lustre of all the other virtues. Thus the
character of the most exalted wisdom and virtue is that of a man who acts with the greatest coolness in extreme dangers and
difficulties, who observes religiously the sacred rules of justice, in spite of the temptation by his strongest interests or by the
grossest injuries to violate them, and who suffers not the benevolence of his temper to be damped by the ingratitude of its
The first quality in the character of self-command is Courage or the restraint of the passion of fear. The command of fear is
more admirable than that of anger. The exertion displayed by a man, who in persecution or danger suffers no word or
gesture to escape him, which does not perfectly accord with the feelings of the most indifferent spectator, commands a high
degree of admiration. Had Socrates been suffered to die quietly in his bed, even his glory as a philosopher might never have
attained that dazzling splendour which has ever been attached to him. Courage even causes some degree of regard to be paid
to the greatest criminals who die with firm- ness; and the freedom from the fear of death, the great fear of all, is that which
ennobles the profession of a soldier, and bestows upon it a rank and dignity superior to that of every other profession. It is
for this reason that some sort of esteem is attached to characters, however worthless, who have conducted with success a
great warlike exploit, though under- taken contrary to every principle of justice, and. carried on with no regard to humanity. 
The command of the passion of anger, though it has no special name like that of the passion of fear, merits on many
occasions much admiration. But whilst courage is always admired irrespective of its motive, our approval of the command
of anger depends on our sense of its dignity and propriety. Our whole sense of the beauty of the Philippics of Demosthenes
or of the Catiline orations of Cicero is derived from the propriety with which a just indignation is express ed in them. This
just indignation is nothing but anger re- strained to that degree with which the impartial spectator can sympathize. It is
because a blustering and noisy anger interests the spectator less for the angry man than for the person with whom lie is angry
that the nobleness of pardoning so often appears superior to the most perfect propriety of resentment. But the fact that the
restraint of anger may be due to the presence of fear accounts for the less general admiration that is paid to the former than
is often paid to the latter. The indulgence of anger seems to show a sort of courage and superiority to fear, and for that
reason it is some- times an object of vanity, whilst the indulgence of fear is never an object of a similar ostentation. 
The next quality in Self-Command is Temperance, or the command of those less violent passions which appeal to our love
of ease or pleasure. The command of these passions can seldom, like the command of anger or fear, be directed to any bad
end. Temperance and moderation, which include such virtues as industry, frugality, or chastity, are always amiable; but
inasmuch as their exercise requires a gentler though steadier exertion than is necessary for the restraint of anger or fear, the
beauty and grace which belong to them are less dazzling, though none the less pleasing, than the qualities which attend the
It has already been observed that the point of propriety, or degree of any passion with which an impartial spectator can
approve, is differently situated in different passions, in some cases lying nearer to the excess, and in others nearer to the
defect. But it remains to be noticed, "that the passions which the spectator is most disposed to sympathize with, and in
which, upon that account, the point of propriety may be said to stand high, are those of which the immediate feeling or
sensation is more or less agreeable to the person principally concerned; and that, on the contrary, the passions which the
spectator is `least disposed to sympathize with, and in which, upon that account, the point of propriety may be said to stand
low, are those of which the immediate feeling or sensation is more or less disagreeable or even painful to the person
For instance, the disposition to the social affections, to humanity, kindness, natural affection, or friendship, being always
agreeable to the person who feels them, meets with more sympathy in its excess than in its defect. Though we blame a
disposition, that is too ready and indiscriminate in its kindness, we regard it with pity rather than with the dislike which we
feel towards a person who is defective in kindness, or characterized by what is called hardness of heart. On the other hand,
the disposition to the unsocial affectionsto anger, hatred, envy, or maliceas it is more agreeable to the person principally
concerned in defect than in excess, so any defect of those passions approaches nearer to the point of propriety approved of
by the spectator than any excess in their manifestation. Their excess renders a man wretched and miserable in his own mind,
and hence their defect is more pleasing to others. Nevertheless even the defect may be excessive. The want of proper
indignation is a most essential defect in any character, if it prevents a man from protecting either himself or his friends from
insult or injustice. Or again, that defect of or freedom from envy, which, founded on indolence or good nature, or on an
aversion to trouble or op position, suffers others readily to rise far above us, as it generally leads to much regret and
repentance afterwards, so it often gives place "to a most malignant envy in the end, and to a hatred of that superiority which
those who have once attained it may often become really entitled to, by the very circumstance of having attained it. In order
to live comfortably in the world, it is upon all occasions as necessary to defend our dignity and rank as it is to defend our
Sensibility to our own personal dangers, injuries, or fortunes, is more apt to offend by its excess than by its defect, and here
again the same rule prevails, for a fretful or timid disposition renders a man miserable to himself as well as offensive. to
others. A calm temper, which contentedly lays its account to suffer somewhat from both the natural and moral evils infesting
the world, is a blessing to the man himself, and gives ease and security to all his fellows. But such defect of sensibility may
also be excessive, for the man who feels little for his own misfortunes or injuries will always feel less for those of other
A defect of sensibility to the pleasures and amusements of life is more offensive than the excess, for both to the person
primarily affected and to the spectator a strong propensity to joy is more pleasing than the contrary. This propensity is only
blamed when its indulgence is unsuited to time or place, to the age or the situation of a person, and when it leads to the
neglect of his interest or duty. But it is rather in such cases the weakness of the sense of propriety and duty that is blamed
Self-esteem also is more agreeable in excess than in defect, for it is so much more pleasant to think highly than it is to think
meanly of ourselves. And just as we apply two different standards to our judgment about others, so in self-estimation we
apply to ourselves both the standard of absolute perfection and that of the ordinary approximation thereto. To these two
standards the same man often bestows a different degree of attention at different times. In every man there exists an idea of
exact propriety and perfection; an idea gradually formed from observations of himself and others, "the slow, gradual, and
progressive work of the great demigod within the breast, the great judge and arbiter of conduct." It is an idea which, in
every man, is more or less accurately drawn, more or less justly coloured and designed, according to the delicacy and care
But it is the wise and virtuous man who, having made these observations with the utmost care, directs his conduct chiefly by
this ideal standard, and esteems himself rightly in consequence. He feels the imperfect success of all his best endeavours to
assimilate his conduct to that archetype of perfection, and remembers with humiliation the frequency of his aberration from
the exact rules of perfect propriety. And so conscious is he of his imperfection that, even when he judges himself by the
second standard of ordinary rectitude, he is unable to regard with contempt the still greater imperfection of other people.
Thus his character is one of real modesty, for he combines, with a very moderate estimate of his own merit, a full sense of
The difference indeed between such a man and the ordinary man is the difference between the great artist who judges of his
own works by his conception of ideal perfection and the lesser artist who judges of his work merely by comparison with the
work of other artists. The poet Boileau, who used to say that no great man was ever completely satisfied with his own work,
being once assured by Santeuil, a writer of Latin verses, that he, for his own part, was completely satisfied with his own,
replied that he was certainly the only great man who ever was so. Yet how much harder of attainment is the ideal perfection
in conduct than it is in art! For the artist may work undisturbed, and in full possession of all his skill and experience. But "the
wise man must support the propriety of his own conduct in health and in sickness, in success and in disappointment, in the
hour of fatigue and drowsy indolence, as well as in that of the most wakened attention. The most sudden and unexpected
assaults of difficulty and distress must never surprise him. The injustice of other people must never provoke him to injustice.
The violence of faction must never confound him. All the hardships and hazards of war must never either dishearten or appal
Pride and vanity are two distinct kinds of that excessive self-estimation which we blame in persons who enjoy no
distinguished superiority over the common level of mankind; and though the proud man is often vain, and the vain man
The proud man is sincere, and in the bottom of his heart convinced of his own superiority. He wishes you to view him in no
other light than that in which, when he places him- self in your situation, lie really views himself. He only demands justice.
He deigns not to explain the grounds of his pretensions; he disdains to court esteem, and even affects to despise it. He is too
well contented with himself to think that his character requires any amendment. He does not always feel at ease in the
company of his equals, and still less in that of his superiors. Unable as he is to lay down his lofty pretensions, and overawed
by such superiority, he has recourse to humbler company, for which he has little respect, and in which he finds little
pleasurethat of his inferiors or dependants. If he visits his superiors, it is to show that he is entitled to live with them more
than from any real satisfaction he derives from them. He never flatters, and is often scarcely civil to anybody. He seldom
stoops to falsehood; but if he does, it is to lower other people, and to detract from that superiority which he thinks unjustly
The Vain man is different in nearly all these points. He is not sincerely convinced of the superiority he claims. Seeing the
respect which is paid to rank and fortune, talents or virtues, lie seeks to usurp such respect; and by his dress and mode of
living proclaims a higher rank and fortune than really belong to him. He is delighted with viewing himself, not in the light in
which we should view him if we knew all that he knows, but in that in which lie imagines that he has induced us to view him.
Unlike the proud man, he courts the company of his superiors, enjoying the reflected splendour of associating with them. "
He haunts the courts of kings and the levees of ministers,..... he is fond of being admitted to the tables of the great, and still
more fond of magnifying to other people the familiarity with which he is honoured there; he associates himself as much as he
can with fashionable people, with those who are supposed to direct the public opinion with the witty, with the learned, with
the popular; and he shuns the company of his best friends, whenever the very uncertain current of public favour happens to
run in any respect against them." Nevertheless, "vanity is almost always a sprightly and gay, and very often a good-natured
passion." Even the falsehoods of the vain man are all innocent falsehoods, meant to raise himself, not to lower other people.
He does not, like the proud man, think his character above improvement; but, in his desire of the esteem and admiration of
others, is actuated by a real motive to noble exertion. Vanity is frequently only a premature attempt to usurp glory before it
is due; and so "the great secret of education is to direct vanity to proper objects," by discouraging pretensions to trivial
Both the proud and the vain man are constantly dissatisfied; the one being tormented by what he considers the unjust
superiority of other people, and the other dreading the shame of the detection of his groundless pretensions. So that here
again the rule holds good; and that degree of self-estimation which contributes most to the happiness and contentment of the
person himself, is likewise that which most commends itself to the approbation of the impartial spectator. 
It remains, then, to draw some concluding comparisons between the virtues of Self-command and the three primary
The virtues of self-command are almost entirely recommended to us by the sense of propriety, by regard to the sentiments of
the supposed impartial spectator; whilst the virtues of prudence, justice and benevolence, are chiefly recommended to us by
concern for our own happiness or the happiness of other people. They are recommended to us primarily by our selfish or
benevolent affections, independently of any regard as to what are or ought to be the sentiments of other people. Such regard
indeed comes later to enforce their practice; and no man ever trod steadily in their paths whose conduct was not principally
directed by a regard to the sentiments of the sup- posed impartial spectator, the great inmate of the breast and arbiter of our
conduct. But regard for the sentiments of other people constitutes the very foundation of the virtues of self-restraint, and is
the sole principle that can moderate our passions to that degree where the spectator will give his approval. 
Another difference is, that while regard to the beneficial effects of prudence, justice, and benevolence recommend them
originally to the agent and afterwards to the spectator, no such sense of their utility adds itself to our sense of the propriety
of the virtues of self-command. Their effects may be agreeable or the contrary, without affecting the approbation bestowed
on them. Valour displayed in the cause of justice is loved and admired, but in the cause of injustice it is still regarded with
some approbation. In that, as in all the other virtues of self-command, it is the greatness and steadiness of the exertion, and
the strong sense of propriety necessary to maintain that exertion, which is the source of admiration. The effects are often
Although Adam Smith never distinctly faces the problem of the supreme end of life, nor asks himself whether virtue and
morality are merely means to the attainment of happiness, or whether they are ends in themselves irrespective of happiness,
he leaves little doubt that happiness really occupies in his system very much the same place that it does in the systems of
professed utilitarians. But he distinguishes between happiness as the natural result of virtue and happiness as the end or
purpose of virtue; and, by satisfying himself that it is the natural result, he saves himself from considering whether, if' it were
"The happiness of mankind," he says, "as well as of all other rational creatures, seems to have been the original purpose of
the Author of Nature," no other end appearing to be worthy of His supreme wisdom and beneficence. The fact therefore that
we most effectually promote the happiness of mankind, and so to some extent promote the great plan of Providence by
acting according to the dictates of our moral faculties, is an additional reason, though not the primary one, for our doing so;
and, conversely, the tendency of an opposite course of conduct to obstruct the scheme thus ordained for the happiness of the
world, is an additional reason for abstaining from it. Accordingly, the ultimate sanction of our compliance with the rules for
the promotion of human welfarethe ultimate sanction, that is, of virtuelies in a system of future rewards and punishments,
To this extent, therefore, Adam Smith seems to agree with the utilitarianism of Paley in making the happiness of another
world the ultimate motive for virtuous action in this. But although be thus appeals to religion as enforcing the sense of duty,
he is far from regarding morality as only valuable for that reason. He protests against the theory that "we ought not to be
grateful from gratitude, we ought not to be charitable from humanity, we ought not to be public-spirited from the love of
our country, nor generous and just from the love of mankind, and that our sole motive in performing these duties should be
Hence when he speaks of the perfection and happiness of mankind as "the great end" aimed at by nature, it is clear that he
intends the temporal and general welfare of' the world, and that, though the happiness of another may be a motive to virtue,
it is not so much the end and object of it as happiness in this. It is in this life, also, that virtue and happiness, vice and misery,
are closely associated; and nature may be regarded as having purposely bestowed on every virtue and vice that precise
reward or punishment which is best fitted either to encourage the one or to restrain the other. Thus the reward attached to
industry and prudencenamely, success in every sort of businessis precisely that which is best calculated to encourage those
virtues, just as in the same way and for the same reason there is attached to the practice of truth, justice, and humanity, the
confidence and esteem of those we live with. It requires indeed a very extraordinary concurrence of circumstances to defeat
those natural and temporal rewards or punishments for virtue or vice, which have been fixed in the sentiments and opinions
Adam Smith does not then regard virtue entirely as its own end, irrespective of its recompence in the increase of our
happiness. Still less, however, does he acknowledge the cardinal doctrine of the utilitarian school, that virtue derives its
whole and sole merit from its conduciveness to the general welfare of humanity. He takes up a sort of middle ground
between the Epicurean theory, that virtue is good as a means to happiness as the end, and the theory of the Stoics, that
virtue is an end in itself independently of happiness. The practice of virtue, he would have said, is a means to happiness, and
has been so related to it by nature; but it has, nevertheless,  prior claims of its own, quite apart from all reference to its effect
There is little attempt on the part of our author at any scientific analysis of human happiness like that attempted by Aristotle,
and in modern times by Hutcheson or Bentham. But if we take Aristotle's classification of the three principal classes of lives
as indicative of the three main ideas of human happiness current in the world, namely, the life of pleasure, the life of
ambition, and the life of contemplation and know- ledge, there is no doubt under which of these three types Adam Smith
The life of pleasure, or that ideal of life which seeks happiness in the gratification of sensual enjoyment, he rejects rather by
im- plication than otherwise, by not treating it as worthy of discussion at all. But his rejection of the life of ambition is of
more interest, both because he constantly recurs to it, and because it seems to express his own general philosophy of life and
Happiness, he says, consists in tranquillity and enjoyment. Without tranquillity there can no be enjoyment, and with
tranquillity there is scarcely anything but may prove a source of pleasure. Hence the Stoics were so far right, in that they
maintained that as between one permanent situation and another there was but little difference with regard to real happiness;
and the great source of all human misery is our constant tendency to overrate the difference between such situations. Thus
avarice overrates the difference between poverty and wealth, ambition that between public and private life, vain-glory that
between obscurity and renown. "In ease of body and peace of mind all the different ranks of life are nearly on a level, and the
beggar who suns himself by the side of the highway possesses that security which kings are fighting for." 
The story, therefore, of what the favourite of the king of Epirus said to his master admits of general application to men in nil
the situations of human life. When Pyrrhus had recounted all his intended conquests, Cincas asked him, "What does your
majesty propose to do then?" "I propose," said the king, "to enjoy myself with my friends, and endeavour to be good
In the highest situation we can fancy, the pleasures from which we propose to derive our real happiness are generally the
same as those which, in a humbler station, we have at all times at hand and in our power. The poor man's son, "whom
heaven in its anger has visited with ambition," will go through, in the first month of his pursuit of the pleasures of wealth,
more fatigue of body and uneasiness of mind than he could have suffered through the whole of his life for the want of them.
"Examine the records of history, recollect what has happened in the circle of your own experience, consider with attention
what has been the conduct of almost all the greatly unfortunate, either in private or public life, whom you have either read of
or heard of or remember, and you will find that the misfortunes of by far the greater part of them have arisen from their not
"What can be added," asks Adam Smith, "to the happiness of the man who is in health, who is out of debt, and has a clear
conscience?" And this condition, he maintains, is the ordinary condition of the greater part of mankind. Would you live
freely, fearlessly, and independently, there is one sure way: "Never enter the place from whence so few have been able to
return, never come within the circle of ambition." The love of public admiration admits of no rival nor successor in the
breast, and all other pleasures sicken by comparison with it. It is very true, as was said by Rochefoucault, "Love is
The following passage is perhaps the best illustration of our philosopher's view of the objects of ambition. "Power and
riches," he says, "are enormous and operose machines contrived to produce a few trifling conveniences to the body,
consisting of springs the most nice and delicate, which must be kept in order with the most anxious attention, and which, in
spite of all our care, are ready every moment to burst into pieces, and to crush in their ruins their unfortunate possessor.
`They are immense fabrics which it requires the labour of a life to raise, which threaten every moment to overwhelm the
person that dwells in them, and which, while they stand, though they may save him from some smaller inconveniencies, can
protect him from none of the severer inclemencies of the season. They keep off the summer shower but not the winter
storm, but leave him as much, and sometimes more, exposed than before to anxiety, to fear, and to sorrow; to diseases, to
The question then arises, Why do we all so generally flee from poverty and pursue riches? The answer is (and it is one of the
happiest applications of the author's favourite theory, though it equally solves the problem of the great absence of
contentment), from regard to the common sentiments of mankind; from the greater sympathy or admiration naturally felt for
the rich than for the poor. For being as we are more disposed to sympathize with joy than with sorrow, we more naturally
enter into the agreeable emotions which accompany the possessor of riches, whilst we fail of much real fellow-feeling for the
distress and misery of poverty. Sympathy with poverty is a sympathy of pity; sympathy with wealth a sympathy of
admiration, a sympathy altogether more pleasurable than the other. The situation of wealth most sets a man in the view of
general sympathy and attention; and it is the consciousness of this sympathetic admiration which riches bring with them, not
the ease or pleasure they afford, that makes their possession so ardently desired. It is the opposite consciousness which
makes all the misery of poverty; the feeling of being placed away from the sight or notice of mankind, the feeling that a
man's misery is also disagreeable to others. Hence it is that for every calamity or injury which affects the rich, the spectator
feels ten times more compassion than when the same things happen to other people; thus all the innocent blood that was
shed in the civil wars provoked less indignation than the death of Charles I.; and hence the misfortunes of kings, like those of
lovers, are the only real proper subjects of tragedy, for in spite of reason and experience our imagination attaches to these
But this disposition of mankind to sympathize with all the passions of the rich and powerful has also its utility as the source
of the distinction of ranks and of the peace and order of society. It is not the case, as was taught by Epicurus, that the
tendency of riches and power to procure pleasure makes them desirable, and that the tendency to produce pain is the great
evil of poverty. Riches are desirable for the general sympathy which goes along with them, and the absence of such
sympathy is the evil of their want. Still less is the reverence of men for their superiors founded on any selfish expectations of
benefit from their good-will. It arises rather from a simple admiration of the advantages of their position, and is primarily a
disinterested sentiment. From a natural sympathetic admiration of their happiness, we desire to serve them for their own
It would equally be a mistake to suppose that the common deference paid to the rich is founded on any regard for the
general utility of such submission, or for the support it gives to the maintenance of social order, for even when it may be
most beneficial to oppose them, such opposition is most reluctantly made. The tendency to reverence them is so natural, that
even when a people are brought to desire the punishment of their kings, the sorrow felt for the mortification of a monarch is
ever ready to revive former sentiments, of loyalty. The death of Charles I. brought about the Restoration, and sympathy for
James II when he was caught by the populace making his escape on board ship, went very nigh to preventing the
But although this disposition to sympathize with the rich is conducive to the good order of society, Adam Smith admits that
it to a certain extent tends to corrupt moral sentiments. For in equal degrees of merit, the rich and great receive more honour
than the poor and humble; and if it be "scarce agreeable to good morals or even to good language, to say that mere wealth
and greatness, abstracted from merit and virtue, deserve our respect," it is certain that they almost always obtain it, and that
Hence it comes about, that "the external graces, the frivolous accomplishments, of that impertinent and foolish thing, called
a man of fashion, are commonly more admired than the solid and masculine virtues of a warrior, a statesman, a philosopher
or a legislator." Not only the dress, and language, and behaviour of the rich and great become favourable, but their vices and
follies too, vain men giving themselves airs of a fashionable profligacy of which in their hearts they do not approve and of
which perhaps they are not guilty. For "there are hypocrites of wealth and greatness as well as of religion and virtue; and a
In our sympathy for rank and wealth, as explained in the last chapter, Adam Smith sees plainly the "benevolent wisdom of
nature." "Nature," he says, "has wisely judged that the distinction of ranks, the peace and order of society, would rest more
securely upon the plain and palpable difference of birth and fortune than upon the invisible and often uncertain difference of
wisdom and virtue." And in discussing the perverting influence of chance upon our moral sentiments, he finds the same
justification for our admiration of Success. For equally with our admiration for mere wealth it is necessary for the stability of
society. We are thereby taught to submit more easily to our superiors, and to regard with reverence, or a kind of respectful
affection, that fortunate violence we can no longer resist. By this admiration for success, we acquiesce with less reluctance
in the government which an irresistible force often imposes on us, and submit no less easily to an Attila or a Tamerlane than
To a certain extent this conception of Nature, and recognition of design, entered into the general thought of the time. Even
Hume said, "It is wisely ordained by nature that private connexions should commonly prevail over universal views and
considerations; otherwise our affections and actions would be dissipated and lost for want of a proper limited object." But
Adam Smith more particularly adopted this view of things, and the assumption of Final Causes as explanatory of moral
phenomena is one of the most striking features in his philosophy; nor does he ever weary of identifying the actual facts or
results of morality with the actual intention of nature. It seems as if the shadow of Mandeville had rested over his pen, and
that he often wrote rather as the advocate of a system of nature which he believed to have been falsely impugned than as
merely the analyst of our moral sentiments. Writing too as he describes himself to have done, with an immense landscape of
lawns and woods and mountains before his window, it is perhaps not surprising, that his observation of the physical world
should have pleasantly affected his contemplation of the moral one, and blessed him with that optimistic and genial view of
The extent to which Adam Smith applies his doctrine of final causes in ethics is so remarkable, that it is worth while to
Our propensity to sympathize with joy being, as has been said, much stronger than our propensity to sympathize with
sorrow, we more fully sympathize with our friends in their joys than in their sorrows. It is a fact, that however conscious we
may be of the justice of another's lamentation, and however much we may reproach ourselves for our want of sensibility, our
sympathy with the afflictions of our friends generally vanishes when we leave their presence. Such is the fact, the final cause
of which is thus stated: "Nature, it seems, when she loaded us with our own sorrows, thought that they were enough, and
therefore did not command us to take any further share in those of others than was necessary to prompt us to relieve them." 
Another purpose of nature may be traced in the fact, that as expressions of kindness and gratitude attract our sympathy,
those of hatred and resentment repel it. The hoarse discord- ant voice of anger inspires us naturally with fear and aversion,
and the symptoms of the disagreeable affections never excite, but often disturb, our sympathy. For, man having been formed
for society, "it was, it seems, the intention of nature that those rougher and more unamiable emotions which drive men from
Our natural tendency to sympathize with the resentment of another has also its purpose. For instance, in the case of a
murder, we feel for the murdered man the same resentment which he would feel, were he conscious himself, and into which
we so far enter as to carry it out as his avengers; and thus, with regard to the most dreadful of all crimes, has nature,
antecedent to all reflections on the utility of punishment, stamped indelibly on the human heart an immediate and instinctive
Resentment within moderation is defensible as one of the original passions of our nature, and is the counterpart of gratitude.
Nature "does not seem to have dealt so unkindly with us as to have endowed us with any principle which is wholly and in
every respect evil." The very existence of society depending as it does on the punishment of unprovoked malice, man has not
been left to his own reason, to discover that the punishment of bad actions is the proper means to pre- serve society, but he
has been endowed with an immediate and instinctive approbation of that very application of punishment which is so
necessary. In this case, as in so many others, the economy of nature is the same, in endowing mankind with an instinctive
desire for the means necessary for the attainment of one of her favourite ends. As the self-preservation of the individual is an
end, for which man has not been left to the exercise of his own reason to find out the means, but has been impelled to the
means themselves, namely, food and drink, by the immediate instincts of hunger and thirst, so the preservation of society is
an end, to the means to which man is directly impelled by an instinctive desire for the punishment of bad actions. 
The same explanation is then applied to the fact, that beneficence, or the doing good to others, as less necessary to society
than justice, or the not doing evil to others, is not enforced by equally strong natural sanctions. Society is conceivable
without the practice of beneficence, but not without that of justice. without justice, society, "the peculiar and darling care of
nature," must in a moment crumble to atoms. It is the main pillar which upholds the whole edifice, whilst beneficence is only
the ornament which embellishes it. For this reason stronger motives were necessary to enforce justice than to enforce
beneficence. Therefore nature "implanted in the human breast that consciousness of ill-desert, those terrors of merited
punishment which attend its violation, as the great safeguard of the association of mankind, to protect the weak, to curb the
In the influence of fortune over our moral sentiments, in our disposition to attach less praise where by accident a good
intention has stopped short of real action, to feel less resent- ment where a criminal design has stopped short of fulfilment,
and to feel a stronger sense of the merit or demerit of actions when they chance to occasion extraordinary but unintended
pleasure or pain, Adam Smith again traces the working of a final cause, and sees in this irregularity of our sentiments an
intention on the part of Nature to promote the happiness of our species. For were resentment as vividly kindled by a mere
design to injure as by an actual injury, were bad wishes held equivalent to bad conduct, mere thoughts and feelings would
become the objects of punishment, and a state of universal suspicion would allow of no security even for the most innocent.
If, on the other hand, the mere wish to serve another were regarded as equivalent to the actual service, an indolent
benevolence might take the place of active well-doing, to the detriment of those ends which are the purpose of man's
existence. In the same way, man is taught, by that mere animal resentment which arises naturally against every injury,
howsoever accidental, to respect the well-being of his fellows, and, by a fallacious sense of guilt, to dread injuring them by
Let us take next the manifestation of fortitude under misfortune. A man's self-approbation under such circumstances is
exactly proportioned to the degree of self-command necessary to obtain it; or, in other words, to the degree in which he can
assume with regard to himself the feelings of the impartial and indifferent spectator. Thus a man who speaks and acts the
moment after his leg has been shot off by a cannon-ball with his usual coolness, feels, as a reflex of the applause of the
indifferent spectator, an amount of self-approbation exactly proportioned to the self-command he exhibits. And thus Nature
exactly apportions her reward to the virtue of a man's behaviour. But it is nevertheless not fitting that the reward which
Nature thus bestows on firmness of conduct should entirely compensate him for the sufferings which her laws inflict on him.
For, if it did so, a man could have no motive from self-interest for avoiding accidents which cannot but diminish his utility
both to himself and society. Nature therefore, "from her parental care of both, meant that he should anxiously avoid all such
This is a good illustration of the difficulties of this kind of reasoning in general. It will be easily seen that it raises more
doubts than it solves. If there really is this parental care on the part of Nature for mankind, why are her measures
incomplete? If the reward she bestows on fortitude did entirely compensate for the misfortunes it contends with, would not
all the evil of them be destroyed? And might not Nature, with her parental care, have made laws which could not be
violated, rather than make laws whose observance needs the protection of misfortune? It does not solve the problem of
moral evil, to show here and there beneficial results; it only makes the difficulty the greater. Where there is so much good,
To this question Adam Smith attempts no answer, or thinks the problem solved by the discovery of some good side to
everything evil. His whole system is based on the theory that the works of Nature "seem all intended to promote happiness
and guard against misery." Against those "whining and melancholy Moralists," who reproach us for being happy in the midst
of all the misery of the world, he replies, not only that if we take the whole world on an average, there will be for every man
in pain or misery twenty in prosperity and joy, and that we have no more reason to weep with the one than to rejoice with
the twenty, but also that, if we were so constituted as to feel distress for the evil we do not see, it could serve no other
purpose than to increase misery twofold. This is true enough; but it is another thing to argue from the fact to the purpose,
and to say that it has been wisely ordained by Nature that we should not feel interested in the fortune of those whom we can
neither serve nor hurt. For it is to men whose sympathies have been wider than the average that all the diminution of the
world's misery has been due; and it is fair, if we must argue about Nature at all, to say that had she endowed men generally
with wider sympathies than she has done, the misery in the world might have been still more reduced than it has been, and
Similar thoughts arise with respect to the following passage, wherein Adam Smith contends, in words that seem a foretaste
of the Wealth of Nations, that Nature leads us intentionally, by an illusion of the imagination, to the pursuit of riches. "It is
well that Nature imposes upon us in this manner. It is this deception which rouses and keeps in continual motion the industry
of mankind. It is this which first prompted them to cultivate the ground, to build houses, to found cities and
commonwealths, and to invent and improve all the sciences and arts, which ennoble and embellish human life; which have
entirely changed the whole face of the globe, have turned the rude forests of nature into agreeable and fertile plains, and
made the trackless and barren ocean a new fund of subsistence, and the great high road of communication to the different
nations of the earth .... It is to no purpose that the proud and unfeeling landlord views his extensive fields, and, without a
thought for the wants of his brethren, in imagination consumes himself the whole harvest that grows upon them.... The
capacity of his stomach bears no proportion to the immensity of his desires, and will receive no more than that of the
meanest peasant.(7) The rest he is obliged to distribute among those who prepare, in the nicest manner, that little which he
himself makes use of, among those who fit up the palace in which this little is to be consumed, among those who provide
and keep in order all the different baubles and trinkets which are employed in the economy of greatness; all of whom thus
derive from his luxury and caprice that share of the necessaries of life which they would in vain have expected from his
humanity or his justice. The produce of the soil maintains at all times nearly that number of inhabitants which it is capable of
maintaining. The rich only select from the heap what is most precious and agreeable. They consume little more than the
poor; and in spite of their natural selfishness and rapacity, though they mean only their own conveniency, though the sole
end which they propose from the labours of all the thousands whom they employ be the gratification of their own vain and
insatiable desires, they divide with the poor the produce of all their improvements. They are led by an invisible hand to make
nearly the same distribution of the necessaries of life which would have been made had the earth been divided into equal
portions among all its inhabitants....  When Providence divided the earth among a few lordly masters, it neither forgot nor
abandoned those who seemed to have been left out in the partition. These last, too, enjoy their share of all that it produces.
In what constitutes the real happiness of human life, they are in no respect inferior to those who would seem so much above
Adam Smith applies the same argument to the condition of children. Nature, he maintains, has for the wisest purposes
rendered parental tenderness in all or most men much stronger than filial affection. For the continuance of the species
depends upon the former, not upon the latter; and whilst the existence and preservation of a child depends altogether on the
care of its parents, the existence of the parents is quite independent of the child. In the Decalogue, though we are
commanded to honour our fathers and mothers, there is no mention of love for our children, Nature having sufficiently
provided for that. "In the eye of Nature, it would seem, a child is a more important object than an old man, and excites a
much more lively as well as a more universal sympathy." Thus, again, with regard to the excessive credulity of children, and
their disposition to believe whatever they are told, "nature seems to have judged it necessary for their preservation that they
should, for some time at least, put implicit confidence in those to whom the care of their childhood, and of the earliest and
The love of our country, again, is by nature endeared to us, not only by all our selfish, but by all our private benevolent
affections; for in its welfare is comprehended our own, and that of all our friends and relations. We do not therefore love our
country merely as a part of the great society of mankind, but for its own sake, and independently of other considerations.
"That wisdom which contrived the system of human affections, as well as that of every other part of nature, seems to have
judged that the interest of the great society of mankind would be best promoted by directing the principal attention of each
individual to that particular portion of it which was most within the sphere both of his abilities and of his understanding." 
To sum up our author's application of his theory to his general scheme of ethics. Man, having been intended by nature for
society, was fitted by her for that situation. Hence she endowed him with an original desire to please, and an original
aversion to offend, his brethren. By teaching him to feel pleasure in their favourable, and pain in their unfavourable regards,
she laid, in the reward of their approbation, or the punishment of their disapproval, the foundation of human ethics. In the
respect which she has taught him to feel for their judgment and sentiments, she has raised in his mind a sense of Duty, and
girt her laws for his conduct with the sanction of obligatory morality. And so happily has she adjusted the sentiments of
approbation and disapprobation to the advantage both of the individual and of society, that it is precisely those qualities
which are useful or advantageous to the individual himself, or to others, which are always accounted virtuous or the
The influence which Hume's philosophy exercised over that of Adam Smith has already been noticed with respect to the
fundamental facts of sympathy, and the part played by them in the formation of our moral sentiments. But it is chiefly with
respect to the position of Utility in moral philosophy that Adam Smith's theory is affected by Hume's celebrated Inquiry
concerning, the Principles of Morals. Not only are all his speculations coloured by considerations of utility, but be devotes a
In Adam Smith's theory, the tendency of any affection to produce beneficial or hurtful results is only one part of the
phenomenon of moral approbation, constituting our sense of merit or demerit, while the other part consists in our perception
of the propriety or impropriety of the affection to the object which excites it. And as the sense of the merit or demerit of any
action or conduct is much stronger than our sense of the propriety or impropriety of affections; stimulating us, not merely to
a passive feeling of approbation or the contrary, but to a desire to confer actual reward or punishment on the agent, it is
evident that the greater part of moral approbation consists in the perception of utility of tendency. 
So far, Adam Smith agrees with the utilitarian theory but he refuses altogether to assent to the doctrine, that the perception
of the utility of virtue is its primary recommendation, or that a sense of the evil results of vice is the origin of our hatred
against it. It is true that the tendency of virtue to promote, and of vice to disturb the order of society, is to reflect a very
great beauty on the one, and a very great deformity on the other. But both the beauty and the deformity are additional to an
already existent beauty and deformity, and a beauty and deformity inherent in the objects themselves. Human society may be
compared to "an immense machine, whose regular and harmonious movements produce a thousand agreeable effects. As in
any other beautiful and noble machine that was the production of human art, whatever tended to render its movements more
smooth and easy, would derive a beauty from this effect; and on the contrary, whatever tended to obstruct them, would
displease upon that account; so virtue, which is, as it were, the fine polish to the wheels of society, necessarily pleases; while
vice, like the vile rust, which makes them jar and grate upon one another, is as necessarily offensive." 
According to Hume, the whole approbation of virtue may be resolved into the perception of beauty which results from the
appearance of its utility, no qualities of the mind being ever approved of as virtuous, or disapproved of as vicious, but such
as are either useful or agreeable to the person himself, or to others, or else have a contrary tendency. Adam Smith fully
admits the fact, that the characters of men may be fitted either to promote or to disturb the happiness both of the individual
himself and of the society to which he belongs, and that there is a certain analogy between our approbation of a useful
machine and a useful course of conduct. The character of prudence, equity, activity, and resolution, holds out the prospect
of prosperity and satisfaction both to the person himself and to every one connected with him; whilst the rash, insolent,
slothful, or effeminate character, portends ruin to the individual, and misfortune to all who have anything to do with him. In
the former character there is all the beauty which can belong to the most perfect machine ever invented for promoting the
most agreeable purpose; in the other there is all the deformity of an awkward and clumsy contrivance. 
But this perception of beauty in virtue, or of deformity in vice, though it enhances and enlivens our feelings with regard to
both, is not the first or principal source of our approbation of the one, or of our dislike for the other. 
"For, in the first place, it seems impossible that the approbation of virtue should be a sentiment of the same kind with that by
which we approve of a convenient and well-contrived building; or, that we should have no other reason for praising a man
"And, secondly, it will be found, upon examination, that the usefulness of any disposition of mind is seldom the first ground
of our approbation; and that the sentiment of approbation always involves in it a sense of propriety quite distinct from the
For instance, superior reason and understanding is a quality most useful to ourselves, as enabling us to discern the remote
consequences of our actions, and to foresee the advantage or disadvantage likely to result from them; but it is a quality
originally approved of as just and right, and accurate, and not merely as useful or advantageous. Self-command, also, is a
virtue we quite as much approve of under the aspect of propriety, as under that of utility. It is the correspondence of the
agent's sentiments with our own, that is the source of our approbation of them; and it is only because his pleasure a week or
a year hence is just as interesting or indifferent to us, as spectators, as the pleasure that tempts him at this moment, that we
approve of his sacrifice of present to future enjoyment. We approve of his acting as if the remote object interested him as
much as the future one, because then his affections correspond exactly with our own, and we recognize the perfect propriety
With respect again to such qualities which are most useful to othersas humanity, justice, generosity, and public spiritthe
esteem and approbation paid to them depends in the, same way on the concord between the affections of the agent and those
of the spectator. The propriety of an act of generosity, as when a man sacrifices some great interest of his own to that of a
friend or a superior, or prefers some other person to himself, lies not in the consideration of the good effect of such an
action on society at large, but in the agreement of the individual's point of view with that of the impartial spectator. Thus, if
a man gives up his own claims to an office which had been a great object of his ambition, because he imagines that another
man's services are better entitled to it, or if he exposes his life to defend that of a friend which he considers of more
importance, it is because he considers the point of view of disinterested persons, who would prefer that other man or friend
to himself, that his conduct seems clothed with that appearance of propriety which constitutes the approbation bestowed on
it. It is the accommodation of the feelings of the individual to those of the impartial bystander, which is the source of the
admiration bestowed on a soldier, who throws away his life to defend that of his officer, and who deserves and wins
applause, not from any feeling of concern for his officer, but from the adjustment of his own feelings to those of every one
So with regard to public spirit, the first source of our admiration of it is not founded so much on a sense of its utility as upon
the great and exalted propriety of the actions to which it prompts. Take, for instance, the case of Brutus, leading his own
sons to capital punishment for their con- spiracy against the rising liberty of Rome. Naturally he ought to have felt much
more for the death of his own sons than for all that Rome could have suffered from the want of the example. But he viewed
them, not as a father, but as a Roman citizen; that is to say, he entered so thoroughly into the sentiments of the impartial
spectator, or of the ordinary Roman citizen, that even his own sons weighed as nothing in the balance with the smallest
interest of Rome. The propriety of the action, or the perfect sympathy of feeling between the agent and the spectator, is the
cause of our admiration of it. Its utility certainly bestows upon it a new beauty, and so still further recommends it to our
approbation. But such beauty "is chiefly perceived by men of reflection and speculation, and is by no means the quality
Adam Smith also differs from Hume no less in his theory of the cause of the beauty which results from a perception of utility
than in his theory of the place assignable to utility in the principle of moral approbation. According to Hume, the utility of
any object is a source of pleasure from its suggestion of the conveniency it is intended to promote, from its fitness to
produce the end intended by it. Adam Smith maintains, rather by way of supplement than of contradiction, that the fitness of
a thing to produce its end, or the happy adjustment of means to the attainment of any convenience or pleasure is often more
regarded than the end or convenience itself, and he gives several instances to illustrate the operation of this principle. 
For instance, a man coming into his room and finding all the chairs in the middle, will perhaps be angry with his servant and
take the trouble to place them all with their backs to the wall, for the sake of the greater convenience of having the floor free
and disengaged. But it is more the arrangement than the convenience which he really cares for, since to attain the
convenience he puts himself to more trouble than he could have suffered from the want of it, seeing that nothing was easier
for him than to have sat down at once on one of the chairs, which is probably all he does when his labour is over. 
The same principle applies to the pursuit of riches, under circumstances which imply much more trouble and vexation than
the possession of them can ever obviate. The poor man's son, cursed with ambition, who admires the convenience of a
palace to live in, of horses to carry him, and of servants to wait on him, sacrifices a real tranquillity for a certain artificial and
elegant repose he may never reach, to find at last that "wealth and greatness are mere trinkets of frivolous utility, no more
adapted for procuring ease of body or tranquillity of mind, than the tweezer-cases of the lover of toys." Indeed, there is no
other real difference between them than that the conveniences of .the one are somewhat more observable than those of the
other. The palaces, gardens, or equipage of the great are objects of which the conveniency strikes every one; their utility is
obvious; and we readily enjoy by sympathy the satisfaction they are fitted to afford. But the conveniency of a toothpick or of
a nail-cutter, being less obvious, it is less easy to enter into the satisfaction of their possessor. They are less reasonable
objects of vanity than wealth and great- ness, and less effectually gratify man's love of distinction. To a man who had to live
alone on a desolate island, it might be a matter of doubt, "whether a palace, or a collection of such small conveniences as are
The fact that the rich and the great are so much the object of admiration is due not so much to any superior ease or pleasure
they are supposed to enjoy, as to the numberless artificial and elegant contrivances they possess for promoting such ease and
pleasure. The spectator does not imagine "that they are really happier than other people, but he imagines that they possess

Again, the sole use and end of all constitutions of government is to promote the happiness of those who live under them.
But from this love of art and contrivance, we often come to value the means more than the end, and to be eager to promote
the happiness of our fellows, less from any sympathy with their sufferings or enjoyment than from a wish to perfect and
improve a beautiful system. Men of the greatest public spirit have often been men of the smallest humanity, like Peter the
Great; and if a public-spirited man encourages the mending of roads, it is not commonly from a fellow-feeling with carriers
This admits however of a practical application, for if you wish to implant public virtue in a man devoid of it, you will tell him
in vain of the superior advantages of a well-governed state, of the better homes, the better clothing, or the better food. But if
you describe the great system of government which procures these advantages, explaining the connexions and
subordinations of their several parts, and their general subserviency to the happiness of their society; if you show the
possibility of introducing such a system into his own country, or of removing the obstructions to it, and setting the wheels of
the machine of government to move with more harmony and smoothness, you will scarce fail to raise in him the desire to
help to remove the obstructions, and to put in motion so beautiful and orderly a machine. It is less the results of a political
The longest and perhaps the most interesting division of Adam Smith's treatise is that in which he reviews the relation of his
own theory to that of other systems of moral philosophy. For like all writers on the same difficult subject, he finds but a very
partial attainment of truth in any system outside his own, and claims for the latter a comprehensive survey of all the
phenomena, which his predecessors had only grasped singly and in detail. Every system of morality, every theory of the
origin of our moral sentiments, has been derived, he thinks, from some one or other of the principles expounded by himself.
And "as they are all of them in this respect founded upon natural principles, they are all of them in some measure in the right.
But as many of them are derived from a partial and imperfect view of nature, there are many of them too in some respects in
I. Thus with regard, first, to the nature of Virtue, all the different theories, whether in ancient or in modern times, may,
Adam Smith thinks, be reduced to three, according as they make it to consist in Propriety, Prudence, or Benevolence: or in
other words, according as they place it in the proper government and direction of all our affections equally, whether selfish
or social; in the judicious pursuit of our own private interest and happiness by the right direction of the selfish affections
alone; or in the disinterested pursuit of the happiness of others under the sole direction of the benevolent affections. 
Adam Smith's own theory differed from all these, in that it took account of all these three different aspects of virtue
together, and gave no exclusive preference to any one of them. With Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics, who made virtue to
consist in propriety of conduct, or in the suitableness of the motive of action to the object which excites it, or with such
modern systems as those of Lord Shaftesbury or Clarke, who defined virtue as maintaining a proper balance of the affections
and passions, or as acting according to the relations or to the truth of things, he so far agreed as to regard such propriety as
constituting one element in our approbation of virtue; but he maintained that this propriety, though an essential ingredient in
every virtuous action, was not always the only one. Propriety commanded approbation, and impropriety disapprobation, but
there were other qualities which commanded a higher degree of esteem or blame, and seemed to call for reward or
punishment respectively. Such were beneficent or vicious actions, in which something was recognized besides mere
propriety or impropriety, and raised feelings stronger than those of mere approval or dislike, and that was their tendency to
produce good or bad results. Moreover, none of the systems which placed virtue in a propriety of affection gave any
measure by which that propriety might be ascer- tained, nor could such a measure be found anywhere but in the sympathetic
Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics, only regarded, in their account of virtue, that part of it which consists in propriety of
conduct. According to Plato, the soul was composed of three different facultiesreason, passion, and appetite; and that
higher form of justice which constitutes perfect virtue was nothing more than that state of mind in which every faculty
confined itself to its proper sphere, without encroaching upon that of any other, and performed its office with precisely that
degree of strength which belonged to it. In other words, this justice, the last and greatest of the cardinal virtues, and that
which comprehended all the others, meant that exact and perfect propriety of conduct, the nature of which has been already
discussed. Nearly the same account of virtue was given by Aristotle, who defined it as the habit of moderation in accordance
with right reason; by which he meant a right affection of mind towards particular objects, as in being neither too much nor
too little affected by objects of fear. And the Stoics so far coincided with Plato and Aristotle as to place perfect virtue, or
rectitude of conduct, in a proper choice or rejection of different objects and circumstances according as they were by nature
rendered more or less the objects of our desire or aversion. In this propriety of the mind towards external things consisted
No less incomplete than systems which placed virtue in propriety alone were those systems which placed it in prudence, or in
a prudential regard for mere personal welfare. Such were the systems of the Cyrenaics and Epicureans in ancient times, and
of writers like Hobbes and Mandeville in modern times. According to Epicurus, the goodness or badness of anything was
ultimately referable to its tendency to produce bodily pleasure or pain. Thus power and riches were desirable as good things,
from their tendency to procure pleasure, whilst the evil of the contrary conditions lay in their close connexion with pain.
Honour and reputation were of value, because the esteem of others was of so much importance to procure us pleasure and
to defend us from pain. And in the same way the several virtues were not desirable simply for themselves, but only by reason
of their intimate connexion with our greatest well-being, ease of body and tranquillity of mind. Thus temperance was nothing
but prudence with regard to pleasure, the sacrifice of a present enjoyment to obtain a greater one or to avoid a greater pain.
Courage was nothing but prudence with regard to danger or labour, not good in itself, but only as repellent of some greater
evil. And justice too was nothing but prudence with regard to our neighbours, a means calculated to procure their esteem,
Adam Smith's first reply to this theory is, that whatever may be the tendency of the several virtues or vices, the sentiments
which they excite in others are the objects of a much more passionate desire or aversion than all their other con- sequences;
that to be-amiable and the proper object of esteem is of more value to us than all the ease and security which love or esteem
can procure us: and that to be odious, or the proper object of contempt, or indignation is more dreadful than all we can
suffer in our body from hatred, contempt, or indignation; and that therefore our desire of the one character and our aversion
to the other cannot arise from regard to the effects which either of them is likely to produce on the body. 
Secondly, there is one aspect of nature from which the Epicurean system derives its plausibility. "By the wise contrivance of
the Author of nature, virtue is upon all ordinary occasions, even with regard to this life, real wisdom, and the surest and
readiest means of obtaining both safety and advantage." The success or failure of our undertakings must very much depend
on the good or bad opinion entertained of us, and on the general disposition of others to assist or oppose us. Hence the
tendency of virtue to promote our interest and of vice to obstruct it, undoubtedly stamps an additional beauty and propriety
upon the one, and a fresh deformity and im propriety upon the other. And thus temperance, magnanimity, justice and
beneficence, come to be approved of, not only under their proper characters, but under the additional character of the most
real prudence and the highest wisdom; whilst the contrary vices come to be disapproved of; not only under their proper
characters, but under the additional character of the most short-sighted folly and weakness. So that the conduciveness of
virtue to happiness is only secondary, and so to speak accidental to its character; it is not its first recommendation to our
But if the theories which resolved virtue into propriety or prudence were thus one-sided, the remaining theorythat best
represented by Hutchesonwas no less so, which made virtue to consist solely in benevolence, or in a disinterested regard to
the good of others or the public generally. So far indeed did Hutcheson carry this theory, that he even rejected as a selfish
motive to virtuous action the pleasure of self-approbation, "the comfortable applause of our own consciences," holding that
it diminished the merit of any benevolent action. The principle of self-love could never be virtuous in any degree, and it was
Several reasons seem, indeed, at first sight, to justify the identification of virtue with benevolence. It is the most agreeable of
all the affections. It is recommended to us by a double sympathy, and we feel it to be the proper object of gratitude and
reward. Even its weakness or its excess is not very disagreeable to us, as is the excess of every other passion. And as it
throws a peculiar charm over every action which proceeds from it, so the want of it adds a peculiar deformity to actions
indicative of disregard to the happiness of others. Our sense too of the merit of any action is just so far increased or
diminished according as we find that benevolence was or was not the motive of the action. If, for instance, an act supposed
to proceed from gratitude is found to proceed from the hope of some fresh favour, all its merit is gone; and so if an action
attributed to a selfish motive is found to have been due to a benevolent one, our sense of its merit is all the more enhanced.
And lastly, in all disputes concerning the rectitude of conduct, the public good, or the tendency of actions to promote the
general welfare, has always been the standard of reference, that being accounted morally good which tends to promote
These reasons led Hutcheson to the conclusion, that an act was meritorious in proportion to the benevolence evidenced by
it; hence that the virtue of an action was proportioned to the extent of happiness it tended to promote, so that the least
virtuous affection was that which aimed no further than at the happiness of an individual, as a son, a brother, or a friend,
whilst the most virtuous was one which embraced as its object the happiness of all intelligent beings. The perfection of virtue
consisted therefore in directing all our actions to promote the greatest possible good, and in subjecting all inferior affections
The first defect which Adam Smith finds in this theory of his former teacher is, that it fails to explain sufficiently our
approbation of the inferior virtues of prudence, temperance, constancy, and firmness. Just as other theories erred in
regarding solely the propriety or impropriety of conduct, and in disregarding its good or bad tendency, so this system erred
by disregarding altogether the suitableness of affections to their exciting cause, and attending only their beneficient or hurtful
In the second place, a selfish motive is not always a bad one. Self-love may often be a virtuous motive to action. Every man
is by nature first and principally recommended to his own care; and because he is fitter to take care of himself than of any
other person, it is right .that he should do so. Regard to our own private happiness and interest may constitute very laudable
motives of action. The habits of economy, industry, discretion, attention, and application of thought, though cultivated from
self-interested motives, are nevertheless praiseworthy qualities, and deserve the esteem and approbation of everybody. On
the other hand, carelessness and want of economy are universally disapproved of, not as proceeding from a want of
And as to the standard of right and wrong being frequently the tendency of conduct to the welfare or disorder of society, it
does not follow that a regard to society should be the sole virtuous motive of action, but only that in any competition it
It was, again, a general defect of each of the three theories which defined virtue as propriety, prudence, or benevolence, that
they tended to give a bias to the mind to some principles of action beyond the proportion that is due to them. Thus the
ancient systems, which placed virtue in propriety, insisted little on the soft and gentle virtues, rather regarding them as
weaknesses to be expunged from the breast, while they laid chief stress on the graver virtues of self-command, fortitude, and
courage. And the benevolent system, while encouraging the milder virtues in the highest degree, went so far as to deny the
name of virtue to the more respectable qualities of the mind, calling them merely "moral abilities," unworthy of the
approbation bestowed on real virtue. Nevertheless the general tendency of each of these systems was to encourage the best
and most laudable habits of the mind, and it were well for society if mankind regulated their conduct by the precepts of any
This general good tendency of these three theories leads our author to classify by itself, and to treat in a distinct chapter, a
system which, he says, destroys altogether the distinction between virtue and vice, and of which the tendency consequently
is wholly pernicious, and that is the system, which he designates as the Licentious System, expounded by Mandeville in the
Adam Smith considers that this system," which once made so much noise in the world could never have imposed upon so
great a number of persons, nor have occasioned so general alarm among those who are the friends of better principles, had it
Mandevilles famous definition of the moral virtues as "the political offspring which flattery begot upon pride," was based on
the assumption that morality was not natural to man, but was the invention of wise men, who, by giving the title of noble to
persons capable of self-denial and of preferring the public interest to their own, won mankind generally, through this subtle
flattery, to what they chose to denominate virtue. Hence whatever men did from a sense of propriety, or from a regard to
what was praiseworthy, they really did from a love of praise, from pride or vanity. This love of praise was one of the
strongest of mans selfish affections, and the foundation of the love of honour. In conduct apparently the most disinterested,
this selfish motive was present. If a man sacrificed his own interest to that of his fellows, he knew that his conduct would be
agreeable to their self-love, and that they would not fail to express their satisfaction by bestowing on himself the most
extravagant praises. The pleasure he would derive from this source counterbalanced the interest he abandoned to procure it.
Hence all public spirit, or preference of public to private interest was a mere cheat and imposition on mankind. 
The fallacy of this system lies, according to Adam Smith, in a sophistical use of the word vanityin its application to a
remote affinity that prevails between two really very different things. To desire praise for qualities which are not praise-
worthy in any degree, or for qualities praiseworthy in themselves but unpossessed by the individual concerned, is vanity
proper; but this frivolous desire for praise at any price is very different from the desire of rendering our- selves the proper
objects of honour and esteem, or of acquiring honour and esteem by really deserving them. The affinity between these very
different desires, of which Mandeville made so much use, lay in the fact that vanity as well as the love of true glory aims at
acquiring esteem and approbation; but the difference consists in this, that the desire of the one is unjust and ridiculous, while
There is also an affinity between the love of virtue and the love of true glory, which gives a certain speciousness to
Mandeville's theory. For there is a close connexion between the desire of becoming what is honourable and estimable, which
is the love of virtue, and the desire of actual honour and esteem, which is the love of true glory. They both have and herein
lies their superficial resemblance to vanitysome reference to the sentiments of others. Even in the love of virtue there is still
some reference, if not to what is, yet to what in reason and propriety ought to be, the opinion of others. The man of the
greatest magnanimity, who desires virtue for its own sake, and is most indifferent about the actual opinions of mankind, is
still delighted with the thoughts of what those opinions ought to be, and with the consciousness that though he may neither
Another feature of Mandeville's system was to deny the existence of any self-denial or disinterestedness in human virtue of
any kind. Thus wherever temperance fell short of the most ascetic abstinence, he treated it as gross luxury; and all our
pretensions to self-denial were based, not on the conquest, but on the concealed indulgence, of our passions. 
Here the fallacy lay in representing every passion as wholly vicious, which is so in any degree and in any direction. There are
some of our passions which have no other names than those which mark the disagreeable and offensive degree, they being
more apt to attract notice in this degree than in any other. It is not therefore to demolish the reality of such a virtue as
temperance, to show that the same indulgence of pleasure which when unrestrained is regarded as blameable, is also present
when the passion is restrained. The virtue in such cases consists, not in an entire insensibility to the objects of passion, but in
The same fallacy underlies the famous paradox that "private vices are public benefits," and that it is not the good, but the evil
qualities of men, which lead to greatness. By using the word luxury, as it was used in the fashionable asceticism of his time,
as in every respect evil, it was easy for Mandeville to show that from this evil all trade and wealth and prosperity flowed, and
that without it no society could flourish. "If;" Adam Smith replies, "the love of magnificence, a taste for the elegant arts and
improvements of human life; for whatever is agreeable in dress, furniture, or equipage; for architecture, statuary, painting,
and music, is to be regarded as luxury, sensuality, and ostentation, even in those whose situation allows, without any
inconvenieney, the indulgence of those passions, it is certain that luxury, sensuality, and ostentation are public benefits." If
everything is to be reprobated as luxury which exceeds what is absolutely necessary for the support of human nature, "there
is vice even in the use of a clean shirt, or of a convenient habitation.' Hence the whole point of the paradox rests on a loose
II. To turn now to the other great question of ethics, to the nature of moral approbation, and its source in the mind. 
As the different theories of the nature of virtue may all be reduced to three, so all the different theories concerning the origin
of moral approbation may be reduced to a similar number. Self-love, reason, and sentiment, are the three different sources
which have been assigned for the principle of moral approbation. According to some, we approve or disapprove of our own
actions and of those of others from self-love only, or from some view of their tendency to our own happiness or
disadvantage; according to others, we distinguish what is fit or unfit, both in actions and affections, by reason, or the same
faculty by which we distinguish truth from falsehood; and according to yet a third school, the distinction is altogether the
effect of immediate sentiment and feeling, arising from the plea sure or disgust with which certain actions or affections
According to Adam Smith, there was again some truth in each of these theories, but they each fell short of that completeness
The self-love theory, best expounded by Hobbes and Mandeville, reduced the principle of  approbation to a remote
perception of the tendency of conduct upon personal well-being; and the  merit of virtue or demerit of vice consisted in their
respectively serving to support or disturb  society, the preservation of which was so necessary to the security of individual
To this our author objects, that this perception of the good effects of virtue enhances indeed our appreciation of it, but that
it does not cause it. When the innumerable advantages of a cultivated and social life over a savage and solitary one are
described, and the necessity of virtue pointed out for the maintenance of the one, and the tendency of vice to reproduce the
other, the reader is charmed with the novelty of the observation; "he sees plainly a new beauty in virtue and a new deformity
in vice, which he had never taken notice of before; and is commonly so delighted with the discovery, that he seldom takes
time to reflect that this political view, having never occurred to him in his life before, cannot possibly be the ground of that
approbation and disapprobation with which he has always been accustomed to consider those different qualities." 
In the application of the self-love theory to our praise or blame of actions or conduct in past timeas of the virtue of Cato or
of the villany of Catilinethere was only an imaginary, not an actual, reference to self; and in praising or blaming in such
cases we thought of what might have happened to us, had we lived in those times, or of what might still happen to us if in
our own times we met with such characters. The idea which the authors of this theory "were groping about, but which they
were never able to unfold distinctly, was that indirect sympathy which we feel with the gratitude or resentment of those who
Is the principle of sympathy then a selfish principle? Is sympathy with the sorrow or indignation of another an emotion
founded on self-love, because it arises from bringing the case of another home to oneself; and then conceiving of one's own
The answer to this question is important, and is best giver in Adam Smith's own words, as he himself admits that the whole
account of human nature which deduces all sentiments and affections from self-love, seems to have arisen "from some
confused misapprehension of the system of sympathy." His answer, which is as follows, will perhaps not be thought
completely satisfactory : "Though sympathy is very properly said to arise from an imaginary change of situations with the
person principally concerned, yet this imaginary change is not supposed to happen to me in my own person and character,
but in that of the person with whom I sympathize. When I condole with you for the loss of your only son, in order to enter
into your grief I do not consider what I, a person of such a character and profession, should suffer if I had a son, and if that
son was unfortunately to die; but I consider what I should suffer if I was really you; and I not only change circumstances
with you, but I change persons and characters. My grief; therefore, is entirely upon your account, and not in the least upon
my own. It is not, therefore, in the least selfish. How can that be regarded as a selfish passion, which does not arise even
from the imagination of anything that has befallen, or that relates to myself; in my own proper person or character, but is
entirely occupied about what relates to you?" Yet if a reference to self be the fundamental fact of sympathy, it would seem
that this is equivalent to making a reference to self the foundation of all moral sentiment; as in Hobbes' explanation of pity,
that it is grief for the calamity of another, arising from the imagination of the like calamity befalling oneself. And it is
remarkable that the same passage of Polybius which has been thought to be an anticipation of the theory of sympathy,
should have also been quoted by flume, as showing that Polybius referred all our sentiments of virtue to a selfish origin. 
Next to the theory which founded moral approbation in self- love, comes that which founded it in reason. This theory
originated in the opposition to the doctrine of Hobbes, who made the laws of the civil magistrate the sole ultimate standards
of just and unjust, of right and wrongimplying the consequence, that there was no natural distinction between right and
wrong, but that they were the arbitrary creations of law. Cudworth taught, that, antecedent to all law or positive institution,
there was a faculty of the mind which distinguished moral qualities in actions and affections, and that this faculty was reason;
the same faculty that distinguished truth from falsehood, thus also distinguishing right from wrong. It became therefore the
popular doctrine, when the controversy with Hobbes was at its height, that the essence of virtue and vice did not consist in
the conformity or nonconformity of actions with the law of a superior, but in their conformity or nonconformity with reason;
In this theory also Adam Smith recognizes some elements of truth. "That virtue consists in conformity to reason is true in
some respects; and this faculty may very justly be considered as, in some sense, the source and principle of moral
approbation and disapprobation, and of all solid judgments concerning right and wrong." Induction too is one of the
operations of reason, and it is by induction and experience that the general rules of morality are formed. They are established
inductively, from the observation in a number of particular cases of what is pleasing or displeasing to our moral faculties. So
it is by reason that we discover those general rules of justice by which we ought to regulate our actions; and by the same
faculty we form those more indeterminate ideas of what is prudent, decent, generous, or noble, according to which we
endeavour to model our conduct. And as it is by these general rules, so formed by an induction of reason, that we most
regulate our moral judgments, which would be very variable if they depended merely upon feeling and sentiment, virtue may
so far be said to consist in conformity to reason, and so far may reason be considered as the source of moral approbation. 
This admission, however, is a very different thing from the supposition that our first perceptions of right and wrong can be
derived from reason. These first perceptions, upon which from a number of particular cases the general rules of morality are
founded, must be the object of an immediate souse and feeling, not of reason. "It is by finding in a vast variety of instances
that one tenor of conduct constantly pleases in a certain manner, and that another as constantly displeases the mind, that we
form the general rules of morality. But reason cannot render any particular object either agreeable or disagreeable to the
mind for its own sake. Reason may show that this object is the means of obtaining some other which is naturally either
pleasing or displeasing, and in this manner may render it either agreeable or disagreeable for the sake of something else; but
nothing can be agreeable or disagreeable for its own sake, which is not rendered such by immediate sense and feeling. If
virtue, therefore, in every particular instance, necessarily pleases for its own sake, and if vice as certainly displeases the
mind, it cannot be reason, but immediate sense and feeling which in this manner reconciles us to the one and alienates us
There remained therefore the theories which made sentiment or feeling the original source of moral approbation; and the
If the principle of approbation was founded neither on self- love nor on reason, there must be some faculty of a peculiar
kind, with which the human mind was endowed to produce the effect in question. Such a faculty was the moral sensea
particular power of perception exerted by the mind at the view of certain actions and affections, by which those that affected
the mind agreeably were immediately stamped with the characters of right, laudable, and virtuous, while those that affected
This moral sense was somewhat analagous to our external senses; for as external bodies, by affecting our senses in a certain
way, seemed to possess the different qualities of sound, taste, smell, or colour, so the various affections of the mind, by
touching the moral sense in a certain way, appeared to possess the different qualities of right or wrong, of virtue or of vice.
The moral sense too was a reflex internal sense, as distinct from a direct internal sense; that is to say, as the perception of
beauty was a reflex sense presupposing the direct sense which perceived objects and colours, so the perception of the beauty
or deformity of passions and affections was a reflex sense presupposing the perception by a direct internal sense of the
several passions and affections themselves. Other reflex senses of the same kind were, a public sense, by which we
sympathize with the happiness or misery of our fellows; a sense of shame and honour; and a sense of ridicule. 
One consequence of this analogy between the moral sense and the external senses, and a consequence drawn by Hutcheson
himself, was that our moral faculties themselves could not be  called virtuous or vicious, morally good or morally evil; for
the qualities of any object of sense  cannot be applied to the sense itself. An object may have the quality of black or white,
but the  sense of seeing is not black nor white; and in the same way, though an action or sentiment may  appear good or bad,
the qualities of goodness or badness cannot attach to the moral faculty which perceives such qualities in nature. 
Adam Smith objects to this, that we do recognize some- thing morally good in correct moral sentiments, and that we do
consider a man worthy of moral approbation whose praise and blame are always accurately suited to the value or
worthlessness of conduct. If we saw a man "shouting with admiration and applause at a barbarous and unmerited execution,
which some insolent tyrant had ordered," we should be surely justified in calling such behaviour vicious, and morally evil in
the highest degree, though it expressed nothing but a depraved state of the moral faculties. There is no perversion of
sentiment or affection we should be more averse to enter into, or reject with greater disapprobation, than one of this kind;
and so far from regarding such a state of mind as merely strange, and not at all vicious or evil, we should rather regard it "as
Nor are the difficulties less if we found the principle of moral approbation, not upon any sense analogous to the external
senses, but upon some peculiar sentiment, intended for such a purpose; if we say, for instance, that as resentment may be
called a sense of injuries, or gratitude a sense of benefits, so approbation and disapprobation, as feelings or emotions which
arise in the mind on the view of different actions and characters, may be called a sense of right and wrong, or a moral sense. 
For if approbation and disapprobation were, like gratitude or resentment, an emotion of a particular kind, distinct from every
other, whatever variations either of them might undergo we should expect them to retain clearly marked and distinguishable
general features; just as in all the variations of the emotion of anger, it is easy to distinguish the same general features. With
regard to approbation it is otherwise, for there are no common features running through all manifestations of moral
approval, or the contrary. "The approbation with which we view a tender, delicate, and humane sentiment, is quite different
from that with which we are struck by one that appears great, daring, and magnanimous. Our approbation of both may, upon
different occasions, be perfect and entire; but we are softened by the one and we are elevated by the other, and there is no
sort of resemblance between the emotions which they excite in us. And, in the same way, our horror for cruelty has no
By his own theory Adam Smith thinks that this difference in the character of approbation is more easily explained. It is
because the emotions of the person whom we approve of are different when they are humane and delicate from what they
are when they are great and daring, and because our approbation arises from sympathy with these different emotions, that
our feeling of approbation with regard to the one sentiment is so different from what it is with regard to the other. 
Moreover, not only are the different passions and affections of the human mind approved or disapproved as morally good or
evil, but the approbation or disapprobation itself is marked with the same moral attributes. The moral sense theory cannot
account for this fact; and the only explanation possible is, that, in this instance at least, the coincidence or opposition of
sentiments between the person judging and the person judged constitutes moral approbation or the contrary. When the
approbation with which our neighbour regards the conduct of another person coincides  with our own, we approve of his
approbation as in some measure morally good; and so, on the  contrary, when his sentiments differ from our own, we
If a peculiar sentiment, distinct from every other, were really the source of the principle of approbation, it is strange that
such a sentiment "should hitherto have been so little taken notice of as not to have got a name in any language. The word
`moral sense' is of very late formation, and cannot yet be considered as making part of the English tongue.... The word
`conscience' does not immediately denote any moral faculty by which we approve or disapprove. Conscience supposes,
indeed, the existence of some such faculty, and properly signifies our consciousness of having acted agreeably to its
directions. When love, hatred, joy, sorrow, gratitude, resentment, with so many other passions which are all supposed to be
the subjects of this principle, have made themselves considerable enough to get them titles to know them by, is it not
surprising that the sovereign of them all should hitherto have been so little heeded thata few philosophers excepted nobody
In opposition then to the theory which derives moral approbation from a peculiar sentiment, Adam Smith reduces it himself
to four sources, in some respects different from one another. "First, we sympathize with the motives of the agent; secondly,
we enter into the gratitude of those who receive the benefit of his actions; thirdly, we observe that his conduct has been
agreeable to the general rules by which those two sympathies generally act; and last of all, when we consider such actions as
making a part of a system of behaviour which tends to promote the happiness either of the individual or of the society, they
appear to derive a beauty from this utility not unlike that which we ascribe to any well-contrived machine." 
The result of the preceding chapter, in which the relation of Adam Smith's theory to other ethical theories has been defined,
is that it is a theory in which all that is true in the "selfish" system of Hobbes or Mandeville, in the "benevolent" system of
Hutcheson, or in the "utilitarian" system of Hume, is adopted and made use of, to form a system quite distinct from any one
of them. It seeks to bridge over their differences, by avoiding the one-sidedness of their several principles, and taking a
wider view of the facts of human nature. It is therefore, properly speaking, an Eclectic theory, if by eclecticism be
understood, not a mere commixture of different systems, but a discriminate selection of the elements of truth to be found in
The ethical writers who most influenced Adam Smith were undoubtedly Hume and Hutcheson, in the way of agreement and
difference that has been already indicated. Dugald Stewart has also drawn attention to his obligations to Butler.(8) It would
be interesting to know whether he ever read Hartley's Observations on Man, a work which, published in 1749that is, some
ten years before his ownwould have materially assisted his argument. For Adam Smith's account of the growth of
conscienceof a sense of duty, is in reality closely connected with the theory which explains its origin by the working of the
laws of association. From our experience of the constant association between the acts of others and pleasurable or painful
feelings of our own, according as we sympathize or not with them, comes the desire of ourselves causing in others similar
pleasurable, and avoiding similar painful, emotionsor in other words, that desire of praise and aversion to blame which,
refined and purified by reference to an imaginary and ideal spectator of our conduct, grows to be a conscientious and
disinterested love of virtue and detestation of vice. The rules of moral conduct, formed as they are by generalization from
particular judgments of the sympathetic instinct, or from a number of particular associations of pleasurable and painful
feelings with particular acts, are themselves directly associated with that love of praise or praise- worthiness which
originates in our longing for the same sympathy from other men with regard to ourselves that we know to be pleasurable in
the converse relation. The word "association" is never once used by Adam Smith, but it is implied at every step of his theory,
and forms really as fundamental a feature in his reasoning as it does in that of the philosopher who was the first to
investigate its laws in their application to the facts of morality. This is, perhaps, internal evidence enough that Adam Smith
But the writer who, perhaps, as much as any other contributed to the formation of Adam Smith's ideas, seems to have been
Pope, who in his Every on Man anticipated many of the leading thoughts in the Theory of Moral Sentiments. The points of
resemblance between the poet and the philosopher are frequent and obvious. There is in both the same constant appeal to
nature, and to the wisdom displayed in her laws; the same reference to self-love as the basis of the social virtues and
benevolence; the same identification of virtue with happiness; and the same depreciation of greatness and ambition as
Adam Smith's simple theory of happiness, for instance, reads like a commentary on the text supplied by Pope in the lines,  
Said in prose, the same teaching is conveyed by the philosopher: "What can be added to the happiness of the man who is in
Or, to take another instance. Adam Smith's account of the order in which individuals are recommended by nature to our care
is precisely the same as that given by Pope. Says the former: "Every man is first and principally recommended to his own
care," and, after himself, his friends, his country, or mankind become by degrees the object of his sympathies So said Pope
To turn now from the theory itself to the criticisms upon it: it may perhaps be said, that if the importance of an ethical theory
in the history of moral philosophy may be measured by the  amount of criticism expended upon it, Adam Smith's Theory of
Moral Sentiments must take its place immediately after Hume's Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals. The shorter
observations on it by Lord Kames and Sir James Mackintosh bear witness to the great interest that attached to it, no less
than the longer criticisms of Dr. Brown, Dugald Stewart, or Jouffroy, the French moral philosopher. The various objections
raised by these writers, all of whom have approached it with that impartial acuteness so characteristic of philosophers in
regard to theories not their own, will best serve to illustrate what have been considered the weak points in the general theory
proposed by Adam Smith. But in following the main current of such criticism, it is only fair that we should try in some
measure to hold the scales between the critics and their author, and to weigh the value of the arguments that have been
First of all, it is said that the resolution of all moral approbation into sympathy really makes morality dependent on the
mental constitution of each individual, and so sets up a variable standard, at the mercy of personal influences and local
custom. Adam Smith says expressly indeed, that there is no other measure of moral conduct than the sympathetic
approbation of each individual. "Every faculty in one man is the measure by which he judges of the like faculty iu another ;"
and as he judges of other men's power of sight or hearing by reference to his own, so he judges of their love, resentment, or
Is not this to destroy the fixed character of morality, and to deprive itas Protagoras, the Greek sophist, deprived it long ago
in his similar teaching that man was the measure of all thingsof its most ennobling qualities, its eternity and immutability? Is
it not to reduce the rules of morality to the level merely of the rules of etiquette? Is it not to make our standard of conduct
dependent merely on the ideas and passions of those we happen to live with? Does it not justify Brown's chief objection to
Adam Smith's answer to this might have been, that the consideration of the basis of morality lay beyond the scope of his
inquiry, and that, if he explained the principle of moral approbation by the laws of sympathy he appealed to, the facts
commanded acceptance, whatever the consequences might be. He would have reasserted confidently, that no case of
approbation occurred without a tacit reference to the sympathy of the approver; and that the feeling of  approbation or the
contrary always varied exactly with the degree of sympathy or antipathy felt  for the agent. Therefore, if as a matter of fact
every case of such approbation implied a reference  to the feelings of the individual person approving, then those feelings
were the source of moral  judgment, however variable or relative morality might thus be made to appear. 
  He would also have denied that the consequence of his theory did really in any way  weaken the basis of morality, or
deprive it of its obligatory power over our conduct. The assertion  of such a consequence has been perhaps the most
persistent objection raised against his system.  Sir James Mackintosh, for instance, makes the criticism, that "the sympathies
have nothing more  of an imperative character than any other emotions. They attract or repel, like other feelings,  according
to their intensity. If, then, the sympathies continue in mature minds to constitute the  whole of conscience, it becomes utterly
impossible to explain the character of command and  supremacy, which is attested by the unanimous voice of mankind to
belong to that faculty, and to  form its essential distinction."(10) But as, of all Adam Smith's critics, Jouffroy has been the one
who has urged this argument with the greatest force, it will be best to follow his reasoning, before considering the force of
According to him, no more moral authority can attach to the instinct of sympathy than can attach to any other instinct of our
nature. The desire of sympathy, being simply an instinct, can have no claim to prevail over the impulses of our other
instincts, whenever they happen to come into conflict, than such as is founded on its possible greater strength. For instance,
the instinct of self-love often comes into conflict with, and often prevails over, the instinct of sympathy, the motive of
self-interest well-understood being thus superior to our sympathetic impulses both in fact and by right. If then there is a
superiority in the instinct of sympathy above all our other instincts, it must come from a judgment of reason, decisive of its
title; but since such decision of reason implies a reference to some rule other and higher than instinct, our motive in
preferring the inspirations of instinctive sympathy to all other impulses must be derived from this higher motive, or, in other
words, from reason and not from instinct. Hence, since the sympathetic instinct bears no signs of an authority superior to
that of other instincts, there is no real authority in the motive which, according to Adam Smith, impels us to right conduct.
Instead of proving that the instinct of sympathy is the true moral motive, Adam Smith describes truly and beautifully the
characteristics of this moral motive, and then gratuitously attributes them to the instinct of sympathy. But he fails to apply to
rules of conduct founded upon such an instinct, that which is the special characteristic of the moral motive, namely, that it
alone is obligatoryalone presents us, as an end to be pursued, an end which ought to be pursued, as distinct from other ends
suggested by other motives, which may be pursued or not as we please. "Among all possible motives, the moral motive
Jouffroy applies the same reasoning to Adam Smith's explanation of our moral ideas, those, for example, of Right and Duty.
For if the motive of sympathy bears with it no authority, it is evident that it cannot explain ideas both of which imply and
involve a motive of obligation. If duty is obedience to rules of conduct that have been produced by sympathy, and these
rules are only generalizations of particular judgments of instinctive sympathy, it is plain that the authority of these rules can
be no greater than that of the judgments which originally gave rise to them. If it is equally a duty to obey the instinct as to
obey the rules it gives rise to, it is superfluous to explain duty as a sense of the authority of these rules, seeing that it is
already involved in the process of their formation. And if again it can never be a duty to obey the instinct, because neither its
direction nor the desire of sympathy which impels us to follow it can ever be obligatory, it can none the more be a duty to
obey the rules which are founded upon the instinct. The authority of the moral rules or principles of conduct stands or falls
with the authority of the instinct; for if the latter can enforce obligation to a certain degree, it can enforce it in all degrees;
and if it cannot enforce it to this degree, then it cannot in any. It is therefore Jouffroy's conclusion, that "there is not, in the
system of Smith, any such thing as a moral law; and it is incompetent to explain our ideas of duty, of right, and of all other
The question then is, How far is such criticism well-founded? How far is it relevant to the subject-matter of Adam Smith's
Adam Smith might have replied to Jouffroy's objections by asking whether, putting aside the question of the soundness of
his theory of the origin of moral approbation, any theory that accounted for the approbation did not ipso facto account for
the obligation. He might have said that, if he showed why one course of conduct was regarded as good and another as bad,
he implicitly showed why one course was felt to be right and the other to be wrongwhy it was felt, that one course ought to
be followed and the other course ought to be avoided. For the feeling of authority and obligation is involved in the fact of
approbation. As it has been well put by Brown, "The very conceptions of the rectitude, the obligation, the approvableness
(of certain actions) are involved in the feeling of the approbation itself. It is impossible for us to have the feeling, and not to
have these.....  To know that we should feel ourselves unworthy of self-esteem, and objects rather of self-abhorrence, if we
did not act in a certain manner, is to feel the moral obligation to act in a certain manner, as it is to feel the moral rectitude of
the action itself. We are so constituted that it is impossible for us, in certain circumstances, not to have this feeling; and
Moreover, Adam Smith expressly pointed out that the difference between moral approbation and approbation of all other
kinds lay in the impossibility of our being as indifferent about conduct as about other things, because conduct, either directly
or by our imagination, affected ourselves; so that the additional strength thus conferred on the feeling of moral approbation
was quite sufficient to account for that feeling of the imperative and obligatory force which inculcates obedience to moral
rules. If there is no authority in an instinct per se, it may nevertheless be so constituted and may so operate that the strictest
sense of duty may ultimately grow from it and upon it. The obligation is none the less real because it can be accounted for;
nor are the claims of duty any the less substantial because they are capable of being traced to so humble a beginning as an
It may therefore be said, on behalf of Adam Smith, that it is not to weaken the basis of morality, nor the authority of
conscience, to trace either of them to their sources in sentiments of sympathy, originally influenced by pleasure and pain.
The obligatory nature of moral rules remains a fact, which no theory of their origin can alter or modify; just as benevolent
affections remain facts of our moral being, irrespective of their possible superstructure on instincts of self-interest. If con-
science is explicable as a kind of generalization or summary of moral sympathies, formed by the observation of the
distribution of praise or blame in a number of particular instances and by personal experience of many years, its influence
need be none the less great nor its control any the less authoritative than if it were proved to demonstration to be a primary
It is also necessary to remember that Adam Smith carefully restricted the feeling of obligation to the one single virtue of
justice, and throughout his treatise avoided generally the use of words which, like "right" and "wrong," seem to suggest the
idea of obligation. By the use of the words "proper" and "improper," or "meritorious," as applied to sentiments and conduct,
he seems to have wished to convey the idea that he did regard morality as relative to time, place, and circumstance, as to a
certain extent due to custom and convention, and not as absolute, eternal, or immutable. Properly speaking, justice, or the
abstinence from injury to others, was, he held, the only virtue which, as men had a right to exact it from us, it was our duty
to practise towards them. The consciousness that force might be employed to make us act according to the rules of justice,
but not according to the rules of any other virtues, such as friendship, charity, or generosity, was the source of the stricter
obligation felt by us in reference to the virtue of justice. "We feel ourselves," he said, "to be in a peculiar manner tied,
bound, and obliged to the observation of justice," whilst the practice of the other virtues "seems to be left in some measure
to our own choice." "In the practice of the other virtues, our conduct should rather be directed by a certain kind of
propriety, by a certain taste for a particular tenor of conduct, than by any regard to a precise rule or maxim;" but it is
otherwise with regard to justice, all the rules of which are precise, definite, and certain, and alone admit of no exception. 
As to the authority of our moral faculties, of our perception, howsoever derived, of different qualities in conduct, it is, in
Adam Smith's system, an ultimate fact, as indisputable as the authority of other faculties over their respective objects; for
example, as the authority of the eye about beauty of colour, or as that of the ear about harmony of sounds. "Our moral
faculties, our natural sense of merit and propriety," approve or disapprove of actions instantaneously, and this approval or
judgment is their peculiar function. They judge of the other faculties and principles of our nature; how far, for example, love
or resentment ought either to be indulged or restrained, and when the various senses ought to be gratified. Hence they
cannot be said to be on a level with our other natural faculties and appetites, and endowed with no more right to restrain the
latter than the latter are to restrain them. There can be no more appeal from them about their objects than there is from the
eye, or the ear, or the taste with regard to the objects of their several jurisdictions. According as anything is agreeable or not
to them, is it fit, right, and proper, or unfit, wrong, and improper. "The sentiments which they approve of are graceful and
becoming; the contrary, ungraceful and unbecoming. The very words, right, wrong, fit, proper, graceful, or becoming, mean
Hence the question of the authority of our moral faculties is as futile as the question of the authority of the special senses
over their several objects. For "they carry along with them the most evident badges of this authority, which denote that they
were set up within us to be the supreme arbiter of all our actions, to superintend all our senses, passions, and appetites, and
to judge how far either of them was either to be indulged or restrained." That is to say, it is impossible for our moral
faculties to approve of one course of conduct and to disapprove of another, and at the same time to feel that there is no
Perhaps the part of Adam Smith's theory which has given least satisfaction is his account of the ethical standard, or measure
of moral actions. This, it will be remembered, is none other than the sympathetic emotion of the impartial spectatorwhich
seems again to resolve itself into the voice of public opinion. It will be of interest to follow some of the criticism that has
If impartiality means, argues Jouffroy, as alone it can mean impartiality of judgment, the impartiality of a spectator must be
the impartiality of his reason, which rises superior to the suggestions of his instincts or passions; but if so, a moral judgment
no longer arises from a mere instinct of sympathy, but from an operation of reason. If instinct is adopted as our rule of moral
conduct, there must be some higher rule by which we make choice of some impulses against the influence of others; and the
impartiality requisite in sympathy is itself a recognition of the insufficiency of instinctive feelings to supply moral rules. 
It may be said, in reply to this, that by impartiality Adam Smith meant neither an impartiality of reason nor of instinct, but
simply the indifference or coolness of a mind that feels not the full strength of the original passion, which it shares, and
which it shares in a due and just degree precisely because it feels it not directly but by reflection. If the resentment of A. can
only fairly be estimated by the power of B. to sympathize with it, the latter is only impartial in so far as his feeling of
resentment is reflected and not original. His feeling of approbation or disapprobation of A's resentment need be none the less
a feeling, none the less instinctive and emotional, because he is exempt from the vividness of the passion as it affects his
friend. It is simply that exemption, Adam Smith would say, which enables him to judge; and whether his judgment is for that
reason to be considered final and right or not, it is, as a matter of fact, the only way in which a moral judgment is possible at
The next objection of Jouffroy, that the sympathy of an impartial spectator affords only variable rules of morality, Adam
Smith would have met by the answer, that the rules of morality are to a certain extent variable, and dependent on custom.
Jouffroy supposes himself placed as an entire stranger in the presence of a quantity of persons of different ages, sexes, and
professions, and then asks, how should he judge of the propriety of any emotion on his part by reference to the very different
sympathies which such an emotion would arouse. Lively sensibilities would partake of his emotions vividly, cold ones but
feebly. The sympathies of the men would be different from those of the women, those of the young from those of the old,
those of the merchant from those of the soldier, and so forth. To this it might fairly be replied, that as a matter of fact there
are very few emotions with which different people do not sympathize in very different degrees, and of which accordingly
they do not entertain very different feelings of moral approbation or the reverse. Each man's sympathy is in fact his only
measure of the propriety of other men's sentiments, and for that reason it is that there is scarcely any single moral action of
which any two men adopt the same moral sentiment. That morality is relative and not absolute, Adam Smith nowhere denies.
Nevertheless, he would say, there is sufficient uniformity in the laws of sympathy, directed and controlled as they are by
custom, to make the rule of general sympathy or of the abstract spectator a sufficiently permanent standard of conduct. 
It is moreover a fact, which no one has explained better than Adam Smith, in his account of the growth in every individual of
the virtue of self-command, that though our moral estimate of our own conduct begins by reference to the sympathy of
particular individuals, our parents, schoolfellows, or others, we yet end by judging ourselves, not by reference to any one in
particular so much as from an abstract idea of general approbation or the contrary, derived from our experience of particular
judgments in the course of our life. This is all that is meant by "the abstract spectator," reference to whom is simply the same
as reference to the supposed verdict of public opinion. If we have done anything wrong, told a lie, for example, the
self-condemnation we pass on ourselves is the condemnation of public opinion, with which we identify ourselves by long
force of habit; and had we never heard a lie condemned, nor known it punished, we should feel no self-condemnation
whatever in telling one. We condemn it, not by reference, as Jouffroy puts it, to the feelings of John or Peter, but by
reference to the feelings of the general world, which we know to be made up of people like John and Peter. There is nothing
inconsistent therefore in the notion of an abstract spectator, "who has neither the prejudices of the one nor the weaknesses
of the other, and who sees correctly and soundly precisely because he is abstract." The identification of this abstract
spectator with conscience, is so far from being, as Jouffroy says it is, a departure from, and an abandonment of the rule of
sympathy, that it is its logical and most satisfactory development. There is no reason to repeat the process by which the
perception of particular approving sympathies passes into identification with the highest rules of morality and the most
sacred dictates of religion. By reference to his own experience, every reader may easily test for himself the truth or falsity of
It is said with truth, that to make the judgment of an impartial or abstract spectator the standard of morality is to make no
security against fallibility of judgment; and that such a judgment is only efficacious where there is tolerable unanimity, but
that it fails in the face of possible differences of opinion. But this objection is equally true of any ethical standard ever yet
propounded in the world, whether self- interest, the greatest possible happiness, the will of the sovereign, the fitness of
things, or any other principle is suggested as the ultimate test of rectitude of conduct. This part of the theory may claim,
therefore, not only to be as good as any other theory, but to be in strict keeping with the vast amount of variable moral
In further disproof of Adam Smith's theory, Jouffroy appeals to consciousness. We are not conscious, he says, in judging of
the acts of others, that we measure them by reference to our ability to sympathize with them. So far are we from doing this,
that we consider it our first duty to stifle our emotions of sympathy or antipathy, in order to arrive at an impartial judgment.
As regards our own emotions, also, there is no such recourse to the sympathies of others; and even when there is, we often
prefer our own judgment after all to that which we know to be the judgment of others. Consciousness therefore attests the
falsity of the theory that we seek in our own sensibility the judgments we pass upon others, or that we seek in the opinions
The truth of the fact stated in this objection may evidently be conceded, and yet the validity of the main theory be left
untouched. The latter is a theory mainly of the origin of moral feelings, and of their growth; and emotions of sympathy
which originally give rise to moral feelings may well disappear and be absent when long habit has once fixed them in the
mind. It is quite conceivable, for instance, that if we originally derived our moral notions of our own conduct from constant
observation of the conduct of others, we might yet come to judge ourselves by a standard apparently unconnected with any
reference to other people, and yet really made up of a number of forgotten judgments passed by us upon them. Children are
always taught to judge them- selves by appeals to the sentiments of their parents or other relations about their conduct; and
though the standard of morality, thus external at first, may in time come to be internal, and even to be more potent than
when it was external, it none the more follows that recourse to such sympathy never took place because it ceases to take
place or to be noticed when the moral sentiments are fully formed. In learning to read and write, an exactly analogous
process may be traced. The letters which so painfully affected our consciousness at first, when we had to make constant
reference to the alphabet, cease at last to affect it at all; yet the process of spelling really goes on in the mind in every word
we read or write, however unconscious we may be of its operation. Habit and experience, says Adam Smith, teach us so
easily and so readily to view our own interests and those of others from the standpoint of a third person, that "we are scarce
Then again, the question has been raised, Is it true that sympathy with an agent or with the object of his action is a necessary
It is objected, for instance, by Brown, that sympathy is not a perpetual accompaniment of our observation of all the actions
that take place in life, and that many cases occur in which we feel approval or disapproval, in which consequently moral
estimates are made, and yet without any preceding sympathy or antipathy. "In the number of petty affairs which are hourly
before our eyes, what sympathy is felt," he asks, "either with those who are actively or with those who are passively
concerned, when the agent himself performs his little offices with emotions as slight as those which the objects of his actions
reciprocally feel? Yet in these cases we are as capable of judging, and approve or disapprovenot with the same liveliness of
emotion indeed, but with as accurate estimation of merit or demeritas when we consider the most heroic sacrifices which
the virtuous can make, or the most atrocious crimes of which the sordid and the cruel can be guilty." There must be the
same sympathy in the case of the humblest action we denominate right as in that of the most glorious action; yet such actions
often excite no sympathy whatever. Unless therefore the common transactions of life are to be excluded altogether from
morality, from the field of right and wrong, it is impossible to ascribe such moral qualities to them, if sympathy is the source
To this objection, founded on the non-universality of sympathy, and on its not being coextensive with feelings of moral
approbation, Adam Smith might have replied, that there was no action, howsoever humble, denominated right, in which
there was not or had not been to start with a reference to sentiments of sympathy. It is impossible to conceive any case in the
most trivial department of life in which approbation on the ground of goodness may not be explained by reference to such
feelings. Brown himself lays indeed less stress on this argument than on another which has, it must be confessed, much
That is, that the theory of sympathy assumes as already existing those moral feelings which it professes to explain. If, he
says, no moral sentiments preceded a feeling of sym- pathy, the latter could no more produce them than a mirror, without
If we had no principle of moral approbation previous to sympathy, the most perfect sympathy or accordance of passions
would prove nothing more than a mere agreement of feeling; nor should we be aware of anything more than in any case of
coincidence of feeling with regard to mere objects of taste, such as a picture or an air of music. It is not because we
sympathize with the sentiments of an agent that we account them moral, but it is because his moral sentiments agree with
our own that we sympathize with them. The morality is there before the sympathy. If we regard sentiments which differ from
our own, not merely as unlike our own, but as morally improper and wrong, we must first have conceived our own to be
morally proper and right, by which we measure those of others. Without this previous belief in the moral propriety of our
own sentiments, we could never judge of the propriety or impropriety of others, nor regard them as morally unsuitable to the
circumstances out of which they arose. Hence the sympathy from which we are said to derive our notions of propriety or the
A similar criticism Brown also applies to that sympathy with the gratitude of persons who have received benefits or injuries
which is said to be the source of feelings of merit and demerit. If it is true that our sense of the merit of an agent is due to
our sympathy with the gratitude of those he has benefited  if the sympathy only transfuses into our own breasts the
gratitude or resentment of persons so affected, it is evident that our reflected gratitude or resentment can only give rise to
the same sense of merit or demerit that has been already involved in the primary and direct gratitude or resentment. "If our
reflex gratitude and resentment involve notions of merit and demerit, the original gratitude and resentment which we feel by
reflexion must in like manner have involved them. . . . But if the actual gratitude or resentment of those who have profited or
suffered imply no feelings of merit or demerit, we may be certain, at least, that in whatever source we are to strive to
discover those feelings, it is not in the mere reflexion of a fainter gratitude or resentment that we can hope to find them. . . .
The feelings with which we sympathize are themselves moral feelings or sentiments; or if they are not moral feelings, the
Unless therefore we already possessed moral feelings of our own, the most exact sympathy of feelings could do no more
than tell us of the similarity of our own feelings to those of some other person, which they might equally do whether they
were vicious or virtuous; and in the same way, the most complete dissonance of feeling could supply us with no more than a
consciousness of the dissimilarity of our emotions. As a coincidence of taste with regard to a work of art pre-sup poses in
any two minds similarly affected by it an independent susceptibility of emotions, distinguishing what is beautiful from what is
ugly, irrespectively of others being present to share them; so a coincidence of feeling with regard to any moral action
pre-supposes an independent capacity in the two minds similarly affected by them of distinguishing what is right from what is
wrong, a capacity which each would have singly, irrespectively of all reference to the feelings of the other. There is
something more that we recognize in our moral sentiments than the mere coincidence of feeling recognized in an agreement
of taste or opinion. We feel that a person has acted not merely as we should have done, and that his motives have been
It is perhaps best to state Brown's criticism in his own words: "All which is peculiar to the sympathy is, that instead of one
mind only affected with certain feelings, there are two minds affected with certain feelings, and a recognition of the similarity
of these feelings; a similarity which far from being confined to our moral emotions, may occur as readily and as frequently in
every other feeling of which the mind is susceptible. What produces the moral notions there- fore must evidently be
something more than a recognition of similarity of feeling which is thus common to feelings of every class. There must be an
independent capacity of moral emotion, in consequence of which we judge those sentiments of conduct to be right which
coincide with sentiments of conduct previously recognized as rightor the sentiments of others to be improper, because they
are not in unison with those which we previously recognized as proper. Sympathy then may be the diffuser of moral
sentiments, as of various other feelings; but if no moral sentiments exist previously to our sympathy, our sympathy itself
The same inconsistency Brown detects in Adam Smith's theory of moral sentiments relating to our own conduct, according
to which it would be impossible for us to distinguish without reference to the feelings of a real or imaginary spectator any
difference of propriety or impropriety, merit or demerit, in our own actions or character. If an impartial spectator can thus
discover merit or demerit in us by making our case his own and assuming our feelings, those feelings which he thus makes
his own must surely speak to us to the same purpose, and with even greater effect than they speak to him. In no case then
can sympathy give any additional knowledge: it can only give a wider diffusion to feelings which already exist. 
It is therefore, according to Brown, as erroneous in ethics to ascribe moral feelings to sympathy, or the mental reflection by
which feelings are diffused, as it would be, in a theory of the source of light, to ascribe light itself to the reflection which
involves its existence. "A mirror presents to us a fainter copy of external things; but it is a copy which it presents. We are in
like manner to each other mirrors that reflect from breast to breast, joy, sorrow, indignation, and all the vivid emotions of
which the individual mind is susceptible; but though, as mirrors, we mutually give and receive emotions, these emotions
The objection contained in this analogy of the mirror is perhaps more fatal to the truth of Adam Smith's theory than any
other. If a passion arises in every one analogous to, though weaker than, the original passion of the person primarily affected
by it; if, for instance, by this force of fellow-feeling we enter into or approve of another person's resentment or gratitude; it
seems clear that the original gratitude or resentment must itself involve, irrespective of all sympathy, those feelings of moral
approbation, or the contrary, which it is asserted can only arise by sympathy. It is impossible to state this objection more
clearly than in the words already quoted from Brown. But when the latter insists on the irregular nature of sympathy as the
basis of moralityon its tendency to vary even in the same individual many times in the day, so that what was virtuous in the
morning might seem vicious at noon, it is impossible to recognize the justice of the criticism. Adam Smith might fairly have
replied, that the educational forces of life, which are comprised in ordinary circumstances and surroundings, and which
condition all sympathy, were sufficiently uniform in character to ensure tolerable uniformity in the result, and to give to our
notions of morality all that appearance of certainty and sameness which undoubtedly belongs to them. 
Adam Smith seems himself to have anticipated one of the difficulties raised in Brown's criticism, namely, the relation of
moral approbation to the approbation of another person's taste or opinions. Why should the feeling of approbation be of a
different kind when we sympathize with a person's sentiments or actions than when we sympathize with his intellectual
judgments? The feeling of sympathy being the same in either case, why should the feeling of resultant approbation be
No one could state more clearly than does Adam Smith the analogy there is between coincidence of moral sentiment and
coincidence of intellectual opinion; nor is anything more definite in his theory than that approval of the moral sentiments of
others, like approval of their opinions, means nothing more than their agreement with our own. The following are his words:
"To approve of another man's opinions is to adopt those opinions, and to adopt them is to approve of them. If the same
arguments which convince you convince me likewise, I necessarily approve of your conviction; and if they do not, I
necessarily disapprove of it; neither can I possibly conceive that I should do the one without the other. To approve or
disapprove, therefore, of the opinions is acknowledged by everybody to mean no more than to observe their agreement or
disagreement with our own. But this is equally the case with regard to our approbation or disapprobation of the sentiments
Whence, then, comes the stronger feeling of approbation in the case of agreement of sentiments than in that of agreement of
opinion? Why do we esteem a man whose moral sentiments seem to accord with our own, whilst we do not necessarily
esteem him simply for the accordance of his opinions with our own? Why in the one case do we ascribe to him the quality of
rightness or rectitude, and in the other only the qualities of good taste or good judgment? To quote Brown once more: "If
mere accordance of emotion imply the feeling of moral excellence of any sort, we should certainly feel a moral regard for all
whose taste coincides with ours; yet, however gratifying the sympathy in such a case may be, we do not feel, in consequence
Adam Smith's answer is, that matters of intellectual agreement touch us much less nearly than circumstances of behaviour
which affect ourselves or the person we judge of; that we look at such things as the size of a mountain or the expression of a
picture from the same point of view, and therefore that we agree or disagree without that imaginary change of situation
which is the foundation of moral sympathy. The stronger feeling of approbation in the one case than in the other arises from
the personal element, which influences our judgment of another person's conduct, and which is absent in our judgment of his
"Though," he says, "you despise that picture, or that poem, or even that system of philosophy which I admire, there is little
danger of our quarrelling upon that account. Neither of us can reasonably be much interested about them. They ought all of
them to be matters of great indifference to us both; so that, though our opinions may be opposite, our affections may still be
very nearly the same. But it is quite otherwise with regard to those objects by which either you or I are particularly affected.
Though your judgments in matters of speculation, though your sentiments in matters of taste, are quite opposite to mine, I
can easily overlook this opposition; and, if I have any degree of temper, I may still find some entertainment in your
conversation, even upon those very subjects. But if you have either no fellow-feeling for the misfortunes I have met with, or
none which bears any proportion to the grief which distracts me; or if you have either no indignation at the injuries I have
suffered, or none that bears any proportion to the resentment which transports me, we can no longer converse upon these
subjects. We become intolerable to one another. I can neither support your company, nor you mine. You are confounded at
Accordingly, we only regard the sentiments which we share as moral, or the contrary, when they affect another person or
ourselves in a peculiar manner; when they bear no relation to either of us, no moral propriety is recognized in a mere
agreement of feeling. It is obvious that this explanation, to which Brown pays no attention whatever, is satisfactory to a
certain point. A plain, or a mountain, or a picture, are matters about which it is intelligible that agreement or difference
should give rise to very different feelings from those produced by a case of dishonesty, excessive anger, or untruthfulness.
Being objects so different in their nature, it is only natural that they should give rise to very different sentiments.
Independently of all sympathy, admiration of a picture or a mountain is a very different thing from admiration of a generous
action or a display of courage. The language of all men has observed the difference, and the admiration in the one case is
with perfect reason called moral, to distinguish it from the admiration which arises in the other. But when Adam Smith
classes "the conduct of a third person" among things which, like the beauty of a plain or the size of a mountain, need no
imaginary change of situation on the part of observers to be approved of by them, he inadvertently deserts his own principle,
which, if this were true, would fail to account for the approbation of actions done long ago, in times or places unrelated to
But, even if Adam Smith's explanation with regard to the difference of approbation felt where conduct is concerned from
that felt in matters of taste or opinion be accepted as satisfactory, it is strange that he should not have seen the difficulty of
accounting by his theory for the absence of anything like moral approbation in a number of cases where sympathy none the
less strongly impels us to share and enter into the emotions of another person. For instance, if we see a man in imminent
danger of his lifepursued by a bull or seeming to fall from a tight ropethough we may fully sympathize with his real or
pretended fear, in neither case do we for that reason morally approve of it. In the same way, we may sympathize with or
enter into any other emotion he manifests his love, his hope, or his joywithout any the more approving them or passing any
judgment on them whatever. Sympathy has been well defined as "a species of involuntary imitation of the displays of feeling
enacted in our presence, which is followed by the rise of the feelings themselves."(13) Thus we become affected with
whatever the mental state may be that is manifested by the expressed feelings of another person; but unless his emotion
already contains the element of moral approbation, or the contrary, as in a case of gratitude or resentment, the mere fact of
sympathy will no more give rise to it than will sympathy with another person's fear give rise to any moral approval of it. It is
evident, therefore, that sympathy does not necessarily involve approbation, and that it only involves moral approbation
What, then, is the real relation between sympathy and approbation? and to what extent is the fact, of sympathy an
It is difficult to read Adam Smith's account of the identification of sympathy and approbation, without feeling that
throughout his argument there is an unconscious play upon words, and that an equivocal use of the word "sympathy" lends
all its speciousness to the theory he expounds. The first meaning of the word sympathy is fellow-feeling, or the participation
of another person's emotion, in which sense we may be said to sympathize with another person's hope or fear; the second
meaning contains the idea of approval or praise, in which sense we may be said to sympathize with another person's
gratitude or resentment. Adam Smith begins by using the word sympathy in its first and primary sense, as meaning
participation in another person's feelings, and then proceeds to use it in its secondary and less proper sense, in which the idea
of approbation is involved. But the sympathy in the one case is totally different from the sympathy in the other. In the one
case a mere state of feeling is intended, in the other a judgment of reason. To share another person's feeling belongs only to
our sensibility; to approve of it as proper, good, and right, implies the exercise of our intelligence. To employ the word
"sympathy" in its latter use (as it is sometimes employed in popular parlance) is simply to employ it as a synonym for
"approbation;" so that sympathy, instead of being really the source of approbation, is only another word for that approbation
itself. To say that we approve of another person's sentiments when we sympathize with them is, therefore, nothing more than
It cannot therefore be said that Adam Smith's attempt to trace the feeling of moral approbation to emotions of sympathy is
altogether successful, incontestable as is the truth of his appli- cation of it to many of the phenomena of life and conduct.
Yet although sympathy is not the only factor in moral approbation, it is one that enters very widely into the growth of our
moral perceptions. It plays, for instance, an important part in evolving in us that sense of right and wrong which is generally
known as Conscience or the Moral Faculty. It is one of the elements, just as self-love is another, in that ever-forming chain
of association which goes to distinguish one set of actions as good from another set of actions as bad. Our observation in
others of the same outward symptoms which we know in our own case to attend joy or grief, pleasure or pain, leads us by
the mere force of the remembrance of our own pleasures and pains, and independently of any control of our will, to enter
Sympathy accordingly is the source of all disinterested motives in action, of our readiness to give up pleasures and incur
pains for the sake of others; and Adam Smith was so far right, that he established, by reference to this force of our
sympathetic emotions, the reality of a disinterested element as the foundation of our benevolent affections. In the same way,
self-love is the source of all the prudential side of morality; and to the general formation of our moral sentiments, all our
other emotions, such as anger, fear, love, contribute together with sympathy, in lesser perhaps but considerable degree.
Although any action that hurts another person may so affect our natural sympathy as to give rise to the feeling of
disapprobation involved in sympathetic resentment, and although an action that is injurious to ourselves may also be
regarded with similar feelings of dislike, the constant pressure of authority, exercised as it is by domestic education, by
government, by law, and by punishment, must first be brought to bear on such actions before the feeling of moral
disapprobation can arise with regard to them. The association of the pain of punishment with certain actions, and the
association of the absence of such pain (a negative pleasure) with certain others, enforces the natural dictates of our
sympathetic or selfish emotions, and impresses on them the character of morality, of obligation, and of duty. The association
is so close and constant, that in course of time the feeling of the approbation or disapprobation of certain actions becomes
perfectly independent of the various means, necessary at first to enforce or to prevent them; just as in many other cases our
In this way the feeling of moral approbation is seen to be the product of time and slow growth of circumstance, a
phenomenon to which both reason and sentiment contribute in equal shares in accordance with the laws that condition their
development. Moral approbation is no more given instantaneously by sympathy than it is given instantaneously by a moral
sense. Sympathy is merely one of the conditions under which it is evolved, one of the feelings which assist in its formation. It
is indeed the feeling on which, more than on any other, the moral agencies existing in the world build up and confirm the
notions of right and wrong; but it does of itself nothing more than translate feelings from one mind to another, and unless
there is a pre-existent moral element in the feeling so translated, the actual passage will not give rise to it. Sympathy enables
one man's fear, resentment, or gratitude to become another man's fear, resentment, or gratitude; but the feeling of moral
approbation which attends emotions so diffused, arises from reference to ideas otherwise derived than from a purely
involuntary sympathyfrom reference, that is, to a standard set up by custom and opinion. A child told for the first time of a
murder might so far enter by sympathy into the resentment of the victim as to feel indignation prompting him to vengeance;
but his idea of the murder itself as a wrong and wicked acthis idea of it as a deed morally worse than the slaughter of a
sheep by a butcher, would only arise as the result of the various forces of education, availing themselves of the original law
of sympathy, by which an act disagreeable to ourselves seems disagreeable in its application to others. And what is true in
this case, the extreme form of moral disapprobation, is no less true in all the minor cases, in which approbation or the
The feeling of moral approbation is therefore much more complex than it is in Adam Smith's theory. Above all things it is
one and indivisible, and it is impossible to distinguish our moral judgments of ourselves from our judgments of others. There
is an obvious inconsistency in saying that we can only judge of other people's sentiments and actions by reference to our
own power to sympathize with them, and yet that we can only judge of our own by reference to the same power in them.
The moral standard cannot primarily exist in ourselves, and yet, at the same time, be only derivable from without. If by the
hypothesis moral feelings relating to ourselves only exist by prior reference to the feelings of others, how can we at the same
But although the two sides of moral feeling are thus really indistinguishable, the feeling of self-approbation or the contrary
may indeed be so much stronger than our feeling of approval or disapproval of others as to justify the application to it of
such terms as Conscience, Shame, Remorse. The difference of feeling, however, is only one of degree, and in either case,
whether our own conduct or that of others is under review, the moral feeling that arises is due to the force of education and
opinion acting upon the various emotions of our nature. For instance, a Mohammedan woman seen without a veil would
have the same feeling of remorse or of moral disapprobation with regard to herself that she would have with regard to any
other woman whom she might see in the same condition, though of course in a less strong degree. In either case her feeling
would be a result of all the complex surroundings of her life, which is meant by education in its broadest sense. Sympathy
itself would be insufficient to explain the feeling, though it might help to explain how it was developed. All that sympathy
could do would be to extend the dread of punishment associated by the woman herself with a breach of the law, to all
women who might offend in a similar way; the original feeling of time immorality of exposure being accountable for in no
other way than by its association with punishment, ordained by civil or religious law, or by social custom, and enforced by
the discipline of early home life. It is obvious that the same explanation applies to all cases in which moral disapprobation is

=======================================================
Adam Smith was born on June 15, 1965, in Washington, D.C. Adopted as an infant, he was raised in SeaTac, Washington where his father, Ben, worked as a ramp serviceman at SeaTac Airport and was active in the local Machinists’ Union. His mother, Leila, stayed at home, raising Adam and his two brothers. Adam attended Bow Lake Elementary, Chinook Middle School, and Tyee High School, graduating from Tyee in 1983.
After a year at Western Washington University, Adam transferred to Fordham University, where he worked his way through college loading trucks for United Parcel Service and graduated in 1987 with a degree in Political Science. Following his graduation, Adam attended the University Of Washington School Of Law, and earned his law degree in 1990. He later worked in both private and public practice, first as a lawyer at Cromwell, Mendoza and Belur in 1992, and then as a prosecutor for the City of Seattle from 1993-1995. As a prosecutor, Adam focused on drunk driving and domestic violence cases, and in 1996, went on to work as a judge pro tempore.
During his final year at UW, Adam decided to run for the State Senate in the 33rd Legislative District, where he grew up. He campaigned door to door, eventually doorbelling the entire district twice and defeating the 16 year incumbent in the 1990 election. When he took office in January 1991, Adam was 25 years old and the youngest State Senator in the country. While in the State Senate, Adam served on the Education and Law and Justice Committees, and served as Chair of the Law and Justice Committee from 1993-1997. Despite the strong Republican tide in 1994, Adam was re-elected to the State Senate in 1994 and his victory helped the Democrats retain control of the State Senate by one seat. During his time in the State Senate, Adam developed a reputation as a moderate Democrat, with a thoughtful and common sense approach to governance.
Now in his 9th term, Adam serves as Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Committee, where he is a strong advocate for our military personnel and their families. Adam is also committed to providing our military personnel with the best equipment available to carry out their current and future missions while ensuring that the Pentagon spends taxpayer dollars in the most efficient and effective manner. This includes carefully examining our current policies and working to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse.  
Having served on the on the House Armed Services Committee since 1997, Adam formerly chaired the subcommittee on Air and Land Forces (ALF), which has jurisdiction over all Army and nearly all Air Force acquisition programs. Prior to serving as Chair of ALF, Adam chaired the Terrorism, Unconventional Threats and Capabilities subcommittee, which oversees the United States Special Operations Forces and counter-terrorism policy, among other critical areas. Adam has also previously served on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. 
Given his current and previous committee assignments and extensive travel, Adam has unique insights into today’s foremost national security issues throughout the Middle East, including the war in Afghanistan, as well as Northern Africa and our larger efforts to stop the spread of violent extremist groups and their ideology around the globe. Understanding the need for a holistic approach to national security, Adam recognizes the importance of poverty reduction, access to education, sustainable global markets, diplomatic engagement, good governance and other measures to enable our pursuit of stable international partners.  As such, he has been a long-time advocate of strengthening American diplomacy and development as well as defense. 
Congressman Smith sees a clear need to reform our foreign assistance and improve these two pillars of national security that have been under-resourced and underutilized for too long. He has supported efforts to reform American foreign assistance, introduced legislation to address global poverty, and created the bipartisan Congressional Caucus for Effective Foreign Assistance (CCEFA) with Congressman Ander Crenshaw. 
In 1993, Adam married Spokane native, Sara Bickle-Eldridge, a graduate of the University of Washington and Seattle University School of Law. Their daughter, Kendall Charlotte, was born in July 2000, followed by their son, Jack Evers, in June 2003. The Smiths live in Bellevue, where their children attend Cougar Ridge Elementary School and Issaquah Middle School, and participate in the local sports leagues. Both Adam and Sara are involved in various community organizations and Sara recently served two terms as PTA President at their children’s school.
