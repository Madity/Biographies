Elizabeth Stamatina "Tina" Fey (/ˈfeɪ/; born May 18, 1970)[2] is an American actress, comedian, writer and producer, known for her work on the NBC sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live (SNL, 1998–2006), the critically acclaimed NBC comedy series 30 Rock (2006–2013), and such films as Mean Girls (2004), Baby Mama (2008), Date Night (2010), Admission (2013), and Muppets Most Wanted (2014).
Fey first broke into comedy as a featured player in the Chicago-based improvisational comedy group The Second City. She then joined SNL as a writer, later becoming head writer and a performer, known for her position as co-anchor in the Weekend Update segment. In 2004, she co-starred in and wrote the screenplay for Mean Girls, which was partly adapted from a book. After leaving SNL in 2006, she created the television series 30 Rock, a situation comedy loosely based on her experiences at SNL. In the series, Fey portrays the head writer of a fictional sketch comedy series. In 2008, she starred in the comedy film Baby Mama, alongside former SNL co-star Amy Poehler. Fey next appeared alongside Steve Carell in the 2010 comedy film Date Night and with Will Ferrell in the animated film Megamind.
Fey has received eight Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, five Screen Actors Guild Awards, four Writers Guild of America Awards and has been nominated for a Grammy Award for her autobiographical book Bossypants, which topped the The New York Times Best Seller list for five weeks. In 2008, the Associated Press (AP) gave Fey the AP Entertainer of the Year award for her satirical portrayal of Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in a guest appearance on SNL.[3] In 2010, Fey was the recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, the youngest-ever winner of the award.[4] On January 13, 2013, Fey hosted the 70th Golden Globe Awards with her long-time friend and fellow comedian, Amy Poehler. Their performance was critically acclaimed.[5] The duo hosted again the following year to similar acclaim, generating the highest ratings for the annual ceremony in ten years.[6]
Fey was born in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania – a home rule township west of Philadelphia. Her mother, Jeanne (née Xenakes),[7][8] is a brokerage employee of Greek descent,[9] and her father, Donald Fey, is a university grant-proposal writer of half German and half Scottish descent.[7][10][11] She has a brother, Peter, who is eight years older.[7][12]
I remember my parents sneaking me in to see Young Frankenstein. We would also watch Saturday Night Live, or Monty Python, or old Marx Brothers movies. My dad would let us stay up late to watch The Honeymooners. We were not allowed to watch The Flintstones though: my dad hated it because it ripped off The Honeymooners.[13] I actually have a very low level of Flintstones knowledge for someone my age.[14]
Aged eleven, she read the 1981 Joe Franklin's Seventy Years of Great Film Comedians for a school project about comedy. She grew up watching Second City Television (SCTV), and has cited Catherine O'Hara as a role model.[15]
Fey attended Cardington-Stonehurst Elementary School and Beverly Hills Middle School in Upper Darby.[16] By middle school, she knew she was interested in comedy.[13] Fey attended Upper Darby High School, where she was an honor student,[17] a member of the choir, drama club, and tennis team, and co-editor of the school's newspaper, The Acorn.[17][18] She also anonymously wrote the newspaper's satirical column, The Colonel.[19] Following her graduation in 1988,[16][20] Fey enrolled at the University of Virginia, where she studied playwriting and acting.[21] She graduated in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in drama.[22]
While performing shows with The Second City in 1997, Fey submitted several scripts to NBC's variety show Saturday Night Live (SNL), at the request of its head writer Adam McKay, a former performer at Second City.[9] She was hired as a writer[23] for SNL following a meeting with SNL creator Lorne Michaels, and moved to New York.[24] Fey told The New Yorker, "I'd had my eye on the show forever, the way other kids have their eye on Derek Jeter."[9] Originally, Fey "struggled" at SNL.[24] Her first sketch to air starred Chris Farley in a Sally Jessy Raphael satire.[24] Fey went on to write a series of parodies, including one of ABC's morning talk show The View.[25] She co-wrote the "Sully and Denise" sketches with Rachel Dratch,[24] who plays one of the teens.[25]
Fey played an extra in one of the episodes in 1998,[26] and after watching herself, decided to diet[27] and lost 30 pounds. She told The New York Times, "I was a completely normal weight, but I was here in New York City, I had money and I couldn't buy any clothes. After I lost weight, there was interest in putting me on camera."[28] In 1999, McKay stepped down as head writer, which led Michaels to approach Fey for the position.[24] She became SNL's first female head writer that year[29]
In 2000, Fey began performing in sketches,[9] and she and Jimmy Fallon became co-anchors of SNL's Weekend Update segment.[29] Fey said she did not ask to audition, but that Michaels approached her.[27][30] Michaels explained that there was "chemistry" between Fey and Fallon.[30] Michaels, however, revealed that choosing Fey was "kind of risky" at the time.[31] Her role in Weekend Update was well received by critics. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: "...Fey delivers such blow darts – poison filled jokes written in long, precisely parsed sentences unprecedented in Update history – with such a bright, sunny countenance makes her all the more devilishly delightful."[32] Dennis Miller, a former cast member of SNL and anchor of Weekend Update, was pleased with Fey as one of the anchors for the segment: "...Fey might be the best Weekend Update anchor who ever did it. She writes the funniest jokes".[33] Robert Bianco of USA Today, however, commented that he was "not enamored" of the pairing.[34]
In 2001, Fey and the writing staff won a Writers Guild of America Award for SNL's 25th anniversary special.[9] The following year at the 2002 Emmy Awards ceremony, she and the writing team won the Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program.[35]
The pairing of Fey and Fallon ended in May 2004 when Fallon last appeared as a cast member.[36] He was replaced by Amy Poehler.[37] It was the first time that two women co-anchored Weekend Update.[38] Fey revealed that she "hired" Poehler as her co-host for the segment.[39] The reception to the teaming of Fey and Poehler was positive, with Rachel Sklar of the Chicago Tribune noting that the pairing "has been a hilarious, pitch-perfect success as they play-off each other with quick one-liners and deadpan delivery".[37]
The 2005–2006 season was her last; she thereafter departed to develop 30 Rock.[40] At the time she left, Fey had become the show's longest-serving Weekend Update anchor with a tenure of 117 episodes (a mark that would later be passed by her replacement, Seth Meyers).
In 2002, Fey suggested a pilot episode for a situation comedy about a cable news network to NBC, who rejected it. The pilot was reworked to revolve around an SNL style series, and was accepted by NBC.[42] She signed a contract with NBC in May 2003, which allowed her to remain in her SNL head writer position at least through the 2004–2005 television season. As part of the contract, Fey was to develop a prime-time project to be produced by Broadway Video and NBC Universal.[43] She began developing the pilot project under the working title Untitled Tina Fey Project.[44] The pilot, directed by Adam Bernstein,[45] centered on the head writer of a variety show and how she managed her relationships with the show's volatile star and its executive producer.[46] In October 2006, the pilot aired on NBC as 30 Rock. Although the episode received generally favorable reviews,[47] it finished third in its timeslot.[48]
The network renewed the series for a second season, which began in October 2007.[49] The show's third season premiered on October 30, 2008. The premiere episode set records for the highest ratings of the series.[50] In January 2009, NBC renewed 30 Rock for the 2009–2010 season.[51]
In 2007, Fey received an Emmy Award[52] nomination for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series.[53] The show itself won the 2007 Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series.[54] In 2008, she won the Golden Globe,[55] Screen Actors Guild,[56] and Emmy awards all in the category for Best Actress in a Comedy Series.[57] The following year, Fey again won the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award in the same categories,[55][58] and was nominated for an Emmy Award.[59] In early 2010, Fey received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress,[60] and won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Lead Actress.[61] 30 Rock was renewed for the 2010–2011 season in March 2010.[62] The series returned for the 2011–2012 season, though due to Fey's pregnancy with her second child, the season premiere was delayed until midseason.[63] Fey once mentioned that her performance on the show is inspired by Julia Louis-Dreyfus,[64] and later used Louis-Dreyfus to play the stand-in for the character of Liz Lemon in flashback scenes during the live episode of the fifth season. On May 11, 2012, it was announced that the show had been renewed for a seventh and final season, to premiere October 4, 2012, with only 13 episodes. After receiving 13 Emmy Award nominations and two wins for this final season, 30 Rock ended its critically acclaimed run with 112 Emmy award nominations. It has consistently been cited as one of the greatest series of all time[65] and it is considered to have one of the greatest finales in television history.[66][67][68]
In 2002, Fey appeared in the surreal comedy Martin & Orloff.[69] She made her debut as writer and co-star of the 2004 teen comedy Mean Girls. Characters and behaviors in the movie are based on Fey's high school life at Upper Darby High School[70] and on the non-fiction book Queen Bees and Wannabes by Rosalind Wiseman.[71] The cast includes other past cast members of SNL including Tim Meadows, Ana Gasteyer, and Amy Poehler. The film received favorable reviews,[72] and was a box office success, grossing US$129 million worldwide.[73]
In a 2004 interview, Fey expressed that she would like to write and direct movies in which she has small parts.[17] In 2006, Fey worked on a movie script for Paramount Pictures, which was to feature Sacha Baron Cohen, by the name of Curly Oxide and Vic Thrill, based loosely on the true story of a Hasidic rock musician.[74][75] In 2007, she was cast in the animated comedy film Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters as the Aqua Teens' mother, a giant burrito.[76]
She received her SAG Card after appearing in Artie Lange's Beer League released in 2006, in which she was compelled to join for "... a thousand dollars".[77]
Fey and former SNL castmate Amy Poehler starred in the 2008 comedy Baby Mama. The movie was written and directed by Michael McCullers. The plot concerns Kate (Fey), a business woman, who wants a child but, discovering she has only a million-to-one chance of getting pregnant, decides to find a surrogate: Angie (Poehler), a white-trash schemer.[78] Baby Mama received mixed reviews, but many critics enjoyed Fey's performance. Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote: "Fey is a delight to watch throughout. Able to convey Kate's intentions and feelings through the simple looks and inflections, she never melodramatizes her situation; nor does her efficient, perfectionist side become overbearing."[79] The movie grossed over US$64 million at the box office.[73]
Fey's projects after 2008 include her lending her voice to the character Lisa in the English-language version of the Japanese animated film Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea (titled Ponyo for its U.S. release).[80] In 2009, she appeared in The Invention of Lying,[81] alongside Ricky Gervais, Jennifer Garner, Rob Lowe, and Christopher Guest.[82] Her next film role was in Shawn Levy's 2010 comedy Date Night,[83] a feature that focuses on a married couple, played by Fey and Steve Carell, who go on a date; however, the night goes awry for the two.[84] Also in the same year, she voiced Roxanne Ritchie, a television reporter, in the DreamWorks animated film Megamind (2010).[85] With a total worldwide gross of US$321 million, Megamind is Fey's most commercially successful picture to date. It earned US$173 million outside the U.S. and US$148 million domestically.[73]
In January 2011, it was announced that Fey would star in the comedy/drama film entitled Admission based on the Jean Hanff Korelitz novel by the same name. The film was directed by Paul Weitz.[86]
From September to November 2008, Fey made frequent guest appearances on SNL to perform a series of parodies of Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. On the 34th season premiere episode, aired September 13, 2008, Fey imitated Palin in a sketch, alongside Amy Poehler as Hillary Clinton. Their repartee included Clinton needling Palin about her "Tina Fey glasses".[87] The sketch quickly became NBC's most-watched viral video ever, with 5.7 million views by the following Wednesday.[88] Fey reprised this role on the October 4 show,[89] on the October 18 show where she was joined by the real Sarah Palin, and on the November 1 show where she was joined by John McCain and his wife Cindy. The October 18 show had the best ratings of any SNL show since 1994.[90] The following year Fey won an Emmy in the category of Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her impersonation of Palin.[91] Fey returned to SNL in April 2010, and reprised her impression of Palin in one sketch titled the "Sarah Palin Network".[92] Fey once again did her impression of Palin when she hosted Saturday Night Live on May 8, 2011.[93]
In December 2009, Entertainment Weekly put her impersonation on its end-of-the-decade "best-of" list, writing, "Fey's freakishly spot-on SNL impersonation of the wannabe VP (and her ability to strike a balance between comedy and cruelty) made for truly transcendent television."[94]
In 1997, Fey and other members of The Second City provided voices for the pinball game Medieval Madness.
In 2000, Fey partnered with fellow SNL cast member Rachel Dratch in the Off Broadway two-woman show Dratch & Fey at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in New York City.[95][96] The production was well received by critics.[97] Tim Townsend of The Wall Street Journal in review of Dratch & Fey, wrote that the fun part of watching them perform was "seeing how comfortable they are with each other".[95] He concluded that the production "isn't about two women being funny. [...] Dratch and Fey are just funny. Period."[95] One of the SNL sketches, "Sully and Denise", originated at Second City in Chicago.[24]
On August 13, 2007, Fey made a guest appearance on the children's television series Sesame Street, in the episode, "The Bookaneers".[98] She appeared as a guest judge on the November 25, 2007, episode of the Food Network program Iron Chef America.[99] Fey has appeared in Disney's campaign "Year of a Million Dreams" as Tinker Bell, along with Mikhail Baryshnikov as Peter Pan and Gisele Bündchen as Wendy Darling.[100] She has also done commercials for American Express credit card in 2008, and Garnier Nutrisse hair color in 2012.[101][102][103]
On February 23, 2008, Fey hosted the first episode of SNL after the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike.[104] For this appearance, she was nominated for an Emmy in the category of Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.[105] Fey hosted SNL for a second time on April 10, 2010, and for her appearance she received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.[106]
On April 5, 2011, her book, a humorous autobiography entitled Bossypants, was released. It received a positive review from the New York Times.[107]
In 2011, Fey narrated The Secret Life of Girls, a two-hour-long radio documentary produced by The Kitchen Sisters. Fey introduced stories of women and girls from around the world, and also shared memories of her own girlhood and mother.[108]
In 2012, Fey made her rapping debut on Childish Gambino (Donald Glover's music stage name)'s mixtape named "Royalty". Glover is a former writer on 30 Rock, on which he worked with Fey. She was also featured in the iCarly episode "iShock America" as herself.
In 2002, Fey was ranked in the Hot 100 List at number 80 on Maxim magazine,[109] which used photos taken earlier by Rolling Stone calling her "the thinking man's sex symbol".[110] She was named one of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People in 2003,[111] and one of People magazine's 100 Most Beautiful People in 2007, 2008, and 2009.[112][113][114][115] In 2007, Fey placed seventh on the Hot 100 List on AfterEllen.com.[116] She repeated the appearance the following year, being voted as number one on the list.[117]
In 2001, Entertainment Weekly named Fey as one of their Entertainers of the Year for her work on Weekend Update.[118] In 2007, she was named one of the magazine's Entertainers of the Year,[119] and placed number two in 2008.[120] In 2009, Fey was named as Entertainment Weekly's fifth individual in their 15 Entertainers of the 2000s list.[121] In 2013, Entertainment Weekly crowned Fey as "The Once and Future Queen" (an allusion to The Once and Future King) in their feature on "Women Who Run TV," calling her "the funniest woman in the free world." EW quoted Mindy Kaling as saying, "I always feel unoriginal bringing up Tina as my inspiration, but she's everyone's inspiration for a reason." The column also quoted praise by Zooey Deschanel and Lena Dunham.[122]
The newspaper editors and broadcast producers of the Associated Press voted Fey the AP Entertainer of the Year as the performer who had the greatest impact on culture and entertainment in 2008, citing her impression of Sarah Palin on SNL.[3] She has appeared on Forbes' annual Celebrity 100 list of the 100 most powerful celebrities in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 at No. 99, No. 86, No. 90, No. 92, and No. 79 respectively.[123][124][125][126][127]
In 2007, the New York Post included Fey in New York's 50 Most Powerful Women, ranking her at number 33.[128] Fey was among the Time 100, a list of the 100 most influential people in the world, in 2007 and 2009, as selected annually by Time magazine.[129][130] Fey's featured article for the 2009 list was written by 30 Rock co-star, Alec Baldwin.[130] She was selected by Barbara Walters as one of America's 10 Most Fascinating People of 2008.[131]
In September 2011, Fey landed at the top of the Forbes magazine's list of the highest-paid TV actresses.[132]
In 1994, two years after she joined Chicago's Second City improvisational theatre troupe, she began dating Jeff Richmond, a piano player who later became Second City's musical director and then a composer on 30 Rock. They married in a Greek Orthodox ceremony on June 3, 2001.[2] The couple has two daughters: Alice Zenobia Richmond (born September 10, 2005)[134] and Penelope Athena Richmond (born August 10, 2011).[135][136] In April 2009, Fey and Richmond purchased a US$3.4 million apartment on the Upper West Side in New York City.[137]
Fey has a scar a few inches long on the left side of her chin and cheek, the cause of which remained unexplained to the public until a 2008 Vanity Fair profile by Maureen Dowd,[138] and subsequently in her autobiographical book, where she revealed "During the spring semester of kindergarten, I was slashed in the face by a stranger in the alley behind my house."[139]
Her charity work includes support of Autism Speaks, an organization that sponsors autism research.[140][141] In April 2008, she participated in Night of Too Many Stars, a comedy benefit show for autism education.[142]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Elizabeth Stamatina Fey was born in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, just west of Philadelphia, in 1970 to Donald and Jeannec Fey. Going by the name of Tina, Ms. Fey considered herself a "supernerd" during her high school and college years. She studied drama at the University of Virginia, and after graduating in 1992, she headed to Chicago, the ancestral home of American comedy. While working at a YMCA to support herself, she started Second City's first set of courses. After about nine months, a teacher told her to just skip ahead and audition for the more selective Second City Training Center. She failed but about eight weeks later, she re-auditioned and got into the year-long program. She ended up spending many years at The Second City in Chicago where many SNL cast members first started out. Then in 1995, Saturday Night Live (1975) came to The Second City's cast, including Fey's friend, Adam McKay, as a writer, searching for new talent. What they found was Tina Fey. When Adam was made Head writer, he suggested Fey should send a submission packet over the summer with six sketches, 10 pages each. Tina took the advice and sent them. After Lorne Michaels met her and saw her work she was offered a job a week later. She admitted that she was extremely nervous working in the legendary Studio 8H; being a foot shorter than everyone else, younger, and being one of the only female writers at the time. After a few years, Tina made history by becoming the first female head writer in the show's history. Tina also made her screen debut as a featured player during the 25th season by co-anchoring Weekend Update with Jimmy Fallon. Since Tina and Jimmy have taken over Weekend Update it has been considered the best ever. This year she made it to full fledged star by becoming a regular cast member, though she is hardly on the show, besides Update. And during the past two summers, Tina and Rachel Dratch performed their two-woman show to critical acclaim in both Chicago (1999) and New York (2000) and made their Aspen Comedy Festival Debut. Tina is married to Jeff Richmond, a Second City director and currently lives in New York City.
      Her husband, Jeff Richmond is a Second City director. That's how they met. He is ten years older than she is.
      As a head writer for Saturday Night Live (1975) she has written the Old French Whore, The View, Sully and Denise and the Monica Lewinsky skits, among many, many others.
      In her first session as a member of the Saturday Night Live (1975) writing staff, the 5'4" Tina found discovered that she was a foot shorter than the mostly male writing staff, and felt for a while as if she'd shrunk.
      Recorded the voices for the British and German princesses for Williams' "Medieval Madness" pinball machine.
      She is an alumna of the Famous Improv Olympic, along with actors Vince Vaughn, the late Chris Farley, Ossie Beck, Mike Myers, Amy Poehler, and Adam McKay.
      Is often compared to Nana Mouskouri, to whom she bears a striking resemblance. This may be due to both women's common Greek ancestry and the fact that they both have black-rimmed glasses as their trademark.
      Born in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, the same town in which Saturday Night Live (1975) alumna Cheri Oteri (a cast member when Fey was writing on SNL) grew up.
      In June 2008, rated the hottest woman for 2008, after having improved from last years 7th place according to Afterellen.com's "2008 Hot 100 List", a compilation of 100 Hot women voted in by the LGBTQ community.
      Her hometown, Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, is also where Todd Rundgren grew up. They both had the same algebra teacher, although 20 years apart.
      Regarding the scar on Fey's left cheek, in an interview in Vanity Fair, husband Jeff Richmond says a stranger slashed Fey's face when she was five years old. He says the incident occurred in the front yard of her house.
      Is a big fan of Star Wars movies and often uses references to the movies in her roles and writing.
      Revealed in an interview that she did not lose her virginity until she was 24 years old. She also revealed that she was a virgin when she met her husband, and that he is the only man she has ever been intimate with.
      Recipient of the 2010 Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, given annually by the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
      Is semi-fluent in German. She says about herself that she speaks "less than first-grade" German.
      Returned to work one month after giving birth to her daughter Alice in order to resume filming Saturday Night Live (1975).
      Was 4 months pregnant with her daughter Penelope when she took maternity leave from filming 30 Rock (2006).
      Returned to work 2 months after giving birth to her daughter Penelope to resume filming 30 Rock (2006).
      Wrote a remake of Bye Bye Birdie (1963) that was to be directed by Jon M. Chu. But the project was canceled due to budget concerns.
      Gave birth to her 1st child at age 35, a daughter Alice Zenobia Richmond on September 10, 2005. Child's father is her husband, Jeff Richmond.
      Gave birth to her 2nd child at age 41, a daughter Penelope Athena Richmond on August 10, 2011. Child's father is her husband, Jeff Richmond.
      The cover story of New York Magazine this week is "Baby Panic".  This goes perfectly with the other magazines on my coffee table - "Where Are The Babies?" (US), "Why Haven't You Had A Baby?" (People) and "For God's Sake Have A Baby" (Time). Thanks, Time magazine, this is just what I need - another article so depressing that I can actually hear my ovaries curling up.
      Prostitutes in Lyons, France, sent a fax to the government to complain that they are losing business to Eastern European women who are protected by the Albanian mafia. Okay, first of all, how rough-looking are these French prostitutes that all their customers are running to the Albanians? Secondly, why did they send a fax, and from whence? Do they have a fax machine in the whorehouse, or did they all trundle down to Kinko's - "You fax these, I'll let you shave me." Thirdly, how come French whores know how to work a fax machine, but every time I try to use it, I hit Powersave, or I forget to dial 9? This just proves what my boyfriend always says - that I am dumber than a French whore.
      [on her six-week maternity leave] I had to get back to work . . . NBC has me under contract; the baby and I only have a verbal agreement.
      [on Matthew McConaughey] He was always taking his shirt off, he's like "Yeah, here's my deal, I'm hot." We had a meeting one day at like 11 o'clock, right before the show and he walks into the meeting shirtless wearing this like old musty sarong . . . He doesn't smell great, no.
      [on Paris Hilton] She's a piece of shit. The people at [Saturday Night Live (1975)] were like, "Maybe she'll be fun, maybe she won't take herself so seriously". She takes herself so seriously! She's unbelievably dumb and so proud of how dumb she is. She looks like a tranny up close . . . Also, you would walk down the hall and find what just looked like nasty wads of Barbie hair on the stairs . . . Her hair is like a Fraggle.
      [on the idea of future Sarah Palin skits on Saturday Night Live (1975)] I want to be done playing this lady Nov. 5. So, if anybody can help me be done playing this lady Nov. 5, that would be good for me.
      [on her resemblance to Sarah Palin] I was resistant to acknowledge there was a resemblance. But my kid saw her and said, "That's Mommy", so I thought, "Oh, great".
      Mary Tyler Moore was a working woman whose story lines were not always about dating and men. They were about work friendships and relationships, which is what I feel my adult life has mostly been about.
      On first drawing up 30 Rock (2006): We wanted to make sure that everything we did with Liz Lemon rang true on some level - to me or to one of the other women in the room. And we did kind of know we were going into her as . . . well, as the opposite of a Sex and the City (1998) character. She's not about wish fulfillment or fantasy. I personally am a big fan of SATC - but it's pretty and it's fun to watch, like candy. One is a fairy tale, and the other is a grim fairy tale. I do really enjoy Sex and the City (1998) in spite of what I just said. I think I identify with Miranda. The redhead lawyer. I enjoyed her story lines most.
      I had a great time doing [Sarah Palin] but it was one of the strangest things that's ever happened to me. You can grow up thinking, 'I want to be on Saturday Night Live (1975) one day' or 'I want to be in a movie some day', but you never think, 'I hope there's a politician who looks just like me.' So much of everything I've ever done has come out of hard work and just hanging in there, being the last one standing at the bar - and then to have that fall in my lap was just crazy. Having done plays in Chicago for two actors and then all of a sudden people are just saying, 'Yes! Put the outfit on! You can say whatever you want!'
      I studied the usual acting methods at college - Stanislavsky and whatnot but none of it really clicked for me. At The Second City, I learnt that your focus should be entirely on your partner. Suddenly it all made sense.
      Stepping into the Saturday Night Live (1975) studio for the first time was momentous. The only equivalent would be doing The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992) - stepping into the show that I grew up watching. And it has a live audience. Even with a taped audience, you can get them jacked up and they know it's their job to pretend they like it. But especially in New York, that live audience is a real proving ground.
      I think there's a huge overlap in the middle, where funny is just funny - everyone gets it and laughs at that. But then I think there are certain kinds of jokes that women prefer and certain kinds that men prefer. Like, men will gravitate towards screaming and bears fighting robots. On the female side, if left alone, we will drift towards more and more character detail and minutiae. The tiniest behaviour will amuse us.
      I am obsessed with things like strippers and Playboy Playmates. I'm obsessed with portraying that as how grim I think it is. My friend Stephnie Weir did the best version of a sketch that I was always figuring out how to do. She did it perfectly, playing a stripper at a bachelor party who had to bring her kid because the babysitter fell through. The discomfort of that really makes me laugh.
      A portion of 30 Rock (2006) is autobiographical. Our world is a little more bent, but the relationships reflect the kind of over familiarity and competitiveness mixed with friendship mixed with contempt. It's a very, um, specific kind of workplace. The one thing about our show was that we could never portray writers as heroic. They're the least heroic, most cowardly, lazy group of people you could spend time with.
30 Rock (2006)'s fast-talking style comes from the fact that our show needs to be two and a half minutes longer than it is - I'm trying to fit five pounds' worth of ideas into a two-pound bag".
      I work, and then whenever I have any other time, I'm with my daughter, and then I go to sleep. I think you basically have to abandon the dreams of having any other adult activities in your life. You have to go to sleep whenever your child goes to sleep. That's basically how we're doing it.
      I try to keep learning, but I do think there is some . . . If you ask someone else, they would probably tell you there is something to do with gender and telling the truth about women. At least, as truthfully as I can see it. To let them be flawed in the way they are flawed. I don't know. I like to write about women, not so much about the way they relate to men, but about the way they relate to each other. And I don't think anyone's really doing it.
      [on wearing a Princess Leia costume for a Saturday Night Live (1975) sketch] You put that costume and that wig on and nerds go bananas. People were just staring at me in the hall, all these extras and background people and nerds wanted to talk to me all of a sudden. Guys have a real weird thing for that outfit.
      [on Paris Hilton on Saturday Night Live (1975)] She just wanted to make fun of all the girls she hates. She was like, Jessica Simpson, I hate her.' She would come in the room and say, 'You should do a show about 'Jessica Simpson' because she's fat.'
      Mrs. Palin is an inspiration to working mothers everywhere because she bailed on her job right before Fourth of July weekend. You are living my dream. Thank you, Mrs. Palin! [2009 Emmy acceptance speech.]
      [on performing in Improv]: You have to be resilient in that world. You have to fight your way in and hopefully you are playing with good players and their give and take is good and they will let you in. I always liken it to basketball. If you get passed to once in a game, you have to learn to make that basket or you don't get passed to again.
      I'm not that good looking... nobody is that good looking. I have seen a lot of movie stars and maybe four are amazing looking. The rest have a team of gay guys who make it happen.
      [on getting her first period at 10] I knew from commercials that one's menstrual period was a blue liquid that you poured like laundry detergent onto maxi-pads to test their absorbency. This wasn't blue, so I ignored it for a few hours.
      Lie and say 'Yes! I lost all my baby weight! Can you believe it?!' And people will be like 'Good for you!' and they won't really look.
      [to Anne Hathaway at the 2013 Golden Globes presentation] You gave a stunning performance in 'Les Miserables'. I have not seen someone so totally alone and abandoned like that since you were onstage with James Franco at the Oscars.
=======================================================
1990sTina's Turn in the Windy CityAfter earning her drama degree from the University of Virginia, Fey moves to Chicago, where she joins Chicago's legendary comedy troupe Second City (right) in 1994. She becomes friends with future Saturday Night Live alums Rachel Dratch and Horatio Sanz and meets Jeff Richmond, a director for Second City, whom she begins dating. "I was so happy," she tells CosmoGIRL! in 2008. "I was doing comedy with the best people in the field."1997AugustLive From New York...After sending sample sketches to SNL's producer Lorne Michaels, Fey joins the series as a staff writer. By 1999, she becomes the first female head writer on the show. "The skill you need for it is not necessarily to be the funniest person in that group," she tells Parade of her groundbreaking position. "What you need to be is a kind of conduit between the producers and the writers." A year later, she joins Jimmy Fallon as co-anchor of "Weekend Update."2001June 03Fey Marries RichmondAfter seven years of dating, Fey and Jeff Richmond marry in a Greek Orthodox ceremony. "I fell in love with her very quickly," Richmond, who is 10 years Fey's senior, tells PEOPLE. "She has this caustic, biting wit that pops out occasionally, but she really does have a little-girl-from-the-suburbs kind of ambience."2004Fey's Mean Girls HitAfter writing a film script based on Rosalind Wiseman's book Queen Bees and Wannabes, Fey makes her first movie pitch to Lorne Michaels, who agrees to help produce Mean Girls. The film, which stars Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams, is a hit. "I was cowardly mean," Fey admits to EW of her days in high school. "I would be home with my friends, just endlessly talking about whoever left the room." 2005September 10Baby MamaFey welcomes daughter Alice Zenobia Richmond and takes a 43-day maternity leave from SNL. "I had to get back to work," she tells Parade. "NBC has me under contract; the baby and I only have a verbal agreement." That same year, New York Magazine reports that Fey makes an impressive $1.5 million for performing and writing on SNL. 2006SNL: Sitcom VersionFey quits SNL to write, produce and star in her own TV show – a sitcom about a comedy sketch show. She watches a lot of The Mary Tyler Moore Show to inspire her writing, and tells EW that the idea for the show is to make it relatable to "anyone who works in an office."  That fall, 30 Rock airs on NBC, with Fey and Alec Baldwin in the lead roles.2007September 1630 Rocks the Emmys30 Rock, which is fledging in the ratings, is nominated for 10 Emmys. It takes home the prize for Outstanding Comedy. In her acceptance speech, Fey thanks the show's "dozens and dozens of viewers." NovemberFace of Writers' StrikeThe Writers Guild of America goes on strike, and Fey joins the picketing writers. Although Fey is contractually obligated to continue acting on 30 Rock, she says, "My staff and I are wholeheartedly supporting the strike...I hope they realize we're quite serious. I think they need to know we're very united." After 100 days on the picket lines, members of the WGA accept a deal with producers in February. 2008SpringBaby Mama Tops Box OfficeFey, who appears on the covers of Vanity Fair and Marie Claire, and longtime pal Amy Poehler star in Baby Mama. The comedy, about a businesswoman (Fey) who uses a surrogate (Poehler) to have her baby, opens at No. 1 and grosses $17.4 million in its opening weekend. September 13Tina 'Can See Russia' As PalinFey returns to SNL as Republican VP candidate Sarah Palin. As Palin, Fey famously says, "I can see Russia from my house." The New York Times says Fey's "winking, girlish, folksy impersonation of Ms. Palin has been called one of the most pitch-perfect in political satire." Her multiple appearances through the campaign season raise her profile and increase ratings for 30 Rock.

Birth Name: Elizabeth Stamatina FeyBirth Place: Upper Darby, PADate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 05/18/1970, TaurusProfession: Actor; writer; comedian; producer
Not only did Tina Fey make history when she became the first-ever female head writer for Saturday Night Live in 1999, she also helped revive the floundering sketch-comedy series. The self-declared übernerd wouldn't be seen on screen until 2000, when she began coanchoring Weekend Update, bringing to the faux news desk a sexy smirk, snappy comic timing and an intellectual wit. Fey was instrumental in bringing several funnywomen to the show, including Amy Poehler and Rachel Dratch. In 2004, she made her screenwriting and movie-acting debut with Mean Girls. The next year, she took a break to give birth to a daughter, but six weeks later she was back deadpanning one-liners on late-night TV. Beginning in 2006, she served as creator, writer and star of her own series, 30 Rock, a behind-the-scenes comedy about an SNL-type show. Although her prime-time duties prompted her to leave SNL behind, Fey found monumental success with the critically acclaimed 30 Rock, which earned no less than five Emmy Awards in its first three years. Fey herself became an award darling, scoring Emmy, Golden Globe, People's Choice and Screen Actors Guild prizes for her role as exasperated TV head writer Liz Lemon. She made a triumphant return to her SNL roots in 2008 to portray then-Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin in a series of guest-star turns. The wickedly on-target impersonation ("I can see Russia from my house") earned her yet another Emmy.Tina Fey Fast Facts:
Grew up in the Philadelphia suburbs. Moved to Chicago after college at the University of Virginia and studied at the Second City Training Center and ImprovOlympics. 
Frequently collaborates with fellow Second City alum Rachel Dratch; teamed with Dratch for a sketch-comedy show Dratch & Fey in Chicago and NY. 
Became first female head writer of Saturday Night Live in 1999 and became Weekend Update co-anchor with Jimmy Fallon in 2000. In 2004, Amy Poehler took over as Update co-anchor upon Fallon's departure from SNL. 
Named one of Entertainment Weekly's Entertainers of the Year in 2001 and one of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People of 2003. 
Impersonated then-vice presidental nominee Sarah Palin in recurring guest turns on Saturday Night Live, earning an Emmy for her on-target portrayal of the politician.Tina Fey Relationships: Donald Fey - FatherJeanne Fey - MotherAlice Richmond - DaughterJeff Richmond - HusbandPeter Fey - BrotherPenelope Athena Richmond - DaughterTina Fey Awards: 2010 Screen Actors Guild Awards:  Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series - Nominee2007 Emmy:  Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series - Nominee2011 Emmy:  Outstanding Comedy Series - Nominee2013 Emmy:  Outstanding Special Class Program - Nominee2007 Screen Actors Guild Awards:  Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series - Winner2013 Emmy:  Outstanding Comedy Series - Nominee2007 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series - Nominee2013 Emmy:  Outstanding Special Class - Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Programs - Nominee2012 Emmy:  Outstanding Comedy Series - Nominee2012 Screen Actors Guild Awards:  Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series - Nominee2013 Emmy:  Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics - Nominee2008 Emmy:  Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series - Winner2009 Golden Globe:  Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy - Winner2008 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series - Winner2007 Screen Actors Guild Awards:  Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series - Nominee2013 Emmy:  Outstanding Special Class - Short-Format Nonfiction Programs - Nominee2013 Screen Actors Guild Awards:  Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series - Nominee2009 Screen Actors Guild Awards:  Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series - Nominee2009 People's Choice Awards:  Favorite Funny Female Star - Winner2010 Screen Actors Guild Awards:  Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series - Nominee2012 Golden Globe:  Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Comedy or Musical - Nominee2003 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program - Nominee2010 Golden Globe:  Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy - Nominee2010 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series - Nominee2008 Screen Actors Guild Awards:  Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series - Winner2010 Emmy:  Outstanding Comedy Series - Nominee2011 Emmy:  Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series - Nominee2011 Screen Actors Guild Awards:  Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series - Nominee2013 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series - Winner2009 Emmy:  Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series - Nominee2002 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program - Winner2011 Emmy:  Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series - Nominee2001 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program - Nominee2011 Screen Actors Guild Awards:  Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series - Nominee2007 Emmy:  Outstanding Comedy Series - Winner2012 Screen Actors Guild Awards:  Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series - Winner2013 Golden Globe:  Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Comedy or Musical - Nominee2008 Screen Actors Guild Awards:  Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series - Winner2009 Screen Actors Guild Awards:  Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series - Winner2010 Emmy:  Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series - Nominee2008 Golden Globe:  Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy - Winner2008 Emmy:  Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program - Nominee2008 Emmy:  Outstanding Comedy Series - Winner2013 Emmy:  Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series - Nominee2013 Screen Actors Guild Awards:  Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series - Nominee2013 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special - Nominee2009 Emmy:  Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series - Winner2009 Emmy:  Outstanding Comedy Series - Winner2010 Emmy:  Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series - Nominee2011 Golden Globe:  Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Comedy or Musical - Nominee2012 Emmy:  Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series - Nominee2012 Emmy:  Outstanding Special Class - Short-Format Nonfiction Programs - NomineeCollege: University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA (BA in Drama, 1992)

As Saturday Night Live's first-ever female head writer, quick-witted comedian Tina Fey not only shattered the glass ceiling at SNL, but also succeeded in proving that she is one of the most talented comedy writers in the entertainment industry. The Upper Darby, PA, native quickly made her way to Chicago's famed Second City after finishing drama studies at the University of Virginia in 1992, maintaining her livelihood with a job at the local YMCA and rapidly excelling through Second City's exhausting course load. Advised by her instructor to skip forward to the more selective Second City Training Center, Fey took him up on his advice and, though rejected at first, she was eventually accepted into the fold. When Saturday Night Live came to Second City seeking some fresh new talent in 1995, Fey and friend Adam McKay stood out from the pack. It was McKay's prompting that eventually found Fey hired as a writer for the enduring sketch comedy series. In addition to opening the door for her entrance into SNL, her tenure at Second City also found Fey making the acquaintance of future husband Jeff Richmond, who served as director for the Chicago comedy troupe. After joining the cast as a staff writer in 1997, Fey soon made history as SNL's first female writing supervisor two short years later. She was Emmy-nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program three years in a row from 2001-2003, and her mark both behind the scenes and as one-half of the Weekend Update crew (opposite SNL favorite Jimmy Fallon) was unmistakable. When Fallon left SNL in 2004, Amy Poehler took over his position at the news desk, making her and Fey the first two-woman news team in Weekend Update history. In the midst of her hectic schedule at Studio 8H, Fey somehow found time to perform the critically praised two-woman comedy show Dratch and Fey in both Chicago (1999) and New York (2000). Fey's other work has included writing for such programs as the confrontational comedy series The Colin Quinn Show, shown on pay-cable mainstay Comedy Central. If fans had wondered when -- as all high-profile SNL cast members eventually do -- Fey would set her sights on feature films, their curiosity would soon be answered when it was announced that Fey would be writing and appearing in Mean Girls (2004), an adaptation of author Rosalind Wiseman's popular book Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence. The film's combination of high-school realism and smart humor made it a hit with teens and adults alike.  As the 2004-2005 season of SNL drew to a close, Fey announced that she wouldn't be returning for the next season, but fans of the writer and comedian didn't stray too far. She would leave the show only to become a bigger star in her own right, creating, writing, and starring in the NBC comedy series 30 Rock, which she both wrote and starred in as the head writer for a popular sketch comedy series. Additionally, Fey would cement her role as the queen of comedy with roles in feature films like Baby Mama and Date Night. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi
