Hannah Arendt was born on October 14, 1906, in Hanover, Wilhelmine, Germany. Raised in Konigsberg, she was the only child of Paul and Martha (Cohn) Arendt, both prodigy of entrepreneurs from Russian-Jewish families. When she was seven, her father died of paresis (syphilitic insanity). Her mother married Martin Beerwald in 1920, bringing two older stepsisters, Eva and Clara Beerwald, into Hannah Arendt's home.
Arendt was an avid reader from a young age, and by her sixteenth year her literary interests included Kant, and Goethe. In 1924 she graduated from high school in Koenigsberg. Perhaps inspired by the theology and romantic thought of Kierkegaard's poetry that was also in her library, she decided to study theology at the University of Marburg with Rudolf Bultmann. Martin Heidegger was lecturing at Marburg on Existenzphilosophie, and writing what would eventually become Sein und Zeit [Being and time] in 1927. It was during her time at Marburg that Arendt began her long relationship with Heidegger, sparked by a brief and passionate affair. The affair ended when Arendt learned of Heidegger's involvement in the National Socialist party, but the friendship, however strained, would continue for years to come, and Heidegger's phenomenological method had a notable influence on Arendt's work.
Arendt went on to study the phenomenological method with Husserl, then became a student at the University of Heidelberg, studying with the existentialist Karl Jaspers. It is under Jaspers that she wrote her dissertation on St. Augustine's concept of Love (Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin). Jaspers and Arendt maintained a close relationship throughout their lives.
Arendt's unique approach to political thought is derived from her education in and fidelity to the phenomenological method. Unlike typical political writing or philosophy which might begin with an analysis of general political concepts or empirical data associated with political science and impose conceptual structures on experience after the fact, she begins by prioritizing human life in its 'factical' and experiential character. By using the phenomenological method, returning to 'the things themselves', she attempts to reveal the fundamental structures of political experience, or political being-in-the-world, in its distinct existence apart from other ways of being.
In September 1929 Arendt earned her doctorate, and married Günther Stern (whose nom-de-plume was Günter Anders). Anti-Semitism was on the rise in Germany, and Arendt undertook a project that would help her understand the conflict between German Nationalism and minority status. The book Rahel Varnhagen: The Life of a Jewish Woman was a biography of a Jewish salon hostess in Berlin in the early 1800s who converted to Christianity. It remained unpublished until 1958.
In 1933, with National Socialism on the rise, Arendt increased her political activity. In association with the German Zionist Organization lead by Kurt Blimenfeld, she assisted the publication of information regarding victims of Nazism. She was arrested by the Gestapo for conducting research on anti-Semitic propaganda, but managed to escape her prison sentence and fled to Paris. In Paris she gained the friendship of Walter Benjamin and Raymond Aron, and continued her political activism through work with Youth Aliyah moving Jewish children from Germany to Palestine.
In 1939 Arendt divorced her first husband and remarried the following year to Heinrich Blücher who she had met in 1936. Blücher, a political refugee from Germany, was a communist, and had been a member of the Spartacus League run by Rosa Luxemburg. Only six months into their marriage in 1940 the couple was separately interned in Southern France, the fate of many other stateless Germans when the Wehrmacht invaded. Arendt managed to escape from Gurs where she was interned, she reunited with Blücher, and in May 1941 found safe passage to neutral America. During the rest of World War II, Arendt lived in New York, and worked on what would eventually be published as The Origins of Totalitarianism. This text was finally published in 1951, the same year she became a citizen of the United States. The Origins of Totalitarianism was received enthusiastically, and made Arendt an intellectual celebrity. It was reprinted as an expanded edition in 1958, having taken into account the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.
In New York Arendt worked in two main intellectual circles. Her writing appeared early on in the journal Jewish Social Studies, and she became friends with the editor and his wife, Salo and Jeannette Baron. She wrote arguments for a Jewish army in other magazines like Jewish Frontier and Aufbau [Reconstruction]. She worked as an editor at Schocken Books, a German Jewish publishing firm that had been reestablished in New York and Palestine. Baron charged Arendt with the task of redistributing Judaic artifacts and salvaged treasures for the Jewish Cultural Reconstruction. Her other intellectual circle of activity included Dwight Macdonald and Mary McCarthy, and was associated with the Partisan Review. In this circle she met the critic Alfred Kazin who aided her with her writing of The Origins of Totalitarianism.
In 1952 Arendt received a Guggenheim Foundation Grant for the study of Marxism and totalitarianism. Her next three books came from this work: The Human Condition (1958); Between Past and Future (1961); and On Revolution (1968). In these texts we can read her desire to reconstruct political philosophy in phenomenological terms. The controversial text Reflections on Little Rock (1959) studied the emerging Black civil rights movement. She wrote articles for the New York Review of Books in the 1960s and early 1970s criticizing the abuse of executive power and what she calls the "imperial presidency" associated with military intervention in Vietnam. She became the first woman to hold a full professorship at Princeton University and she went on the teach at the University of Chicago, Wesleyan University, and the New School for Social Research in New York.
Arendt published the most controversial work of her career in 1963 with Eichmann in Jerusalem. Arendt covered Eichmann's trial in Isreal as a correspondent for The New Yorker in 1960, when Isreali security forces had captured the S.S. lieutenant colonel responsible for the transportation of Jews to death camps. Eichmann in Jerusalem is the collection of revised articles from her coverage of the trial. According to her text, Eichmann had not had a sadistic will to do evil, but had been thoughtless; he had failed to think about what he was doing. Her concept of the banality of evil caused considerable friction between herself and the organized Jewish community, as her book was read by some as an elevation of Eichmann's character and a questioning of Jewish innocence. Arendt was concerned that the ability to act according to conscience and rational thought was becoming obscured by partisanship and nationalism, combined with modernization. Most of her writing studies the sense of a shared world and the possibilities of freedom grounded therein.
Arendt's writing on the Eichmann trials lead to a series of lectures on judgement, the neo-Kantian meditation which were part of the work for The Life of the Mind (1978). While in Aberdeen, Scotland, delivering these Gifford Lectures, she survived a heart attack. The second and fatal attack occurred while entertaining the Barons in her New York apartment on December 4, 1975. The first two volumes of The Life of the Mind were published posthumously, Volume 1 Thinking and Volume 2 Willing, as her death cut short her work on the third volume, Judging.
Arendt's life became the inspiration for the novel An Admirable Woman (1983) by Arthur A. Cohen, possibly because her personal struggles and romantic life were so intriguing. Her romantic interests included Leo Strauss, Hans J. Morgenthau, and W.H. Auden. During her life she fiercely guarded her privacy, tending to resist doing interviews or appearing on television. Although she was one of the United States' most prominent intellectuals, she refused the Anglo-American philosophical tendencies of pragmatism, empiricism, and liberalism. Her texts have had an enormous impact on political theory, and many conferences, books and anthologies continue to celebrate her work. In 1975 Hannah Arendt was awarded the Sonning Prize by the Danish government for Contributions to European Civilization, an award that has never before been received by an American or a woman.

Johanna "Hannah" Arendt[2](/ˈɛərənt/ or /ˈɑrənt/; German: [ˈaːʀənt]; 14 October 1906 – 4 December 1975) was a German-American political theorist. Though often described as a philosopher, she rejected that label on the grounds that philosophy is concerned with "man in the singular" and instead described herself as a political theorist because her work centers on the fact that "men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world."[3] Her works deal with the nature of power, and the subjects of politics, direct democracy, authority, and totalitarianism. The Hannah Arendt Prize is named in her honor.
Arendt was born into a secular family of German Jews in Linden (present-day Hanover), the daughter of Martha (née Cohn) and Paul Arendt.[4] She grew up in Königsberg (renamed Kaliningrad and annexed to the Soviet Union in 1946) and Berlin. At the University of Marburg, she studied philosophy with Martin Heidegger.
According to Hans Jonas, her only German-Jewish classmate, Arendt embarked on a long and stormy romantic relationship with Heidegger, for which she later was criticized due to Heidegger's support for the Nazi Party when he was rector at the University of Freiburg.
In the wake of one of their breakups, Arendt moved to Heidelberg, where she wrote her dissertation under the existentialist philosopher-psychologist Karl Jaspers on the concept of love in the thought of Saint Augustine. In 1929, in Berlin, she married Günther Stern, later known as Günther Anders; they divorced in 1937. The dissertation was published in 1929. Although an agnostic,[5] Arendt was prevented from "habilitating"—a prerequisite for teaching in German universities—because she was Jewish. She researched anti-Semitism for some time before being interrogated[when?] by the Gestapo.
In 1933, Arendt fled Germany for Paris, where she befriended the Marxist literary critic and philosopher, Walter Benjamin, her first husband's cousin. While in France, she worked to support and aid Jewish refugees. In 1937, she was stripped of her German citizenship. In 1940, she married the German poet and Marxist philosopher Heinrich Blücher, a former member of the Communist Party. Later that year, after the German military occupation of northern France, the Vichy regime began deportation of Jews to Nazi concentration camps in the unoccupied south of France, and she was interned in Camp Gurs as an "enemy alien".
Arendt was able to escape after a few weeks and left France in 1941 with her husband and her mother to the United States. They relied on visas illegally issued by the American diplomat Hiram Bingham, who aided roughly 2,500 Jewish refugees in this way. Varian Fry, another American humanitarian, paid for their travel and helped obtain the visas. Upon arriving in New York, Arendt became active in the German-Jewish community. From 1941–45, she wrote a column for the German-language Jewish newspaper, Aufbau. From 1944, she directed research for the Commission of European Jewish Cultural Reconstruction and traveled frequently to Germany in this capacity.[6]
After World War II, she returned to Germany and worked for Youth Aliyah, a Zionist organization, which saved thousands of children from the Holocaust and settled them in the British Mandate of Palestine.[7] She became a close friend of Karl Jaspers and his wife, developing a deep intellectual friendship with him.[8] She began corresponding with American author Mary McCarthy around this time.[9]
In 1950, Arendt became a naturalized citizen of the United States.[10] She served as a visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, Princeton University, and Northwestern University. In 1959, she was named the first female lecturer at Princeton. She also taught at the University of Chicago from 1963 to 1967, where she was a member of the Committee on Social Thought; The New School in Manhattan; Yale University, where she was a fellow; and, the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University (1961–62, 1962–63).[11]
She was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1962 and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1964.[12][13]
Arendt was instrumental in the creation in 1974 of Structured Liberal Education (SLE) at Stanford University. She wrote a letter to the then president of Stanford University to persuade the university to enact Mark Mancall's vision of a residentially-based humanities program.[14]
Arendt died in New York City on 4 December 1975, at age 69, of a heart attack. She was buried at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York.
Arendt's first major book was titled The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), which traced the roots of Stalinist Communism and Nazism in both anti-Semitism and imperialism. The book was opposed by the Left on the grounds that it presented the two movements as equally tyrannical. She further contends that Jewry was not the operative factor in the Holocaust, but merely a convenient proxy. Totalitarianism in Germany was, in the end, about megalomania and consistency, not eradicating Jews.
Arguably her most influential work, The Human Condition (1958) distinguishes between the concepts of political and social, labor and work, various forms of action, and explores implications of those distinctions. Her theory of political action, corresponding to the existence of a public realm, is extensively developed in this work. Arendt argues that, while human life always evolves within societies, the social-being part of human nature, political life, was intentionally constructed by only a few of these societies as a space for individuals to achieve freedom through the construction of a common world. These categories, which attempt to bridge the gap between ontological and sociological structures, are sharply delineated. While Arendt relegates labor and work to the realm of the "social", she favors the human condition of action as the "political" that is both existential and aesthetic.[15]
Her collection of essays, Men in Dark Times, presents intellectual biographies of some creative and moral figures of the twentieth century, such as Walter Benjamin, Karl Jaspers, Rosa Luxemburg, Hermann Broch, Pope John XXIII, and Isak Dinesen.
In her reporting of the 1961 Adolf Eichmann trial for The New Yorker, which evolved into Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil (1963), she coined the phrase "the banality of evil" to describe the phenomenon of Eichmann. She raised the question of whether evil is radical or simply a function of thoughtlessness, a tendency of ordinary people to obey orders and conform to mass opinion without a critical evaluation of the consequences of their actions and inaction. She was sharply critical of the way the trial was conducted in Israel. She also was critical of the way that some Jewish leaders, notably M. C. Rumkowski, acted during the Holocaust. This caused a considerable controversy and even animosity toward Arendt in the Jewish community. Her friend Gershom Scholem, a major scholar of Jewish mysticism, broke off relations with her. Arendt was criticized by many Jewish public figures, who charged her with coldness and lack of sympathy for the victims of the Holocaust.
Due to this lingering criticism, her book has only recently been translated into Hebrew. Arendt ended the book by writing:
Just as you [Eichmann] supported and carried out a policy of not wanting to share the earth with the Jewish people and the people of a number of other nations—as though you and your superiors had any right to determine who should and who should not inhabit the world—we find that no one, that is, no member of the human race, can be expected to want to share the earth with you. This is the reason, and the only reason, you must hang.
Arendt presents a comparison of two of the main revolutions of the eighteenth century, the American and French Revolutions. She goes against a common view of both Marxist and leftist views when she argues that France, while well studied and often emulated, was a disaster and that the largely ignored American Revolution was a success. The turning point in the French Revolution occurred when the leaders rejected their goals of freedom in order to focus on compassion for the masses. In America, the Founding Fathers never betray the goal of Constitutio Libertatis. However, Arendt believes the revolutionary spirit of those men has been lost, and advocates a “council system” as an appropriate institution to regain that spirit.
Arendt's essay, "On Violence", distinguishes between violence and power. She maintains that, although theorists of both the Left and Right regard violence as an extreme manifestation of power, the two concepts are, in fact, antithetical. Power comes from the collective will and does not need violence to achieve any of its goals, since voluntary compliance takes its place. As governments start losing their legitimacy, violence becomes an artificial means toward the same end and is therefore, found only in the absence of power. Bureaucracies then become the ideal birthplaces of violence since they are defined as the "rule by no one" against whom to argue and therefore, recreate the missing links with the people they rule over.
Her posthumous book, The Life of the Mind (1978, edited by Mary McCarthy), remained incomplete. Stemming from her Gifford Lectures at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, it focuses on the mental faculties of thinking and willing, in a sense moving beyond her previous work concerning the vita activa. In her discussion of thinking, she focuses mainly on Socrates and his notion of thinking as a solitary dialogue between Me and Myself. This appropriation of Socrates leads her to introduce novel concepts of conscience (which gives no positive prescriptions, but instead, tells me what I cannot do if I would remain friends with myself when I re-enter the two-in-one of thought where I must render an account of my actions to myself) and morality (an entirely negative enterprise concerned with non-participation in certain actions for the sake of remaining friends with one's self).
In the intended third volume of The Life of Mind, Arendt was planning to engage the faculty of judgment by appropriating Kant's Critique of Judgment; however, she did not live to write it. Nevertheless, although her notion of judging remains unknown, Arendt did leave manuscripts ("Thinking and Moral Considerations," "Some Questions on Moral Philosophy,") and lectures (Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy) concerning her thoughts on this mental faculty. The first two articles were edited and published by Jerome Kohn, an assistant of Arendt and a director of Hannah Arendt Center at The New School, and the last was edited and published by Ronald Beiner, professor of political science at the University of Toronto. Her personal library was deposited at Bard College at the Stevenson Library in 1976, and includes approximately 4,000 books, ephemera, and pamphlets from Arendt's last apartment. The college has begun archiving some of the collection digitally, which is available at The Hannah Arendt Collection.[16]
In 2012 a German film titled Hannah Arendt was released, directed by Margarethe von Trotta, and with Barbara Sukowa in the role of Arendt. The film concentrates on the Eichmann trial, and the controversy caused by Arendt's book, which at the time was widely misunderstood as defending Eichmann and blaming Jewish leaders for the Holocaust.
Arendt as depicted in the 2012 film is now the basis for a seminar held at Brown University's Cogut Center for the Humanities.

                                  horrors of European tyranny. Her life was enriched by innovative thought
                                  and ennobled by friendship and love. Although her books addressed a general
                                  audience from the standpoint of disinterested universalism, Jewishness was
                                  an irrepressible feature of her experience as well as a condition that she
                                  in Wilhelmine Germany. Raised in Konigsberg, she was the only child of Paul
                                  and Martha (Cohn) Arendt, both of whom had grown up in Russian-Jewish homes
                                  headed by entrepreneurs. Arendt's childhood was punctuated with grief and
                                  terror. Her father, an engineer, died of paresis (syphilitic insanity) when
                                  Hannah was seven, and episodic battles between Russian and German armies
                                  were fought near their home soon thereafter. Her mother married Martin
                                  Beerwald in 1920, providing Hannah with two older stepsisters, Eva and
                                  1924, Arendt began to study theology that fall with Rudolf Bultmann at the
                                  University of Marburg. Also on the faculty was the young philosopher Martin
                                  Heidegger, whose lectures, which would form the basis of Sein und Zeit [Being and time] (1927), were already inspiring allegiance to and interest
                                  in the emerging Existenzphilosophie. Her brief but passionate affair
                                  with Heidegger, a married man and a father, began in 1925 but ended when
                                  she went on to study at the University of Heidelberg with Karl Jaspers. A
                                  psychiatrist who had converted to philosophy, he became her mentor.
                                  wrote under the name of Günther Anders. That year, she also completed her
                                  dissertation on the idea of love in the thought of St. Augustine and earned
                                  her doctorate. However, the rising anti-Semitism afflicting the German
                                  polity distracted her from metaphysics and compelled her to face the
                                  Varnhagen, a Jewish salon hostess in Berlin in the early 1800's, Arendt
                                  sought to understand how her subject's conversion to Christianity and
                                  repudiation of Jewishness illuminated the conflict between minority status
                                  and German nationalism. Rahel Varnhagen: The Life of a Jewish Woman was not published until 1958. By then, Arendt's great historical subject
                                  was no longer the question of whether Jews were fit to enter the salons,
                                  a political activist and, beginning in 1933, helped the German Zionist
                                  Organization and its leader, Kurt Blumenfeld, to publicize the plight of
                                  the victims of Nazism. She also did research on anti-Semitic propaganda,
                                  for which she was arrested by the Gestapo. But when she won the sympathy of
                                  a Berlin jailer, she was released and escaped to Paris, where she remained
                                  for the rest of the decade. Working especially with Youth Aliyah, Arendt
                                  helped rescue Jewish children from the Third Reich and bring them to Palestine.

                                  divorced, Arendt married Blücher on January 16, 1940. When the Wehrmacht
                                  invaded France less than half a year later, the couple was separated and
                                  interned in southern France along with other stateless Germans. Arendt was
                                  sent to Gurs, from which she escaped. She soon joined her husband, and in
                                  May 1941, both managed to reach neutral America, where her mother was able

                                  the editor and historian Salo W. Baron and his wife, Jeanette M. Baron. In
                                  magazines such as Jewish Frontier and Aufbau [Reconstruction], Arendt argued on behalf of a Jewish army and expressed
                                  the hope that Arabs and Jews might live together in a postwar Palestinian
                                  state. She also served as an editor at Schocken Books, a German Jewish
                                  publishing firm that reestablished itself in New York and in Palestine, and
                                  brought to the attention of English readers the diaries of Franz Kafka and
                                  the fin de sìecle Jewish polemics of Bernard Lazare. After the Holocaust,
                                  Baron put Arendt in charge of Jewish Cultural Reconstruction, the effort to
                                  locate and redistribute the shards of Judaic artifacts and other treasures
                                  that had been salvaged from a doomed civilization. Her second launching pad
                                  was a circle of mostly leftist intellectuals associated with Partisan
                                    Review, especially non-Jews such as Dwight Macdonald and Mary McCarthy.
                                  The critic Alfred Kazin, however, was also invaluable in enhancing the
                                  steps toward the distinctive twentieth-century tyrannies of Hitler and Stalin, or in measuring how grievously wounded Western civilization and the
                                  human status itself had become. She demonstrated how embedded racism was in
                                  Central and Western European societies by the end of the nineteenth
                                  century, and how imperialism experimented with the possibilities of
                                  unspeakable cruelty and mass murder. The third section of her book exposed
                                  prisoners in the death camps marked a horrifying discontinuity in European
                                  history itself. Totalitarianism put into practice what had been imagined
                                  only in the medieval depictions of hell. In the 1950s, The Origins of
                                    Totalitarianism engendered much doubt, especially by drawing parallels
                                  ideological conflicts and their savage warfare from 1941 to 1945). The
                                  parallelism continues to stir skepticism in some readers, especially
                                  because of the unavailability and unfamiliarity of Russian sources when the
                                  book was researched and written. But Arendt's emphasis on the plight of the
                                  Jews amid the decline of Enlightenment ideals of human rights, and her
                                  insistence that the Third Reich was conducting two warsone against the
                                  Allies, the other against the Jewish peoplehave become commonplaces of
                                  Jewish historiography. Much of her book is stunningly original, and
                                  virtually every paragraph is ablaze with insight. More than any other
                                  subterranean sources within Western society, but pushing to unprecedented
                                  extremes murderous fantasies of domination and revenge. An expanded edition
                                  of The Origins of Totalitarianism was published in 1958, taking into
Arendt's next three books--The Human Condition (1958), Between Past and Future (1961), and On Revolution (1968)--could be characterized by a yearning to reconstruct political
                                  philosophy rather than to explore the devolution of political history.
                                  Remarkably enough, in 1963 she also published what proved to be the most

                                  followed orders, rather than a raving ideologue animated by demonic anti-Semitism, was strikingly original. Far from embodying "radical
                                  peculiarities of the Third Reich. While accepting the validity of Israeli
                                  jurisdiction and considering the Israeli court's verdict imposing the death
                                  sentence on Eichmann just, Arendt also offered her own justifications for
                                  capital punishment. Eichmann had not wanted to share the earth with the
                                  Jews; therefore, the Jewish state had no reason to share the earth with
                                  him. Almost in passing, she also claimed that fewer than six million Jews
                                  would have died if the Jewish councils had not collaborated to various
                                  degrees with Nazis like Eichmann. Even anarchy and noncooperation would
                                  occupiers were traditional anti-Semites who might somehow be bribed or
                                  appeased. Her attribution of some responsibility for the catastrophe to the
                                  provoked a considerable historical literature that investigated the
                                  behavior of Jewish communities under Nazi occupation. The subsequent debate
The storm over the book's apparent elevation of Eichmann's character and denial of Jewish innocence frayed whatever bonds
                                  still tied Arendt to the organized Jewish community. Some segments mounted
                                  a propaganda campaign against the arguments that she advanced. Although Eichmann in Jerusalem is hardly free of factual error or bias, Arendt's
                                  critics tended to miss her subtlety and to ignore the relation between her
                                  book and the grandeur of her philosophy. She held the victims of the Final
                                  Solution accountable for inadequate and ill-conceived political action, and
                                  conditions. But Arendt also wrote as though the modernization associated
                                  with the rise of mass society made problematic the classical injunction to
                                  nationalism (even sometimes on behalf of Jews) had obscured the ideals of
                                  rational speech and meaningful deeds that she especially celebrated in The
                                    Human Condition. But nearly all of her books suggest a struggle to
                                  reclaim the possibilities of freedom grounded in the sense of a shared
                                  because he had a sadistic will to do so, nor because he had been deeply
                                  infected by the bacillus of anti-Semitism, but because he failed to think
                                  through what he was doing (his thoughtlessness). This theory led Arendt to
                                  conceptualize the neo-Kantian meditations on judgment in her posthumously

                                  Jewish identity was so inescapable an aspect of her sensibility that, when
                                  beginning a lecture in Cologne less than a decade after World War II, she
                                  whose polemics combined hostility to anti-Semitism with opposition to the
                                  timorous parvenus who often fancied themselves the representatives of the
                                  Jewish masses. As her friend Mary McCarthy once recalled, Israel was
                                  that "any real catastrophe in Israel would affect me more deeply than
                                  anything else." When such a disaster was avoided in 1967, the victory
                                  and not always accurate. Arendt died unconsecrated by a religious ceremony
                                  (her ashes are buried at Bard College, where Blucher taught), and the
                                  religious affiliation." Her dissertation topic had been a Christian
                                  saint, and she later wrote dazzlingly on the goodness of Jesus. Yet it
                                  could be argued that the primary influences upon her thought were Hellenic
                                  philosophy-and German philosophy itself. Arendt denied harboring any
                                  special love for the Jewish people (ahavat Yisrael). Since Diaspora Jewry
                                  had been denied the public space in which she believed human excellence
                                  should be cultivated, Arendt admitted that she could neither admire nor
                                  binational state in the Near East quietly distanced her from the organized
                                  Jewish community, whose resources would henceforth be mounted on behalf of
                                  United States provided (an appreciation that its academic institutions and
                                  audiences reciprocated by recognizing her gifts), it is difficult to detect
                                  any significant American influences upon her work. Arendt was supremely a
                                  product of Weimar culture. She had its awareness of both the brilliance of
                                  Jewish achievement and the fragility of the Jewish status. She shared its
                                  modernist sense of the disrupted ties to the classical heritage that her
                                  pessimism. Finally, she reflected its disdain for the petty compromises of
                                  cosmopolitanism that transcend the tastes of the masses. Like Heidegger,
                                  she was entranced by the poetic and philosophical resources of the German

                                  intellectuals, Arendt noticed the strangeness of the familiar and sought to
                                  clarify the senselessness of modern history. But like very few others,
                                  Arendt managed to stamp with individual authority a body of work that is

=======================================================
                    Hannah Arendt was born in Hanover Germany in 1906. She began her formal studies at Marburg University in 1924 and was briefly a student and lover of Martin Heidegger. Arendt continued her education at Freiburg and Heidelburg Universities completing her doctoral dissertation Love and Saint Augustine (Liebesbegriff bei Augustin) at Heidelburg in 1929 under the supervision of Karl Jaspers. In the early 1930’s Arendt was active in the German Zionist Organization, led by Kurt Blumenfeld,. While conducting research for the organization Arendt was arrested by the Gestapo and detained at Alexanderplatz. As she later told, she got on well with her young German guard who let her walk free.  She and her then husband Günther Stern fled to Paris, where Arendt completed her biography of Rahel Varnhagen, which remained unpublished until the late 1950’s.While in France she worked for the organization Youth Aliyah that rescued Jewish youth from the Third Reich; after the War, Arendt returned to the group to help facilitate the relocation of the over 20,000 children they had rescued. In 1936 Arendt and Stern separated and Arendt became involved with Heinrich Blücher. The two married in 1940, Arendt was again imprisoned in a concentration camp, Camp Gurs in the southwest of France. After narrowly escaping, she and Blucher fled Nazi Europe, coming to New York in 1941. She and Blücher lived on Riverside Drive in NYC and in Kingston, NY (near Bard College where Blücher taught for 17 years). They remained devoted to one another until Blücher’s death in 1970.In the United States Arendt was part of the intellectual circle surrounding the Partisan Review, where she met life-long friend Mary McCarthy. Arendt taught at numerous American universities including the University of Chicago, Berkeley, and Princeton University, where she was the first woman awarded a full professorship. She came to be most closely associated with the New School for Social Research, where she served as professor of political philosophy until her death.The 1950’s saw the publication of what are commonly considered Arendt’s major works: her comprehensive study of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes The Origins of Totalitarianism in 1951, and her opus The Human Condition in 1958. In 1961 Arendt covered the trial of Nazi official Adolf Eichmann for The New Yorker, the installments of which became the 1963 book Eichmann in Jerusulem: A Report on the Banality of Evil. The same year brought the publication of On Revolution, followed by the essay anthologies, Men in Dark Times and Crisis of the Republic. Arendt died of heart failure in 1975 after completing the first two volumes of her trilogy The Life of the Mind, on Thinking and Willing, and beginning work on the final volume Judging.An activist and thinker whose work resists simple categorization, the stunning lucidity of Arendt’s writing resonates with both scholars and the reading public. Her writing continues to delight and to inspire, even as she asks us to confront the most haunting questions of our time.

"An exemplary biography of one of the leading intellectual luminaries among the Jews from Germany who emigrated to this country in the wake of the Nazi rise to power. . . . Equally at home is discussing philosophical issues, offering psychological reflections, and simply recounting the life struggles of an immigrant and her community, the author has shared with us a portrait that will contribute greatly to our understanding of the century through which we have lived."from the citation for the 1982 Kenneth B. Smilen Present Tense Award for the best book in Biography/Autobiography (on the earlier edition)"Elisabeth Young-Bruehl's Hannah Arendt is to be commended for its impressive mastery of twentieth-century central European history and its keen perception of the way events and philosophical probings coalesced in this displaced intellectual. The intimate exploration of Arendt's life and friendships illuminates the importance of her contribution to twentieth-century American thought, both through her writings and through her strong personal presence."YUP Governor's Award citation (on the earlier edition)Winner of the 1983 Alfred Harcourt Prize Award for Biography and Memoirs Nominated for the 1983 National Jewish Book Award in History
This highly acclaimed, prize-winning biography of one of the foremost political philosophers of the twentieth century is here reissued in a trade paperback edition for a new generation of readers. In a new preface the author offers an account of writings by and about Arendt that have appeared since the book’s 1982 publication, providing a reassessment of her subject’s life and achievement. Praise for the earlier edition:“Both a personal and an intellectual biography . . . It represents biography at its best.”—Peter Berger, front page, The New York Times Book Review “A story of surprising drama . . . .
