David Paul Cronenberg, OC OOnt FRSC (born March 15, 1943)[1] is a Canadian filmmaker, screenwriter and actor. He is one of the principal originators of what is commonly known as the body horror or venereal horror genre. This style of filmmaking explores people's fears of bodily transformation and infection. In his films, the psychological is typically intertwined with the physical. In the first half of his career, he explored these themes mostly through horror and science fiction, although his work has since expanded beyond these genres. He has been called "the most audacious and challenging narrative director in the English-speaking world."[2]
Born in Toronto, Canada, Cronenberg was the son of Esther (née Sumberg), a musician, and Milton Cronenberg, a writer and editor.[3] He was raised in a "middle-class progressive Jewish family".[4][5] He began writing as a child and wrote constantly. He attended high school at Harbord Collegiate Institute. A keen interest in science, especially botany and lepidopterology, led him to enter the Honours Science program at the University of Toronto in 1963, but he switched to Honors English Language and Literature later in his first year. Cronenberg's fascination with the film Winter Kept Us Warm (1966) by classmate David Secter sparked his interest in film. He began frequenting film camera rental houses, learning art of filmmaking and made two 16mm films (Transfer and From the Drain). Inspired by the New York underground film scene, he founded the Toronto Film Co-op with Iain Ewing and Ivan Reitman. After taking a year off to travel in Europe, he returned to Canada in 1967, graduating from University College at the top of his class.[6]

After two short sketch films and two short art-house features (the black and white Stereo and the colour Crimes of the Future) Cronenberg went into partnership with Ivan Reitman. The Canadian government provided financing for his films throughout the 1970s. He alternated his signature "body horror" films such as Shivers with projects reflecting his interest in car racing and bike gangs (Fast Company). Rabid exploited the unexpected acting talents of pornographic actress Marilyn Chambers (Cronenberg's first choice was a young, then-unknown Sissy Spacek). Rabid was a breakthrough with international distributors and his next two horror features gained stronger support.
Cronenberg's films follow a definite progression: a movement from the social world to the inner life. In his early films, scientists modify human bodies, which results in the breakdown of social order (e.g. Shivers, Rabid). In his middle period, the chaos wrought by the scientist is more personal, (e.g. The Brood, Scanners, Videodrome). In the later period, the scientist himself is altered by his experiment (e.g. his remake of The Fly). This trajectory culminates in Dead Ringers in which a twin pair of gynecologists spiral into codependency and drug addiction. His later films tend more to the psychological, often contrasting subjective and objective realities (eXistenZ, M. Butterfly, Spider).[citation needed]
Cronenberg has cited William S. Burroughs and Vladimir Nabokov as influences.[7] Perhaps the best example of a film that straddles the line between his works of personal chaos and psychological confusion is Cronenberg's "adaptation" of his literary hero William S. Burroughs' most controversial book, Naked Lunch. The book was considered "unfilmable" and Cronenberg acknowledged that a straight translation into film would "cost 100 million dollars and be banned in every country in the world". Instead—much like in his earlier film, Videodrome—he consistently blurred the lines between what appeared to be reality and what appeared to be hallucinations brought on by the main character's drug addiction. Some of the book's "moments" (as well as incidents loosely based upon Burroughs' life) are presented in this manner within the film. Cronenberg stated that while writing the screenplay for Naked Lunch, he felt a moment of synergy with the writing style of Burroughs. He felt the connection between his screenwriting style and Burroughs' prose style was so strong, that he jokingly remarked that should Burroughs pass on, "I'll just write his next book."[citation needed]
Cronenberg has said that his films should be seen "from the point of view of the disease", and that, for example, he identifies with the characters in Shivers after they become infected with the anarchic parasites. Disease and disaster, in Cronenberg's work, are less problems to be overcome than agents of personal transformation. Of his characters' transformations, Cronenberg said, "But because of our necessity to impose our own structure of perception on things we look on ourselves as being relatively stable. But, in fact, when I look at a person I see this maelstrom of organic, chemical and electron chaos; volatility and instability, shimmering; and the ability to change and transform and transmute."[8] Similarly, in Crash (1996), people who have been injured in car crashes attempt to view their ordeal as "a fertilizing rather than a destructive event". In 2005, Cronenberg would say that he was upset that Paul Haggis had chosen the same name for his Academy Award winning film Crash, feeling it was "stupid" and "very disrespectful."[9]
Aside from The Dead Zone (1983) and The Fly, Cronenberg has not generally worked within the world of big-budget, mainstream Hollywood filmmaking, although he has had occasional near misses. At one stage he was considered by George Lucas as a possible director for Return of the Jedi but was passed. Cronenberg also worked for nearly a year on a version of Total Recall but experienced "creative differences" with producers Dino De Laurentiis and Ronald Shusett. A different version of the film was eventually made by Paul Verhoeven. A fan of Philip K. Dick, author of "We Can Remember it For You Wholesale," the short story upon which the film was based, Cronenberg related (in the biography/overview of his work, Cronenberg on Cronenberg) that his dissatisfaction with what he envisioned the film to be and what it ended up being pained him so greatly that for a time, he suffered a migraine just thinking about it, akin to a needle piercing his eye.
In the late 1990s, Cronenberg was announced as director of a sequel to another Verhoeven film, Basic Instinct, but this also fell through. His recent work, the thriller A History of Violence (2005), is one of his highest budgeted and most accessible to date. He has said that the decision to direct it was influenced by his having had to defer some of his salary on the low-budgeted Spider, but it is one of his most critically acclaimed films to date, along with Eastern Promises (2007) a film about the struggle of one man to gain power in the Russian Mafia.
Cronenberg has collaborated with composer Howard Shore on all of his films since The Brood (1979), (see List of noted film director and composer collaborations) with the exception of The Dead Zone (1983), which was scored by Michael Kamen. Other regular collaborators include actor Robert Silverman, art director Carol Spier, sound editor Bryan Day, film editor Ronald Sanders, his sister, costume designer Denise Cronenberg, and, from 1979 until 1988, cinematographer Mark Irwin. In 2008, Cronenberg directed Howard Shore's first opera, The Fly.
Since 1988's Dead Ringers, Cronenberg has worked with cinematographer Peter Suschitzky on each of his films (see List of film director and cinematographer collaborations). Suschitzky was the director of photography for The Empire Strikes Back, and Cronenberg remarked that Suschitzky's work in that film "was the only one of those movies that actually looked good",[10] which was a motivating factor to work with him on Dead Ringers.
Having worked with many Hollywood stars, Cronenberg says that he did not get to make a film with an actor he wanted to work with for a long time, Burt Reynolds. Cronenberg remains a staunchly Canadian filmmaker, with nearly all of his films (including major studio vehicles The Dead Zone and The Fly) having been filmed in his home province Ontario. Notable exceptions include M. Butterfly, most of which was shot in China, Spider and Eastern Promises, which were both filmed primarily in England, and A Dangerous Method, which was filmed in Germany and Austria. Rabid and Shivers were shot in and around Montreal. Most of his films have been at least partially financed by Telefilm Canada, and Cronenberg is a vocal supporter of government-backed film projects, saying "Every country needs [a system of government grants] in order to have a national cinema in the face of Hollywood".[11]
Cronenberg has also appeared as an actor in other directors' films. Most of his roles are cameo appearances, as in Into The Night, Jason X, To Die For, Blood and Donuts and Alias, but on occasion he has played major roles, as in Nightbreed or Last Night. He has not played major roles in any of his own films, but he did put in a brief appearance as a gynecologist in The Fly; he can also be glimpsed among the sex-crazed hordes in Shivers; he can be heard as an unseen car-pound attendant in Crash; his hands can be glimpsed in eXistenZ; and he appeared as a stand-in for James Woods in Videodrome for shots in which Woods' character wore a helmet that covered his head.
In 2008 Cronenberg realized two extra-cinematographic projects: the exhibition Chromosomes at the Rome Film Fest and the opera The Fly at the LaOpera in Los Angeles and Theatre Châtelet in Paris. In July 2010, Cronenberg completed production on A Dangerous Method, an adaptation of Christopher Hampton's play The Talking Cure, starring Keira Knightley, Michael Fassbender, and frequent collaborator Viggo Mortensen. The film was produced by independent British producer Jeremy Thomas.[12][13]
In the October 2011 edition of Rue Morgue, Cronenberg stated that he has written a companion piece to his 1986 remake of The Fly, which he would like to direct if given the chance. He has stated that it is not a traditional sequel, but rather a "parallel story".
For a time it appeared that, as Eastern Promises producer Paul Webster told Screen International, a sequel is in the works that would reunite the key team of Cronenberg, Steven Knight and Viggo Mortensen. The film was to be made by Webster's new production company Shoebox Films in collaboration with Focus Features and to be shot in early 2013.[16] However, in an in-person interview held at the Apple Store Soho on August 16, 2012, Cronenberg commented that the financing for the "Eastern Promises" sequel had fallen through about two weeks earlier.
Filming for Cronenberg's next film, a satire drama entitled Maps to the Stars—with Julianne Moore, John Cusack and Robert Pattinson[17][18]—began on July 8, 2013 in Toronto, Ontario and Los Angeles.[19][20] This was the first time Cronenberg filmed in the United States.
In a September 2013 interview, Cronenberg stated that he is not concerned about posthumous representations of his film work: "It wouldn't disturb me to think that my work would just sink beneath the waves without trace and that would be it. So what? It doesn't bother me." In the same interview, Cronenberg revealed that it depends on the "time of day" as to whether he is afraid of death.[21]
He first married Margaret Hindson in 1972: then his seven-year marriage ended in 1979 amidst personal and professional differences. They had one daughter, Cassandra Cronenberg. Now he is married to Carolyn Zeifman, production assistant on Rabid. They have two children, Caitlin and Brandon.[22] In the 1992 book Cronenberg on Cronenberg, he revealed that The Brood was inspired by events that occurred during the unraveling of his first marriage, which caused both Cronenberg and his daughter Cassandra a great deal of turmoil. The character Nola Carveth, mother of the brood, is based on Cassandra's mother. Cronenberg said that he found the shooting of the climactic scene, in which Nola was strangled by her husband, to be "very satisfying".[23] Cronenberg lives in Toronto.[1]
Cronenberg describes himself as an atheist.[24][25] His atheism was further explained in a September 2013 interview:
Anytime I've tried to imagine squeezing myself into the box of any particular religion, I find it claustrophobic and oppressive. I think atheism is an acceptance of what is real.[21]
In the same interview, Cronenberg revealed that film director Martin Scorsese admitted to him that he was intrigued by Cronenberg's early work but was subsequently "terrified" to meet him in person. Cronenberg stated to Scorsese in response: "You're the guy who made Taxi Driver and you're afraid to meet me?"[21]
Cronenberg has appeared on various "Greatest Director" lists. In 2004, Science Fiction magazine Strange Horizons named him the 2nd greatest director in the history of the genre, ahead of better known directors such as Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Jean-Luc Godard and Ridley Scott.[26] In the same year, The Guardian listed him 9th on their list of "The world's 40 best directors".[27] In 2007, Total Film named him as the 17th greatest director of all-time.[28]
Cronenberg received the Special Jury Prize at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival for Crash.[29] In 1999, Cronenberg was inducted onto Canada's Walk of Fame[30] and was awarded with the Silver Bear Award at the 49th Berlin International Film Festival.[31]
In 2002, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, and in 2006 he was awarded the Cannes Film Festival's lifetime achievement award, the Carrosse d'Or.[32] Also in 2006, Cronenberg was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, the senior national body of distinguished Canadian scientists and scholars.[33] In 2009 Cronenberg received the Légion d'honneur from the government of France.[34] The following year Cronenberg was named an honorary patron of the University Philosophical Society, Trinity College, Dublin.[citation needed] In 2012, he received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.[35]
The opening of the "David Cronenberg: Evolution" Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) exhibition will occur on October 30, 2013. Held at the TIFF Bell Lightbox venue, the exhibition pays tribute to the director's entire filmmaking career and the festival's promotional material refers to Cronenberg as "one of Canada's most prolific and iconic filmmakers". The exhibition will be shown internationally following the conclusion of the TIFF showing on January 19, 2014.[21][36]
In 2014, he was made a Member of the Order of Ontario in recognition for being "Canada's most celebrated internationally acclaimed filmmaker".[37]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          David Cronenberg, also known as the King of Venereal Horror or the Baron of Blood, was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in 1943. His father was a journalist, and his mother was a piano player. After showing an inclination for literature at an early age (he wrote and published eerie short stories, thus following his father's path) and for music (playing classical guitar until he was 12), Cronenberg graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in Literature after switching from the science department. He reached the cult status of horror-meister with the gore-filled, modern-vampire variations of Shivers (1975) and Rabid (1977), following an experimental apprenticeship in independent film-making and in Canadian television programs.Cronenberg gained popularity with the head-exploding, telepathy-based Scanners (1981) after the release of the much underrated, controversial, and autobiographical The Brood (1979). Cronenberg become a sort of a mass media guru with Videodrome (1983), a shocking investigation of the hazards of reality-morphing television and a prophetic critique of contemporary aesthetics. The issues of tech-induced mutation of the human body and topics of the prominent dichotomy between body and mind were back again in The Dead Zone (1983) and The Fly (1986), both bright examples of a personal film-making identity, even if both films are based on mass-entertainment materials: the first being a rendition of a Stephen King best-seller, the latter a remake of famous American horror movie.With Dead Ringers (1988) and Naked Lunch (1991), the Canadian director, no more a mere genre movie-maker but a fully realized auteur, got the acclaim of international critics. Such profound statements on modern humanity and ever-changing society are prominent in the provocative Crash (1996) and in the virtual reality essay of eXistenZ (1999), both of which well fared at the Cannes and Berlin Film Festivals. In the last two filmic projects Spider (2002) and A History of Violence (2005), Cronenberg avoids expressing his teratologic and oniric expressionism in favor of a more psychological exploration of human contradictions and idiosyncrasies.
        His films generally involve the horror caused by a mutation, by a parasite, or by particular medical conditions.
        Often uses Canada as a filming location (The Fly (1986), _A History Of Violence (2005)_, Videodrome (1983), Dead Ringers (1988)
      Was set to direct Total Recall (1990). He even wrote a few drafts of the script before Paul Verhoeven took over.
John Carpenter paid homage to him in Escape from New York (1981). One of the United States Police Force guards is on the line with Hauk, then adds that Cronenberg is on the line for him. Another person paid homage to in the movie was George A. Romero, who had Isaac Hayes's right-hand man named after him.
      Directed an episode of Friday the 13th (1987), The Services, called Faith Healer. 13 years later, he appeared in the Friday the 13th film (unreleated to the series), Jason X (2001).
      Was offered the chance to direct Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) but he declined.
      His crew referred to the final Brundlefly monster seen in the climax of The Fly (1986) as the Space Bug.
      Father was a bookstore owner and sometime columnist for the Toronto Telegram. Mother was a piano rehearsal accompanist for the National Ballet.
      Cites Winter Kept Us Warm (1965) as his inspiration for becoming a filmmaker. It was screened at the University of Toronto when he was a student.
      Has admired bugs and insects since childhood. This fascination has lingered on, and can be felt through many of his films.
      At one point he was in line to direct The Singing Detective (2003), with Al Pacino in the lead.
      His regular cinematographer until 1988 was Mark Irwin until Dead Ringers (1988), on which Irwin was unable to work because of his commitment to The Blob (1988). Cronenberg then hired Peter Suschitzky, who became his regular cinematographer, and Cronenberg and Irwin have not worked together since then.
      His father was a journalist and his mother played the piano. These roles are reversed in The Fly (1986), in which Jeff Goldblum plays the piano to impress Geena Davis, who plays a journalist.
      Has directed 2 actors to Oscar nominations: William Hurt (Best Supporting Actor, A History of Violence (2005)) and Viggo Mortensen (Best Actor, Eastern Promises (2007)).
      It's my conceit that perhaps some diseases perceived as diseases that destroy a well-functioning machine actually turn it into a new but still well-functioning machine with a different purpose. The AIDS virus: look at it from its point of view. Very vital, very excited, really having a good time. It's really a triumph if you're a virus. See the movies from the disease's point of view. You can see why they would resist all attempts to destroy them. These are all cerebral games, but they have emotional correlatives as well.
      Since I see technology as being an extension of the human body, it's inevitable that it should come home to roost.
      My dentist said to me the other day: I've enough problems in my life, so why should I see your films?
      You have to believe in God before you can say there are things that man was not meant to know. I don't think there's anything man wasn't meant to know. There are just some stupid things that people shouldn't do.
      Everybody's a mad scientist, and life is their lab. We're all trying to experiment to find a way to live, to solve problems, to fend off madness and chaos.
      Drugs and creativity don't go together for me. Like everybody in the '60s, I had one acid trip and some cocaine and hash, you know, the stuff everyone did. But it's been 30 or 40 years since I bothered to do that. What I need is clarity. Even not having enough sleep is a problem for me, never mind doing any kind of drugs.
      "Yeah, it is metaphorical...it isn't just a special effect in a vacuum." - on the exploding head in Scanners (1981).
      When you're in the muck, you can only see muck. If you somehow manage to float above it, you still see the muck, but you see it from a different perspective. And you see other things, too. That's the consolation of philosophy.
      All stereotypes turn out to be true. This is a horrifying thing about life. All those things you fought against as a youth: you begin to realize they're stereotypes because they're true.
      I think of horror films as art, as films of confrontations. Films that make you confront aspects of your own life that are difficult to face. Just because you're making a horror film doesn't mean you can't make an artful film.
      If you look at a baby, the most fascinating thing to a baby, a newborn, is the human face. The baby will look at your face and watch your face move and want to touch it. If it's a fantastic head and what it's talking about is fantastic, then you can't have anything better. It's the best!
      Civilization is repression. You don't get civilization without repression of the unconscious, of the id. And the basic appeal of art is to the unconscious. Therefore, art is somewhat subversive of civilization. And yet at the same time it seems necessary for civilization. You don't get civilization without art.
      You need language for thought, and you need language to anticipate death. There is no abstract thought without language and no anticipation. I think the anticipation of death without language would be impossible.
      If religion is used to allow you to come to terms with death, and also to guide you in how you live your life, then I think art can do the same thing. But in a schematic way, in a much less rigid and absolute way, which is why it appeals to me and religion doesn't.
      The versions of The Dead Zone (1983) and The Fly (1986) that you find on video carry my name, and they are the films that I made, but I hate the way they look on tape. Too bright.
      I have no rules. For me, it's a full, full experience to make a movie. It takes a lot of time, and I want there to be a lot of stuff in it. You're looking for every shot in the movie to have resonance and want it to be something you can see a second time, and then I'd like it to be something you can see 10 years later, and it becomes a different movie, because you're a different person. So that means I want it to be deep, not in a pretentious way, but I guess I can say I am pretentious in that I pretend. I have aspirations that the movie should trigger off a lot of complex responses.
      As filmmaker, I ask questions but don't have answers. Moviemaking is a philosophical exploration. I invite the audience to come on the journey and discover what they think and feel.
      My movies are body-conscious. The first fact of human existence is the human body. If you get away from physical reality, you're fudging, in fantasy land, not coming to grips with what violence does.
      We question a country's self-mythology. Perfect town and perfect family are - like Westerns - part of America's mythology, involving notions of past innocence and naïveté. But is it possible for innocence to exist while something heinous transpires elsewhere? What does it take for a country to be rich and prosperous? What does that country do to the world?
      To me, the life that we live is heaven. My idea of paradise is life on Earth. But we often don't know it, and can't see it that way, until, I'm sure, we start to leave it. I guess that's the way I feel about film.
      (on being voted the Peoples Choice at the 2007 T.I.F.F.) I feel like I've just been elected prime minister of Canada!
      When we talk about violence, we're talking about the destruction of the human body, and I don't lose sight of that. In general, my filmmaking is fairly body-oriented, because what you're photographing is people, bodies. You can't really photograph an abstract concept, whereas a novelist can write about that. You have to photograph something physical. So that combination of things suggests to me a particular way to deal with violence. And it's not a bad thing that people really understand what violence is. It's not, however, a politically correct thing I do. I'm not a big fan of political correctness. It's very detrimental to art in general. An artist's responsibility is to be irresponsible. As soon as you start to think about social or political responsibility, you've amputated the best limbs you've got as an artist. You are plugging into a very restrictive system that is going to push and mold you, and is going to make your art totally useless and ineffective.
      If I were doing a comedy with somebody slipping on a banana peel, I wouldn't show the reality of slipping on a banana peel, which could be quite horrific, involving cracked skulls and broken spines and crippling. You have to do what's appropriate to the movie.
      When I am doing art, I have absolutely no social responsibilities whatsoever -- it's like dreaming.
      People ask me how is it to direct special effects? Is it fun? And in fact it's kind of like getting a performance out of a bowl of shrimp salad actually, because it lies there and it's kind of you know, it's agonizing and I hate it, directing special effects I like working with actors and it's much more fun.
      [on awards] It can be very exhausting if you're nominated, so at a certain moment, part of you is almost praying you don't get any nominations.
      [on Michael Fassbender] Even with an intellectual character, his approach is visceral. He jokingly likes to say the only research he did was read 'The Idiots Guide to Carl Jung'. He's just so perky it drives you crazy. One day I found him standing out in the sun in his costume and makeup, with this big smile. I said to him, 'Michael, why are you smiling like that?' He said, 'I don't know... life.' I said, 'It's so irritating that you're happy all the time.'
      [on embracing digital film recording] I have no particular affection for 'film'. It's about time film died its natural death. However, the filmmaking process is exactly the same. Why would you ever want to shoot film? Well, I don't.
      I have no demons. I was always a nature boy. I loved nature and animals and insects. And [Brandon] proved to have that same kind of sensibility, which undoubtedly has something to do with the kind of movies I've made and that he seems to be making as well. It comes from a real affection for the strangeness of animal life on earth. I's very pure and very direct.
      [on son Brandon's developing interest in film-making] I noticed he was incredibly sensitive to the music of film. He knew what scary music was. He'd run away.
      [on working with Patrick McGoohan on Scanners (1981)] He had extreme Catholic views about sexuality, which came onto the set. My leading lady... came to me incredibly distraught and said, 'Patrick said, 'Are you a whore? Are you a slut?' And he started to lay into her because she'd had, like, five husbands. That was Patrick, and those were the things I had to deal with as a relatively young director. He was probably the most difficult actor I ever worked with, though he gave a fantastic performance.
      [on working with Patrick McGoohan on Scanners (1981)] He's a brilliant actor; the voice, the charisma, the presence, the face. Phenomenal. And he was aging so well; he looked so great in that beard. But he was so angry. His self-hatred came out as anger against everybody and everything. He said to me, 'If I didn't drink I'd be afraid I'd kill someone.' He looks at you that way and you just say, 'Keep drinking.' It's all self-destructive, because it's all self-hating. That's my theory. He was also terrified. The second before we went to shoot he said, 'I'm scared.' I wasn't shocked; Olivier said that he was terrified each time he had to go on stage. With Patrick, though, it was just so raw and so scary-full of anger and potent. But he was sensing the disorganization; the script wasn't there, so he was right to worry about it. He didn't know me. He didn't know whether I could bring it off or not. We parted from the film not on very good terms ultimately.
      [on The Dark Knight Rises as 'art'] I don't think they are making them an elevated art form. I think it's still Batman running around in a stupid cape. I just don't think it's elevated. Christopher Nolan's best movie is Memento, and that is an interesting movie. I don't think his Batman movies are half as interesting, though they're 20 million times the expense.
      [on Christopher Nolan] What he is doing is some very interesting technical stuff, which, you know, he's shooting IMAX and in 3-D. That's really tricky and difficult to do. I read about it in American Cinematography Magazine, and technically, that's all very interesting. The movies, to me, they're mostly boring.
      [on superhero movies] But a superhero movie, by definition, you know, it's comic book. It's for kids. It's adolescent in its core. That has always been its appeal, and I think people who are saying, you know, Dark Knight Rises is, you know, supreme cinema art, I don't think they know what the fuck they're talking about.
      Frankly, I don't like seeing my old films. When you make a movie, it's yours. It's in your control, up to a certain point. And, after that, you let it go. It flies out. It's like having a kid. It's a cliche but your 'kid' becomes an individual creature in the world. It intersects with people you don't know, and it has experiences you don't control anymore, and that's what you want. So, unlike your children, whom you might invite home to dinner, I don't invite my films home to dinner.
      I think I can say that the characters in my films don't really I respond to a political stance or a schematic. They're not meant to be an illustration of a theory.. I never really worry about a character being sympathetic or not. That, to me, is a very Hollywood attitude, but it's not an attitude you find in, let's say, European films of that time.
      [on a reluctance to revisit his earlier movies for re-editing purposes] I really think of a film as being part of an archaeological dig, you know? And you want it to be as close to what it was in its time as possible.
      There's an entire generation of Americans who have been spawned in the back seat of a 1954 Ford. So it's not like I invented sex in cars.

David Cronenberg, is a Candadian Filmmaker and teacher. He was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on March 15, 1943. David Cronenberg is a well known film director whose career started in 1969. David Cronenberg is influenced by the works of William Burroughs and Vladimir Nabokov. David Cronenberg's films are concernered with questions of bodily transformations and infection. It is for the previous reasons, and his unique style that he is credited with originating the genre "body horror". David Conenberg's unique cinematic vision can be described as disembodied and often incorporate themes of flesh, parasites and horror caused by mutation or a medical affliction.
David Cronenbergs father Esther (née Sumberg) was a musician. His mother, Milton Cronenberg, was a writer and editor. As a child David Cronenberg played classical guitar until he was twelve. As a young adult Cronenberg was already at work in the direction of body horror, sneaking away in his spare time to write spooky short stories. David Cronenberg grew up in a middle-class progressive Jewish family. David Cronenberg attended Harbord Collegiate Institute. He later started studying science at the University College, University of Toronto but ended up changing his degree and graduating in the literature department. David was married to Margaret Hindson from 19701977 and has been married to Caroline Zeifman since 1979.
The 1999 film by David Cronenberg, eXistenZ features the talents of movie stars Jude Law and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Surrealism influences the films artistic and narrative formation. The film is a psychological thriller that takes an introspective look at how humans and technology interact in the realm of the video game. Like many of Cronenberg's other films, eXistenZ displays strong elements of surrealism. As in Videodrome, Cronenberg gives his psychological statement about how humans react and interact with the technologies that surround them. In this case, the world of video games. The film recieved positive reviews and son several adwards at international festivals. In an interview about the film with Spliced Wire Cronenberg says, "I see technology as being an extension of the human body...It's inevitable that it should come home to roost."
David Cronenberg's work is influenced by the philosophy of René Descartes. David Cronenbergs early career began with short films and art-house features. His art house films were Stereo and Crimes of the Future. After obtaining funding and from the Canadian government during the 70s we see his films move to new frontiers. A fresh collaboration with Ivan Reitman also played a cruicial role in his artistic development. Moving from his body horror films he began to do films focused on automotive themes.The film Shivers looks at the world from the perspective of a parasite. His next film Rabid (1977) was an international breakout film for Cronenberg helping him gain financial support for his next films. Rabid starred Marilyn Chambers, a former porn star. The film grossed seven million dollars and only cost $700,000 to produce. Dead Ringers (1988) and Naked Lunch (1991) really moved David Cronenberg to the next level as a Canadian director with the acclaim of international critics.
When we talk about violence, we're talking about the destruction of the human body, and I don't lose sight of that. In general, my filmmaking is fairly body-oriented, because what you're photographing is people, bodies. You can't really photograph an abstract concept, whereas a novelist can write about that. You have to photograph something physical. So that combination of things suggests to me a particular way to deal with violence. And it's not a bad thing that people really understand what violence is. It's not, however, a politically correct thing I do. I'm not a big fan of political correctness. It's very detrimental to art in general. An artist's responsibility is to be irresponsible. As soon as you start to think about social or political responsibility, you've amputated the best limbs you've got as an artist. You are plugging into a very restrictive system that is going to push and mold you, and is going to make your art totally useless and ineffective.
David Cronenberg has been moving into the mainstream a bit in his more recent films such as the London mob drama ,Eastern Promises and the graphic novel adaptation A History of Violece. Cosmopolis continues this direction. David Cronenberg's film Cosmopolis star's Robert Pattinson of Twilight fame. Robert Pattinson will play 28 year old Eric Packer who is an assest manager. The film is an adaptation of Don DeLillo's 2003 novel.
David Cronenberg directed several feature films, including: Stereo (1969), Crimes of the Future (1970), Shivers (1975), Rabid (1977), Fast Company (1979), The Brood (1979), Scanners (1981), Videodrome (1983), The Dead Zone (1983), The Fly (1986), Dead Ringers (1988), Naked Lunch (1991), M. Butterfly (1993), Crash (1996), eXistenZ (1999), Spider (2002), A History of Violence (2005) and Eastern Promises (2007).
Cronenberg directed several television spots, commercials, and short films including: Transfer (1966), From the Drain (1967), Secret Weapons (1972), The Victim (1975), The Lie Chair (1975), The Italian Machine (1976), Camera (2000), and To Each His Own Cinema (Chacun son cinéma) (2007)
In 1999, Cronenberg was inducted onto Canada's Walk of Fame. In 2002, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, and in 2006 he was awarded the Cannes Film Festival's lifetime achievement award, the Carrosse d'Or. Two of his films, Dead Ringers and Spider, were voted for in the 2002 Sight and Sound Poll. In 2004, Science Fiction magazine Strange Horizons named him the 2nd greatest director in the history of the genre, ahead of better known directors such as Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Jean-Luc Godard and Ridley Scott. In the same year, The Guardian listed him 9th on their list of "The world's 40 best directors". In addition, in 2007, Total Film named him as the 17th greatest director of all-time. In 2006, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, the senior national body of distinguished Canadian scientists and scholars.
David Cronenberg was invited to the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland, to teach an Intensive Summer Workshop.

=======================================================
From All Movie Guide: David Cronenberg sprang into public consciousness with a series of low-budget horror films that shocked and surprised audiences for their sheer audacity and intelligence. Unlike the former two filmmakers, Cronenberg has been able to avoid being pigeonholed into a single restrictive genre category. His works, which consistently explore the same themes, have the mark of a true auteur in the strictest sense of the word. Cronenberg's films have the unnerving ability to delve into society's collective unconscious and dredge up all of the perverse, suppressed desires of modern life. His world features grotesque deformities, hallucinatory couplings, and carnality unhinged from its corporeal moorings.Born on March 15, 1943, in Toronto, Canada, Cronenberg was the son of a freelance journalist and a piano teacher. He was raised in a nurturing middle class family and wrote constantly as a child, showing a strong interest in science, particularly in botany and lepidopterology (the study of moths). In 1963, he entered the University of Toronto as an Honors Science student, though he quickly grew disenchanted and within a year switched to the Honors English Language and Literature program. During this time, Cronenberg was profoundly impressed by Winter Kept Us Warm (1966) by classmate David Secter. Though previously not especially interested in film, this student work piqued his interest, and soon he was hanging out at film camera rental houses where he taught himself the ins and outs of filmmaking. He made two no-budget 16mm films (<I>Transfer</I> and <I>From the Drain</I>), and -- inspired by the underground film scene in New York -- he founded the Toronto Film Co-op with Iain Ewing and Ivan Reitman. After a year traveling in Europe, Cronenberg returned to Canada and graduated at the top of his class in 1967.After making the avant-garde sci-fi flick Stereo (1969), Cronenberg became one of the first recipients of CFDC (Canadian Film Development Corporation) funding for his follow-up, Crimes of the Future (also 1969), a dark, surreal experimental exploration of sexuality. After these two films, Cronenberg realized that working in a strictly experimental venue was ultimately a dead end -- he wanted to broaden his audience.With Reitman as the producer, Cronenberg made his feature debut with the low-budget horror flick Shivers (1975). Recalling Night of the Living Dead (1968) and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), Shivers gleefully presents the audience with phallus-like parasites that turn an apartment full of well-to-do professionals into a throng of sex-mad maniacs. Shivers sharply divided critics. Cronenberg made two more films with direct or indirect funding from the CFDC -- Rabid (1977) and The Brood (1979). Both of these films, along with Shivers, form a rough trilogy of sorts about physical evolutions of the body bringing civilization to its knees. In Rabid, featuring Ivory Pure model-turned-porn star Marilyn Chambers as Typhoid Mary, a virulent strain of rabies that reduces victims to foaming murderous animals devastates the city of Montreal. In The Brood, a mother manifests her angers as bloodthirsty, hideously misshapen children.Cronenberg's breakthrough film was his 1981 box office hit Scanners. Featuring an overtly sci-fi story line, a sinister performance by Michael Ironside, and an infamous exploding head scene, the film established Cronenberg's name beyond the exploitation house and drive-in audiences. Two years later, Cronenberg followed this up with his masterful Videodrome. Told in a Burroughs-esque fractured stream of consciousness, the film concerns Renn, a sleazy cable TV operator, who discovers that the mysterious snuff cable he happened upon gives the viewers brain tumors. Humans and media hardware merge in unexpected, strangely sexual ways: video tapes throb like organs, and a tape is slotted into a vagina like gash in a human abdomen. Though Videodrome's awe of video may seem dated, the film's basic questioning of technology seems perhaps more relevant today than it did when it first premiered. After mining his own personal nightmare, Cronenberg opted for comparatively lighter fare and directed The Dead Zone (1983), adapted from a Stephan King novel. Though this was the first and thus far only script that he did not have a hand in writing, the film's emphasis on off-kilter psychologies and disease bears Cronenberg's unmistakable stamp. Eventually, Cronenberg agreed to remake the 1958 horror classic The Fly (1986). Both a wild gore-fest and a brilliant metaphor for aging, Cronenberg's <I>Fly</I> is a more harrowing and emotionally powerful work than the original. The film also recalled the intensity and intimacy of his early horror works such as The Brood. Consisting of only three main characters and basically one setting, the film obsessively depicts the lead character's slow and gruesome mutation, complete with dropped-off body parts, into a human-fly hybrid. The film proved to a terrific critical and financial success. With his directing reputation cemented, Cronenberg edged away from horror/sci-fi genres and made the chilling character study Dead Ringers (1988). Based on a National Enquirer headline about the real-life case of the Marcus brothers, a pair of fratricidal identical twin gynecologists, the film clinically portrays the duo as their identities slowly disintegrate and merge.Cronenberg followed up Dead Ringers with the decidedly less commercial Naked Lunch (1991). Less an adaptation of William S. Burroughs' classic underground novel than a dizzying meditation on the act of writing, the film features some of Cronenberg's most striking images articulating some of his most familiar themes. Talking cockroaches morph into typewriter-like organisms, women suddenly split open and become men, and typewriters possess flesh-like qualities and evolve into undefined sexual organs. His next work, M. Butterfly (1993), is a restrained account of the bizarre true life case of Rene Gallimard, a French embassy worker who never realized that his long-time Chinese lover was in fact a man.Cronenberg followed M. Butterfly with Crash (1996), his most controversial work to date, based on the profoundly disturbing underground classic by J. D. Ballard. Banned for a time in Britain and rated NC-17 in the U.S., the film is a hypnotic, harrowing journey through a landscape of aberrant sexuality, sterile modernist architecture, emotional blankness, and smashed automobiles. Just as in Ballard's work, Cronenberg takes the familiar cliches of romance and seduction and supplants them with something alien and surreal. James Ballard, the protagonist, engages in an adulterous affair not after a chance meeting, but after a car wreck. The same character penetrates the wound in a severely injured woman's leg instead of using more traditional orifices. Daring and frightening, Crash won a Special Jury Prize at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival.For his 1999 film eXistenZ, he wrote his first original script since Videodrome. Inspired by the fugitive life of author Salman Rushdie, whom Cronenberg interviewed for a magazine, the film concerns a game's designer on the run from a band of Luddite terrorists. Cronenberg brilliantly reverses all Blade Runner-like cliches of the coming cyberpunk future by setting the film in a rustic mountain forest where old fish canneries serve as biotech factories. Fans who were left thirsting for more following the innovative cyberpunk exploits of eXistenZ faced an extended dry spell in the following three years, left with little more than an introspective and fascinating six-minute short entitled Camera that proved a study in celluliods relationship with ageing and death. Though his involvement with the planned sequel to Basic Instinct may not quite have been the film fans had hoped for, plans quickly fell through and Cronenberg began to express interest in author Patrick McGrath's book {-Spider}. A haunting study in mental decay, the material seemed ideally suited to Cronenberg's dark outlook, and it wasn't long before McGrath was adapting his novel into a screenplay for the eager director. Recieving generally high marks from critics upon its limited stateside release in early 2003, the film nevertheless proved a hard sell due to its brooding and deliberate pacing.In the years that followed, Cronenberg moved into genres he hadn't yet charted - with tremendous critical and commercial success across the board. This exploration began in 2005, with The End of Violence - a tough crime thriller with Viggo Mortensen as a man living an unassuming life in Central Indiana, whose dark criminal past explosively catches up with him. Two years later, Cronenberg and Mortensen reunited for the arthouse hit Eastern Promises (2007), with Mortensen as a Russian mafia kingpin living and operating in London; it received glowing reviews and earned considerable box office. Then, in 2011, Cronenberg emerged with a picture in yet another genre: historical drama. His A Dangerous Method co-starred Mortensen, Michael Fassbender and Keira Knightley in the tale of psychoanalyst Sabina Spielrein and her complex relationships with Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. In 2012 he adapted Don DeLillo's Cosmopolis, casting Robert Pattinson as a wealthy young New Yorker having a very hard time getting across town. ~ Jonathan Crow, Rovi

Born in Toronto, Ontario, David Cronenberg began writing gory short stories at an early age. He was fascinated by things like "watching praying mantises eating grasshoppers," and felt that his inclination towards gore set him apart from other youngsters. He studied science at the University of Toronto, switching later to literature. When a college friend made a short film, Cronenberg was "stunned, shocked and exhilarated" by the medium, and said to himself, "I've got to try this!" He made two short films, and in order to get funding from the Canada Council for a feature length film, pretended to be writing a novel. Money in hand, he made Stereo (1969), set at the fictitious Canadian Academy for Erotic Inquiry, followed by Crimes of the Future (1970), in which a dermatologist creates a condition that makes its victims indulge in bizarre fetishes and acts of homosexuality.
Cronenberg next moved to television, where he directed a number of documentaries, mostly featuring Toronto locales. The work earned him credibility as a director and put some money in his pockets. He went on to make another horror film, the gore-filled Shivers (1975), made for a Montreal soft-core porn outfit. "Sleazy distributors," Cronenberg said, when describing the company, "My kind of people." Government money paid for a portion of the film's budget, sparking outrage, including an article in Saturday Night magazine entitled "You Should Know How Bad This Film Is. After All, You Paid For It."
Rabid (1977) involved the adventures of a woman who, after having surgery to save her life following an accident, develops a taste for blood. Cronenberg's work as a director began to be noticed in his native Canada with Scanners (1981), which featured an international cast. The film, about people who control and torture other people with their minds, earned him Genie nominations (CanadaÃ¢â¬â¢s equivalent to the Oscars) for Best Direction and Best Screenplay.
In 1984, Cronenberg won a Genie award for directing the feature Videodrome (1983), about a sexually violent TV channel that alters viewers physically and mentally. In 1989, Cronenberg was again awarded with Genies for his work on Dead Ringers (1988), and in 1992, for his work as a director on the feature Naked Lunch(1991). In 1996, the feature Crash(1996), about people who become erotically charged by car crashes, won the Jury Special Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. He has continued on with more films, gaining international attention for eXistenZ (1999); and more recently, Spider (2003), starring Ralph Fiennes; A Dangerous Method (2012) with Keira Knightley, Viggo Mortensen, and Michael Fassbender; and Cosmopolis (2012) starring Sarah Gadon, Jay Baruchel and Twilight hunk Robert Pattinson.
His daughter, Cassandra, got her start as an assistant director on her father's films, and his sister, Denise, designs the costumes for most of Cronenberg's work. He also has a daughter named Caitlin. Cronenberg lives in Toronto with his wife and enjoys attending Blue Jays baseball games.

Although he's largely left the genre behind, Canadian David Cronenberg remains one of the most critically acclaimed horror directors of all time. His horror films are bold, unsettling and often controversial, yet ultimately trendsetting. They tend to feature art house surrealism and overt sexuality amidst acts of shocking violence.They Came From Within:After directing a series of shorts in the '60s and early '70s, Cronenberg finally received funding from the Canadian government for his feature-film debut in 1975. Shivers established themes that would dominate his early work -- specifically that of so-called "body horror," which derives terror from a mutation or disease within a person's body. Shivers, released in the US as They Came From Within, plays out like a warped version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers -- except that the culprit isn't an alien invasion but rather a mutated venereal disease that both makes people sexually promiscuous and drives them insane. Cronenberg's 1977 follow-up, Rabid, followed closely in Shivers' footsteps. It's more of a zombie movie than a Body Snatchers-styled invasion, but once again, the director instills his fascination with contagions, sex and bodies gone awry. In this case, the sexual imagery comes from porn star Marilyn Chambers, who stars as Rose, a woman who develops a seemingly vaginal opening in her armpit from which protrudes a phallus that she uses to feed on the blood of her victims. Her inherent sexuality attracts victims, who don't die, but rather turn into rabid, flesh-eating zombies. Building off the success of his first two films in both Canada and the US, Cronenberg enjoyed increasing budgets for his next three Canadian horror efforts. And of course, he continued his body horror motif throughout all of them. The first, 1979's The Brood, which involves humans learning to manifest their emotions into physical transformations, including a brood of demonic children birthed out of one woman's emotional pain. Scanners (1981) seems downright normal by comparison, revolving around a group of telekinetic and telepathic people who can -- sometimes to their dismay -- read minds and inflict damage on people through the power of thought (see the infamous exploding head scene). Videodrome (1983) then returned to more abstract concept with the story of a television signal that causes tumors to grow in viewers' bodies, generating hallucinations of body morphing that eventually become reality. Mainstream Breakthrough:The critical and commercial feedback for Cronenberg's early wave of films was so impressive that Hollywood came calling in 1983. The director was recruited to direct the latest in a line of Stephen King adaptations, this time for the psychic mystery tale The Dead Zone. Working for the first time from a script that he didn't write, Cronenberg came through with flying colors, despite stepping out of his comfort zone of body morphing themes. For his next Hollywood effort, though, he found a story that fell squarely into his body horror realm: the Vincent Price classic The Fly. In retelling the tale of a scientist who inadvertently splices his genes with that of a housefly, Cronenberg focuses on the gradual, grisly metamorphosis -- thanks to Oscar-winning makeup -- that Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) undergoes as he loses his humanity and becomes increasingly insect-like. Since The Fly, Cronenberg has focused his directorial efforts on less body-conscious (and more psychological) thrillers that have only tangential horror elements -- such as Dead Ringers (1988), eXistenZ (1999) and Spider (2002). His participation in outright horror since the '90s has actually come from acting in films like Jason X and Clive Barker's Nightbreed. Still, even if he never directs another horror movie, Cronenberg's place in history as a horror innovator and auteur is set in stone. Select Horror Filmography:
