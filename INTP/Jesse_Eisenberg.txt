Jesse Adam Eisenberg (born October 5, 1983) is an American actor and playwright. He made his screen debut with the comedy-drama television series Get Real (1999–2002). After his first leading role, in the film Roger Dodger (2002), he appeared in the movies The Emperor's Club (2002), The Squid and the Whale (2005), The Living Wake (2007) and The Education of Charlie Banks (2007).
In 2007, Eisenberg was honored with the Vail Film Festival Rising Star Award for his role as Mills Joquin in The Living Wake.[1] In 2009, he starred in the comedy drama Adventureland and the horror comedy Zombieland, for which he won critical acclaim. He then played Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network (2010), for which he received a Golden Globe and Academy Award nomination in the Best Actor category. He also starred in Holy Rollers (2010), which was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. Since then, he has voiced the main character, Blu, in the animated films Rio (2011) and Rio 2 (2014), and starred in the comedy 30 Minutes or Less (2011) and the caper film Now You See Me (2013). He will reunite with Kristen Stewart in the upcoming action-comedy film American Ultra which filming begins in April 2014. He will portray Superman villain Lex Luthor opposite Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which will be released in 2016.[2]
Eisenberg was born in Queens, New York, and grew up there and East Brunswick Township, New Jersey. His mother, Amy (née Fishman), worked as a clown at adult parties, and his father, Barry Eisenberg, worked at a hospital and later became a college professor.[3][4] He has two sisters, Hallie Kate Eisenberg, a former child actress who was once famous as the "Pepsi girl" in a series of commercials, and Kerri.[5] He was raised in a secular Jewish family[6] that originated in Poland and Ukraine.[7][8] He attended the East Brunswick Public Schools at Frost School, Hammarskjold Middle School, Churchill Junior High School; he spent his sophomore year at East Brunswick High School.[9]
Eisenberg struggled to fit in at school and began acting in plays at the age of 10. He stated, "When playing a role, I would feel more comfortable, as you're given a prescribed way of behaving."[10] After graduating from high school, he studied anthropology at The New School in Greenwich Village, New York City. Originally, he had applied and was accepted to New York University, but declined enrollment in order to complete a film role.[11][12] Eisenberg made his first professional role in Arje Shaw's off-Broadway play, The Gathering and as an understudy in his Broadway debut and a 1996 revival of Summer and Smoke.
Eisenberg made his debut role in the television series Get Real, from 1999 to 2000. In 2001, he appeared in a Dr. Pepper commercial in the UK. After appearing in the made-for-television film Lightning: Fire from the Sky, he starred in the independent film Roger Dodger (for which he won an award at the San Diego film festival), and in The Emperor's Club, both of which were released in 2002 to generally positive reviews.
In 2005, Eisenberg appeared in Cursed, a horror film directed by Wes Craven, and The Squid and the Whale, a well-reviewed independent drama also starring Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels.[11] In 2007, he starred opposite Richard Gere and Terrence Howard in The Hunting Party, a comic thriller in which he plays a young journalist in Bosnia. In 2009, Eisenberg played the lead role in Adventureland, a comedy directed by Greg Mottola and filmed in Kennywood Park near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Filming ended in October 2007,[13] and the movie premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2009. In November 2007, Eisenberg was cast in the indie comic-drama Holy Rollers. He played a young Hasidic Jew who gets lured into becoming an ecstasy dealer. Filming took place in New York in 2008.[14] During the late 2000s, he also had roles in the independent films Solitary Man, playing Cheston, and Camp Hope, a horror film directed by George Van Buskirk.[15][16]
Eisenberg's breakthrough starring role was as the neurotic Columbus in Zombieland. The horror comedy, which paired him with Woody Harrelson on a roadtrip through a post-zombie apocalypse America, was a surprise hit. In 2010, he starred alongside Andrew Garfield in the role of Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg in the film The Social Network, for which he earned the Best Actor Award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures,[17] and nominations for Best Actor at the Golden Globes and Academy Awards.
On November 22, 2010, Eisenberg was honored, along with Whoopi Goldberg, Joycelyn Engle and Harvey Krueger, at the Children at Heart Celebrity Dinner Gala and Fantasy Auction, to benefit The Children of Chernobyl. Steven Spielberg is Chair of the event each year.[7] On January 29, 2011, Eisenberg hosted Saturday Night Live on NBC, with musical guest Nicki Minaj. During his opening monologue, Eisenberg was joined by Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg.
In 2011, he starred in the box-office animated hit Rio, as the main character Blu, a Spix's Macaw who learns how to fly, starring alongside Anne Hathaway, his former co-star (and onscreen sibling) from Get Real, George Lopez, Jake T. Austin, Tracy Morgan, Jemaine Clement, Leslie Mann, Rodrigo Santoro, will.i.am, and Jamie Foxx. He contributed his singing voice for one of the songs in the soundtrack, "Real in Rio". He also starred in 30 Minutes or Less which was released in August 2011. In October 2011, Eisenberg made his playwriting debut Off-Broadway in Rattlestick Playwrights Theater's production of Asuncion, presented at Cherry Lane Theatre. Eisenberg also acted in the play that was directed by Kip Fagan. The play highlights two liberal-minded friends whose assumptions are challenged by their new Filipina roommate, played by Camille Mana.[18][19]
In 2012, he starred alongside Melissa Leo in Why Stop Now, a drama about a drug addict mother and her piano prodigy son,[20] and in the romantic comedy To Rome with Love. Also in 2012, he filed a $3 million lawsuit claiming he was exploited by the producers of the direct-to-DVD movie, Camp Hell. According to the lawsuit, in 2007 Eisenberg agreed to appear in Camp Hell as a favor to his friends. He was on set for only one day of filming, and logged only a few minutes of total screen time.[21] Because he was only minimally involved in the movie, he was surprised to see that his face was prominently featured on the cover of the DVD, implying that he starred in the film. His lawsuit asserts various California law causes of action, including claims for unfair business practices and publicity rights.[22]
In 2013, Eisenberg reunited with Woody Harrelson for the magician crime thriller Now You See Me. Eisenberg plans to write for stage and screen.[23] He starred in Richard Ayoade's comedy, The Double, which was shot in 2012,[24] and reprised his role as Blu in Rio 2 (2014).[25] In November 2013, it was announced that he will star alongside Kristen Stewart in American Ultra, an action comedy.[26]
On January 31, 2014, Warner Bros. announced that Eisenberg had been cast the main antagonist role as Lex Luthor in the sequel to Man of Steel, set to be released in 2016.[2]
Eisenberg is fond of cats and has been involved in fostering the animals.[27] He is a vegetarian.[28] He has been associated with Farm Sanctuary and has presented at several of their galas.[29] He has also mentioned enjoying riding his bicycle in New York City.
He has previously dated Anna Strout, and is currently reported to be dating actress Mia Wasikowska.[30]
While filming The Hunting Party in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2006, Eisenberg came up with an idea for a simple wordplay website where people could respond to a daily wordplay topic in an attempt to "one-up" each other in the cleverness of their response. He turned to his first cousin, Eric Fisher, who, incidentally, most recently was the Social Design evangelist at Facebook, to create the site, while the userbase is built solely off Facebook.[31]

His first television role came in 1999 with Get Real (1999), but the show was canceled in 2000. In his senior year of high school, he landed his first film role in Roger Dodger (2002). He won an award for "Most Promising New Actor" at the San Diego film festival.Jesse attended the New School University, New York, where he was a liberal arts major, with a focus on Democracy and Cultural Pluralism.His breakthrough role came in Zombieland (2009). In 2010, he was nominated for Best Actor at the Golden Globes and Academy Awards for his role of Facebook's creator, Mark Zuckerberg, in the film, The Social Network (2010).
      His mother is a professional clown who performed at children's birthday parties in their hometown of East Brunswick, N.J. for 20 years.
      Studied at The New School in New York City's Greenwich Village. He applied and was accepted to New York University but declined enrollment to complete a film role.
      Despite his iconic portrayal of Facebook co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, in The Social Network (2010), Jesse himself does not have a Facebook account.
      His character in Zombieland (2009), at one point, expresses relief at not having to update his status on Facebook. Jesse did not know what a Facebook status was until a crew member explained it. The following year, Jesse played Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg.
      Has played two real-life Harvard graduate students - Benjamin Strauss in The Hunting Party (2007) and Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network (2010).
      He is the third Oscar nominated actor to play Lex Luthor after Gene Hackman and Kevin Spacey. He is the only one of the three not to have an Academy Award.
      He is five months younger than Henry Cavill, making him the first actor to play Lex Luthor who is younger than the actor playing Superman.
      This [The Social Network (2010)] was not the sort of script you improvise on. With Aaron Sorkin, it's immediately clear what the rhythm of the scene is. It's similar to reading Shakespeare. In fact, it's a lot like great theater. I looked at some of the lengthier scenes as if I was doing a play. You find the story arc of the scene, discover different moments, build upon them to make it as rich as possible.  reconciled his intense control with his disengagement. He might appear detached and bored, but he's always working to control the entire room.
      [My favorite website] is Geosense.net. It's a geography game. They actually kicked me off for writing "Sri Lanka" on their message boards. I guess it's a curse word on there?
      [on his future projects]: I'm hoping to do several [sequels to] Rio (2011) - Rios 2 through 10. You know, this movie is so wonderful, and we were wondering where the story might go, because this is the same company that did Ice Age (2002), and we suspected it may have some odd sequels.
      [Interview with Stephen Whitty, August, 2011] I have a lot of personal anxieties. And I've realized that playing a character stuck in a life-or-death situation like this allows me to release those anxieties in a very healthful, cathartic way.
      I was mugged one night in New York and slammed into a concrete pillar, and I did an interview where I said I completely understand why they attacked me. It was a poor, black neighborhood. Someone sent me an article saying: 'You ignorant idiot. It's more offensive to defend these people. It's more racist to defend them.' He's right, and that is the impetus for the first scene.
      There's something strange about theater. My characters consistently demonize elitism, but of course it's taking place in a theater where only so many people can see it. I've been in silly popcorn movies - the kind of thing that as an actor you might feel embarrassed about - but those movies reach many more people. In a play you're basically performing for rich people.

From All Movie Guide: Born in Queens and raised in New Jersey, actor Jesse Eisenberg first made an impression on filmgoers as an awkward teen whose uncle leads him on a lusty tour of Manhattan in director Dylan Kidd's award-winning indie Roger Dodger. Though Eisenberg had previously appeared on the Fox drama Get Real and as a storm-chasing teen in the made-for-television drama Lightning: Fire from the Sky, it was Roger Dodger that marked his entrance as a dramatic actor. While subsequent roles in M. Night Shyamalan's The Village and the Wes Craven werewolf fiasco Cursed may have offered Eisenberg little chance to display his dramatic prowess on camera, a more substantial role as a teen whose parents are divorcing in The Squid and the Whale found Eisenberg singled out for praise at both The Gotham Awards and The Independent Spirit Awards. The following years would see Eisenberg climbing the rungs in smaller films like The Education of Charlie Banks, The Hunting Party, and Boys Don't Leave, but his breakthrough came in 2009 with a leading role opposite Kristen Stewart in the period comedy-drama Adventureland. He would soon follow this critically acclaimed hit with a movie that impressed critics and audiences alike, the 2010 horror-comedy Zombieland, in which the actor played the unlikely survivor of a zombie apocalypse. Fast becomming a household name, Eisenberg found an even better vehicle for his talents playing the leading role in the 2010 Oscar contender The Social Network. Playing real life Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Eisenberg was nominated for a host of awards, including an Oscar and a Golden Globe. The following year, the actor signed on to play another character based on a real person, this time with the bizarre comedy 30 Minutes or Less, about a pizza delivery guy forced to commit a bank robbery. He voiced the lead role in the animated film Rio, and in 2012 had a brief turn in the indie comedy Free Samples. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi

Jesse Eisenberg was born in New York City and raised in Queens and New Jersey. He attended the Frost and Hammarskjold schools in East Brunswick, New Jersey, and spent a year at East Brunswick High School before switching to a performing arts school in New York. He did children's theater while growing up as a way to avoid going to school, and landed a role in the film Roger Dodger (2002) in his senior year of high school. Eisenberg doubts he would have chosen to pursue an acting career had he not done that film, saying, "I don't think I am brave enough to pursue something so unpredictable, but I got lucky and decided to try and capitalize on it." He studies liberal arts at the New School University, focusing on Democracy and Cultural Pluralism. 
Eisenberg quickly became a busy film actor. He starred in The Education of Charlie Banks (2007) and appeared in films such as The Hunting Party (2007), One Day Like Rain (2007), and M. Night Shyamalan's The Village (2004). He received rave reviews for his portrayal of Walt Berkman in the independent film The Squid and the Whale (2005) and was nominated in 2006 for the Independent Spirit Best Supporting Actor award and the Broadcast Film Critics' Best Young Actor Award. The roles just kept pouring in for Eisenberg. But in 2010, he landed a part that arguably marked his career. He played the iconic role of Mark Zuckerberg, the creator of Facebook, in The Social Network. The role earned him his first Oscar nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role. Following The Social Network, Eisenberg starred in the comedy 30 Minutes or Less (2011) followed by Woody Allen's To Rome With Love (2012). He recently lent his voice for the animated film Rio 2 (2014). 
He is interested in world politics, having traveled in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. Eisenberg is also interested in writing plays, has played the drums since he was a young child, and created OneUpMe.com, the retired wordplay website.
