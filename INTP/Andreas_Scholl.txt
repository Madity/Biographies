=======================================================
Andreas Scholl (born 10 November 1967) is a German countertenor, a male classical singer in the alto vocal range, specialising in Baroque music.
Born into a family of singers, Scholl was enrolled at the age of seven into the boys choir. Aged 13, he was chosen from 20,000 choristers gathered in Rome from around the world to sing solo at a Mass held on 4 January 1981. Just four years later, Scholl was offered a place at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, an institution that normally accepts only post-graduate students, based on the strength and quality of his voice. He has since become an instructor at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, succeeding his own teacher, Richard Levitt.
Scholl's early operatic roles include his standing in for René Jacobs in 1993 at the Théâtre Grévin in Paris, where he caused a sensation. His major roles, such as his debut at Glyndebourne in 1998 as Bertarido in Handel's Rodelinda, a role he reprised at the Metropolitan Opera in 2006, were written for the 18th-century alto castrato Senesino.
The bulk of Scholl's recording career has been with Harmonia Mundi and Decca, and his CDs are among Harmonia Mundi's best sellers. He has worked with most contemporary Baroque specialists, including William Christie and Philippe Herreweghe, and is himself a song writer and composer of ballet and theatre music, with his own professional sound studio in Basel, Switzerland.
Scholl was born on 10 November 1967 in Eltville, Germany, and grew up in neighbouring Kiedrich.[1][2] His entire family were singers, and he was enrolled at the age of seven into the boys choir Kiedricher Chorbuben, first documented in 1333 as "a schola of men assisting the priests on all Sundays, singing the Gregorian chant". Aged 13, Scholl performed the role of the "second boy" in Mozart's Die Zauberflöte at the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden, while his sister Elisabeth sang the first boy. That same year he was one of 20,000 choristers from all over the world gathered in Rome for a festival, and was chosen to sing solo at Mass on 4 January 1981, where he met Pope John Paul II. Along with his fellow choristers of the Kiedricher Chorbuben, Scholl was an extra in the film The Name of the Rose, playing a young monk standing alongside Sean Connery in scenes shot at Eberbach Abbey, near Kiedrich.
Scholl was 17 when the extent of his ability was recognised by the voice coach of the Chorbuben from the Darmstadt Music Academy.[2] Scholl then sang for the tenor/countertenor Herbert Klein, who advised him that there were only two places he should study: in London or at the early music conservatoire in Basel, the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis. Since an uncle had introduced Scholl to the voices of Paul Esswood and James Bowman, the leading European countertenors of the day, Scholl chose Bowman as a role model. Scholl sent a demo tape to René Jacobs to evaluate his talent. This resulted in Jacobs inviting Scholl to visit the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis. Although the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis only offered post-graduate courses, and Scholl had no first degree, he was offered a place on the strength and quality of his voice after singing a Schubert song for the admissions board, which included René Jacobs.
At the Schola, Andreas Scholl's teacher was Richard Levitt, followed by Jacobs in his second year.[3] Violinist Chiara Banchini and soprano Emma Kirkby were major influences, as Scholl began to specialise in the music of the Baroque. Scholl additionally studied with soprano Evelyn Tubb and lutenist Anthony Rooley. In addition to the Diploma of Ancient Music, for which his external examiner was James Bowman, Andreas Scholl garnered prizes from the Council of Europe and the Claude Nicolas Ledoux Foundation, and awards from Switzerland's Association Migros and Ernst Göhner Foundation.
Andreas Scholl has been teaching interpretation in the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, succeeding his own teacher, Richard Levitt, and is in much demand for master classes.
In 1988 Scholl performed Bach's Christmas Oratorio in Rüdesheim. In 1991 he appeared in Bach's St John Passion, conducted by Philippe Herreweghe in Antwerp.[3] In January 1993 Scholl stood in for René Jacobs at Jacobs' request at the Théâtre Grévin (fr) in Paris, causing a sensation. Scholl's partner that night was the harpsichordist Markus Märkl (de), who became his constant musical counterpart in the following years. A later performance of Bach's St John Passion was broadcast on Good Friday to a radio audience which included William Christie. Shortly thereafter, Christie and Scholl met on a train. The 1994 recording of Handel's Messiah with Les Arts Florissants resulted directly from this meeting.
Scholl performed Bach's Mass in B minor in 1995, conducted by Jacobs, and sang works by Purcell on a tour in France.[3] In 1998 Scholl and his sister performed in Bach's St Matthew Passion, with Max Ciolek as the Evangelist and Max van Egmond as the vox Christi, in St. Martin, Idstein.[4] Scholl performed the title role of Handel's Solomon at The Proms. He gave recitals in Wigmore Hall and at the Brighton Festival.[3]
Scholl's major operatic roles were written for the 18th-century alto castrato Senesino. They include his debut at Glyndebourne in 1998, performing the part of Bertarido in Handel's Rodelinda opposite Anna Caterina Antonacci in the title role, repeated in 1999 and 2002.[5] Rodelinda was a huge success and Scholl "stopped the show" according to the Sunday Times. James Bowman, who describes himself as an unqualified admirer, reported that "people went into a kind of trance" when he sang Dove Sei. The Financial Times said of his Vivi tiranno: "such intelligent virtuosity ... time stands still and you feel he is speaking to you." In February 2002, Le Monde called him "Le Roi Scholl" after his reprise of the role of Bertarido in the Paris production of the Glyndebourne Rodelinda.
Scholl performed this role also at the Metropolitan Opera in 2006, opposite Renée Fleming in the title role and Kobie van Rensburg, conducted by Patrick Summers, repeated in 2011.[6] He performed the title role in Handel's Giulio Cesare in a Royal Danish Opera production in 2002 and 2005), reprised in Paris (2007) and Lausanne (2008).[5] In 2008 he performed the role of Arsace in Handel's Partenope for the Royal Danish Opera. In 2010 he sang Giulio Cesare, this time opposite Cecilia Bartoli as Cleopatra, with Les Arts Florissants conducted by Christie.[5]
In 1999, Scholl appeared with the Netherlands Bach Society, conducted by Jos van Veldhoven in works of Bach, including his Missa in G (BWV 236). He performed Bach's Christmas Oratorio in Avery Fisher Hall, conducted by Ton Koopman. In 2000 he gave several concerts of Bach's Mass in B minor in Japan, conducted by Masaaki Suzuki. In 2001, Scholl sang in Handel's Saul in Brussels and performed the title role in Handel's Solomon, conducted by Paul McCreesh. He sang Bach's St John Passion in the Thomaskirche, Leipzig.[5] At the Bachfest Leipzig 2003, he sang in the Mass in B minor, which traditionally closes the festival, with Letizia Scherrer, Mark Padmore and Sebastian Noack, choir and orchestra of the Collegium Vocale Gent, conducted by Herreweghe.[7] In 2006 he sang on a tour of Europa Bach's solo cantatas Vergnügte Ruh, beliebte Seelenlust, BWV 170, and Geist und Seele wird verwirret, BWV 35, with the orchestra Accademia Bizantina. In 2007 he performed the title role of Saul again, at Eberbach Abbey with Trine Wilsberg Lund (Merab), Hannah Morrison (Michal), Andreas Karasiak (Jonathan) and the Schiersteiner Kantorei, conducted by Martin Lutz. In the Berliner Philharmonie he sang Handel's Messiah with soloists of the Tölzer Knabenchor, the choir of Les Arts Florissants and the Berlin Philharmonic, conducted by Christie.[5] In 2008 Andres Scholl made his debut with the New York Philharmonic, singing Handel's Messiah in Avery Fisher Hall, conducted by Ton Koopman.[8]
Andreas Scholl and members of the Baroque orchestra Accademia Bizantina in a concert of the Rheingau Musik Festival at the church of Hallgarten, 16 July 2011
In 2011 Scholl made his debut at the Rheingau Musik Festival in three events, an interview, a trip to three churches with different concert programs, and an opera recital with his sister Elisabeth at Eberbach Abbey. In the Christophoruskirche of Wiesbaden-Schierstein he appeared with harpsichordist Tamar Halperin, in Hallgarten with members of the Accademia Bizantina, in the romanesque Basilika St. Aegidius of Mittelheim with the vocal trio White Raven. The opera recital with the chamber orchestra Accademia Bizantina contained works of Handel and Purcell, such as Handel's Rodelinda, Purcell's King Arthur, closing with the final love duet "Caro! Bella!" from Giulio Cesare in Egitto.[9] In 2011 he performed the alto part of Handel's Messiah in St. Martin, Idstein, with Katia Plaschka, Ulrich Cordes and Markus Flaig.[10] A review describes his perfect timing in the recitatives, his pronounced declamation, technically perfect interpretation and phrasing of the arias, and his devotion to Handel's music and Jennens's text.[11] The Air "He was despised" was regarded as the artistic high point of the concert.[10] In 2013 he performed Bach cantatas BWV 82 and BWV 169 with the Kammerorchester Basel.[12] He appeared with the vocal ensemble Profeti della Quinta and lutenist Edin Karamazov.
Andreas Scholl has worked with most contemporary Baroque specialists, including Christophe Coin, Michel Corboz, Paul Dyer, John Eliot Gardiner, Reinhard Goebel, Christopher Hogwood, Robert King, Nicholas McGegan, Roger Norrington, Christophe Rousset, Dominique Veillard and Roland Wilson. He took part in the project of Ton Koopman and the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra & Choir to record the complete vocal works of Bach. His regular solo partners include cembalist Markus Märkl and the virtuoso lutenist Edin Karamazov. He performed as a member of Konrad Junghänel's Cantus Cölln, and has collaborated with ensembles such as the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, Musica Antiqua Köln, the Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin, the Freiburger Barockorchester, the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra and Accademia Bizantina.
The composer Marco Rosano has created a new Stabat Mater for Andreas Scholl; he sang the first complete performance of this work on 22 February 2008 at the City Recital Hall, Angel Place, Sydney, accompanied by the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra under Paul Dyer.
Scholl has always composed songs, as well as music for ballet and theatre, and has his own professional sound studio in Basel, Switzerland. His song White as Lilies, based on ideas of John Dowland, is on the 1995 CD The Countertenors (with Dominique Visse and Pascal Bertin). It was a hit in Korea when used in a TV commercial and was later released there in an orchestrated version. In December 2003, he gave his first public performance in popular music, an eclectic programme of electronic and orchestral works which included his own compositions. Alongside Scholl was fellow Baroque countertenor, Roland Kunz, who specialises in setting Elizabethan English poems to his own electronic music. The two countertenors duetted in Scholl's and Kunz's songs, backed by Kunz's band die Unerlösten and the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Saarbrücken under Rick Stengårds. In 2013 he collaborated with Idan Raichel in his album Quarter to Six.
The bulk of Scholl's recording career has been with Harmonia Mundi and Decca. By 1998 his CDs dominated Harmonia Mundi's hit list at numbers one, three, four, five and ten, and they are still among Harmonia Mundi's best sellers. His discography amounts to more than sixty CDs, all but two being music of the European Baroque or Renaissance. Recordings in which he has collaborated, including all but one of his solo recordings, have won awards. His personal accolades include the Diapason d'Or, multiple Gramophone Awards, 10 de Repertoire, ffff Telerama and Choc du Mond de la Musique, the ECHO award and Prix de l'Union de la Presse Musicale Belge. In an extremely rare departure from its normally austere approach, Fanfare magazine described his recording of Dowland's A Musicall Banquet as "perfect". The recording of Bach's St John Passion conducted by Philippe Herreweghe on which Andreas Scholl sings was nominated for a Cannes Classical Award in 2003. He was Germany's Kultur Radio Artist of the Year in 1998. He has revealed, to German audiences in particular, some little-known masterworks of German Baroque composers and has thereby made a significant contribution to the modern rediscovery of the Baroque repertoire. His 2001 album of folk songs, Wayfaring Stranger, was a personal project, well received by the CD-buying public but not universally acclaimed by his fellow musicians, some of whom regarded it as an inappropriate departure from his more classical work.

The German counter-tenor, Andreas Scholl, was born in Eltville-am-Rhein, and grew up in the neighbouring village of Kiedrich im Rheingau near Wiesbaden. There he was a member of the 600-year old Kiedricher Chorbuben, along with several members of his family including his sister, the soprano Elisabeth Scholl. He first sang the music of J S Bach at the age of seven. The children learnt ‘by ear’ and Scholl did not begin to read music until his late teens. Aged thirteen, he was selected from 20,000 choristers at a Rome festival to sing solo in St Peter’s Basilica before Pope John Paul 11. At seventeen he was still singing soprano, having ‘sung through the break’, although his speaking voice had by then long been baritone. He was identified as a countertenor by the Chorbuben's voice coach who sent him to tenor/countertenor Herbert Klein. Klein advised him that he should study in London or at Basel’s Schola Cantorum Basiliensis which, until then, had never accepted undergraduates. Scholl was auditioned and accepted on the recommendation of René Jacobs, then teaching at the Schola. He obtained his Diploma in Ancient Music six years later having studied with Richard Levitt and taken specialist classes with René Jacobs, Emma Kirkby, Anthony Rooley, Evelyn Tubb and Chiara Banchini among others. James Bowman was his external examiner for graduation. He received awards from the Conseil d'Europe, the Fondation Claude Nicolas Ledoux, the Association Migros and the Ernst Göhner Foundation.
The partnership between Harmonia Mundi France and the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis to document previously unrecorded early music resulted in a series of recordings directed by René Jacobs in which Andreas Scholl participated. They include Antonio Vivaldi’s Stabat Mater and Antonio Caldara’s Maddalena ai Piedi di Cristo both of which received multiple awards and achieved lasting commercial success, although it was William Christie’s 1994 HM recording of George Frideric Handel’s Messiah which launched Scholl as a major artist. By 1998, he dominated Harmonia Mundi's sales with CDs at numbers one, three, four, five and ten in their inventory, recordings which remain among their best sellers. In 1999 Andreas Scholl signed with Decca, the contract being renewed in 2004. For Deutsche Grammophon, he has sung G.F. Handel’s Solomon and David in Saul, under Paul McCreesh. Scholl’s personal accolades include the Diapason d'Or, multiple Gramophone Awards, 10 de Repertoire, ffff Telerama and Choc du Mond de la Musique, the ECHO award and Prix de l'Union de la Presse Musicale Belge. In a unique departure from its customarily austere approach, Fanfare magazine described his recording of Dowland's A Musicall Banquet (2000) as 'perfect'.
Andreas Scholl has sung with conductors Paul Dyer, John Eliot Gardiner, Reinhard Goebel, Christopher Hogwood, Konrad Junghänel, Robert King, Nicholas McGegan, Lars Ulrik Mortensen, Roger Norrington, Christophe Rousset, Jos van Veldhoven, Dominique Vellard and Roland Wilson among others. His regular solo partners include harpsichordist Markus Märkl and lutenist Crawford Young who succeeded Scholl’s long-time lutenist, the late Karl-Ernst Schröder. Ensembles with which he performs include the Nederlandse Bachvereniging, Cantus Cölln, Gabrieli Consort & Players, Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, Musica Antiqua Köln, Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin, Freiburger Barockorchester, Australian Brandenburg Orchestra and, recently, Accademia Bizantina which is now his regular orchestra for recording. Composer Marco Rosano is creating a new Stabat Mater for Andreas Scholl.　In popular music, his hobby, Andreas Scholl works with rock composer and baroque counter-tenor Roland Kunz. He is regularly commissioned to write music for theatre and ballet.
In opera, Andreas Scholl has sung the role of Bertarido in G.F. Handel's Rodelinda (Glyndebourne, 1998, 1999, 2002) and the title role in G.F. Handel's Giulio Cesare in Egitto in the Royal Danish Opera production of 2002 (revived 2005) under Lars Ulrik Mortensen.
Andreas Scholl teaches interpretation in the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, succeeding his own teacher, Richard Levitt. His mantra is 'Lieber erstmal Lieder'. In 2004, he was a judge at Belgium's Queen Elisabeth Concours, and other competitions.
Andreas Scholl has recorded several Bach cantatas including all those written for the solo alto voice, the CD of which remains his most popular, as well as the B Minor Mass (BWV 232), the St John (BWV 245) and St Matthew Passions (BWV 244) (Philippe Herreweghe) and the Weinachts-Oratorium (BWV 248) (René Jacobs). He is invited to teach a mastercourse on Bach cantatas at the Britten-Pears School, England. Johann Sebastian Bach is the composer whose work Scholl finds the most challenging and most rewarding. After recording one of Bach's solo cantatas for alto, he wept. 'The piece was so mighty, I felt like an ant.'　 For Scholl, the Mass in B minor (BWV 232) is the apogee  of J.S. Bach's religious composition; above all, the Agnus Dei, which he believes is the greatest single work written for the counter-tenor voice.
=======================================================
Andreas Scholl has released a series of extraordinary solo recordings: the most recent being Wanderer - a disc of German Lied in partnership with Tamar Halperin.
This season highlights include a residency at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées with a performance of Handel Arias with the Orchestre de Chambre de Paris conducted by Sir Roger Norrington as well as Pergolesi’s Stabat Mater with the Academy of Ancient Music, which will also be performed in Brussels, Birmingham and London. In the Far East he sings his Wanderer programme in recital in Seoul and Tokyo; and he presents an exciting new programme of old and new music which combines Vivaldi’s Stabat Mater and music by Arvo Pärt with the Australian Chamber Orchestra on tour to Sydney and Melbourne.

“It might be a new Golden Age of the countertenor, bur few can equal the sheer beauty of tone and dramatic instinct displayed by Andreas Scholl.” (BBC Music Magazine, February 2012)
“Scholl sang with the refinement and intensity for which he is known. Phrases were perfectly shaped. His tone was pure. For once at a concert presented by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, printed texts were provided and the lights kept on. But this time they weren't needed. Accents and annunciation were as they should be: Each word could be understood and felt. Music of great character was delivered with great character but without great or unneeded exaggeration. Scholl is a model singer." (LA Times, October 2011)
“This concert, its programme a kind of Sampler of what Andreas Scholl’s art is all about, gave as good a reason for thanks as any I can imagine. Sweeter than roses’ was not so much sung as dramatically lived, the phrase ‘made me freeze’ sending shivers down the spine, but even this was overshadowed by a peerless ‘Have you seen the bright lily grow?’ which was a couple of minutes of utter perfection, ‘O so sweet is she’ seeming to linger in the air long after the song had closed.” (Music OMH, June 2011)
“Andreas Scholl’s disc 'Crystal Tears', a darkly entrancing program of music from Elizabethan and Jacobean England, is my candidate for CD of the year. Scholl, a German countertenor with a pure yet full voice, goes uncannily deep into the songs of John Dowland and his contemporaries; the lutenist Julian Behr and the viol consort Concerto di viole provide immaculate, hypnotic accompaniment.” (The Ten Best Classical Music Recordings of 2008, The New Yorker, December 2008)
"In the three Handel solo cantatas - all about the ecstasies and the agonies of love - Scholl was storyteller supreme, daring his audience to stay fully engaged for every compelling second."  (The Times, June 2006)

Although Scholl is one of the foremost singers of Baroque music for countertenor, he has also explored music of other eras for his voice.
