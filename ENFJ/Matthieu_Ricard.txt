Matthieu Ricard (Nepali: माथ्यु रिका born 15 February 1946) is a French Buddhist monk who resides at Shechen Tennyi Dargyeling Monastery in Nepal.
Born in Aix-les-Bains, Savoie, France, he is the son of the late Jean-François Revel (born Jean-François Ricard), a renowned French philosopher. His mother is the lyrical abstractionist painter Yahne Le Toumelin. Matthieu Ricard grew up among the personalities and ideas of French intellectual circles.[1]
He worked for a Ph.D. degree in molecular genetics at the Pasteur Institute under French Nobel Laureate François Jacob. After completing his doctoral thesis in 1972, Ricard decided to forsake his scientific career and concentrate on the practice of Tibetan Buddhism.
He lived in the Himalayas studying with the Kangyur Rinpoche and some other great masters of that tradition and became the close student and attendant of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche until Rinpoche's death in 1991. Since then, Dr. Ricard has dedicated his activities to fulfilling Khyentse Rinpoche’s vision.
Ricard’s photographs of the spiritual masters, the landscape, and the people of the Himalayas have appeared in numerous books and magazines. Henri Cartier-Bresson has said of his work, "Matthieu’s spiritual life and his camera are one, from which springs these images, fleeting and eternal."[citation needed]
He is the author and photographer of Tibet, An Inner Journey and Monk Dancers of Tibet and, in collaboration, the photobooks Buddhist Himalayas, Journey to Enlightenment and Motionless Journey: From a Hermitage in the Himalayas. He is the translator of numerous Buddhist texts, including The Life of Shabkar.
The dialogue with his father, Jean-Francois Revel, The Monk and the Philosopher, was a best seller in Europe and was translated into 21 languages, and The Quantum and the Lotus (coauthored with Trinh Xuan Thuan) reflects his long-standing interest in science and Buddhism. His 2003 book Plaidoyer pour le bonheur (published in English in 2006 as Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill)[2] explores the meaning and fulfillment of happiness and was a major best-seller in France.
He has been dubbed the "happiest person in the world" by popular media.[3][4][5] Matthieu Ricard was a volunteer subject in a study performed at the University of Wisconsin–Madison's on happiness, scoring significantly beyond the average obtained after testing hundreds of volunteers.[4]
He co-authored a study on the brains of long-term meditators, including himself, who had undergone a minimum of three years retreat.[6]
A board member of the Mind and Life Institute, which is devoted to meetings and collaborative research between scientists and Buddhist scholars and meditators, his contributions have appeared in Destructive Emotions (edited by Daniel Goleman) and other books of essays. He is engaged in research on the effect of mind training on the brain, at Madison-Wisconsin, Princeton and Berkeley.
He received the French National Order of Merit for his humanitarian work in the East[vague]. For the last few years,[when?] Dr. Ricard has dedicated his effort and the royalties of his books to various charitable projects in Asia, that include building and maintaining clinics, schools and orphanages in the region. Since 1989, he has acted as the French interpreter for the Dalai Lama.[1]
Ricard has been a speaker at the World Happiness Forum conferences held in Sydney, London, San Francisco and Singapore.[7]

Crowd pressing to receive blessings from the young lama Dilgo Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche (Eastern Tibet, 2010)
    All sentient beings are the same in wishing to be happy and not to suffer. The great difference between oneself and others is in numbers—there is only one of me, but countless others. So, my happiness and my suffering are completely insignificant compared to the happiness and suffering of infinite other beings. What truly matters is whether other beings are happy or suffering. This is the basis of bodhichitta. We should wish others to be happy rather than ourselves, and we should especially wish happiness for those whom we perceive as enemies and those who treat us badly. Otherwise, what is the use of compassion?

 âMatthieu's camera and his spiritual life are one, and from this spring these images, fleeting and eternal." Henri-Cartier Bresson Matthieu Ricard has photographed the spiritual masters, landscapes, and people of the Himalayans over the last forty-five years and published several albums of photography including, in English, Journey to Enlightenment (Aperture, 1996 - The Spirit of Tibet in paperback, Aperture 2001), Buddhist Himalayas (Harry Abrams, 2002), Dancers Monks of Tibet (Shambhala, 2003), Tibet, an Inner Journey (Thames and Hudson, 2006), Motionless Journey (Thames and Hudson, 2007) and Bhutan, a Land of Peace (Thames and Hudson, 2008). His work have been exhibited in New York (RMA Museum, Aperture Gallery, Asia Society), Paris, Perpignan (Visa pour lâimage), Winthertur, Stockholm and Hong Kong and reviewed in the New York Times and other magazines throughout the world. 
Born in France in 1946, Matthieu Ricard did a Ph.D. in cell genetics at the Pasteur Institute under Nobel Laureate FranÃ§ois Jacob and when he was twenty, wrote the widely read book Animal Migrations (Hill and Wang, 1969). Since 1967, he lived in Himalayas to study Tibetan Buddhism and is the French interpreter of the Dalai Lama. 
Matthieu has initiated and supervises thirty humanitarian projects (clinics, schools, erlderly peopleâs home, bridges) in Nepal, Tibet, India and Bhutan. The royalties of his books are entirely donated to such projects (www.karuna-shechen.org) 
He lives in Nepal at Shechen Monastery and devotes much of his time to the preservation of Tibetan cultural heritage. He has set there a unique Archive where 15,000 photographs on Himalayan art have been preserved and are made available to art schools, research centers, scholars and individuals.
He is also the author of several books including The Monk and the Philosopher (Schocken, 1999), a book of dialogues with his father, the late French philosopher Jean-FranÃ§ois Revel, which has been translated into twenty-one languages, The Quantum and the LotusHappiness, A Guide to Developing Lifeâs Most Important Skill (Little Brown, 2006) that remained 20 weeks on the best-seller list in France. As a renown Tibetan scholar, he has translated numerous books from Tibetan into English and French. A board member of the Mind and Life Institute, which is devoted to meetings and collaborative research between brain scientists and Buddhist meditators, his contributions have appeared in Working with Destructive Emotions (edited by Daniel Goleman), The Dalai Lama at M.I.T, and other books of essays.

MATTHIEU RICARD THE HAPPIEST MAN IN THE WORLD? | BIOGRAPHY Matthieu Ricard is officially the “happiest person in the world”. Neuroscientists in the US have declared Ricard, the French translator of the Dalai Lama, to be the happiest man they have ever tested.
 MATTHIEU RICARD   THE HAPPIEST MAN IN THE WORLD  BY TRAINING HIS MIND  WITH AUTHENTIC TIBETAN BOUDDHIST TEACHERS    
 Matthieu Ricard was born in France in 1946. His father, Jean-François Revel was an honored philosopher, writer,   journalist and a member of the noted Académie Française, which is a gathering   of some of the most notorious French   intellectuals. His mother, Yahne Le Toumelin is a painter and watercolorist.     He grew up among the personalities and ideas of Paris’ intellectual and artistic circles. He studied classical music,   ornithology and photography. He counted Luis Buñuel, Igor Stravinsky and Henri Cartier-Bresson among his friends.   He did a Ph.D. in cellular genetics at the Institut Pasteur under Nobel Laureate François Jacob. After completing his Ph.D.   thesis in 1972, Mr. Ricard decided to forsake his scientific career and concentrate on Tibetan Buddhist studies. He spent   40 years meditating in the Himalayas and has done 40,000 hours of meditation.     Matthieu Ricard has lived in the Himalayas since 1972 and has been a Buddhist monk for 37 years at the Shechen   Monastery in Nepal. He has met the greatest living teachers and became the close student and attendant of Dilgo   Khyentse Rinpoche, one of the most eminent Tibetan masters and luminaries of our time, until the death of Rinpoche in   1991.   Since 1989 he has accompanied HH Dalai Lama to France, acting as his personal interpreter.   He has been awarded the French National Order of Merit by President François Mitterrand for his involvement and his   efforts to preserve the Himalayan cultures.    Matthieu Ricard is a bestselling author.   He has translated and edited numerous books on Tibetan Buddhism and is highly praised for his vast knowledge of   Tibetan religion and culture.   He is the author of The Mystery of Animal Migration,Hill & Wang, NY, 1969, The Monk and the Philosopher, Knopf   Publishing Group, 2000, a best-seller book of dialogues with his father Jean-François Revel, which has been translated   into twenty-three languages and on the bestseller booklist in France for nine months.   The Quantum and the Lotus, Crown Publishing Group, 2004, presents an in-depth conversation with the astrophysicist   Trinh Xuan Thuan. According to His Holiness the Dalai Lama, it “is the rich and inspiring result of a deeply interesting   dialogue between Western science and Buddhist philosophy. This remarkable book will contribute greatly to a better   understanding of the true nature of our world and the way we live our lives.”   He has also published The Spirit of Tibet, 2001, (also in video), a photo book on the life of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Monk   Dancers of Tibet, Shambhala Publications, 2003, in collaboration, the photobook, Buddhist Himalayas, Harry N Abrams   Inc, 2002 and numerous translations of Tibetan texts, including The Life of Shabkar, The Autobiography of a Tibetan   Yogin, Snow Lion Publications, 2001 and The Heart Treasure of the Enlightened Ones, The Practice of View, Meditation,   and Action, Boston, Shambhala Publications, 1993.   With Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill, Matthieu Ricard continues to bridge the dialogue   between East and West. Motionless Journey features photographs taken from the hermitage's terrace and   surroundings. His latest books   Matthieu Ricard’s pictures of remarkable spiritual masters, the people of the Himalayas and the landscapes, have   appeared internationally in numerous magazines and books. Henri Cartier-Bresson has said of his work that « Matthieu’s   spiritual life and his camera are one, from which springs these images, fleeting and eternal ». His work has been   exhibited in New York, Paris, Perpignan, Winthertur, Stockholm, and Hong Kong.   Matthieu Ricard has dedicated his efforts to supervise various humanitarian projects. For instance, 110 projects are already   completed in Tibet, Nepal and India, 12 schools built in Tibet and 3 in Nepal, where 5000 children study, 14 clinics and small   dispensaries built in Nepal, India and Tibet,100,000 medical services given every year, 8 bridges built in Tibet, including 3 large   suspension bridges, 3 homes for the ederly. Matthieu Ricard talks about Karuna-Shechen humanitarian projects.   All proceeds from his books go to funding all Shechen’s humanitarian projects in   Tibet, India, Nepal and Bhutan. Each   year 100 000 patients, of which 15 000 children, are being taken care of.   Since 2000, Matthieu Ricard has been an active member of the Mind and Life Institute and participates in current   scientific research on Training the Mind and Brain Plasticity headed by the cognitive scientist Professor Richard J.   Davidson, one of the world's leading investigators in the field of neuroplasticity.   At the University of Wisconsin, researchers attached 256 sensors to his skull and placed him into a functional magnetic   resonance imager (fMRI). Ricard's MRI showed the highest level of activity ever recorded in the left pre-frontal cortex of   the brain, the area associated with positive emotion. With the scoring ranging from +0.3 to -0.3 (beatific) Matthieu   Ricard's scores were actually off the scale at more than -0.45. It was a world first!!!   http://www.pri.org/theworld/node/26303   The paper describing the remarkable results, published in the Proceedings of the US National Academy of Sciences   (PNAS) in 2004, would become a year later the fifth most-downloaded scientific publication in history. So far, this   research has been downloaded more than 150 000 times.  http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/101/46/16369    Matthieu Ricard is engaged in the research on the effect of mind training and meditation on the brain at various   universities: Wisconsin-Madison, Princeton,  Harvard, Berkeley in USA, at Maastricht in the Netherlands, at Zurich in   Switzerland, Hong Kong and Leipzig in Germany.   In 2006, 2009 and 2010 Matthieu Ricard took part to the World Economic Forum in Davos.    He is co-director of the Buddhist Shechen monastery in Nepal.   He dedicates his activities to fulfilling Khyentse Rinpoche’s vision.

															, ..After training in biochemistry at the Institute Pasteur, Matthieu Ricard left science behind to move to the Himalayas and become a Buddhist monk -- and to pursue happiness, both at a basic human level and as a subject of inquiry. Achieving happiness, he has come to believe requires the same kind of effort and mind training that any other serious pursuit involves. His deep and scientifically tinged reflections on happiness and Buddhism have turned into several books, including The Quantum and the Lotus: A Journey to the Frontiers Where Science and Buddhism Meet. His latest book on happiness is Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill; his latest book of photographs is Tibet: An Inner Journey.© Copyright (c) The Vancouver Sun   E-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleShare this Article
