David Drew Pinsky (born September 4, 1958),[2] best known as Dr. Drew, is an American board-certified internist, addiction medicine specialist, and radio and television personality. He has hosted the nationally syndicated radio talk show Loveline since the show's inception in 1984. On television, he hosts the talk show Dr. Drew On Call on HLN, and hosted the canceled daytime series Lifechangers on the The CW. In addition, he serves as producer and starred in the VH1 show Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, and its spinoffs Sex Rehab with Dr. Drew, Celebrity Rehab Presents Sober House and hosts podcasts on the Adam Carolla podcast network.
Pinsky is also Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, former Medical Director for the Department of Chemical Dependency Services at Las Encinas Hospital in Pasadena, California,[3] staff member at Huntington Memorial Hospital, and a private practitioner.[4]
Pinsky was born in Pasadena, California.[5] His father, Morton Pinsky (1925–2009), was a physician whose parents emigrated from Russia.[6] His mother, Helene Stanton (née Eleanor Mae Stansbury; born 1925), is a retired singer and actress who came from a "highly Victorian upper-middle-class family in Philadelphia".[6][7] Pinsky attended Polytechnic School. He majored in biology at Amherst College, graduating in 1980,[5][8] and earned his M.D. at the University of Southern California School of Medicine in 1984.[9] He served his residency in internal medicine at USC County Hospital and became chief resident at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, and eventually moved into private practice.[10]
My goal was always to be part of pop culture and relevant to young people, to interact with the people they hold in high esteem.
As The New York Times described it in February 2008, Pinsky's dual career in medicine and the mass media has required him to "navigat[e] a precarious balance of professionalism and salaciousness."[11]
In 1984, while still a medical student, Pinsky started appearing in "Ask a Surgeon", a segment of a Sunday night KROQ-FM show hosted by Jim "Poorman" Trenton and "Swedish" Egil Aalvik.[12] "Ask the Surgeon" soon combined with "Loveline", another Sunday night segment, into a show of its own, co-hosted by Trenton and Pinsky. Loveline went national in 1995, and the television version launched on MTV the following year, hosted by Pinsky and Adam Carolla. The exposure on both radio and television made Pinsky the "Gen-X answer to Dr. Ruth Westheimer, with an AIDS-era, pro-safe-sex message."[11] The MTV show ran for four years, while the radio show continues on today without Carolla, who left the show in 2005.
On November 27, 2007, Pinsky began Dr. Drew Live, another nationally syndicated talk radio show where he focused on a wider range of health issues. It originated from KGIL in Los Angeles, originally airing weekdays from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm PT[13] The show was canceled in December 2008.
In the December 9, 2003 episode of Loveline with guest co-host Adam Carolla, Pinsky mentioned that he was on Wheel of Fortune in 1984, though he did not win. In the January 2011 episode of Loveline, Pinsky mentioned that he appeared on Wheel of Fortune again. Pinsky made his acting debut in "Terminal," a 1998 episode of the TV show Space Ghost Coast to Coast, and later appeared on Dawson's Creek[14] and Family Guy.[15]
In addition to his own radio show and medical career, Pinsky also has appeared on television talk shows. He served as "health and human relations expert" on the first season of the U.S. TV series Big Brother in 2000. He has also hosted his own television series, Strictly Sex with Dr. Drew, on the Discovery Health Channel, which was followed by Strictly Dr. Drew. The newer program addressed everyday health issues, premiered on July 25, 2006, and continues to air weekly on Tuesdays at 7:00 pm PT.
In 2008, Pinsky starred in Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, a reality television show which involves celebrities in a drug rehabilitation facility. The show was filmed at Pasadena Recovery Center, with Pinsky serving as the resident medical expert. The series premiered January 10, 2008 on VH-1, and has been renewed for multiple seasons. A follow-up show to Celebrity Rehab with many of the same celebrities was Sober House, which began its first season in January 2009, and included celebrities from the first two seasons of Celebrity Rehab continuing their recovery in a sober living facility.[16]
Pinsky also appears on the MTV series Sex...with Mom and Dad. Pinsky makes guest appearances on a variety of news programs where he usually gives his observations on the relationship between controlled substances and high-profile individuals. He has frequently given his views on the deaths of people such as Anna Nicole Smith, Heath Ledger and Michael Jackson, arguing that their fates should set examples of the seriousness of misusing drugs.[17] In November 2009, Pinsky starred in a spinoff of Celebrity Rehab, Sex Rehab with Dr.Drew, which depicted celebrities being treated for sexual addiction over the course of three weeks at the Pasadena Recovery Center.
TV appearances in which Pinsky did not appear as himself include The Adam Carolla Project, Minoriteam,[18] Robot Chicken,[19] My Gym Partner's a Monkey,[20] and Code Monkeys.[21] Pinsky appeared in the films New York Minute and Wild Hogs.
In early 2011, Pinsky began hosting his own show on HLN that focuses on addiction.[22] In an interview on Kevin and Bean, Pinsky has stated he will speak to any media outlet including TMZ and The National Enquirer, but will not speak to the Los Angeles Times, explaining "They distort, and they mislead, and they take things out of context. I really am stunned at how shoddy their journalism is, so I stopped talking to them."[23] In September 2012, Pinsky announced on the The Adam Carolla Show that he will be doing a podcast on the Carolla Digital network.[24]
In 1999, Pinsky co-founded an Internet-based community and advice site for teenagers called DrDrew.com with Curtis Giesen. Among their early backers was Garage.com.[25] DrDrew.com soon ran out of funding, and the company was sold to Sherwood Partners Inc., a corporate restructuring firm, which sold the remnants to DrKoop.com in November 2000.[26]
In 2003, Pinsky authored Cracked: Putting Broken Lives Together Again, recounting his experiences as the Medical Director of the Department of Chemical Dependency Services at the Las Encinas Hospital drug rehabilitation clinic in Pasadena, California. He also contributed to the book When Painkillers Become Dangerous: What Everyone Needs to Know About OxyContin and Other Prescription Drugs, published in 2004.
In addition to his media appearances, Pinsky speaks at college campuses and other public venues.[27][28] When Adam Carolla and Pinsky were teamed as hosts of Loveline, Carolla and Pinsky spoke at colleges.[29][30][31]
Pinsky was the voice of 1-800-GET-THIN, advocating lap band surgery on radio ads and in a recording played for those who called 1-800-GET-THIN.[32][33][34]
He also appeared with his dogs in a PETA ad campaign promoting the spaying and neutering of pets.[35]
Pinsky was honored with the Larry Stewart Leadership and Inspiration Award at the 12th Annual PRISM Awards in 2008.[37]
In 2009, Pinsky drew criticism from experts for publicly offering professional opinions of celebrities he has never met or personally examined, based on media accounts, and has also drawn the ire of some of those celebrities. Following comments Pinsky made about actor Tom Cruise's belief in Scientology and Lindsay Lohan's drug abuse, Cruise's lawyer compared Pinsky to Joseph Goebbels, and Lohan posted on Twitter, "I thought REAL doctors talked to patients in offices behind closed doors."[44] Pinsky also received criticism in April 2010 for stating that he would frame Lohan for illegal drug use in order to force her into a sobriety program if he were her father.[45] Pinsky responded in the same publication that his remark was intended as hyperbole and a "flight of journalistic excess", not a suggestion as a treatment modality in any way. He stated his intent was to drive home the point about bringing negative consequences to bear for a person dying of addiction when all other options have been exhausted.[46]
Pinsky, who admits in his 2009 book, The Mirror Effect, that he scored a 16 on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (average is 18 for celebrities), and shares several traits with the "closet narcissist", asserts that he was never motivated by fame to become a media figure, but from a desire to educate the public, especially the youth, on the medical facts distorted by the media. Patient Andy Dick, who made Pinsky his primary care physician, disputes the accusation that Pinsky is motivated by a desire for fame, insisting that Pinsky "really is just this unbelievably caring guy. He really is. He’s almost too caring."[47] Sex Rehab alumnus Duncan Roy, however, has criticized Pinsky's competence. While Roy concedes that Pinsky is highly skilled at treating drug and alcohol addiction, he claims that Pinsky has no knowledge of sex addiction, and that he merely recycled the words and ideas of Jill Vermiere, MFT, one of the therapists on Sex Rehab, who Roy says, along with Dr. John Sealy, were the true therapeutic forces behind his recovery.[48]
Defending the practice of paying addicts to attend rehab, producer Pinsky says, "My whole thing is bait and switch. Whatever motivates them to come in, that’s fine. Then we can get them involved with the process."[49]
In January 2012, journalist Jim Romenesko reported that Pinsky accepted $115,000 in consultation fees from Janssen Pharmaceutica in 2010 and 2011.[50] In response, Janssen released a statement that the money was for a program aimed at "educating teens, parents, and educators about the prevalence and serious risks of teen prescription drug abuse in the U.S." CNN Headline News spokesperson Alison Rudnick, which broadcasts Dr. Drew, stated that Pinsky would include on-air disclaimers during any stories involving Janssen. Charles Seife of Slate magazine, however, pointed out in a July 2012 article that no such disclaimer was made during an episode that aired a week earlier on gastric bypass surgery, despite a Los Angeles Times article questioning the propriety of Pinsky's role as a spokesperson for a firm that did marketing for lap-band surgery. Headline News explained that the lap-band deal had elapsed by the time the gastric bypass show aired, making a disclaimer unnecessary.[51]
In July 2012, it was reported that United States prosecutors involved in a criminal prosecution of GlaxoSmithKline for healthcare fraud, in which the company settled for $3 billion, stated that Pinsky was paid $275,000 in March and April 1999 to promote Wellbutrin SR, a Glaxo antidepressant, "in settings where it did not appear that Dr. Pinsky was speaking for GSK." Glaxo marketed the drug being distinct from other antidepressants by not causing a decrease in sex drive, which Pinsky emphasized in his promotions of it, despite the fact that company did not have FDA approval for that claim.[52]
Pinsky married on July 21, 1991, and he and his wife, Susan Sailer, had triplets Douglas, Jordan, and Paulina in November 1992.[53][54][55]
Pinsky lives in Pasadena, California. Interested in fitness since his early teens, he goes running[56] and does weight training regularly.[57] In addition to his hobby of traveling,[12] he also enjoys singing opera, as his mother was a professional singer. Pinsky stated on the June 24, 2009 episode of Loveline that at one point, he was torn between practicing medicine and becoming a professional opera singer.[58] Pinsky stated that he auditioned for a celebrity singing show, but that the show passed on his appearance when he made it clear to producers that he could not sing pop songs, but did perform an aria on Turn Ben Stein On.[59][60][61]
Pinsky's father, Morton, died suddenly of a cerebral hemorrhage on October 27, 2009.[47] A title card at the end of the season 3 finale of Celebrity Rehab dedicated the episode to him.
Pinsky is a nonobservant Jew; he admits to abandoning most Jewish practices but claims to retain a continued desire to learn about the religion. He explains that religious as well as philosophical studies affect his medical practice and his speeches, and that his background places "an indirect coloring on every answer."[62]
In September 2013, Pinsky revealed that he had recovered from prostate cancer surgery performed earlier that June and July, after which Pinsky did not require chemotherapy or radiation.[63]

      If you're doing 20% success, you're really doing very well with a group of addicts, and here we have a group that are mostly unmotivated for treatment; they kind of want to get paid, they want to get on TV; and we're ending up with about half of them really doing very well and nearly all of them, when they finish treatment, start out resistant. When they get question from the press, "don't you feel exploited," they're like "are you kidding, I went in there to exploit those guys, I wanted to get paid, I wanted to screw up their treatment process," and they ended up engaging in treatment and wanting to be an inspiration to other people.

Dr. DrewTV Personality / Physician / Sex AdvisorBorn: 4 September 1958Birthplace: Pasadena, CaliforniaBest known as: The host of Loveline and Celebrity RehabDr. Drew is the stage name of physician Drew Pinsky, a radio and television personality who has been dispensing advice on sex and addiction since the mid-1980s.  Pinsky got his start on the Los Angeles radio station KROQ in 1983, when he was still studying medicine at the University of Southern California.  What began as a once-a-week appearance became a full-time gig in 1984, and, while proceeding with his medical career at Huntington Memorial Hospital, Dr. Drew gained popularity during the late '80s as a radio host.  His breakthrough came while teamed with co-host Adam Carolla, whose locker room humor was a good counterpoint to Dr. Drew's sober -- but hip -- paternalism.  Their show was syndicated in 1995, and until Carolla's departure in 2000, Loveline enjoyed mainstream success on radio and on MTV, replacing Dr. Ruth's as the go-to program for amusingly frank talk about sex.  While Pinsky continued Loveline on the radio, he made a living as a multimedia guest expert, then ventured into reality TV programming.  After some misses, he had a hit with Celebrity Rehab in 2008, a show involving has-been celebrities in "therapy" with Dr. Drew and other addiction experts.  Although critics questioned its efficacy and ethics, the show was popular enough to spawn the spin-offs Sex Rehab with Dr. Drew and Sober House.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC.

USC Frat Email Leaked-- says women are "targets" (!) and not real people. SO OFFENSIVE. http://jezeb[more] 
Susan Pinsky had triplets sixteen years ago.  The thirtysomething UCLA graduate had health insurance and a loving husband who was a successful doctor.  Despite being married to “probably one of the smartest men in America,” she says lovingly of her husband Dr. Drew Pinsky, having triplets was very difficult.  
In the early ‘90s, Susan and Drew Pinsky were a normal couple from Pasadena.  Dr. Drew’s Loveline wasn’t yet nationally syndicated, and he didn’t have multiple television shows.  When they found out they were having triplets, they couldn’t have imagined the uphill battle for their family’s survival.  
Susan experienced a variety of health problems.  She was bed-ridden for three months prior to delivery, and remained in the hospital after the delivery.  The Pinskys soon realized that they had to hire around-the-clock professional help to ensure the safety of their newborns.  “People who have one baby cannot believe that someone who had three could handle it.  One baby is plenty for one human being to endure,” she says.  These triplets ripped through thirty diapers every day.  
“It was worth it,” she says of the effort and sacrifice in raising Douglas, Jordan and Paulina.  Their fraternal triplets are now sixteen, each with a driver’s license.
LAist wondered how trying it must it have been for the Pinskys with triplets, and what that might project for the future of Nadya Suleman and her newborn octuplets.  Suleman, a single mother, has a total of fourteen kids living in her Whittier home.  
I feel for her.  I think it’s a serious situation.  I hope it works out.  It’s not that she’s a bad person.  She’s not some strange trashy person that just decided to have a bunch of kids.  She’s got a degree, she’s well spoken, she means well, and they are her babies -- she should get the respect for that.  They are her children. 
This woman kind of got the short end of the stick.  She clearly didn’t know she was going to end up with 8.  Maybe she was crazy enough to have a couple more but nobody seems to understand that she hadn’t really intended on it.  She didn’t know she had eight until she was 20 weeks pregnant.  Which also shows she didn’t have very good pre-natal care either.  You can know in a couple of weeks.  
I had five embryos implanted and we knew that we had a good chance of having the in vitro take.  When we implanted five, four actually had a heartbeat.  Our Obstetrician was insistent that four would really affect our life.  He said health-wise it would to be tough for me.  I was lucky because one of the embryos didn’t make it past 10 weeks.  Three sounded like better than quadruplets.
It was $100,000 total.  It took 17 people to deliver three babies.  Out of pocket for us was $10,000.  I had a PPO.  They even covered the medication for in vitro at the time -- which they don’t do now.  It was great.  The only thing it didn’t cover was the actual in vitro itself.  I think that the insurance company got rid of me after that.  
Drew and I could’ve afforded it had we done it on our own.  We’d probably still be paying it off now, but we would’ve been able to do it. 
The babies came out completely healthy and normal.  They were ready to go home right away.  My hospital bill was a lot lower than it would’ve been had any of them been in an incubator.  
They stayed in the hospital with me for one week because I was sick after the delivery.  I was in the hospital a week before, and a week after.  It was all worth it. 
When you come home from the hospital after giving birth, it’s really difficult because your body has been traumatized.  I didn’t do very well after the pregnancy.  It took a week or two before I could really be of service to my own children.  
It’s more than anybody can endure.  Maybe she’ll have a support system, but people seem to be turning against her.  
There’s so much stuff that you use that helps you get through the day.  You have to stock the refrigerator with 10 bottles per kid everyday.  Somebody has to get up, wash all the bottles, fill all the bottles, and put them in the refrigerator.  Then you have to wash them and start over again.  She’s going to have to sanitize the bottles.  We used a microwave sanitizing system.  
They tend to need a change of clothing regularly because they are so extremely burpy.  She needs to have enough clothing for everybody plus she needs a good washer and dryer -- and someone to work the washer and dryer.  
Drew was a big help but I had to have help around the clock.  The manpower needed to provide a safe environment is astounding and goes on 24 hours, 7 days a week.  Overnight nurses are key so mom can recover after delivery.  Having multiples can be fatal not only for the babies, but for the mother.  
Picture five bottles and 10 diapers each per child, per day.  If you can’t afford help, you’re really putting these kids at risk.  If you have three mouths, or six or eight -- you don’t have enough energy as a human being to be able to handle that.
It’s all fun the first couple of weeks, but after that they sort of disappear.  At a certain point the house becomes exhausted.  Unless you’re paying someone, you can’t really expect them to stay when you really need them the most.  
These kids are precious, fragile human beings and if she has any respect for that she’ll do the right thing.  If that means she needs to adopt them out to great parents that can raise them, then that might be it.  I’m not saying the right thing has to be adoption -- but I guess there’s no other way -- that’s why it’s hard.
I had one baby with colic.  He cried for three months straight.  A nanny took him under her wing.  I needed somebody who went home and slept at night to come back and hold him and do whatever it was we were trying to do to get him stop crying all the time.  
If Nadya has 4 kids with colic, it’s going to be a nightmare.  Talk about a lot of screaming and crying.  
I went a little bit crazy at certain points.  You can’t imagine the sleep deprivation.  I didn’t sleep for the first two and a half years.
Douglas had some issues with sleep because he had an arachnoid cyst growing on his brain and we didn’t know it.  He’d wake up every night and he would cry and spit out his pacifier.  Because he wasn’t sleeping through the night I was getting sicker and sicker.  
We had baby seats for keeping them in a safe place.  If we were holding two, one would stay in the baby seat. 
I was a travel agent for a while when they were small.  I was having a good time with that.  I could work with adults and work out of my home.  I took Laura Schlessinger's advice, I was a stay-at-home mom, a working mom.  
Then after the World Trade Center, Drew requested I make being a mother my career.  I said I’m in.  Now they’re all going to graduate from high school in 2 years.   I have to figure out what I’m going to do next.  
My kids are doing great.  They are substantial human beings.  I’m happy that I’ve had that opportunity to be part of that.  I‘ve dedicated myself to being a mother.  It’s probably the hardest job there is.  It’s not an easy life.  People give me a lot of respect for it, for what I’ve done, and I really appreciate that.  
I’m lucky to have Drew and his support and his medical background because otherwise it would’ve been really difficult for me.  I’m not an expert at this.  I get an education everyday. 
This woman is delusional, that she is going to give them her time -- that’s all they need.  That’s not possible.  One person cannot care for six kids, let alone 14.  
She thinks she’s going to nurse all of these kids.  Really, that’s just hysterical.  There’s no way that’s going to happen.  
If you have a $50,000 student loan, with 16 kids and you think you’re going to go back to college and make a living, and pay your debts -- that’s great.  More power to you.  Honestly, unless she gets an endorsement from some company and does a commercial she’s not going to be able to pay it off. 
Let’s not just shun her and turn her into a villain.  She’s crazy but turning our back on her isn’t going to make it better.  I would like Nadya to have the opportunity to be a part of her own family and love her kids.  When I see the love she has for those kids -- my heart goes out to her -- she really does want those children.  
If I had a wish it would be for her to get support from the correct organizations so that she doesn’t crash and burn.
