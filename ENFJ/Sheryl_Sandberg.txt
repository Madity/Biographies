Sheryl Kara Sandberg (/ˈsændbərɡ, bərɡ/; born August 28, 1969)[3] is an American technology executive, activist, and author. As of August 2013, she is the chief operating officer of Facebook. In June 2012, she was elected to the board of directors by the existing board members[4] becoming the first woman to serve on Facebook's board. Before Facebook, Sandberg was Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations at Google, and was involved in launching Google's philanthropic arm Google.org. Before Google, Sandberg served as chief of staff for the United States Secretary of the Treasury.
In 2012 she was named in the Time 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world according to Time magazine.[5] As of January 2014, Sandberg is reported to be worth over US$1 billion, due to her stock holdings in Facebook and other companies.[6]
Sandberg was born in 1969, in Washington, D.C., in a Jewish American family,[2] the daughter of Adele (née Einhorn) and Joel Sandberg, and the oldest of three children.[3][7] Her father is an ophthalmologist, and her mother holds a PhD and worked as a French teacher before concentrating on raising her children.[8] Her maternal grandmother, Rosalind Einhorn passed away at the age of 94 in November 2011 had a profound impact in her life.[9] Her grandmother grew up in a poor Jewish American family in a crowded apartment in New York City, finished high school in spite of being pulled out during The Great Depression, then went on to community college and graduated from U.C. Berkeley and later saved her family business from financial ruin.[10][11] Her brother is also a Harvard graduate and became a pediatric neurosurgeon who now practices at Miami Children’s Hospital and her sister Michelle is a fellow Harvard graduate who now is a pediatrician based in Santa Clara, California.[12]
Her family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, when she was two years old.[2] She attended North Miami Beach High School, where she was "always at the top of her class." and graduated ninth in her class with a 4.646 grade point average.[2] She was a member of the National Honors Society and on the senior class executive board.[13] Sandberg taught aerobics in the 1980s while in high school.[14]
In 1987, Sandberg enrolled at Harvard College and graduated in 1991 summa cum laude with a B.A. in economics and was awarded the John H. Williams Prize for the top graduating student in economics.[15] While at Harvard, Sandberg met then-professor Larry Summers who became her mentor and thesis adviser.[16] Summers recruited her to be his research assistant at the World Bank,[2] where she worked for approximately one year on health projects in India dealing with leprosy, AIDS, and blindness.[17]
In 1993 she enrolled at Harvard Business School and in 1995 she earned her M.B.A. with highest distinction.[15]
After graduating from business school in the spring of 1995, Sandberg worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company for approximately one year (1995-1996). From 1996 to 2001, Sandberg served as Chief of Staff to then United States Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers under President Bill Clinton, where she helped lead the Treasury's work on forgiving debt in the developing world during the Asian financial crisis.[17] She joined Google Inc. in 2001, serving as its Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations from November 2001 to March 2008. She was responsible for online sales of Google's advertising and publishing products as well as for sales operations of Google's consumer products and Google Book Search.[18]
In late 2007, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by Dan Rosensweig; at the time, she was considering becoming a senior executive for The Washington Post Company.[2] Zuckerberg had no formal search for a COO, but thought of Sandberg as "a perfect fit" for this role.[2] They spent more time together in January 2008 at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and in March 2008, Facebook announced hiring Sheryl Sandberg away from Google.[19]
After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was "primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow."[2] By late spring, Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, "with the ads discreetly presented"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.[2] According to Facebook, Sandberg oversees the firm's business operations including sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy and communications.[20]
Sandberg's executive compensation for FY 2011 was $300,000 base salary plus $30,491,613 in FB shares.[21] According to her Form 3, she also owns 38,122,000 stock options and restricted stock units (worth approx. $1.45 billion as of mid-May 2012) that will be completely vested by May 2022, subject to her continued employment through the vesting date.[22]
In 2012 she became the eighth member (and the first female member) of Facebook's board of directors.[23]
In October 2012, Business Insider reported that stock units (appx. 34 million) vested in Sandberg's name accounted for nearly US$790,000,000. Facebook withheld roughly 15 million of those stocks for tax reasons, leaving Sandberg with nearly US$417,000,000.[citation needed] The media reported on August 12, 2013 that Sandberg sold 2.4m shares in the company worth US$91 million (£51 million)—5 percent of her total stake in the company.[24]
In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO she held approximately 41 million shares in the company, and after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, a 0.5% stake in the company, worth about one billion dollars.[25]
Sandberg was married at age 24; however, she got divorced a year later. She then went on to marry David Goldberg, the current CEO of SurveyMonkey,[26] in 2004, with whom she has two children.[3][27]
Sandberg and her husband have frequently discussed being in a Shared Earning/Shared Parenting Marriage.[28]
In 2009, Sandberg was named to the board of The Walt Disney Company.[29] She also serves on the boards of Women for Women International, the Center for Global Development and V-Day.[20] She was previously a board member of Starbucks with a $280,000 annual salary,[30] Brookings Institution and Ad Council.
In 2012, Newsweek and The Daily Beast released their first "Digital Power Index," a list of the 100 most significant people in the digital world that year (plus 10 additional "Lifetime Achievement" winners), and she was ranked #3 in the "Evangelists" category.[41]
In 2013, she was ranked #8 on the "The World's 50 Most Influential Jews" conducted by the Jerusalem Post.[42]
Also in 2012, she was named in Time 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world assembled by Time.[5]
In 2008, Sandberg wrote an article for The Huffington Post in support of her mentor, Larry Summers, who was under fire for his comments about women.[43] She was a keynote speaker at the Jewish Community Federation's Business Leadership Council in 2010.[44] In December 2010, she gave a TED speech titled "Why we have too few women leaders."[45] In May 2011 she gave the Commencement Address at the Barnard College graduation ceremony.[46] She spoke as the keynote speaker at the Class Day ceremony at the Harvard Business School in May 2012.[47] In April 2013, she was the keynote speaker for Colgate University's second annual Entrepreneur Weekend.[48]
In 2013, Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-written with journalist and TV writer Nell Scovell. It is about business leadership and development, issues with the lack of women in government and business leadership positions, and feminism.[49][50][51][52][53][54]
Sheryl Sandberg released her first book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, co-authored by Nell Scovell and published by Knopf on March 11, 2013. As of the fall of 2013, The book sold more than one million copies and was on top of the bestseller lists since its launch.[26]
Lean In is a book for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book looks at the barriers preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism and sexual harassment.[55] She also examines societal barriers such as the fact that women still work the double day and the devaluing of work inside the home as opposed to work outside the home. Along with the latter there are the barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she asserts that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.
A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.[56]
Sandberg's book inspired the Lean In movement, which aims to help women achieve their professional and personal goals by "leaning into their ambitions".[57] The movement provides support in three key ways: community, education and circles. The community focuses on exchanging information and ideas through stories to encourage other women to lean in. The education section is a collection of free lectures to help individuals develop their skills and learn new ones. Lastly the circle's component focuses on small groups that provide a safe online space for collaboration and support.
One critic claimed that Sandberg is “too elitist” and another that she is “tone-deaf to the problems average women face as they struggle to make ends meet in a rough economy, while taking care of kids, aging parents and housework”.[58][59]
Sandberg addresses both of these issues in the introduction of her book, stating that she is “acutely aware that the vast majority of women are struggling to make ends meet and take care of their families. Parts of this book will be most relevant to women fortunate enough to have choices about how much and when and where to work”[60] and that “my intention is to offer advice that would have been useful long before I had heard of Google or Facebook and that will resonate with women in a broad range of circumstances.”[61]
The book was shortlisted for the Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award (2013).[62]

Sheryl SandbergBusiness PersonalityBorn: 28 August 1969Birthplace: Washington, D.C.Best known as: COO of Facebook, 2008-presentSheryl Sandberg's remarkable career has included stops at the World Bank, the U.S. Treasury, Google and Facebook, where she's been Chief Operating Officer since 2008. Sheryl Sandberg grew up in North Miami Beach, Florida, and studied economics at Harvard. After her graduation in 1991, she worked at the World Bank as a research assistant to Lawrence Summers (who had been her professor and thesis advisor at Harvard), then went on to Harvard Business School, earning an MBA in 1995. She joined Summers again when he was Deputy Treasury Secretary under Robert Rubin; when Summers became Treasury Secretary himself in 1999, Sandberg advanced as his chief of staff. She was 29 years old. After Summers' term ended in 2001, Sandberg moved to California and joined Larry Page and Sergey Brin at a fledgling company called Google. As Vice President of Global Online Sales & Operations, she helped build the super-successful AdWords and AdSense advertising services, which made the company billions of dollars. In 2008 she was hired away by Mark Zuckerberg to become COO of Facebook. Her position as one of Silicon Valley's most successful female executives has made her a lightning rod for both praise and criticism, especially after the publication of her 2013 book Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead in 2013.Extra credit: Sheryl Sandberg has been married twice. Her first marriage was to Brian Kraff; they were married briefly and then divorced in 2004, according to Wikipedia. Kraff is a co-founder of the company Market Hardware. Sandberg's second marriage was to David Goldberg in 2004. They have two children: a son born in 2005 and a daughter born in 2007. A 2011 New Yorker profile described Goldberg as "her longtime best friend." He is also a high-tech executive who has worked at Yahoo and SurveyMonkey... Forbes magazine named Sandberg #5 on its list of "Power Women" in 2011; the next year the magazine estimated her worth at $500 million. Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC.

As the COO at the helm of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg juggles the tasks of monetizing the world’s largest social networking site while keeping its users happy and engaged.
Long before Sheryl Sandberg left Google to join Facebook as its Chief Operating Ofﬁcer in 2008, she was a fan. Today she manages Facebook’s sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy and communications. It’s a massive job, but one well suited to Sandberg, who not only built and managed Google’s successful online sales and operations program but also served as an economist for the World Bank and Chief of Staff at the US Treasury Department. Sandberg’s experience navigating the the complex and socially sensitive world of international economics has proven useful as she and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg work to strike a balance between helping Facebook users control privacy while ﬁnding ways to monetize its most valuable asset: data.At TEDWomen in 2010 Sandberg made the bold decision to talk about the experience of being one of very few women at the C-level of business. She noted that many women, in anticpating having a family, "lean back" from leading at work. After her TED Talk took off, Sandberg wrote the book Lean In, which has spent nearly a year on the New York Times Bestseller list. Sandberg plans to release a version of the book for graduates.
"Whether you call it “scaling the company” or “managing hypergrowth,” Sandberg is one of the few executives on earth with a demonstrated knack for it. It’s clear why Zuckerberg, in particular, needed her." —
During an interview at TEDWomen 2013, host Pat Mitchell asked Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg to explain how her 2010 TED Talk evolved. “I asked myself the question that Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook and my boss, asks all of us, which is: What would I do if I wasn’t afraid?” Sandberg said. Her answer: “I […]

Sheryl Sandberg on being a geek, a successful working mom, and getting more women a seat at the power table.
Cause of Choice: Women for Women InternationalFirst Jobs: Saturday office manager at her father's ophthalmology practice and retail sales clerk at the mallHealthy Home: Her father, siblings, and sister-in-law are all doctors. She considers herself the black sheep for choosing business instead of medicine.Parental Role Models: "The combination of my father's drive and my mother's warmth is something I've tried to live up to. I don't think I do. You never quite live up to your parents."
By now, Sheryl Sandberg has spent more than two decades achieving at the highest reaches of governmental and corporate America.  And she’s determined to bring more talented young women along with her. Sandberg earned both an economics BA summa cum laude and an MBA from Harvard and worked for McKinsey and the World Bank before serving as Chief of Staff for the United States Treasury Department. As Vice President of Global Online Sales and Operations at Google, she was instrumental in building what is now one of the most influential enterprises on the planet. But Sandberg’s entrepreneurial instincts drove her onward. She joined the then-fledgling Facebook in 2008.
She joined Facebook in 2008 as its Chief Operating Officer and is credited with first establishing it as a profitable business. The brilliance of Sandberg’s management style is, in a sense, basic: “She builds trust because she’s honest,” her Facebook colleague Chris Cox has said. And as one of leading corporate lights of her day, Sandberg spends much of her time mentoring female executives and speaking passionately on the specific challenges they face. Says another (male) colleague: “A key part of what Sheryl does in her life is helping people advance, to be seen and to be heard.”
