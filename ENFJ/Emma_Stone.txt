Emily Jean "Emma" Stone (born November 6, 1988)[1] is an American actress. She made her feature film debut in Superbad (2007). She has co-starred in The House Bunny (2008), Zombieland (2009), and Paper Man (2009). In 2010, Stone played the lead role in Easy A, for which she received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Other notable roles have included Skeeter Phelan in The Help (2011), Gwen Stacy in the Amazing Spider-Man film series (2012 & 2014),[2] and the voice of Eep in the animated film The Croods (2013).
Stone was born in Scottsdale, Arizona, to Jeff Stone, a founder and CEO of a general-contracting company, and Krista (née Yeager), a homemaker.[3] Her parents are co-owners of the Camelback Golf Club, and Stone lived on the grounds of the Camelback Inn resort from the age of twelve.[4][5] She has a brother Spencer, who is two years younger.[6] Stone's paternal grandfather, Conrad Ostberg Stone, was of Swedish descent, and his family's original surname "Sten" was anglicized to "Stone" when immigrating to the U.S. through Ellis Island. Her other ancestry is Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, Scottish, and Irish.[7][8]
Stone attended Sequoya Elementary School and then Cocopah Middle School for the sixth grade. She was homeschooled for two years, during which time she appeared in sixteen productions at Valley Youth Theatre, including The Princess and the Pea, Alice in Wonderland, and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,[9][10] and performed with the theater's improv comedy troupe.[9][11] Her parents also sent her for private lessons with a local acting coach who had worked at the William Morris Agency in the 1970s and still had Hollywood connections.[3]
Stone attended Xavier College Preparatory,[9] an all-girl Catholic high school, as a freshman for one semester. Despite this, she was raised as a Lutheran.[3] She gave a PowerPoint presentation to her parents, set to the Madonna song "Hollywood", to convince them to let her move to California for an acting career.[12] In January 2004, at the age of fifteen, she moved with her mother to a Los Angeles apartment and began homeschooling again.[13]
Stone is naturally blonde. She won her first role as a teenager after dyeing her hair dark brown.[14] Judd Apatow, the producer of Superbad, then had Stone dye her hair from dark brown to red for her role in the film.[11] She returned to blonde for her role in The Amazing Spider-Man.[15]
There was already a listing for an "Emily Stone" when Stone registered for the Screen Actors Guild, so she chose "Emma" as her stage name. Her family and friends call her Emily.[15] She first chose "Riley Stone" as her stage name, but after guest-starring on Malcolm in the Middle, she decided that she was more comfortable with "Emma", a nickname that her mother had given her.[16]
Stone's low-pitched husky voice is a result of having baby colic, a condition of chronic crying as an infant, resulting in the development of nodules. She has calluses on her vocal cords as an adult.[17]
Stone made her television debut as Laurie Partridge on In Search of the New Partridge Family (2004), a VH1 talent competition reality show.[18] The resulting show, retitled The New Partridge Family (2005), only produced an unsold pilot. Afterwards, Stone guest-starred in a number of television series including Medium, Malcolm in the Middle and Lucky Louie. She auditioned to star in the NBC science fiction drama Heroes as Claire Bennet, and overheard in the casting room "On a scale of 1 to 10, you are an 11"—but the casting directors were referring to Hayden Panettiere, who was cast instead. Stone called this experience "rock bottom".[19] In April 2007, she starred in the Fox action drama Drive, as Violet Trimble, but the show was canceled after seven episodes.
Stone made her feature film debut in the comedy Superbad (2007) with Michael Cera and Jonah Hill, directed by Greg Mottola as Jules, the love interest of Seth (Hill). The following year, she co-starred with Rainn Wilson and Teddy Geiger in the comedy The Rocker (2008) directed by Peter Catteneo, where she played Amelia, the bass guitarist in a band featuring Geiger that she learned to play bass for the role. Later that year, Stone co-starred with Anna Faris, Colin Hanks and Kat Dennings in the romantic comedy The House Bunny, directed by Fred Wolf[20] where she played Natalie, the president of a sorority and sang on a single from the film, "I Know What Boys Like", a cover version of the 1982 song by The Waitresses.[21]
Stone co-starred with Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner and Michael Douglas in the romantic comedy Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (2009), a takeoff of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, directed by Mark Waters,[22] where she played Allison Vandermeersh, "The Ghost of Girlfriends Past", who haunts Conor Mead (McConaughey), a womanizing photographer who does not believe in true love. She co-starred with Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson and Abigail Breslin in the horror/comedy Zombieland directed by Ruben Fleischer, where she played Wichita, a survivor and con artist from Wichita, Kansas, traveling across the U.S. with her younger sister Little Rock (Breslin). Eventually, she reveals that her real name is "Krista", which is coincidentally the name of Stone's real life mother.[23] The project began shooting in Atlanta in February 2009.[24]
Later that year, Stone co-starred with Jeff Daniels, Ryan Reynolds and Lisa Kudrow in Kieran and Michelle Mulroney's comedy Paper Man (2009),[25] as Abby, a babysitter that Richard Dunn (Daniels) hires after moving to Long Island.[26] Stone began filming her scenes on November 11, 2008, in Montauk, New York, using well-known local locations.[27]
Stone co-starred with Owen Wilson in the comedy Marmaduke (2010) directed by Tom Dey, a live-action adaptation of Brad Anderson's long-running comic strip of the same name,[28] where she voiced Mazie, a tomboyish Australian Shepherd and a friend of Marmaduke (voiced by Wilson).[29] The same year, Stone starred in her first leading role in the comedy Easy A directed by Will Gluck,[30] as Olive Penderghast, a high school student who scandalizes her teachers and in particular, her more conservatively religious classmates after a false rumor circulates that she is sexually promiscuous.[31] The script was written by Bert V. Royal and contrasts the historical romance novel The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne and its heroine, Hester Prynne, to the life of Prynne in the film versions. Stone read the script before the project was optioned for production, and kept an eye on it along with her manager until preparations were made.[32] Stone was attracted to the script because it was "funny and sweet" and her character was "fantastic from the first read" who was "fleshed [..] out so much in the script".[32] When Stone discovered that the film had gone into production, she met with Gluck to express her enthusiasm about the project.[32] A few months later, the audition process started and Stone met with Gluck again to be one of the first actresses to audition.[32] Stone was nominated for the 2011 Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy for her role.[33]
Stone appeared at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010, and introduced Linkin Park, she stated in 2008 that she would eventually like to venture into film production, producing her own films and that her dream was to appear on the NBC late-night sketch comedy Saturday Night Live.[20] Stone hosted the show on October 23, 2010, and again on November 12, 2011.[34][35]
Stone collaborated with Will Gluck again and co-starred with Justin Timberlake in Gluck's sex comedy Friends with Benefits, as Kayla who breaks up with Dylan Harper (Timberlake). The film began filming in July 2010, in Los Angeles and New York City, and was released on July 22, 2011.[36] Later that year, Stone co-starred with Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling in the Warner Bros. romantic comedy-drama Crazy, Stupid, Love., directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa as Hannah, a law school graduate. The film began shooting on April 16, 2010 in Los Angeles and was released on July 29, 2011.[37] Stone starred in the Touchstone Pictures and DreamWorks Studios drama film The Help directed by Tate Taylor, an adaptation of Kathryn Stockett's novel of the same name and a period piece set in Jackson, Mississippi, in the 1960s, where she played Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan, an aspiring writer learning about the lives of the African-American maids. She used a Southern dialect for the role.[26]
Stone co-starred with Andrew Garfield in the superhero film The Amazing Spider-Man directed by Marc Webb, and is a reboot of the Spider-Man film series,[38] where she played Gwen Stacy, the seventeen-year-old classmate and the love interest of Peter Parker (Garfield).[39] The film went into production in December 2010 and commenced in April 2011.[40] Stone was considered to co-star in a reboot of 21 Jump Street, with her Superbad co-star Jonah Hill,[41] but she turned the role down, after signing on to The Amazing Spider-Man,[42] which was released on July 3, 2012.[38]
Stone co-starred in the DreamWorks 3-D computer animated caveman comedy The Croods, directed by Kirk De Micco and Chris Sanders as Eep, the oldest daughter of Grug (voiced by Nicolas Cage) and Ugga (voiced by Catherine Keener), with the love interest, Guy (voiced by Ryan Reynolds).[43] The film was released on March 22, 2013. She co-starred as the title role in the comedic short film Veronica, with Kieran Culkin and directed by Griffin Dunne.[44] and is one of sixteen segments of the anthology film, Movie 43.[45] The feature film was produced by the Farrelly brothers.[14]
Stone co-starred with Ryan Gosling again and Sean Penn in the crime drama film Gangster Squad, directed by Ruben Fleischer and based on a true story set in the 1940s where she played Grace Faraday who enters a love triangle with LAPD Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Gosling) and mob boss Mickey Cohen (Penn).[46] The film was released on January 11, 2013 in North America.[47]
Stone plans to work with writer and director Will Gluck for a third time, starring in and executive producing a comedy film for Screen Gems.[48] The film studio has given Gluck and Stone full discretion in developing a new project, after the success of Easy A, their first film collaboration.[15]
In mid-2012, Stone voiced a supporting role in the crime-based video game, Sleeping Dogs.[49] Stone also reprised her role of Gwen Stacy in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, for which her performance was well received by critics.[50] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post mentioned that "Stone [...] once again delivers a winning and mostly believable performance as the smart, self-possessed Gwen."[51]
She signed on to co-star in Cameron Crowe's untitled romantic comedy, that was initially titled Deep Tiki, with Bradley Cooper for Sony Pictures that began filming in Hawaii in September 2013 and is scheduled to be released on December 25, 2014.[52] Stone signed on to co-star in Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu's comedy Birdman with Michael Keaton.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Emma Stone was born in Scottsdale, Arizona, to Krista (Yeager), a homemaker, and Jeffrey Stone, a contracting company founder and CEO. Stone began acting as a child as a member of the Valley Youth Theatre in Phoenix, Arizona, where she made her stage debut in a production of Kenneth Grahame's "The Wind in the Willows". She appeared in many more productions through her early teens until, at the age of 15, she decided that she wanted to make acting her career.The official story is that she made a PowerPoint presentation, backed by Madonna's "Hollywood" and itself entitled "Project Hollywood", in an attempt to persuade her parents to allow her to drop out of school and move to Los Angeles. The pitch was successful and she and her mother moved to LA with her schooling completed at home while she spent her days auditioning.She had her TV breakthrough when she won the part of Laurie Partridge in the VH1 talent/reality show In Search of the Partridge Family (2004) which led to a number of small TV roles in the following years.Her movie debut was as Jules in Superbad (2007) and, after a string of successful performances, her leading role as Olive in Easy A (2010) established her as a star.
      Although she's known as a redhead, her natural hair color is blonde. It was Judd Apatow who suggested she change her hair color for Superbad (2007) and she liked it so much that she decided to keep it.
      She convinced her parents to let her move to Hollywood when she was age 15 by making a PowerPoint presentation aptly titled, Project Hollywood.
      She got her start in acting at eleven years old at the Valley Youth Theatre in Phoenix, Arizona, where she starred in over sixteen stage productions as well as performing the the theatre's comedy improv troupe.
      Emma has Swedish ancestry through her paternal grandfather, Conrad Ostberg Stone. Conrad's parents, Conrad August Stone and Florence Jeanette Ostberg, were both the children of Swedish immigrants, and the family's original surname, "Sten", had been changed to "Stone". Emma's other ancestry includes Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, Irish and Scottish.
      Her favorite films are City Lights (1931), Harold and Maude (1971), Network (1976) and Manhattan (1979).
      Her family's surname was anglicized to "Stone" when immigrating to the United States through Ellis Island.
      Auditioned for the role of Claire Bennet in Heroes (2006), but lost out to Hayden Panettiere. She referred to this experience as "rock bottom".
      Started to use "Emma" as her professional name, because there was already an "Emily Stone" when she applied for her SAG card.
      In two of her films, Easy A (2010) and Crazy, Stupid, Love. (2011), Nathaniel Hawthorne's "The Scarlet Letter" is discussed.
      Was considered for the lead female role in 21 Jump Street (2012), but she had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts with The Amazing Spider-Man (2012).
      New York, NY, USA: Unexpectedly announced that she has decided to pull out of her planned co-starring role with Alan Cumming--and forgo her Broadway debut--in the 2014 revival production of the musical 'Cabaret'. The Sally Bowles role ultimately went to Michelle Williams under the direction of Sam Mendes (2014). [June 2013]
      [on shooting Superbad (2007)] It's incredible, it's been really fun and really funny and I can't stop breaking character which is getting me in trouble sometimes but it's alright, ya know...I just keep laughing.
      I've got a great family and great people around me that would be able to kick me in the shins if I ever for one minute got lost up in the clouds. I've been really lucky in that sense.
      Haven't had to fight off any Seth characters. And I'm not fighting him off. It's a situation where I really do like him. I just don't want our first kiss to happen in that situation. But, no, I've never really had that experience. Of someone coming on to me being out of their mind drunk. I'm the lucky one, maybe.
      [on it being difficult for women to get into comedy] - There really aren't many parts. It's an unfortunate thing and something I hope will change, but never has, and who knows if it will? I think Saturday Night Live (1975), starting in the 1970s, really gave women an outlet to be funny. A lot of those women went on to have film careers, from Kristen Wiig now to Tina Fey and Gilda Radner.Nowadays it seems like the real goldmine is in creating your own characters and teaming with a good writer, but its not easy. It's a scary thing for a woman to put yourself out there and look like an idiot. Look at Lucille Ball. She said, 'I'm not funny. What I am is brave'. The comediennes I admire are the bravest people who aren't afraid to look ridiculous. Maybe that's a harder notion for women - the fear of not looking their best.
      I realize I have a lot of amazing opportunities, but I don't know how you can play a human being going through real human experiences without being able to walk down the street. If you can't live a real life, how do you play a real person? It always confuses me when actors work back-to-back-to-back with no break. If you live your life on a film set, how the hell can you relate to real people? You don't know what its like to not have people fussing over you all day, and that's not life - that's silly movies. I will always want to take breaks and I wouldn't be OK with losing that.
      [on her hair for her role in The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)] I have blonde hair now since Gwen (Stacy) has blonde hair. My hair is naturally blonde, so it's kind of nice. I look in the mirror and say, "Oh my God, it's me again, it's been so long!"
      The truth is I am naturally blonde anyway. Everyone thinks I'm a redhead but that's just dyed. I'm actually enjoying being a blonde again. It's been a while.
      Blondes do have more fun. But sometimes I look in the mirror and still feel like I'm wearing a wig.
      Y'know when you think 'I can't do something because this or this or this.' You can actually do anything you want, like I could ballistic right now and tear this whole room apart, I could but i'm not going to because logic is stopping me but you can do whatever you want. You really can veer off any path at any time. Never give up!
      I was a stepsister in a local production of "Cinderella". I had crazy red hair in a cone shape and lots of blue eye shadow. I had braces at the time, so whenever I smiled it was all red lipstick on my teeth, which was really attractive. After that I did a play called "Noises Off", and when that was over I thought, I really want to be in movies. So I asked my parents and eventually they said yes.
      [on beauty] Confidence is the only key. I know a lot of people who aren't traditionally 'beautiful' - not symmetrical or perfect-bodied or perfect-skinned. But none of that matters because all that shines through is their confidence, humor and comfort with themselves. I can't think of any better representation of beauty than someone who is unafraid to be herself.
      [on Crazy, Stupid, Love. (2011)] First of all, do you know how rare it is that you read an original script - a story that isn't a sequel, prequel, threequel? But this movie covers all of these different kind of relationships, and it looks at them in original ways. How unusual is it that you see a story in which a woman cheats on her husband but you also root for them to get back together?
      [on performing flying-stunt sequences in 'The Amazing Spider-Man']I will say this about wirework. It's like the difference between roller coaster and bungee jump. I'm fine in a roller coaster. but put me in a bungee thing where they shoot you up and you freefall? I don't like that. It's fine if there's a track and some kind of harness, but I get really freaked-out if it's in any way a freefall.
      We went to Coronado every summer, so I always think of driving over that bridge from San Diego, and then walking down that little strip on the main street, going cosmic bowling at midnight, eating at this 24-hour diner at 3 a.m. - that's summer to me. We'd just hang out on the beach and walk around and go to Hotel Del Coronado, and learn about the ghost of the Hotel Del.
      There's this Ryan Gosling quote that I steal all the time - I watched an interview with him in Cannes - and he said picking roles is like listening to songs on the radio: There can be a lot of really great songs in a row, but then one comes on that just makes you want to dance.
      My instincts seem to come from a different place - they feel headier to me, and I get the wrong scent and go off on these whims.
      I learned to play the bass for The Rocker (2008). They sent over a bass coach the night I got the role, so I had to get into it right away and get calluses as quickly as possible. So I can play all the songs in the movie, but that's pretty much where the line ends. I bought a Fender Mustang bass, a really nice off-white, ivory bass, when I got home. I have not touched it since. And I need to. It's in my house, it's sitting there waiting. You know what? After this conversation, I'm going to go play some bass. That's what's going to happen.
      [on providing a voice for Eep in 'The Croods'] I'm a cave girl, yeah! So I got to go nuts, which was great. I like not to reel it in and when you're a cartoon you can act as crazy as you want.
      I'm a big fan of Lauren Bacall. Maybe because everyone was smoking more heavily then, but that raspy, throaty quality seems to be much more prevalent in those '40s movies. Mine was from colic when I was a baby.
      It's nice to know that even when you're shooting a movie like The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) that you approach the character the same way, and you're trying to tell the truth, all the time, about who that person is and what they're feeling. So it's comforting that under any circumstance no matter what the budget that that remains the same. This feels different. The press feels different. This is where it really strikes you that you're in Spider-Man.
      I went through a list of names and picked Riley. But then I had a guest part on Malcolm in the Middle (2000), and everyone kept on yelling, "Riley!" and I didn't know who they were talking to.
      I do find that I am drawn to people in my life, romantically or not, that have something to teach me... There is some sense of being changed.
      I won't make a bucket list because I'm so afraid that I'll die and then people will find my bucket list and be, like, "Oh, she didn't get to do that."
      When I was 14 years old, I made this PowerPoint presentation, and I invited my parents into my room and gave them popcorn. It was called "Project Hollywood 2004" and it worked. I moved to L.A. in January of 2004.
      My parents always made me feel as though I could do anything -- not in a cheerleading, "You're the greatest!" kind of way; it was more, "You're going to have to work hard, but we'll support you however we can."

=======================================================
Emma Stone's desire to be an actress began at a young age. As a child, her parents enrolled her at the Valley Youth Theatre near their Scottsdale, Arizona home. At age 11, Stone made her stage debut starring in The Wind in the Willows and would go on to star in over a dozen more productions at the youth theatre.
Stone moved to Los Angeles with her mother when she was 15 years old, and began acting professionally soon after. She first appeared in the VH1 reality TV show In Search of The Partridge Family in 2004. The show was a nationwide search for actors to star in a sitcom remake of the hit '70s show The Partridge Family. Stone won the coveted role of Laurie Partridge, and although the show was cancelled after the pilot, it served as a springboard for the young actress' career.
Over the next few years, Stone appeared in a number of popular TV shows including Medium, The Suite Life of Zack and Cody and Malcom in the Middle. She then landed a recurring role on the short-lived Fox drama Drive.
Stone began her film career with a prominent role in the raunchy teen comedy Superbad (2007), before moving on to roles in The Rocker (2008), The House Bunny (2008),  Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (2009), but it was when she starred in Easy A (2010) that Emma earned A-list status, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for her work in the movie and an MTV Award.

The physically stunning actress Emma Stone first made her mark among American audiences as an ingenue, via her involvement in the massively successful comedy Superbad (2007). The actress's combination of deadpan comic timing and undeniable beauty made her an instant hot property in Hollywood, and she was soon appearing in comic fare like The House Bunny and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, as well as the hugely successful horror comedy Zombieland (2009). By 2010, Stone had earned top billing status, and was starring in her own comedy -- a hilarious modern take on the Scarlet Letter called Easy A. The following year found Sone's star rising even further in the realm of comedy with roles in Friends with Benefits and Crazy, Stupid, Love, but it also proved to be the year in which the young actress branched more full force into drama, starring in the much anticipated adaptation of the Kathryn Stockett novel The Help. She became part of a superhero franchise when she took over the part of Gwen Stacy in 2012's The Amazing Spider-Man, and she took a part in the period crime film Gangster Squad that same year. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi
