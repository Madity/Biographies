Daniel Jay Goleman (born March 7, 1946) is an author, psychologist, and science journalist. For twelve years, he wrote for The New York Times, specializing in psychology and brain sciences. He is the author of more than 10 books on psychology, education, science, ecological crisis, and leadership. He is a two-time Pulitzer Prize nominee.[1]
Goleman was born in 1946 in Stockton, California, the son of Jewish college professors. He received a scholarship from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to attend Amherst College. The Amherst Independent Scholar program allowed him to transfer for his junior year to the University of California at Berkeley. He then returned to Amherst where he graduated magna cum laude. He then received a scholarship from the Ford Foundation to attend Harvard University where he received his PhD studying under David C. McClelland. He studied in India using a pre-doctoral fellowship from Harvard and a post-doctoral grant from the Social Science Research Council. He wrote his first book based on travel in India and Sri Lanka and then returned as a visiting lecturer to Harvard where during the 1970s his topic of the psychology of consciousness was popular. McClelland recommended him for a job at Psychology Today from which he was recruited by The New York Times in 1984.[2]
Goleman co-founded the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning at Yale University's Child Studies Center which then moved to the University of Illinois at Chicago. Currently he co-directs the Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations at Rutgers University. He sits on the board of the Mind & Life Institute.[2]
Goleman authored the internationally best-selling book, Emotional Intelligence (1995, Bantam Books), that spent more than one-and-a-half years on The New York Times Best Seller list. Goleman developed the argument that non-cognitive skills can matter as much as I.Q. for workplace success in Working with Emotional Intelligence (1998, Bantam Books), and for leadership effectiveness in Primal Leadership (2001, Harvard Business School Press). Goleman's most recent best-seller is Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (2006, Bantam Books).
He developed The Emotional Intelligence Appraisal test, specifically The Emotional Competencies (Goleman) model.
In his first book, The Varieties of Meditative Experience (1977), republished as The Meditative Mind in 1988, Goleman used sequential chapters to describe almost a dozen different meditation systems. He wrote that "the need for the meditator to retrain his attention, whether through concentration or mindfulness, is the single invariant ingredient in the recipe for altering consciousness of every meditation system".[3]
Goleman has published a series of dialogues with More Than Sound entitled "Wired to Connect" on the applications of social intelligence. Those already published include:
A topic of his discussion with Ekman was how to empathize with others, and how we can understand other's emotions as well as our own. Goleman suggests that in light of tragedies like Hurricane Katrina, we must learn how to empathize with others in order to help them. Goleman and Ekman are both contributors to Greater Good magazine, Greater Good Science Center, University of California, Berkeley.
In 2012 Goleman published a new management training series called Leadership: A Master Class. Participants include George Kohlrieser, Howard Gardner, Warren Bennis, Daniel Siegel, Bill George, Teresa Amabile, Claudio Fernandez-Araoz, and Erica Ariel Fox.
Goleman has received many awards for his writing, including a Career Achievement award for journalism from the American Psychological Association. He was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in recognition of his efforts to communicate the behavioral sciences to the public. He is a two-time Pulitzer Prize nominee.[1]

Daniel Goleman, psychologist and award-winning author of Emotional Intelligence and other books on EI, challenges traditional measures of intelligence as a predictor of life success.
Daniel Goleman brought the notion of "EI" to prominence as an alternative to more traditional measures of IQ with his 1995 mega-best-seller Emotional Intelligence.Since the publication of that book, conferences and academic institutes have sprung up dedicated to the idea. EI is taught in public schools, and corporate leaders have adopted it as a new way of thinking about success and leadership. EI, and one's "EIQ," can be an explanation of why some "average" people are incredibly successful, while "geniuses" sometimes fail to live up to their promise.
"<em>Emotional Intelligence</em>, Goleman's highly readable and wide-ranging exploration of the best research available by modern psychologists and educators, provides important insights into the true meaning of intelligence and the qualities it encompasses." —
Psychologist Daniel Goleman (watch his TEDTalk about compassion) has just released a series of conversations about social neuroscience, empathy, compassion and social connection, each one with an expert on the topic — George Lucas on education, socially intelligent computing with Clay Shirky, Naomi Wolf on ethical leadership … The audio series is available via download […]
Many TEDTalks speakers have answered the 2008 Edge Foundation question: What have you changed your mind about? Why? Among the more than 160 essays from leading thinkers — scientists, philosophers, artists — look for Wired’s Chris Anderson, Nick Bostrom, Stewart Brand, Richard Dawkins, Aubrey de Grey, Juan Enriquez, Helen Fisher, Neil Gershenfeld, Daniel Gilbert, Daniel […]
The Harvard Business Review recently had an article called ‘The Human Moment,’ about how to make real contact with a person at work: … The fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your BlackBerry, close your laptop, end your daydream and pay full attention to the person.
There is zero correlation between IQ and emotional empathy. … They’re controlled by different parts of the brain.
There is a newly coined word in the English language for the moment when the person we’re with whips out their BlackBerry or answers that cell phone, and all of a sudden we don’t exist. The word is ‘pizzled’: it’s a combination of puzzled and pissed off.

=======================================================
Daniel Goleman lectures frequently to business audiences, professional  groups and on college campuses. A psychologist who for many years reported on  the brain and behavioral sciences for The New York Times, Dr. Goleman  previously was a visiting faculty member at Harvard.
Dr. Goleman’s most recent books are The  Brain and Emotional Intelligence: New Insights (www.MoreThanSound.net) and Leadership: The Power of Emotional  Intelligence (www.MoreThanSound.net).  In the first, he reviews recent findings from neuroscience and how they inform  our understanding of emotional intelligence. In Leadership he has collected together in a single volume his key  work on the topic from his books and articles in the Harvard Business Review.
His 1995 book Emotional Intelligence argued that human competencies  like self-awareness, self-regulation, and empathy add value to cognitive  abilities in many domains of life, from workplace effectiveness and leadership  to health and relationships; children are better prepared for life when they  are taught these emotional and social skills. Emotional Intelligence was on The New York Times bestseller list for a year-and-a-half, with  more than 5,000,000 copies in print worldwide. It has been a best seller  throughout Europe, Asia and Latin America, and was translated into nearly 30  languages.His  1998 book, Working With Emotional Intelligence (Bantam Books), argues  that workplace competencies based on emotional intelligence play a strong role  in star performance, in addition to intellect or technical skill, and that both  individuals and companies will benefit from cultivating these capabilities. His  more recent 2002 book, Primal Leadership - Realizing the Power of Emotional  Intelligence (Harvard Business School Press), was co-authored with Richard  Boyatzis and Annie McKee; it explores the crucial role of emotional  intelligence in leadership. His 2006 book Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human  Relationships (Bantam Books), explored the emerging field of social  neuroscience and its implications for better understanding interpersonal  dynamics and abilities.  From the perspective of emotional intelligence,  the book investigates the neural basis for interpersonal capacities like  empathy and social skill.  Dr. Goleman continued to explore these themes  in an audio conversation series, Wired To Connect (www.MoreThanSound.net).  When he wrote his 1995 book Emotional Intelligence (Bantam Books),  there was little neuroscientific understanding of the interpersonal realm; in  this sense Social Intelligence fills in a piece missing from the earlier book.  His 2009 book, Ecological Intelligence:  The Hidden Impacts of What We Buy combines the lenses of a new science,  industrial ecology, with psychology to delve into the human role in the  degradation of the global systems that support life, and how we could become  more effective in remedying them.
Dr. Goleman was a co-founder of the Collaborative for Academic, Social and  Emotional Learning at the Yale University Child Studies Center (now at the  University of Illinois at Chicago), with the mission to help schools introduce  emotional literacy courses. One mark of the Collaborative—and book’s—impact is  that thousands of schools around the world have begun to implement such  programs. A meta-analysis of more than 200 of these programs (published by  Roger Weissberg and Joe Durlak in Child  Development, January, 2011) shows they significantly increase proscocial  behavior, decrease antisocial behavior, and boost academic achievement.   Dr. Goleman is co-chairman of The Consortium for Research on Emotional  Intelligence in Organizations, based in the Graduate School of Applied and  Professional Psychology at Rutgers University, which seeks to catalyze research  on best practices for developing emotional competence, and the impact of  emotional intelligence in leadership and organizations. In 2003 he published Destructive  Emotions (Bantam Books), an account of a scientific dialogue between the Dalai  Lama and a group of psychologists, neuroscientists, and philosophers. He is a  member of the board of directors of the Mind & Life Institute, which  sponsors an ongoing series of such dialogues, and fosters relevant research.
Dr. Goleman has received many journalistic awards for his writing, including  two nominations for the Pulitzer Prize for his articles in the Times, and a Career Achievement award for journalism from the American Psychological  Association. In recognition of his efforts to communicate the behavioral  sciences to the public, he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for  the Advancement of Science.
Born in Stockton, California, Dr. Goleman attended Amherst College, where he  was an Alfred P. Sloan Scholar and graduated magna cum laude. His graduate  education was at Harvard, where he was a Ford Foundation Fellow, and he  received his M.A. and Ph.D. in clinical psychology and personality development.  Dr. Goleman now lives in the Berkshires of Massachusetts with his wife Tara  Bennett-Goleman, a psychotherapist. He has two grown sons and several  grandchildren.

 Author  Daniel Goleman    Related Topics: Managing Yourself,   Personal Effectiveness,   Leadership     
    Daniel Goleman has a Ph.D. in psychology from Harvard University and worked for many years as a science journalist at The New York Times. His 1995 book Emotional Intelligence was a worldwide best-seller, and his 1998 HBR article "What Makes a Leader" was picked by the editors as one of the magazine's 10 must-read articles of all time.  An advocate of empirically grounded theory and practice, Goleman is the co-director of the Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations at Rutgers University. Many organizations worldwide now recognize that emotional intelligence competencies are what distinguish outstanding leaders, and have incorporated this understanding into their strategic and human resources functions.  As a co-founder of the Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning at the University of Illinois at Chicago, Goleman has been an active advocate of school-based programs that teach the basic skills of emotional intelligence to children along with their academic lessons. Meta-analyses show these programs significantly enhance pro-social behavior, lower rates of problems like fighting and substance abuse, and heighten academic achievement scores.  Goleman's recent book, Ecological Intelligence: The Hidden Impacts of What We Buy (2009) argues that innovative information systems that offer ecological transparency regarding the environmental, health, and social impacts of goods will create a powerful market-based incentive for wide-ranging entrepreneurial innovations in sustainable methods of manufacturing and business practices.

								Daniel Goleman is an internationally known psychologist who lectures frequently to professional groups, business audiences, and on college campuses. Working as a science journalist, Goleman reported on the brain and behavioral sciences for The New York Times for many years. His 1995 book, Emotional Intelligence (Bantam Books) was on The New York Times bestseller list for a year-and-a-half; with more than 5,000,000 copies in print worldwide in 30 languages, and has been a best seller in many countries.
Daniel Goleman’s latest book, The Brain and Emotional Intelligence: New Insights, is available only in digital format. His 2009 book Ecological Intelligence: How Knowing the Hidden Impacts of What We Buy Can Change Everything argues that new information technologies will create “radical transparency,” allowing us to know the environmental, health, and social consequences of what we buy. As shoppers use point-of-purchase ecological comparisons to guide their purchases, market share will shift to support steady, incremental upgrades in how products are made – changing every thing for the better. Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships, was published in 2006. Social intelligence, the interpersonal part of emotional intelligence, can now be understood in terms of recent findings from neuroscience. Goleman’s book describes the many implications of this new science, including for altruism, parenting, love, health, learning and leadership.

A psychologist who for many years reported on the brain and behavioral sciences for The New York Times, Dr. Goleman previously was a visiting faculty member at Harvard.Dr. Golemans 1995 book, Emotional Intelligence (Bantam Books), argues that human competencies like self-awareness, self-discipline, persistence and empathy are of greater consequence than IQ in much of life, that we ignore the decline in these competencies at our peril, and that children canand shouldbe taught these abilities. Emotional Intelligence was on The New York Times bestseller list for a year-and-a-half, with more than 5,000,000 copies in print worldwide. It has been a best seller throughout Europe, Asia and Latin America, and was translated into nearly 30 languages.Dr. Goleman was a co-founder of the Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning at the Yale University Child Studies Center (now at the University of Illinois at Chicago), with the mission to help schools introduce emotional literacy courses.

=======================================================
Daniel Jay Goleman (born March 7, 1946) is an author, psychologist, and science journalist. For twelve years, he wrote for The New York Times, specializing in psychology and brain sciences. He is the author of more than 10 books on psychology, education, science, ecological crisis, and leadership. He is a two-time Pulitzer Prize nominee. 
Goleman was born in 1946 in Stockton, California, the son of Jewish college professors. He received a scholarship from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to attend Amherst College. The Amherst Independent Scholar program allowed him to transfer for his junior year to the University of California at Berkeley. He then returned to Amherst where he graduated magna cum laude. He then received a scholarship from the Ford Foundation to attend Harvard University where he received his PhD studying under David C. McClelland. He studied in India using a pre-doctoral fellowship from Harvard and a post-doctoral grant from the Social Science Research Council. He wrote his first book based on travel in India and Sri Lanka and then returned as a visiting lecturer to Harvard where during the 1970s his topic of the psychology of consciousness was popular. McClelland recommended him for a job at Psychology Today from which he was recruited by The New York Times in 1984. 
Goleman co-founded the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning at Yale University's Child Studies Center which then moved to the University of Illinois at Chicago. Currently he co-directs the Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations at Rutgers University. He sits on the board of the Mind & Life Institute. 
Goleman authored the internationally best-selling book, Emotional Intelligence (1995, Bantam Books), that spent more than one-and-a-half years on The New York Times Best Seller list. Goleman developed the argument that non-cognitive skills can matter as much as I.Q. for workplace success in Working with Emotional Intelligence (1998, Bantam Books), and for leadership effectiveness in Primal Leadership (2001, Harvard Business School Press). Goleman's most recent best-seller is Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (2006, Bantam Books). 
He developed The Emotional Intelligence Appraisal test, specifically The Emotional Competencies (Goleman) model. 
In his first book, The Varieties of Meditative Experience (1977), republished as The Meditative Mind in 1988, Goleman used sequential chapters to describe almost a dozen different meditation systems. He wrote that "the need for the meditator to retrain his attention, whether through concentration or mindfulness, is the single invariant ingredient in the recipe for altering consciousness of every meditation system". 
Goleman has published a series of dialogues with More Than Sound entitled "Wired to Connect" on the applications of social intelligence. Those already published include: 
A topic of his discussion with Ekman was how to empathize with others, and how we can understand other's emotions as well as our own. Goleman suggests that in light of tragedies like Hurricane Katrina, we must learn how to empathize with others in order to help them. Goleman and Ekman are both contributors to Greater Good magazine, Greater Good Science Center, University of California, Berkeley. 
In 2012 Goleman published a new management training series called Leadership: A Master Class. Participants include George Kohlrieser, Howard Gardner, Warren Bennis, Daniel Siegel, Bill George, Teresa Amabile, Claudio Fernandez-Araoz, and Erica Ariel Fox. 
Goleman has received many awards for his writing, including a Career Achievement award for journalism from the American Psychological Association. He was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in recognition of his efforts to communicate the behavioral sciences to the public. He is a two-time Pulitzer Prize nominee.
