Zacharías Manuel "Zack" de la Rocha (born January 12, 1970) is an American musician, poet, rapper and activist best known as the vocalist and lyricist of rap metal band Rage Against the Machine from 1991–2000, and since the band's reunion in 2007.[1][2] He left Rage Against the Machine in October 2000, and embarked on a low-key solo career. With Mars Volta drummer Jon Theodore, de la Rocha co-founded One Day as a Lion in 2008.

Zacharias Manuel de la Rocha was born in Long Beach, California on January 12, 1970, to a Mexican American father of Sephardi Jewish converso ancestry, the artist Roberto "Beto" de la Rocha (born 1942[citation needed]), and a German-Irish mother, Olivia de la Rocha (born 1942[citation needed]).[3][4] His father played an integral part in his cultural upbringing. Beto was a muralist and a member of Los Four, the first Chicano art collective to be exhibited at a museum (LACMA, 1973). De la Rocha's grandfather was a Sonorensan revolutionary born in Cananea, Mexico,[5] who fought in the Mexican Revolution and worked as an agricultural labourer in the US. Later, de la Rocha would see the hardships his grandfather endured reflected in the struggles of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation.[6]
De la Rocha's parents divorced when he was one year old, and he moved from East Los Angeles to Irvine with his mother, Olivia. Olivia attended the University of California at Irvine and ultimately earned a Ph.D. in Anthropology. De la Rocha later described Irvine as "one of the most racist cities imaginable. If you were a Mexican in Irvine, you were there because you had a broom or a hammer in your hand."[7] De la Rocha became a vegetarian as a teenager,[8] stating in 1989: "I think vegetarianism is really great, and I stand really strongly behind it...I think that an animal goes through a lot of pain in the whole cycle of death in the slaughterhouse; just living to be killed...I just don't think it's worth eating that animal...There's so much other food out there that doesn't have to involve you in that cycle of pain and death."[citation needed]
De la Rocha met Tim Commerford in elementary school, and in junior high school, they both played guitar in a band called Juvenile Expression. De la Rocha's interest in punk rock bands like The Clash, Sex Pistols, and Bad Religion turned into an appreciation for other bands like Minor Threat, Bad Brains, and The Teen Idles. In high school, he joined the straight edge band, Hardstance, which evolved into the hardcore band, Inside Out around 1988 and gained a large national underground following. The band released a single record, No Spiritual Surrender, on Revelation Records in 1990 before breaking up. De la Rocha later said that the band was "about completely detaching ourselves from society to see ourselves as...as spirits, and not bowing down to a system that sees you as just another pebble on a beach. I channeled all my anger out through that band."[9][10]
Following the dissolution of Inside Out in 1991, de la Rocha embraced hip hop and began freestyling at local clubs, at one of which he was approached by former Lock Up guitarist Tom Morello, who was impressed by de la Rocha's lyrics, and convinced him to join him in forming a band. Morello recruited former Greta drummer Brad Wilk–who had previously auditioned for Lock Up before that band's dissolution earlier that same year–and de la Rocha recruited his former Juvenile Expression bandmate, Tim Commerford, to play bass. The band was named for an unreleased Inside Out song, Rage Against the Machine.
Rage Against the Machine was on the main stage at Lollapalooza in 1993 and was one of the most politically charged bands ever to receive extensive airplay from radio and MTV. De la Rocha became one of the most visible champions of left-wing political causes around the world while advocating in favour of Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abu-Jamal, and supporting the Zapatista movement in Mexico. He spoke on the floor of the UN, testifying against the United States and its treatment of Abu-Jamal. Rage's second and third albums peaked at number one in the United States, but did not result in the political action de la Rocha had hoped for. He became increasingly restless and undertook collaborations with artists such as KRS-One, Chuck D, and Public Enemy. He left Rage Against the Machine in October 2000, citing "creative differences," at which time he issued a statement saying: "it was necessary to leave Rage because our decision-making process has completely failed",[11] in reference to the disagreement over the release of Renegades. The other members of the band sought out separate management and secured the immediate release of Renegades. After searching for a replacement for de la Rocha, the other members of Rage joined Chris Cornell of Soundgarden to form Audioslave.[12]
Following the disbandment of Rage Against the Machine, de la Rocha worked on a solo album he had been recording since before the band's dissolution, working with DJ Shadow, El-P, Muggs, Dan The Automator, Roni Size, DJ Premier, and The Roots' Questlove with production partner James Poyser.[13] The album never came to fruition, and de la Rocha started a new collaboration with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, in which around 20 tracks were produced.[14] Reznor thought the work was "excellent",[14] but said the songs will likely never be released as de la Rocha was not "ready to make a record" at that time.[15] On working with DJ Shadow and Reznor, de la Rocha admitted in a 2008 interview that:
When I left Rage... first off, I was very heartbroken, and secondly, I became obsessed with completely reinventing my wheel. In an unhealthy way, to a degree. I kind of forgot that old way of allowing yourself to just be a conduit. When I was working with Trent and Shadow, I felt that I was going through the motions. Not that what was produced wasn’t great, but I feel now that I’ve maybe reinvented the base sounds that emanate from the songs.[16]
In 2000, de la Rocha appeared on the song "Centre of the Storm", from the Roni Size/Reprazent album In The Mode,[17] while in 2002, he appeared in a minor role in the first part of the Blackalicious song "Release" on the album Blazing Arrow.[18] A new collaboration between de la Rocha and DJ Shadow, the song "March of Death" was released for free online in 2003 in protest against the imminent invasion of Iraq. As part of the collaboration de la Rocha released a statement which included the following:
Lies, sanctions, and cruise missiles have never created a free and just society. Only everyday people can do that, which is why I'm joining the millions world wide who have stood up to oppose the Bush administration's attempt to expand the U.S. empire at the expense of human rights at home and abroad. In this spirit I'm releasing this song for anyone who is willing to listen. I hope it not only makes us think, but also inspires us to act and raise our voices.[19]
The 2004 soundtrack Songs and Artists that Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11 included one of the collaborations with Reznor, "We Want It All".[14] This album also contained "No One Left", the debut recording by former Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello as The Nightwatchman. On October 7, 2005, de la Rocha returned to the stage with new material, performing with Son Jarocho band Son de Madera. He later spoke as MC and again performed with Son de Madera at the November 22 Concert at the Farm, a benefit concert for the South Central Farmers. He sang and played the jarana with the band, and performed his own new original material, including the song "Sea of Buttnuts".[20] On his post-Rage political music, de la Rocha admitted that it was near impossible for him to draw the line between politics and music:
For me, the only time that that line gets drawn when you’re producing music and you’re trying to flush out a certain idea — that’s very liberating, in a very abstract way. It’s in those moments where you feel free, and you can go ahead and explore why you feel free in those moments. In the past moments with Shadow and Trent I didn’t feel that.
Participating in the Son Jarocho work [his activist work with urban farmers in South Central Los Angeles, which included playing folk music with the group Son de Madera] felt more community based, more collective. I was part of a collective voice and not on my own as an artist, and something about that attracted me.[16]
Rumors that Rage Against the Machine could reunite at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival were circulating in mid-January 2007, and were confirmed on January 22.[21] The band was confirmed to be headlining the final day of Coachella 2007. On April 14, 2007, Morello and de la Rocha reunited on-stage early to perform a brief acoustic set at House of Blues in Chicago at the rally for fair food with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW). Morello described the event as "very exciting for everybody in the room, myself included." Rage Against the Machine, as a full band, headlined the final day of the 2007 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 29. The band played in front of a Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) backdrop to the largest crowds of the festival. The performance was initially thought to be a one-off, this turned out not to be the case. The band played 7 more shows in the United States in 2007, and in January 2008, they played their first shows outside the US as part of the Big Day Out Festival in Australia and New Zealand. The band has since continued to tour around the world, headlining many large festivals in Europe and the United States, including Lollapalooza in Chicago. At Rage's first reunion show, de la Rocha made a speech during "Wake Up" in which de la Rocha called numerous American presidents war criminals, citing a statement by Noam Chomsky regarding the Nuremberg Principles.[22] In a 2008 interview, de la Rocha said this of the relationship between him, Commerford, Wilk and Morello:
So much has changed. When you get older, you look back on tensions and grievances and have another perspective on it. I think our relationship now is better than it’s ever been. I would even describe it as great. We’re going to keep playing shows — we have a couple of big ones happening in front of both conventions. As far as us recording music in the future, I don’t know where we all fit with that. We’ve all embraced each other’s projects and support them, and that’s great.[16]
In an article published in Billboard, it was announced that work had been completed on de la Rocha's first solo album, which he had been working on at least since his departure from RATM in 2000 and, by some accounts, as early as 1995.[23] Trent Reznor, DJ Shadow, Questlove from The Roots, and El-P were said to have produced the album or portions of it. However, at this point, it seems to have been shelved indefinitely.
One Day as a Lion is a band consisting of Zack de la Rocha and former The Mars Volta drummer Jon Theodore. They added Joey Karam of The Locust on keyboards for their live shows, which were performed in July 2010. Whether Karam will remain a member of the band is uncertain. The group combines rock drumming, electro keyboards, and hip-hop vocals. De la Rocha will be playing keyboards as well as providing vocals with Theodore on the drums for their self-titled EP. The band's name derives from a black and white graffiti photograph taken by Chicano photographer George Rodriguez in 1970 with a caption reading: "It's better to live one day as a lion, than a thousand years as a lamb". They released their debut EP, One Day as a Lion, on July 22, 2008.
"Mumia 911" from Mumia 911, a benefit EP also featuring a dozen hiphop artists collectively known as The Unbound Allstars (1999)

Zack de la Rocha is one of the biggest and most well-respected names in alternative music, known equally for his militant political activism and passionate vocal delivery. In the '90s he rose to fame as frontman for Rage Against the Machine, and used that pedestal as a catalyst to further his left-wing political beliefs. To understand the motives for de la Rocha's vocal stylings, one must first trace back his philosophical roots. His story begins in Irvine, CA, during the '70s and '90s, with de la Rocha growing up as a Hispanic youth in one of the most ethnically white areas of California. His mother was an anthropology Ph.D. and his father, Belo de la Rocha, was a well-known muralist, famous for his paintings of Zapatista farmers. His parents separated at an early age and Zack split his time between his two parents. When Zack was 13 years old, his father had a nervous breakdown and subjected his son to extreme religious asceticism. Soon, he could no longer cope with his father's fanaticism and chose to move in with his mother full-time.                 
                    Within a few years, de la Rocha began to express his feelings of anger and isolation by listening to hardcore punk music, including Minor Threat, Black Flag, and Bad Religion. Before long, he had joined his first high-school band, Hardstance, where he contributed both guitars and vocals. This band later evolved into Inside Out, which would eventually release one album on Revelation Records in 1991. As he grew older, he strayed away from his rock influences and became increasingly affected by a stream of hip-hop artists, such as KRS-One and Run-D.M.C. This is about the time when he bumped into Tom Morello, a Harvard-educated political science major and kindred soul in socialist thought. The two clicked musically and intellectually and started a band together, which de la Rocha dubbed Rage Against the Machine. With a backdrop of heavy metal riffs and Morello's clever distortion techniques, de la Rocha's hip-hop-tinged vocals singed with unparalleled intensity. It wasn't long before the two were on the main stage at Lollapalooza II and became one of the most politically volatile bands ever to receive extensive radio and MTV airtime.                 
                    Soon, de la Rocha became one of the most visible champions of liberal causes around the world. The band's first video, "Freedom," was a mini-documentary about the plight of Leonard Peltier, a Native American convicted of killing two FBI agents. de la Rocha also became a prominent spokesman for the Free Mumia Abu-Jamal movement and picked up his father's cause in support of Zapatista rebels in Mexico. de la Rocha's activism took him as far as the floor of the U.N., where he testified against the United States in their treatment of Abu-Jamal. The band's music and message were so closely intertwined that de la Rocha did not consider his albums successes unless they resulted in tangible political change. Their second and third albums both peaked at number one, but the political windfall was not what he had hoped for. Increasingly restless, he embarked upon collaborative projects with KRS-One and Chuck D. By the end of 2000, de la Rocha announced that he was leaving the band.

Zacarías Manuel "Zack" de la Rocha (born January 12, 1970) is a Mexican-American[1][2] musician, poet, rapper and activist best known as the vocalist and lyricist of Rage Against the Machine.[3][4]
De la Rocha was born in Long Beach, California, to a Mexican-American father, artist Roberto "Beto" de la Rocha, and a German-Irish mother, Olivia de la Rocha. His father played an integral part in his cultural upbringing. Beto was a muralist and a member of Los Four, the first Chicano art collective to be exhibited at a museum (LACMA, 1973). De la Rocha's grandfather was a Sonorensan revolutionary born in Cananea, Sonora, Mexico,[5] who fought in the Mexican Revolution and worked as an agricultural labourer in the US. Later, de la Rocha would see the hardships his grandfather endured reflected in the struggles of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation.[6]
When de la Rocha was a year old, his parents separated. He and his mother moved from East Los Angeles to Irvine, where Olivia attended the University of California at Irvine and earned a Ph.D. in Anthropology. He later described Irvine as "one of the most racist cities imaginable. If you were a Mexican in Irvine, you were there because you had a broom or a hammer in your hand."[7] It was also at an Irvine grade school, where he met his friend and future Rage Against the Machine bandmate Tim Commerford. As a teenager, de la Rocha became a vegetarian, saying in 1989: "I think vegetarianism is really great, and I stand really strongly behind it." When asked why, he explained: "Inside me, I think that an animal goes through a lot of pain in the whole cycle of death in the slaughterhouse; just living to be killed. That whole situation is really messed up for animals, growing up in those little cooped-up pens. I just don't think it's worth eating that animal. I think animals should be free. There's so much other food out there that doesn't have to involve you in that cycle of pain and death."
While attending junior high school, de la Rocha became involved in the punk scene and played guitar for a band called Juvenile Expression with Tim Commerford. His interest in bands like The Clash, Sex Pistols, and Bad Religion turned into an appreciation for other bands like Minor Threat, Bad Brains, and The Teen Idles. Soon after entering high school, Zack joined the straight edge band Hardstance. De la Rocha and Hardstance bassist Mark Hayworth eventually formed the hardcore band Inside Out, which gained a large national underground following. They released a single record, No Spiritual Surrender, on Revelation Records in 1990 before breaking up. In de la Rocha's words, Inside Out was "about completely detaching ourselves from society to see ourselves as...as spirits, and not bowing down to a system that sees you as just another pebble on a beach. I channeled all my anger out through that band."[8][9] After Inside Out broke up, he embraced hip hop and began freestyling at local clubs, where he met Tom Morello and Brad Wilk. Eventually, de la Rocha's Juvenile Expression bandmate Commerford joined them and Rage Against the Machine was formed.
Rage Against the Machine was on the main stage at Lollapalooza in 1993 and was one of the most politically charged bands ever to receive extensive airplay from radio and MTV. De la Rocha became one of the most visible champions of left-wing political causes around the world while advocating in favour of Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abu-Jamal, and supporting the Zapatista movement in Mexico. He spoke on the floor of the UN, testifying against the United States and its treatment of Abu-Jamal. Rage's second and third albums peaked at number one in the United States, but did not result in the political action de la Rocha had hoped for. He became increasingly restless and undertook collaborations with artists such as KRS-One, Chuck D, and Public Enemy.
In October 2000, de la Rocha left Rage Against the Machine, due to "creative differences." Upon leaving the band, de la Rocha issued a statement saying: "it was necessary to leave Rage because our decision-making process has completely failed",[10] in reference to the disagreement over the release of Renegades. The other members of the band sought out separate management and secured the immediate release of Renegades. After searching for a replacement for de la Rocha, the other members of Rage joined Chris Cornell of Soundgarden to form Audioslave.
After RATM's breakup, de la Rocha worked on a solo album he had been recording since before the band's dissolution, working with DJ Shadow, El-P, Muggs, Dan The Automator, Roni Size, DJ Premier, and The Roots' Questlove with production partner James Poyser.[11] The album never came to fruition, and de la Rocha started a new collaboration with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, in which around 20 tracks were produced.[12] Reznor thought the work was "excellent",[12] but said the songs will likely never be released as de la Rocha was not "ready to make a record" at that time.[13] On working with DJ Shadow and Reznor, de la Rocha admitted in a 2008 interview that:
When I left Rage... first off, I was very heartbroken, and secondly, I became obsessed with completely reinventing my wheel. In an unhealthy way, to a degree. I kind of forgot that old way of allowing yourself to just be a conduit. When I was working with Trent and Shadow, I felt that I was going through the motions. Not that what was produced wasn’t great, but I feel now that I’ve maybe reinvented the base sounds that emanate from the songs.[14]
In 2000, de la Rocha appeared on the song "Centre of the Storm", from the Roni Size/Reprazent album In The Mode,[15] while in 2002, he appeared in a minor role in the first part of the Blackalicious song "Release" on the album Blazing Arrow.[16] A new collaboration between de la Rocha and DJ Shadow, the song "March of Death" was released for free online in 2003 in protest against the imminent invasion of Iraq. As part of the collaboration de la Rocha released a statement which included the following:
Lies, sanctions, and cruise missiles have never created a free and just society. Only everyday people can do that, which is why I'm joining the millions world wide who have stood up to oppose the Bush administration's attempt to expand the U.S. empire at the expense of human rights at home and abroad. In this spirit I'm releasing this song for anyone who is willing to listen. I hope it not only makes us think, but also inspires us to act and raise our voices.[17]
The 2004 soundtrack Songs and Artists that Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11 included one of the collaborations with Reznor, "We Want It All".[12] This album also contained "No One Left", the debut recording by former Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello as The Nightwatchman. On October 7, 2005, de la Rocha returned to the stage with new material, performing with Son Jarocho band Son de Madera. He later spoke as MC and again performed with Son de Madera at the November 22 Concert at the Farm, a benefit concert for the South Central Farmers. He sang and played the jarana[disambiguation needed] with the band, and performed his own new original material, including the song "Sea of Buttnuts".[18] On his post-Rage political music, de la Rocha admitted that it was near impossible for him to draw the line between politics and music:
For me, the only time that that line gets drawn when you’re producing music and you’re trying to flush out a certain idea — that’s very liberating, in a very abstract way. It’s in those moments where you feel free, and you can go ahead and explore why you feel free in those moments. In the past moments with Shadow and Trent I didn’t feel that.
Participating in the Son Jarocho work [his activist work with urban farmers in South Central Los Angeles, which included playing folk music with the group Son de Madera] felt more community based, more collective. I was part of a collective voice and not on my own as an artist, and something about that attracted me.[14]
Rumors that Rage Against the Machine could reunite at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival were circulating in mid-January 2007, and were confirmed on January 22.[19] The band was confirmed to be headlining the final day of Coachella 2007. On April 14, 2007, Morello and de la Rocha reunited on-stage early to perform a brief acoustic set at House of Blues in Chicago at the rally for fair food with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW). Morello described the event as "very exciting for everybody in the room, myself included." Rage Against the Machine, as a full band, headlined the final day of the 2007 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 29. The band played in front of an EZLN backdrop to the largest crowds of the festival. The performance was initially thought to be a one-off, this turned out not to be the case. The band played 7 more shows in the United States in 2007, and in January 2008, they played their first shows outside the US as part of the Big Day Out Festival in Australia and New Zealand. The band has since continued to tour around the world, headlining many large festivals in Europe and the United States, including Lollapalooza in Chicago. At Rage's first reunion show, de la Rocha made a speech during "Wake Up" in which de la Rocha called numerous American presidents war criminals, citing a statement by Noam Chomsky regarding the Nuremberg Principles.[20] In a 2008 interview, de la Rocha said this of the relationship between him, Commerford, Wilk and Morello:
So much has changed. When you get older, you look back on tensions and grievances and have another perspective on it. I think our relationship now is better than it’s ever been. I would even describe it as great. We’re going to keep playing shows — we have a couple of big ones happening in front of both conventions. As far as us recording music in the future, I don’t know where we all fit with that. We’ve all embraced each other’s projects and support them, and that’s great.[14]
In an article published in Billboard, it was announced that work had been completed on de la Rocha's first solo album, which he had been working on at least since his departure from RATM in 2000 and, by some accounts, as early as 1995.[21] Trent Reznor, DJ Shadow, Questlove from The Roots, and El-P were said to have produced the album or portions of it, however at this point it seems to have been shelved indefinitely.
One Day as a Lion is a band consisting of Zack de la Rocha and former The Mars Volta drummer Jon Theodore. They added Joey Karam of The Locust on keyboards for their live shows, which were performed in July 2010. Whether Karam will remain a member of the band is uncertain. The group combines rock drumming, electro keyboards, and hip-hop vocals. De la Rocha will be playing keyboards as well as providing vocals with Theodore on the drums for their self-titled EP. The band's name derives from an infamous black and white graffiti photograph taken by Chicano photographer George Rodriguez in 1970 with a caption reading: "It's better to live one day as a lion, than a thousand years as a lamb". They released their debut EP, One Day as a Lion, on July 22, 2008.

Under all that rage and anger is a very intelligent person who is trying to change the state of the world. Frequently described as the lead shouter, he drives the fans wild with his angry tone. He was born in Long Beach, California in 1970, and raised in Irvine by his mother. His first major band was called Inside Out. He said that (he) "channeled all my pain through that band...and not bowing down to a system that sees you as just another pebble on the beach." Zack is responsible for writing all the lyrics for Rage Against the Machine songs. Zack's parents separated when he was only one year old, his mother living in Irvine and his father in Lincoln Heights. His father, Beto De La Rocha, was a member of the Chicano art collective, called Los Four Not long after Beto De La Rocha suffered a serious mental breakdown, and he and Zack destroyed all of his paintings and work that Zack loved so much. This was especially painful for young Zack. After this ordeal, Beto became obsessively religious, locking himself out from the outside world for weeks at a time and fasting, which he forced Zack to do as well while he visited. Eventually, his behaviour was too much for Zack to take so he gradually distanced himself from his father, while still maintaining a good relationship. Zack has also revealed that his father has started to paint his pollitical paintings and write again now that he knows what his son is doing. Rage's music has actually helped Beto to regain his former identity. Zack stayed full time with his mother (of mixed heritage, who had a PhD in Anthropology) who lived in perhaps the whitest community in Southern L.A.. Being a Chicano there was not easy for Zack, where the common belief was that he had "a mop or broom in your hand or a hammer, or filled baskets of strawberries." This, along with the mental illness of his father, which caused the loss of some close ties in the Chicano community, as well as the turbulations of adolenscence gave Zack a serious culture shock. His school (University High) friend Timmy Commerford witnessed his identity crisis...The Zapatista plight has facinated Zack and he is now a memeber of the National Commission for Democracy in Mexico among others. He has organized a group of college students to visit Chiapas, Mexico, he has also given presentations to high school students and has visited Chiapas himself to lend a helping hand. Zack de la Rocha was born in Long Beach, California in 1970 and raised by his mother in Irvine, California. "In junior high I got into the Sex Pistols, Bad Religion, Social Distortion. Then I got into hardcore at sixteen, seventeen. Hardcore was the whole expression of my being: Minor Threat, Bad Brains, Teen Idles, State Of Alert with Henry Rollins." "I lived [in Irvine], but I never felt totally accepted as one of these rich white suburban kids. I wasn't economically deprived like so many of my Chicano brothers and sisters, but I felt the tension and the rejection--and that's when I started getting into hip-hop, started break-dancing. `The Message,' `Rapper's Delight,' Run-DMC...that was what was happening around that time." "Inside Out was the first band I ever fronted. I channeled all my pain through that band. It was about completely detaching ourselves from society to see ourselves as...as spirits, and not bowing down to a syste m that sees you as just another pebble on a beach. But Inside Out went through were a ton of lineup changes."
is the guitarist of RATM. Often regarded as a guitar genius, Morello adds strage new sounds to Rage songs that definitely add an edge. He is also thought by some people as one of the best guitarists today, one reveiw saying he was "doing the work of two turntables". He was born in New York city in 1964 and grew up in Libertyville, Illionois. His father was a member of the Mau Mau guerilla army which freed Kenya from British rule. His mother was the founding member of the group "Parents for Rock & Rap", an anti-censorship organization and has taught U.S. military members in school. He has also worked with Adam Jones of Tool. Tom's mom, at Lollapalooza introduced Rage as "the best fucking band on the tour." I wholly agree with her. His parents separated early in his life on good terms, and Morello went on to recieve a degree from the prestigious Harvard University in Political Sciences with honours. He is probably best known for his revolutionary guitar work on their second album, Evil Empire and said that he just wants to pick up a really crappy guitar from the wall and see what sounds it makes. He, with his uncanny political knowledge, and De La Rocha's anger and storminess make them a formidable pair. Just another note, Tom was the secretary of senator Alan Cranston, and left his position after some lady called up and told him that she was upset that coloured people were moving in to her town. He said that she was the problem and she was unknowingly racist, which put him under fire from his superiors.
Tom entered Harvard University in 1982, was active in the campaign for university divestment from South Africa, and graduated with honors in 1986. "I lived in Libertyville for 18 years, and in the whole town there were maybe three or four other blacks and an equal number of Asians. My mom used to play the Temptations, War, and James Brown at home. I got a guitar when I was 13 or 14, and I was determined to become Jimmy Page or Ace Frehley of KISS. But I got disenchanted with taking lessons and stopped playing for four years. I didn't pick it up again until I heard the Sex Pistols album. Seeing the Clash in Chicago was a life-changing experience. They were more powerful than any band I'd ever seen because of the conviction, the realness behind it." "My Harvard friends went on to become professors, doctors, lawyers, bankers. They had a difficult time understanding why I wanted to be a socialist rock musician. My musician friends had the opposite problem...In `86, I moved to Los Angeles. The glam scene was in full effect--I was appalled! In `88 I joined Lock Up. We made a n album for Geffen, toured, eventually broke up. I met Brad Wilk when he auditioned for Lock Up, and he and I had a great playing chemistry together. He was the first guy I called when I left the band. We started auditioning a lot of people, looking for the right chemistry, while I taught guitar to support myself." "Rage heightens the contradictions: in the intensity of the live show, in the brutality of the music, in the content of the lyrics. It's a political assault which might force you to consider the ideas that are put forward."
Brad Wilk: is the drummer. He was born in Portland, Oregon, in 1969, lived in Chicago for a while, then settled in Southern California. He listened to Led Zeppelin, the Who, and John Bonham before he heard the Sex Pistols, which changed him. He is still coming to terms with his father's death just before Rage's tour with Lollapalooza (on which they went on stage, naked for 15 minutes, with electric tape over their mouths to protest censorship). Brad also saw money ruin his father just before his death and made him appreciate the few things that don't cost money. Zack may be known as the stormy frontman, Tom as the extremely intelligent left-wing extremist, but its Brad who has the heart. "I really wish I could be a fucking asshole sometimes" he said to Ray Gun magazine, since he is always looking at everybody elses feelings and how it is going to affect them. Its basically tradition that the drummer of each band has the best well-rounded personality. He's really in the band for the music instead of the politics, although Tom and Zack have really opened his eyes. He finished off with "...-this sounds really stupid and basic, but people want to be rocked. You know? As simple and stupid as that sounds, I think there's a whole lot of truth behind it. They came to be rocked," he pauses, amused at the inevitable conclusion. "And we will rock you."
Timmy Commerford: aka Tim Bob plays the bass. His skills and the crushing power of his bass playing are evident in the song "bullet in the head" and "Clear the Lane.". He listens to Inside Out, Zack's former band and the Bad Brains. Rage's first gig ever was in the living room of one of Tim C.'s friends, which showed them that they were on to something. Somewhat more interesting is that Zack introduced Tim to the bass. Timmy's father is an aeronautics/space engineer, his mom was a mathematician until brain cancer got the better of her. By the time Tim was in the third grade, his mom couldn't even understand the math problems he was bringing home from school. Because this disease made life miserable for the family, Tim's dad divorced her and remarried. His mom went to live with one of his sisters in Sacremento. From there the family fell apart. Tim vents his anger through poetry, art and music, but this reveals a darker side which Tim isn't comfortable with. "I have alot of anger towards certain things - for example the police. I understand what they're all about and I don't like what they do to people, and I draw pictures of what I would like to do to them. And it's not good things. It's mean, horrible things...Someday I'll display my art for people to see, but right now it just kind of scares me." Tim's, Zack's, Brad's and Tom's anger all boil up to confilicting ideas which caused the band to fight violently among themselves, some reports saying that it got physical at one point. The band broke up in `94 for many months, regrouping for the KROQ weenie-roast. Tim finished off his interview with "...And I'm kinda leaning more and more towards the philosophy that, okay, Rage Against the Machine is something different that music. Its an educational thing." Oh yeah, some of you may be wondering why his name is Tim Bob on this album. Well, he revealed to the LA Times that he was going to change his name for each album...we can just hope there will be more...

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Zack De La Rocha was born on January 12, 1970 in Long Beach, California, USA as Zacarias Manuel De La Rocha.
      The lead singer of the band Rage Against the Machine. De la Rocha left the band in 2001 after he felt "they weren't taking enough musical risks." His bandmates later formed Audioslave with Chris Cornell. After Audioslave disbanded in 2007, Rage Against the Machine was revived and de la Rocha rejoined the band.
      Vocalist and keyboardist of the alternative rap duo One Day as a Lion, featuring former The Mars Volta drummer Jon Theodore.
      Touring with the re-formed 'Rage Against The Machine', having just finished the Big Day Out festival concerts in Australia and New Zealand. [March 2008]
      There are many Sheriff Arpaios. People who have taken to local city, county, and state governments across the county the idea that immigrants are the problem. That immigrants are to blame.
      I'm in this band to give volume to various struggles throughout the world. To me, the tension in this band is a minimal sacrifice.
      Governor Jan Brewer and the Arizona legislature have created an environment in Arizona where performing is no longer a neutral act. They have created an environment where they can convert the normal commercial interaction between artists and their fans into the means to apply this racist law.
      One of the great things about young people is that they do question, that they do care deeply about justice, and they they have open minds.
