Paul David Hewson (born 10 May 1960), known by his stage name Bono (/ˈbɒnoʊ/), is an Irish singer-songwriter, musician, venture capitalist, businessman, and philanthropist.[2] He is best recognized as the frontman of the Dublin-based rock band U2. Bono was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland, and attended Mount Temple Comprehensive School where he met his future wife, Alison Stewart, and the future members of U2.[3][4][5] Bono writes almost all U2 lyrics, frequently using religious, social, and political themes.[6][7] During U2's early years, Bono's lyrics contributed to their rebellious and spiritual tone.[6] As the band matured, his lyrics became inspired more by personal experiences shared with the other members.[4][6]
Outside the band, he has collaborated and recorded with numerous artists,[8][9][10] is managing director and a managing partner of Elevation Partners,[11] and has refurbished and owns The Clarence Hotel in Dublin with The Edge.[12][13] Bono is also widely known for his activism concerning Africa, for which he co-founded DATA, EDUN, the ONE Campaign and Product Red.[4][14] He has organised and played in several benefit concerts and has met with influential politicians.[14][15][16] Bono has been praised and criticised for his activism and involvement with U2.[17][18][19] He was granted a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, and, with Bill and Melinda Gates, was named Time Person of the Year in 2005,[17][20][21] among other awards and nominations. On 17 July 2013, the BBC announced that Bono had been made a Commandeur of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Order of Arts and Letters).
Bono was born in the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, on 10 May 1960.[22] He was raised in the Northside suburb of Finglas[1] with his brother, Norman Robert Hewson (who is eight years older than Bono), by their mother, Iris (née Rankin), a member of the Church of Ireland, and their father, Brendan Robert "Bob" Hewson, a Roman Catholic.[3][4] His parents initially agreed that the first child would be raised Anglican and the second Catholic.[23] Although Bono was the second child, he also attended Church of Ireland services with his mother and brother.[23]
He went to the local primary Glasnevin National School.[24] Bono was 14 when his mother died on 10 September 1974 after suffering a cerebral aneurysm at her father's funeral.[4] Many U2 songs, including "I Will Follow", "Mofo", "Out of Control", "Lemon" and "Tomorrow" focus on the loss of his mother.[4][25][26]
Bono attended Mount Temple Comprehensive School, a multi denominational school in Clontarf. During his childhood and adolescence, Bono and his friends were part of a surrealist street gang called "Lypton Village". Bono met one of his closest friends, Guggi, in Lypton Village.[27] The gang had a ritual of nickname-giving. Bono had several names: first, he was "Steinhegvanhuysenolegbangbangbang",[27] then just "Huyseman", followed by "Houseman", "Bon Murray", "Bono Vox of O'Connell Street", and finally just "Bono".[4] "Bono Vox" is an alteration of Bonavox, a Latin phrase which translates to "good voice". It is said he was nicknamed "Bono Vox" by his friend Gavin Friday. He initially disliked the name; however, when he learned it translated to "good voice", he accepted it. Hewson has been known as "Bono" since the late 1970s. Although he uses Bono as his stage name, close family and friends also refer to him as Bono, including fellow band members.[4]
After he left school, his father Bob Hewson, told him he could live at home for one year but if he was not able to pay his own way, he would have to leave the house.[27]
Bono is married to Alison Hewson (née Stewart).[5] The couple have four children: daughters Jordan (born 10 May 1989) and Memphis Eve (7 July 1991) and sons Elijah Bob Patricius Guggi Q (17 August 1999) and John Abraham (20 May 2001).[28]
[I have] very sensitive eyes to light. If somebody takes my photograph, I will see the flash for the rest of the day. My right eye swells up. I've a blockage there, so that my eyes go red a lot. So it's part vanity, it's part privacy and part sensitivity.[29]
In 2002, he was listed as one of the 100 Greatest Britons in a poll conducted among the general public,[30] despite the fact he is Irish. In May 2010, Bono suffered a spinal injury while preparing for a U2 tour, and was taken to a German clinic in Munich for emergency neurosurgery.[31][32] The North American leg of the tour was postponed and rescheduled for 2011.[33][34] In 2004, Bono was given an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Pennsylvania.[35] Bono was named one of the 17 Irish artists to be proud of by the Irish Post on 9 April 2013.[36] Time magazine ranked him at the 8th place on its list of the "Most Influential Celebrities" in 2013; he was the only person from the music industry in the Top 10.[37]
In the late 1980s or early '90s, Bono bought a top-floor duplex apartment in Manhattan's San Remo apartment building from Steve Jobs for $15 million. Jobs had had it renovated for his own use, but never moved in.[38]
Bono's work as an activist, which is due largely to his Christian beliefs,[39] began in earnest when, inspired by Live Aid, he travelled to Ethiopia to work in a feeding camp with his wife Alison and the charity World Vision, an Evangelical Christian humanitarian aid, development, and advocacy organisation.[40] With regard to Bono's 2013 declarations in interviews published and videotaped of his faith in Jesus Christ,[41] he states that Christ was either who he said he was, or he is "a complete and utter nut case".[42][43] As early as 2005, Bono was invoking this argument,[44][45] identified as the "Lewis trilemma". Bono's variant of the trilemma stemmed from the theological outline C.S. Lewis is well-known to have used to prove the divinity of Jesus.
On 25 September 1976, Bono, David Evans ("The Edge"), his brother Dik and Adam Clayton responded to an advertisement on a bulletin board at Mount Temple posted by fellow student Larry Mullen Jr. to form a rock band. The band had occasional jam sessions in which they did covers of other bands. Tired of long guitar solos and hard rock, Bono wanted to play Rolling Stones and Beach Boys songs. Unfortunately the band could not play covers very well, so they started writing their own songs.
The band went by the name "Feedback" for a few months, before changing to "The Hype" later on. After Dik Evans left the group to join another local band, the Virgin Prunes, the remaining four officially changed the name from "The Hype" to "U2". Initially Bono sang, played guitar and wrote the band's songs. He said of his early guitar playing in a 1982 interview, "When we started out I was the guitar player, along with the Edge—except I couldn't play guitar. I still can't. I was such a lousy guitar player that one day they broke it to me that maybe I should sing instead. I had tried before, but I had no voice at all. I remember the day I found I could sing. I said, 'Oh, that's how you do it.'".[46] When The Edge's guitar playing improved, Bono was relegated mostly to the microphone, although he occasionally still plays rhythm guitar and harmonica. As of 2006, Bono has taken piano lessons from his children's piano teacher as a means to improve his songwriting.[47]
Bono writes the lyrics for almost all U2 songs, which are often rich in social and political themes.[6] His lyrics frequently allude to a religious connection or meaning, evident in songs such as "Gloria" from the band's album October and "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" from The Joshua Tree.[7] During the band's early years, Bono was known for his rebellious tone which turned to political anger and rage during the band's War, The Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum eras.[6] Following the Enniskillen bombing that left 11 dead and 63 injured on 8 November 1987, the Provisional IRA paramilitaries threatened to kidnap Bono.[4] IRA supporters also attacked a vehicle carrying the band members.[4] These acts were in response to his speech condemning the Remembrance Day Bombing during a live performance of "Sunday Bloody Sunday".[4] The singer had been advised to cut his on-stage outburst from the Rattle and Hum film, but it was left in.[48] Also featured in the film is footage of Bono spray-painting a monument during an outdoor performance; Bono was forced to pay a fine.
U2's sound and focus dramatically changed with their 1991 album, Achtung Baby. Bono's lyrics became more personal, inspired by experiences related to the private lives of the members of the band.[4][6] During the band's Zoo TV Tour several of his stage personas were showcased; these included "The Fly", a stereotypical rock star, the "Mirror Ball Man", a parody of American televangelists, and "Mr. MacPhisto", a combination of a corrupted rock star and the Devil.[4][6]
During performances he attempts to interact with the crowd as often as possible and is known for pulling audience members onto the stage or moving himself down to the physical level of the audience.[4] This has happened on several occasions including at the Live Aid concert in 1985 where he leapt off the stage and pulled a woman from the crowd to dance with her as the band played "Bad", and in 2005 during U2's Vertigo Tour stop in Chicago, where he pulled a boy onto the stage during the song "An Cat Dubh / Into the Heart".[4][49] Bono has often allowed fans to come on stage and perform songs with the band.
Bono has won numerous awards with U2, including 22 Grammy awards and the 2003 Golden Globe award for best original song, "The Hands That Built America", for the film Gangs of New York.[18][50] During the live broadcast of the ceremony, Bono called the award "really, really fucking brilliant!".[51] In response, the Parents Television Council condemned Bono for his profanity and started a campaign for its members to file complaints with the FCC.[52] Although Bono's use of "fuck" violated FCC indecency standards, the FCC refused to fine NBC because the network did not receive advance notice of the consequences of broadcasting such profanity and the profanity in question was not used in its literal sexual meaning.[53]
In 2005, the U2 band members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in their first year of eligibility.[54] In November 2008, Rolling Stone ranked Bono the 32nd-greatest singer of all time.[55]
Bono and his bandmates were criticised in 2007 for moving part of their multi-million euro song catalogue from Ireland to Amsterdam six months before Ireland ended a tax exemption on musicians' royalties.[19][56] Under Dutch tax law, bands are subject to low to non-existent tax rates.[19] U2's manager, Paul McGuinness, stated that the arrangement is legal and customary and businesses often seek to minimise their tax burdens.[19] The move prompted criticisms in the Irish parliament.[57][58] The band later responded by stating that approximately 95% of their business took place outside Ireland, and that they were taxed globally because of this.[59] Bono was one of several super-rich figures whose tax arrangements were singled out for criticism in a report by the charity Christian Aid in 2008.[60]
In addition to his work with U2, he has collaborated with Frank Sinatra,[8] Johnny Cash,[9] Willie Nelson,[61] Luciano Pavarotti,[62] Sinéad O'Connor,[63] Green Day, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison,[64] Bob Dylan,[10] Tina Turner,[65] B.B. King and Zucchero.[66][67][68] He has recorded with Ray Charles,[69] Quincy Jones, Kirk Franklin,[70] Bruce Springsteen,[71] Tony Bennett,[72] Clannad,[73] The Corrs,[74] Wyclef Jean,[75] Kylie Minogue,[76] Carl Perkins,[77] Jay-Z and Rihanna, as well as reportedly completing an unreleased duet with Jennifer Lopez.[78] On Robbie Robertson's 1987 eponymous album, he plays bass guitar and vocals.[79] On Michael Hutchence's 1999 posthumous eponymous album, Bono completed a recording of "Slide Away" as a duet with Hutchence.[80]
Bono and The Edge also wrote the music and lyrics for the Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark. On 25 May 2011, a single titled "Rise Above 1" by Reeve Carney featuring Bono and The Edge was released digitally.[81] The music video was released on 28 July 2011.[82]
Bono has a wide tenor vocal range since the beginning of the band. His highest note was reached in 1984 in the studio version of "Bad", recording a C♯5, like in the song "Love Rescues Me"; however, his most notable reached note was a B5, which can be in songs like "Pride (In the Name of Love)", "I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight", "Magnificent", "Vertigo" and "Ultraviolet".
Nowadays, he can reach a C5 (his can be heard in the current version of "Bad", due to the fact that they lowered the song one semitone). Bono is also characterized by his use of falsetto, reaching a G6 in a live version of "One" in the 90s. He has also reached Pavarotti's notes in "Miss Sarajevo" during Vertigo Tour and in 2010 during U2 360° Tour, reaching a G♯5. Bono's vocal range in live performances between 1984 and 2010 was from C#2 to G#5,[83]
Bono has become one of the world's best-known philanthropic performers and was named the most politically effective celebrity of all time by the National Journal.[87][88][89] He has been dubbed, "the face of fusion philanthropy",[90] both for his success enlisting powerful allies from a diverse spectrum of leaders in government, religious institutions, philanthropic organisations, popular media, and the business world, as well as for spearheading new organizational networks that bind global humanitarian relief with geopolitical activism and corporate commercial enterprise.[91]
In a 1986 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Bono explained that he was motivated to become involved in social and political causes by seeing one of the Secret Policeman's Ball benefit shows, staged by John Cleese and producer Martin Lewis for the human-rights organisation Amnesty International in 1979.[92] "I saw 'The Secret Policeman’s Ball' and it became a part of me. It sowed a seed...". In 2001, Bono arranged for U2 to videotape a special live performance for that year's Amnesty benefit show.
In 1984, Bono sang on the Band Aid single "Do They Know it's Christmas?/Feed the World" (a role that was reprised on the 2004 Band Aid 20 single of the same name).[93] Geldof and Bono later collaborated to organise the 2005 Live 8 project, where U2 also performed.[16] Bono and U2 performed on Amnesty's Conspiracy Of Hope tour of the United States in 1986 alongside Sting.[15] U2 also performed in the Band Aid and Live Aid projects, organised by Bob Geldof.[94]
Since 1999, Bono has become increasingly involved in campaigning for third-world debt relief and raising awareness of the plight of Africa, including the AIDS pandemic. In the past decade Bono has met with several influential politicians, including former United States President George W. Bush and former Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin.[95] During a March 2002 visit to the White House, after President Bush unveiled a $5 billion aid package, he accompanied the President for a speech on the White House lawn where he stated, "This is an important first step, and a serious and impressive new level of commitment. "...This must happen urgently, because this is a crisis.".[95] In May of that year, Bono took US Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill on a four-country tour of Africa. In contrast, in 2005, Bono spoke on CBC Radio, alleging then Prime Minister Martin was being slow about increasing Canada's foreign aid.[96]
In 2004, he was awarded the Pablo Neruda International Presidential Medal of Honour from the Government of Chile.[97] Time Magazine named Bono one of the "100 Most Influential People" in its May 2004 special issue[98] and again in the 2006 Time 100 special issue.[99] In 2005, Time, named Bono, with Bill and Melinda Gates, a Person of the Year.[21] Also in 2005, he received the Portuguese Order of Liberty for his humanitarian work.[100] That year Bono was also among the first three recipients of the TED Prize, which grants each winner "A wish to change the world".[101] Bono made three wishes,[102] the first two related to the ONE campaign and the third that every hospital, health clinic and school in Ethiopia should be connected to the Internet. TED rejected the third wish as being a sub-optimal way for TED to help Africa[102] and instead organised a TED conference in Arusha, Tanzania. Bono attended the conference, which was held in June 2007.
In 2005 he recorded a version of "Don't Give Up" with Alicia Keys, with proceeds going to Keep a Child Alive.[103] On 3 April 2005, Bono paid a personal tribute to John Paul II and called him "a street fighter and a wily campaigner on behalf of the world's poor. We would never have gotten the debts of 23 countries completely cancelled without him.".[104] Bono spoke in advance of President Bush at the 54th Annual National Prayer Breakfast, held at the Hilton Washington Hotel on 2 February 2006. In a speech containing biblical references, Bono encouraged the care of the socially and economically depressed. His comments included a call for an extra one percent tithe of the United States' national budget. He brought his Christian views into harmony with other faiths by noting that Christian, Jewish, and Muslim writings all call for the care of the widow, orphan, and stranger. President Bush received praise from the singer-activist for the United States' increase in aid for the African continent. Bono continued by saying much work is left to be done to be a part of God's ongoing purposes.[14]
Also in 2005, Bono, Ali Hewson and designer Rogan Gregory co-founded the Edun fashion label ("nude" spelled backwards, to suggest both "natural" and the Garden of Eden).[105] It was intended to help bring about positive change in Africa through a fair trade-based relationship rather than by direct aid.[106][107]
On 15 December 2005, Paul Theroux published an op-ed in the New York Times called The Rock Star's Burden (cf. Kipling's The White Man's Burden) that criticised stars such as Bono, Brad Pitt, and Angelina Jolie, labelling them as "mythomaniacs, people who wish to convince the world of their worth.". Theroux, who lived in Africa as a Peace Corps Volunteer, added that "the impression that Africa is fatally troubled and can be saved only by outside help—not to mention celebrities and charity concerts—is a destructive and misleading conceit.".[108] Elsewhere, Bono has been criticised, along with other celebrities, for "[ignoring] the legitimate voices of Africa and [turning] a global movement for justice into a grand orgy of narcissistic philanthropy".[109]
In 2007, Bono was named in the UK's New Years Honours List as an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire.[20][110] He was formally granted knighthood on 29 March 2007 in a ceremony at the residence of British Ambassador David Reddaway in Dublin, Ireland.[111]
Bono also received the NAACP Image Award's Chairman's Award in 2007.[112] On 24 May 2007, the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia announced that Bono would receive the Philadelphia Liberty Medal on 27 September 2007 for his work to end world poverty and hunger.[113] On 28 September 2007, in accepting the Liberty Medal, Bono said, "When you are trapped by poverty, you are not free. When trade laws prevent you from selling the food you grew, you are not free ... When you are a monk in Burma this very week, barred from entering a temple because of your gospel of peace ... well, then none of us are truly free". Bono donated the $100,000 prize to the organisation. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala accepted the award for the Washington-based Debt AIDS Trade Africa.[114]
The organisation DATA (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa) was established in 2002 by Bono and Bobby Shriver, along with activists from the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt Campaign.[115] DATA aims to eradicate poverty and HIV/AIDS in Africa.[115] DATA encourages Americans to contact senators and other legislators and elected officials to voice their opinions.[115]
Bono was a special guest editor of the July 2007 issue of Vanity Fair magazine. The issue was named "The Africa Issue: Politics & Power" and featured an assortment of 20 different covers, with photographs by Annie Leibovitz of a number of prominent celebrities, political leaders, and philanthropists. Each one showcased in the issue for their contributions to the humanitarian relief in Africa.[116]
In an article in Bloomberg Markets in March 2007, journalists Richard Tomlinson and Fergal O'Brien noted that Bono used his band's 2006 Vertigo world tour to promote his ONE Campaign while at the same time "U2 was racking up $389 million in gross ticket receipts, making Vertigo the second-most lucrative tour of all time, according to Billboard magazine ... Revenue from the Vertigo tour is funnelled through companies that are mostly registered in Ireland and structured to minimise taxes.".[117]
Further criticism came in November 2007, when Bono's various charity campaigns were targeted by Jobs Selasie, head of African Aid Action. Selasie claimed that these charities had increased corruption and dependency in Africa because they failed to work with African entrepreneurs and grassroots organisations, and as a result, Africa has become more dependent on international handouts.[118] Bono responded to his critics in Times Online on 19 February 2006, calling them "cranks carping from the sidelines. A lot of them wouldn’t know what to do if they were on the field. They’re the party who will always be in opposition so they’ll never have to take responsibility for decisions because they know they’ll never be able to implement them.".[119]
In November 2007, Bono was honoured by NBC Nightly News as someone "making a difference" in the world.[120] He and anchor Brian Williams had travelled to Africa in May 2007 to showcase the humanitarian crisis on the continent.[121] On 11 December 2008, Bono was given the annual Man of Peace prize, awarded by several Nobel Peace Prize laureates in Paris, France.[122]
Product Red is another initiative begun by Bono and Bobby Shriver to raise money for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.[123] Bobby Shriver has been announced as the CEO of Product Red, whilst Bono is currently an active public spokesperson for the brand. Product Red is a brand that is licensed to partner companies, such as American Express, Apple, Converse, Motorola, Microsoft, Dell, The Gap and Giorgio Armani.[124] Each company creates a product with the Product Red logo and a percentage of the profits from the sale of these labelled products will go to the Global Fund.[125]
Bono is the subject of The Front Man, a book which criticises his embrace of capitalism and neoliberalism.
In 1992, Bono, along with the Edge, bought and refurbished Dublin's two-star 70-bedroom Clarence Hotel, and converted it into a five-star 49-bedroom hotel.[13] The Edge and Bono have recorded several songs together, exclusive of the band. They also worked on the score for the 2011 rock musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.[126]
In May 2007, MTV reported that Bono was writing the foreword for a collection of poetry entitled "Third Rail".[127] The book's foreword details the meanings of its poetry, stating "The poets who fill the pews here have come to testify, to bear witness to the mysterious power of rock and roll...Rock and roll is truly a broad church, but each lights a candle to their vision of what it is.".[127] The collection, edited by poet Jonathan Wells, contains titles such as "Punk rock You're My Big Crybaby", "Variation on a Theme by Whitesnake" and "Vince Neil Meets Josh in a Chinese Restaurant in Malibu (After Ezra Pound).".[127]
Bono is on the board of the Elevation Partners private-equity firm, which attempted to purchase Eidos Interactive in 2005 and has since gone on to invest in other entertainment businesses.[12][128] Bono has invested in the Forbes Media group in the US through Elevation Partners. Elevation Partners became the first outsider to invest in the company, taking a minority stake in Forbes Media LLC, a new company encompassing the 89-year-old business which includes Forbes magazine, the Forbes.com website and other assets. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but reports said the stake was worth about €194 million ($250m).[129][130][131] The firm also owns a 1.5% stake in social networking site Facebook, originally purchased for $210m.[11] Bono's stake was valued at approximately US$ 1 billion in February 2012.[132]
In addition to his acting credits Bono has contributed music to films, as part of U2 and other collaborations. In Across the Universe he sang The Beatles songs "I Am the Walrus" and "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds".

With his soaring voice, larger-than-life personality, and ostentatious stage performances — he has climbed the scaffolding at concerts and assumed alter egos like the Fly and Mirror Ball Man — Bono not only helped steer the course for post-Eighties rock & roll, but also became pop music's global ambassador. Away from the studio and stage, the U2 frontman has helped raise awareness of social causes ranging from world hunger and AIDS to third-world debt relief. He's met with and won the praises of world leaders from George W. Bush to the presidents of Argentina, Brazil and France. He's been granted knighthood and nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. And he's become a formidable entrepreneur as co-founder of the private equity firm Elevations Partners.
He was born Paul David Hewson on May 10, 1960, in Dublin, Ireland, and raised along with a brother in the neighborhood of Glasnevi. His mother was a Protestant and his father a Catholic. Hewson initially went to a Catholic grammar school but later attended the progressive nondenominational Mount Temple High School. When he was 14 his mother died of a brain aneurysm. By then Hewson had become part of a group of teens, including singer Gavin Friday, who formed a fantasy world called Lypton Village for which they gave themselves nicknames. 
Hewson was christened Bono Vox (Latin for good voice), from the name of a local hearing aid shop. In 1975, he began dating Alison Stewart (the couple would marry in 1982, eventually having two girls and two boys). In 1976 he responded to 14-year-old drummer Larry Mullen's ad for band members, and the seeds of U2 were planted; within four years the band, by then inspired by the sounds of such punk and postpunk acts as Siouxie and the Banshees and Joy Division, would sign to Island and begin work on their 1980 debut Boy. Meanwhile, Bono other members of Lypton Village had become involved in a Bible study group, which informed much of the band's early music, particularly songs like "Gloria," from its second album, October, in 1981.
Increasingly, Bono's lyrics integrated his spiritual beliefs with social and political themes, and by the time of 1983's critical and commercial breakthrough, War (Number 12) — with its anthem-like singles and the MTV staples "New Year's Day" (Number Two) and "Sunday Bloody Sunday" (Number Seven) — he was being hailed as a rock & roll crusader. Bono continued in that earnestly passionate vein through several U2 albums including The Unforgettable Fire (Number 12, 1984), The Joshua Tree (Number One, 1987) and Rattle & Hum (Number One, 1988). 
But by the early 1990s, Bono, teetering on the brink of self-parody, began to assume new characters in U2's music and stage performances. On Achtung Baby (Number One, 1991), U2 added elements of industrial and dance music, and during the band's Zoo TV tour in support of the album, Bono appeared onstage as the Fly, a parody of the arrogant rock star, and Mirror Ball Man, which mocked televangelists. Bono's newfound irony continued on Zooropa (Number One, 1993) and the long-awaited Pop (Number One, 1997), which added techno-disco textures to the band's sound. 
By then, though, critics had soured on Bono's reinventions of himself, and the album received lukewarm reviews. Bono himself expressed dissatisfaction with the album, and the band came back three years later with the critically acclaimed Number Three album All That You Can't Leave Behind, on which Bono was back to his optimistic, anthemic self on the single "Beautiful Day" (Number 21, 2000).
By the late 1990s, Bono began spending more of his time on his philanthropic ventures. He had been motivated to use his star power after seeing a Secret Policeman's Ball benefit show for Amnesty International in 1979, and during the Eighties U2 performed at a number of major benefits including Band Aid, Live Aid and Amnesty International's Conspiracy of Hope tour. 
But in 1999, he stepped up his activism, tirelessly campaigning for third-world debt relief and shining a light on poverty and the AIDS pandemic in Africa. In 2002 he accompanied President Bush during his White House lawn speech on the U.S.'s commitment to Africa. Bono also accompanied dignitaries on a trip to the African continent and criticized world leaders who were late to the cause. In 2004 he cofounded the ONE campaign along with eleven major humanitarian groups advocating on behalf of children, world hunger and medical aid. In 2005 he and Band Aid/Live Aid organizer Bob Geldof teamed up to present the Live 8 concerts calling attention to the G8 Conference and summit that year in Scotland. From 2003 to 2010, Bono won numerous accolades for his humanitarian work including three Nobel Peace Prize nominations; in 2004, the government of Chile awarded him the Pablo Neruda International Presidential Medal of Honor.
Bono's humanitarian work has not gone without criticism. Some observers have called his philanthropic zeal narcissistic; a writer and former Peace Corps volunteer penned a scathing 2005 opinion piece for The New York Times, suggesting the attention that Bono and other celebrities get for their causes is harmful, creating the impression that complex world problems can be easily fixed. That same year Bono drew some ire from his left-leaning supporters when he became a major business mogul, cofounding Elevation Partners to invest in entertainment and media businesses, one being the Forbes Media group, another being a company that makes war-simulation video games. In 2007 he and U2 were criticized for moving part of their song catalog out of Ireland after the government stopped giving tax breaks to musicians' royalties.
Meanwhile, Bono continued recording and touring with U2 in the first decade of the 2000s, releasing two more chart-toppers: How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004) and No Line on the Horizon (2009).

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Born Paul David Hewson in Dublin, Ireland on May 10, 1960 Bono has been the lead singer of the rock band U2 since 1976. U2 has won 22 Grammy Awards to date, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. Lauded by fans and critics as an outstanding performer and songwriter, Bono has also been praised by world leaders as an accomplished activist due to his powers of persuasion and knowledge of the issues. He travels extensively to give speeches and lobby politicians. Bono's career as a socially conscious musician has been shaped by childhood experiences in Ireland as well as volunteer work in Africa and South America. He married his childhood sweetheart Ali Hewson in 1982. An accomplished activist in her own right, Ali Hewson once declined an invitation to run for President of Ireland because her husband "would not move to a smaller house". They live in Dublin with their four children: Jordan, Memphis Eve, Elijah Bob Patricius Guggi Q and John Abraham.Bono was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003 for his successful efforts to relieve third world debt and promote AIDS awareness in Africa. He received the rank of Chevalier dans I'Ordre de la Legion d'Honneur (Knight in the Order of the Legion of Honor) from French President Jacques Chirac on February 28, 2003.
      At one point in in their career, less than ten paying customers were on hand for a U2 show. In the early 1990s, U2 was the biggest export in all of Ireland.
Luciano Pavarotti called Bono's father relentlessly, so that he would try and convince his son to write a song for him.
      He has written songs either for, or with, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Cash, Keith Richards, Luciano Pavarotti, Sinéad O'Connor and Howie B. among several others.
      Wrote the song "The Sweetest Thing" after missing his wife's birthday. When the song was rerecorded, his wife, Ali Hewson, received all the proceeds of its sale. She gave them, in turn to a charity for victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
      Wife Alison gave birth to their 4th child, John Abraham Hewson, 7 lbs 7 oz, in Dublin Ireland. Now has two daughters and two sons. [May 2001]

      Was one of the keynote speakers at Liberal Party of Canada's Leadership Convention in November 2003, where Paul Martin was elected as Liberal Party leader and Prime Minister of Canada.
      Sings the line 'well tonight, thank God it's them, instead of you' in the Band Aid 20 2004 cover of "Do They Know It's Christmas", the exact same line he sang on the original version back in 1984.
      Along with his wife Ali Hewson and New York designer Rogan, he created the high-fashion casual wear line called "Edun" (which is "nude" spelled backwards and pronounced Eden). It was designed as a socially conscious company to support developing countries.
      In 2005, he was one of 166 people nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on Third World debt relief and increasing AIDS awareness.

      Two notable fellow musicians were consoled by his band's music during their final moments. Jazz legend Miles Davis developed a fascination with their 1984 album "The Unforgettable Fire" and listened to it repeatedly during the last few months of his life. U2's 2000 song "In a Little While" was the last song ever heard by punk rocker Joey Ramone, who sang along with the lyrics with his family.

      Never trust a man who tells you it's from the heart, never trust a man smoking a cigar, never trust a cowboy or a man who wears shades...
      I could go onstage, unzip my pants, and hang my dick out, and people would think it was a statement about something.
      Marriage is this grand madness, and I think if people knew that, they would perhaps take it more seriously. The reason why there's operas and novels and pop tunes written about love is because it's such an extraordinary thing, not because it's commonplace, and yet that's what you're told, you grow up with this idea that it's the norm. Hot Press, March 2000
      Overcoming my dad telling me that I could never amount to anything is what has made me the megalomaniac that you see today" - recalling his late father's influence
U2 is sort of song writing by accident really. We don't really know what we're doing and when we do, it doesn't seem to help.
      [talking about The Edge] And that's not always a given - that he would want to play guitar. He might be into keyboards this album, and you have Larry and Adam going "oh fuck, he's into the keyboards now. We'll never get a rock song out of him".
      It would be wrong for me to say, 'Yes, we can change the world with a song.' But every time I try writing, that's where I'm at. I'm not stupid. I'm aware of the futility of rock & roll music, but I'm also aware of its power.
      I represent a lot of people [in Africa] who have no voice at all... They haven't asked me to represent them. It's cheeky but I hope they're glad I do.
      The world is more malleable than you think. We can bend it into a better shape. Ask big questions, demand big answers.
      I hate the idea of being in the UK Hall of Fame to be honest with you. We don't want to be in any Hall of Fame until we're retired or dead.
      I know sometimes you shouldn't judge your audience by the fans you meet, especially if they're in a flowerbed in your garden at home but U2 fans are different, they're very humane.
Brian Wilson believes in angels. I do too and you only have to listen to the string arrangement of 'God Only Knows' for fact and proof of angels.
      What about this idea of liberty? Not liberty for its own sake, but liberty for some larger end - not just freedom from oppression, but freedom of expression and worship. Freedom from want, and freedom from fear because when you are trapped by poverty, you are not free. When trade laws prevent you from selling the food you grow, you are not free. When you are dying of a mosquito bite for lack of a bed net, you are not free. When you are hungry in a world of plenty, you are not free. And when you are a monk in Burma this very week, barred from entering a temple because of your gospel of peace, it is an affront to the thug regime, well then none of us are truly free.
      On visiting the White House: I'd like to think that I've always left the White House with more than I arrived. Not only budget commitments, cutlery, silverware, candelabras, one or two Bush family photos... OK, one Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington - it was in the bathroom, nobody could see-- I'll give it back.
      On receiving an honorary British knighthood: You have permission to call me anything you want - except sir, all right? Lord of lords, your demigodness, that'll do.
      (On Live Aid (1985)) That day changed my life and started me on this incredible adventure, that is the possibility that our generation could be remembered for something other than the Internet ... the first generation to eradicate extreme poverty ... I want to spend the rest of my life doing that, the band mouth off and complain, but they support me.
      I'm representing the poorest and the most vulnerable people. I'm throwing a punch, and the fist belongs to people who can't be in the room, whose rage, whose anger, whose hurt I represent.
      We pay millions and millions of dollars in tax. The thing that stung us was the accusation of hypocrisy for my work as an activist. I can understand how people outside the country wouldn't understand how Ireland got to its prosperity but everybody in Ireland knows that there are some very clever people in the Government and in the Revenue who created a financial architecture that prospered the entire nation. It was a way of attracting people to this country who wouldn't normally do business here and the financial services brought billions of dollars every year directly to the Exchequer. What's actually hypocritical is the idea that then you don't use a financial services center in Holland. The real question people need to ask about Ireland's tax policy is: 'Was the nation a net gain benefactor?' and of course it was - hugely so. So there was no hypocrisy for me. We're just part of a system that has benefited the nation greatly and that's a system that will be closed down in time. Ireland will have to find other ways of being competitive and attractive. (On criticisms of tax avoidance made against U2)
      [on Third World aid] The Irish people are amazing. What's so incredible about the Irish people is that if you poll them -- I think it's over 62 per cent -- even though they are hurting and there's a lot of pain in the country, they don't want to cut the aid budget. That just humbles me.
      This whole concept of celebrating the millennium, the whole concept of celebrating a particular minute in time, what is it? What's it all about? It's bollocks, isn't it? It is.
      [on Apple designer Jonathan Ive] Jony Ive is himself classic Apple. Brushed steel, polished glass hardware, complicated software honed to simplicity. His genius is not just his ability to see what others cannot, but also how he applies it. To watch him with his workmates in the holy of holies, Apple's design lab, or on a night out, is to observe a very rare esprit de corps. They love their boss and he loves them. What the competitors don't seem to understand is you cannot get people this smart to work this hard just for money. Joni is Obi-Wan.
      We were like the bastard children of The Clash who actually believed that music could change the world.
      [on meeting Freddie Mercury at Live Aid] So when Freddie Mercury comes up to me, he goes, "Hello. Mmmmm. We've all agreed that we like you." And I went, "Oh?" And he had me up against a wall and Freddie was being really playful with me. And I walked off and I went, "He's really very camp, isn't he?" Somebody said, "Queen?"
      I had one of the worst haircuts in the '80s. I know that it launched a million second-division soccer players. But the truth of it, if I'm really honest, is that I thought I looked like David Bowie.
      [on creativity] If you were of sound mind, you wouldn't need 70K people a night screaming 'I love you'.
      Nelson Mandela had humor and humility in his bearing, and he was smarter and funnier than the parade of world leaders who flocked to see him.. He could charm the birds off the trees - and the cash right out of wallets.. Mandela lived a life without sanctimony. you try it; it's not easy.. Laughter, not tears was Mandiba's preferred way. One of his cellmates told me that price Mandela paid for working in the limestone mine was not bitterness or even the blindness that can result from being around the bright white reflection day after day. Mandela could see, but the dust damage to his tear ducts had left him unable to cry. For all this man's farsightedness and vision, he could not produce tears in a moment of self-doubt or grief.
      More than anyone, it was Mandela who rebooted the idea of Africa from a continent in chaos to a much more romantic view, one in keeping with the majesty of the landscape and the nobility of even its poorest inhabitants. He was also a hardheaded realist, as his economic policy demonstrated. To him, principles and pragmatism were not foes; they went hand-in-hand. He was an idealist without naiveté, a compromiser without being compromised.
      As an activist, I have pretty much been doing what Nelson Mandela tells me since I was a teenager. He has been a forceful presence in my life, going back to 1979 when U2 made its first anti apartheid effort. And he's been a big part of the Irish consciousness even longer than that. Irish people related all too easily to the subjugation of ethnic minorities. From our point-of-view, the question as to how bloody South Africa would have to get on its long road to freedom was not abstract.
      [on Bob Geldof and "Do They Know It's Christmas?"] I thought he was ringing up to say, "I like your album", but no, he told me the album was shite but despite that fact would I like to be part of his song?
=======================================================
				Bono was born Paul David Hewson in Ballymun, Dublin on May 10th 1960, a second son to Bobby and Iris, and a younger brother to Norman.  The family lived at number 10 Cedarwood Road in Ballymun which is in North Dublin. With a Protestant mother and Catholic father, Bono grew up with a strong religious faith but avoided becoming attached to one particular denomination.  His mother died in 1974 (within days of the death of her own father) when Bono was just 14 years old, an event that was to have a strong influence on his later songwriting. Losing his mother at such a young age was something that he had in common with Larry, which led to a particularly close bond between the two, especially in the early days of the band.
				He joined a group of kids who called themselves Lypton Village, and it was there that he acquired the name Bono Vox. The members of the group would give each other names that they felt  reflected who they were better than their given names.  The origin of Bono's name has been variously attributed to a dog food, a brand of hearing aid, and the Latin phrase for 'good voice'. The hearing-aid explanation seems to be the most widely accepted.  There was a shop in the O'Connell Street area of Dublin which sold 'Bonavox' hearing aids, and this seems to have been adapted to Bono Vox.
				In the early days of the band, Bono was the dominant force, playing guitar, singing, and writing the songs. As Edge became a better guitarist however, Bono was restricted to vocals only. Even then, there was a time when the others considered removing him from the band altogether, as it was felt that his voice wasn't up to scratch. Fortunately for all concerned, he remained.
				Bono has always had a great stage presence. Even at school, where he was the first person to embrace punk, he had a flare for grabbing people's attention. From the beginning, he was a natural at working an audience and getting the best from them by interacting with them. This has been a constant feature of U2's live shows right up to the present day, perhaps most notably during the ZooTV tour, when he took on the guise of characters such as 'The Fly' and Mr. Macphisto.
				Bono was awarded the 1999 MTV Free Your Mind award for his charitable work, particularly with the Jubilee 2000  campaign. He has also been heavily involved with NetAid and Warchild, to whom the profits of the 'Miss Sarajevo' single go. These are the latest in a series of worthy causes that have been championed by Bono.  U2 have always been serious about their politics, Bono especially.  There has been disagreement at times within the band about Bono's use of the stage to preach politics to the audience at a live show.  Edge in particular is uncomfortable with the idea of lecturing fans, taking the view that there is a time and a place for political debate, but onstage during a show is not it.
				In June 2001 however, Bono literally did deliver a lecture when he gave the Class Day Address at Harvard.  Bono already had connections with the prestigious university through Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the chief economist for the Jubilee 2000 campaign.  The Elevation tour happened to be in Boston during Harvard graduation week so Sachs arranged for Bono to be invited to speak at Class Day. I was fortunate enough to attend the speech in person thanks to my good friends Perry and Win.  You can see photos of the occasion here and here.
				Since the end of the Elevation tour in December 2001, Bono has continued to be actively involved in campaigning for debt relief in Africa.  He visited Ghana, South Africa, Uganda and Ethiopia with US Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill in May 2002 and has continued to work with Debtweek (formerly DATA) with the support of several world leaders and financial backing from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  He was made a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE) in March 2007, an honour which he said would help open doors to political leaders around the world.
				Bono co-founded an investment capital business named Elevation Partners with Fred Thompson, formerly an executive with Apple.  After some initially poor investments in the likes of Palm Inc, the company reportedly made over $750 million dollars in 2011 from a highly lucrative investment in Facebook.
				In May 2010, Bono injured his back during tour rehearsals in Germany.  He underwent emergency surgery which was successful, but on medical advice the band had to pull out of 16 planned North American shows as well as their much anticipated first appearance at the Glastonbury festival at the end of June that year.  Fortunately he made a full recovery and all the cancelled shows were rescheduled for the following year.  U2's Glastonbury set made headlines for the wrong reasons when Bono was the focus of a protest by Artists Uncut, who were unhappy at U2's tax arrangements.  Security quashed the protest but some fans were left feeling that their treatment had been heavy-handed.
				Bono married childhood sweetheart, Alison Stewart, in 1982, and they have 4 children, daughters Jordan (born May 1989) and Memphis Eve (born July 1991) and son Elijah Patricius Q Guggi (born August 1999) and John Abraham (born May 2001).  The latest one was famously described by Bono as "looking like a thug" when he was born.  On 21st August 2001 Bono lost his father after a long battle against cancer.  The last few concerts on the European leg of the Elevation tour were very emotional for Bono as he paid tribute to his father at each one.
				Like the rest of the band Bono still lives in Dublin, in the exclusive suburb of Killiney anthough he also has homes in New York and Eze sur Mer in the south of France.

BonoAKA Paul David HewsonBorn: 10-May-1960Birthplace: Dublin, IrelandGender: MaleReligion: ChristianRace or Ethnicity: WhiteSexual orientation: StraightOccupation: SingerNationality: IrelandExecutive summary: Lead singer of U2The second of two boys born into a combined Catholic/Protestant Irish househould, Paul Hewson spent his childhood in North Dublin, developing his talents as a argumentative pain-in-the-ass long before music became an interest. While a member of a neighborhood gang called Lypton Village he was given the name Bono Vox -- apparently derived by one of his friends from a brand of hearing aid sold in a local shop. A generally popular individual at school, Bono suffered the first major trauma of his life at the age of 14, when his mother died suddenly of a brain aneurysm while attending her own father's funeral.  This experience later helped to create a bond between himself and future bandmate Larry Mullen, who experienced a similar loss. It was during his high school years that Bono's interest in music and performance came to the fore, and he began developing his vocal and guitar-playing skills, in addition to participating in his school's theater program.
The transition from aspiring thespian to serious performer was brought about in 1976 by an ad on the school bulletin board. Mullen had posted an open invitation to anyone interested in forming a rock group. Other respondants to the ad were brothers Dik and Dave Evans (the latter referred to as The Edge), neophyte bassist Adam Clayton and guitarist Ivan McCormick. The six initially formed a covers band named Feedback, specializing in numbers by British Invasion acts like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. This eventually evolved into a new band called The Hype (not to be confused with similarly-named the David Bowie/Tony Visconti project from the early 70s). In mid-1977 Dik Evans departed and became part of The Virgin Prunes, a heavily theatrical group that included several other former Lypton Village kids; with McCormick already jettisoned, the remaining four subsequently became U2. This new configuration finally began to attract some industry attention after winning a Guinness-organized talent contest, and by the end of 1978 (their last year of high school) manager Paul McGuinness (no relation) was directing their careers.
The early years of the band were not particularly successful, and despite Bono's enthusiastic involvement there was a point when the other members considered replacing him due to the unpolished quality of his singing and guitar-playing. His stage presence could not be overlooked, however, and as the Edge's abilities improved, the need for additional guitar was removed, while constant practice made the concerns about his voice less urgent. U2's debut release, the three track EP U2 Three, finally surfaced as an Ireland-only release towards the end of 1979, propelling them to the top of the national charts. Interest beyond their native borders continued to be elusive until the single Another Day (1980), which attracted the attention of corporate label Island Records and led to the release of their first full-length, Boy, later in the year. Critical response was largely enthusiastic, and the band supported the album with their first tour outside of the British Isles.
From the beginning, Bono and his bandmates made no secret of their Christian religious leanings, or their opinions on various social issues (although the former did not have the support of Mullen). This aspect of the band was given particular prominence on their third album War (1983) and its singles New Year's Day and Sunday Bloody Sunday. It was this album -- and New Year's Day in particular -- that broke U2 to an international audience, finally positioning them on the charts in both the UK and the US. This popularity continued to grow with each new album: first pushing them higher up the international charts with The Unforgettable Fire (1984) and then ultimately insinuating them at the top with The Joshua Tree (1987). It was during this period that Bono's status as one of the leading "social-consciousness celebrities" (alongside performers such as Bob Geldof, Phil Collins and Sting) was established, in part due to his participation in the Geldof-organized Band Aid single Do They Know It's Christmas? and the full band's involvement in the subsequent Live Aid event in 1985. A headlining role on the following year's Conspiracy of Hope tour in benefit of Amnesty International further consolidated this reputation.
In the 1990s U2 made a deliberate attempt to shed their overly-serious public image and, leaving much of their anthem-styled early output behind, began experimenting with contemporary musical styles. Live events became ridiculously elaborate traveling technology displays, with Bono providing the focus to the proceedings with extravagant theatrics and a variety of different characters. This approach was first fully indulged during the Zoo TV tour of 1992, which incorporated countless video monitors and multiple live satellite connections (one of which the singer used for repeated attempts to contact then-president George H.W. Bush at the White House). The Brian Eno-directed experiments of Achtung Baby (1991) led to the techno/electronica embellishments of Zooropa (1993), followed by the abstractions of the Passengers side project in 1995. This last project alienated some fans and critics, as did the gloomy techno/rock fusion of 1997's Pop; the band itself did not entirely disagree with this assessment, and therefore a return to their more straightforward, pre-Achtung sound was made on the next two albums, All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000) and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004).
Since U2's rise to international fame in the mid-80s, Bono has maintained a public profile above and beyond the context of the band, making use of his fame to draw attention to various political and social issues (and, it could well be argued, vice-versa). Subsequent to his involvement with Amnesty International, Greenpeace, and the various Band Aid-related projects, the primary focus of his efforts in the 00s has been to secure debt relief for Africa and other impoverished countries, and work with organizations such as NetAid and DATA -- as well as public appearances with numerous world leaders -- has been undertaken towards this end. His creative activities have also extended beyond his role in U2, with performers including Frank Sinatra, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, Keith Richards and Sinead O'Connor enlisting his skills as a songwriter. Other projects include the screenplay for the Wim Wenders-directed film The Million Dollar Hotel (2000) and the socially-conscious clothing line Edun.

The lead singer of the Irish rock band U2, Bono was born Paul David Hewson in Dublin. He met the Edge, Larry Mullen and Adam Clayton in high school and in 1978 the band was formed. U2 has sold more than 140 million albums and won 22 Grammys.		
Bono has been a leader in the fight against AIDS and poverty in Africa since 1998. He is the co-founder of ONE, a nonpartisan advocacy group backed by more than two million people that is dedicated to the fight against global poverty and disease. Through his activism, he has traveled extensively to Group of 8 and African capitals and worked directly with world leaders, as well as with influential religious and business figures involved in anti-poverty campaigning.		
Bono also co-founded (RED), with Bobby Shriver, to encourage businesses to join in the fight against AIDS in Africa. In just over two years, (RED) has generated more than $120 million from some of the biggest brands in the world for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to finance AIDS programs in Africa.		
Bono helped start EDUN, an ethically sourced clothing company run by his wife, Ali Hewson; EDUN produces clothing in developing areas of the world, particularly in Africa.		
Bono has received a number of awards for his music and activism, including the Légion d'Honneur from the French government in 2003 and Time Magazine's Person of the Year for 2005 (along with Bill and Melinda Gates). In 2007 he was awarded an honorary British knighthood and in 2008 he was given the Nobel "Man of Peace" prize at the Ninth Summit of Nobel Peace Prize Laureates.
