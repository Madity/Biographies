Tyson hosting the 40th anniversary celebration of Apollo 11 at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, July 2009
Neil deGrasse Tyson (/ˈniːəl dəˈɡræs ˈtaɪsən/; born October 5, 1958) is an American astrophysicist, author, and science communicator. He is currently the Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Rose Center for Earth and Space and a research associate in the department of astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History. From 2006 to 2011, he hosted the educational science television show NOVA ScienceNow on PBS and has been a frequent guest on The Daily Show, The Colbert Report, and Real Time with Bill Maher. Since 2009, he has hosted the weekly radio show StarTalk. In 2014, Tyson began hosting Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, an update to Carl Sagan's Cosmos: A Personal Voyage (1980) television series.[2]
Tyson was born as the second of three children in the borough of Manhattan in New York City and was raised in the Bronx.[1] His mother, Sunchita Marie (Feliciano) Tyson, was a gerontologist of Puerto Rican descent,[3] and his father, Cyril deGrasse Tyson, of African American descent, was a sociologist, human resource commissioner for New York City mayor John Lindsay, and the first Director of Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited.[4][5]
From kindergarten through high school Tyson attended public schools in New York City, all in the Bronx, which included PS 36, PS 81, Riverdale Kingsbridge Academy (MS 141), and The Bronx High School of Science (1972–76)[6] where he was captain of the wrestling team, and editor-in-chief of the school's Physical Science Journal. Tyson had an abiding interest in astronomy since he was nine years old, following his visit to Pennsylvania and seeing the stars, saying "it looks like the Hayden Planetarium".[7] He obsessively studied astronomy in his teens, and eventually even gained some fame in the astronomy community by giving lectures on the subject at the age of fifteen.[8] Tyson recalls that "so strong was that imprint [of the night sky] that I'm certain that I had no choice in the matter, that in fact, the universe called me."[7]
Astronomer Carl Sagan, who was a faculty member at Cornell University, tried to recruit Tyson to Cornell for undergraduate studies.[4] In an interview with writer Daniel Simone,[9] Tyson said:
Interestingly, when I applied to Cornell, my application dripped of my passion for the study and research of the Universe. Somehow the admissions office brought my application to the attention of the late Dr. Sagan, and he actually took the initiative and care to contact me. He was very inspirational and a most powerful influence. Dr. Sagan was as great as the universe, an effective mentor.
Tyson revisited this moment on his first episode of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey. Pulling out a 1975 calendar belonging to the famous astronomer, he finds the day Sagan invited his 17-year-old self to spend a day in Ithaca. Sagan had offered to put him up for the night if his bus back to the Bronx didn't come. Tyson said, "I already knew I wanted to become a scientist. But that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of person I wanted to become."[10][11]
Tyson chose to attend Harvard University, however, where he majored in physics and lived in Currier House. He was a member of the crew team during his freshman year, but returned to wrestling, eventually lettering in his senior year. In addition to wrestling and rowing in college, he was active in dance, in styles including jazz, ballet, Afro-Caribbean, and Latin Ballroom.[12] Tyson earned a Bachelor of Arts in physics from Harvard in 1980 and began his graduate work at the University of Texas at Austin; he was unable to complete his Ph.D. because his thesis committee voted to dissolve itself[13] and he received a Master of Arts in astronomy in 1983. In 1985, he won a gold medal with the University of Texas dance team at a national tournament in the International Latin Ballroom style. He was a lecturer at the University of Maryland from 1986-1987.[14] In 1988, Tyson was accepted into the astronomy graduate program at Columbia University, where he earned a Master of Philosophy in astrophysics in 1989, and a Doctor of Philosophy in astrophysics in 1991[15] under the supervision of Professor R. Michael Rich (now at UCLA). Rich obtained funding to support Tyson's doctoral research from NASA and the ARCS foundation[16] enabling Tyson to attend international meetings in Italy, Switzerland, Chile, and South Africa[14] and to hire students to help him with data reduction.[17] In the course of his thesis work, he observed using the 0.91 m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, where he obtained images for the Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey[18][19][20] helping to further their work in establishing Type Ia Supernovae as standard candles. These papers comprised part of the discovery papers of the use of Type Ia supernovae to measure distances, which led to the improved measurement of the Hubble constant[21] and discovery of dark energy in 1998.[22][23] He was 18th author on a paper with Brian Schmidt, a future winner of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, in the study of the measurement of distances to Type II Supernovae and the Hubble constant.[24]
During his thesis work at Columbia University, Tyson became acquainted with Professor David Spergel at Princeton University, who visited Columbia University in the course of collaborating with his thesis advisor on the Galactic bulge.[25][26][27] Tyson was a postdoctoral research fellow at Princeton University from 1991 to 1994 and it was during this period that the project to renovate the Hayden Planetarium was conceived.
Tyson's research has focused on observations in cosmology, stellar evolution, galactic astronomy, bulges, and stellar formation. He has held numerous positions at institutions including the University of Maryland, Princeton University, the American Museum of Natural History, and Hayden Planetarium.
Tyson has written a number of popular books on astronomy. In 1995, he began to write the "Universe" column for Natural History magazine. In a column he authored for the magazine in 2002, Tyson coined the term "Manhattanhenge" to describe the two days annually on which the evening sun aligns with the cross streets of the street grid in Manhattan, making the sunset visible along unobstructed side streets. Tyson's column also influenced his work as a professor with The Great Courses.[28]
In 2001, US President George W. Bush appointed Tyson to serve on the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry and in 2004 to serve on the President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy, the latter better known as the "Moon, Mars, and Beyond" commission. Soon afterward he was awarded the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal, the highest civilian honor bestowed by NASA.[29]
In 2004, he hosted the four-part Origins miniseries of PBS's Nova,[30] and, with Donald Goldsmith, co-authored the companion volume for this series, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years Of Cosmic Evolution.[31] He again collaborated with Goldsmith as the narrator on the documentary 400 Years of the Telescope, which premiered on PBS in April 2009.
As director of the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson bucked traditional thinking in order to keep Pluto from being referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center. Tyson has explained that he wanted to look at commonalities between objects, grouping the terrestrial planets together, the gas giants together, and Pluto with like objects and to get away from simply counting the planets. He has stated on The Colbert Report, The Daily Show, and BBC Horizon that this decision has resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children.[32] In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) confirmed this assessment by changing Pluto to the dwarf planet classification. Daniel Simone wrote of the interview with Tyson describing his frustration. "For a while, we were not very popular here at the Hayden Planetarium."
Tyson recounted the heated online debate on the Cambridge Conference Network (CCNet), a "widely read, UK-based Internet chat group" following Benny Peiser's renewed call for reclassification of Pluto's status.[33] Peiser's entry, in which he posted articles from the AP and The Boston Globe spawned from The New York Times's article entitled "Pluto's Not a Planet? Only in New York".[34][35]
Tyson has been vice president, president, and chairman of the board of the Planetary Society. He was also the host of the PBS program Nova ScienceNow until 2011.[36] He attended and was a speaker at the Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival symposium on November 2006. In 2007, Tyson was chosen to be a regular on The History Channel's popular series The Universe.
In May 2009, he launched a one-hour radio talk show called StarTalk, which he co-hosted with comedienne Lynne Koplitz. The show was syndicated on Sunday afternoons on KTLK AM in Los Angeles and WHFS in Washington DC. The show lasted for thirteen weeks, but was resurrected in December 2010 and then, co-hosted with comedians Chuck Nice and Leighann Lord instead of Koplitz. Guests range from colleagues in science to celebrities such as Gza, Wil Wheaton, Sarah Silverman, and Bill Maher. The show is also available via the internet through a live stream or in the form of a podcast.[37]
In April 2011, Tyson was the keynote speaker at the 93rd International Convention of the Phi Theta Kappa International Honor Society of the Two-year School. He and James Randi delivered a lecture entitled Skepticism, which related directly with the convention's theme of The Democratization of Information: Power, Peril, and Promise.[38] In 2012, Tyson announced that he would appear in a YouTube series based on his radio show StarTalk. A premiere date for the show has not been announced, but it will be distributed on the Nerdist YouTube Channel.[39] On February 28, 2014, Tyson was a celebrity guest at the White House Student Film Festival.[40]
Tyson has argued that the concept of intelligent design thwarts the advance of scientific knowledge.[43][44][45]
He has written and broadcast extensively about his views of science, spirituality, and the spirituality of science including the essays, "The Perimeter of Ignorance"[46] and "Holy Wars",[45] both appearing in Natural History magazine and the 2006 Beyond Belief workshop.[47][48] Tyson has collaborated with evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins and presented talks with him on religion and science.[49] When asked if he believed in a higher power, Tyson responded:
Every account of a higher power that I've seen described, of all religions that I've seen, include many statements with regard to the benevolence of that power. When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence.[50]
In an interview with Big Think, Tyson said, "So what people are really after is my stance on religion or spirituality or God, and I would say if I had to find a word that came closest, I would say agnostic... at the end of the day I'd rather not be any category at all."[51] During the interview "Called by the Universe: A conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson" in 2009, Tyson said: "I can't agree to the claims by atheists that I'm one of that community. I don't have the time, energy, interest of conducting myself that way... I'm not trying to convert people. I don't care."[52]
In March 2014, philosopher and secularism proponent Massimo Pigliucci asked Tyson "What is it you think about God?” Tyson replied "I remain unconvinced by any claims anyone has ever made about the existence or the power of a divine force operating in the universe." Pigliucci asked him why then did he express discomfort with the label "atheist" in his Big Think video. Tyson replied by reiterating his dislike for one-word labels, saying "That's what adjectives are for. What kind of atheist are you? Are you an ardent atheist? Are you a passive atheist? An apathetic atheist? Do you rally, or do you just not even care? So I'd be on the 'I really don't care' side of that, if you had to find adjectives to put in front of the word 'atheist.'" Pigliucci contrasted Tyson with scientist Richard Dawkins: "[Dawkins] really does consider, at this point, himself to be an atheist activist. You very clearly made the point that you are not." Tyson replied: "I completely respect that activity. He's fulfilling a really important role out there." [53]
Tyson lived near the World Trade Center and was an eyewitness to the September 11, 2001 attacks. He wrote a widely circulated letter on what he saw.[54] Footage he filmed on the day was included in the 2008 documentary film 102 Minutes That Changed America.[55]
On June 6, 2008, after the conclusion of the Democratic presidential primaries, Tyson wrote an op-ed in The New York Times in which he presented a statistical analysis of then recent polling data. From this analysis, Tyson concluded that in a hypothetical election held on the day of the publication of his article, Barack Obama would lose to John McCain, whereas Hillary Clinton would beat McCain.[56]
Tyson collaborated with the organization, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), on a public service announcement that stated, "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that kindness is a virtue."[57] He also granted PETA an interview, in which he discussed the concept of intelligence (both of human and other animals), the failure of humans to heretofore communicate meaningfully with other animals, and the need of humans to be empathetic.[58]
Tyson is an advocate for expanding the operations of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Arguing that "the most powerful agency on the dreams of a nation is currently underfunded to do what it needs to be doing".[59] Tyson has suggested that the general public has a tendency to overestimate how much revenue is allocated to the space agency. At a March 2010 address, referencing the proportion of tax revenue spent on NASA, he stated, "By the way, how much does NASA cost? It's a half a penny on the dollar. Did you know that? The people are saying, 'Why are we spending money up there...' I ask them, 'How much do you think we're spending?' They say 'five cents, ten cents on a dollar.' It's a half a penny."[59]
Right now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow.[60][61]
Inspired by Tyson's advocacy and remarks, Penny4NASA, a campaign of the Space Advocates nonprofit,[62] was founded in 2012 by John Zeller and advocates the doubling of NASA's budget to one percent of the Federal Budget, or one "penny on the dollar".[63]
As a science communicator, Tyson regularly appears on television, radio, and various other media outlets. He has been a regular guest on The Colbert Report, and host Stephen Colbert refers to him in his comedic book I Am America (And So Can You!), noting in his chapter on scientists that most scientists are "decent, well-intentioned people", but, presumably tongue-in-cheek, that "Neil DeGrasse [sic] Tyson is an absolute monster."[64] He has appeared numerous times on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. He also has made appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, and The Rachel Maddow Show.[65] He served as one of the central interviewees on the various episodes of the History Channel science program, The Universe. Tyson participated on the NPR radio quiz program Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! in 2007.[66] He has appeared several times on Real Time with Bill Maher, and he was also featured on an episode of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? as the ask-the-expert lifeline.[67] Tyson has also spoken many times on Philadelphia morning show Preston and Steve on 93.3 WMMR, as well as on SiriusXM's Ron and Fez.
Tyson has been featured as a guest interviewee on The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe, Radiolab, Skepticality, and The Joe Rogan Experience podcasts and has been in several of the Symphony of Science videos.[68][69]
In 2007, Tyson was the keynote speaker during the dedication ceremony of Deerfield Academy's new science center, the Koch Center. He emphasized the impact science will have on the twenty-first century, as well as explaining that investments into science may be costly, but their returns in the form of knowledge gained and piquing interest is invaluable. Tyson has also appeared as the keynote speaker at The Amazing Meeting, a science and skepticism conference hosted by the James Randi Educational Foundation.[70]
Tyson made a guest appearance as himself in the episode "Brain Storm" of Stargate Atlantis[71] alongside Bill Nye and in the episode "The Apology Insufficiency" of The Big Bang Theory.[72] Archive footage of him is used in the film Europa Report.

Tyson is also a frequent participant in the website Reddit's AMAs (Ask Me Anythings) where he is responsible for three of the top ten most popular AMAs of all time.[73]
In Action Comics #14 (January 2013), which was published November 7, 2012, Tyson appears in the story, in which he determines that Superman's home planet, Krypton, orbited the red dwarf LHS 2520 in the constellation Corvus 27.1 lightyears from Earth. Tyson assisted DC Comics in selecting a real-life star that would be an appropriate parent star to Krypton, and picked Corvus, which is Latin for "Crow",[75][76] and which is the mascot of Superman's high school, the Smallville Crows.[77][78]
In May 2013, the Science Laureates of the United States Act of 2013 (H.R. 1891; 113th Congress) was introduced into Congress. Neil deGrasse Tyson was listed by at least two commentators as a possible nominee for the position of Science Laureate, if the act were to pass.[79][80]
In a May 2011 StarTalk Radio show entitled The Political Science of the Daily Show, Tyson notes that he donates all income earned as a guest speaker.[81]
On March 8, 2014 Tyson made a SXSW Interactive keynote presentation at the Austin Convention Center.[82]
Tyson lives in Lower Manhattan with his wife Alice Young. They have two children: Miranda and Travis.[83][84] Tyson met his wife in a physics class at the University of Texas at Austin. They married in 1988 and named their first child Miranda after the smallest of Uranus' five major moons.[85] Tyson is a fine-wine enthusiast whose collection was featured in the May 2000 issue of the Wine Spectator and the Spring 2005 issue The World of Fine Wine.

Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson is the Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History and Visiting Research Scientist and Lecturer at Princeton University.
Born and raised in New York City, he realized he wanted to study space science when he was young, looking through a pair of binoculars at the moon. Visiting the Old Hayden Planetarium at the age of nine, he was first introduced to the stars. However, in Neil's neighborhood, "being smart is not on the list of things that gets you respect," he recalls. African-American boys were expected to be athletes, not scholars.
At thirteen, he attended summer astronomy camp in the Mohave Desert. There, he could see millions of stars in the clear desert sky. Neil deGrasse Tyson was educated in the public school system and attended the Bronx High School of Science. After graduation, he went on to earn his BA in Physics from Harvard, where he also rowed on the crew team and joined the wrestling team. After earning a Master's degree from the University of Texas at Austin, he went home to New York to do his doctoral work at Columbia and earn his PhD in Astrophysics from Columbia University.
After earning his doctorate, Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson has worked as an astrophysicist and research scientist at Princeton University, as a columnist for Stardate magazine, and, from 1996, as the first occupant of the Frederick P. Rose Directorship of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City (the youngest director in the long history of the planetarium). His association with Princeton continues, where he is a Visiting Research Scientist in astrophysics and also teaches.
Dr. Tyson published the first of six books on astronomy and astrophysics in 1988. His research interests include star formation, exploding stars, dwarf galaxies, and the structure of our Milky Way. To conduct his research, he uses telescopes all over the world as well as the Hubble Space Telescope.
He has also continued to write prolifically for the public, including a series of essays in Natural History magazine as well as the books "One Universe: At Home in the Cosmos" (coauthored with Charles Liu and Robert Irion) and a Q&A book on the universe for all ages titled "Just Visiting This Planet." "One Universe: At Home in the Cosmos" was the winner of the 2001 American Institute of Physics Science Writing Award to a Scientist. His most recent book was a memoir, "The Sky is Not the Limit: Adventures of an Urban Astrophysicist."
Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson is married with two children. The Tyson family resides in New York City. Dr. Tyson's interests include collecting fine wines, wrestling, and studying the stars.
In 2001, He was appointed by President Bush to serve on a 12-member commission that studied the Future of the US Aerospace Industry. In 2004, Dr. Tyson was once again appointed by President Bush to serve on a 9-member commission on the Implementation of the United States Space Exploration Policy, dubbed the "Moon, Mars, and Beyond" commission. Recommendations from this group formed the foundation for President Bush's new space vision.
Dr. Tysons contributions to the public appreciation of the cosmos were recently recognized by the International Astronomical Union in their official naming of asteroid "13123 Tyson." He was also voted "Sexiest Astrophysicist Alive" in the November 14, 2000 People Magazine, which is their annual "Sexiest Man Alive" issue.

Astrophysicist and Director, Hayden Planetarium,American Museum of Natural HistoryA childhood glimpse of the Moon through binoculars helped steer Neil deGrasse Tyson towards his lifelong passion for science, space exploration, and unraveling the universe's far flung mysteries. Eventually, that closer look at another world also led Tyson to his role on The Planetary Society's Board of Directors, serving first as Vice President for three years and now as Chairman of the Board.An astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History and the Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson remains close to his hometown roots in New York City where he graduated from the Bronx High School of Science. Tyson earned his BA in Physics from Harvard and his PhD in Astrophysics from Columbia.While Tyson has focused his early research primarily on stellar evolution and galactic structure, he has also devoted considerable energy to educating the public. Tyson recently hosted the four-part television series Origins on PBS and has written numerous books on the universe and humanity's place within it, including his own memoir, The Sky is Not the Limit: Adventures of an Urban Astrophysicist. Tyson is also a monthly essayist for Natural History magazine with the column, "Universe."Tyson's professional research interests include star formation, exploding stars, dwarf galaxies, and the structure of our Milky Way, working with data from the Hubble Space Telescope, as well as from telescopes in California, New Mexico, Arizona, and the Andes Mountains of Chile.In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Tyson to serve on a 12-member commission that studied the Future of the US Aerospace Industry. The final report was published in 2002 and contained recommendations (for Congress and for the major agencies of the government) that would promote a thriving future of transportation, space exploration, and national security.In 2004, Tyson was once again appointed by President Bush to serve on a commission, this time focusing on the Implementation of the United States Space Exploration Policy, dubbed the "Moon, Mars, and Beyond" commission.A man of many parts, Tyson not only has had an asteroid named after him - 13123 Tyson - but also was voted the Sexiest Astrophysicist Alive by People magazine in 2000!
The host of COSMOS: A Spacetime Odyssey, returns to our show with a behind the scenes look at the spectacular television series.
Become a member of The Planetary Society and together we will create the future of space exploration.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Neil deGrasse Tyson was born on October 5, 1958 in New York City, New York, USA as Neil de Grasse Tyson. He is known for his work on Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey (2014), Nova ScienceNow (2005) and How Life Began (2008). He has been married to Alice Young since 1988. They have two children.
      At his high school's 20-year reunion in 1996, Tyson was voted the graduate with the "coolest job."
      First African American director of the American Museum of Natural History's Hayden Planetarium, in New York City. Tyson is also a researcher, a professor of astrophysics at Princeton University, and a general-interest science columnist. Author of books for nonspecialists on space and the universe (listed under Other Works).
      The more your ideas are untestable, either in principle or in practice, the less useful they are to the advance of science.
      Recognize that the very molecules that make up your body, the atoms that construct the molecules, are traceable to the crucibles that were once the centers of high mass stars that exploded their chemically rich guts into the galaxy, enriching pristine gas clouds with the chemistry of life. So that we are all connected to each other biologically, to the earth chemically and to the rest of the universe atomically. That's kinda cool! That makes me smile and I actually feel quite large at the end of that. It's not that we are better than the universe, we are part of the universe. We are in the universe and the universe is in us.
      Science is something to be proud of, it allows us to understand the world in spite of ourselves.
      What are the lessons to be learned from this journey of the mind "through the universe"? That humans are emotionally fragile, perennially gullible, hopelessly ignorant masters of an insignificantly small speck in the cosmos. Have a nice day.
      I am proud to be part of a species where a subset of its members willingly put their lives at risk to push the boundaries of our existence.
      One thing is for certain: the more profoundly baffled you have been in your life, the more open your mind becomes to new ideas.
      When your reasons for believing something are justified ad hoc, you are left susceptible to further discoveries undermining the rationale for that belief.
      If that's how you wanna invoke your evidence for god, then god is an ever receding pocket of scientific ignorance, thats getting smaller, smaller and smaller as time goes on.
      Ever since there have been people, there have been explorers, looking in places where other hadn't been before. Not everyone does it, but we are part of a species where some members of the species do, to the benefit of us all.
      [on what his favorite sci-fi movies are] - Deep Impact (1998) and Contact (1997). They spent a lot of time getting the science right. I'm on a crusade to get movie directors to get their science right because, more often than they believe, the science is more extraordinary than anything they can invent.
      I lose sleep at night wondering whether we are intelligent enough to figure out the universe. I don't know.
      [A]s they are currently practiced, there is no common ground between science and religion. ... Although just as in hostage negotiations, it's probably best to keep both sides talking to each other.
      Whenever people have used religious documents to make accurate predictions about our base knowledge of the physical world, they have been famously wrong.
      We should not be ashamed of not having answers to all questions yet. ... I'm perfectly happy staring somebody in the face saying, 'I don't know yet, and we've got top people working on it.' The moment you feel compelled to provide an answer, then you're doing the same thing that the religious community does: providing answers to every possible question.
      I don't have an issue with what you do in the church, but I'm going to be up in your face if you're going to knock on my science classroom and tell me they've got to teach what you're teaching in your Sunday school. Because that's when we're going to fight.
      So what is true for life itself is no less true for the universe: knowing where you came from is no less important than knowing where you are going.
      [Regarding Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)] - They all knew the mother-ship was coming, they all knew it was a flying saucer, they all knew it came from another planet through the vacuum of space. And so what do they do, to the left of that monument? They set up runway lights. And I'm thinking, if you could travel through the vacuum of space, you don't need runway lights. Runway lights are if you're using air for lift. Aliens would not need air for lift.
      Emotional truths woven by lawyers in the court of law are apparently more important than the truths of actual events. I have grown to fear for those whose innocence became trapped within the legal system.
      To the scientist, the universality of physical laws makes the cosmos a marvelously simple place. By comparison, human nature-the psychologist's domain-is infinitely more daunting.
      [T]he persistent failures of controlled, double-blind experiments to support the claims of parapsychology suggest that what's going on is nonsense rather than sixth sense.
      Another practice that isn't science is embracing ignorance. Yet it's fundamental to the philosophy of intelligent design: I don't know what this is ... So it must be the product of a higher intelligence.
      This present-day version of God of the gaps goes by a fresh name: intelligent design. ... Instead, why not tally all those things whose design ... reflect[s] the absence of intelligence?
      [on if religion and science have an inherent conflict between them] - Most religious people in America, fully embrace science. So the argument that religion has some issue with science applies to a small fraction of those who declare that they are religious. They just happen to be a very vocal fraction so you got the impression that there are more of them than there actually is.It's actually the minority of religious people who rejects science or feel threatened by it or want to sort of undo or restrict where science can go. The rest, you know, are just fine with science. And has been that way ever since the beginning. And by the way, there's no tradition of scientists knocking down the door, the Sunday school door, telling the preacher what to teach. There's no tradition of scientists picketing outside of churches nor should there be some [emergent] tradition of religious fundamentalists trying to change the curriculum in the science classroom. There's been a happy coexistence for centuries.And for that to change now would be unfortunate. Because I've seen this happen in other nations and the other states where the consequences are that you just basically recede back to the cave because that's where you land when you undermine the scientific and technological innovations that come about when you're a properly trained scientist or technologist. Consider also that in America, 40% of American scientists are religious. So this notion that there's some... that if you're a scientist, you're an atheist or if you're religious, you're not a scientist, that's just empirically false. It's an empirically false statement.And what I mean by religious is that you can pose the question in a way that is unambiguous. You don't ask, well, do you go to church every Sunday 'cause plenty of people go to church, like, just for the pie, you know, or the social scene after the service. You ask people, do you pray to [a person or] God. If you say yes to that, you're religious by, presumably, anybody's standards of your conduct. And it's the yes to that question that applies to 40% of scientists. So, there're plenty of atheists who are scientists or not scientists. There maybe a conflict but many people in this country coexist in both worlds.

We Got A Badass Over Here: Doctor Neil deGrasse Tyson, Science and Social Responsibility | Geekquality.com
In the latter half of 1958, two events occurred that would have a profound effect on the science of astrophysics: one was the signing of the National Aeronautics and Space Act by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, which authorized the creation of NASA as a civilian space agency; the other, much more humble of the two, was the birth in the West Bronx of Neil deGrasse Tyson.
Born to Cyril deGrasse Tyson and Sunchita Feliciano Tyson, Neil grew up in the Skyview Apartments, a prophetically-named complex located in the relatively well-to-do neighborhood of Riverdale. His father, himself a son of immigrants from the Caribbean, was a sociologist and activist; his mother was a housewife who would later earn a Master’s degree in gerontology. That the Tyson family lived in a middle-class enclave was fairly remarkable for the late 1950′s, especially since there had been protests from residents at the time to keep Black families from moving in. Though the family was fairly off for the time, Neil was acutely aware of how fortunate he was, and how difficult things were for many other people of color in America. During Neil’s childhood, his father’s career centered on collaborating with city officials to create employment opportunities in the inner city for urban youth.
“Year after year, the forces operating against this effort were huge: poor schools, bad teachers, meager resources, abject racism, and assassinated leaders… I was watching America do all it could to marginalize who I was and what I wanted to become in life.” (1)
In a piece written for NASA’s 50th Anniversary, he describes his fascination and excitement about the space program in the 1960’s, an excitement tempered by the knowledge that he could never be an astronaut:
“[T]he vicarious thrill of the journey, so prevalent in the hearts and minds of others, was absent from my emotions. I was obviously too young to be an astronaut. But I also knew that my skin color was much too dark for you to picture me as part of this epic adventure.”
As a matter of fact, NASA was only integrated by a direct Presidential order from Lyndon Johnson to Wernher von Braun, rocketry pioneer and first director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. And, while President Johnson’s mandate instructed NASA to work with Alabama A&M and Tuskeegee University to locate qualified candidates to work with the space program, the idea of a Black astrophysicist was essentially unheard of.
It’s a good thing that no one bothered to tell young Neil, who wouldn’t be stopped from exploring the Universe even if all the astronauts were White.
As he tells in his memoir, The Sky Is Not the Limit: Adventures of an Urban Astrophysicist, it hadn’t really occurred to Neil to look to the sky until a friend encouraged him to take a pair of binoculars and look up, instead of looking down, from the rooftop of the Skyview Apartments. Until that point, he’d been voracious and intellectually curious in the unfocused way that the youngest smart kids often are. Looking up at the moon that night, and recognizing it as an entirely different world, set him on a path from which he’d never deviate. It was during a visit to the planetarium that he first saw images of stars normally obscured by the city lights and encountered the idea that one could devote a lifetime to their study. This was also his first encounter with the Hayden Planetarium, an institution that would become inextricably entwined with his career.
For a time, Neil’s remarkable interests and night-time observations went unnoticed outside his immediate family because he just didn’t have the interest in formal education. Up to the sixth grade, he was pegged as an unexceptional, if socially adept, student whose most notable feature was an outsize personality. His sixth grade teacher, on his first report card for the year, admonished, “Less social involvement and more academic diligence is in order.” This same teacher, after a series of space-centric book reports, would later direct him to a program of lectures for older junior high and high school students at the Hayden.
In junior high school, frequent nighttime trips with telescopes to the apartment rooftop often lead to uninformed neighbors calling the police to report suspicious behavior. But, each time the police came out, they would be placated by a look through the curious young man’s telescope. “For all I know, I would have been shot to death on numerous occasions were it not for the majesty of the night sky.” (2)
By age fourteen – through a small scholarship from the Explorer’s Club of New York, having met the Director of Education of the Club in an adult-level class he attended at the Hayden  - Neil had traveled to South Africa to observe a total solar eclipse off the coast. On the same trip he met Isaac Asimov, who would remember him well enough to write a blurb for his first book many years later.
He gave his first lecture the following year, an hour-long talk based on his photos from an astronomy camp in the Southern California desert the summer before. The lecture had been organized by a relative and was delivered as part of a continuing education program for New York City College students. Neil’s enthusiasm carried him through, without giving much thought to the fact that he was addressing a roomful of adults twice his age, or older.
The most remarkable thing about young Neil’s trajectory until that point was how far his fascination with the universe had taken him. He’d been so spectacularly charming and obvious about his love that people around him couldn’t help but present him with opportunities to express it. Neil’s childhood offers a valuable insight into what can happen when passion and potential are paired with opportunity, insofar as educational opportunities for people of color. He was gifted (though he prefers to note that he just worked extremely hard), but it was incumbent on the people around him to look past the color of his skin and encourage him to be in the right places at the right times.
Of course, Neil was too busy studying the skies in western Scotland, or visiting with Carl Sagan, who tried to entice Neil to enroll at Cornell, to notice the implications of what he was accomplishing. It was early in his studies at Harvard – which he chose over Cornell, having scrupulously studied the statistics and compared the universities – that the old doubts resurfaced, once expressed in the knowledge that he could never be an astronaut.
In a conversation with a fellow member of his wrestling team, during his freshman year at Harvard, Neil was flatly told that “Blacks in America do not have the luxury of your intellectual talents being spent on astrophysics.”
“Those words sat heavily with me”, he recalled, “because here I was just following my love of the universe, without any particular reference to the plight of society.”
“Astrophysics,” he said in a later interview, “is not the first subject you think of to put food on somebody’s plate, or to somehow improve the situation of the underprivileged in the world.” And while he had known that he was doing the right thing for himself, he did wonder if he was “doing the right thing, culturally.”
“And I knew my interest in the Universe was real, because I felt it in my heart, coursing through my veins. But my responsibility as an educated member of society was eating away at that ambition. In the absence of another way to think about the problem, I just kept at it with this albatross around my neck, this guilt that maybe I wasn’t doing all I could to help others.”
For the first time in his life, he was lead to truly question his choice of career based on his race. This became increasingly problematic when he looked around at what his fellow Black students at Harvard were doing with their gifts. The teammate who’d questioned the value of what Neil was doing was an economics major and a Rhodes scholar, studying economic solutions for impoverished urban centers. Of his graduating class of 1,600 only 131 were Black. Of these, two went into academics – the rest went into law, medicine, business, further deepening Neil’s questions about his obligations to his race.
Neil had been an excellent athlete, and found that he was not only lauded, but his qualifications and abilities were never questioned. Besides his accomplishments on the Harvard wrestling team, he was part of the rowing team and a gold medal-winning ballroom dancer. These activities didn’t conflict with society’s perceptions of where his talents should lie. However, in his academic pursuits, he often found himself faced with questions and disbelief; he had transgressed against the recognized order of things, and his path became a difficult one:
“At no time was I perceived as a future colleague, although this privilege was enjoyed by others in graduate school. When combined with the dozens of times I have been stopped and questioned by the police for going to and from my office after hours, and the hundreds of times I am followed by security guards in department stores, and the countless times people cross the street upon seeing me approach them on the sidewalk, I can summarize my life’s path by noting the following: in the perception of society, my athletic talents are genetic; I am a likely mugger-rapist; my academic failures are expected; and my academic successes are attributed to others.” (2)
In spite of this, in spite of his doubts, and frequent instances of being pulled over by incredulous police for driving while Black, occasionally with a carfull of textbooks, he would not be derailed from his trajectory: “After some fits and starts through my years in school, when becoming an astrophysicist seemed at times to be the path of most resistance through an unwelcoming society, I became a professional scientist. I became an astrophysicist.” (1) But, while his passions had carried him a long way, he still couldn’t quite shake the effect of the accusation from his former teammate.
The turning point came almost a decade later, when as a graduate student he was invited to speak at a local FOX affiliate regarding recent solar explosions. Donning his only tie, he taped his first television appearance, reassuring viewers that an explosion of plasma from the Sun, many times the size of Earth, would have no greater effect than a spectacular display of Aurora Borealis. He describes his reaction that night, as he watched the segment on the evening news:
“So, there it is. And, at the end, I had an epiphany. A revelation. It was 1989. I had never before in my life – and I believe, to this day, that it was the first such occasion – but I had never before in my life seen an interview with a Black person, on television, for expertise, that had nothing to do with being black.
“The guy didn’t ask me, ‘How do Black people feel about this plasma coming from the sun?’ He didn’t say ‘What does your community feel about this?’ ‘Will it harm your skin the way it will harm ours?’ That’s not the conversation that unfolded.”
He realized that he had proven something by having nothing to prove. In a world where the intelligence of people of color, and Blacks specifically, is dismissed out of hand, he realized that the pursuit of his passion for astrophysics was a service to the Black community, doing his part to silence the claims of intellectual inferiority. Here he was, a scientific authority, speaking directly to viewers in their homes, and subtly, but indelibly, undermining long-standing stereotypes:
“So if you had visible examples of this, then whatever is your next encounter with the Black person trying to squeegee your windshield at the red light, and, if you’re prone to saying ‘Oh, these Black people, they don’t work, and they’re too dumb, you’re going to have to remember that I just told you that Earth is safe from the plasma that came from the Sun. So, you’re going to have to reconcile this. You’re going to have to be wondering, ‘Well, maybe this guy could have been one of those, but for lack of opportunity, but for lack of institutions with foresight.”
“I said to myself, I just have to be visible. I, or others like me, in that situation. That would have a greater force on society than anything else I could imagine.” As a matter of fact, he would note in his memoir, that he has “refused all invitations to speak for black history month on the premise that [his] expertise is neither seasonal nor occasional.”
“It’s not that the Black community cannot afford to have me do astrophysics. It’s that the Black community cannot afford to have me not do astrophysics.”
At the time of his graduation from Columbia, he became only the seventh Black astrophysicist in America.
After completing his doctorate at Columbia in 1991, Neil went on to a research position at Princeton, and shortly thereafter, in 1994, returned to the Hayden Planetarium as a research assistant, his life once again intersecting with that of the institution that started him on his road as an astrophysicist. In 1996, when he was just 38, he’d become the youngest-ever director at the Hayden.
His career as a pop culture icon began long before then, starting with a column for Star Date magazine in the early 80’s. His book Universe Down To Earth (1994) marked the true beginning of his path as a popular author; in 2000 he was voted “Sexiest Astrophysicist” by People Magazine. By 2004 he was hosting a Nova miniseries on PBS, and, in October of 2005, he made his first appearance on The Colbert Report, beginning a very long relationship with late night comedy talk shows, including The Daily Show, Late Night with Conan O’Brien, The Tonight Show and Real Time with Bill Maher.
Between these appearances and the exploding popularity of YouTube clips of his various speaking appearances, with clips regularly garnering hundreds of thousands of views, he became possibly the most visible astrophysicist in pop culture since Carl Sagan.
His most popular solo youtube clip, with 1.3 million views, spawned a baffling phenomenon that has made him an even larger celebrity, in a video praising the achievements of Sir Isaac Newton – discovering the laws of optics, motion and the universal law of gravitation, and, in order to properly explain why planets orbit in ellipses, invents calculus before the age of twenty six.
At 1:32 in the clip, Tyson throws up his hands in sheer wonderment at what Newton had accomplished. This brief, emotive series of gestures was made into an animated GIF, which made its way onto reddit, to be used as a reaction to a question the poster found so obvious it defied answering. Shortly thereafter, an iconic image emerged, paired with the now almost ubiquitous phrase, “Watch out guys, we’re dealing with a badass over here”.
“Initially it was really weird and creepy”, Neil said in an interview segment discussing his odd, new fame as an Internet meme.  “And then I said, this, in total, is a celebration. I should not object. It’s a little weird and creepy, but, I’m okay with it.”
And so, we celebrate the career of Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson. Between his Internet popularity, hosting duties, record-breaking number of talk show appearances, best-selling books, podcasts, lectures, interviews, and blogs, he’s almost unavoidable. Relentlessly evangelizing for science, reason, research and education, on TV screens in our living rooms, he takes on stereotypes while never once addressing them directly. He’s passionate, erudite, funny and genuine. His only agenda is helping others to discover the wonder of the universe.

Great read! I appreciate the in depth article, which highlighted his upbringing and his journey of growing up middle-class and black in America. I’m an avid supporter/fan of Dr. Tyson. Currently trying to find a poster of him having trouble finding/buying one… :/.
My 8 years old boy is doing his school project for Black History Month in Neil deGrasse Tyson. This article is by far the best one for him to read.
Oh, man, that’s fantastic! Glad to hear that Dr. Neil is gaining fans with the little ones and not just us weird Internet people.
If you’re looking for a good source for the project, though, I really, really recommend The Sky Is Not the Limit: Adventures of an Urban Astrophysicist. It’s about how Dr. Neil became Dr. Neil, in his own words.
I recall the first time I saw Dr. Tyson on television. In addition to being educated and entertained, I was so pleased that FINALLY the expert was a person of color. It made me tear up. At the time, television just wasn’t  holding up people of color as “the expert.” By just being his amazing self, he has changed what children of color might aspire to. We love and admire you so much at our house, Dr. Tyson.
Crazy. I just read an article which displays a letter that Carl Sagan wrote him with Neils address. . My family  lived in 5700 Arlington Avenue 1B. Neil and his family lived above us in 8b. Exactly 7 stories up directly above us.

Thank you so much for telling it like it is out there. I’ve been watching everything I can that you’ve done on tv. You’re a terrific educator and writer. Who but from you can someone pick up a book on astrophysics and come away amused and enlightened. Thank you for giving so much of yourself to the rest of us. I’m almost eighty years old and when I listen to you finally it all makes sence.  
I come from a time when the moon was made of cream cheese. And how delightful it is knowing I can take everything you say to the bank. Thank you.
If  enough people – of any background –  could just do the same for themselves (in spite of social or peer pressures), stereotypes would be not be an issue.

With the dead end at the Yucca Mountain Repository for Radioactive Waste and $9.5 billion spent and no solution. Has anyone asked NASA, about Shipping Nuclear Waste to be incinerated in the sun? Which in its self; is one huge nuclear reactor, right? I realize that solar winds would push a vehicle away from the sun. But wouldn’t the gravitational pull of the sun minimize the fuel needed to ship the waste there.
Rockets cost a lot of money. Nuclear waste is heavy, so it would take a lot of rockets. The only solution for nuclear waste is to not make it in the first place.

Ph.D., Columbia University, 1991 "A Study of the Abundance Distributions Along the Minor Axis of the Galactic Bulge"
Neil deGrasse Tyson's professional research interests are broad, but include star formation, exploding stars, dwarf galaxies, and the structure of our Milky Way. Tyson obtains his data from the Hubble Space Telescope, as well as from telescopes in California, New Mexico, Arizona, and in the Andes Mountains of Chile.
In 2001, Tyson was appointed by President Bush to serve on a 12-member commission that studied the Future of the US Aerospace Industry. The final report was published in 2002 and contained recommendations (for Congress and for the major agencies of the government) that would promote a thriving future of transportation, space exploration, and national security.
In 2004, Tyson was once again appointed by President Bush to serve on a 9-member commission on the Implementation of the United States Space Exploration Policy, dubbed the "Moon, Mars, and Beyond" commission. This group navigated a path by which the new space vision can become a successful part of the American agenda. And in 2006, the head of NASA appointed Tyson to serve on its prestigious Advisory Council, which will help guide NASA through its perennial need to fit its ambitious vision into its restricted budget.
In addition to dozens of professional publications, Dr. Tyson has written, and continues to write for the public. He is a monthly essayist for Natural History magazine under the title "Universe." And among Tyson's eight books is his memoir The Sky is Not the Limit: Adventures of an Urban Astrophysicist; and Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution, co-written with Donald Goldsmith. Origins is the companion book to the PBS-NOVA 4-part mini-series Origins, in which Tyson serves as on-camera host. Beginning in the fall of 2006, Tyson hosts the PBS-NOVA's spinoff program NOVA ScienceNow, which is an acessible look at the frontier of all the science that shapes the understanding of our place in the universe.
