 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Academy Award Winning Actress Jennifer Lawrence, best-known for playing Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games (2012), was born in Louisville, Kentucky on August 15, 1990. Her career began when she spent a Summer in Manhattan at the age of 14. During that time, she scored some small commercial and film roles, and shortly thereafter her family moved to Los Angeles so she could further pursue her dream. She was cast in the TBS sitcom The Bill Engvall Show (2007), and in smaller movies like The Poker House (2008) and The Burning Plain (2008).Her big break came when she played Ree in Winter's Bone (2010), which landed her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations. Shortly thereafter, she secured the role of Mystique in franchise reboot X-Men: First Class (2011), which went on to be a hit in Summer 2011. Around this time, Lawrence scored the role of a lifetime when she was cast as Katniss Everdeen in the big-screen adaptation of literary sensation The Hunger Games (2012). That went on to become one of the highest-grossing movies ever with over $407 million at the domestic box office, and instantly propelled Lawrence to the A-list among young actors/actresses. Three Hunger Games sequels are scheduled for release in November 2013, 2014, and 2015, with Lawrence reprising her role at least for the first one (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013)). In 2012 the romantic comedy Silver Linings Playbook earned her the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Satellite Award and the Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress, amongst other accolades, making her the youngest person ever to be nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Actress and the second-youngest Best Actress winnerLawrence can also be seen in The Beaver (2011), Like Crazy (2011), House at the End of the Street (2012), and American Hustle (2013).
          Jennifer Lawrence was born in Louisville, Kentucky. She has 2 older brothers, Ben and Blaine, sister-in-law Meredith, and her parents are Gary and Karen Lawrence.Jennifer, known to her friends and family as "Jen", was discovered in New York City at the age of 14. Before Jennifer became an actor, she was involved in cheer-leading, field hockey, softball, and modeling, none of which she held a passion for.In the spring of 2004, she traveled to New York City and set up a few auditions with talent and modeling agencies. After conducting her first cold read, the agents told her mother that "it was the best cold read by a 14- year-old they had ever heard", and tried to convince her mother that she needed to spend the summer in Manhattan. After leaving the agency, Jen was spotted by an agent in the midst of shooting an H&M ad and asked to take her picture. The next day, that agent followed up with her and invited her to the studio for a cold read audition. Again, the agents were highly impressed and strongly urged her mother to allow her to spend the summer in New York City.As fate would have it, she did spend that summer in New York City and appeared in commercials such as MTV's "My Super Sweet 16" and played a role in the movie, The Devil You Know (2013). Shortly thereafter, her career forced her and her family to move to Los Angeles where she was cast in the TBS sitcom The Bill Engvall Show (2007) and movies such as The Poker House (2008) and The Burning Plain (2008).Perhaps her most well-known work to date is her role as "Katniss Everdeen" in The Hunger Games (2012).
      For her role in Winter's Bone (2010), Lawrence learned to skin squirrels, chop wood, and fight.
      Lawrence was discovered by a photographer while visiting New York with her mom in 2005, which led to her landing an agent.
      Is the 3rd youngest Oscar nominee for best actress in a leading role, at the age of 20 years 163 days. Only Quvenzhané Wallis in Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012), at the age of 9 years 135 days, and Keisha Castle-Hughes for Whale Rider (2002), at the age of 13 years 309 days, were younger, at the date of nominations announcement.
      She is fan of Jeff Bridges, and got the chance to meet him at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con. Lawrence approached him, not realizing he was in the middle of an interview with Entertainment Tonight, and hurried away. Bridges noticed and immediately called her back. The reporter then handed a star-struck Lawrence the microphone and invited her to take over the interview.
      Appeared in two Sundance Grand Jury Prize winners in a row: Winter's Bone (2010) and Like Crazy (2011).
      Some of her favorite actresses/acting inspirations are Meryl Streep, Marion Cotillard, Cate Blanchett and Laura Linney.
      Her father had a concrete construction firm, Lawrence & Associates, and her mother runs a children's camp.
      For her role as Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games (2012), Lawrence worked out twice a day and practiced archery.
      She has portrayed the daughter of Paula Malcomson twice - in a 2007 episode of the television series Cold Case: A Dollar, a Dream (2007) and in The Hunger Games (2012).
      (November 30, 2012) Named "Entertainer of the Year", along with Ben Affleck, by Entertainment Weekly.
      Brought her parents as her date to the 70th Golden Globe Awards after breaking up with her boyfriend Nicholas Hoult.
      Became the second youngest recipient of the Best Actress Oscar upon winning the award for Silver Linings Playbook (2012) on February 24, 2013 (age 22); the youngest recipient is Marlee Matlin, who won for Children of a Lesser God (1986) on March 30, 1987 (age 21).
      By age 23, she became the youngest actress to be nominated for three Oscars, including two of them for leading role, one of which she won.
      Is the third Oscar-winning Actress to appear in the X-Men films, the others being Anna Paquin and Halle Berry. All three of them will appear together in X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014).

      Universal and Imagine announced in Fall 2013 that Lawrence will be cast to play the role of Cathy Ames in an eventual remake of the 1955 movie East of Eden (1955), itself based on the classic 1952 novel by John Steinbeck. The remake will be directed by The Hunger Games (2012)'s Gary Ross, and will consist of two parts and two movies. Lawrence's role will be featured in the first film.
      Her love of Doritos chips caused her to stain several dresses while on the set of American Hustle, nearly ruining them in the process. The wardrobe department solved this problem by creating a number of identical dresses for her to use throughout the production so she would always have a clean one to wear.
      The longest she has gone without an Oscar nomination is the 2 years between Winter's Bone (2010) and Silver Linings Playbook (2012).
      Was the 141st actress to receive an Academy Award; she won the Best Actress Oscar for Silver Linings Playbook (2012) at The Oscars (2013) on February 24, 2013.
      [on auditions and meetings] - The miserable ones are the ones where all the girls auditioning are in the same room. There's no talking in those rooms. I've tried.Yesterday I had to do an interview. I was in a horrible mood. I couldn't think of basic words. I could see my publicist in the background, mouthing things to say. They want you to be likable all the time, and I'm just not.
      Where are the Robert Redfords and Paul Newmans of my age group? I love James Franco, but where's the next James Franco? Where are the hunks who can act?
      There are actresses who build themselves, and then there are actresses who are built by others. I want to build myself.
      ... I have this feeling of protectiveness over characters I want to play. I worry about them-if someone else gets the part, I'm afraid they won't do it right; they'll make the character a victim or they'll make her a villain or they'll just get it wrong somehow.... When I get like that, anything's possible.
      [on her role in Winter's Bone (2010)] - I'd have walked on hot coals to get the part. I thought it was the best female role I'd read - ever. I was so impressed by Ree's tenacity and that she didn't take no for an answer. For the audition, I had to fly on the redeye to New York and be as ugly as possible. I didn't wash my hair for a week, I had no makeup on. I looked beat up in there. I think I had icicles hanging from my eyebrows.
      When I first got to New York, my feet hit the sidewalk and you'd have thought I was born and raised there. I took over that town. None of my friends took me seriously. I came home and announced, 'I'm going to move to New York,' and they were like 'OK.' Then when I did, they kept waiting for me to fail and come back. But I knew I wouldn't. I was like, 'I'll show you.'
      I'd like to direct at some point. But I don't know because 10 years ago I would have never imagined that I'd be here. So in 10 years from now, I might be running a rodeo.
      I don't really diet or anything. I'm miserable when I'm dieting and I like the way I look. I'm really sick of all these actresses looking like birds... I'd rather look a little chubby on camera and look like a person in real life, than look great on screen and look like a scarecrow in real life.
      I like when things are hard; I'm very competitive. If something seems difficult or impossible, it interests me.
      [on not wanting to be famous] I look at Kristen Stewart now and I think, "I'd never want to be that famous". I can't imagine how I'd feel if all of a sudden my life was pandemonium.
      I'm doing what I love, and then I get months and months of rest. I have a lot of money for a 21-year-old. I can't stand it when actors complain.
      I hate saying, 'I like exercising.' I want to punch people who say that in the face. But it's nice being in shape for a movie, because they basically do it all for you. It's like, 'Here's your trainer. This is what you can eat.... I don't diet. I do exercise! But I don't diet. You can't work when you're hungry, you know?
      [on being asked if The Hunger Games (2012) transitioned her too quickly into stardom] - I think about this all the time. But when you get a promotion at your job, you don't go "That was too fast. Can I stay in the mailroom a while longer?" You take it.
      [on posing in an Esquire magazine photo shoot to try and help shake up her public image] A lot of people said, "Oh, now we have a great actress come along and she's showing her boobs". But that's exactly what I had to do so I could keep working. Honestly, that photo shoot is what helped me get "X-Men" [X-Men: First Class (2011)].
      There's just no imagination in Hollywood. I wanted to show people Winter's Bone (2010) for the performance, but it ended up having the opposite effect. People were like, no, she's not feminine, she's not sexual.
      [on referring to the characters she's played in Winter's Bone (2010) and The Hunger Games (2012)] I don't know what it is with me and maternal wilderness girls, I just love 'em. Even before "Winter's Bone", the first movie I ever did, The Poker House (2008), I was caring for my younger siblings in a tough, dark situation.
      [on suffering through school] I always felt dumber than everybody else. I hated it. I hated being inside. I hated being behind a desk. School just kind of killed me.
      I think it gets so much easier to let things roll off your back. It's such a business of hurry up and wait, and if you let it get to you it will drive you absolutely insane. Like, 'Why was I called in at four in the morning and I haven't been used until one in the afternoon?' And 'Why are we shooting this a million times when we have five other scenes to shoot?' But you get to the point where you just say 'This is filmmaking. This is what you get paid for. Everybody is doing the best they can. It's what you have to live with.'
      It's always been about the script and the director, for me. There are directors that I want to work with and that I admire. You can love a script, but if it doesn't have a good director, it won't be that. I like to adapt to a director's way of working. I love doing that. Each director is so different, and you have to adapt to this new way of doing something. That's what's amazing to me. That's why I love directors. I don't want the director to have to work around me. I think it's more fun for me to come in on their thing.
      [on her acting method] To you it looks emotionally straining, but I don't get emotionally drained, because I don't invest any of my real emotions. I don't take any of my characters' pain home with me, I don't even take it to craft services. I've never been through anything that my characters have been through. And I can't go around looking for roles that are exactly like my life. So I just use my imagination. If it ever came down to the point where, to make a part better, I had to lose a little bit of my sanity, I wouldn't do it. I would just do comedies.
      [on owning her own bow and arrows] One time I actually used it for defense. I pulled into my garage and I heard men in my house. And I was like, 'I'm not letting them take my stuff. I had just gotten back from training, so I had the bow and arrows in the back of my car. I went to my car and I put this quiver on me and I had my bow and I loaded it and I'm walking up the stairs. And I look, and my patio doors were open, and there were guys working right there, and I was like, 'Heyyy, how you doin'?' They [her friends] were like, 'We've got to stage someone to break into your house and you can kill them!' That would be the funniest news ever. Katniss Everdeen actually kills someone with a bow and arrow!'
      Not to sound rude, but [acting] is stupid. Everybody's like, 'How can you remain with a level head?' And I'm like, 'Why would I ever get cocky? I'm not saving anybody's life. There are doctors who save lives and firemen who run into burning buildings. I'm making movies. It's stupid.'
      [on meeting/being wowed by acting idols] Once I'm obsessed with somebody, I'm terrified of them instantly. I'm not scared of them-I'm scared of me and how I will react. Like, for instance, one time someone was introducing me to Bill Maher, and I saw Meryl Streep walk into the room, and I literally put my hand right in Bill Maher's face and said, 'Not now, Bill!,' and I just stared at Meryl Streep. [when asked if she met Meryl Streep] Of course not. I just creepily stared at her.
      [on the moral of The Poker House] Things can happen to you, but they don't have to happen to your soul.
      [on forgetting to thank Harvey Weinstein in her Best Actress acceptance speech at the 85th Oscars (2013)] It's been fun. I guess I'll never work again.
      [when asked in the Oscar Press Room, about what happened when she tripped on the stairs while accepting the award for Best Actress] Was that on purpose? Absolutely!...What do you mean what happened? Look at my dress! I tried to walk up stairs in this dress, that's what happened. Yeah, I think I just stepped on the fabric and...they waxed the stairs.
      Don't worry about the bitches - that could be a good motto, because you come across people like that throughout your life.
      I never play characters that are like me because I'm a boring person. I wouldn't want to see me in a movie.
      In Hollywood, I'm obese. I'm considered a fat actress. I eat like a caveman. I'll be the only actress that doesn't have anorexia rumors! I'm never going to starve myself for a part. I'm invincible. I don't want little girls to be like, "Oh, I want to look like Katniss, so I'm going to skip dinner!"
      [on skinning squirrels in Winter's Bone (2010)] I should say it wasn't real, for PETA - but screw PETA.
      [on her dancing ability] I'm a horrible dancer!... I'm like a dad at prom... I look like Gumby getting electrocuted.
      As soon as somebody farts around me, I think it's hilarious. This is something my brothers did that now the boys at work are obsessed with. You cup it, and then you throw it in someone's face and say, "Take a bite out of that cheeseburger!"
      The best birthday present I ever received was a T-shirt my friend had made that said "I passed out in Disneyland 07" (I had heat stroke in Disneyland).
      I am just a normal girl and a human being, and I haven't been in this long enough to feel like this is my new normal.
      I'm still getting used to everything. It still makes me a little emotional, just to see how quickly everything kind of changes -- that it changes so fast.
      [on mental illness] It's just so bizarre in this world; if you have asthma, you take asthma medicine. If you have diabetes, you take diabetes medicine, but as soon as you have to take medication for your mind it's...there's such a stigma behind it.
      Mt parents saw me so truly happy that they sacrificed everything for my happiness. Without my family, I would be nothing.
      [on fame] I'm from Kentucky. I used to be very personable and make eye contact and smile at people, and now all I do is look down. When I'm at dinner and one person after another keeps interrupting to take pictures, it's like, 'I can't live like this.'
      [on being dubbed the 'Sexiest Woman In The World' by FHM magazine] It's the lie heard around the world. I know the truth. I know Beyoncé is the queen of the world.
=======================================================
Jennifer Shrader Lawrence (born August 15, 1990) is an American actress. Her first major role was as a lead cast member on the TBS sitcom The Bill Engvall Show (2007–09). She subsequently appeared in the independent films The Burning Plain (2008) and Winter's Bone (2010), for which she received her first Academy Award for Best Actress nomination; at the time, she was the second youngest person to receive a nomination in the category.
At age 22, Lawrence's performance in the David O. Russell-directed romantic comedy Silver Linings Playbook (2012) earned her several awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress (Musical or Comedy) and the Academy Award for Best Actress, making her the second-youngest Best Actress winner at the Oscars.[1] For her supporting role in Russell's comedy-drama American Hustle (2013), she was awarded the Golden Globe Award, the BAFTA Award and received a third Academy Award nomination, all for Best Supporting Actress.[2][3][4][5]
Lawrence is also known for playing Raven Darkhölme / Mystique in the superhero film X-Men: First Class (2011) and its sequel X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014). Beginning in 2012, she gained international fame for playing the leading heroine, Katniss Everdeen, in the popular The Hunger Games film series, which established her as the highest-grossing action heroine of all time.[6][7]
Lawrence was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky. She is the daughter of Karen (Koch) Lawrence, a children's camp manager, and Gary Lawrence, a construction worker. She has two older brothers, Ben and Blaine.[8] By the age of 14, she had decided to pursue an acting career, persuading her parents to take her to New York City to find a talent agent. Prior to finding success in Hollywood, Lawrence attended Kammerer Middle School in Louisville. She graduated from high school two years early with a 3.9 average, aiming at a career in acting.[9][10] While growing up and in between acting, Lawrence served as an assistant nurse at the children's summer day camp that her mother ran.[11]
In July 2007, Lawrence started her acting career as a teenager in the TBS comedy series The Bill Engvall Show, playing Lauren Pearson, the oldest daughter.[12] The series went on the air in September 2007 and was canceled in 2009 after three seasons.[13] Lawrence was nominated for and won a Young Artist Award for Outstanding Young Performer in a TV Series in their 2009 award show for her role, and was nominated for Best Performance in a TV Series (Comedy or Drama).[14][15]
In 2007, Lawrence auditioned for the role of Bella Swan in Twilight, but the role went to Kristen Stewart. Later, Lawrence stated that she was "glad" that she had not received the role because of the massive media attention that Stewart received.[16][17] The following year, she appeared in a small role in the film Garden Party as Tiff.[18] Lawrence had the lead role in another film director's debut, Lori Petty's family drama The Poker House, opposite Selma Blair and Chloë Grace Moretz, where she starred as Agnes, a young girl who is a victim of abuse.[19] She was awarded the Los Angeles Film Festival Award for Best Performance in the Narrative Competition in 2008 for her role in the film.[20] It was followed by an appearance on the big screen in Guillermo Arriaga's film directorial debut The Burning Plain, opposite Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger. Her performance in the film earned her the Marcello Mastroianni Award for best emerging actor/actress at the Venice Film Festival in 2008.[21] She appeared in the music video for the song "The Mess I Made", from Parachute's 2009 album Losing Sleep.[12]
Lawrence's lead role in Debra Granik's Winter's Bone, which won best picture at the Sundance Film Festival in 2010, is often cited as a breakout performance for her.[22] She portrayed Ree Dolly, a 17-year-old in the Ozark Mountains who cares for her mentally ill mother and her younger brother and sister.[23] The performance was highly acclaimed by film critics. David Denby from The New Yorker said "the movie would be unimaginable with anyone less charismatic playing Ree."[24] Peter Travers from the Rolling Stone also spoke highly of her and noted that "her performance is more than acting, it's a gathering storm. Lawrence's eyes are a roadmap to what's tearing Ree apart."[25] Receiving accolades for her performance, Lawrence was awarded the National Board of Review Award for Best Breakthrough Performance.[26] She received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress on January 25, 2011, at the time becoming the second-youngest actress to be nominated for the category (though she is currently the third-youngest).[27] Also in 2011, Lawrence co-starred in the independent film Like Crazy, which premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival.[28]
She starred as shape-shifting villain, Mystique, alongside James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender in X-Men: First Class, a prequel to the rest of the X-Men film series.[29] Lawrence's Mystique is a younger version of the character played by Rebecca Romijn in earlier X-Men films.[30] In 2011, Lawrence appeared in The Beaver, a dark comedy starring Jodie Foster and Mel Gibson; it was completed in 2009 but the film spent an extended period of time stalled due to controversy and was released on May 6, 2011.[31] In June 2011, it was announced that Lawrence was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[32]
In 2012, Lawrence starred as Katniss Everdeen in the film The Hunger Games, based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Suzanne Collins. Despite being a fan of the books, Lawrence took three days to accept the role because she was initially intimidated by the size of the movie and how it might affect her career.[33][34] She underwent extensive training to get in shape for the role, including stunt training, archery, rock and tree climbing, combat, running, parkour, pilates, and yoga.[35][36] The film was released on March 23, 2012, and set a record for the third-largest opening weekend, making a record-breaking $152.5 million in three days for a non-sequel film.[37] The success of The Hunger Games, and Lawrence as Katniss, broke the male-centric nature of action films — prior to The Hunger Games, among the "top 200 worldwide box-office hits ever ($350 million and up), not one had been built around a female action star."[38] Forbes stated "No one who has seen The Hunger Games would question star Jennifer Lawrence's ability to play an action star."[39] Though the film generally received positive reviews, Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss Everdeen was the most highly praised, with Todd McCarthy from The Hollywood Reporter saying Lawrence embodies Katniss, "just as one might imagine her from the novel" and "anchors" the whole film "with impressive gravity and presence", ultimately calling her "the ideal screen actress."[40] Kenneth Turan from the Los Angeles Times stated that Lawrence is the "best possible performer as Katniss and is the key factor in making 'Hunger Games' an involving popular entertainment with strong narrative drive that holds our attention."[41] Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert also agreed that "Lawrence is strong and convincing in the central role."[42]
In October 2012, Lawrence was announced as the new face of Dior.[43] The following month, she played the recently widowed Tiffany Maxwell in David O. Russell's Silver Linings Playbook, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Matthew Quick, opposite Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro.[44] She received widespread critical praise for her performance in the film, with Richard Corliss of Time writing, "The reason to stay is Lawrence. Just 21 when the movie was shot, Lawrence is that rare young actress who plays, who is, grown-up. Sullen and sultry, she lends a mature intelligence to any role... Jennifer Lawrence is the silver lining in this mostly ordinary playbook."[45] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also wrote that Lawrence "is some kind of miracle. She's rude, dirty, funny, foulmouthed, sloppy, sexy, vibrant, and vulnerable, sometimes all in the same scene, even in the same breath. No list of Best Actress Oscar contenders would be complete without the electrifying Lawrence in the lead. She lights up the screen."[46] She won the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film.[47][48] She also starred alongside Max Thieriot and Elisabeth Shue in Mark Tonderai's thriller House at the End of the Street.[49] She was originally cast to play Ophelia "O" Sage in the film Savages directed by Oliver Stone, but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts.[50]
Filming for The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, the next installment in the Hunger Games series, began in September 2012, and the film was released on November 22, 2013.[51] It became a major commercial and critical success. Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss Everdeen won her praise from fans and critics alike. Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice wrote that Lawrence is "both on fire and in the process of becoming, and it's magnificent to watch."[52] Catching Fire surpassed Iron Man 3 on January 9, 2014, for highest box office earnings of 2013 in North America with $409.4 million.[53] Lawrence also played Rosalyn Rosenfeld, a supporting role in David O. Russell's crime drama American Hustle. The film, based on the FBI ABSCAM operation, is set against the backdrop of political corruption in New Jersey in the late 1970s. Lawrence played the wife of a con artist portrayed by Christian Bale. The film also features Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, and Jeremy Renner in principal roles, and was released on December 20, 2013.[54] Lawrence received critical acclaim for her performance[55] and was nominated for Best Supporting Actress by the Screen Actors Guild and the Critics' Choice Awards.[4][5] She won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress on January 12, 2014.[56] She also received the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and a third Academy Award nomination, her first for a supporting role,[3][57] becoming the youngest actress to have three nominations.[58]
Lawrence replaced Angelina Jolie in Susanne Bier's depression-era drama, Serena, based on the novel of the same name by Ron Rash.[59][60] She plays the role of an unstable woman named Serena who learns that she can never bear her husband's children and sets out to murder the woman who bore her husband an illegitimate son before their marriage. Filming was completed in 2012, and the film was scheduled to be released in April 2014.[61] In 2014, Lawrence again played Mystique, in the film X-Men: Days of Future Past, with James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. She will reprise her role as Katniss Everdeen in the film adaptations of the final Hunger Games book, Mockingjay. The first part of the film is set to be released on November 21, 2014, and Part 2 on November 20, 2015.[62]
Lawrence will star in and produce the film adaptation of Claire Bidwell Smith's memoir The Rules of Inheritance, directed by Susanne Bier.[63] In September 2013, it was announced that Lawrence was to star in the adaptation of the novel East of Eden with director Gary Ross.[64] The film is based on the John Steinbeck novel and was already adapted to film in 1955, starring James Dean (although the film only adapted the latter half of the novel).[65] Additionally, she was chosen to star in Burial Rites, a film adaptation of Hannah Kent's debut novel, where she would be joined again by Gary Ross.[66] She will also be starring in her third collaboration film directed by David O. Russell, titled The Ends of the Earth,[67] which is described as "a fact-based love story about a powerful oil tycoon who has everything stripped from him after he is caught in an affair."[68] In addition, Lawrence will play Jeannette Walls in the film adaptation of Walls' best-selling memoir The Glass Castle.[69] Lawrence will also reprise her role Mystique in the upcoming X-Men: Apocalypse.[70]
Lawrence's performances thus far have prompted Rolling Stone to call her "the most talented young actress in America."[71] In 2013, Time named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world,[72] ELLE Magazine named her the most powerful woman in the entertainment business in 2013,[73] and in 2013 she ranked No. 1 on AskMen's list of Top 99 Most Desirable Women of the year.[74] In June 2013, Lawrence was ranked #49 on Forbes' list of the world's most powerful celebrities.

1990Southern ComfortJennifer Lawrence is born in Louisville, Ky., to Karen (who runs a children's camp) and Gary (who owns a concrete-contracting business). As a child, she shines in a bit role as a prostitute from Nineveh in a church play about the Book of Jonah. "This little extra just took over," her mother later tells Louisville Magazine of her youngest child. "She played the best prostitute." 2004New York MinuteA high school cheerleader and local theater regular, Lawrence visits New York with her mom to interview at talent agencies. While strolling around Manhattan, "a guy asked to take my picture," Lawrence recounts in an Esquire interview. "We probably should have realized how creepy that was." Fortunately, he turns out to be a legitimate scout, and agents soon come calling. 2007Steady GigsHaving finished high school early, Lawrence returns to New York and lands a smattering of gigs, including an Abercrombie & Fitch ad, a Burger King commercial, and appearances on TV's Monk and Medium. She soon relocates to L.A. for the TBS sitcom The Bill Engvall Show. "From 15 to 16 I sucked, because I had no idea what I was doing. Then I slowly stopped sucking," she says of her early acting experience.2009Bad to the 'Bone'After starring in two hard-hitting indie dramas, (The Burning Plain and The Poker House), Lawrence auditions for the lead in Winter's Bone. Wary of her good looks, producers initially reject her for the gritty role of Ree Dolly, a poor-as-dirt teen who hunts down her meth-dealing dad. "Then, like a psychopath, I followed them to New York on the red-eye and showed up the next day at the casting there," she recalls to PEOPLE. "Not brushing my hair or washing my face did the trick." 2010FebruaryGold StandardWith the release of Winter's Bone, the virtual unknown receives rapturous reviews. "Winter's Bone may be a small film, but Lawrence's performance is world class," writes PEOPLE. The accolades culminate in a Best Actress Oscar nomination. "I'm going to the Oscars," she raves to EW, before making a dazzling turn at the ceremony in her figure-skimming Calvin Klein dress. 2011June'X'-posureLawrence ups her box-office appeal by appearing as scantily clad, shape-shifting mutant Mystique in the blockbuster comic-book franchise X-Men: First Class. "Nothing's sacred anymore," she jokes of her body-paint costume for the film, which debuts at No. 1 and brings in $120 million worldwide. Let the 'Games' Begin!Lawrence's first major studio lead role arrives when she's cast as heroine Katniss Everdeen in the film adaptation of author Suzanne Collins's wildly popular trilogy The Hunger Games. Heralded as the new Harry Potter-meets-Twilight, the project raises Lawrence to leading lady status. "I knew that as soon as I said yes, my life would change," the actress tells EW of the movie, for which she dyes her blonde hair brown.2012March 23'Game' On!The Hunger Games rakes in more than $251 million during its first 10 days at the box office, besting the competition two weeks in a row. Of Lawrence's blockbuster performance, PEOPLE's movie critic Alynda Wheat raves that the actress "is a fan's dream. With her soulful eyes and innate grit, she gives skilled hunter Katniss equal doses of complexity and appeal. Forget Twilight's insipid Bella Swan. This is a literary heroine girls can cherish."2013January 10By the PlaybookLawrence returns to her indie roots with Silver Linings Playbook, starring as a young widow who helps Bradley Cooper's character get his life back on track. "I was confused by her," she tells The Hollywood Reporter of the role of Tiffany. "Somebody who is very forceful and bullheaded is normally very insecure, but she isn't. I was driven to her to kind of discover that personality a little bit more." The part lands Lawrence a best actress Golden Globe and SAG Award, as well as an Oscar nomination. February 24Besting the RestCapping off a near-perfect awards season run, Lawrence is named Best Actress at the 2013 Academy Awards for her role in Silver Linings Playbook. On her way to the podium, the actress briefly stumbles and trips over her Dior Haute Couture gown, but plays off the slipup with her trademark sense of humor. "Thank you!" she says. "You guys are just standing up 'cause you feel bad that I fell and that's really embarrassing, but thank you."

A fictional film set in the alluring world of one of the most stunning scandals to rock America, American Hustle tells the story of brilliant con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale), who along with his equally cunning and seductive British partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) is forced to work for a wild FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper).

Jennifer Shrader Lawrence (born August 15, 1990) is an American film and television actress. She has had lead roles in TBS’s The Bill Engvall Show and in the independent films The Burning Plain and Winter’s Bone, for which she received critical acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.
Lawrence was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, the daughter of Karen, who runs a children’s camp, and Gary Lawrence, who once owned a construction firm. She acted in church plays and, by the age of 14, had decided to pursue an acting career, persuading her parents to take her to New York City to find a talent agent. Although she had no training or experience, she received high praise from the agency for which she auditioned. She graduated from high school two years early in order to begin acting.
Lawrence starred in Guillermo Arriaga’s directorial debut The Burning Plain, opposite Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger. Her performance in the film earned her the Marcello Mastroianni Award for best young emerging actor/actress during the Venice Film Festival in 2008.
 She was part of the main cast of the TBS comedy The Bill Engvall Show as Lauren Pearson. Written and created by Bill Engvall and Michael Leeson, the show is set in a Denver suburb and follows the life of ‘Bill Pearson’ (played by Engvall), a family counselor whose own family could use a little dose of counseling. The series was canceled in 2009 after having aired three seasons. Lawrence’s other film credits include a lead role in Lori Petty’s The Poker House opposite Selma Blair and Bokeem Woodbine as well as roles in Devil You Know and Garden Party. Her television credits include roles on Cold Case, Medium, and Monk. She is also featured in the music video for the song “The Mess I Made”, from the album Losing Sleep by Parachute.
 Lawrence had the lead role, frequently cited as a “breakout performance” for her, in Debra Granik’s Winter’s Bone (which won best picture at the Sundance Film Festival in 2010). She portrays a seventeen-year-old girl in the rural Ozarks, caring for her mentally-ill mother and her younger brother and sister, when she discovers that her father has put their house and land up as a bond for a court appearance. Lawrence received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, for the role, on January 25, 2011.
 Lawrence’s upcoming work includes a role in The Beaver, a dark comedy starring Jodie Foster and Mel Gibson. The Beaver was filmed in 2009, but after spending an extended period of time stalled due to controversy surrounding Gibson, it received a release date of March 23, 2011. Lawrence also has a starring role in the independent film Like Crazy, which premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival and has reportedly been picked up by Paramount Pictures for a wider release. In the summer of 2011, Lawrence will appear as shape-shifting villain Mystique in X-Men: First Class, a prequel to the rest of the X-Men film series. Lawrence’s Mystique is a younger version of the character played by Rebecca Romijn in earlier X-Men films. Lawrence is also set to star alongside Elisabeth Shue in Mark Tonderai’s thriller House at the End of the Street, which completed filming in 2010 and is in post-production.
 Lawrence has stated that she has never taken drama classes or acting lessons, simply relying on her instincts when playing a role. She lived in New York City for the first few years of her career, but resides in Santa Monica, California.
 Lawrence has been cast as Katniss Everdeen in the movie Hunger Games, set to be released in March 2012.

Height: 5'9" Hometown: Louisville, Kentucky, United States In a Relationship With:Nicholas Hoult Best Quotes:“You don't want your relationship to be in the press, but at the same time, and this is only a theory, the more you try and keep it secret, the more the media tries to crack it open.”“I couldn't be happier about being a part of 'Hunger Games' and to play Katniss. I have a huge responsibility to the fans of this incredible book and I don't take it lightly. I will give everything I have to these movies and to this role to make it worthy of Suzanne Collins' masterpiece.”“My cousin cleaned out a shotgun for me and let me carry it around the house, because he said, 'Anybody who knows anything about guns is going to know in a second if someone has held a gun before.' I didn't want to be that person. I wanted to be practiced.” 
Jennifer Lawrence (born Jennifer Shrader Lawrence in Louisville, Kentucky on August 15 1990) is an American actress. She started out her career by playing leading roles in TBS’s The Bill Engvall Show and in the independent films, The Burning Plain and Winter’s Bone, for which she received nominations for the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, Satellite Award, and the Screen Actors Guild Award. At age 20, she became the second youngest actress ever to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress.
Lawrence is also known for playing the villian Raven Darkhölme / Mystique in the 2011 film X-Men: First Class. In 2012, she achieved wider recognition, starring as the heroine, Katniss Everdeen, in The Hunger Games, an adaptation of Suzanne Collins’ best-selling novel of the same name. Her performance in the film garnered her notable critical praise and marked her as the highest-grossing action heroine of all time.

She is currently dating her X Men: First Class co-star, Nicholas Hoult. She believes that she is “fat” by Hollywood standards. She lives in Santa Monica, California. She took lessons in hunting before she starred in Winter’s Bone, as she wanted to be “believable”.

Jennifer Lawrence sat down with Vogue to discuss paparazzi and the super "weird" past that made her the lovable star she is today. It turns out America's dream best friend had a pretty "unhappy" childhood. 
"I was a weirdo," she said, candidly. “I’ve always just had this weird anxiety. I hated recess. I didn’t like field trips. Parties really stressed me out. And I had a very different sense of humor." 
The "Hunger Games" star shares a few quirky stories -- for example, one about the time she thought it would be really funny to jump out the emergency exit of a moving bus. Yet, her experiences are less light-hearted than the movie star we've come to love. Lawrence was placed into therapy and heavily medicated for quite some time. In fact, her issues didn't really clear up until she left high school and properly pursued acting at the age of 15. 
Once she found something she was "good at," her parents saw a major change. ‘We’re paying for therapy and all this medication, and we don’t need it when she’s here," Lawrence heard her mother say to her father on the phone. "She’s happy."
Now that Lawrence is super famous, she's once again struggling to adjust. She complains about being unable to maintain her privacy, strange men sleeping on her lawn, and feeling "like a monkey in a zoo." "I'm kind of going through a meltdown about it lately," she admits. 
Perhaps it's time for a break. "Catching Fire" director Francis Lawrence ("no relation") discussed his concern over Lawrence's hectic lifestyle. In truth, she has basically lived on movie sets since shortly after she set off to begin acting in 2006. Though she was supposed to pause for a breath between "Catching Fire" and "X-Men," Lawrence was asked to join the cast of "American Hustle," while being praised for her "Silver Linings" victory. 
“I think that going from one set to the next to the next will eventually take a toll," Mr. Lawrence adds. "I hope at some point she gets some time off.”
