AnnaSophia Robb (born December 8, 1993) is an American actress. She gained prominence in 2005 with starring roles in Because of Winn-Dixie and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. She is also known for her roles in Bridge to Terabithia (2007), Race to Witch Mountain (2009), Soul Surfer (2011), and The Way Way Back (2013). She starred as Carrie Bradshaw on The CW series The Carrie Diaries from 2013 to 2014.
Robb was born in Denver, Colorado, the only child of Janet, an interior designer, and David Robb, an architect.[1][2] She was named after her maternal great-grandmother, Anna Sophie, and her paternal grandmother, Anna Marie.[3][4] She is of Danish, English, Irish, Scottish, and Swedish descent.[5] She grew up in a Christian home and was home-schooled.[6][7] She competed in dance and gymnastics for four and a half years, but quit in order to focus on acting.[3] In 2009, the Arapahoe Herald reported that she was attending Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colorado.[8]
After appearing in a commercial for McDonald's, Robb had a small role in the episode "Number One Fan" of the television series Drake & Josh. Her first major role was as the title character in the television special Samantha: An American Girl Holiday. She wore a long brown wig for the part.
Robb's two big-screen appearances in 2005 were both adaptations of popular children's books. She starred as Opal in Because of Winn-Dixie and as the competitive and rude Violet Beauregarde in Tim Burton's remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The latter was a major box office success worldwide, and helped escalate Robb's popularity among pre-teen audiences.
In 2005, Robb was the face of Trad Clothing, helping to design and model a fashion line for girls. In 2006, she had a guest role on the cartoon show Danny Phantom as the voice of Danielle "Dani" Fenton. Robb played Leslie Burke in Bridge to Terabithia, which opened in U.S. theaters on February 16, 2007. She recorded a song for the soundtrack titled "Keep Your Mind Wide Open", and the accompanying video received rotation on the Disney Channel.[3][9] The song peaked at number ninety on the Billboard Hot 100 during the week of March 1, giving Robb her first charting single.[10] Robb was a fan of the book before being cast in the role, saying that it "touched me in a way I hadn't been touched by a book before".[4]
Robb went on to appear in The Reaping, Have Dreams, Will Travel, Jumper, and Spy School. Despite negative reviews of the film overall, Robb's performance in Sleepwalking garnered praise. Time film critic Richard Schickel said: "There is a wonderful range to Robb's work...this is extraordinarily mature acting from someone this young and she wins our sympathy without once begging for it."[11] In 2008, she recorded the voice of Mary Magdalene in The Word of Promise: Next Generation – New Testament: Dramatized Audio Bible.[12] She also starred in Race to Witch Mountain (2009).[13] In 2010, she appeared in The Space Between. She then starred in Soul Surfer, playing Bethany Hamilton, who continued to surf after losing her arm in a shark attack.[14]
In May 2011, Robb was announced to star as Wendy in a new and dark take on the classic story about Peter Pan, tentatively titled Pan.[15] As of 2014, the film has yet to go into production. It was reported on February 3, 2012, that Robb had landed a role in Life at These Speeds.[16] Later that month, Robb was cast as Carrie Bradshaw in The CW's Sex and the City prequel, The Carrie Diaries,[17] and appeared in the summer comedy The Way Way Back.
In May 2012, Robb announced that she was admitted to Stanford University, though she was deferring acceptance due to filming commitments.[18] She will begin attending Stanford in the fall of 2014.
When Robb lives in New York, she attends Hillsong Church NYC. In December 2013, she appeared on Katie in support of the church and its pastor.[19]
On March 30, 2008, Robb won her first career award when she was named Leading Young Actress at the Young Artist Awards for her role in Bridge To Terabithia. The film itself won a Young Cast award.[20] On April 24, 2009, she received the Horizon Award at the 14th Annual Palm Beach International Film Festival. She was awarded the Rising Star Award at the Denver Film Festival on November 12, 2009.[14]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          AnnaSophia began her career on a church stage, in front of 500 people in Colorado, USA.She made her movie debut, playing "Anna", in the Christie Eckert movie, "Daddy's Day". Then, there's the just-completed television guest-starring role for Nickelodeon, where she plays "Liza" in Drake & Josh (2004). AnnaSophia was on location in Toronto, playing the lead in Samantha: An American Girl Holiday (2004), a TV movie for Warner Bros. In the summer of 2005, she began filming Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), portraying the role of the gum-chewing "Violet Beauregarde", starring opposite Johnny Depp.Of course, AnnaSophia was ready for her busy life before the camera. She has competed in gymnastics since she was five, has won awards in Irish dance as early as seven, landed a national recurring radio voice-over at eight, and got her first TV and print commercial in Denver six months later (the ad is still in use).You might say that AnnaSophia has danced her way to the movies, since she started by excelling equally well in jazz, hip-hop, break-dancing, and the Irish jig. But, she's also pretty terrific at swimming, skiing, running, and modeling. And when she's not working with animals, she's telling jokes and doing a bit of singing. AnnaSophia is managed by Gem Entertainment Group Inc. and represented by Cunningham, Escott, Dipene, & Associates talent agency.

      [on what she learned from filming her first movie] Well, Wayne Wang, the director, really helped me become a more mature actress. When I first started filming, I was really over the top. He just helped bring me down and make me real. That was really wonderful, a really wonderful experience. Also, what I learned about filming is it takes forever. I mean, there are so many different angles and shots. I mean, it just takes forever.
      [on filming in a small town] Well, I'm kind of an urban girl. I like big cities. I like New York. I like London. I like L.A. I like people. I get lonely, really, really easily. But I think it was good. It was very different and I think that's good.
      If you act weird, people are going to treat you weird, but if you're just yourself, people respond to that.
      Everyone always says that guys are intimidated by me, but I seriously doubt it. I mean, I'm five-foot-nothing!
      When you're a kid, you have these big ideas and these big dreams to make a change, or maybe you feel like you can't make a difference.
      When I'm at home or at school, I'm casual and comfortable. I tend to wear work out clothes and lots of sweaters.

=======================================================
AnnaSophia Robb began performing at the age of five on a church stage in her hometown of Denver, Colorado. By the time she was seven, she was winning awards in Irish dance competitions. In 2002, at the age of eight, she landed a national radio voiceover and did her first print and TV commercial. Shortly after, she played a role in the still-unreleased independent film, Daddy's Day. /p>
Since then, AnnaSophia hasn't stopped working. At the age of nine, she won a lead role in the 20th Century Fox feature film Because of Winn-Dixie (2005), directed by Wayne Wang and co-starring Jeff Daniels. Next, she was off to Toronto to film the title role in the WB's TV movie based on the very popular American Girl dolls/books: Samantha, An American Girl Holiday (2004). For the role, she covered her short blonde hair with a long brown wig, so she would more closely resemble the character. 
Just a week after filming wrapped, she flew to London, England to play Violet Beauregarde in the highly anticipated Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), opposite Johnny Depp. AnnaSophia also found time to guest star on an episode of the TV series Drake & Josh in 2004, playing the role of Liza. More recently she played Bethany Hamilton in the true life story, Soul Surfer. 
In her spare time, AnnaSophia enjoys swimming, gymnastics, skiing, running, singing and spending time with her animals. She lives with her family in Colorado.

For some actors a career in film seems to be in the cards from the very beginning; such was the case with early bloomer AnnaSophia Robb. The only child of an architect and an interior designer, Robb knew from the age of five that she was destined for a career as an entertainer. A Denver, CO native who never wavered in her determination to succeed, Robb convinced her parents to let her take an acting class before setting out on her first round of L.A. auditions in 2003. It was during this time that her new manager and agent team would help young Robb successfully navigate the Hollywood audition scene, her family living in a modest guest house as her father worked and her mother took Robb to auditions during the daytime hours. By the end of the summer, Robb had attended no less than 42 auditions and had landed her first role as a Bratz-loving Happy Meal fan in a McDonald's commercial.  Due to the success of her first voyage west, it didn't take much to encourage Robb to come back to Hollywood in the spring, and after receiving notice that auditions were being held for Wayne Wang's Because of Winn-Dixie, it was time to gas up the car for the long haul once again. Fate seemed to play a curious role during the trip when her father pulled out a stack of librarian-recommended books on tape that he had rented only to find the recorded version of the best-selling Kate DiCamillo novel sitting right on top, and before long Robb was preparing to help bring Dixie to the big screen. Having previously played the lead in the made-for-television movie Samantha: An American Girl Holiday, it didn't take Robb long to find her place in front the camera, and she frequently credits Dixie director Wang with providing the advice she needed to advance as an actress. A subsequent role as bubblegum-chomping brat Violet Beauregarde in the Tim Burton film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory allowed the young actress to cut loose and have a bit of fun on film, and in 2006 Robb could be seen fending off the forces of evil in the apocalyptic horror thriller The Reaping. She had a major part opposite Josh Hutcherson in the 2007 adaptation of Bridge to Terabithia. The next year she had a small part in Jumper, and the year after that she would star opposite The Rock in the remake of Race to Witch Mountain. In 2011 she had the lead in the inspirational surfing film Soul Surfer, playing a girl whose arm was bitten off by a shark. In 2013, she won the starring role in the CW's The Carrie Diaries, playing a young version of Carrie Bradshaw (a role first embodied by Sarah Jessica Parker on the HBO series Sex and the City). ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi

AnnaSophia's family loves to travel. By the age of 14, AnnaSophia had already been to Mexico, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Japan, India, and all across the United States. One of her most memorable journeys involved flying across the world with her family to bring supplies and offer assistance in newly implemented schools for the Dalits, the Untouchable of India. 
AnnaSophia and her classmates once raised $1500 to build a drinking well for the refugees in Darfur. They decided that they could raise enough to build it if each of the 40 students got $10 from four different people, and it worked.
In previous interviews, AnnaSophia has said that although she never ate Twinkies before filming Bridge to Terabithia, she had one practically every day on set, and sometimes two. "I was so Twinkie deprived, and now I just can't look at another Twinkie," she has joked.
AnnaSophia says that she and the extras in Bridge to Terabithia (who were kids) got along really well, and they often played Twenty Questions while waiting around for the school bus scenes.
AnnaSophia enjoys gymnastics and participated on a team for a while, but she quit once she began acting. AnnaSophia has acknowledged that the sport is very intense and eventually takes up most of the athlete's time, so that's why she did not continue. She does, however, have a close friend from her former team, who is a serious gymnast. 
AnnaSophia has indicated that she is disappointed that her parents chose to spell her name with two N's instead of one. She does not like it when people call her "Ann-uh" Sophia; she prefers "Ah-nuh" Sophia.
AnnaSophia has said that although she hates structured exercising--such as using a treadmill--she loves dancing, swimming, and being outside. When the weather is nice, she enjoys running or taking a walk.
AnnaSophia kept all the gum that she chewed on the set of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and the wad of gum was about equal to the of a softball.
AnnaSophia has joked about how swimming--which she loves doing--is the one thing she can beat Josh Hutcherson (her Bridge to Terabithia co-star) at.
AnnaSophia is good friends with actor Josh Hutcherson, who co-starred with her in 2007's Bridge to Terabithia and is one year older than her. "We still talk on the phone twice a week," Hutcherson said in a 2007 interview, 2 years after filming ended.
By the age of 13, AnnaSophia has already worked with an impressive number of big-name stars, including Mia Farrow, Jeff Daniels, Dave Matthews, Johnny Depp, and Hilary Swank.
AnnaSophia has said that her favorite part of her 2007 film Bridge to Terabithia is the final scene, where the main character Jess walks across the bridge with his younger sister May Belle. "I think it really shows what Leslie was trying to get Jess to do," AnnaSophia says of the scene.
AnnaSophia has raved about her funky wardrobe for Bridge to Terabithia. "I want to take all the clothes home. They're so cool!" she has said. Unfortunately, she was only able to keep two outfits from the film.
Gabor Csupo, director of the 2007 film Bridge to Terabithia, has said that during the casting period, AnnaSophia Robb wrote a beautiful letter that detailed her passion for the book and her interest in playing the role of Leslie Burke. Csupo says that this letter was very heartwarming, but ultimately, he says he wouldn't have cast her unless she was totally appropriate for the part (which he feels she was).
When AnnaSophia was about eight years old, a friend from her gymnastics class died from a rare disease that closed up her throat. 
AnnaSophia, who sang her very first song for the Bridge to Terabithia theme song "Keep Your Mind Wide Open," has acknowledged that the accompanying music video was very awkward to do at times. "My hair was sticking to my lip gloss, and I was so nervous!" she recalls. AnnaSophia enjoyed doing the song, but she has also indicated that she is not planning a singing career--at least for the time being.
In an early scene during the film Bridge to Terabithia, there is a shot where 6-year-old actress Bailee Madison (May Belle) gives AnnaSophia's character Leslie a very dirty look as she is walking away. It was necessary for the scene, but AnnaSophia has recalled how horrible she felt when Bailee did this, because her acting was so authentic, and AnnaSophia was scared that this sweet little girl really did despise her. Fortunately, all was well when Bailee gave AnnaSophia a hug immediately afterward.
When the casting director of Bridge to Terabithia first came across AnnaSophia, his initial thought was that she was too cute to play rough-and-tumble tomboy Leslie Burke. During auditions, however, AnnaSophia nailed the character and demonstrated a true understanding of who Leslie was, so she landed the role.
AnnaSophia has said that the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings movies are among her favorites, because she loves the whimsical quality of fantasy films. She has also read all the books that these movies are based on.
Interestingly, AnnaSophia's first major film roles have all been based upon popular children's books: Samantha: An American Girl Holiday, Because of Winn-Dixie, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Bridge to Terabithia. AnnaSophia's role in the 2007 Hilary Swank film The Reaping officially broke the pattern she was on.
She was named after her paternal grandmother, Anna Marie, as well as her maternal great-grandmother, Anna Sophie.
Her first recorded song is called "Keep Your Mind Wide Open" for her 2007 movie, Bridge to Terabithia.
In January 2007, she was named one of the top 16 young stars in Hollywood by Disney Adventure magazine.
After starring in a commercial for McDonald's, she made her acting debut in 2004, appearing in a television special titled Samantha: An American Girl Holiday.
Her favorite clothing stores are Jigsaw London, TRAD (for which she has modelled) and Abercrombie & Fitch.
Her hair is actually blonde, but dyed it brown for the part of Samantha in Samantha:An American Girl Holiday.
She is an only child and truly enjoys the companionship of several close friends and her ten cousins, eight girls and two boys.
AnnaSophia is managed by Gem Entertainment Group Inc. and represented by Cunningham, Escott, Dipene, & Associates talent agency.
In late January 2007, a music video for her song "Keep Your Mind Wide Open" was shown on Disney Channel.
AnnaSophia enjoys dancing. Her favorite types of dance are jazz, hip-hop, break-dancing, and the Irish jig.
Because of her gymnastic skills, she got the part as Violet Beauregarde from the movie, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
She beat out her friend Taylor Dooley to two parts; her guest appearance on Drake and Josh, and her role in as Samantha from An American Girl Holiday.
AnnaSophia: (on taking up the role of a young Carrie Bradshaw that Sarah Jessica Parker originated) I definitely didn't want to mimic Sarah Jessica Parker because I have a very different energy but I obviously watched the show and I want to capture the flavor of the original.
AnnaSophia: (on which she prefers doing; movies or tv) Movies. I just feel like I have more versatility that way. I can move from one film to the next and do all different genres and stuff like that. But I think TV shows are great.
AnnaSophia Robb: I love to read, and I am kind of different from most of the kids at my school. I hate gossip and being catty and playing games with guys' minds. I'm not into it. I'd rather be reading a book. I have to laugh at it sometimes. You hear all these stories, and then you get to L.A, and there are bigger problems - like world poverty. The kids at my school just aren't talking about that.
AnnaSophia Robb: I want to go to college. I want to have other options. But, as I get more and more involved with filmmaking, I just grow to love it more and more. There are just so many different avenues, and I hope I can keep on acting. I have been very blessed, and I have been very fortunate, and my family has been so supportive, but I think, in the end, I'll end up producing and acting. That's what I think I am going to do.
AnnaSophia Robb: (about co-star Johnny Depp) He's a really amazing guy. There was such a big mob around him all the time, so when I was filming with him, I got nervous because everyone was making such a big deal about him. But when I just got to talking with him, he's just a really sweet man - really normal and loves his kids and is always talking about them.
AnnaSophia Robb: Yeah, they asked me to sing a song for Bridge to Terabithia, which was a little intimidating. I actually tried to quit a couple times, but they just really wanted me to do it. And I'm glad I did, because it was an experience I've never done before, and stretched me, and I had a good time, and it was a fun thing.
AnnaSophia Robb: (about going to college) Yes! Oh my gosh. 100% yes, definitely. I've always wanted to go to college--I don't know what college--just to explore the world. I want to learn languages--many, multiple languages. And I love to help people, so I think it would be fun to do some nonprofit work. I already am doing nonprofit work, but just to try to help people.
AnnaSophia Robb: I only want to do good projects. I want to make good decisions. If it's just a dumb movie, then no, I'd rather stay in school. But if it's a movie worth telling and that I think I would really benefit from, then I would like to do it. And that's one of the reasons I still live in Colorado. I love being with my family and going to school, and then when I come out to L.A., that is the time to be in the movies. People ask me the questions, I do the promotion work, then I get to go back home and live my life.
AnnaSophia Robb: (about celebrities she admires) I really like Natalie Portman. She went to college, and she's still in the film industry, making good choices in her career. And I think Hilary Swank and Charlize Theron — they're both two actresses that I've worked with and that I admire for how good they are, what they do, how grounded they are, how kind they are to everyone, and they treat everybody the same.
AnnaSophia Robb: (about being noticed by fans) It's just what comes along with the job. It's increasing more and more; there's more recognition, but sometimes I feel a little bad for my friends when we go to the mall. I feel bad for them rather than for myself, because they might feel a little bit uncomfortable or they're just tired of it. But you know, I'm just AnnaSophia, and I'm just going to the mall and I'm as goofy as ever, and they'll get stopped, and it makes them feel kind of uncomfortable, so I feel bad for my family. But I knew this was coming, and I just have to deal with it with grace.
AnnaSophia Robb: (about playing a child who never showered in "The Reaping") It was pretty nasty. Every day I'd get in and it was just dirt, all dirt. They would cover me, but it was fake dirt, which was kind of weird. So it was actually a bit of a relief, because I could spill stuff on my wardrobe by accident, and it wouldn't really matter, and I could get all dirty and no one would really care. I just had to be careful about touching other people.
AnnaSophia Robb: (about the book "Bridge to Terabithia", and her character in the movie) I love Leslie. She's always lit. She always has this happiness and glow about her, that I think people just get attracted to. And no one can bring her down.
AnnaSophia Robb: (about what attracted her to the character of Opal in "Because of Winn Dixie")There are not many characters for kids that have much depth, and she really has a quality to her. She has an understanding of human beings. She can kind of sense their sadness, sense that they need somebody.
AnnaSophia Robb: (about actress Dakota Fanning) She's actually younger than me, which is kind of weird. She's a wonderful actress. I really admire her. I'm thankful that I got to work with her little sister [Elle]. But I'd like to meet her one day. I saw I am Sam, and she was wonderful in that. She was six or seven when she did that, and it was quite interesting. But I really look up to Nicole Kidman and Meryl Streep, because the younger actors have had good careers, but I don't think our generation has had enough experience to really be looked up to. 
AnnaSophia Robb: (about the director of "Bridge to Terabithia") I love his accent! He's Hungarian, so he's fun to listen to.
AnnaSophia Robb: I love gum, I kept gum and blueberries. They are very good together actually. I kept all the gum that I chewed on set.
AnnaSophia Robb: (on filming a movie in a small town) Well, I'm kind of an urban girl, I like big cities. I like New York, I like London, I like L.A. I like people, I get lonely, really, really easily. But I think it was good, It was very different and I think that's good.
AnnaSophia Robb: (about co-star Bailee Madison in "Bridge to Terabithia") And that's how Bailee Madison is, who plays little May Belle. She reminds me a lot of Leslie, because she was dancing around one day, and she just fell over--you know, she tripped. She wasn't embarrassed at all. She just got right back up and started dancing again. And I really admire that. And I think everyone should try to have that, because we're all just people.
AnnaSophia Robb: (about co-star Josh Hutcherson's competitiveness while filming the race scenes for "Bridge to Terabithia") He's a boy, so he's extremely competitive. What can you say? All the boys there. We, at the beginning, were trying to work out the timing. And Josh says he was just trying to work out the timing, but really, he wanted to show everyone that he was faster than the car that was driving alongside us, trying to film. That's really what he was trying to prove. But we finally got it worked out. And I was tired by the end of it. I mean, just running back and forth, back and forth, doing all these different things. And at lunch, he goes, "Let's race!" I was like, "Okay. Fine, Josh, we'll race. Fine. Whatever you want." So we say go, and I take off, but then I stopped and just [turned around and walked] back, because I'm all tired. And he gets to the end, and he's all excited, and he's like, "Yes! I won! I won! I won!" He turns around, and he's like looking for me, and then he realized it was a hoax. And his face was so disappointed I actually felt kind of guilty. I was like, "Jeez. Wow, he takes it really serious." But he's definitely a fast runner.
AnnaSophia Robb: (about filming scenes in "Bridge to Terabithia," where the special effects were not added until after filming) It was a challenge, but it was a good challenge. It was fun. I think just reacting to tennis balls and a man who had a blue suit on was hard for me, but I had seen paintings of all these mythical Terabithian creatures. So I really tried to visualize them when I was acting in the scene, so I could act like they were attacking me, and feel like if the thing was "this big" or "this big," I would vary how much I would react. 
AnnaSophia: (about Johnny Depp) He's great, yeah he was really wonderful. He's the sweetest guy. He just makes you feel really comfortable.
AnnaSophia: (about her audition for Winn-Dixie) I didn't think I would get the part. I thought I did a horrible job. I was like I'm not going to get the part. I just knew I wasn't. I did.
AnnaSophia: (about Tim Burton) He's the most brilliant man. He has an imagination that just goes off the charts. Most people think Tim Burton is pretty weird, but he's not. He's really normal. He has funny hair and he wears really cool glasses.
AnnaSophia: I started screaming! I was jumping up and screaming and running around. I was so excited because I had only been in acting for about a year, and I had gotten my first big film. So I was really excited.
AnnaSophia: I love performing in front of people. I love meeting people, nice people. I don't just want to do acting. I want to do acting and study chemistry.
AnnaSophia: (about her commercials) I thought it was kind of normal. Most people think it's kind of weird. I didn't think it was that odd. I knew I had filmed it, and I thought it was okay.
