=======================================================
The Honourable Nigella Lucy Lawson (born 6 January 1960) is an English journalist, broadcaster, television personality, gourmet, and food writer. She is the daughter of Nigel Lawson, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Vanessa (née Salmon) Lawson, whose family owned the J. Lyons and Co. food and catering business. After graduating from Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University, Lawson started work as a book reviewer and restaurant critic, later becoming the deputy literary editor of The Sunday Times in 1986. She then embarked upon a career as a freelance journalist, writing for a number of newspapers and magazines. In 1998, she brought out her first cook book, How to Eat, which sold 300,000 copies and became a best-seller. She wrote her second book in 2000, How to be a Domestic Goddess, which won her the British Book Award for Author of the Year.
In 1999, she hosted her own cooking show series, Nigella Bites, on Channel 4, accompanied by another best-selling cook book. Nigella Bites won Lawson a Guild of Food Writers Award; her 2005 ITV daytime chat show Nigella was met with a negative critical reaction and was cancelled after attracting low ratings. She hosted the Food Network's Nigella Feasts in the United States in 2006 followed by a three-part BBC Two series, Nigella's Christmas Kitchen, in the UK, which led to the commissioning of Nigella Express on BBC Two in 2007. Her own cookware range, Living Kitchen, has a value of £7 million, and she has sold more than 3 million cook books worldwide to date.
Lawson was born in London, one of the daughters of Nigel Lawson, Baron Lawson of Blaby,[3] a former Conservative MP, and a former Chancellor of the Exchequer in Margaret Thatcher's government, and his first wife, Vanessa (née Salmon; 1936–1985),[4] a socialite, "celebrated beauty"[5] and heiress to the J. Lyons and Co. fortune.[6] Her parents both came from Jewish families.[7][8][9] Her given name was originally suggested by her grandmother.[10] Her family kept homes in Kensington and Chelsea,[11] and were noted for their luxurious life-style.[12]
Nigel and Vanessa Lawson divorced in 1980. They both remarried; her father in 1980 to a House of Commons researcher, Therese Maclear (to whom he was married until 2008),[13] and her mother, in the early 1980s, to philosopher, A. J. Ayer (they remained married until her mother's death).[6] As her father, Nigel, is a prominent political figure, some of the things she found frustrating were the judgements and pre-conceptions about her.[10] Lawson did not get on well with her father during her parents' divorce, and she became friendly with her mother only when she reached adulthood.[14] She has attributed her unhappiness as a child, in part, to the problematic relationship she had with her mother.[11]
Lawson's mother died of liver cancer in Westminster, London at the age of 48.[6][15] Her full-blood siblings are her brother, Dominic, former editor of The Sunday Telegraph, a sister, Horatia and sister Thomasina, who died of breast cancer in 1993 during her early thirties;[16][17][18] She has a half-brother Tom, and a half-sister Emily, her father's children by his second wife. Lawson is a cousin to both George Monbiot and Fiona Shackleton through the Salmon family.[19]
Taking part in the third series of the BBC family-history documentary series, Who Do You Think You Are?, Lawson sought to uncover some of her family's ancestry. She traced her ancestors to Ashkenazi Jews who originate from eastern Europe and Germany, leaving Lawson surprised not to have Iberian-Sephardi ancestry in the family as she had believed.[20] She also uncovered that her maternal great-great-great grandfather, Coenraad Sammes (later Coleman Joseph), had fled to England from Amsterdam in 1830 to escape a prison sentence following a conviction for theft.[20][21] It was his daughter, Hannah, who married Samuel Gluckstein, father-in-law and business partner of Barnett Salmon and father of Isidore and Montague Gluckstein, who together with Barnett founded J. Lyons and Co. in 1887.[20][22]
Lawson's school years were difficult; she had to move schools nine times between the ages of 9 and 18, spending some of her childhood in the Welsh village of Higher Kinnerton. "I was just difficult, disruptive, good at school work, but rude, I suspect, and too highly-strung", Lawson reflected.[16] Her father originally chose not to believe the reports of her disruptive behaviour and thought the school had the wrong person.[14] Lawson reluctantly attended a private school in the Midlands and later attended London's Godolphin and Latymer School sixth form where she began to show skill academically.[14] She worked for many department stores in London,[23] and went on to graduate from the University of Oxford[23] with a degree in medieval and modern languages.[24] She lived in Florence, Italy for a period of time.[15]
Lawson originally worked in publishing, first taking a job under publisher Naim Attallah.[23] At 23, she began her career in journalism after Charles Moore had invited her to write for The Spectator.[23] Her initial work at the magazine consisted of writing book reviews,[25][26] after which period she became a restaurant critic there in 1985.[16] She became the deputy literary editor of The Sunday Times in 1986 at the age of 26.[16][27]
She occasionally drifted into the public's eye, attracting unwanted publicity in 1989 when she admitted voting for Labour in an election as opposed to her father's Conservative Party, and then criticised Margaret Thatcher in print.[6] Regarding her political relationship with her father, Lawson has stated, "My father would never expect me to agree with him about anything in particular and, to be honest, we never talk about politics much."[28]
After her stint at The Sunday Times, she embarked upon a freelance writing career, realising that "I was on the wrong ladder. I didn't want to be an executive, being paid to worry rather than think".[11] In the United Kingdom, she wrote for The Daily Telegraph, the Evening Standard, The Observer and The Times Literary Supplement, and penned a food column for Vogue[29] and a makeup column for The Times Magazine,[11] as well as working with Gourmet and Bon Appétit in the United States.[30] After two weeks working on Talk Radio in 1995, Lawson was sacked after she had stated her shopping was done for her, which was deemed incompatible with the radio station's desired "common touch".[6]
Lawson had an established sense of cooking from her childhood, having had a mother who enjoyed cooking.[11] She conceived the idea of writing a cook book after she observed a dinner party host in tears because of an unset crème caramel.[31] How to Eat (1998),[16] featuring culinary tips on preparation and saving time,[31] sold 300,000 copies in the UK.[25] The Sunday Telegraph dubbed it "the most valuable culinary guide published this decade."[32]
Its successor, How to be a Domestic Goddess (2000), focuses primarily on baking.[15] Of this second bestseller, The Times wrote of Lawson's book, that it "is defined by its intimate, companionable approach. She is not issuing matronly instructions like Delia; she is merely making sisterly suggestions".[11] Lawson rejected feminist criticism of her book,[33] adding that "[s]ome people did take the domestic goddess title literally rather than ironically. It was about the pleasures of feeling like one rather than actually being one."[3] The book sold 180,000 copies in four months,[31] and won Lawson the title of Author of the Year at the British Book Awards in 2001,[25] fending off competition from authors such as J. K. Rowling.[34] How to Eat and How to be a Domestic Goddess were published in the U.S. in 2000 and 2001.[35] As a result of the book's success, The Observer took on her as a social affairs columnist.[16]
Lawson next hosted her own cooking show television series, Nigella Bites, which ran from 1999 to 2001 on Channel 4,[36][37] followed by a Christmas special in 2001.[38] Victor Lewis-Smith, a critic usually known for his biting comments, praised Lawson for being "formidably charismatic".[3] The first series of Nigella Bites averaged 1.9 million viewers,[39] and won her the Television Broadcast of the Year at the Guild of Food Writers Awards[40] and the Best Television Food Show at the World Food Media Awards in 2001.[41] The show yielded an accompanying best-selling recipe book, also called Nigella Bites,[42] for which Waterstone's book stores reported UK sales of over 300,000.[43] The book won a W H Smith Award for Lifestyle Book of the Year.[44]
The Nigella Bites series, which was filmed in her home in west London, was later broadcast on American television on channels E![45] and Style Network.[25] Lawson said of the US release, "In the UK, my viewers have responded to the fact I'm trying to reduce, not add to, their burden and I'm looking forward to making that connection with Style viewers across the US".[45] Overall, Lawson was well received in the United States.[28] Those who did criticise her often suggested she was too flirtatious; a commentator from The New York Times said, "Lawson's sexy roundness mixed with her speed-demon technique makes cooking dinner with Nigella look like a prelude to an orgy".[25] The book of Nigella Bites became the second bestselling cook book of Christmas 2002 in America.[46] The series was followed by Forever Summer with Nigella in 2002 on Channel 4, the concept being, "that you cook to make you still feel as though you're on holiday".[28]
In 2002 she also began to write a fortnightly cooking articles for The New York Times,[4] and brought out a profitable line of kitchenware, called the Living Kitchen range, which is sold by numerous retailers.[29] Her range's value has continued to grow, starting at an estimated £2 million in 2003,[47] and increasing to £7 million in 2007.[48]
In November 2003, Lawson oversaw the menu and preparations for a lunch hosted by Tony Blair at Downing Street for George W. Bush and his wife during their state visit to the UK.[49] Laura Bush is said to be a fan of Lawson's recipes and once included one of her soups as the starter for the 2002 presidential Christmas dinner.[46] Lawson's fifth book, Feast: Food that Celebrates Life, released in 2004,[50] made sales worth £3 million.[51] London's Evening Standard wrote that the book "works both as a practical manual and an engrossing read. ... Nobody else writes so openly about the emotional significance of food."[52] Lawson appeared frequently on American television in 2004, conducting cookery slots on talk shows such as The Ellen DeGeneres Show.[53]
In the UK in 2005, Lawson started to host a daytime television chat show on ITV1 called Nigella, on which celebrity guests joined her in a studio kitchen.[21] The first episode debuted with a disappointing 800,000 viewers.[54] The show was met with a largely negative critical reaction,[55] and after losing 40% of its viewers in the first week, the show was cancelled.[56] She later commented to Radio Times that on her first show, she was almost too frightened to come out of her dressing room.[57] Lawson added that having to pretend to be interested in the lives of the celebrities on her show became too much of an effort.[21] She discovered, "I can't ever be a presenter, and won't do scripts".[58]
Her third food-based television series, called Nigella Feasts, debuted on the USA's Food Network in Autumn 2006 for a 13-week run.[56] Time magazine wrote a favorable review of the show; "the real appeal of Feasts ... is her unfussy, wry, practical approach to entertaining and quality comfort food. ... between the luscious camera shots and Lawson's sensual enjoyment of eating, Feasts will leave you wishing for an invite".[59] Since the American broadcasting, Lawson signed a £2.5 million deal for the series to be shown in ten other countries across the world.[60]
Lawson was next signed to BBC Two to host a three-part cookery show entitled Nigella's Christmas Kitchen, which began on 6 December 2006 and aired weekly. The first two episodes secured the second highest ratings of the week for BBC Two, with the first episode debuting with a strong 3.5 million.[61][62] The final episode went on to become the top show on BBC Two the week that it was aired.[61] Nigella's Christmas Kitchen won Lawson a second World Food Media Award in 2007.[63] Her influence as a food commentator was also demonstrated in late 2006, when after she had lauded goose fat as being an essential ingredient for Christmas, sales percentages of the product increased significantly in the UK. Waitrose and Tesco both stated that goose fat sales had more than doubled, as well as Asda's goose fat sales increasing by 65% from the previous week.[64] Similarly, after she advised using prunes in a recipe on Nigella's Christmas Kitchen, Waitrose had increased sales of 30% year on year.[65][66]
Nigella's Christmas Kitchen led to the commissioning of a 13-part cookery series entitled Nigella Express.[67] The series began to air on BBC Two on 3 September 2007, suggesting ways of making simple and quick dishes.[68] Lawson admitted the recipes were not "particularly healthy",[69] although she added, "I wouldn't describe them as junk".[70] The show became another ratings success and one of BBC Two's top-rated shows each week.[71] The first episode debuted with 2.85 million viewers,[71] a high percentage above the channel's slot average.[72] The second episode's viewing figures rose to 3.3 million,[73] and the series peaked at 3.4 million on 22 October 2007.[74]
Her influence with the public was again demonstrated when sales of Riesling wine increased by 30% in the UK after she had incorporated it into her Coq au Riesling recipe on Nigella Express.[75] Later, a similar trend was seen in the sales figures of the liqueur Advocaat after Lawson had endorsed it on the show.[76]
Lawson came under criticism when viewers complained that she had gained weight since the debut episode of the series.[77] The Guardian however, noted, "the food matches her appearance – flawless, polished and sexy".[78] The rights to Nigella Express have been sold to the Food Network in America,[48] and to Discovery Asia.[79] The series was nominated at the 35th Daytime Emmy Awards in the United States for Outstanding Lifestyle Program, and Lawson herself for the Outstanding Lifestyle Host.[80]
The accompanying book to Nigella Express was released in the UK in September 2007, U.S. in November 2007,[48] and in Australia in 2008.[81] Sharing the same name as the television series, the book became another best-seller in the UK,[82] and was outselling television chef Jamie Oliver by 100,000 copies, according to Waterstone's. It was reported that over 490,000 copies had been sold by mid-December in the UK.[43] Furthermore, the book was number one for a period on Amazon UK's bestselling books,[43] and was ninth on their overall list of Christmas bestsellers in any category.[83] Paul Levy of The Guardian wrote that the tone of the recipes was "just right. One of the appealing things about Nigella's brief introductions to each of them is that she thinks not just as cook, but as eater, and tells you whether they're messy, sticky or fussy."[78] In January 2008, Lawson was estimated to have sold more than 3 million books worldwide.[84] Her Christmas book was released in October 2008 and the television show in December of the same year. An American edition of the book "Nigella Christmas" with a different cover photograph was released in November 2009 with an accompanying book tour of several US cities and a special on the USA's Food Network.[citation needed]

Lawson was featured as one of the three judges on a special battle of Iron Chef America, titled "The Super Chef Battle", which pitted White House Executive Chef Cristeta Comerford and Iron Chef Bobby Flay against chef Emeril Lagasse and Iron Chef Mario Batali. This episode was originally broadcast on 3 January 2010. Lawson's cookbook Kitchen: Recipes from the Heart of the Home (2010) is a tie-in with the TV series "Nigella Kitchen." This was shown in the UK and on the USA's Food Network. The book and series were both critical and financial successes.
Nigellissima: Instant Italian Inspiration (2012) got more criticism in the UK than her previous cookbooks though critics in the USA and Italy were more favourable. The 8 part TV series entitled Nigellissima was broadcast by the BBC. Nigella Lawson obtained work experience in Italy during her gap year. [85]
Lawson traveled to the United States in 2013 and starred alongside Anthony Bourdain in the reality cooking show The Taste. The UK version of the show began airing on 7 January 2014 on Channel 4 but didn't do well in the viewing figures.[citation needed]
In 2014 Lawson was hired by a chocolate company to appear in an advertisement. This was originally scheduled to be filmed in the USA, but Lawson was denied a visa to enter the country, "US authorities declined to specify why Lawson was stopped from flying from London to Los Angeles." The advertisement was filmed in New Zealand in May for a local confection manufacturer Whittaker's, where a work visa has been granted under "special direction" laws. [86] [87] [88]
Though Lawson has enjoyed a successful career in cookery, she is not a trained chef,[89] and does not like being referred to as a "celebrity chef".[10] Furthermore, she does not see herself as a cook or an expert in her field.[15] Throughout Lawson's television programmes,[90] she emphasises that she cooks for her own pleasure,[11] for enjoyment,[3] and that she finds cooking therapeutic. When deciding upon which recipes to feature in her books, she takes the view of the eater, stating, "If it's something I don't want to carry on eating once I'm full, then I don't want the recipe ... I have to feel that I want to cook the thing again".[15]
Lawson has adopted a casual approach to cooking, stating, "I think cooking should be about fun and family. ... I think part of my appeal is that my approach to cooking is really relaxed and not rigid. There are no rules in my kitchen."[89] One editor, highlighting the technical simplicity of Lawson's recipes, noted that "her dishes require none of the elaborate preparation called for by most TV chefs".[91]
Lawson has become renowned for her flirtatious manner of presenting, although she argues "It’s not meant to be flirtatious. ... I don’t have the talent to adopt a different persona. It's intimate, not flirtatious".[21] The perceived overt sexuality of her presentation style has led to Lawson's being called the "queen of food porn".[14][92][93] Many commentators have alluded to Lawson's attractiveness, and she was once named as one of the world's most beautiful women.[15] She has been referred to as "stunningly beautiful, warm, honest, likeable and amazingly normal",[16] as well as being described as having "flawless skin, perfect white teeth, a voluptuous body, ample height and lots of lush, brown hair".[89] The media have also noted Lawson's ability to engage with both male and female viewers;[3][26][94] The Guardian wrote, "Men love her because they want to be with her. Women love her because they want to be her".[10] The chef, Gary Rhodes, spoke out against Lawson by suggesting that her viewers are attracted to her smile rather than the cooking itself.[95] Despite often being labelled as a domestic goddess,[96] she insists that she exhibits very few of the qualities associated with the title.[26][28]
Lawson is also known for her vivid and adjective-filled food descriptions in both her books and television programmes,[97] as one critic summarised, "her descriptions of food can be a tangle of adjectives."[35] In a study conducted in 2007 on the readability of different recipes, the chatty and florid style of Lawson's recipes was judged to be confusing to readers with weak reading skills.[98] Lawson has also expressed her surprise at how many reviews in the United States have mentioned her class and posh accent.[6]
Lawson was in a relationship with human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC until 1988, when he left her for novelist Kathy Lette.[99]
Lawson met journalist John Diamond in 1986, when they were both writing for The Sunday Times.[16] They married in Venice in 1992[14] and have a daughter, Cosima and a son, Bruno.[100][101] Diamond was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1997 and died in March 2001, aged 47.[25] One of his last messages to Lawson was, "How proud I am of you and what you have become. The great thing about us is that we have made us who we are."[3] His death occurred during the filming of Nigella Bites; "I took a fortnight off. But I'm not a great believer in breaks", Lawson explained;[3] however, she suffered a bout of depression following the funeral.[10] After Diamond's death, Lawson kept all of the press clippings in what she called her "Morbidobox".[3]
Lawson married art collector Charles Saatchi in September 2003,[102] having drawn disapproval when she moved in with him nine months after Diamond's death.[14] Nigella Lawson was not always happy for unspecified reasons and admitted in 2012 that she sometimes said, “Please God, get me through the ordeal that is today.” [85]
In June 2013, photographs were published by the Sunday People newspaper of Lawson being grabbed around the neck by Saatchi, during an argument outside a London seafood restaurant.[103][104] According to a witness, Lawson was very distressed by the incident. [105] Saatchi later described the pictures as showing only a "playful tiff" and trying to emphasise a point. [106] [105] After a police investigation of the incident, Saatchi was cautioned for assault, and it was reported that Lawson had left the family home.[107][108] Lawson said in court Saatchi subjected her to "intimate terrorism", that he threatened to finish her unless she cleared him in court.[109] Subsequently while giving evidence Lawson claimed casual cruelty and controlling behaviour by Saatchi which made her unhappy and drove her to occasional drug use. She cited as examples that Saatchi prevented her entertaining at home and punished her for going to a birthday party of a woman friend, she was not beaten but was left emotionally scarred. [110] [111]
Saatchi announced his divorce from Lawson in early July, stating that he had "clearly been a disappointment to Nigella during the last year or so" and the couple had "become estranged and drifted apart". Lawson made no public comment in response;[112] however, court papers showed that it was Lawson who filed for divorce, citing ongoing unreasonable behaviour.[113] On 31 July 2013, seven weeks after the incident, the pair was granted a decree nisi, ending their ten-year marriage.[113] They reached a private financial settlement.[113]
On 27 November 2013, a trial of the former couple's two personal assistants, Italian-born sisters Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo, began in R v Grillo and Grillo. The Grillos were accused of fraudulently using the credit cards of Saatchi's private company.[114][115] During court proceedings in early December, the sisters claimed that Lawson had permitted their use of the credit cards in exchange for their silence regarding her drug use. Questions regarding Lawson's drug use were allowed by the judge as part of the sisters' "bad character" defence. Lawson admitted to taking cocaine and cannabis but denied she had been addicted, stating, "I found it made an intolerable situation tolerable." [116]
On 20 December 2013, the two sisters were acquitted. Scotland Yard confirmed that Ms Lawson would not be the subject of an investigation based on claims made in court that she consumed cocaine; however, the decision will be reviewed if new evidence comes to light.[117] It has been alleged that Charles Saatchi started a smear campaign against Lawson in the British media, through PR man Richard Hillgrove, relating to her drug use that began even before the trial was over.[118][119][120] Lawyers for Lawson have demanded that Hillgrove remove comments about her made in his blog.[121]
Saatchi was worth a reputed £100 million,[122] while Lawson was worth £15 million as of 2007, £8 million of which came from book sales.[60] It widely began circulating in the media in early 2008 that Lawson had been quoted as saying her two children should not inherit any of the fortune.[122] She strongly denied these plans in a statement on her personal website, which read, "Of course I have no intention of leaving my children destitute and starving – rather, this is a story that came from a comment I made about my belief that you have to work in order to learn the value of money".[123]
Although both of Lawson's parents are Jewish,[10] her upbringing was non observant and Lawson herself identifies as an atheist.[14][124] In one of her newspaper articles, she has shown a liberal attitude to sexuality ("most [women] simply have, somewhere, a fantasy about having sex, in a non-defining, non-exclusive way, with other women.")[125] Lawson has said she often partakes in watching football, and is an avid supporter of Chelsea.[126]
Lawson is a supporter of the Lavender Trust which gives support to young women with breast cancer. She first became involved with the charity in 2002 when she baked some lavender cupcakes to be auctioned at a fundraising event, which sold for a significant amount of money. She subsequently featured the recipe in her book, Forever Summer with Nigella.[127]
In December 2008, Lawson caused controversy and was featured in various newspapers for publicly advocating wearing fur. She also remarked that she would love to kill a bear and then wear it.[128][129]
It was revealed by leaked Whitehall documents in 2003 that Lawson declined an OBE from Queen Elizabeth II in 2001.[130] As the daughter of a life peer, Nigella is entitled to the courtesy title of "The Honourable", and is thus styled The Hon. Nigella Lawson; however, she does not use this courtesy title.

Profile of the sexiest television chef ever to grace an apron. She has inspired women to be domestic goddesses, whilst maintaining a thriving career as a journalist and battling personal tragedy.
Daughter of one of the most prominent politicians in Margaret Thatcher's government, Nigel Lawson, the young Nigella was a shy child who, although intelligent, struggled with her schooling. Having moved schools a total of five times by the time she was 18, she eventually secured a place at Oxford to read Medieval and Modern Languages, achieving a Masters degree in the subject.A successful career in journalism followed and she went on to become the deputy literary editor of The Sunday Times, before turning freelance and writing for such publications as The Guardian and Daily Telegraph.Her love of food started to cross-over into her writing when she was asked to write a food column for The Spectator magazine. In 1992, Nigella married fellow journalist and broadcaster John Diamond and the couple had two children, Cosima and Bruno. Diamond was instrumental in encouraging his wife to write and helped shape her image 'make-over'.Published in 1998 her first book, 'How to Eat: The Pleasures and Principles of Good Food', was the springboard to her Channel 4 TV series, 'Nigella Bites'. Thanks to Nigella's unique approach to food and effortless charm, the show became a huge success and the second series was accompanied by another book, which helped push her worldwide book sales past the 1.5 million mark.In 2000, Nigella turned her attentions to the art of baking with the publication of 'How To Be A Domestic Goddess'. The book proved to be another huge success and was voted 'Cookery Book of the Year' by the Guild of Food Writers in 2001.While her career was taking off, Nigella's life was becoming increasingly affected by cancer. Her mother died of cancer of the liver, her sister was lost to breast cancer in 1993 and her husband John died in 2001 after battling the disease for over four years.Having taken time off following the death of her husband, the successful TV series and book formula was repeated in 2002, with 'Forever Summer'.Nigella married the infamous art lover and collector, Charles Saatchi in 2003 and the following year she published a new book, 'Feast: Food That Celebrates'.In 2005, her foray into the world of daytime television was less successful and her show 'Nigella' lost 40 per cent of its audience in the space of a week.However, this ratings glitch is unlikely to dent a career that can boast million selling books, internationally successful cookery shows and her own kitchenware range.She bounced back when her 'Nigella Feasts' aired in the US in autumn 2006. Since then she has signed a £2.5 million deal for the show to be aired in ten other countries.Nigella signed a contract with BBC Two for a three-part series 'Nigella's Christmas Kitchen', which aired weekly from 6 December 2006. This show enjoyed record ratings and Nigella was awarded a second World Food Media award in 2007.Her influence as a food commentator was also proven in 2006 as Waitrose and Tesco saw their sales of goose fat double after she advocated it as an essential ingredient for Christmas.The BBC signed Nigella up for a 13-part series called 'Nigella Express', which started on 3 September 2007. In the show, she showed people how to cook simple and quick dishes, which she admitted were not always healthy. This was another ratings success. The accompanying book, which was released in 2007, became a UK bestseller.She revived 'Nigella's Christmas Kitchen' in 2008 and appeared on the US's 'Top Chef' in 2009 and 'Iron Chef America: Super Chef Battle' in 2010. The same year, Nigella starred in 13 episodes of 'Nigella's Kitchen'.It is thought that her books have now sold over three million copies worldwide and that she is worth $15 million.

      It was revealed in December 2003 that she declined the OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) honor for "her services to journalism and to cookery" in 2001.
      Her father is former British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson and her socialite mother Vanessa Salmon.
      She had her ears pierced when she was 18, but then stopped wearing earrings and let the holes in her ears close up again when she was in her twenties. She finally had them re-pierced in 2007 when her daughter Cosima had hers pierced. In interviews, she's said that her favorite earrings are big hoops, because of the way wearing them makes her feel.
      Gave birth to her 1st child at age 33, a daughter Cosima Thomasina Diamond (aka Cosima Diamond) in December 1993. Child's father is her now late 1st husband, John Diamond.
      Gave birth to her 2nd child at age 36, a son Bruno Paul Diamond (aka Bruno Diamond) in June 1996. Child's father is her now late 1st husband, John Diamond.
      (March 2, 2001) Her husband of 9 years & father of her 2 children, 7-year-old daughter Cosima & 4-year-old son Bruno, John Diamond died from throat cancer at the age of 47.
      Her 2nd husband of 9 years Charles Saatchi filed for divorce from her following the scandal over the publication of pictures showing him clutching her by the throat at a London restaurant on June 9. [July 2013]
      Presenting her own daytime show, for ITV1, called Nigella (2005). Airs at 1:30pm BST weekdays. [July 2005]
      She is from a Jewish family (from Latvia, Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria). Her family's original surname was "Leibson".
      I am not a chef. I am not even a trained or professional cook. My qualification is as an eater.
      If you're on TV, you can't be surprised if someone talks about what you look like. I don't want to be the poster girl for anything in particular, but I don't equate thinness with healthiness, so I don't feel I have to defend having flesh on me. It's really, as the French say, everything in moderation - including moderation.
      People of ten say to me, You don't wear your hair up. You haven't got a net. I cook for my children. I grew up eating my mother's hair, and I don't see why they can't grow up eating mine.
      I think a lot of professional chefs have a slightly holy view of women who cook. I don't think you can tell the gender of a person through his or her cooking - except at home, because male home cooks tend to be more show-offy.

=======================================================
Nigella didn't start out in the kitchen, licking spoons and standing by an open fridge. No, she started as a journalist for posh magazine The Spectator before reviewing books.She carried on writing for a while before deciding that she might make a half-decent job of putting a book together herself. Horror novels weren't exactly her cup of tea so 'How to Eat' was born in 1998. It flew of the shelves and shifted over 300,000 copies in total ? not a bad effort by anybody's standards.
Luckily for Nigella there was a huge appetite (do you see what we did there?) for TV chefs and she jumped straight onto the bandwagon with shows like Nigella Express and her famous Christmas specials where we think if you ate everything she suggested you'd quite easily quadruple in size.
When people think of Nigella it isn't necessarily her food which comes to mind. It's more her particular style of presentation, which involves a lot of finger licking and slow, sensual breathing. Not our cup of tea but it probably pulls in the male viewers.
Nigella married John Diamond in 1986 and had two children, Cosima and Bruno. Unfortunately her husband died of throat cancer in 2001. She's now remarried to Charles Saatchi.
Oooh get her ? Nigella is eligible to use 'The Honourable' as a title because she's the daughter of a life peer. Luckily, she chooses not to.

=======================================================
Writer and TV cook Nigella Lawson has the talent, looks and success to attract the envy of millions.  But her life has had its fair share of tragedy, and Chris Jones of the BBC's News Profiles Unit tells how Nigella is intent on living in the present.
She was once introverted, overweight and insecure. Now, to the eye of one well-known journalist, "she has creamy, perfect skin, lustrous hair, a beauty queen's figure and dazzlingly white teeth". 
Another interviewer declared her to be "stunningly beautiful, warm, honest, likeable and amazingly normal". And both observations were made by women. 
Ten weeks after the death of her husband, John Diamond, whose wry  observations on his four-year battle against cancer were chronicled in his column in The Times, Nigella Lawson is chalking up another entry on her superwoman CV.
Another series of her Channel 4 food programme, Nigella Bites, has begun. And the series, being filmed at her home in west London, has also been bought by American television.
At John Diamond's funeral,  his last words to his wife were read to the congregation by Nigella's brother, the editor of  The Sunday Telegraph, Dominic Lawson: "How proud I am of you and what you have become." 
Nigella began with considerable advantages. Her father is the former Conservative chancellor, Nigel Lawson, and her mother was Vanessa Salmon, beautiful socialite and heiress to the Lyons Corner House empire.  Neither of which made Nigella a star pupil at school.
Between the ages of nine and 18, she was moved five times: "I was just difficult, disruptive, good at school work, but rude, I suspect, and too highly-strung." 
She failed her 11-plus by refusing to take a maths paper: "I put my hand up, gave it back and said 'I'm sorry, I don't do this'." When she did eventually secure a place at Oxford, her pleasure was tempered by the break-up of her parents' marriage. 
Among the dreaming spires, she developed a left-leaning political slant, but preferred chow to Mao. "Food is a narcotic", she says. 
While she resented her first name, chosen by her father, his impeccable connections later helped to smooth her way.
Nigella began a restaurant column in The Spectator in 1985 and by the following year had become deputy literary editor of The Sunday Times, where she met John Diamond. They married three years later in Venice. 
Diamond opened her eyes to her full potential. He supervised her "makeover", persuading her to wear more glamorous clothes and make-up.
And he suggested she should write a cookery book, coming up with a title of classic simplicity, How to Eat. 
Nigella went from strength to strength, with a second, award-winning book, How to be a Domestic Goddess, a social affairs column in The Observer, another on make-up in The Times, and her TV appearances, particularly on cookery programmes,  that stimulate many a male appetite. 
But an unwelcome companion, cancer, continued to shadow her progress.  Her mother was in her 40s when she died of cancer of the liver and her sister, Thomasina, was in her 30s when she was killed by breast cancer in 1993. 
Neither loss dulled the shock of  the discovery of John Diamond's cancer four years later, or prepared Nigella Lawson for his death. 
Cooking and eating has always been a refuge for her during times of stress and she says one reason women like her is because she is not thin. 
Now 40, with children Cosima, seven, and four-year-old Bruno, she has put on 6lb since filming for her latest TV series began but is "too much of a slattern" to do anything about it.
It is no secret that her home is not a testament of tidiness to a domestic goddess: "I go round in trainers and horrible clothes without make-up and without brushing my hair."
Nor can she become too energised  by complaints that her flapjacks are difficult to remove from the baking tin, or newspaper gossip about her friendship with the advertising guru, Charles Saatchi, who was a close friend of her husband. 
The brightest light and darkest shade of Nigella Lawson's life has taught her to make the most of her many talents and the wisest modus operandi for living: "I suppose I do think that awful things can happen at any moment, so while they are not happening you may as well be pleased."
