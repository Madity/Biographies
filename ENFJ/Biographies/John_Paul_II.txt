Pope Saint John Paul II (Latin: Ioannes Paulus II), born Karol Józef Wojtyła (Polish: [ˈkarɔl ˈjuzɛf vɔjˈtɨwa]; 18 May 1920 ‒ 2 April 2005), also known as Saint John Paul the Great, was pope of the Catholic Church from 16 October 1978 until his death on 2 April 2005.[3][4] He was the second longest-serving pope in modern history after Pope Pius IX who served for 31 years from 1846 to 1878. Born in Poland, John Paul II was the first non-Italian pope since the Dutch Pope Adrian VI who served from 1522 to 1523.
John Paul II is recognised as helping to end Communist rule in his native Poland and eventually all of Europe.[5] John Paul II significantly improved the Catholic Church's relations with Judaism, Islam, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Anglican Communion. He upheld the Church's teachings against artificial contraception and the ordination of women, supported the Church's Second Vatican Council and its reform, and in general held firm to orthodox Catholic stances.
He was one of the most travelled world leaders in history, visiting 129 countries during his pontificate. As part of his special emphasis on the universal call to holiness, he beatified 1,340 people and canonised 483 saints, more than the combined tally of his predecessors during the preceding five centuries. By the time of his death, he had named most of the College of Cardinals, consecrated or co-consecrated a large number of the world's bishops, and ordained many priests.[6] A key goal of his papacy was to transform and reposition the Catholic Church. His wish was "to place his Church at the heart of a new religious alliance that would bring together Jews, Muslims and Christians in a great [religious] armada."[7][8]
John Paul II's cause for canonisation commenced in 2005 one month after his death with the traditional five-year waiting period waived. On 19 December 2009, John Paul II was proclaimed Venerable by his successor Pope Benedict XVI and was beatified on 1 May 2011 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints attributed one miracle to him, the healing of a French nun from Parkinson's disease. A second miracle, attributed to the late pope, was approved on 2 July 2013 and confirmed by Pope Francis two days later. John Paul II was canonised on 27 April 2014, alongside Pope John XXIII.[9] Like John XXIII, his feast day is not celebrated on the date of his death as is usual, but on the anniversary of his papal inauguration, 22 October 1978.[10]
Karol Józef Wojtyła was born in the Polish town of Wadowice.[11][12] He was the youngest of three children born to Karol Wojtyła (1879–1941), an ethnic Pole,[13] and Emilia Kaczorowska (1884–1929), and whose mother's maiden surname was Scholz.[14] Emilia, who was a schoolteacher, died in childbirth in 1929[15] when Wojtyła was eight years old.[16] His elder sister Olga had died before his birth, but he was close to his brother Edmund, nicknamed Mundek, who was 13 years his senior. Edmund's work as a physician eventually led to his death from scarlet fever, a loss which affected Wojtyła deeply.[13][16]
As a boy, Wojtyła was athletic, often playing football as goalkeeper.[17] During his childhood, Wojtyła had contact with Wadowice's large Jewish community.[18] School football games were often organised between teams of Jews and Catholics, and Wojtyła often played on the Jewish side.[13][17] "I remember that at least a third of my classmates at elementary school in Wadowice were Jews. At elementary school there were fewer. With some I was on very friendly terms. And what struck me about some of them was their Polish patriotism."[19] Wojtyła's first, and possibly only, love affair was with a Jewish girl, Ginka Beer, who was described as "slender", "a superb actress" and "having stupendous dark eyes and jet black hair".[8][18]
In mid-1938, Wojtyła and his father left Wadowice and moved to Kraków, where he enrolled at the Jagiellonian University. While studying such topics as philology and various languages, he worked as a volunteer librarian and was required to participate in compulsory military training in the Academic Legion, but he refused to fire a weapon. He performed with various theatrical groups and worked as a playwright.[20] During this time, his talent for language blossomed, and he learned as many as 12 foreign languages,[21] nine of which he used extensively as pope.
In 1939, Nazi German occupation forces closed the university after invading Poland.[11] Able-bodied males were required to work, so from 1940 to 1944 Wojtyła variously worked as a messenger for a restaurant, a manual labourer in a limestone quarry and for the Solvay chemical factory, to avoid deportation to Germany.[12][20] His father, a former Austro-Hungarian non-commissioned officer and later officer in the Polish Army, died of a heart attack in 1941,[14] leaving Wojtyła as the immediate family's only surviving member.[13][15][22] "I was not at my mother's death, I was not at my brother's death, I was not at my father's death," he said, reflecting on these times of his life, nearly forty years later, "At twenty, I had already lost all the people I loved."[22]
After his father's death, he started thinking seriously about the priesthood.[23] In October 1942, while the war continued, he knocked on the door of the Bishop's Palace in Kraków and asked to study for the priesthood.[23] Soon after, he began courses in the clandestine underground seminary run by the Archbishop of Kraków, Adam Stefan Cardinal Sapieha. On 29 February 1944, Wojtyła was hit by a German truck. German Wehrmacht officers tended to him and sent him to a hospital. He spent two weeks there recovering from a severe concussion and a shoulder injury. It seemed to him that this accident and his survival was a confirmation of his vocation. On 6 August 1944, a day known as 'Black Sunday',[24] the Gestapo rounded up young men in Kraków to curtail the uprising, [24] similar to the recent uprising in Warsaw.[25][26] Wojtyła escaped by hiding in the basement of his uncle's house at 10 Tyniecka Street, while the German troops searched above.[23][25][26] More than eight thousand men and boys were taken that day, while Wojtyła escaped to the Archbishop's Palace,[23][24][25] where he remained until after the Germans had left.[13][23][25]
On the night of 17 January 1945, the Germans fled the city, and the students reclaimed the ruined seminary. Wojtyła and another seminarian volunteered for the task of clearing away piles of frozen excrement from the toilets.[27] Wojtyła also helped a 14-year-old Jewish refugee girl named Edith Zierer,[28] who had run away from a Nazi labour camp in Częstochowa.[28] Edith had collapsed on a railway platform, so Wojtyła carried her to a train and stayed with her throughout the journey to Kraków. Edith credits Wojtyła with saving her life that day.[29][30][31] B'nai B'rith and other authorities have said that Wojtyła helped protect many other Polish Jews from the Nazis. During the Nazi occupation of Poland, a Jewish family sent its son, Stanley Berger, to be hidden by a Gentile Polish family. Berger's biological Jewish parents died during the Holocaust, and after the war Berger's new Christian parents asked a young Polish priest named Karol Wojtyla, the future Pope John Paul II, to baptise the boy. The future pope refused, claiming that the child should be raised in the Jewish faith of his birth parents and nation, not as a Catholic.[32] In September 2003, Emmanuelle Pacifici, the head of Italy's Jewish community, proposed that John Paul II receive the medal of a Righteous Among the Nations for saving a two-year-old Jewish boy by giving him to a Gentile Polish family to be hidden in 1942, when Karol Wojtyla was just a seminarian. After the war, this boy's Christian adopted parents asked the future Pope John Paul II to baptise the boy, yet once again he refused, as with Berger. After the war, Karol Wojtyla did everything he could to ensure that this Jewish boy he saved leave Poland to be raised by his Jewish relatives in the United States.[33] In April 2005, shortly after John Paul II's death, the Israeli government created a commission to honour the legacy of John Paul II. One of the proposed ways of honouring him was to give him the medal of the Righteous Among the Nations.[34] In Wojtyła's last book, Memory and Identity, he described the 12 years of the Nazi régime as 'bestiality',[35] quoting from the Polish theologian and philosopher Konstanty Michalski.[36]
On finishing his studies at the seminary in Kraków, Wojtyła was ordained as a priest on All Saints' Day, 1 November 1946,[15] by the Archbishop of Kraków, Cardinal Sapieha.[12][37][38] Sapieha sent Wojtyła to Rome's Pontifical International Athenaeum Angelicum, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum to study under the French Dominican Fr. Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange beginning on 26 November 1946. Wojtyła earned a licence in July 1947, passed his doctoral exam on 14 June 1948, and successfully defended his doctoral thesis entitled Doctrina de fide apud S. Ioannem a Cruce (The Doctrine of Faith in St. John of the Cross) in philosophy on 19 June 1948.[39] The Angelicum preserves the original copy of Wojtyła's typewritten thesis.[40] Among other courses at the Angelicum, Wojtyła studied Hebrew with the Dutch Dominican Peter G. Duncker, author of the Compendium grammaticae linguae hebraicae biblicae.[41]
According to Wojtyła's schoolmate the future Austrian Cardinal Alfons Stickler, in 1947 during his sojourn at the Angelicum Wojtyła visited Padre Pio who heard his confession and told him that one day he would ascend to "the highest post in the Church."[42] Cardinal Stickler added that Wojtyła believed that the prophecy was fulfilled when he became a Cardinal.[43]
Wojtyła returned to Poland in the summer of 1948 for his first pastoral assignment in the village of Niegowić, fifteen miles (24 km) from Kraków, at the Church of the Assumption. He arrived at Niegowić at harvest time, where his first action was to kneel and kiss the ground.[44] This gesture, which he adapted from the French saint Jean Marie Baptiste Vianney,[44] would become a 'trademark' action during his papacy.
In March 1949, Wojtyła was transferred to the parish of Saint Florian in Kraków. He taught ethics at Jagiellonian University and subsequently at the Catholic University of Lublin. While teaching, he gathered a group of about 20 young people, who began to call themselves Rodzinka, the "little family". They met for prayer, philosophical discussion, and to help the blind and sick. The group eventually grew to approximately 200 participants, and their activities expanded to include annual skiing and kayaking trips.[45]
In 1953, Wojtyła's habilitation thesis was accepted by the Faculty of Theology at the Jagiellonian University. In 1954, he earned a Doctorate in Sacred Theology,[46] evaluating the feasibility of a Catholic ethic based on the ethical system of the phenomenologist Max Scheler with a dissertation entitled "Reevaluation of the possibility of founding a Catholic ethic on the ethical system of Max Scheler"[47] (Ocena możliwości zbudowania etyki chrześcijańskiej przy założeniach systemu Maksa Schelera).[48] Scheler was a German philosopher who founded a broad philosophical movement which emphasised the study of conscious experience. However, the Communist authorities abolished the Faculty of Theology at the Jagellonian University thereby preventing him from receiving the degree until 1957.[38] Wojtyła developed a theological approach which combined traditional Catholic Thomism with the ideas of personalism, a philosophical approach deriving from phenomenology, which was popular among Catholic intellectuals in Kraków during Wojtyła's intellectual development. He translated Scheler's Formalism and the Ethics of Substantive Values.[49]
During this period, Wojtyła wrote a series of articles in Kraków's Catholic newspaper, Tygodnik Powszechny ("Universal Weekly"), dealing with contemporary church issues.[50] He focused on creating original literary work during his first dozen years as a priest. War, life under Communism, and his pastoral responsibilities all fed his poetry and plays. Wojtyła published his work under two pseudonyms — Andrzej Jawień and Stanisław Andrzej Gruda[20][50] — to distinguish his literary from his religious writings (under his own name), and also so that his literary works would be considered on their merits.[20][50] In 1960, Wojtyła published the influential theological book Love and Responsibility, a defence of traditional Church teachings on marriage from a new philosophical standpoint.[20][51]
While a priest in Kraków, groups of students regularly joined Wojtyła for hiking, skiing, bicycling, camping and kayaking, accompanied by prayer, outdoor Masses and theological discussions. In Stalinist-era Poland, it was not permitted for priests to travel with groups of students. Father Wojtyła asked his younger companions to call him "Wujek" (Polish for "Uncle") to prevent outsiders from deducing he was a priest. The nickname gained popularity among his followers. In 1958, when Wojtyła was named auxiliary bishop of Kraków, his acquaintances expressed concern that this would cause him to change. Wojtyła responded to his friends, "Wujek will remain Wujek," and he continued to live a simple life, shunning the trappings that came with his position as Bishop. This beloved nickname stayed with Wojtyła for his entire life and continues to be affectionately used, particularly by the Polish people.[52][53]
On 4 July 1958,[38] while Wojtyła was on a kayaking holiday in the lakes region of northern Poland, Pope Pius XII appointed him as the Auxiliary Bishop of Kraków. He was then summoned to Warsaw to meet the Primate of Poland, Stefan Cardinal Wyszyński, who informed him of his appointment.[54][55] He agreed to serve as Auxiliary Bishop to Kraków's Archbishop Eugeniusz Baziak, and he was ordained to the Episcopate (as Titular Bishop of Ombi) on 28 September 1958. Baziak was the principal consecrator. Principal co-consecrators were then-Auxiliary Bishop Boleslaw Kominek (Titular Bishop of Sophene and Vaga; of the Catholic Archdiocese of Wrocław and future Cardinal Archbishop of Wrocław) and then-Auxiliary Bishop Franciszek Jop of the Catholic Diocese of Sandomierz (Titular Bishop of Daulia; later Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Wrocław and then Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Opole).[38] At the age of 38, Wojtyła became the youngest bishop in Poland. Baziak died in June 1962 and on 16 July Wojtyła was selected as Vicar Capitular (temporary administrator) of the Archdiocese until an Archbishop could be appointed.[11][12]
In October 1962, Wojtyła took part in the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965),[11][38] where he made contributions to two of its most historic and influential products, the Decree on Religious Freedom (in Latin, Dignitatis Humanae) and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (Gaudium et Spes).[38] Wojtyła and the Polish bishops contributed a draft text to the Council for Gaudium et Spes. According to the historian John W. O'Malley, the draft text Gaudium et Spes which Wojtyła and the Polish delegation sent "had some influence on the version that was sent to the council fathers that summer but was not accepted as the base text".[56] According to John F. Crosby, as pope, John Paul II used the words of Gaudium et Spes later to introduce his own views on the nature of the human person in relation to God: man is "the only creature on earth that God has wanted for its own sake", but man "can fully discover his true self only in a sincere giving of himself".[57]
He also participated in the assemblies of the Synod of Bishops.[11][12] On 13 January 1964, Pope Paul VI appointed him Archbishop of Kraków.[58] On 26 June 1967, Paul VI announced Archbishop Karol Wojtyła's promotion to the Sacred College of Cardinals.[38][58] Wojtyła was named Cardinal-Priest of the titulus of San Cesareo in Palatio.
In 1967, he was instrumental in formulating the encyclical Humanae Vitae, which dealt with the same issues that forbid abortion and artificial birth control.[38][59][60]
In 1970, according to a contemporary witness, Cardinal Wojtyła was against the distribution of a letter around Kraków, stating that the Polish Episcopate was preparing for the 50th anniversary of the Polish-Soviet War.

In August 1978, following the death of Pope Paul VI, Cardinal Wojtyła voted in the Papal conclave which elected Pope John Paul I. John Paul I died after only 33 days as pope, triggering another conclave.[12][38][61]
The second conclave of 1978 started on 14 October, ten days after the funeral. It was split between two strong candidates for the papacy: Giuseppe Cardinal Siri, the conservative Archbishop of Genoa, and the liberal Archbishop of Florence, Giovanni Cardinal Benelli, a close friend of John Paul I.[62]
Supporters of Benelli were confident that he would be elected, and in early ballots, Benelli came within nine votes of success.[62] However, both men faced sufficient opposition for neither to be likely to prevail. Giovanni Colombo, the Archbishop of Milan was considered as a compromise candidate among the Italian cardinal-electors, but when he started to receive votes, he announced that if elected he would decline to accept the papacy.[63] Franz Cardinal König, Archbishop of Vienna, suggested to his fellow electors another compromise candidate: the Polish Cardinal Karol Józef Wojtyła.[62] Wojtyła won on the eighth ballot on the third day (16 October) with, according to the Italian press, 99 votes from the 111 participating electors. He subsequently chose the name John Paul II[38][62] in honour of his immediate predecessor and also in honour of the late Pope Paul VI, and the traditional white smoke informed the crowd gathered in St. Peter's Square that a pope had been chosen. There had been rumours that the new pope wished to be known as Pope Stanislaus I in honour of the Polish saint of the name, but was convinced by the cardinals that it was not a Roman name.[61] He accepted his election with these words: 'With obedience in faith to Christ, my Lord, and with trust in the Mother of Christ and the Church, in spite of great difficulties, I accept.'[64][65] When the new pontiff appeared on the balcony, he broke tradition by addressing the gathered crowd:[64]
Dear brothers and sisters, we are saddened at the death of our beloved Pope John Paul I, and so the cardinals have called for a new bishop of Rome. They called him from a faraway land — far and yet always close because of our communion in faith and Christian traditions. I was afraid to accept that responsibility, yet I do so in a spirit of obedience to the Lord and total faithfulness to Mary, our most Holy Mother. I am speaking to you in your — no, our Italian language. If I make a mistake, please kirrect  [sic] me...[64][66]
Wojtyła became the 264th pope according to the chronological list of popes, the first non-Italian in 455 years.[67] At only 58 years of age, he was the youngest pope since Pope Pius IX in 1846, who was 54.[38] Like his predecessor, Pope Saint John Paul II dispensed with the traditional Papal coronation and instead received ecclesiastical investiture with the simplified Papal inauguration on 22 October 1978. During his inauguration, when the cardinals were to kneel before him to take their vows and kiss his ring, he stood up as the Polish prelate Stefan Cardinal Wyszyński knelt down, stopped him from kissing the ring, and simply hugged him.[68]

During his pontificate, Pope John Paul II made trips to 129 countries,[70] travelling more than 1,100,000 kilometres (680,000 mi) whilst doing so. He consistently attracted large crowds, some among the largest ever assembled in human history, such as the Manila World Youth Day, which gathered up to four million people, the largest Papal gathering ever, according to the Vatican.[71][72] John Paul II's earliest official visits were to the Dominican Republic and Mexico in January 1979.[73] While some of his trips (such as to the United States and the Holy Land) were to places previously visited by Pope Paul VI, John Paul II became the first pope to visit the White House in October 1979, where he was greeted warmly by then-President Jimmy Carter. He was the first pope ever to visit several countries in one year, starting in 1979 with Mexico[74] and Ireland.[75] He was the first reigning pope to travel to the United Kingdom, in 1982, where he met Queen Elizabeth II, the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. While in England, he also visited Canterbury Cathedral and knelt in prayer with Robert Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury, at the spot where Thomas a Becket had been killed.[76]
He travelled to Haiti in 1983, where he spoke in Creole to thousands of impoverished Catholics gathered to greet him at the airport. His message, "things must change in Haiti", referring to the disparity between the wealthy and the poor, was met with thunderous applause.[77] In 2000, he was the first modern pope to visit Egypt,[78] where he met with the Coptic pope, Pope Shenouda III[78] and the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria.[78] He was the first Catholic pope to visit and pray in an Islamic mosque, in Damascus, Syria, in 2001. He visited the Umayyad Mosque, a former Christian church where John the Baptist is believed to be interred,[79] where he made a speech calling for Muslims, Christians and Jews to live together.[79]
On 15 January 1995, during the X World Youth Day, he offered Mass to an estimated crowd of between five and seven million in Luneta Park,[72] Manila, Philippines, which was considered to be the largest single gathering in Christian history.[72] In March 2000, while visiting Jerusalem, John Paul became the first pope in history to visit and pray at the Western Wall.[80][81] In September 2001, amid post-11 September concerns, he travelled to Kazakhstan, with an audience largely consisting of Muslims, and to Armenia, to participate in the celebration of 1,700 years of Armenian Christianity.[82]
In June 1979, Pope John Paul II travelled to Poland where ecstatic crowds constantly surrounded him.[83] This first trip to Poland uplifted the nation's spirit and sparked the formation of the Solidarity movement in 1980, which later brought freedom and human rights to his troubled homeland.[59] Poland's Communist leaders intended to use the Pope's visit to show the people that even though the Pope was Polish it did not alter their capacity to govern, oppress, and distribute the goods of society. They also hoped that if the Pope abided by the rules they set, that the Polish people would see his example and follow them as well. If the Pope's visit inspired a riot, the Communist leaders of Poland were prepared to crush the uprising and blame the suffering on the Pope.[84]
"The Pope won that struggle by transcending politics. His was what Joseph Nye calls 'soft power' — the power of attraction and repulsion. He began with an enormous advantage, and exploited it to the utmost: He headed the one institution that stood for the polar opposite of the Communist way of life that the Polish people hated. He was a Pole, but beyond the regime's reach. By identifying with him, Poles would have the chance to cleanse themselves of the compromises they had to make to live under the regime. And so they came to him by the millions. They listened. He told them to be good, not to compromise themselves, to stick by one another, to be fearless, and that God is the only source of goodness, the only standard of conduct. 'Be not afraid,' he said. Millions shouted in response, 'We want God! We want God! We want God!' The regime cowered. Had the Pope chosen to turn his soft power into the hard variety, the regime might have been drowned in blood. Instead, the Pope simply led the Polish people to desert their rulers by affirming solidarity with one another. The Communists managed to hold on as despots a decade longer. But as political leaders, they were finished. Visiting his native Poland in 1979, Pope John Paul II struck what turned out to be a mortal blow to its Communist regime, to the Soviet Empire, [and] ultimately to Communism."[84]
According to John Lewis Gaddis, one of the most influential historians of the Cold War, the trip led to the formation of Solidarity and would begin the process of Communism's demise in Eastern Europe:
When Pope John Paul II kissed the ground at the Warsaw airport he began the process by which communism in Poland – and ultimately elsewhere in Europe – would come to an end.[85]
On later trips to Poland, he gave tacit support to the Solidarity organisation.[59] These visits reinforced this message and contributed to the collapse of East European Communism that took place between 1989/1990 with the reintroduction of democracy in Poland, and which then spread through Eastern Europe (1990–1991) and South-Eastern Europe (1990–1992).[66][70][83][86][87]
As pope, John Paul II wrote 14 papal encyclicals and taught about sexuality in what is referred as the "Theology of the Body". Some key elements of his strategy to "reposition the Catholic Church" were encyclicals such as Ecclesia de Eucharistia, Reconciliatio et Paenitentia and Redemptoris Mater. In his At the beginning of the new millennium (Novo Millennio Ineunte), he emphasised the importance of "starting afresh from Christ": "No, we shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person." In The Splendour of the Truth (Veritatis Splendor), he emphasised the dependence of man on God and His Law ("Without the Creator, the creature disappears") and the "dependence of freedom on the truth". He warned that man "giving himself over to relativism and scepticism, goes off in search of an illusory freedom apart from truth itself". In Fides et Ratio (On the Relationship between Faith and Reason) John Paul promoted a renewed interest in philosophy and an autonomous pursuit of truth in theological matters. Drawing on many different sources (such as Thomism), he described the mutually supporting relationship between faith and reason, and emphasised that theologians should focus on that relationship. John Paul II wrote extensively about workers and the social doctrine of the Church, which he discussed in three encyclicals: Laborem Exercens, Solicitudo Rei Socialis, and Centesimus Annus. Through his encyclicals and many Apostolic Letters and Exhortations, John Paul II talked about the dignity of women and the importance of the family for the future of humanity.[59] Other encyclicals include The Gospel of Life (Evangelium Vitae) and Ut Unum Sint (That They May Be One). Though critics accused him of inflexibility in explicitly re-asserting Catholic moral teachings against abortion and euthanasia that have been in place for well over a thousand years, he urged a more nuanced view of capital punishment.[59] In his second encyclical Dives in misericordia he stressed that divine mercy is the greatest feature of God, needed especially nowadays. According to that, he gave to the new millennium in 2000 saint Faustina and (on the same day) the Divine Mercy Sunday. During his last visit in the fatherland, in Kraków-, he entrusted the world to the divine mercy.[88]
John Paul II was considered a conservative on doctrine and issues relating to sexual reproduction and the ordination of women.[89]
While the Pope was visiting the United States of America he said, "All human life, from the moments of conception and through all subsequent stages, is sacred."[90]
A series of 129 lectures given by John Paul II during his Wednesday audiences in Rome between September 1979 and November 1984 were later compiled and published as a single work entitled Theology of the Body, an extended meditation on human sexuality. He extended it to the condemnation of abortion, euthanasia and virtually all capital punishment,[91] calling them all a part of the "culture of death" that is pervasive in the modern world. He campaigned for world debt forgiveness and social justice.[59][89] He coined the term "social mortgage", which related that all private property had a social dimension, namely, that "the goods of this are originally meant for all."[92] In 2000, he publicly endorsed the Jubilee 2000 campaign on African debt relief fronted by Irish rock stars Bob Geldof and Bono, once famously interrupting a U2 recording session by telephoning the studio and asking to speak to Bono.[93]
Pope John Paul II, who was present and very influential at Vatican II (1962–65), affirmed the teachings of that Council and did much to implement them. Nevertheless, his critics often wished that he would embrace the so-called "progressive" agenda that some hoped would evolve as a result of the Council. In fact, the Council did not advocate "progressive" changes in these areas; for example, they still condemned abortion as an unspeakable crime. Pope John Paul II continued to declare that contraception, abortion, and homosexual acts were gravely sinful, and, with Joseph Ratzinger (future Pope Benedict XVI), opposed Liberation theology.
Following the Church's exaltation of the marital act of sexual intercourse between a baptised man and woman within sacramental marriage as proper and exclusive to the sacrament of marriage, John Paul II believed that it was, in every instance, profaned by contraception, abortion, divorce followed by a 'second' marriage, and by homosexual acts. His beliefs were often assumed to be a rejection of women. In 1994, John Paul II asserted the Church's lack of authority to ordain women to the priesthood, stating that without such authority ordination is not legitimately compatible with fidelity to Christ. This was also deemed a repudiation of calls to break with the constant tradition of the Church by ordaining women to the priesthood.[94] In addition, John Paul II chose not to end the discipline of mandatory priestly celibacy, although in a small number of unusual circumstances, he did allow certain married clergymen of other Christian traditions who later became Catholic to be ordained as Catholic priests..
Pope John Paul II was an outspoken opponent of apartheid in South Africa. In 1985, while visiting the Netherlands, he gave an impassioned speech condemning apartheid at the International Court of Justice, proclaiming that "no system of apartheid or separate development will ever be acceptable as a model for the relations between peoples or races."[95] In September 1988, Pope John Paul II made a pilgrimage to ten countries bordering South Africa, while demonstratively avoiding South Africa. During his visit to Zimbabwe, John Paul II called for economic sanctions against South Africa's government.[96] After John Paul II's death, both Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu praised the Pope for defending human rights and condemning economic injustice.[97]
Pope John Paul II was an outspoken opponent of the death penalty, although previous popes had accepted the practice. At a papal mass in St. Louis, Missouri, in the United States he said:
A sign of hope is the increasing recognition that the dignity of human life must never be taken away, even in the case of someone who has done great evil. Modern society has the means of protecting itself, without definitively denying criminals the chance to reform. I renew the appeal I made most recently at Christmas for a consensus to end the death penalty, which is both cruel and unnecessary.[98]
During that visit, John Paul II convinced the then governor of Missouri, Mel Carnahan, to reduce the death sentence of convicted murderer Darrell J. Mease to life imprisonment without parole.[99] John Paul II's other attempts to reduce the sentence of death-row inmates were unsuccessful. In 1983, John Paul II visited Guatemala and unsuccessfully asked the country's president, Efraín Ríos Montt, to reduce the sentence for six left-wing guerrillas sentenced to death.[100]
In 2002, John Paul II again traveled to Guatemala. At that time, Guatemala was one of only two countries in Latin America (the other being Cuba) to apply capital punishment. John Paul II asked to the Guatemalan president, Alfonso Portillo, for a moratorium on executions. [101]
Pope John Paul II pushed for a reference to Europe's Christian cultural roots in the draft of the European Constitution. In his 2003 apostolic exhortation Ecclesia in Europa, John Paul II wrote that he "fully (respected) the secular nature of (European) institutions." However, he wanted the EU Constitution to enshrine religious rights, including acknowledging the rights of religious groups to organise freely, recognise the specific identity of each denomination and allow for a "structured dialogue" between each religious community and the EU, and extend across the European Union the legal status enjoyed by religious institutions in individual member states. "I wish once more to appeal to those drawing up the future European Constitutional Treaty so that it will include a reference to the religion and in particular to the Christian heritage of Europe," John Paul II said. The pope's desire for a reference to Europe's Christian identity in the Constitution was supported by non-Catholic representatives of the Church of England and Orthodox Churches from Russia, Romania, and Greece.[102] John Paul II's demand to include a reference to Europe's Christian roots in the European Constitution was supported even by non-Christians, such as Joseph Weiler, a pious Orthodox Jew and renowned constitutional lawyer, who said that the Constitution's lack of a reference to Christianity was not a "demonstration of neutrality," but, rather, "a Jacobin attitude."[103]
At the same time, however, John Paul II was an enthusiastic supporter of European integration; in particular, he supported his native Poland's entry into the bloc. On 19 May 2003, three weeks before a referendum was held in Poland on EU membership, the Polish pope addressed his compatriots and urged them to vote for Poland's EU membership at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City State. While some conservative, Catholic politicians in Poland opposed EU membership, John Paul II said:
I know that there are many in opposition to integration. I appreciate their concern about maintaining the cultural and religious identity of our nation. However, I must emphasise that Poland has always been an important part of Europe. Europe needs Poland. The Church in Europe needs the Poles' testimony of faith. Poland needs Europe.[104]
The Polish pope compared Poland's entry into the EU to the Union of Lublin, which was signed in 1564 and united the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into one nation and created an elective monarchy.[105]
On 22 October 1996, in a speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences plenary session at the Vatican, Pope Saint John Paul II said of evolution that "this theory has been progressively accepted by researchers, following a series of discoveries in various fields of knowledge. The convergence, neither sought nor fabricated, of the results of work that was conducted independently is in itself a significant argument in favour of this theory." Although generally accepting the theory of evolution, John Paul II made one major exception — the human soul. "If the human body has its origin in living material which pre-exists it, the spiritual soul is immediately created by God".[106][107][108]
In 2003, Pope Saint John Paul II also became a prominent critic of the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq. In his 2003 State of the World address, the Pope declared his opposition to the invasion by stating, "No to war! War is not always inevitable. It is always a defeat for humanity."[109] He sent Pío Cardinal Laghi, the former Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to the United States, to talk with George W. Bush, the American President, to express opposition to the war. Pope Saint John Paul II said that it was up to the United Nations to solve the international conflict through diplomacy and that a unilateral aggression is a crime against peace and a violation of international law. The Pope's opposition to the Iraq War led to him being a frontrunner to win 2003 Nobel Peace Prize which was ultimately awarded to Iranian attorney/judge and noted human rights advocate, Shirin Ebadi.[110][111]
In 1984 and 1986, through leader of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), John Paul II officially condemned aspects of Liberation theology, which had many followers in South America. Visiting Europe, Óscar Romero unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a Vatican condemnation of El Salvador's regime, for violations of human rights and its support of death squads. In his travel to Managua, Nicaragua, in 1983, John Paul II harshly condemned what he dubbed the "popular Church"[112] (i.e. "ecclesial base communities" supported by the CELAM), and the Nicaraguan clergy's tendencies to support the leftist Sandinistas, reminding the clergy of their duties of obedience to the Holy See.[112] During that visit Ernesto Cardenal, a priest and minister in the Sandinista government, knelt to kiss his hand. John Paul withdrew it, wagged his finger in Cardenal's face, and told him, "You must straighten out your position with the church."[113]
Pope John Paul II was the first pontiff to actively fight against Mafia violence in Southern Italy. In 1993, during a pilgrimage to Agrigento, Sicily, he appealed to the mafiosi: "I say to those responsible: Convert! One day, the judgment of God will arrive!" In 1994, John Paul II visited Catania and told victims of mafia violence to "rise up and cloak yourself in light and justice!"[114] In 1995, the mafia bombed two historical churches in Rome. Some believed that this was the mob's vendetta against the pope, who had denounced organised crime.[115]
Between 1990 and 1991, a 34-nation coalition led by the United States waged a war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which had invaded and annexed Kuwait. Pope John Paul II was a staunch opponent of the Gulf War. Throughout the conflict, he appealed to the international community to stop the war, and after it was over led diplomatic initiatives to negotiate peace in the Middle East.[116] In his 1991 encyclical Centesimus Annus, John Paul II harshly condemned the conflict:
No, never again war, which destroys the lives of innocent people, teaches how to kill, throws into upheaval even the lives of those who do the killing and leaves behind a trail of resentment and hatred, thus making it all the more difficult to find a just solution of the very problems which provoked the war.[117]
In April 1991, during his Urbi et Orbi Sunday message at St. Peter's Basilica, Pope Saint John Paul II called for the international community to "lend an ear" to "the long-ignored aspirations of oppressed peoples." Pope Saint John Paul II specifically named the Kurds, a people who were fighting a civil war against Saddam Hussein's troops in Iraq, as one such people. He referred to the war as a "darkness menacing the earth." During this time, the Vatican had expressed its frustration with the international ignoring of the pope's calls for peace in the Middle East.[118]
Pope Saint John Paul II was the world's first leader to use the term genocide (on 15 May 1990) to call the massacre between Hutus and Tutsis in the mostly Catholic country of Rwanda in the 1990s, which escalated in 1994. Already before the escalation of the killings, John Paul II called for a ceasefire and condemned the massacres twice in 1990 – on 10 April and 15 May.[119] In 1995, during his third visit to Kenya before an audience of 300,000, John Paul II pleaded for an end to the violence in Rwanda and Burundi, pleading for forgiveness and reconciliation as a solution to the genocide. John Paul II told Rwandan and Burundian refugees that he "was close to them and shared their immense pain." His pleas for peace and forgiveness resulted from fears that the ethnic violence could spill over into Kenya and other parts of East Africa. In an emotional call for peace, John Paul II said:
"What is happening in your countries is a terrible tragedy that must end. During the African Synod, we, the pastors of the church, felt the duty to express our consternation and to launch an appeal for forgiveness and reconciliation. This is the only way to dissipate the threats of ethnocentrism that are hovering over Africa these days and that have so brutally touched Rwanda and Burundi."[120]
While taking a traditional position on sexuality, defending the Church's moral opposition to marriage for same-sex couples, Pope Saint John Paul II asserted that people with homosexual inclinations possess the same inherent dignity and rights as everybody else.[121] In his book, Memory and Identity, he referred to the "strong pressures" by the European Parliament to recognise homosexual unions as an alternative type of family, with the right to adopt children. In the book, as quoted by Reuters, he wrote: "It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, more subtle and hidden, perhaps, intent upon exploiting human rights themselves against man and against the family."[59][122] A 1997 study determined that 3% of the pope's statements were about the issue of sexual morality.[123]
Pope John Paul II has been credited with inspiring political change that not only led to the collapse of Communism in his native Poland and eventually all of Eastern Europe, but also in many countries ruled by dictators. In the words of Joaquín Navarro-Valls, John Paul II's press secretary:
The single fact of John Paul II's election in 1978 changed everything. In Poland, everything began. Not in East Germany or Czechoslovakia. Then the whole thing spread. Why in 1980 did they lead the way in Gdansk? Why did they decide, now or never? Only because there was a Polish pope. He was in Chile and Pinochet was out. He was in Haiti and Duvalier was out. He was in the Philippines and Marcos was out. On many of those occasions, people would come here to the Vatican thanking the Holy Father for changing things.[124]
Before John Paul II's pilgrimage to Latin America, during a meeting with reporters, he criticised Augusto Pinochet's regime as "dictatorial." In the words of the New York Times, he was "using unusually strong language" to criticise Pinochet and asserted the journalists that the Church in Chile must not only pray, but actively fight for the restoration of democracy in Chile.[125]
During his visit to Chile in 1987, John Paul II asked Chile's 31 Catholic bishops to campaign for free elections in the country.[126] According to George Weigel and Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz, he encouraged Pinochet to accept a democratic opening of the regime, and may even have called for his resignation[127] According to Monsignor Sławomir Oder, the postulator of John Paul II's beatification cause, John Paul's words to Pinochet had a profound impact on the Chilean dictator. The Pope confided to a friend: "I received a letter from Pinochet in which he told me that as a Catholic he had listened to my words, he had accepted them, and he had decided to begin the process to change the leadership of his country."[128]
During his visit to Chile, John Paul II supported the Vicariate of Solidarity, the Church-led pro-democracy, anti-Pinochet organisation. John Paul II visited the Vicariate of Solidarity's offices, spoke with its workers, and "called upon them to continue their work, emphasizing that the Gospel consistently urges respect for human rights."[129] While in Chile, Pope John Paul II made gestures of public support of Chile's anti-Pinochet democratic opposition. For instance, he hugged and kissed Carmen Gloria Quintana, a young student burned alive by Chilean police and told her that "We must pray for peace and justice in Chile."[130] Later, he met with several opposition groups, including those that had been declared illegal by Pinochet's government. The opposition praised John Paul II for denouncing Pinochet as a "dictator," for many members of Chile's opposition were persecuted for much milder statements. Bishop Carlos Camus, one of the harshest critics of Pinochet's dictatorship within the Chilean Church, praised John Paul II's stance during the papal visit: "I am quite moved, because our pastor supports us totally. Never again will anyone be able to say that we are interfering in politics when we defend human dignity." He added: "No country the Pope has visited has remained the same after his departure. The Pope's visit is a mission, an extraordinary social catechism, and his stay here will be a watershed in Chilean history."[131]
Some have erroneously accused John Paul II of affirming Pinochet's regime by appearing with the Chilean ruler in public. However, Cardinal Roberto Tucci, the organiser of John Paul II's visits, revealed that Pinochet tricked the pontiff by telling him he would take him to his living room, while in reality he took him to his balcony. Tucci claims that the pontiff was "furious."[132]
Pope John Paul II visited Haiti on 9 March 1983, when the country was ruled by Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier. He bluntly criticised the poverty of the country, directly addressing Baby Doc and his wife, Michèle Bennett in front of a large crowd of Haitians:
Yours is a beautiful country, rich in human resources, but Christians cannot be unaware of the injustice, the excessive inequality, the degradation of the quality of life, the misery, the hunger, the fear suffered by the majority of the people.[133]
John Paul II spoke in French and occasionally in Creole, and in the homily outlined the basic human rights that most Haitians lacked: "the opportunity to eat enough, to be cared for when ill, to find housing, to study, to overcome illiteracy, to find worthwhile and properly paid work; all that provides a truly human life for men and women, for young and old." Following John Paul II's pilgrimage, the Haitian opposition to Duvalier frequently reproduced and quoted the Pope's message. Shortly before leaving Haiti, John Paul II called for social change in Haiti by saying: "Lift up your heads, be conscious of your dignity of men created in God's image..."[134]
John Paul II's visit inspired massive protests against the Duvalier dictatorship. In response to the visit, 860 Catholic priests and Church workers signed a statement committing the Church to work on behalf of the poor.[135] In 1986, Duvalier was deposed in an uprising.
The collapse of the dictatorship of General Alfredo Stroessner of Paraguay was linked, among other things, to Pope John Paul II's visit to the South American country in 1989. Since Stroessner's taking power through a coup d'état in 1954, Paraguay's bishops increasingly criticised the regime for human rights abuses, rigged elections, and the country's feudal economy. During his private meeting with Stroessner, John Paul II told the dictator:
"Politics has a fundamental ethical dimension because it is first and foremeost a service to man. The Church can and must remind men — and in particular those who govern — of their ethical duties for the good of the whole of society. The Church cannot be isolated inside its temples just as men's consciences cannot be isolated from God."[136]
Later, during a Mass, Pope John Paul II criticised the regime for impoverishing the peasants and the unemployed, claiming that the government must give people greater access to the land. Although Stroessner tried to prevent him from doing so, Pope John Paul II met opposition leaders in the one-party state.[136]
John Paul II has been credited with being instrumental in bringing down Communism in Central and Eastern Europe,[59][66][70][86][87][137] by being the spiritual inspiration behind its downfall and catalyst for "a peaceful revolution" in Poland. Lech Wałęsa, the founder of 'Solidarity', credited John Paul II with giving Poles the courage to demand change.[59] According to Wałęsa, "Before his pontificate, the world was divided into blocs. Nobody knew how to get rid of Communism. In Warsaw, in 1979, he simply said: 'Do not be afraid', and later prayed: 'Let your Spirit descend and change the image of the land... this land'."[137] It has also been widely alleged that the Vatican Bank covertly funded Solidarity.[138][139]
Then-U.S. President George W. Bush presenting the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Pope Saint John Paul II in June 2004
President Ronald Reagan's correspondence with the pope reveals "a continuous scurrying to shore up Vatican support for U.S. policies. Perhaps most surprisingly, the papers show that, as late as 1984, the pope did not believe the Communist Polish government could be changed."[140]
As the British historian Timothy Garton Ash, who describes himself as an "agnostic liberal," explained shortly after John Paul II's death:
No one can prove conclusively that he was a primary cause of the end of communism. However, the major figures on all sides – not just Lech Wałęsa, the Polish Solidarity leader, but also Solidarity's arch-opponent, General Wojciech Jaruzelski; not just the former American president George Bush Senior but also the former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev – now agree that he was. I would argue the historical case in three steps: without the Polish Pope, no Solidarity revolution in Poland in 1980; without Solidarity, no dramatic change in Soviet policy towards eastern Europe under Gorbachev; without that change, no velvet revolutions in 1989.[141]
In December 1989, John Paul II met with the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the Vatican and each expressed his respect and admiration for the other. Gorbachev once said "The collapse of the Iron Curtain would have been impossible without John Paul II".[66][86] On John Paul II's death, Mikhail Gorbachev said: "Pope John Paul II's devotion to his followers is a remarkable example to all of us."[87][137]
On 4 June 2004, then-U.S. President George W. Bush presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honour, to Pope Saint John Paul II during a ceremony at the Apostolic Palace. The president read the citation that accompanied the medal, which recognised "this son of Poland" whose "principled stand for peace and freedom has inspired millions and helped to topple communism and tyranny."[142] After receiving the award, John Paul II said, "May the desire for freedom, peace, a more humane world symbolised by this medal inspire men and women of goodwill in every time and place."[143]
Poland's Communist government unsuccessfully tried to embarrass John Paul II and undermine his popularity by falsely asserting he had an illegitimate son. Służba Bezpieczeństwa, Poland's Communist-era security service, had an action named "Triangolo" headed by Captain Grzegorz Piotrowski, one of the murderers of Jerzy Popiełuszko. Piotrowski wanted to take advantage of Irena Kinaszewska, the secretary of the Kraków-based Catholic magazine Tygodnik Powszechny, where the future Pope John Paul II once worked, and who was an admirer of John Paul II. After putting drugs in Kinaszewska's drink, Służba Bezpieczeństwa officers unsuccessfully tried to get her to say she had sexual relations with John Paul II. When this did not succeed, the Służba Bezpieczeństwa forged false memoirs of Kinaszewska suggesting a sexual relationship between the two and placed them in the apartment of the priest Andrzej Bardecki, and the memoirs were to be confiscated by the militia during a search. However, the provocation failed, as Piotrowski was proven a fake and Bardecki found the forgery in time and destroyed it.[144]
Pope Saint John Paul II travelled extensively and met with believers from many divergent faiths. At the World Day of Prayer for Peace, held in Assisi on 27 October 1986, more than 120 representatives of different religions and Christian denominations spent a day together with fasting and praying.[145]
Pope Saint John Paul II had good relations with the Church of England, referred to by his predecessor Pope Paul VI, as "our beloved Sister Church".[146] He was the first reigning pope to travel to the United Kingdom, in 1982, where he met Queen Elizabeth II, the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. He preached in Canterbury Cathedral and received the Archbishop of Canterbury with friendship and courtesy. However, John Paul II was disappointed by the Church of England's decision to ordain women and saw it as a step in the opposite direction from unity between the Anglican Communion and the Catholic Church.[146]
In 1980 John Paul II issued a Pastoral Provision allowing married former Episcopal priests to become Catholic priests, and for the acceptance of former Episcopal Church parishes into the Catholic Church. He allowed the creation of the Anglican Use form of the Latin Rite, which incorporates the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. John Paul II helped establish Our Lady of the Atonement Catholic Church, together with Archbishop Patrick Flores of San Antonio, Texas, as a place where Anglicans and Catholics could worship together.[147]
In his book-length interview Crossing the Threshold of Hope with the Italian journalist Vittorio Messori published in 1995, Pope John Paul II praises animism, drawing parallels with Christianity. He says:
…it would be helpful to recall… the animist religions which stress ancestor worship. It seems that those who practice them are particularly close to Christianity, and among them, the Church's missionaries also find it easier to speak a common language. Is there, perhaps, in this veneration of ancestors a kind of preparation for the Christian faith in the Communion of Saints, in which all believers – whether living or dead – form a single community, a single body? […] There is nothing strange, then, that the African and Asian animists would become believers in Christ more easily than followers of the great religions of the Far East.[148]
In 1985, the pope visited the African country of Togo, where 60 per cent of the population espouses animist beliefs. To honour the pope, animist religious leaders met him at a Catholic Marian shrine in the forest, much to the pontiff's delight. John Paul II proceeded to call for the need for religious tolerance, praised animism, and emphasised common elements between animism and Christianity, saying:
Nature, exuberant and splendid in this area of forests and lakes, impregnates spirits and hearts with its mystery and orients them spontaneously toward the mystery of He who is the author of life. It is this religious sentiment that animates you and one can say that animates all of your compatriots.[149]
During the investiture of President Thomas Boni Yayi of Benin as a titled Yoruba chieftain on 20 December 2008, the reigning Ooni of Ile-Ife, Nigeria, Olubuse II, referred to Pope John Paul II as a previous recipient of the same royal honour.[150]
Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, visited Pope Saint John Paul II eight times, more than any other single dignitary. The Pope and the Dalai Lama held many similar views and understood similar plights, both coming from nations damaged by communism and both serving as heads of major religious bodies.[151][152] As Archbishop of Kraków, long before the 14th Dalai Lama was a world-famous figure, Wojtyła held special Masses to pray for the Tibetan people's non-violent struggle for freedom from Maoist China.[153] During his 1995 visit to Sri Lanka, a country where a majority of the population adheres to Theravada Buddhism, Pope John Paul II expressed his admiration for the Buddhist religion:
In particular I express my highest regard for the followers of Buddhism, the majority religion in Sri Lanka, with its ...four great values of ...loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity; with its ten transcendental virtues and the joys of the Sangha expressed so beautifully in the Theragathas. I ardently hope that my visit will serve to strengthen the goodwill between us, and that it will reassure everyone of the Catholic Church's desire for interreligious dialogue and cooperation in building a more just and fraternal world. To everyone I extend the hand of friendship, recalling the splendid words of the Dhammapada: "Better than a thousand useless words is one single word that gives peace..."[154]
In May 1999, John Paul II visited Romania on the invitation from Patriarch Teoctist Arăpaşu of the Romanian Orthodox Church. This was the first time a pope had visited a predominantly Eastern Orthodox country since the Great Schism in 1054.[155] On his arrival, the Patriarch and the President of Romania, Emil Constantinescu, greeted the Pope.[155] The Patriarch stated, "The second millennium of Christian history began with a painful wounding of the unity of the Church; the end of this millennium has seen a real commitment to restoring Christian unity."[155]
On 23–27 June 2001 John Paul II visited Ukraine, another heavily Orthodox nation, at the invitation of the President of Ukraine and bishops of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.[156] The Pope spoke to leaders of the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organisations, pleading for "open, tolerant and honest dialogue".[156] About 200 thousand people attended the liturgies celebrated by the Pope in Kiev, and the liturgy in Lviv gathered nearly one and a half million faithful.[156] John Paul II stated that an end to the Great Schism was one of his fondest wishes.[156] Healing divisions between the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches regarding Latin and Byzantine traditions was clearly of great personal interest. For many years, John Paul II sought to facilitate dialogue and unity stating as early as 1988 in Euntes in mundum that "Europe has two lungs, it will never breathe easily until it uses both of them".
During his 2001 travels, John Paul II became the first pope to visit Greece in 1291 years.[157][158] In Athens, the Pope met with Archbishop Christodoulos, the head of the Greek Orthodox Church.[157] After a private 30-minute meeting, the two spoke publicly. Christodoulos read a list of "13 offences" of the Catholic Church against the Eastern Orthodox Church since the Great Schism,[157] including the pillaging of Constantinople by crusaders in 1204, and bemoaned the lack of apology from the Catholic Church, saying "Until now, there has not been heard a single request for pardon" for the "maniacal crusaders of the 13th century."[157]
The Pope responded by saying "For the occasions past and present, when sons and daughters of the Catholic Church have sinned by action or omission against their Orthodox brothers and sisters, may the Lord grant us forgiveness", to which Christodoulos immediately applauded. John Paul II said that the sacking of Constantinople was a source of "profound regret" for Catholics.[157] Later John Paul II and Christodoulos met on a spot where Saint Paul had once preached to Athenian Christians. They issued a 'common declaration', saying "We shall do everything in our power, so that the Christian roots of Europe and its Christian soul may be preserved. ... We condemn all recourse to violence, proselytism and fanaticism, in the name of religion".[157] The two leaders then said the Lord's Prayer together, breaking an Orthodox taboo against praying with Catholics.[157]
The Pope had said throughout his pontificate that one of his greatest dreams was to visit Russia, but this never occurred. He attempted to solve the problems that had arisen over centuries between the Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches, and in 2004 gave them a 1730 copy of the lost icon of Our Lady of Kazan.
Pope Saint John Paul II made considerable efforts to improve relations between Catholicism and Islam.[159]
On 6 May 2001, Pope Saint John Paul II became the first Catholic pope to enter and pray in a mosque. Respectfully removing his shoes, he entered the Umayyad Mosque, a former Byzantine era Christian church dedicated to John the Baptist (who was believed to be interred there) in Damascus, Syria, and gave a speech including the statement: "For all the times that Muslims and Christians have offended one another, we need to seek forgiveness from the Almighty and to offer each other forgiveness."[79] He kissed the Qur'an in Syria, an act which made him popular among Muslims but which disturbed many Catholics.[160]
In 2004, Pope Saint John Paul II hosted the "Papal Concert of Reconciliation", which brought together leaders of Islam with leaders of the Jewish community and of the Catholic Church at the Vatican for a concert by the Kraków Philharmonic Choir from Poland, the London Philharmonic Choir from the United Kingdom, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra from the United States, and the Ankara State Polyphonic Choir of Turkey.[161][162][163][164] The event was conceived and conducted by Sir Gilbert Levine, KCSG and was broadcast throughout the world.[161][162][163][164]
John Paul II oversaw the publication of the Catechism of the Catholic Church which makes a special provision for Muslims; therein, it is written, "The plan of salvation also includes those who acknowledge the Creator, in 'the first place amongst whom are the Muslims'; these profess to hold the faith of Abraham, and together with us they adore the one, merciful God, mankind's judge on the last day."[165]
Relations between Catholicism and Judaism improved dramatically during the pontificate of John Paul II.[59][81] He spoke frequently about the Church's relationship with the Jewish faith.[59]
In 1979, John Paul II became the first pope to visit the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, where many of his compatriots (mostly Polish Jews) had perished during the Nazi occupation in World War II. In 1998 he issued "We Remember: A Reflection on the Shoah" which outlined his thinking on the Holocaust.[166] He became the first pope known to have made an official papal visit to a synagogue, when he visited the Great Synagogue of Rome on 13 April 1986.[167][168]
On 30 December 1993, Pope Saint John Paul II established formal diplomatic relations between the Holy See and the State of Israel, acknowledging its centrality in Jewish life and faith.[167]
On 7 April 1994, Pope Saint John Paul II hosted the Papal Concert to Commemorate the Holocaust. It was the first-ever Vatican event dedicated to the memory of the six million Jews murdered in World War II. This concert, which was conceived and conducted by American Maestro Gilbert Levine, was attended by the Chief Rabbi of Rome Elio Toaff, the President of Italy Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, and survivors of the Holocaust from around the world. The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, actor Richard Dreyfuss and cellist Lynn Harrell performed on this occasion under Levine's direction.[169][170] On the morning of the concert, the Pope received the attending members of survivor community in a special audience in the Apostolic Palace.
In March 2000, John Paul II visited Yad Vashem, the national Holocaust memorial in Israel, and later made history by touching one of the holiest sites in Judaism, the Western Wall in Jerusalem,[81] placing a letter inside it (in which he prayed for forgiveness for the actions against Jews).[80][81][167] In part of his address he said: "I assure the Jewish people the Catholic Church... is deeply saddened by the hatred, acts of persecution and displays of anti-Semitism directed against the Jews by Christians at any time and in any place", he added that there were "no words strong enough to deplore the terrible tragedy of the Holocaust".[80][81] Israeli cabinet minister Rabbi Michael Melchior, who hosted the Pope's visit, said he was "very moved" by the Pope's gesture.[80][81]
We are deeply saddened by the behaviour of those who in the course of history have caused these children of yours to suffer, and asking your forgiveness we wish to commit ourselves to genuine brotherhood with the people of the Covenant.[171]
In October 2003, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) issued a statement congratulating John Paul II on entering the 25th year of his papacy. In January 2005, John Paul II became the first pope in history known to receive a priestly blessing from a rabbi, when Rabbis Benjamin Blech, Barry Dov Schwartz, and Jack Bemporad visited the Pontiff at Clementine Hall in the Apostolic Palace.[172]
Immediately after John Paul II's death, the ADL issued a statement that Pope Saint John Paul II had revolutionised Catholic-Jewish relations, saying that "more change for the better took place in his 27-year Papacy than in the nearly 2,000 years before."[173] In another statement issued by the Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council, Director Dr Colin Rubenstein said, "The Pope will be remembered for his inspiring spiritual leadership in the cause of freedom and humanity. He achieved far more in terms of transforming relations with both the Jewish people and the State of Israel than any other figure in the history of the Catholic Church".[167]
With Judaism, therefore, we have a relationship which we do not have with any other religion. You are our dearly beloved brothers, and in a certain way, it could be said that you are our elder brothers.[174]
In an interview with the Polish Press Agency, Michael Schudrich, chief rabbi of Poland, said that never in history did anyone do as much for Christian-Jewish dialogue as Pope John Paul II, adding that many Jews had a greater respect for the late pope than for some rabbis. Schudrich praised John Paul II for condemning anti-Semitism as a sin, which no previous pope had done.[175]
Pope John Paul II's beatification was greeted with great enthusiasm among many Jews. On the occasion, the Chief Rabbi of Rome Riccardo Di Segni said in an interview with the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano that "John Paul II was revolutionary because he tore down a thousand-year wall of Catholic distrust of the Jewish world." Meanwhile, Elio Toaff, the former Chief Rabbi of Rome, said that:
"Remembrance of the Pope Karol Wojtyła will remain strong in the collective Jewish memory because of his appeals to fraternity and the spirit of tolerance, which excludes all violence. In the stormy history of relations between Roman popes and Jews in the ghetto in which they were closed for over three centuries in humiliating circumstances, John Paul II is a bright figure in his uniqueness. In relations between our two great religions in the new century that was stained with bloody wars and the plague of racism, the heritage of John Paul II remains one of the few spiritual islands guaranteeing survival and human progress."[175]
From 15 November 1980 to 19 November 1980, John Paul II visited the Federal Republic of Germany[176] on his first trip to a country with a large Lutheran population. In Mainz, he met with leaders of the Lutheran and other Protestant Churches, and with representatives of other Christian denominations.
On 11 December 1983, John Paul II participated in an ecumenical service in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome,[177] the first papal visit ever to a Lutheran church. The visit took place 500 years after the birth of Martin Luther, the German Augustinian monk who initiated the Lutheran reformation.
In his apostolic pilgrimage to Norway, Iceland, Finland, Denmark and Sweden of June 1989,[178] John Paul II became the first pope to visit countries with Lutheran majorities. In addition to celebrating Mass with Catholic believers, he participated in ecumenical services at places that had been Catholic shrines before the 16th-century Lutheran reformation: Nidaros Cathedral in Norway; near St. Olav's Church at Thingvellir in Iceland; Turku Cathedral in Finland; Roskilde Cathedral in Denmark; and Uppsala Cathedral in Sweden.
On 31 October 1999, (the 482nd anniversary of Reformation Day, Martin Luther's posting of the 95 Theses), representatives of the Vatican and the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) signed a Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, as a gesture of unity. The signing was a fruit of a theological dialogue that had been going on between the LWF and the Vatican since 1965.

The Fiat Popemobile which carried John Paul II during the 1981 assassination attempt on his life in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City
As he entered St. Peter's Square to address an audience on 13 May 1981,[179] Pope John Paul II was shot and critically wounded by Mehmet Ali Ağca,[11][70][180] an expert Turkish gunman who was a member of the militant fascist group Grey Wolves.[181] The assassin used a Browning 9 mm semi-automatic pistol,[182] shooting the pope in the abdomen and perforating his colon and small intestine multiple times.[66] John Paul II was rushed into the Vatican complex and then to the Gemelli Hospital. On the way to the hospital, he lost consciousness. Even though the two bullets missed his mesenteric artery and abdominal aorta, he lost nearly three-quarters of his blood. He underwent five hours of surgery to treat his wounds.[183] Surgeons performed a colostomy, temporarily rerouting the upper part of the large intestine to let the damaged lower part heal.[183] When he briefly gained consciousness before being operated on, he instructed the doctors not to remove his Brown Scapular during the operation.[184] The pope stated that Our Lady of Fátima helped keep him alive throughout his ordeal.[70][180][185]

Could I forget that the event in St. Peter's Square took place on the day and at the hour when the first appearance of the Mother of Christ to the poor little peasants has been remembered for over sixty years at Fátima, Portugal? For in everything that happened to me on that very day, I felt that extraordinary motherly protection and care, which turned out to be stronger than the deadly bullet.[186]
Ağca was caught and restrained by a nun and other bystanders until police arrived. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. Two days after Christmas in 1983, John Paul II visited Ağca in prison. John Paul II and Ağca spoke privately for about twenty minutes.[70][180] John Paul II said, "What we talked about will have to remain a secret between him and me. I spoke to him as a brother whom I have pardoned and who has my complete trust.″
On 2 March 2006, the Italian parliament's Mitrokhin Commission, set up by Silvio Berlusconi and headed by Forza Italia senator Paolo Guzzanti, concluded that the Soviet Union was behind the attempt on John Paul II's life,[181][187] in retaliation for the pope's support of Solidarity, the Catholic, pro-democratic Polish workers' movement, a theory which had already been supported by Michael Ledeen and the United States Central Intelligence Agency at the time.[181][187] The Italian report stated that Communist Bulgarian security departments were utilised to prevent the Soviet Union's role from being uncovered.[187] The report stated that Soviet military intelligence (Glavnoje Razvedyvatel'noje Upravlenije), not the KGB, were responsible.[187] Russian Foreign Intelligence Service spokesman Boris Labusov called the accusation "absurd".[187] The Pope declared during a May 2002 visit to Bulgaria that the country's Soviet-bloc-era leadership had nothing to do with the assassination attempt.[181][187] However, his secretary, Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz, alleged in his book A Life with Karol, that the pope was convinced privately that the former Soviet Union was behind the attack.[188] It was later discovered that many of John Paul II's aides had foreign-government attachments;[189] Bulgaria and Russia disputed the Italian commission's conclusions, pointing out that the Pope had publicly denied the Bulgarian connection.[187]
A second assassination attempt took place on 12 May 1982, just a day before the anniversary of the first attempt on his life, in Fátima, Portugal when a man tried to stab John Paul II with a bayonet.[190][191][192] He was stopped by security guards, although Stanisław Dziwisz later claimed that John Paul II had been injured during the attempt but managed to hide a non-life threatening wound.[190][191][192] The assailant, a Traditionalist Catholic Spanish priest named Juan María Fernández y Krohn,[190] was ordained as a priest by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre of the Society of Saint Pius X and was opposed to the changes caused by the Second Vatican Council, claiming that the pope was an agent of Communist Moscow and of the Marxist Eastern Bloc.[193] Fernández y Krohn subsequently left the priesthood and served three years of a six-year sentence.[191][192][193] The ex-priest was treated for mental illness and then expelled from Portugal to become a solicitor in Belgium.[193]
Pope Saint John Paul II was also a target of the Al-Qaeda-funded Bojinka plot during a visit to the Philippines in 1995. The first plan was to kill him in the Philippines during World Youth Day 1995 celebrations. On 15 January 1995, a suicide bomber was planning to dress as a priest, while John Paul II passed in his motorcade on his way to the San Carlos Seminary in Makati City. The would-be-assassin intended to get close and detonate the bomb. The assassination was supposed to divert attention from the next phase of the operation. However, a chemical fire inadvertently started by the cell alerted police to their whereabouts, and all were arrested a week before the Pope's visit, confessing to the plot.[194]
In 2009, John Koehler, a journalist and former army intelligence officer, published Spies in the Vatican: The Soviet Union's Cold War Against the Catholic Church.[195] Mining mostly East German and Polish secret police archives, Koehler says the assassination attempts were "KGB-backed" and gives details.[196] During John Paul II's reign there were many clerics within the Vatican who on nomination, declined to be ordained, and then mysteriously left the church. There is wide speculation that they were, in reality, KGB agents.
John Paul II apologised to almost every group who had suffered at the hands of the Catholic Church through the years.[59][197] Even before he became pope, he was a prominent editor and supporter of initiatives like the Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops from 1965. As pope, he officially made public apologies for over 100 wrongdoings, including:[198][199][200][201]
The legal process on the Italian scientist and philosopher Galileo Galilei, himself a devout Catholic, around 1633 (31 October 1992).[202][203]
Catholics' involvement with the African chiefs who sold their subjects and captives in the African slave trade (9 August 1993).
The Church Hierarchy's role in burnings at the stake and the religious wars that followed the Protestant Reformation (May 1995, in the Czech Republic).
The injustices committed against women, the violation of women's rights and the historical denigration of women (10 July 1995, in a letter to "every woman").
The inactivity and silence of many Catholics during the Holocaust (see the article Religion in Nazi Germany) (16 March 1998).
On 20 November 2001, from a laptop in the Vatican, Pope John Paul II sent his first e-mail apologising for the Catholic sex abuse cases, the Church-backed "Stolen Generations" of Aboriginal children in Australia, and to China for the behaviour of Catholic missionaries in colonial times.[204]

When he became pope in 1978, John Paul II was still an avid sportsman. At the time, the 58-year-old was extremely healthy and active, jogging in the Vatican gardens, weight training, swimming, and hiking in the mountains. He was fond of football. The media contrasted the new Pope's athleticism and trim figure to the poor health of John Paul I and Paul VI, the portliness of John XXIII and the constant claims of ailments of Pius XII. The only modern pope with a fitness regimen had been Pope Pius XI (1922–1939) who was an avid mountaineer.[205][206] An Irish Independent article in the 1980s labelled John Paul II the keep-fit pope.
However, after over twenty-five years as pope, two assassination attempts (one of which resulted in severe physical injury to the Pope), by Mehmet Ali Ağca and a number of cancer scares, John Paul's physical health declined. In 2001, he was diagnosed as suffering from Parkinson's disease.[207] International observers had suspected this for some time, but it was only publicly acknowledged by the Vatican in 2003. Despite difficulty speaking more than a few sentences at a time, trouble hearing, and severe osteoarthrosis, he continued to tour the world although rarely walking in public.
Pope John Paul II was hospitalised with breathing problems caused by a bout of influenza on 1 February 2005.[208] He left hospital on 10 February, but was subsequently hospitalised again with breathing problems two weeks later and underwent a tracheotomy.[209] On 31 March 2005 following a urinary tract infection,[210] he developed septic shock, a form of infection with a high fever and low blood pressure, but was not hospitalised. Instead, he was monitored by a team of consultants at his private residence. This was taken as an indication that the pope and those close to him believed that he was nearing death; it would have been in accordance with his wishes to die in the Vatican.[210] Later that day, Vatican sources announced that John Paul II had been given the Anointing of the Sick by his friend and secretary Stanisław Dziwisz. During the final days of the Pope's life, the lights were kept burning through the night where he lay in the Papal apartment on the top floor of the Apostolic Palace. Tens of thousands of people assembled and held vigil in St. Peter's Square and the surrounding streets for two days. Upon hearing of this, the dying pope was said to have stated: "I have searched for you, and now you have come to me, and I thank you."[211]
On Saturday, 2 April 2005, at approximately 15:30 CEST, John Paul II spoke his final words in Polish, "Pozwólcie mi odejść do domu Ojca" ("Allow me to depart to the house of the Father"), to his aides, and fell into a coma about four hours later.[211][212] The Mass of the vigil of the Second Sunday of Easter commemorating the canonisation of Saint Maria Faustina on 30 April 2000, had just been celebrated at his bedside, presided over by Stanisław Dziwisz and two Polish associates. Present at the bedside was a cardinal from Ukraine who served as a priest with John Paul in Poland, along with Polish nuns of the Congregation of the Sisters Servants of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, who ran the papal household.
On 2 April 2005, Pope Saint John Paul II died in his private apartment at 21:37 CEST (19:37 UTC) of heart failure from profound hypotension and complete circulatory collapse from septic shock, 46 days short of his 85th birthday.[212][213][214] John Paul had no close family by the time he died, and his feelings are reflected in his words written in 2000 at the end of his Last Will and Testament.[215] Stanisław Dziwisz later admitted to not burning the pontiff's personal notes despite the request being part of the will.[216]

The death of the pontiff set in motion rituals and traditions dating back to medieval times. The Rite of Visitation took place from 4 April 2005 to 7 April 2005 at St. Peter's Basilica. The Testament of Pope John Paul II published on 7 April 2005[217] revealed that the pontiff contemplated being buried in his native Poland but left the final decision to The College of Cardinals, which in passing, preferred burial beneath St. Peter's Basilica, honouring the pontiff's request to be placed "in bare earth".
The Mass of Requiem held on 8 April 2005 was said to have set world records both for attendance and number of heads of state present at a funeral.[202][218][219][220] (See: List of Dignitaries). It was the single largest gathering of heads of state in history, surpassing the funerals of Winston Churchill (1965) and Josip Broz Tito (1980). Four kings, five queens, at least 70 presidents and prime ministers, and more than 14 leaders of other religions attended alongside the faithful.[218] It is likely to have been the largest single pilgrimage of Christianity ever with numbers estimated in excess of four million mourners gathering in and around Vatican City.[202][219][220][221] Between 250,000 and 300,000 watched the event from within the Vatican's walls.[220]
The Dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, conducted the ceremony. John Paul II was interred in the grottoes under the basilica, the Tomb of the Popes. He was lowered into a tomb created in the same alcove previously occupied by the remains of Pope John XXIII. The alcove had been empty since Pope John's remains had been moved into the main body of the basilica after his beatification.
Upon the death of John Paul II, a number of clergy at the Vatican and laymen throughout the world[66][202][222] began referring to the late pontiff as "John Paul the Great"—only the fourth pope to be so acclaimed, and the first since the first millennium.[66][222][223][224] Scholars of Canon Law say that there is no official process for declaring a pope "Great"; the title simply establishes itself through popular and continued usage,[202][225][226] as was the case with celebrated secular leaders (for example, Alexander III of Macedon became popularly known as Alexander the Great). The three popes who today commonly are known as "Great" are Leo I, who reigned from 440–461 and persuaded Attila the Hun to withdraw from Rome; Gregory I, 590–604, after whom the Gregorian Chant is named; and Pope Nicholas I, 858–867.[222]
His successor, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, referred to him as "the great Pope John Paul II" in his first address from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica, and Angelo Cardinal Sodano referred to John Paul as "the Great" in his published written homily for the pope's funeral Mass of Repose.[227][228]

Since giving his homily at the funeral of Pope John Paul, Pope Benedict XVI continued to refer to John Paul II as "the Great." At the 20th World Youth Day in Germany 2005, Pope Benedict XVI, speaking in Polish, John Paul's native language, said, "As the Great Pope John Paul II would say: Keep the flame of faith alive in your lives and your people." In May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI visited John Paul's native Poland. During that visit, he repeatedly made references to "the great John Paul" and "my great predecessor".[229] Two newspapers have called him "the Great" or "the Greatest". The Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera called him "the Greatest"[citation needed] and the South African Catholic newspaper, The Southern Cross, has called him "John Paul II the Great".[230] Two Catholic schools have also been named after him using this title; the recently renamed John Paul the Great Catholic University and John Paul the Great Catholic High School.
1.5 million St. Peter's Square attendees witness the beatification of Pope Saint John Paul II on 1 May 2011 in Vatican City
Inspired by calls of "Santo Subito!" ("[Make him a] Saint Immediately!") from the crowds gathered during the funeral Mass which he performed,[233][234][235][236] Benedict XVI began the beatification process for his predecessor, bypassing the normal restriction that five years must pass after a person's death before beginning the beatification process.[234][235][237][238] In an audience with Pope Benedict XVI, Camillo Ruini, Vicar General of the Diocese of Rome who was responsible for promoting the cause for canonisation of any person who died within that diocese, cited "exceptional circumstances" which suggested that the waiting period could be waived.[12][202][239] This decision was announced on 13 May 2005, the Feast of Our Lady of Fátima and the 24th anniversary of the assassination attempt on John Paul II at St. Peter's Square.[240]
In early 2006, it was reported that the Vatican was investigating a possible miracle associated with John Paul II. Sister Marie Simon-Pierre, a French nun and member of the Congregation of Little Sisters of Catholic Maternity Wards, confined to her bed by Parkinson's disease,[235][241] was reported to have experienced a "complete and lasting cure after members of her community prayed for the intercession of Pope John Paul II".[138][202][233][235][242][243] As of May 2008[update], Sister Marie-Simon-Pierre, then 46,[233][235] was working again at a maternity hospital run by her religious institute.[238][241][244][245]
"I was sick and now I am cured", she told reporter Gerry Shaw. "I am cured, but it is up to the church to say whether it was a miracle or not."[241][244]
On 28 May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI celebrated Mass before an estimated 900,000 people in John Paul II's native Poland. During his homily, he encouraged prayers for the early canonisation of John Paul II and stated that he hoped canonisation would happen "in the near future."[241][246]
In January 2007, Stanisław Cardinal Dziwisz of Kraków, his former secretary, announced that the interview phase of the beatification process, in Italy and Poland, was nearing completion.[202][241][247] In February 2007, relics of Pope John Paul II — pieces of white papal cassocks he used to wear — were freely distributed with prayer cards for the cause, a typical pious practice after a saintly Catholic's death.[248][249] On 8 March 2007, the Vicariate of Rome announced that the diocesan phase of John Paul's cause for beatification was at an end. Following a ceremony on 2 April 2007 — the second anniversary of the Pontiff's death — the cause proceeded to the scrutiny of the committee of lay, clerical, and episcopal members of the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints, to conduct a separate investigation.[241][247][234] On the fourth anniversary of Pope John Paul's death, 2 April 2009, Cardinal Dziwisz, told reporters of a presumed miracle that had recently occurred at the former pope's tomb in St. Peter's Basilica.[244][250][251][252] A nine-year-old Polish boy from Gdańsk, who was suffering from kidney cancer and was completely unable to walk, had been visiting the tomb with his parents. On leaving St. Peter's Basilica, the boy told them, "I want to walk", and began walking normally.[250][251][252][253] On 16 November 2009, a panel of reviewers at the Congregation for the Causes of Saints voted unanimously that Pope Saint John Paul II had lived a life of heroic virtue.[254][255] On 19 December 2009, Pope Benedict XVI signed the first of two decrees needed for beatification and proclaimed John Paul II "Venerable", asserting that he had lived a heroic, virtuous life.[254][255] The second vote and the second signed decree certifying the authenticity of the first miracle, the curing of Sister Marie Simon-Pierre, a French nun, from Parkinson's disease. Once the second decree is signed, the positio (the report on the cause, with documentation about his life and writings and with information on the cause) is complete.[255] He can then be beatified.[254][255] Some speculated that he would be beatified sometime during (or soon after) the month of the 32nd anniversary of his 1978 election, in October 2010. As Monsignor Oder noted, this course would have been possible if the second decree were signed in time by Benedict XVI, stating that a posthumous miracle directly attributable to his intercession had occurred, completing the positio.
The Vatican announced on 14 January 2011 that Pope Benedict XVI had confirmed the miracle involving Sister Marie Simon-Pierre and that John Paul II was to be beatified on 1 May, the Feast of Divine Mercy.[256] 1 May is commemorated in former communist countries, such as Poland, and some Western European countries as May Day, and Pope Saint John Paul II was well known for his contributions to communism's relatively peaceful demise.[66][86] In March 2011 the Polish mint issued a gold 1,000 Polish złoty coin (equivalent to US$350), with the Pope's image to commemorate his beatification.[257]
On 29 April 2011, Pope Saint John Paul II's coffin was exhumed from the grotto beneath St. Peter's Basilica ahead of his beatification, as tens of thousands of people arrived in Rome for one of the biggest events since his funeral.[258] John Paul II's remains (in a closed coffin) were placed in front of the Basilica's main altar, where believers could pay their respect before and after the beatification mass in St. Peter's Square on 1 May 2011. On 3 May 2011, Pope Saint John Paul II was reinterred in the marble altar in Pier Paolo Cristofari's Chapel of St. Sebastian, which is where Pope Innocent XI was buried. This more prominent location, next to the Chapel of the Pietà, the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, and statues of Popes Pius XI and Pius XII, was intended to allow more pilgrims to view his memorial.
Marco Fidel Rojas, the mayor of Huila, Colombia, testified that he was "miraculously cured" of Parkinson's disease through the intercession of John Paul II. Mr. Rojas' doctor has certified his cure, and the documentation has been sent to the sainthood cause's Vatican office in a case that may move John Paul's canonisation forward.[259]
To be eligible for canonisation (being declared a saint) by the Catholic Church, two miracles must be attributed to a candidate.
According to an article on the Catholic News Service (CNS) dated 23 April 2013, a Vatican commission of doctors concluded that a healing had no natural (medical) explanation, which is the first requirement for an alleged miracle to be officially documented. [260][261][262] The miracle was deemed to have taken place shortly after the late Pope's beatification on 1 May 2011 by his successor, Pope Benedict XVI; it was reported to be the healing of Costa Rican woman Floribeth Mora of an otherwise terminal brain aneurysm on the date of John Paul's beatification.[263] A Vatican panel of expert theologians examined the evidence, determined that it was directly attributable to the intercession of John Paul II, and recognised it as miraculous.[261][262] The next stage was for Cardinals who compose the membership of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to give their opinion to Pope Francis, who decides whether to sign and promulgate the decree and set a date for canonisation.[261][262][264]
On 4 July 2013, Pope Francis confirmed his approval of John Paul II's canonisation, formally recognising the second miracle attributed to his intercession. He was canonised together with John XXIII.[9][265] The date of the canonisation was on 27 April 2014, Divine Mercy Sunday.[266][267]
On Monday, 27 January 2014, it was reported that a relic of the late pope (a vial containing drops of John Paul II's blood) was stolen from the Church of San Pietro della Ienca in the mountainous Abruzzo region of central Italy, an area where the late Pope had loved to go on skiing vacations. Because there are only three relics containing his blood, few or no other items were disturbed, and it would be difficult to sell, the investigating Italian police believe it was a commissioned theft, and that the blood will be used in some sort of satanic ritual. The theft sparked a major search for the culprits.[268] Two men have confessed to the crime, and an iron reliquary and a stolen cross were recovered from the grounds of a drug treatment facility in L'Aquila, 120 km (75 miles) east of Rome, on 30 January, but the relic itself was still missing from the church, 20 km (13 miles) north of L'Aquila. Specialized scientific police searched the grounds. The blood was recovered shortly after, when it was found in the garbage close to where the container that held the relic was found.
Polish Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz, the incumbent Archbishop of Krakow (where John Paul II had served as Archbishop prior to his papacy) and the former Prefect of the Papal Household and longtime personal secretary of the late Pope, gave the vial to the Church there in recognition of its connections to the Pontiff.[269]
The canonisation mass for Blessed Popes John Paul II and John XXIII, was celebrated by Pope Francis (with Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI), on Sunday, 27 April 2014 (Divine Mercy Sunday) in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican (Pope John Paul had died on vigil of Divine Mercy Sunday in 2005). About 150 Cardinals and 700 bishops concelebrated the Mass, and at least a 500,000 people attended the mass with an estimated 300,000 others watching from video screens placed around Rome.[270]
John Paul II was widely criticised, among other things,[271] for his views against the ordination of women and contraception, his support for the Second Vatican Council and its reform of the Liturgy, his stance on the sanctity of marriage, and his lack of action against sexual child abuse within the church.[11][272]
Some Catholic theologians disagreed with the call for beatification of Pope Saint John Paul II. Eleven dissident theologians, including Jesuit professor José María Castillo and Italian theologian Giovanni Franzoni, raised seven religiously liberal, unorthodox points of contention including the Pope's stance against contraception and the ordination of women as well as the Church scandals that presented "facts which according to their consciences and convictions should be an obstacle to beatification". These objections were not sustained, and his beatification (and eventual recognition as a saint) moved forward.
John Paul II was also criticised for failing to respond quickly enough to the sex abuse crisis. In his response, he stated that "there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young".[273] The Church instituted reforms to prevent future abuse by requiring background checks for Church employees[274] and, because a significant majority of victims were teenage boys, disallowing ordination of men with "deep-seated homosexual tendencies".[275][276] They now require dioceses faced with an allegation to alert the authorities, conduct an investigation and remove the accused from duty.[274][277] In 2008, the Church asserted that the scandal was a very serious problem and estimated that it was "probably caused by 'no more than 1 per cent' " (or 5,000) of the over 500,000 Catholic priests worldwide.[278][279]
In April 2002, John Paul II, despite being frail from Parkinson's disease, summoned all the American cardinals to the Vatican to discuss possible solutions to the issue of sexual abuse in the American Church. He asked them to "diligently investigate accusations." John Paul II suggested that American bishops be more open and transparent in dealing with such scandals and emphasised the role of seminary training to prevent sexual deviance among future priests. In what The New York Times called "unusually direct language," John Paul condemned the arrogance of priests which led to the scandals:
Priests and candidates for the priesthood often live at a level both materially and educationally superior to that of their families and the members of their own age group. It is therefore very easy for them to succumb to the temptation of thinking of themselves as better than others. When this happens, the ideal of priestly service and self-giving dedication can fade, leaving the priest dissatisfied and disheartened.[280]
The pope read a statement intended for the American cardinals, calling the sex abuse "an appalling sin" and said the priesthood had no room for such men.[281]
In 2002, Archbishop Juliusz Paetz, the Catholic Archbishop of Poznań, was accused of molesting seminarians.[282] Pope John Paul II accepted his resignation, and placed sanctions on him, prohibiting Paetz from exercising his ministry as bishop.[283] These restrictions were lifted in 2010 by Pope Benedict XVI.[284][285]
In 2003, John Paul II reiterated that "there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young".[273] and in April 2003, the Pontifical Academy for Life organised a three-day conference, entitled "Abuse of Children and Young People by Catholic Priests and Religious", where eight non-Catholic psychiatric experts were invited to speak to near all Vatican dicasteries' representatives. The panel of experts overwhelmingly opposed implementation of policies of "zero-tolerance" such as was proposed by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. One expert called such policies a "case of overkill" since they do not permit flexibility to allow for differences among individual cases.[286]
In 2004, Pope Saint John Paul II recalled Bernard Francis Law to be Archpriest of the Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major in Rome. Law had previously resigned as archbishop of Boston in 2002 in response to the Catholic Church sex abuse scandal after Church documents were revealed which suggested he had covered up sexual abuse committed by priests in his archdiocese.[287] Law resigned from this position in November 2011.[281]
Pope Saint John Paul II was a firm supporter of the Legion of Christ and its leader Marcial Maciel, who was followed by allegations of sex abuse which the Vatican eventually determined were true, after both had passed away.
John Paul II was criticised for his support of the Opus Dei prelature and the 2002 canonisation of its founder, Josemaría Escrivá, whom he called 'the saint of ordinary life.'[288][289] Other movements and religious organisations of the Church went decidedly under his wing (Legion of Christ, the Neocatechumenal Way, Schoenstatt, the charismatic movement, etc.) and he was accused repeatedly of taking a soft hand with them, especially in the case of Rev. Marcial Maciel, founder of the Legion of Christ.[290]
In 1984, Pope Saint John Paul II appointed Joaquín Navarro-Valls, a member of Opus Dei, as Director of the Vatican Press Office. An Opus Dei spokesman says "the influence of Opus Dei in the Vatican has been exaggerated."[291] Of the nearly 200 cardinals in the Catholic Church, only two are known to be members of Opus Dei.[292]
Pope John Paul was alleged to have links with Banco Ambrosiano, an Italian bank which collapsed in 1982.[138] At the centre of the bank's failure was its chairman, Roberto Calvi, and his membership in the illegal Masonic Lodge Propaganda Due (aka P2). The Vatican Bank was Banco Ambrosiano's main shareholder, and the death of Pope John Paul I in 1978 is rumoured to be linked to the Ambrosiano scandal.[139]
Calvi, often referred to as "God's Banker", was also involved the Vatican Bank, Istituto per le Opere di Religione, in his dealings, and was close to Bishop Paul Marcinkus, the bank's chairman. Ambrosiano also provided funds for political parties in Italy, and for both the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua and its Sandinista opposition. There are also rumours that it provided money for Solidarity in Poland. It has been widely alleged that the Vatican Bank funded Solidarity.[138][139]
Calvi used his complex network of overseas banks and companies to move money out of Italy, to inflate share prices, and to secure massive unsecured loans. In 1978, the Bank of Italy produced a report on Ambrosiano that predicted future disaster.[139] On 5 June 1982, two weeks before the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, Calvi had written a letter of warning to Pope John Paul II, stating that such a forthcoming event would "provoke a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions in which the Church will suffer the gravest damage."[293] On 18 June 1982 Calvi's body was found hanging from scaffolding beneath Blackfriars Bridge in the financial district of London. Calvi's clothing was stuffed with bricks, and contained cash valued at US$14,000, in three different currencies.[294]
Many gay rights activists criticised him[who?] for maintaining the Church's opposition to homosexual behaviour and same-sex marriage. During John Paul II's reign, the Vatican described homosexuality as an "objective disorder" and in his own book, Memory and Identity, John Paul II describes the concept of homosexual families as an "ideology of evil",[122][295] phrases which incensed many of the people so described.[who?]
In addition to all the criticism from those demanding modernisation, traditionalist Catholics sometimes denounced him as well. These issues included demanding a return to the Tridentine Mass[296] and repudiation of the reforms instituted after the Second Vatican Council, such as the use of the vernacular language in the formerly Latin Roman Rite Mass, ecumenism, and the principle of religious liberty. He was also accused by these critics for allowing and appointing liberal bishops in their sees and thus silently promoting Modernism, which was firmly condemned as the "synthesis of all heresies" by his predecessor Pope St. Pius X. In 1988, the controversial traditionalist Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, founder of the Society of St. Pius X (1970), was excommunicated under John Paul II because of the unapproved ordination of four bishops, which was called by the Holy See a "schismatic act".
The World Day of Prayer for Peace,[297] with a meeting in Assisi, Italy, in 1986, in which the Pope prayed only with the Christians,[298] was heavily criticised as giving the impression that syncretism and indifferentism were openly embraced by the Papal Magisterium. When a second 'Day of Prayer for Peace in the World'[299] was held, in 2002, it was condemned as confusing the laity and compromising to false religions. Likewise criticised was his kissing[300] of the Qur'an in Damascus, Syria, on one of his travels on 6 May 2001. His call for religious freedom was not always supported; bishops like Antônio de Castro Mayer promoted religious tolerance, but at the same time rejected the Vatican II principle of religious liberty as being liberalist and already condemned by Pope Pius IX in his 'Syllabus errorum' (1864) and at the First Vatican Council.[301]
John Paul's position against artificial birth control, including the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV,[272] was harshly criticised by doctors and AIDS activists, who said that it led to countless deaths and millions of AIDS orphans.[303] Critics have also claimed that large families are caused by lack of contraception and exacerbate Third World poverty and problems such as street children in South America. The Catholic Agency for Overseas Development published a paper stating, "Any strategy that enables a person to move from a higher-risk towards the lower end of the continuum, [we] believe, is a valid risk reduction strategy."[304]
There was strong criticism of the pope for the controversy surrounding the alleged use of charitable social programmes as a means of converting people in the Third World to Catholicism.[305][306] The Pope created an uproar in the Indian subcontinent when he suggested that a great harvest of faith would be witnessed on the subcontinent in the third Christian millennium.[307]
In 1988, when Pope John Paul II was delivering a speech to the European Parliament, Ian Paisley, the then-leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Moderator of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, shouted "I denounce you as the antichrist!"[308] and held up a red banner reading "Pope John Paul II ANTICHRIST". Archduke Otto of Austria, the last Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary, snatched Paisley's banner and, along with other MEPs, helped eject him from the chamber.[309][310][311][312] The Pope continued with his address after Paisley had been ejected.[309][313][314]
A number of quotes about the apparitions of Međugorje, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, have been attributed to John Paul II.[315] In 1998, when a certain German gathered various statements that were supposedly made by the Pope and Cardinal Ratzinger, and then forwarded them to the Vatican in the form of a memorandum, Ratzinger responded in writing on 22 July 1998: "The only thing I can say regarding statements on Međugorje ascribed to the Holy Father and myself is that they are complete invention."[316]

“Everyone knows John Paul II: his face, his characteristic way of moving and speaking; his immersion in prayer and his spontaneous cheerfulness. Many of his words have become indelibly engraved in our memories, starting with the passionate cry with which he introduced himself to the people at the beginning of his pontificate: ‘Open wide the doors to Christ, and be not afraid of him!’ Or this saying: ‘No one can live a trial life; no one can love experimentally.’ An entire pontificate is condensed in words like these. It is as though he would like to open the doors for Christ everywhere and wishes to open up to people the gate that leads to true life, to true love.” - Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI
The life of a saint is one in which the Gospel is luminous. In this way, the Church has received an inestimable gift in St. John Paul II. Through his life, he has shown the radiation of the fatherhood of God in humanity, or what St. Paul calls the "newness of life in Christ" (Cf. Rom. 6: 4).
“I had not yet made my First Holy Communion when I lost my mother: I was barely nine years old.”— Karol Wojtyła
Karol Józef Wojtyła was born on May 18, 1920, in Wadowice, Poland, the youngest of three children. Although he was born into a loving family, his early life was marked by suffering and loss. His older sister, Olga, died in infancy and, by the time Karol was twelve, his mother Emelia had died of kidney failure and his older brother, Edmund, had died heroically serving those stricken with scarlet fever. Known to his friends as Lolek, and growing under the loving guidance of his father, he was a vibrant youth, athletic, studious and a gifted theatrical performer.
“My father’s words played a very important role because they directed me toward becoming a true worshiper of God.” — Karol Wojtyła“After her death and, later, the death of my older brother, I was left alone with my father, a deeply religious man. Day after day I was able to observe the austere way in which he lived …his example was in a way my first seminary, a kind of domestic seminary.” — Karol Wojtyła
Young Karol attended Kraków’s Jagiellonian University in 1938 where he studied Polish language, literature, theater and poetry. He also performed in local theatrical productions, co-founding the Rhapsodic Theater of Kraków. It was during this time that he met his spiritual mentor, Jan Tyranowski, and was introduced to the Carmelite mysticism of St. John of the Cross. This meeting profoundly changed the course of his life, leading him to the priesthood. However, his studies were interrupted when Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939.
In order to remain in the country, Karol was forced to work in a stone quarry as well as night shifts at the Solvay chemical plant. During this time, Karol suffered the loss of his father, who died of a heart attack on February 18, 1941. In 1944, he miraculously survived being hit by a German truck. Through all this, he recounts the maturing of his vocation and the formation of his priestly identity.
“As a young priest I learned to love human love… If one loves human love, there naturally arises the need to commit oneself completely to the service of ‘fair love,’ because love is fair, it is beautiful.” — Pope John Paul II
Karol joined a clandestine seminary headed by Cardinal Sapieha and was ordained alone on the Feast of All Saints in 1946. He then traveled to Rome to continue his doctoral studies. Upon his return to Poland he was made assistant pastor of a parish in Niegowic, where he began his vital work with young people.
After teaching in the Jagiellonian University for approximately five years and having been appointed to the Chair of Ethics at the Catholic University of Lublin, Fr. Wojtyła was consecrated auxiliary bishop of Kraków on July 4, 1958 - the youngest bishop in the history of Poland. Among the first to hear of his election were the young people who had accompanied him on many camping and hiking trips.
Constantly concerned with the question of man, Bishop Wojtyła encouraged a spiritual and cultural resistance to the Communist occupation of Poland, giving his countrymen hope in the face of grave oppression.
Bishop Wojtyła attended the Second Vatican Council beginning in 1962, where he provided a vital support to the seminal documents of the Council. His insight and gifts were also central in the final formulation of Humanae Vitae, which was promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1968. Soon after, he was elevated to the College of Cardinals.
“Do not be afraid! Open wide the doors for Christ…. Christ knows ‘what is in man.’ He alone knows it.” — Pope John Paul II in his Inaugural Address, St. Peter’s Square, October 22, 1978
Cardinal Wojtyła was elected Pope on October 16, 1978, and took the name John Paul II. He was the 263rd successor to Peter, and was to have one of the longest pontificates in the history of the Church, lasting nearly 27 years. He retained his Episcopal motto, drawn from the profound insight of St. Louis de Montfort, “Totus Tuus – I am completely yours.” It would become increasingly clear to the world that this papacy was an incarnation of that motto and a direct response to Divine Love, which was profoundly expressed in his love for man.
Immediately, John Paul II went out to the entire world with a vigorous missionary spirit. He embarked on 104 apostolic journeys to 129 different countries, “to the uttermost parts of the earth” (Acts 13:47), beginning with the West, Mexico and the United States, for the sake of the Gospel. His love for young people led him to establish World Youth Day, celebrated 19 times during his pontificate, which attracted millions of young people from all over the world. The Pope’s concern for marriage and the family was clearly expressed in the establishment of the World Meetings of Families, his Wednesday catechesis on human love and the founding of the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family.
The Pope’s presence on the world stage began the gradual and peaceful removal of Communism from Eastern Europe, averted war between the nations of Chile and Argentina, and began the restoration of peace and the healing of division between the major world religions.
“In everything that happened to me on that day, I felt (the Mother of God’s) extraordinary motherly protection and care, which turned out to be stronger than the deadly bullet.” — Pope John Paul II
On May 13, 1981, Pope John Paul II was the victim of an attempted assassination in St. Peter’s Square. Shocking the world, he exhibited extraordinary love and forgiveness when he made a personal visit to his attacker, Ali Agca, in Rebibbia Prison in 1983. Following his recovery, Pope John Paul II continued with his missionary activity, meeting with more than 17,600,000 pilgrims during General Audiences and countless millions of faithful during his subsequent pastoral visits throughout the world. He continued to meet with numerous government personalities during 38 official visits and 738 audiences and meetings held with heads of state, including two landmark speeches at the United Nations and 246 audiences with prime ministers.
“The answer to the fear which darkens human existence at the end of the twentieth century is the common effort to build the civilization of love…. With the help of God’s grace, we can build in the next century and the next millennium a civilization worthy of the human person, a true culture of freedom. We can and must do so!”— Pope John Paul II in his address to the United Nations
John Paul II’s doctrinal legacy is one of the richest in the history of the Church. He tirelessly guarded the deposit of faith and the tradition of the Church from errors, promoting authentic theological, moral and spiritual doctrine.
St. John Paul II was also a prolific writer; among his principal documents are many treasures of the Church. His writings included 14 encyclicals, 15 apostolic exhortations, 11 apostolic constitutions and 45 apostolic letters in addition to the catecheses delivered in the general audiences, lectures and homilies given during his many travels.
With his emphasis on the universal call to holiness, he beatified 1,338 people and canonized 482 saints, more than all of the popes in the last 500 years combined.
“The whole of the Christian life is like a great pilgrimage to the house of the Father, whose unconditional love for every human creature, and in particular for the ‘prodigal son’, we discover anew each day…. The Jubilee…should encourage everyone to undertake…a journey of conversion.” — Pope John Paul II
Throughout his pontificate, Pope John Paul II guided and prepared the Church to celebrate the Great Jubilee, a celebration of the mercy of God and the forgiveness of sin, which began with the opening of the Holy Door of St. Peter’s Basilica. Eight million pilgrims came to Rome to pray during the Year 2000, as the Church and the whole of humanity passed into the third millennium since the birth of the Redeemer.
During this time, Pope John Paul II prayed for God’s forgiveness and for the forgiveness of those wounded by the sins of Christians throughout the past two millennia.
John Paul II successfully encouraged dialogue with the Jews and inaugurated a time of healing between Jews, Muslims and representatives of other religions. Several times he extended an invitation for these groups to participate in worldwide meetings to pray for peace.
With the Year of the Redemption, the Marian Year and the Year of the Eucharist, he devoted himself to the spiritual renewal of the Church. He was convinced that the Church would receive courage and refreshment, even in the face of the great trials of humanity experienced in the last century, by drawing near the Heart of Christ in the Eucharist. He stated, “...The gaze of the Church is constantly turned to her Lord, present in the Sacrament of the Altar, in which she discovers the full manifestation of his boundless love” (John Paul II, Ecclesia de Eucharistia, 2003).
The love of Christ, “that love which goes to the end,” proclaimed by St. John Paul II with his entire life, was made increasingly comprehensible to the world as the day of his return to vthe Father’s House” drew near.
“Death itself is anything but an event without hope. It is the door which opens wide on eternity and, for those who live in Christ, an experience of participation in the mystery of his Death and Resurrection.” — Pope John Paul II
Suffering from the debilitating effects of Parkinson’s disease, the aftereffects of the wounds from the attempted assassination, multiple surgeries and the loss of his voice, Pope John Paul II expressed in his last days the mystery of the Crucified Lord.
With hundreds of thousands of young people beneath the window of the papal apartment keeping candlelight vigil during the pope’s final agony, John Paul II whispered in response, “I have looked for you and you have come to me. Thank you.” Pope John Paul II died during the first vespers of Divine Mercy Sunday, April 2, 2005, at 9:37 pm, soon after he had uttered his final audible words, “Let me go to my Father’s house.”
More than three million pilgrims traveled to Rome to pay homage to the pope, some standing in line for over 24 hours to pray in thanksgiving for their beloved Holy Father.
On April 28, 2005, Pope Benedict XVI announced that the normal five-year waiting period before beginning the cause of beatification and canonization would be waived for John Paul II. On May 1, 2011, Pope Benedict XVI beatified Pope John Paul II.
“We can be sure that our beloved Pope is standing today at the window of the Father’s house, that he sees us and blesses us.”— Pope Benedict XVI, at the Funeral Mass for Pope John Paul II, April 8, 2005.

=======================================================
Karol J. Wojtyla, known as John Paul II since his October 1978 election to the papacy, was born in Wadowice, a small city 50 kilometres from Cracow, on May 18, 1920. He was the second of two sons born to Karol Wojtyla and Emilia Kaczorowska. His mother died in 1929. His eldest brother Edmund, a doctor, died in 1932 and his father, a non-commissioned army officer died in 1941.
He made his First Holy Communion at age 9 and was confirmed at 18. Upon graduation from Marcin Wadowita high school in Wadowice, he enrolled in Cracow's Jagiellonian University in 1938 and in a school for drama.
The Nazi occupation forces closed the university in 1939 and young Karol had to work in a quarry (1940-1944) and then in the Solvay chemical factory to earn his living and to avoid being deported to Germany.
In 1942, aware of his call to the priesthood, he began courses in the clandestine seminary of Cracow, run by Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha, archbishop of Cracow. At the same time, Karol Wojtyla was one of the pioneers of the "Rhapsodic Theatre," also clandestine.
After the Second World War, he continued his studies in the major seminary of Cracow, once it had re-opened, and in the faculty of theology of the Jagiellonian University, until his priestly ordination in Cracow on November 1, 1946.
Soon after, Cardinal Sapieha sent him to Rome where he worked under the guidance of the French Dominican, Garrigou-Lagrange. He finished his doctorate in theology in 1948 with a thesis on the topic of faith in the works of St. John of the Cross. At that time, during his vacations, he exercised his pastoral ministry among the Polish immigrants of France, Belgium and Holland.
In 1948 he returned to Poland and was vicar of various parishes in Cracow as well as chaplain for the university students until 1951, when he took up again his studies on philosophy and theology. In 1953 he defended his habilitation thesis on "evaluation of the possibility of founding a Christian ethic on the ethical system of Max Scheler" at the Faculty of Theology of Jagiellonian University (It was the last habilitation before closing the Faculty by comunist goverment).
Later he became professor of moral philosophy and social ethics in the major seminary of Cracow and in the Faculty of philosophy at the Catholic University of Lubin (where he became the Director of the Chair of Ethic, and lectured for 25 years until his election for the Pope in 1978).
On July 4, 1958, he was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Cracow by Pope Pius XII, and was consecrated September 28, 1958, in Wawel Cathedral, Cracow, by Archbishop Baziak.
On January 13, 1964, he was nominated Archbishop of Cracow by Pope Paul VI, who made him a cardinal June 26, 1967.
Besides taking part in Vatican Council II with an important contribution to the elaboration of the Constitution Gaudium et spes, Cardinal Wojtyla participated in all the assemblies of the Synod of Bishops.
Since the start of his Pontificate on October 16, 1978, Pope John Paul II has completed 95 pastoral visits outside of Italy and 142 within Italy . As Bishop of Rome he has visited 301 of the 334 parishes.
His principal documents include 14 encyclicals , 13 apostolic exhortations , 11 apostolic constitutions and 42 apostolic letters. The Pope has also published three books : "Crossing the Threshold of Hope" (October 1994); "Gift and Mystery: On the 50th Anniversary of My Priestly Ordination" (November 1996) and "Roman Tryptych - Meditations", a book of poems (March 2003).
John Paul II has presided at 138 beatification ceremonies ( 1,310 Blesseds proclaimed ) and 48 canonization ceremonies ( 469 Saints ) during his pontificate. He has held 8 consistories in which he created 201 cardinals . He has also convened six plenary meetings of the College of Cardinals.
From 1978 to today the Holy Father has presided at 15 Synods of Bishops : six ordinary (1980, 1983, 1987, 1990, 1994, 2001), one extraordinary (1985) and eight special (1980, 1991, 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998[2] and 1999).
No other Pope has encountered so many individuals like John Paul II: to date, more than 16,700,000 pilgrims have participated in the General Audiences held on Wednesdays (more than 1,000). Such figure is without counting all other special audiences and religious ceremonies held [more than 8 million pilgrims during the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000 alone] and the millions of faithful met during pastoral visits made in Italy and throughout the world. It must also be remembered the numerous government personalities encountered during 38 official visits and in the 690 audiences and meetings held with Heads of State , and even the 226 audiences and meetings with Prime Ministers.

 The Definitive Biography of Pope John Paul IIWitness to Hope is the authoritative biography of one of the singular figures -- some might argue the singular figure -- of our time. With unprecedented cooperation from John Paul II and the people who knew and worked with him throughout his life, George Weigel offers a groundbreaking portrait of the Pope as a man, a thinker, and a leader whose religious convictions defined a new approach to world politics -- and changed the course of history. As even his critics concede, John Paul II occupied a unique place on the world stage and put down intellectual markers that no one could ignore or avoid as humanity entered a new millennium fraught with possibility and danger.The Pope was a man of prodigious energy who played a crucial yet insufficiently explored role in some of the most momentous events of our time, including the collapse of European communism, the quest for peace in the Middle East, and the democratic transformation of Latin America. This updated edition of Witness to Hope explains how this "man from a far country" did all of that, and much more -- and what both his accomplishments and the unfinished business of his pontificate mean for the future of the Church and the world.

Witness To Hope: The Biography of Pope John Paul II by George Weigel is as comprehensive a biography of its subject as can be hoped for while the Pope still lives. Weigel, a journalist who came to the Pope's attention after the publication of his book, The Final Revolution: The Resistance Church and the Collapse of Communism, wrote Witness To Hope with his subject's encouragement and assistance. Weigel had unprecedented access to the Pope's correspondence (with, among others, world leaders including Mikhail Gorbachev). He reports lengthy conversations with many members of the Pope's inner circle, and he occasionally reveals vivid details of the Pope's daily life (for example, at the beginning of each day, the Pope's adviser's hear moans and groaning from John Paul's solitary prayers in his private chapel).  According to Weigel, the Pope told him that other biographies "try to understand me from outside. But I can only be understood from inside." Unfortunately, Weigel's method for understanding the Pope "from inside" depends on psychological conjecture ("It may help to begin by thinking of Karol Wojtyla as a man who grew up very fast") and is weakened by his extreme eagerness to praise his subject ("the man with arguably the most coherent and comprehensive vision of the human possibility in the world ahead"). More troubling, Weigel does not ask some of the really difficult questions about this Pope--regarding his involvement with sects such as Opus Dei, for example, or the relationship between his innovative "theology of the body" and his conservative stance on homosexuality, or even the vicissitudes of prayer life. Witness To Hope is a valuable book because it reports many facts that others have not reported. But for incisive analysis of this Pope's theological and political significance, or for insight into his spiritual life, readers will have to wait until the principals in his life story are free to speak more frankly with some future biographer. --Michael Joseph Gross
       Weigel's massive work aspires to be definitive: it is subtitled "the," not "a," biography of John Paul II. Weigel, a Catholic layman and a fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Institute in Washington, D.C., enjoyed the cooperation of the pope and access to top Vatican officials, so the book is rich in new detail. Determined to explain this papacy from the "inside out," Weigel successfully focuses on John Paul's trademark ideas: Christian humanism, the inner connection between freedom and truth, and culture as the driving force of history. As a guide to the pope's thought, Witness to Hope is invaluable. Yet as biography, it is often defective. Weigel frequently dismisses John Paul's critics rather than debating their ideas. The author's strong pro-Americanism leads him to misrepresent the pope as opposing a "third way" between capitalism and socialism and to treat his criticism of the Gulf War as a rare misjudgment. Though John Paul is a towering 20th-century figure, the assertion that his papacy is the most important since the Counter Reformation seems overblown. The book is well written (if somewhat repetitive, perhaps inevitably so with more than 900 pages) and Weigel's command of the material is impressive, but Witness to Hope reads more like a valedictory hagiography than a sober work of journalism.

  This is by far the best biography of Pope John Paul II.Robert BadgerAgain, I greatly enjoyed this book, though I should also mention that it is heavy reading at around 900 pages, so it took me a while to read it.Matthew P. WhiteheadWhile to some this book might be dauntingly long, it well worth the time and is really not a difficult read.Kayla P.
I did not expect to find Weigel on the Pope so engrossing.  I decided to buy it because I have come to realize just how significant a figure in both Christian and world affairs the Pope has been.  Karol Wojtyla's biography  has inspired me to look beyond the present.  As I read I realized how  deeply I had misunderstood the Pope.  There is little doubt that he is one  of the greatest figures of our time.  Some of my misconceptions of John  Paul were due to my own personal discomfort as an Anglican with various  facets of Roman Catholicism.  However, our own limited perceptions should  not distort our recognition of greatness.Just as I brought my own  preconceptions to the man, so have the media who have been covering him  since that day in 1978 when he was elected.  The press have distorted this  man because they have read him through glasses tinted by their own secular  conditioning.  As a result there is a "good" John Paul who  affirms some of their social agendas, and then there is the "bad"  John Paul, who seems not to understand their progressive preferences.  Weigel makes it clear that they have profoundly misunderstood him because  will not measure him on his own Christian terms.To grasp the  significance of John Paul, we need to come to terms with the complexities  of his personality and his origins in a family beset by tragedy in his  early years.  But that is not enough.  From there we need to explore his  own personal Christian journey, his theological formation, his  philosophical studies, and the tough environment in which he grew to  adulthood and exercised the first 30 years of his ministry.  Furthermore,  this man who cannot be understood unless we see him first and foremost as a  priest, a pastor, and a man of mystical prayer.Read more ›
  For this Presbyterian, George Weigel's book about Pope John Paul II was a revelation not only about a remarkable figure in history, but also about Catholic thought and practice.  Weigel has written far more than a  conventional biography. "Witness to Hope" is also a sweeping  history of John Paul's times and his papacy, a trenchant observer's  comments on politics in the '70s and '80s, and a sharp-minded theologian's  explication of John Paul's voluminous writings.  A couple of critics have  sniped that Weigel's book lacks "incisive criticisms" of John  Paul.  In fact, Weigel does speak critically at many points; he simply does  so with such civility and respect that bloodthirsty adversaries of the Pope  and his church are likely to be disappointed.  Far more valuable is  Weigel's fidelity to a principle that he states at the outset:  that John  Paul's life and papacy can only be understood "from the inside."  Weigel's vantage point is as "inside" as any author is likely to  get; footnote after footnote reveals that information provided by Weigel  comes directly from conversation with John Paul II.  Weigel's own  credentials as a religious thinker and writer, his access to the Pope and  to senior officials of the Holy See, the dramatic life of his subject---  all these make the nearly 900 pages of this immense book richly rewarding  for the serious reader.  Consistently throughout "Witness to  Hope," George Weigel paints  a fervently evangelical and intellectual  Pope who presents Christianity as demanding, but exciting and fulfilling.  One might say the same about George Weigel's book: it makes greater demands  upon the reader than would a more superficial, sentimental biography--- but  it richly rewards the reader with its account of an important life.
  This is a comprehensive biography of Pope John Paul II, based on extensive interviews and a thorough study of writings by the Pope covering more than 50 years. Despite the size of the book, it is very readable. The author  places emphasis on the significance of John Paul's contributions to  philosophy, theology, evangelism, and the Catholic Church over the long  run. Hence the book is more than journalism, a common fault of most  treatments of the life of this Pope. While the author has made a strong  case elsewhere (in the magazine First Things) for Pope John Paul II as the  most important person of the 20th century, this book leaves one with the  clear impression that of all the leaders of the 20th century, John Paul is  the most likely to have the greatest influence on the course of the 21st  century. I cannot think of a better book to read as the new millenium  approaches.
  This is a solid, traditional biography that well chronicles the life and times of John Paul II. The work is rich in detail and, on the whole, sound in its analysis of the significance of John Paul's Pontificate.  The author  does an excellent job, moreover, of describing the theological ideas and  works of Karol Wojtyla pre-1978.  The work has two relatively minor  flaws.  First, there are places where catalogues of information -- e.g.,  the topics of each of Karol Wojtyla's addresses on Vatican radio during the  early 1960s, a list of the subjects of each of series of seminars given by  Fr. Wojtyla during a certain period -- are inartfully inserted into the  text. This leaves one with the impression that the author felt compelled to  include all information discovered even when it did not contribute to the  portrait being painted.  The second is a lack of spiritual depth and  sensitivity.  Decisions and actions that are essentially religious in  nature are analyzed primarily for their worldly consequences and/or  presentation.  The discussions of "Humanae Vitae" and  "Ordinatio Sacerdotalis," for example, are the standard secular  analyses one would read from the likes of a Michael Novak.  This leaves the  reader feeling that the portrait of the man fails to reveal his full  spiritual dimension.  Overall, however, this is an excellent work of  historical biography and Mr. Weigel is to be highly commended.
      great book with super details. more like a textbook of JP II. very interesting and loved reading once I got past polish names.
      Truly an extraordinary man.  One whose life positively touched more living people then anyone other than Christ.
      This book will have universal appeal. It will resonate with teenagers to octogenarians or older and it will capture the interest of readers of varying interests.
      George Weigel succeeded in composing a wonderfully concise and informative biography of Blessed John Paul II in a single volume.
      The story of John Paul II's life is fantastic, and it is told in a clear fashion.  It is quite a long read (I'm not finished) and definitely fluctuates between engaging and dull...
      Great book about great man. It works well so far (I haven't reachec pictures yet) on Kindle. Excellent price on sale.
      As a Catholic, during the 1980's and 1990's, I always enjoyed hearing some of my fellow Catholics decry Pope John Paul II as being too liberal or making too many changes, while...
      I got this book for my 5th grader's saint report because I wanted a JPII authority.  This book is definitely the most comprehensive look at his life.
      This is the biography you want to read if you admire John Paul II and have wondered about the source of his greatness.
      This work is an excellent representation of the life, personality, and faith of Pope John Paul II. The book dives into how Karol Wojtyla became one of the most loved Popes in...

  John Paul II Biography               Remembering Pope John Paul II:           Well Done Good and Faithful Servant, Come Share Your Master's          Joy  Pope John Paul II, leader of more than 1 billion           Catholics and spiritual          catalyst to the world, died April 2 at 9:37 PM in his Vatican apartment.           His fragile health further declined over the last few months, including           two recent hospital stays. On Thursday, March 31, his already weak system           suffered a series of medical setbacks, including heart and circulatory           collapse. He was 84-years-old.            John Paul II's papacy of 26 years is the third longest and perhaps the           most momentous in church history. His many accomplishments are extraordinary.           He redefines the papacy by bringing the papacy to the people. He is           the most-traveled pope in history. He is a master communicator-the first           pope to connect with his flock and spread the God News via personal           visits, bestselling books, TV cameras, and the Internet. His moral and           spiritual stature inspires the world. His lasting message to the world           is one of courage, faith, and prayer in action. Pope John Paul II is           the Good Shepherd who tirelessly seeks to bring the world closer to           God. His life and suffering are filled with courage and faith. He exhibits           these same spiritual qualities in facing death. He is a pastor to the           world, reminding us that our true destiny is eternal life.           Throughout his life, including those years of declining health, Pope           John          Paul II gives witness to the dignity and sanctity of life, including          conception and death, including moments of joy and happiness and moments           of suffering and pain. The compassion that the pope demonstrates to           the world has a boomerang effect. The world expresses that same sense           of compassion as the weakened pope hovered near death. This giant of           a man exudes faith and hope, peace and justice, and warmth and reconciliation.           He opposes tyranny and oppression, he reaches out to the Third World,           he embraces the suffering, and he strives for church unity. He is the           world's spokesperson for protecting every aspect of life from conception           to infirmity. His papacy echoes a profound gospel message: We are called           to serve one another to feed          the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, welcome strangers, cloth the           naked, care for the sick, and visit those in prison.            The pope's exceptionable and charismatic rapport with your people endured           from his days as a young priest until his final days on his deathbed.           Dr. Navarro-Valls, the pope's chief spokesman, told reporters that just           hours before the pope slipped in and out of consciousness he haltingly           whispered, "I have looked for you. Now you have come to me. And           I thank you." Pope John Paul II was truly a Good Shepherd to his           last breath. The world in general-young and old, rich and poor, powerful           and weak, Catholic and non-Catholic-prayerfully join in Final Commendation,           "Lord, grant John Paul II eternal rest and let perpetual light           shine upon him."  Karol           Joseph Wojtyla: Boy to Man Karol Joseph Wojtyla           was born on May 18, 1920, at Wadowice, an industrial           town about 30 miles southwest of Krakow, Poland.           When he was just a small boy, Karol's mother           died, and he became very close to his father.           At age seven, Karol began attending the local           primary school, and at age eleven he went to           the state high school. There he was an outstanding           student and athlete. He enjoyed soccer, swimming,           and canoeing, and later took up skiing and mountain           climbing. He also loved poetry and had considerable           interest and ability in acting.  When           he was eighteen, Karol and his father moved           to Krakow where he entered the university to           study Polish language and literature. When the           Germans occupied Poland in September of 1938,           the university was forced to close, but an underground           network of studies continued.           In the winter of 1940, Karol went to work as           a laborer in a limestone quarry at Zakrowek,           outside of Krakow. The following year, he was           sent to the water-purification department of           the Solway factory in Borek Falecki.  Karol           Wojtyla: Priest to Cardinal  It wasn't until 1942,           after the death of his father, that Karol felt           called to the priesthood. He then began studying           theology in secret. However, after the liberation           of Poland by the Russian forces in January 1945,           he was able to openly attend Jagiellonian University           once again.           Karol Wojtyla graduated with distinction in           theology from the university in August 1946.           The following November 1, he was ordained a           priest by Cardinal Adam Sapieha, the archbishop           of Krakow. Cardinal Sapieha then sent Father           Wojtyla to the Pontifical University in Rome           to study, and he received his doctorate in June           1948. A few years later, after serving as a           parish priest from 1948 to 1951, he again returned           to Jagiellonian University to study philosophy.           In addition, from 1952 to 1958 he also lectured           on social ethics at Krakow seminary, and in           1956 was appointed professor of ethics at Lublin,           becoming acknowledged as one of Poland's foremost           ethical thinkers.          On July 4, 1958, Pope Pius XII named Father           Karol Joseph Wojtyla an auxiliary bishop to           the see of Krakow. Five years later, on December           30, 1963, Pope Paul VI named him archbishop           of Krakow. In that role, he proved himself to           be a politically astute and formidable adversary           of the repressive communist government.           It was at the Second Vatican Council (1962-65)           that Archbishop Wojtyla became a prominent figure           internationally. He was a member of the Preparatory           Commission and attended all four sessions of           the Council. During that time, he was an influential           speaker in the debate on religious freedom,           asserting that the Church must allow           others the liberty of thought, action, and speech           that she claimed for herself. After the Council,           he was instrumental in implementing its decisions,           in Rome as well as Poland.           Subsequently, on June 26, 1967, he was named           a cardinal of the Church. During the 1960s and           1970s he was becoming a familiar figure on the           world stage, repeatedly visiting North America.           He even attended the Eucharistic Congress in           Philadelphia in 1976. Also during this period,           he participated in a struggle with the political           regime in Poland to secure a kind of tolerable           legal status for the Church there.   Karol           Wojtyla: Pope John Paul II  Cardinal Wojtyla then, was         a well-known and widely respected personality         when the cardinals met in October of 1978 to elect         a new pope. Unable to reach a consensus for any         Italian candidate, the cardinals began to consider         other possibilities. Finally, apparently on the         eighth ballot, Karol Joseph Wojtyla was elected         by an overwhelming majority, 103 out of 109 votes.         Three things are particularly noteworthy about         the election of John Paul II:          He was the first non-Italian pope in 456             years.  He was elected as the 262nd pope in Church             history.  He was elected at the relatively young             age of fifty-eight.          As         with Pope John Paul I, there was no coronation,         and the inauguration of his ministry as "universal         pastor of the Church" took place in St. Peter's         Square on October 21, 1978.         The story of Pope John Paul II is a story of great         faith and courage. Serving over one billion Roman         Catholics worldwide, he was the longest serving         pope of the 20th century. Pope John Paul II always         spoke out against materialism and a society where         many people have forgotten God. He gave the world         a vision of what it means to walk in the path         of the living God.         A man of boundless determination, spiritual wisdom,         and moral courage, Pope John Paul II started each         day early in the morning in his private chapel         with private prayer. Then, he would celebrate         Mass. Once he was asked, "Why do you get         up so early?" The pope simply replied, "I         like to watch the sun rise."  Even         as a young priest, John Paul II was always keenly         interested in and very popular with young people.         As Pope, he continued his ministry to young people         through youth rallies that drew large and enthusiastic         crowds everywhere. Throughout the world, young         people somehow felt a special connection to the         Pope. He brought an important message to the youth         of the world. Again and again, Pope John Paul         II encouraged young people:          to affirm life in the face of so many negative             messages,  to give their energy and ideals to the             Church,  to grow in the gifts of service and compassion.                 The large crowds the Pope encountered during his         extensive travels delighted in his spontaneity         and humor. During his visit to Miami, Florida,         he spoke about the "beauty of this land of         the sun." At that moment, a loud clap of         thunder punctuated the dreary sky. The Pope then         added, "the sun must also mean rain."         The Pope also reached people in other ways. His         trips usually allowed for face-to-face greetings,         despite the immense crowds. The Pope frequently         would spend more time greeting the assembled people         before and after his talk than he would spend         giving the talk. The Pope skillfully spoke and         read eight languages. In addition, he frequently         would visit with professors of theology, philosophy,         science, sociology, politics, and culture to exchange         ideas and share lunch.         In frail health during later years, Pope John         Paul II suffered considerable pain during his         papacy. On May 13, 1981, while riding in the jeep         nicknamed "the Popemobile," Pope John         Paul II was shot and seriously wounded by a Turkish         man, Mehmet Ali Agca. His wound required major         surgery and his convalescence lasted until October         of that year. Subsequently, he publicly forgave         his attacker, prompting people all over the world         to newly examine the imperative to forgiveness.         While John Paul II always showed tremendous devotion         to Mary, the Mother of Jesus, his devotion was         even more intense after the 1981 assassination         attempt on his life. The assassination attempt         took place on the feast of Our Lady of Fatima.         Having recovered, he went to Fatima one year later.         There, he placed the assassin's bullet on the         altar at Fatima in thanksgiving for God's protection.         He deeply believed that it was a sign from God         that his life had been spared.         In 1989, Pope John Paul II was instrumental in         bringing about the collapse of world communism         and the end of the Cold War. He had always believed         that truth is what sets people free and that God         is the source of all truth.         Then, during the 1990s, he faced additional physical         challenges:          In 1992 he had a benign tumor removed.  In 1993 he injured his shoulder.  In 1994 he broke his thighbone.                 Throughout the world, Pope John Paul II is considered         one of the towering figures of the 20th century.         In 1994, Time magazine selected Pope John         Paul II as the man of the year.         From the very beginning of his papacy, John Paul         II looked ahead to the year 2000. He told the         world, "Do not be afraid to open wide the         doors for Christ." He was particularly interested         in marking the yearlong celebration of the Church's         Jubilee Year, the 2,000th anniversary of the birth         of Christ. Everything about his papacy proclaimed         that the Church's destiny extends from one millennium         to the next.  John           Paul II: A Pope for a New Millennium There is no doubt that           in 1978 a great man was chosen to lead the Church.           From the beginning of his pontificate and even           through his deteriorating health, Pope John           Paul II looked forward to leading the Church           into a new century and celebrating the Church's           Jubilee Year.           The Pope dramatically accented the early months           of Jubilee Year 2000 by traveling to Egypt and           to the Holy Land, marking his 90th and 91st           international trips. On March 12, 2000, at a           solemn penance service, Pope John Paul II asked           for forgiveness of sins committed by the Church           over the past 2,000 years. These events profile           a remarkable pope who reached out to the world           to seek reconciliation among all people and           all faiths. By the close of the Jubilee Year,           his hopes and expectations for Jubilee 2000           were more than realized. More than 30 million           people came to Rome during the Holy Year, and           his act of closing the Holy Door to St. Peter's           Basilica when Jubilee 2000 ended drew wide applause.           On January 21, 2001, John Paul II appointed           thirty-seven new cardinals in the Church. These           new cardinals came from five continents, with           three of them from the United States. Since           becoming pope in 1978, John Paul has named a           total of 154 cardinals. The College of Cardinals           has never been larger and more representative           of the far-reaching corners of the Church that           now consists of one billion Catholics. There           is no doubt that the Holy Father's legacy will           live on in many ways and is certain to touch           many future generations.           Even though the final years of John Paul II's           papacy were marked with health problems and           physical disabilities, he continued to work           for world peace and justice. In January 2002,           he called 50 religious leaders to a peace pilgrimage           in Assisi. The purpose of the pilgrimage was           to host an ecumenical prayer service to ask           God for the gift of peace. With true vision,           the Pope recognized that terrorism puts the           entire world at risk.           In April 2002, the Pope called the American           cardinals to Rome to deal with the sex abuse           crisis in the U.S. In that summit meeting, Pope           John Paul II deplored scandalous behavior by           some priests and urged the bishops to be more           vigilant in investigating and correcting the           sex abuse crisis. The Pope's leadership was           very apparent and provided a sense of urgency           for strong national standards. He also assured           the world that American Catholics have the spiritual           resources to overcome the clergy abuse crisis.           Perhaps one of the strongest hallmarks of John           Paul II's papacy was his spirit of reconciliation.           At the start of the new millennium he issued           a sweeping apology for the errors of the Catholic           Church--going back to early Church history.           In May 2002, he made a five-day tour of Azerbaijan           and Bulgaria.           While visiting Azerbaijan, which is an overwhelmingly           Muslim country, he pleaded for an end to violence           in the name of God. As was true of all of his           many pastoral trips around the world, he was           an ambassador for peace. Interestingly, he also           insisted that as long as he has breath, he will           proclaim to the world, "Enough of wars."           The Pope then continued his tour to Bulgaria.           There, as was true of his entire papacy, he           was eager to build bridges and to mend relations           with the Eastern Orthodox Church. His ecumenical           overtures were obvious as he prayed for the           full unity of all Christians.  The           Legacy of John Paul II  Pope         John Paul II was the most recognized person in         the world. From the time of his election on October         16, 1978, Pope John Paul II traveled to over 110         countries. His many trips, his extensive writings,         his very presence spoke to the heart of all people.         No previous pope has ever traveled so extensively.         No previous pope has ever received so much TV,         radio, newspaper, and magazine coverage. No previous         pope has written more encyclicals, books, and         letters. In a sense, he was the conscience of         the world.         In fact, many historians believe John Paul II         changed the course of history. His many achievements         include:          He worked for and achieved the collapse             of communism.  He spoke to the moral conscience of the             world.  He pursued dialogue with other world religions             and worked to improve relations between Christians             and Jews.  He kept alive the vision and spirit of             Vatican II.  He repeatedly spoke out against the evils             of materialism and violence.  He inspired people everywhere--young and             old, poor and rich with his example of forgiveness             and faith.                 Pope John Paul II was a man of extraordinary faith         and devotion. His spiritual vision led him to         canonize hundreds of saints, many more than the         combined total of all modern popes. For Pope John         Paul II, the saints were vivid examples of the         many different ways to live a holy life.         Pope John Paul II brightened the world in many         ways. He was a shining example of living faith.         He sought to protect human life. He served the         poor. He radiated mercy, imploring forgiveness         of the Church's past sins. His words and actions         taught us that we cannot live without God. His         extensive writings, including countless encyclicals,         apostolic exhortations and letters, were bold         and ambitious efforts to shore up spiritual values,         to solidify theology, and to promote respect for         every person from conception to death.         Pope John Paul II uniquely captured the imagination         and ideals of young people and adults. In fact,         John Paul II is the only pope within the memory         of the younger population. Year after year, he         ranked high on the list of heroes most admired         by young people. In July 2001, in advance of the         17th annual World Youth Day, the Pope again demonstrated         his special relationship with young people, "It         is the nature of human beings, and especially         youth, to seek the Absolute, the meaning and fullness         of life.... Do not let yourselves be dispirited         by those who are disillusioned with life and have         grown deaf to the deepest and most authentic desires         of the heart. You are right to be disappointed         with hollow entertainment and passing fads, and         with aiming at too little in life. If you have         an ardent desire for the Lord you will steer clear         of the mediocrity and conformity so widespread         in our society."         What is remarkable about this message, as is true         of countless other papal messages, is that it         simultaneously reaches an audience far beyond         young people. It is as if the Pope is face to         face with the entire world and is warmly embracing         young people, adult Catholics, people of other         faiths, and, for that matter, the unchurched.         Such universal appeal is rare among world leaders.         But the Pope, both in his years of vigorous health         and in his years of declining health, also transcended         cultures. Pope John Paul II's facility with eight         languages and his prodigious travel schedule to         all points of the world allowed him to have an         impact on global events.         Every aspect of Pope John Paul II's remarkable         life showed us that faith makes all the difference.         There can be no doubt, the world will miss this         man of great faith and courage. Pope John Paul         II has been a true apostle to the world. He was         instrumental in ending communism. Equally important,         he worked tirelessly to build a better world--a         world based on spiritual values. No other pope         of the modern era has had a greater spiritual         and political impact on a sustained basis.         Thank you, Pope John Paul II for your great vision         and moral leadership. We are a spiritually rejuvenated         people because of your example of forgiveness,         peace, justice and charity.             Kids'               Clubhouse |           KIDS ONLY Club |           Teen Center Faith           First for Families | Catechists           & Teacher RCL           Books and More | Faith           First Home | Email         Us  Please read the legal   restrictions and terms of use applicable to this   site.  Use of this site signifies your agreement to the terms   of use.  Faith First is a trademark of RCL Enterprises, Inc.  ©2005 RCL • Resources for Christian Living®.   All rights reserved.
