James Lipton (born September 19, 1926) is an American writer, composer, actor and dean emeritus of the Actors Studio Drama School at Pace University in New York City. He is the executive producer, writer and host of the Bravo cable television series Inside the Actors Studio, which debuted in 1994.[1]
Lipton was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Betty (née Weinberg), a teacher, and Polish-born journalist Lawrence Lipton.[3] Noted as the author of the popular Beat Generation chronicle, The Holy Barbarians, Lawrence Lipton was a graphic designer, a columnist for the Jewish Daily Forward and a publicity director for a movie theater.[4][5][6]
A 1944 graduate of Central High School in Detroit, Lipton portrayed Dan Reid, the Lone Ranger's nephew, on WXYZ Radio's The Lone Ranger. Moving to New York, he initially studied to be a lawyer, and turned to acting only to finance his education.[7] He wrote for several soap operas, Another World, The Edge of Night, The Guiding Light, The Best of Everything, Return to Peyton Place and Capitol, as well as acting for over ten years on Guiding Light.[7]
In 1951, he appeared in the Broadway play The Autumn Garden by Lillian Hellman. He portrayed a shipping clerk turned gang member in Joseph Strick's 1953 film, The Big Break, a crime drama. He was the librettist and lyricist for the short-lived 1967 Broadway musical Sherry!, based on the Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman play The Man Who Came to Dinner, with music by his childhood friend Laurence Rosenthal. The score and orchestrations were lost for over 30 years, and the original cast was never recorded. In 2003, a studio cast recording (with Nathan Lane, Bernadette Peters, Carol Burnett, Tommy Tune, Mike Myers and others) renewed interest in the show.[citation needed]
His book, An Exaltation of Larks, was first published in 1968, and has been in print and revised several times since then, including a 1993 Penguin books edition.[8] The book is a collection of "terms of venery", both real and created by Lipton himself. The dust jacket biography for the first edition of Exaltation claimed his activities included fencing, swimming, and equestrian pursuits and that he had written two Broadway productions.
In 1983, Lipton published his novel, Mirrors, about dancers' lives. He later wrote and produced it as a made-for-television movie.[7] In television, Lipton has produced some two dozen specials including: twelve Bob Hope Birthday Specials; The Road to China, an NBC entertainment special produced in China; and the first televised presidential inaugural gala (for Jimmy Carter).[7]
In 2004, 2005, and 2013 Lipton appeared in several episodes of Arrested Development as Warden Stefan Gentles. In 2008, he provided the voice for the Director in the Disney animation film Bolt. He played "himself" as Brain Wash interviewer of acting teacher for sweet monster Eva in Paris-Vietnam animated Igor. Lipton has also appeared twice in the same episode of Family Guy in cutaways where he simply says "Improv!" both times.[citation needed]
In the early 1990s, Lipton was inspired by Bernard Pivot and sought to create a three-year educational program for actors that would be a distillation of what he had learned in the 12 years of his own intensive studies.[7] In 1994, he arranged for the Actors Studio – the home base of "method acting" in the USA for over 60 years – to join with New York City's New School University and form the Actors Studio Drama School, a formal degree-granting program at the graduate level.[7] After ending its contract with the New School, the Actors Studio established The Actors Studio Drama School at Pace University in 2006.[citation needed]
Lipton created a project within the Actors Studio Drama School: a non-credit class called Inside the Actors Studio (1994), where successful and accomplished actors, directors and writers would be interviewed and would answer questions from acting students.[7] These sessions are also taped and broadcast on television for the general public to see. The episodes are viewed in 89 million homes throughout 125 countries.[2] Lipton hosts the show and conducts the main interview.[7] During an interview with writer Daniel Simone, when asked if he had anticipated the sudden success, Lipton responded, "Not in my wildest imaginations. It was a joint, arduous effort involving many people. At a point and time not too distant in the past, I had three lives. I was the dean of the Actors Studio, the writer of the series, its host and executive producer. I maintained a preposterous sixteen-hour schedule."[9]
Between 1954 and 1959, Lipton was married to actress Nina Foch. He has been married to Kedakai Turner, a model and real estate broker, since 1970.[4] In the 200th episode of Inside the Actors Studio, Lipton revealed that he is an atheist. He also revealed that during the 1950s, he had been for a time a licensed[clarification needed] procurer of prostitutes in Paris.[10] Lipton has stated in interviews that he is a pilot, certified in Airplane Single Engine Land planes.[11][12]

          James Lipton is an actor, academic, author, choreographer, interviewer, scriptwriter, and is a producer for stage and television projects. He is most known for creating and hosting the noted and popular TV series Inside the Actors Studio (1994), where successful and prominent actors discuss their craft for the benefit of acting students.Lipton's mother, Betty (Weinberg), was a teacher and librarian, and his father, Lawrence Lipton (originally Israel Lipschitz), was a beatnik poet. His parents divorced when he was quite young. As a reaction against his beatnik father's anarchic and chaotic lifestyle, Lipton at first chose to pursue a stable and staid career as a lawyer. He originally took up acting as a sideline to finance his law studies but eventually he shifted the focus of his career to acting.Lipton moved to New York City and undertook twelve years of intensive studies in the performing arts. He studied acting and directing under Stella Adler, widely regarded as the most respected acting teacher in the history of American dramatic arts. Adler's other students at various times have included Marlon Brando, Robert de Niro and Harvey Keitel. Lipton also studied with Harold Clurman and Robert Lewis. He studied movie/TV production and directing at New York University and at The New School. He also studied voice, modern dance, classical ballet, and jazz technique.Lipton performed in the play "The Autumn Garden" on Broadway in 1951. He became active in several TV soap operas, joining the cast of The Guiding Light (1952) where he acted and wrote scripts for several years and later became head writer, all while undertaking his formal acting studies. He was a scriptwriter for The Edge of Night (1956) and he became head writer for Another World (1964), The Best of Everything (1970), Return to Peyton Place (1972) and Capitol (1982).Lipton wrote the book and the lyrics for the Broadway hit "Nowhere to Go But Up" (1962), and he did the same for "Sherry!" which was produced on stage in 1967 and released as an audio CD in 2004. Also for Broadway, he produced "The Mighty Gents" (1978), "Monteith & Rand" (1979) and co-produced the Tony award-winning "Ain't Misbehavin'" (1978). He choreographed "Charlot" for ballet theater, and for Moliere's play "The Doctor In Spite of Himself" he translated from the original French, adapted it as a musical version, wrote the lyrics, directed and choreographed.A lover of words, Lipton has made a study of group terms, sometimes called nouns of multitude (examples: a gaggle of geese, a host of angels, etc.). He has published the definitive work on the subject in a best-selling book titled "An Exaltation of Larks". It has been in print continuously since its first edition in 1968. The latest edition, now expanded, contains over 1,100 such phrases. In the book Lipton himself jumps into the lexical fray by offering many new terms of his own invention, including: a score of bachelors, an unction of undertakers, a shrivel of critics, and a queue of actors. Other writings of his have appeared in Newsweek, The New York Times Magazine and The Paris Review.In 1983 Lipton published his novel "Mirrors" which is about the lives of dancers. He later wrote and produced it as a TV movie. In television, Lipton has produced some two dozen specials including: twelve Bob Hope Birthday Specials; "The Road to China", an NBC entertainment special produced in China; and the first time ever televised presidential inaugural gala, for Jimmy Carter.In the mid-1990s Lipton sought to create a three year educational program for actors that would be a distillation of what he had learned in the twelve years of his own intensive studies. In 1994 he arranged for the Actors Studio -- the home base of "method acting" in the USA for some sixty years now -- to join with New York City's New School University, to form the Actors Studio Drama School, a formal degree-granting program at the graduate level.At the same time, Lipton created a sub-project within the drama school: a non-credit class called Inside the Actors Studio (1994) where successful and accomplished actors, directors and writers would be interviewed and would answer questions from acting students. These sessions were also taped and broadcast on television for the general public to see. Lipton himself hosts the show and conducts the main interview.The TV show Inside the Actors Studio (1994) has become a substantial success. In the more than 12 years that it has been on the air, the craft of acting has been discussed by the show's over 200 guests who have included Paul Newman, Barbra Streisand, Harrison Ford, Tom Cruise, Meryl Streep, Angelina Jolie, 'Robert de Niro', Francis Ford Coppola, Kate Winslet, Steven Spielberg, Spike Lee, Charlize Theron, Robin Williams, Gwyneth Paltrow, Anthony Hopkins, Samuel L. Jackson, Johnny Depp, Morgan Freeman, Al Pacino, Cate Blanchett, Martin Scorsese and Dustin Hoffman. The show is viewed in 80 million homes in the USA on the Bravo cable channel and is seen in 125 countries. It has been nominated for 12 Emmy awards. The Actors Studio Drama School has done very well also. During Lipton's term as dean the school became the largest graduate-level drama school in the United States.Important changes began in 2004 for both the TV show and the drama school. The New School underwent a major reorganization and seriously cut back its support for drama education. The Actors Studio's collaboration with the New School came to an end and a new drama school as well as a new venue for the TV show were both set up at Pace University, also in New York City.Lipton's TV show has made him so famous that he has frequently been parodied on Saturday Night Live (1975) by comic Will Ferrell.Lipton continues to host and produce Inside the Actors Studio (1994). He serves as a vice president of the Actors Studio. He holds the lifelong title of Dean Emeritus of the Actors Studio Drama Program. Lipton is preparing a book about the TV show and his life which will be titled "Inside Inside".
      He was formerly the dean of Actors Studio Drama School of New York's New School University for ten years. He now has the title of Dean Emeritus.
      In each of his interviews for Inside the Actors Studio (1994) he asks the famed "10 questions", which are adopted from the famous French television host Bernard Pivot. - 1. What is your favorite word? - 2. What is your least favorite word? - 3. What turns you on creatively, spiritually or emotionally? - 4. What turns you off? - 5. What is your favorite curse word? - 6. What sound or noise do you love? - 7. What sound or noise do you hate? - 8. What profession other than your own would you like to attempt? - 9. What profession would you not like to do? - 10. If Heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the Pearly Gates?.
      Was the creator and executive producer for President Jimmy Carter's Inaugural Gala, the first presidential inaugural gala to be televised. Also the producer of twelve Bob Hope birthday specials.
      He studied acting for two-and-a-half years with Stella Adler, four years with Howard Clurman and two years with Robert Lewis.
      Does all of the research (the famed blue cards) for the Inside the Actors Studio (1994) interviews himself which usually takes about two weeks. While being dean of the Actors Studio Drama School he did this research after his administrative day job at the school.
      His father Lawrence Lipton was a prominent beat generation writer, the author of "Holy Barbarians". His mother was Betty Weinberg. James is an only child.
      Recently recovered the score to his musical "Sherry!" which he wrote in 1967. It is a musical adaptation of The Man Who Came to Dinner (1942). The score was feared to have been lost in a fire but was instead sent to the wrong storage facility and ended up at the Library of Congress with the other contents of the storage unit. A concert version cast album has been produced and is now available. The featured performers are Bernadette Peters, Nathan Lane, Carol Burnett, Christine Baranski, Tommy Tune and Mike Myers.
      In his book "An Exaltation of Larks" he lists the popular and obscure phrases that describe groups of things (ie, a gaggle of geese, a murder of crows and, of course, an exaltation of larks). The book has been in print continuously since 1968.
      Lipton's Inside the Actors Studio (1994) TV show is incorporated as a non-profit and all of its proceeds go to the Actors Studio and the university where it is based. The show has been a success in both ratings and artistically, having earned twelve Emmy nominations.
      Played Dan Reid, the Lone Ranger's nephew on the radio program in the 1940s out of WXYZ in Detroit.
      His paternal grandparents were Polish Jewish immigrants and his maternal grandparents were Russian Jews.

James Lipton is widely known as the creator, executive-producer, writer and host of Inside the Actors Studio, which is seen in 89 million American homes on Bravo, and around the world in 125 countries. From 1994 to the present, more than 250 actors, directors and writers have joined him in creating what many consider the definitive craft archive of our time.
The television series, which has been recognized with fourteen Emmy nominations in fourteen years, a record for primetime television nominations, is in fact a course in a master's degree program, the renowned Actors Studio Drama School of Pace University (www.Pace.edu/actorsstudiomfa), which was created fifteen years ago by Mr. Lipton as a vice-president of the Actors Studio, in collaboration with his Studio colleagues, and which, with Mr. Lipton as its founding dean, became the largest graduate drama school in America.
Just as each of his distinguished guests brings to Inside the Actors Studio a lifetime of experience to be shared with the school's students, Mr. Lipton brings to the series and the school his experience as actor, director and producer in theater, film and television, choreographer, playwright, lyricist, screenwriter, author of both fiction and non-fiction, and academician.
More than ten years of his life were spent in the classroom as a student of three of the acknowledged masters of the theatrical arts, Stella Adler, Harold Clurman and Robert Lewis. He was trained in modern dance and ballet by Hanya Holm and Alwin Nikolais, and in ballet by Ella Daganova and Benjamin Harkarvy. His voice teachers were Eva Gauthier and Arthur Lessac.
His acting career began on Broadway in "The Autumn Garden" by Lillian Hellman,and extended to a wide variety of roles in film and television.
Bringing all the disciplines in which he was trained to his career as a producer, he has been responsible as writer and executive-producer for some of television's most celebrated specials, among them Jimmy Carter's Inaugural Gala, the first Presidential concert ever televised, and the first television special to originate in the Kennedy Center; 12 Bob Hope Birthday Specials, reaching record-breaking audiences; and The Road to China, the first American entertainment program from the People's Republic, which aired for three hours on NBC.
He was the writer and producer of Mirrors, adapted by him from his novel, which appeared on NBC; and he created the story and teleplay for Copacabana, which was chosen by TV Guide as one of the year's ten best TV films.
On Broadway, Mr. Lipton wrote the book and lyrics of two musicals, Nowhere to Go but Up, and Sherry!, which was based on Kaufman and Hart's The Man Who Came to Dinner. In 2005, he revisited Sherry!, producing a cast album for Angel Records, starring Nathan Lane, Bernadette Peters, Carol Burnett, Tommy Tune and Mike Myers. Also on Broadway, he produced The Mighty Gents, starring Morgan Freeman, and Monteith and Rand, which Dennis Cunningham of WCBS TV called "the comic event of the season."

 A REVEALING BEHIND-THE-SCENES PORTRAIT OF THE AWARD-WINNING TV SHOW INSIDE THE ACTORS STUDIO AND ITS CREATOR AND HOST JAMES LIPTON  Each week Inside the Actors Studio takes the unique insights and intimate revelations of its celebrated guests into 84 million homes on the Bravo network and 125 countries.  Now, with Inside Inside, James Lipton, the 2007 recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Emmy, is handing every one of us a backstage pass.  You will witness in unprecedented close-up the wit, wisdom and candor of a galaxy of stars, from Paul Newman to Barbra Streisand, Al Pacino, Steven Spielberg, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Sean Penn, Clint Eastwood, Johnny Depp, Angelina Jolie, Anthony Hopkins, Ellen Burstyn, Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford, Martin Scorsese, Sharon Stone and many, many more, and marvel at the comic inventions of Billy Crystal, Robin Williams, Mike Myers, Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle  and Will Ferrell as James Lipton on the Inside stage.  With the same candor he demands of his guests, James Lipton reveals a life that began under the tutelage of a poet, his father, and a teacher, his mother; continued in the orbit of three theatrical giants, Stella Adler, Harold Clurman and Robert Lewis; and, as writer and producer, took him to the White House with two presidents, the Great Wall of China with Bob Hope, and a wild flight at the controls of an Alaskan bush plane, on his journey to Inside the Actors Studio.

       When the Actors Studio faced possible extinction in 1994, Lipton (An Exaltation of Larks) engineered a partnership between the Studio and the New School for Social Research to create a degree-granting program. Thus was born the Actors Studio Drama School, with Lipton as both founder and dean. The school's craft seminars, in which Lipton interviewed leading actors and directors, became the basis for Bravo's Inside the Actors Studio, and since 1994, he has been that series' executive producer, writer and host. Looking back over the show's parade of personalities, he intercuts autobiographical flashbacks with quotes from the TV interview transcripts. These brief selections, excerpted from his sessions with Tom Hanks, Anthony Hopkins, Jack Lemmon, Mike Nichols, Sean Penn, Julia Roberts, Steven Spielberg, Meryl Streep and many more, may leave some readers wishing Lipton had published the transcripts in full. Raising the curtain on his own memories, he traces the path of his multifaceted career as radio actor (The Lone Ranger), TV actor (The Guiding Light), Broadway lyricist (Sherry!) and novelist (Mirrors). Along the way, theatrical truths emerge and amusing anecdotes abound since Lipton is a witty and engaging writer. The free-associative transitions from interviews to autobiography occasionally read like two different books shuffled together, but that only makes this exaltation of Lipton doubly enjoyable. The 48 illustrations include Al Hirschfeld's caricature of Lipton. (Oct. 18) Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
       There are great, colorful stories about every side of show business here.  James Lipton lets it all go; his openness about himself, and artists of all stripes, is refreshing. Paul Newman  "James Lipton is the most penetrating and compassionate interviewer I've ever known, but, more importantly, a terrific guy." Anthony Hopkins  Once in a blue moon there is a person who comes along and excites an artist by his genuine interest in craft.  James Lipton ignites the artist's own interest in himself and his craft - and often rekindles it.  On these pages you'll find out how. John Travolta  A wonderful bookLipton knows an awful lot about acting and all of it is in this book.  Interesting, original, valuable. Sidney Lumet  Every page brings forth revelations, experiences and moments that James Lipton has encountered and embraced, that could not possibly have happened in one single life, but most certainly did and continues to.  He has interviewed a virtual Whos Who in theater, film and entertainment over the past decade and sprinkles the book with incisive gems from the mouths of these special people.  Its a wonderful book, a joyful read and I highly recommend it! Martin Landau  "James Lipton brings to us a very considered intelligence and a discerning appreciation of our leading artists in theater and film." Gay Talese, author of The Kingdom and the Power and Honor Thy Father  Jim Lipton writes the way he talks,with fluency and passion.  His own story is as startling and revealing as his interviews are.  We at the Actors Studio treasure him. Oscar-winning actress Lee Grant  I dont know anyone more qualified than Jim Lipton to write a book about actors and their work processes.  I consider this book the most comprehensive look into the lives and thoughts of the gifted people that Jim has interviewed.  Its wonderful. Martin Bregman  James Lipton is our cultural insider for all seasons.  As an actor, director, playwright, author, host, and friendly provocateur, he has seen it all and indeed lived it all! Bruce Lundvall, President and CEO, Blue Note Label Group

  I respectfully disagree with the reviewers above.  In addition to being a fan of Inside the Actors Studio, I'm a fan of James Lipton's.  His love of language was legendary before Inside - this is, after all, the author of An Exhaultation of Larks which celebrates the richness of the English language so well it's been in print for something near 40 years. Yes,Inside Inside is written using words that aren't as commonly encountered today as they once were. I consider it a treat to find them tucked into what I regard as his very readable prose.Mr. Lipton has led a fascinating life and I'm glad he's shared it with readers.  His show doesn't settle for trite interviews featuring anecdotes rather than thoughtful content and I was pleased to find his book didn't either. Perhaps the title should have indicated the breadth of the book rather than focus on the show, but, since he was the creator of the series, knowing his story does put you Inside Inside.  If you want a simple book about actors, you'd do better elsewhere, but if you want a visit with an interesting man who has talked with many of the greats about their passion for their craft, this is a fine choice for you.
This isn't really an inside look at "Inside the Actor's Studio."  It's an inside look at James Lipton, with occasional tales about the show and the actors who've graced its stage.On the tv show "Inside the Actor's Studio," James Lipton comes across as  pompous and pedantic and far too impressed with himself.  This impression is only reinforced by this book, where Lipton manages to quote Charles Dickens, Chaucer, Moby Dick, John Donne, Yeats, Coleridge, Robert DeNiro, Orson Welles, and Irving Berlin and refer to DW Griffith, Renoir, Eisenstein, Scorsese, Spielberg, W. C. Fields, James Bond, Fellini, Marcello Mastrioanni, Will Ferrell and more in just the first five pages. Lipton's linguistic showing off gets tiresome quickly.  It doesn't support him as a story-teller; it just makes Lipton sound like he's trying much too hard to sound clever.Which isn't to say that Lipton is not intelligent.  As he goes through  the history of acting theory and of the Actor's Studio, it's apparent that Lipton is thoughtful and insightful about his world.  He sees common themes among different people, and he knows how to bring them together and display them in the context of the performing arts world.  That ability -- one of the strengths of Inside the Actor's Studio -- is at work here, too.  But this book would have been so much stronger if he'd gotten himself out of the way, even a bit.Indeed, while promising that the book won't be about him as much as "the vibrant troop of other people who have quickened the most exciting adventures of my life," Lipton goes on at far too great a length about himself. As with Inside the Actor's Studio, the high points of this book are the words and stories told by guests on show -- their words, not Lipton's.Read more ›
11 of 11 people found the following review helpfulInside Inside delivers exactly what James Lipton promised on KCRW
  I heard James Lipton interviewed by Elvis Mitchell on KCRW's The Treatment (broadcast March 19, 2008).  Lipton was promoting Inside Inside.  The interview made me want to buy the book.  When I visited Amazon to make the hardcover purchase the reader reviews were rather unkind and I thought, unfair.  The theme of the complaints seemed to be that the book centered too much on Lipton and not enough on the show Inside The Actors Studio or on the stars who'd graced the show.  Well after hearing that interview with Lipton on The Treatment, I came away understanding that Lipton's book was about himself and the different people and events that had influenced him.  People who purchased the book thinking it was about something else perhaps did not bother to listen to Lipton before purchasing the book.  James Lipton is a good story teller and at age 80 he has some good stories to tell. His classical education shows itself in his facility with language and in the themes around which he groups his essays.  There are those who state that Inside Inside is too centered on Lipton as if that is a detriment instead of an asset.  Lipton has had a rich life and he has met quite a few interesting characters outside of the well-knowns he's interviewed on the show.  The manner in which he introduces you to these characters and allows you to get to know them through his memories is quite engaging.  Still, this book may not be engaging for everyone.  Before purchasing Inside Inside, or any book for that matter, I would suggest sampling one chapter of the book.  If you would like an audio sample of Chapter 6 of Inside Inside you may search Y-o-u T-u-b-e for the ISBN-13 number for Inside Inside. The number is 978-052595035.
  This book struggles with every problem mentioned in the "too much of Lipton" review, and then some. Not only is the first 1/3 to 1/2 of the book almost strictly about Lipton, his stories are so buried in flowery, pompous prose that it's hard to understand what he's talking about.The rest of the book, while somewhat entertaining, is perhaps the most poorly edited book I've ever read. There is no flow, and apparently no rhyme or reason as to which guests and Lipton anecdotes are paired up in the various chapters. One passage begins with the interview with Michael Caine, then abruptly shifts to a discussion of how an appearance on the show can help to garner an Oscar nod. This happens constantly throughout the book, and is enough to give you literary whiplash.Much of the book is basically a transcript of snippets of interviews, interspersed with anecdotes designed to make Lipton appear charming, clever, or a powerful member of Hollywood's inner circle.All in all, entertaining enough if you enjoy watching the show, but if you've watched the show, you won't get much new info about the guests. If you want to read endless drivel about Lipton, you've found the book for you!
      I love his show And wanted to share this as a gift. The recipient also loved it and loves the show.
      He is such an interesting man with an impressive background.Miss not getting "Inside Actor's Studio" on TV any longer so was anxious to read more about him.
      As other reviewers have noted, Mr. Lipton spends a bit too much space in his book talking about himself, which is not at all as interesting as any of his guests.
      The quality of the copy wasn't the best, the corners were a little bent.  But for a penny book, it was perfectly acceptable.As a fan of this show, I loved this book.
      This is exactly the book you would think James Lipton would write. It is full of detail and how he came to sit in the interviewer's chair on the Actor's Studio.
      I am a fan of the TV program as James Lipton is an incredible interviewer. His background in the entertainment business and his unbelievable preparation allows the viewer to see...
      I saw the latest show, which blurbed the book, in addition to interviewing Bradley Cooper, Robert DeNiro, etc.
      James Lipton is highly regarded in the field of entertainment. Many view Inside the Actors Studio as merely a show that interviews actors, it's much more than that.
      I used to watch this program all the time. This book discusses many interviews that took place on the show, but also talks about James' personal life. What a fascinating character!
      Received brand new book sealed and perfectly packaged for safe shipping and am thrilled.  Mr. Lipton is someone I respect greatly professionally and am thrilled to have the book...

James Lipton was Born …: … on September 19, 1926, in Detroit.Growing up with James:An artistic child, one can gather, as his talents and interests in all things creative are clearly evident from his illustrious career.  He spent a decade studying theatrical arts under renowned actors Stella Adler, Harold Clurman and Robert Lewis. Lipton has studied modern dance and ballet, as well as voice and singing. Over the course of his career, he has garnered three honorary doctorates, as well as a recipient of the French Republic's Chevalier de l'ordre des Arts et des Lettres.James' First Job & The Early Years:Lipton’s first acting gig was on Broadway in “The Autumn Garden,” a play by Lillian Hellman. That cascaded into a well of roles in film and television, including the part of Dan Reid, the Lone Ranger's nephew, during the early 1940s on the radio version of The Lone Ranger. Most recently, he has had a recurring role as an acting obsessed prison guard on the cult classic and since cancelled Arrested Development.He has had an illustrious career that has included writing gigs in all shapes and forms. He was a writer on several soap operas, including Another World, The Edge of Night and Guiding Light, the latter on which he also acted for a decade. He wrote story and lyrics for two Broadway play (Sherry! and Nowhere to Go But Up) and a handful of books.Lipton’s television directing credits include a bevy of Bob Hope specials, as well as Jimmy Carter’s Inaugural Gala, the first Presidential concert ever televised, and the first television entertainment special originating from the People’s Republic of China, The Road to China.Becoming a Talk Show Host:In 1994, Lipton took his love for his craft, as well as his love for teaching, and created a forum with which to showcase that to the world: Inside the Actors Studio. He has interviewed more than 200 actors, directors and writers since that time – and is still going strong. Most people do not realize that the show is, in fact, part of a master’s degree program at the Actors Studio Drama School at Pace University – a program Lipton created more than a decade ago while vice-president of the Actors StudioWhat Does the Future Hold?:In October (2007), Lipton will see published his half behind-the-scenes, half autobiography “Inside Inside”. In the book, Lipton recounts his life, puts himself in the interviewee’s chair, and discusses the why behind his intense preparation for Inside the Actors Studio – two weeks ahead, 400 blue cards, and more.
Beyond that? Boy – the sky’s the limit. And even that’s a stretch, since Lipton already has his pilots license.And Just for Fun:
Married to Kedakai Turner Lipton, vice president at Corcoran Real Estate Group in New York. Famously, she will not let Lipton get a tattoo.
Is a pilot - and discusses such in interviews with fellow pilots Harrison Ford, John Travolta and Tom Cruise.
Is parodied time and again, most notably by Will Ferrell when he was on Saturday Night Live and Will Sasso during his stint on MadTV.
Has no qualms with making fun of himself, proven by hilarious turns on Arrested Development as an acting obsessed prison guard, and Late Night with Conan O'Brien, playing himself in a slew of skits.

Video, James Lipton, Celebrity Ages, Inside The Actors Studio, James Lipton TV, James Lipton Age, James Lipton Bravo, James Lipton Inside The Actors Studio,
We were just minding our business, staring at our computers on this slow Friday afternoon (barring the major snowstorm hurling our way on the East Coast this weekend) when a startling factoid jumped out at us. James Lipton, veteran host of Bravo's "Inside The Actors Studio" and general all-around imposing grump, is 86 years old. That's right, 86. 
That makes the dean emeritus of the Actors Studio Drama School at Pace University the same age as Hugh Hefner, 14 years older than Dick Cheney and a whopping 20 years older than Donald Trump.
Also, his face happens to look the same in every single photo taken of him. A Google image result yielded this:
What is going on? This certainly isn't scaring the bejeezus out of all of the young Hollywood hopefuls on his show. Can anyone tell us what Lipton's secret to aging is?  Thank you.

A REVEALING BEHIND-THE-SCENES PORTRAIT OF THE AWARD-WINNING TV SHOW INSIDE THE ACTORS STUDIO– AND ITS CREATOR AND HOST JAMES LIPTON  Each week Inside the Actors Studio takes the unique insights and intimate revelations of its celebrated guests into 84 million homes on the Bravo network and 125 countries.  Now, with Inside Inside, James Lipton, the 2007 recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Emmy, is handing every one of us a backstage pass.  You will witness in unprecedented close-up the wit, wisdom and candor of a galaxy of stars, from Paul Newman to Barbra Streisand, Al Pacino, Steven Spielberg, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Sean Penn, Clint Eastwood, Johnny Depp, Angelina Jolie, Anthony Hopkins, Ellen Burstyn, Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford, Martin Scorsese, Sharon Stone and many, many more, and marvel at the comic inventions of Billy Crystal, Robin Williams, Mike Myers, Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle – and Will Ferrell as James Lipton on the Inside stage.  With the same candor he demands of his guests, James Lipton reveals a life that began under the tutelage of a poet, his father, and a teacher, his mother; continued in the orbit of three theatrical giants, Stella Adler, Harold Clurman and Robert Lewis; and, as writer and producer, took him to the White House with two presidents, the Great Wall of China with Bob Hope, and a wild flight at the controls of an Alaskan bush plane, on his journey to Inside the Actors Studio.(less)

This is a struggle of a read.  As a fan of the tv show Inside the Actor's Studio; I was excited to read this.  However, Lipton's pedantic approach to over-telling a point has been a hurdle.  Given that, the story of the origins of the Studio; as well as his personal history has been enlightening and his revealing stories of a wealth of actors, writers and directors is worth the sometimes convoluted trip.As I continue, my previous feelings haven't changed. I find it ironic that he states early on in the narrative that he doesn't want to overuse the "I" word; but this is definitely HIS autobiography as much as it is of the Studio and the legions of people associated with it.  Likely just a case of too specific expectations going into it, on my part.Have finally found what I bought the book for in the first place; that being background stories about the myriad guests that have shared the stage with Lipton. And that given, I would recommend this tome to those who enjoy the process by which the art of film-making and theater come to fruition.Also found the coda of upheaveal (one might say betrayal) that almost domed the Actor's Studio Drama School from existence to be quite interesting.(less)
A surprising and enjoyable book about a man you may think you know something about. James Lipton approached his autobiography with the same attention to detail that he uses when approaching an interview on Inside The Actor's Studio. Readers may know about his love of dance and flying, but they probably don't know about his difficult childhood, his time as a pimp or his many television producing firsts.

A surprising and enjoyable book about a man you may think you know something about. James Lipton approached his autobiography with the same attention to detail that he uses when approaching an interview on Inside The Actor's Studio. Readers may know about his love of dance and flying, but they probably don't know about his difficult childhood, his time as a pimp or his many television producing firsts. This is a great read for people who enjoy the history of television production, the mechanics of acting and knowing when to walk away from a situation out of your control. It's a little difficult to get through at times, Mr. Lipton's love of word and alteration can get a bit overwhelming, but it's an interesting read.People looking for a light read and/or gossip about some of the greatest actors alive, this isn't the book for you. Inside Inside focuses more on the road traveled by the author, friends, and the guests on his show than egos or star power. (less)
I’m slightly surprised to be giving this book four stars, but then, it was a slightly surprising read.  Somehow it hadn’t occurred to me that the James Lipton I know as the host of Inside the Actors’ Studio - pedantic, ponderous, sycophantic, unctuous – might be in fact a highly developed and detailed character performance, carefully designed to get the optimum result from his guests.

I’m slightly surprised to be giving this book four stars, but then, it was a slightly surprising read.  Somehow it hadn’t occurred to me that the James Lipton I know as the host of Inside the Actors’ Studio - pedantic, ponderous, sycophantic, unctuous – might be in fact a highly developed and detailed character performance, carefully designed to get the optimum result from his guests.  As it turns out, behind that persona there is (a) an extremely good sport (pace Will Ferrell) and (b) a brilliant, multidisciplinary intellect driven by a passion for culture as a whole and theatre in particular, who has played almost every role you can think of in the creative process of performance.  (You will not BELIEVE the photos of him as a young leading man starting out in New York…) Lipton’s life beyond the Actors’ Studio has been a rich and in some ways astonishing one, both in experience and accomplishment, of which I’ll just say that equestrian show-jumping is NOT the most unexpected!  Because the book is structured around the people and experiences he feels have most influenced him, it has a pleasantly rambling, picaresque quality, flashing back and forth between different periods of his life, but anchored by regular returns to the stage of the New School and his personal most memorable moments from his interviewing years;  there’s plenty of wisdom on offer (his own and many others') about culture, art, and what he firmly and unabashedly refers to as the “craft” of acting.   As one might expect, his writing style can be a bit formal and 19th century – with appealing self-awareness, he starts right off with a reference to David Copperfield - but it’s always eminently readable and often very funny.   Like all memoirists, he doesn’t entirely avoid the inevitable trap of “hey, let me tell you something else amazing about me,” but the reality is he has had kind of a fascinating life among notable people, and it’s hard to play that down all the time when it’s just how things are. And going back to that Interviewer Lipton Character: whether you love or hate his style, for fifteen years he’s elicited some of the most extraordinary and self-revelatory conversations ever with most of the notable creative artists of our time, a remarkable archive for the cultural record (remember that the hour or so that’s broadcast is only about a third of the interview that’s filmed live), so we have to give that performance a pretty good review – he must be doing something right!(less)
Those familiar with the show "Inside the Actor's Studio" will know the author of this book as the host of that show. The book's title suggests that we will encounter a book filled with the details of Lipton's discussions with the actors/directors/musicians he has interviewed over the years, and perhaps new details of their approach to craft. Several chapters do indeed deal with this subject matter and often the material offers rare insights that can be translated to any creative pursuit. As a po...more
Those familiar with the show "Inside the Actor's Studio" will know the author of this book as the host of that show. The book's title suggests that we will encounter a book filled with the details of Lipton's discussions with the actors/directors/musicians he has interviewed over the years, and perhaps new details of their approach to craft. Several chapters do indeed deal with this subject matter and often the material offers rare insights that can be translated to any creative pursuit. As a poet, I often see parallels in the actor's craft pertaining to creating a backstory for a character. The pursuit is meant to lend specificity to the character, hopefully translating to a greater universality in the way an audience relates to the character. When Lipton sticks to the words of the actors as they discuss the way they craft a role, this book is bright and engaging and can even spark a greater understanding of interpersonal relationships on a larger scale. Sadly, though, much of the book has nothing to do with "Inside the Actor's Studio" and more to do with "Inside the Ego of James Lipton" and that is a massive place populated with every famous brush with greatness he has ever had, every celebrity he has ever shared a room with and every accomplishment worthy of his own self-congratulatory pat on the back. Yes, Mr. Lipton has had a very interesting life and met some very famous people, and all of that could have been truly fascinating had it been an exercise in letting us have an insight into their lives rather than a vanity piece dedicated to each time Lipton was mentioned in a conversation or every clever thing HE ever said to THEM. The need for approval was so desperate at times it became embarrassing. Some autobiographies transcend the details and become about something more, something with which the reader can identify, a story the reader begins to share on a more meaningful level. For all his immersion in the world of people who create connections and tell greater truths for a living, Lipton himself seems to have no understanding of that human element in his own writing. Lipton's life and background contain fascinating characters and some really interesting occurrences. They could have made for a powerful accompaniment to the details of the show and the talk of craft. Instead they became an unwelcome source of tedium as I skimmed in search of the next excerpt relating to craft and creation. Five good chapters in a book containing far more chapters than five. Maybe Lipton should have put the details of his life into the hands of a writer trained under his tutelage. (less)
Some readers thought this was supposed to be a 'tell all' about the Actors Studio and its guests.  They may have been confused by the 'Inside, Inside' title.  Anyone who has seen James Lipton's interviews should know that he isn't a gossip monger but, is actually in search of the creative process and how it is born and develops in his guests and students lives.

Some readers thought this was supposed to be a 'tell all' about the Actors Studio and its guests.  They may have been confused by the 'Inside, Inside' title.  Anyone who has seen James Lipton's interviews should know that he isn't a gossip monger but, is actually in search of the creative process and how it is born and develops in his guests and students lives.  This book is an excellent 'tell all' about his creative development throughout both his life and the guests and students he's encountered during his own self discovery as an artist. Now you may need to use a dictionary to define and explain some of his prose while reading...I did.  I persevered (it took me about a chapter and a half) and discovered what a brilliant writer he is. It's worth the time and effort.I can not explain how or even when it happened but, while I was reading through chapters 6, 7, & 8, I decided to become a writer.  I realized that what was holding me back from giving it my all was the very thing that defines me as a writer.  My greatest weakness needed to be used as my greatest asset; my impatience.  I am curious to see what I can learn throughout my own creative journey and I have James Lipton to thank for it.I wish I understood why...Devlin(less)

James Lipton is the host of the Bravo network's Inside the Actor's Studio, a show in which performers and directors discuss their lives and craft.  Inside Inside is Lipton's account of the events in his life that lead him to found the show and a reflection on some of the program's most memorable moments.The subject matter of the book covers three primary sections.  In the beginning, he discusses his relationship with the Actor's Studio and the founding of its Drama School, of which the show is a part.  He includes here some historical information on acting and explains why the Stanislavski method in which the school is based was so revolutionary.  These discussions were particularly interesting to me as they made sections of the show in which actors discuss these subjects more accessible.From there, Lipton moves back in time to trace the events in his own life that led him to the position of founding the Actor's Studio Drama School.  Lipton has led a remarkably charmed life, and the stories he tells include entertaining musings on the soap operas that supported him and many other Broadway actors, the odd series of events that led up to his writing of the best-selling An Exaltation of Larks, fascinating glimpses of careful cultural negotiations during his production of Bob Hope's Road to China special in the early days after Nixon's visit, and how he came to be married to Miss Scarlet from the Clue board game.  In the final section, Lipton revisits some of the 200 guests who have been interviewed on the show, telling behind-the-scenes stories of their visits and recapping some of the highlights.  As an avid watcher of the show, some of these snippets were already familiar to me, but others came from segments of the four-to-six hour interviews that didn't make it into the 45-minute television program.  This section also includes a particularly fascinating gender analysis of the answers to the Pivot question "What is your favorite curse word?" Whether or not one will enjoy reading this book will depend on two things: their level of interest in the performing arts, and their tolerance for Lipton's particular quirks of self-expression.  There is no question that the man has a lot of interesting stories to tell, but his writing can mirror the overwrought, fawning tendencies for which Will Ferrell has so infamously pilloried him on SNL. Lipton has learned, however, to turn these potential weaknesses into strengths; the sections in which he recounts his own interview by Ferrell-as-Lipton and explains the series of events that led up to him dancing with the Horny Manatee on Conan O'Brien are particularly entertaining.  Whatever else one might say about James Lipton, it's clear he has a sense of humor about himself.  (less)
Lena, I'm just in denial. It's, of course, a hopeless situation. I am delighted whenever I find a book I don't want to read!

As an actor, I found this book invaluable. Anyone who has see "Inside the Actors Studio" is familiar with James Lipton the interviewer, but this book reveals James Lipton the person, and his incredibly exciting life. It does not solely serve as his autobiography, however; through the stories of his life Lipton chronicles the forming of The Actors Studio and along with it the Masters program associated with it. He includes wonderful accounts of working with some of the most prominent acting teachers of all time, and details of their methods. The book also includes exceprts from the many interviews conducted on "Inside the Actors Studio", often the most poignant and inspiring quotes and lessons from acting ledgends such as Paul Newman, Susan Surrandon, Sally Field, Dustin Hoffman, and many more.If you are not a fan of James Lipton the interviewer, or of his voice, this book is not for you. Lipton writes the way he speaks, his literal voice jumps off the page as you read his words. It is not a book to fly through, not an easy weekend read. It is meant to be savored, learned from, enjoyed, and read and re-read slowly. As an actor I have no doubt i'll return to its pages many times to gather inspiration and re-enforcment from the quotes and passages I highlighted in my initial reading.I highly reccomend this book to anyone seriously passionate about theatre, acting, directing or play/screen-writing. It is a passionate account of the love of the art form, not just Lipton's, but the many others who created the institutions documented in this book. (less)
Like many people, I was largely familiar with James Lipton from his hosting duties on Bravo's Inside the Actors Studio series and sporadic appearances on Late Nite with Conan O'Brien.  I've long prided myself on my vocabulary, so Lipton has existed for me on a particularly high pedestal; he's one of those few people who bandy about uncommon words with such ease that it does not feel pretentious or condescending.

Like many people, I was largely familiar with James Lipton from his hosting duties on Bravo's Inside the Actors Studio series and sporadic appearances on Late Nite with Conan O'Brien.  I've long prided myself on my vocabulary, so Lipton has existed for me on a particularly high pedestal; he's one of those few people who bandy about uncommon words with such ease that it does not feel pretentious or condescending.  It's rare enough to find someone who will challenge the anti-intellectual strain of the masses and rarer still to find someone who does it with such ease and familiarity with the English language.  In other words, this is a particularly well told story.Lest you fear that Inside Inside is little more than a wordy exercise in linguistic excess, Lipton's had quite the life to discuss.  There are passages of his time spent living in Paris that are among the most page-turning tales I've read yet--and you should know that last year, I read The Sexual Life of Catherine M.  His experiences within the various fields of acting (as an actor, ballet dancer, producer, writer and director) offer great insight to that world, and he does not hesitate to invoke remarks quoted by A-list stars to complement his thesis.  When you can cite Paul Newman as a reference, you've got some serious credibility when you're talking about acting.Lipton's relationship with his estranged father dominates the book, and this anchors the tome.  Time and again, Lipton explores not only his own circumstances, but includes discussions he has had with other folks about their relationships with their parents.  It should come as no surprise that he dedicates no small amount of time to remembering time spent on stage interviewing Angelina Jolie.  In the hands of so many others, their frank conversation would be passed off as celebrity gossip; in Lipton's capable hands, it becomes a genuinely touching exploration of a very universal theme of the human condition.There is one thing I feel compelled to note here, and that is that when I first set out to read this book earlier in the year, I had great difficulty concentrating long enough to absorb more than a paragraph at a time.  As it happened, I was also having a difficult time absorbing vitamin D; my tested levels were at 5.1 nano-grams per milliliter, far below the 34 recommended minimum.  It's hard to read a work of this caliber under those circumstances, and it took me nearly nine weeks to finish.  I suspect my enthusiasm would have been more forceful had I been able to dedicate myself to reading this in earnest, and I consider it a credit to James Lipton's sensibilities as a writer that his verbose stories sustained my attention at all during those weeks.(less)
My edition of An Exaltation of Larks lacks a group term for "anecdote," and, since this book proves the necessity of having one, I am inventing my own.  James Lipton's life has provided him with a coma of anecdotes. This results in some very interesting stories but also an eye-roll of name dropping.  (Making these up is so much fun!) When the stories are good, they are very very good, but Lipton seems reluctant to leave anyone out.  I'm not sure James Lipton has met any young people that are not hi...more
My edition of An Exaltation of Larks lacks a group term for "anecdote," and, since this book proves the necessity of having one, I am inventing my own.  James Lipton's life has provided him with a coma of anecdotes. This results in some very interesting stories but also an eye-roll of name dropping.  (Making these up is so much fun!) When the stories are good, they are very very good, but Lipton seems reluctant to leave anyone out.  I'm not sure James Lipton has met any young people that are not his godchildren, and while I appreciate how much he adores his wife, I kind of got sick of hearing about her.  She's not pertinent to every story just because she happened to be in the room.Perhaps this is a book to be read in snippets.  Reading this practically all in one go while snowbound was probably not the best idea; I imagine these stories are best heard over a few years of charming dinner parties. I would say the majority of this memoir was interesting, but I didn't care for Lipton's voice in such a large book.  He spends the majority of it praising others (or, in the case of Barry Manilow and Bob Kerrey, bitching about others) but still manages to come off as a bit too self-satisfied.  The chapter in which Lipton becomes a mec in Paris, though, is not to be missed.(less)
I decided I have to review this book in three sections.  I found it a little difficult to get into because the erudite Lipton can be rather pompously pedantic and I could not proceed at my usual lickety-split pace.  But once I slowed down and began to savor the writing and immerse myself in Lipton's own incredibly varied story, and learn about Stanislavsky, "The Method," and the foundation of The Actors' Studio, I was hooked and could not put the book down.

But once I slowed down and began to savor the writing and immerse myself in Lipton's own incredibly varied story, and learn about Stanislavsky, "The Method," and the foundation of The Actors' Studio, I was hooked and could not put the book down.  My journal entries reflect a delight in this rich narrative.It takes about 2/3 of the book before Lipton gets into the stories behind the appearance of many of the guests on Inside the Actors Studio, which is what I thought I really wanted to read.  Surprisingly, I found his reverence for his guests, bordering on the cloying, to be tedious.  There is no doubt that these are people of remarkable talent and skill, there is no doubt that they have generously shared themselves to the current students of the Actors Studio, but they are not royalty and I find that there is an overly reverential attitude which made me able to put the book down for a bit, when before I only took a break with great reluctance.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in theatre or who enjoys wonderful writing (it also helps to have a background in French, Latin, and history).  But the ending of it was definitely not my favorite part.(less)
Favorite James Lipton facts:- He's married to Miss Scarlet.- He was a pimp in France.- He was a nationally competitive equestrian.This is a pretty difficult book to review... The first third of the book is largely about Lipton's pre-Bravo career. I suppose if I knew more about earlier eras of film and the entertainment industry this could have been fascinating.

Favorite James Lipton facts:- He's married to Miss Scarlet.- He was a pimp in France.- He was a nationally competitive equestrian.This is a pretty difficult book to review... The first third of the book is largely about Lipton's pre-Bravo career. I suppose if I knew more about earlier eras of film and the entertainment industry this could have been fascinating. But I find Method acting to be irritating - successful or not, its practitioners are always annoying as hell. The occasional snippet from the show would slip in, or an account of time spent with Bob Hope, or some interesting trivia would catch my interest. I was mostly bored.And then... suddenly the Drama School is created, along with the TV show. The creation of the School and show is actually pretty interesting. What a shockingly unique idea! The rest of the book is largely recounts of various moments from the show. With over 200 episodes, it covers some highlights, many of which weren't aired on TV. Humor, tragedy, and interesting patterns emerge from the talents that appear on stage. I had no idea such a wide array of people had done the show. My one season of viewing (even though I watched a LOT of Bravo that year) barely scratched the surface.Mostly this book made me want to watch the show. Without cable, one of the few networks I miss is Bravo, and this show is one of the biggest reasons. I spent a large chunk of my last year of college parked in front of the TV crocheting and watching Inside the Actors Studio and 2 episodes of the West Wing every day. Sadly, there aren't seasons of the show out on DVD. It's a shame, this would probably be one of very few shows that I would be willing to invest a couple hundred dollars in.Until I got to the second half of the book I was pretty bored and annoyed. Lipton is as pompous as he is often portrayed, though by the end of the book I'm more willing to tolerate it. Before I read this I had little understanding of WHY James Lipton could sit on stage and hound these talents. I now have a better sense of who Lipton is, his range of skills, passions, and successes make it a lot more reasonable and his cockiness more well-deserved. By the end, I'm left really liking Lipton, and really missing the show. Highly recommended to any fan of Inside the Actors Studio, though I'm not sure there's much of a point if you haven't seen the show. The book is a good repository of industry talk (not just gossip), but I suspect most people who are interested in these discussions of craft are probably already fans of the show anyway.(less)
So if you watch Inside the Actor's Studio on Bravo, you know Mr. Lipton comes off as a super formal, uptight, dare I say...know it all?  I did.  I said it.  Not that I don't like him.  There's just an air about him, right?  Turns out he is maybe the most fascinating individual you may ever meet.  No kidding.  He has been, done, seen, written things that are beyond the scope of one person.  Found this book truly interesting and couldn't put it down.  
If you have an interest in the performing arts, it's hard to hate this book.  James Lipton has actively pursued many areas of the arts and this book pays homage to all those memories before the landslide of INSIDE THE ACTOR'S STUDIO stories are told.  On the other hand, if you can't get into his humble/stuffy voice, it might not be for you.  This was a bedside book for me for the last year, and I'm really glad it was.  I can't imagine having to read this in a hurry--skimming over it would lose all t...more

I can't imagine having to read this in a hurry--skimming over it would lose all the minute details that he packs into his tales.  There were many nights when I felt I would NEVER be done with it, but now that it's over, I've enjoyed the experience.  I've learned about different methods of acting, I have new perspectives of colorful celebrities, and I definitely believe that James Lipton has made a sincere effort to share an insider's vantage point with his readers.

Lipton's prose style is about as freewheeling as a loaded train in a swamp bog- just about the last way you want to read about method acting, ballet, writing plays, and producing Bob Hope television specials-- all items of already dubious interest in the first place.While a less kind reviewer would recommend using this book as a doorstop, I think it would actually prove to be much more useful as a vocabulary building textbook. The man uses a lot of weird words!(less)
Who was James Lipton before he became known to millions as the incredibly pompous questioner on Inside the Actors' Studio?

The story about Barbara Walters secret sin alone makes this book worth reading.  Not to mention What Barry Manilow Stole.  And the Dirty Joke Ronald Reagan Told.  I could go on and on....  (less)
Not an easy book to get into, but well worth sticking with. The organization is hard to follow at first, definitely not linear in any way. Of course, the excerpts from Inside the Actors Studio, which are found mainly in the latter half of the book, are fascinating and revealing of the actor's craft, and I recall many of them from being a longtime fan of the show.

But the story of Lipton's life is incredible in itself. Here is someone who has followed his own path, lived life to the fullest and is still living it at an advanced age. Be warned though, at the end of the book is the story of the dispute between the Actors Studio and the New School that led the the Studio to Pace University. It's necessary to explain why Inside isn't broadcast from the New School anymore, but the account is a little tedious.(less)

Lipton is so endearingly prolix that you can't help but be lulled by the rhythm of his words!   Inside Inside  makes me appreciate actors, writers, and directors so much more.  Lipton observes how in no other occupation does a person set him/herself up for rejection countless times every year as in the performing arts.  How poignant!  How true!

It's a lovely read for anyone who has ever dabbled in these arts and for anyone who simply marvels at the skills required of the actor, writer, and director.(less)
Oh James Lipton, you genius. Here you had me thinking that you were just a dean of the school who asked actors questions from your stack of blue cards. But forgive me, I was wrong.

I was slightly disappointing when the book started with his childhood, but my mood turned around when I realized what a fascinating life he has had. It's a great read and I am so glad I took the time to read it. (less)
Not quite the book I was expecting, but interesting none the less. More of an autobiography (at least the first half) and less about the program itself. Also, background of the New School and how the Actors' Studio came about and what it was and the "method". It is organized by subject matter rather than chronological so I got mixed up a bit about what was happening when. If you are more familiar than I am about theater and James Lipton's personal history, it probably makes more sense. If you de...more

You know how when you read a biography and you think to yourself, wow, this person really overcame something difficult, or accomplished a lot, and i'm impressed?  Well, this book is nothing like that.  James Lipton is so impressed with himself there's no room for your admiration.

This is an interesting book and a fast read. It is amazing what Mr. Lipton has done in his life and who he knows. Almost the entire arts world is HIS world. The language leaves lots to be desired. He quotes many actors who he defines as 'potty mouths' and he's not kidding about that! He himself doesn't have the cleanest language (not in the writing; when he's quoting himself) which really surprises me.

I really really enjoyed this book. For fans of ItAS, they might not have enjoyed the celebrity interview tidbits as much as I did, because I haven't seen a lot of the interviews he talked about. It's also really nice to see his personal take on things, and what happened in the green room.Unlike the other reviewers, I really enjoyed the personal stuff.

James Lipton seems like a guy I'd like to have a conversation with. Though some of the words he used in this book made my eyes cross. Semihemidemisomething. I remember the three prefixes, and just stared at the word. A really enjoyable, kinda pretentious at points read. (less)
A wonderful memoir by James Lipton, host of Inside the Actor's Studio on Bravo.  Lipton's life has been truly blessed - and he realizes it.  He left his native Detroit to become a lawyer.  Obviously, he never got there, but the detours he has taken along the way have made the man and the show what they are.  What you see IS what you get.  James Lipton reads the way James Lipton appears on screen.  If you like seeing him, you will enjoy reading him.  He is an intelligent, multi-faceted, altruistic human...more

If you are expecting a tell all book about celebrities interviewed by James Lipton on Bravo's Actor's Studio...don't read this book.  This is more of an  autobiography of James Lipton's life. And how and why the school was started and how the show developed from there.  He is pompous, verbose and jumps around some- I ended up keeping a dictionary at hand.  But he is a fascinating person who has lived an incredible life. He has a wonderful loving relationship with his wife, has a fabulous sense of hu...more

I expected a book about Inside the Actors Studio. I wanted to learn more about the people who'd been on it and how the questionnaire came into being and so on. I did learn about that. This could have been a slim 100-pager that I enjoyed instead of the tome-which-wouldn't-end that it was. I also learned about Method acting (far more, actually, than I'd ever hoped to know), about Mr. Lipton's beginnings, middles, endings and all the famous people he knows. I just didn't care that much about James...more

Who knew there was so much more to the gentlemanly interviewer of Inside the Actors Studio? A first class account of James Lipton's life, well written, alternately serious and crack-you-up amusing. We learn that TV airs only about 20% of the stars' visits to the school, and Lipton knows the rest. A fascinating account by a man who himself has an astonishing array of talents.I timed this read well. Bravo is having an Inside marathon the day after Christmas.

Although I haven't watched _Inside the Actors Studio_ regularly for a long while, I really love what happens on the show.This book is part memoir and part a history of The Actors Studio Drama School and of the show.  It's a bit uneven.  Sometimes it was a little slow going, sometimes I was absolutely riveted.  Lipton does come off as pretty egocentric sometimes, but it's forgivable considering that the man has had an amazingly varied career and has hobnobbed with some of the great talents and intel...more

I only know of James Lipton from his cable program "Inside the Actor's Guild."  Lipton's biography gives him credibility to interview the different entertainers that he has on his show.  His experience in the world of entertainment (and I mean a variety of entertainment genres) is fascinating.  A great book if you enjoy getting insights on how people have become successful in the entertainment industry.  He also includes insights he gained through his interviews with premier entertainers of our time...more

Don't get me wrong - James Lipton can come across as a pompous jackass, and I sometimes wonder if he uses certain words just to prove that he can.  But in the end, he has a fascinating life history and put together a read that I found myself really enjoying and looking for spaces in my day where I could read more (always the sign of an interesting one). As a fan of the show, I liked the history of the show and the school as well as the actor anecdotes sprinkled throughout.
