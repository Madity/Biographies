=======================================================
Kate Elizabeth Winslet, CBE (born 5 October 1975),[1] is an English actress and singer. She was the youngest person to acquire six Academy Award nominations, and won the Academy Award for Best Actress for The Reader (2008). She has won awards from the Screen Actors Guild, British Academy of Film and Television Arts, and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association among others, and has been nominated twice for an Emmy Award for television acting, winning once for her performance in the 2011 miniseries Mildred Pierce, in which she played the title role. In 2012 she received the Honorary César Award. She is one of the few actresses to have won three of the four major American entertainment awards (EGOT), with her Oscar, Emmy and Grammy wins.[2][3]
Brought up in Berkshire, Winslet studied drama from childhood, and began her career in British television in 1991. She made her film debut in Heavenly Creatures (1994), for which she received her first notable critical praise. She achieved recognition for her subsequent work in a supporting role in Sense and Sensibility (1995) and for her leading role in Titanic (1997), the highest-grossing film in the world at the time.[4]
Since 2000, Winslet's performances have continued to draw positive comments from film critics, and she has been nominated for various awards for her work in such films as Quills (2000), Iris (2001), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), Finding Neverland (2004), Little Children (2006), The Reader (2008) and Revolutionary Road (2008). Her performance in the last of these prompted New York magazine critic David Edelstein to describe her as "the best English-speaking film actress of her generation".[5] The romantic comedy The Holiday, the animated film Flushed Away (both 2006) and the science fiction film Divergent (2014) are among the biggest commercial successes of her career.
Winslet was awarded a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children in 2000. She has been included as a vocalist on some soundtracks of works she has performed in, and the single "What If" from the soundtrack for Christmas Carol: The Movie (2001) was a hit single in several European countries. Winslet has a mezzo-soprano singing voice.[6]
Born in Reading, Berkshire, Kate Elizabeth Winslet[1] is the second of four children of Sally Anne (née Bridges), a barmaid, and Roger John Winslet, a swimming pool contractor.[7]
Winslet began studying drama at the age of 11 at the Redroofs Theatre School,[8] a co-educational independent school in Maidenhead, Berkshire, where she was head girl.[9] At the age of 12, Winslet appeared in a television advertisement directed by filmmaker Tim Pope for Sugar Puffs cereal. Pope said her naturalism was "there from the start".[10]
Winslet's acting career began on television, with a co-starring role in the BBC children's science fiction serial Dark Season.[11] This role was followed by appearances in the made-for-TV film Anglo-Saxon Attitudes in 1992, the sitcom Get Back,and an episode of the medical drama Casualty in 1993.[11]
In 1992, Winslet attended a casting call for Peter Jackson's Heavenly Creatures in London. Winslet auditioned for the part of Juliet Hulme, a teenager who assists in the murder of the mother of her best friend, Pauline Parker (played by Melanie Lynskey). She won the role over 175 other girls.[12] The film included Winslet's singing debut, and her a cappella version of "Sono Andati", an aria from La Bohème,[13] was featured on the film's soundtrack.[14] The film was released to favourable reviews in 1994 and won Jackson and partner Fran Walsh a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.[15] Winslet was awarded an Empire Award and a London Film Critics' Circle Award for British Actress of the Year for her performance.[16] The Washington Post writer Desson Thomson commented: "As Juliet, Winslet is a bright-eyed ball of fire, lighting up every scene she’s in. She's offset perfectly by Lynskey, whose quietly smoldering Pauline completes the delicate, dangerous partnership."[17] Speaking about her experience on a film set as an absolute beginner, Winslet noted: "With Heavenly Creatures, all I knew I had to do was completely become that person. In a way it was quite nice doing [the film] and not knowing a bloody thing."[18]
The following year, Winslet auditioned for the small but pivotal role of Lucy Steele in the adaptation of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, featuring Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman.[19] She was instead cast in the second leading role of Marianne Dashwood.[19] Director Ang Lee admitted he was initially worried about the way Winslet had attacked her role in Heavenly Creatures and thus required her to exercise t'ai chi, read Austen-era Gothic novels and poetry, and work with a piano teacher to fit the grace of the role.[19] Budgeted at US$16.5 million ($25.5 million in current year dollars) the film became a financial and critical success, resulting in a worldwide box office total of $135 million ($208.9 million) and various awards for Winslet, winning her both a BAFTA and a Screen Actors' Guild Award, and nominations for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe.[16][20]
In 1996, Winslet starred in both Jude and Hamlet. In Michael Winterbottom's Jude, based on the Victorian novel Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy, she played Sue Bridehead, a young woman with suffragette leanings who falls in love with her cousin, played by Christopher Eccleston. Acclaimed among critics, it was not a success at the box office, barely grossing $2 million ($3 million) worldwide.[21][22] Richard Corliss of Time magazine said "Winslet is worthy of [...] the camera's scrupulous adoration. She's perfect, a modernist ahead of her time [...] and Jude is a handsome showcase for her gifts."[23] Winslet played Ophelia, Hamlet's drowned lover, in Kenneth Branagh's all star-cast film version of William Shakespeare's Hamlet. The film garnered largely positive reviews and earned Winslet her second Empire Award.[16][24]
In mid-1996, Winslet began filming James Cameron's Titanic (1997), alongside Leonardo DiCaprio.[25] Gwyneth Paltrow, Claire Danes, and Gabrielle Anwar had been considered for the role;[26][27][28] when they turned it down, Winslet campaigned heavily for it. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, and thanks to assistance from her agent Hylda Queally, Cameron eventually invited her to Hollywood for auditions.[29] Cameron described the character as "an Audrey Hepburn type" and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him.[26] After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that she whispered to Cameron, "He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him." Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed "From Your Rose" and lobbied him by phone. "You don't understand!" she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. "I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!" Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.[26]
Cast as the sensitive seventeen-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater, a fictional first-class socialite who survives the 1912 sinking of the RMS Titanic, Winslet's experience was emotionally demanding.[30] "Titanic was totally different and nothing could have prepared me for it. ... We were really scared about the whole adventure. ... Jim [Cameron] is a perfectionist, a real genius at making movies. But there was all this bad press before it came out, and that was really upsetting."[30] Against expectations, the film went on to become the highest-grossing film of all time, grossing more than $1.843 billion ($2.8 billion) in box-office receipts worldwide,[31] and transformed Winslet into a commercial movie star.[32] Subsequently, she was nominated for most of the high-profile awards, winning a European Film Award.[16][33]
Hideous Kinky, a low-budget hippie romance shot before the release of Titanic, was Winslet's sole film of 1998.[34] Winslet had rejected offers to play the leading roles in Shakespeare in Love (1998) and Anna and the King (1999) in favour of the role of a young English mother named Julia who moves with her daughters from London to Morocco hoping to start a new life.[34][35] The film garnered generally mixed reviews and received only limited distribution,[36] resulting in a worldwide gross of $5 million ($7.1 million).[37] Despite the success of Titanic, the next film Winslet opted to star in was Holy Smoke! (1999), featuring Harvey Keitel, another low-budget project—much to the chagrin of her agents, who felt "miserable" about her preference of arthouse films.[18][30] Feeling pressured, Winslet has said she "never saw Titanic as a springboard for bigger films or bigger pay cheques", knowing that "it could have been that, but would have destroyed [her]."[38] That same year she voiced Brigid in the computer animated film Faeries.[39]
Winslet appeared in the period piece Quills with Geoffrey Rush and Joaquin Phoenix, released in 2000 and inspired by the life and work of the Marquis de Sade. The actress served as somewhat of a "patron saint" of the film for being the first big name to back it, accepting the role of a chambermaid in the asylum and the courier of the Marquis' manuscripts to the underground publishers.[40] Well received by critics, the film garnered numerous accolades for Winslet, including nominations for SAG and Satellite Awards.[16] The film was a modest arthouse success, averaging $27,709 ($37,947) per screen its debut weekend, and eventually grossing $18 million ($24.7 million) internationally.[41]
In 2001's Enigma, Winslet played a young woman who finds herself falling for a brilliant young World War II code breaker, played by Dougray Scott.[42] It was her first war film, and Winslet regarded "making Enigma a brilliant experience" as she was five months pregnant at the time of the shoot, forcing some tricky camera work from the director Michael Apted.[42] Generally well-received,[43] Winslet was awarded a British Independent Film Award for her performance,[16] and A. O. Scott of The New York Times described Winslet as "more crush-worthy than ever."[44] In the same year she appeared in Richard Eyre's critically acclaimed film Iris, portraying novelist Iris Murdoch. Winslet shared her role with Judi Dench, with both actresses portraying Murdoch at different phases of her life.[45] Subsequently, each of them was nominated for an Academy Award the following year, earning Winslet her third nomination.[16] Also in 2001, she voiced the character Belle in the animated motion picture Christmas Carol: The Movie, based on the Charles Dickens classic novel. For the film, Winslet recorded the song "What If", which was released in November 2001 as a single[46] with proceeds donated to two of Winslet's favourite charities, the N.S.P.C.C. and the Sargeant Cancer Foundation for Children.[46][47] A Europe-wide top ten hit, it reached number one in Austria, Belgium and Ireland,[48] number six on the UK Singles Chart,[49] and won the 2002 OGAE Song Contest.[50]
Her next film role was in the 2003 drama The Life of David Gale, in which she played an ambitious journalist who interviews a death-sentenced professor, played by Kevin Spacey, in his final weeks before execution. The film underperformed at international box offices, garnering only half of its $50,000,000 budget,[51] and generating mostly critical reviews,[52] with Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times calling it a "silly movie."[53]
Following The Life of David Gale, Winslet appeared with Jim Carrey in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), a neosurrealistic indie-drama by French director Michel Gondry. In the film, she played the role of Clementine Kruczynski, a chatty, spontaneous and somewhat neurotic woman, who decides to have all memories of her ex-boyfriend erased from her mind.[54] The role was a departure from her previous roles, with Winslet revealing in an interview with Variety that she was initially upended about her casting in the film: "This was not the type of thing I was being offered [...] I was just thrilled that there was something he had seen in me, in spite of the corsets, that he thought was going to work for Clementine."[55] The film was a critical and financial success.[56] Winslet received rave reviews for her Academy Award-nominated performance, which Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described as "electrifying and bruisingly vulnerable."[57]
Her final film in 2004 was Finding Neverland. The story of the production focused on Scottish writer J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) and his platonic relationship with Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Winslet), whose sons inspired him to pen the classic play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up. During promotion of the film, Winslet noted of her portrayal "It was very important for me in playing Sylvia that I was already a mother myself, because I don’t think I could have played that part if I didn’t know what it felt like to be a parent and have those responsibilities and that amount of love that you give to a child [...] and I've always got a baby somewhere, or both of them, all over my face."[58] The film received favourable reviews and proved to be an international success, becoming Winslet's highest-grossing film since Titanic with a total of $118 million worldwide.[59][60]
In 2005, Winslet appeared in an episode of the BBC|HBO comedy series Extras by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant as a satirical version of herself. While dressed as a nun, she was portrayed giving phone sex tips to the romantically challenged character of Maggie.[61] Her performance in the episode led to her first nomination for an Emmy Award.[16] In Romance & Cigarettes (2005), a musical romantic comedy written and directed by John Turturro, she played the character Tula, described by Winslet as "a slut, someone who’s essentially foulmouthed and has bad manners and really doesn’t know how to dress."[62] Hand-picked by Turturro, who was impressed with her display of dancing ability in Holy Smoke!, Winslet was praised for her performance,[62] which included her interpretation of Connie Francis's "Scapricciatiello (Do You Love Me Like You Kiss Me)".[63] Derek Elley of Variety wrote: "Onscreen less, but blessed with the showiest role, filthiest one-liners, [and] a perfect Lancashire accent that's comical enough in the Gotham setting Winslet throws herself into the role with an infectious gusto."[64]
After declining an invitation to appear in Woody Allen's film Match Point (2005), Winslet stated that she wanted to be able to spend more time with her children.[65] She began 2006 with All the King's Men, featuring Sean Penn and Jude Law. Winslet played the role of Anne Stanton, the childhood sweetheart of Jack Burden (Law). The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.[66][67] Todd McCarthy of Variety summed it up as "overstuffed and fatally miscast [...] Absent any point of engagement to become involved in the characters, the film feels stillborn and is unlikely to stir public excitement, even in an election year."[68]
Winslet fared far better when she joined the cast of Todd Field's Little Children, playing Sarah Pierce, a bored housewife who has a torrid affair with a married neighbour, played by Patrick Wilson. Both her performance and the film received rave reviews; A.O. Scott of The New York Times wrote: "In too many recent movies intelligence is woefully undervalued, and it is this quality—even more than its considerable beauty—that distinguishes Little Children from its peers. The result is a film that is challenging, accessible and hard to stop thinking about. Ms. Winslet, as fine an actress as any working in movies today, registers every flicker of Sarah’s pride, self-doubt and desire, inspiring a mixture of recognition, pity and concern that amounts, by the end of the movie, to something like love. That Ms. Winslet is so lovable makes the deficit of love in Sarah’s life all the more painful."[69] For her work in the film, she was honoured with a Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year from BAFTA/LA, a Los Angeles-based offshoot of the BAFTA Awards.[70] and nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, and at 31, became the youngest actress to ever garner five Oscar nominations.[71]
She followed Little Children with a role in Nancy Meyers' romantic comedy The Holiday, also starring Cameron Diaz, Jude Law and Jack Black. In it she played Iris, a British woman who temporarily exchanges homes with an American woman (Diaz). Released to a mixed reception by critics,[72] the film became Winslet's biggest commercial success in nine years, grossing more than $205 million worldwide.[73] Also in 2006, Winslet provided her voice for several smaller projects. In the CG-animated Flushed Away, she voiced Rita, a scavenging sewer rat who helps Roddy (Hugh Jackman) escape from the city of Ratropolis and return to his luxurious Kensington origins. A critical and commercial success, the film collected $177,665,672 at international box offices.[74]
In 2007, Winslet reunited with Leonardo DiCaprio to film Revolutionary Road (2008), directed by her husband at the time, Sam Mendes. Winslet had suggested that both should work with her on a film adaptation of the 1961 novel of the same name by Richard Yates after reading the script by Justin Haythe.[75] Resulting in both "a blessing and an added pressure" on-set, the reunion was her first experience working with Mendes.[76] Portraying a couple in a failing marriage in the 1950s, DiCaprio and Winslet watched period videos promoting life in the suburbs to prepare themselves for the film,[76] which earned them favourable reviews.[77] In his review of the film, David Edelstein of New York magazine stated that "[t]here isn’t a banal moment in Winslet’s performance—not a gesture, not a word. Is Winslet now the best English-speaking film actress of her generation? I think so."[5] Winslet was awarded a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her performance, her seventh nomination from the Golden Globes.[16]
Also released in late 2008, the film competed against Winslet's other project, a film adaptation of Bernhard Schlink's 1995 novel The Reader, directed by Stephen Daldry and featuring Ralph Fiennes and David Kross in supporting roles. Originally the first choice for her role, she was initially not able to take on the role due to a scheduling conflict with Revolutionary Road, and Nicole Kidman replaced her.[78] A month after filming began, however, Kidman left the film due to her pregnancy before filming of her had begun, enabling Winslet to rejoin the film.[78] Employing a German accent, Winslet portrayed a former Nazi concentration camp guard who has an affair with a teenager (Kross) who, as an adult, witnesses her war crimes trial.[79] She later said the role was difficult for her, as she was naturally unable "to sympathise with an SS guard."[80] Because the film required full frontal nudity, a merkin was made for her. In an interview for Allure she related how she refused to use it: "Guys, I am going to have to draw the line at a pubic wig,..."[81][82] While the film garnered mixed reviews in general,[83] Winslet received favourable reviews for her performance.[83] The following year, she earned her sixth Academy Award nomination and went on to win the Best Actress award, the BAFTA Award for Best Actress, a Screen Actors' Guild Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress, and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.[16]
In 2011, Winslet headlined in the HBO miniseries Mildred Pierce, a small screen adaptation of James M. Cain's 1941 novel of the same name, directed by Todd Haynes.[84] Co-starring Guy Pearce and Evan Rachel Wood, she portrayed a self-sacrificing mother during the Great Depression who finds herself separated from her husband and falling in love with a new man, all the while trying to earn her narcissistic daughter's love and respect. Broadcast to moderate ratings,[85] the five-part series earned generally favourable reviews,[86] with Salon.com calling it a "quiet, heartbreaking masterpiece".[87] Winslet won an Emmy Award,[88] a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film,[89] and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie for her performance.[90]
Also in 2011, Winslet appeared in Steven Soderbergh's disaster film Contagion, featuring an ensemble cast consisting of Marion Cotillard, Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law. The thriller follows the rapid progress of a lethal indirect contact transmission virus that kills within days. Winslet portrayed an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer who becomes infected with the disease over the course of her investigation.[91] Winslet's other 2011 film project, Roman Polanski's Carnage, premiered at the 68th Venice Film Festival. An adaptation of the play God of Carnage by French playwright Yasmina Reza, the black comedy follows two sets of parents who meet up to talk after their children have been in a fight that day at school. Jodie Foster, John C. Reilly and Christoph Waltz co-starred in the film, which critics felt was less "compelling on the screen as it was on the stage", but made "up for its flaws with Polanski's smooth direction and assured performances from Winslet and Foster."[92] For her performance Winslet received a second nomination by the Hollywood Foreign Press that year.[93]
In 2012, Winslet's audiobook performance of Émile Zola's Thérèse Raquin was released at Audible.com.[94] AudioFile's review said, "Kate Winslet reads as though she is relishing every morsel of the drama [...] She clearly loves the book, and her pleasure in the text is infectious. She grabs listeners and doesn’t let go."[95] Her first 2013 release was Movie 43, an independent anthology black comedy film that featured 14 different storylines, with each segment having a different director.[96] Winslet's segment, titled The Catch, was directed by Peter Farrelly and revolves around a single businesswoman who goes on a blind date with the city's most eligible bachelor, played by Hugh Jackman, only to be shocked when he removes his scarf, revealing a pair of testicles dangling from his neck.[97] The compilation film was universally panned by critics, with the Chicago Sun-Times calling it "the Citizen Kane of awful".[98]
In 2013, Winslet appeared in Jason Reitman's big screen adaptation of Joyce Maynard's 2009 novel Labor Day, also starring Josh Brolin and Tobey Maguire, which she declared "a very romantic movie, though a bizarre one."[99][100] While the film was met with a generally mixed reception from critics,[101] Winslet received favorable reviews for her portrayal of Adele, a mentally fragile, repressed single mom of a 13-year-old son who gives shelter to an escaped prisoner during a long summer week-end.[102] For her performance, Winslet earned her tenth Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama.[99][103]
In 2014, Winslet appeared in Divergent, Neil Burger's film adaptation of the 2011 young adult novel by Veronica Roth.[104] On playing the antagonist Jeanine Matthews in the film, Winslet said that "The idea went through my head that I have never played a baddie before, I was almost kind of surprised."[105] Her performance met with positive response from critics; Screendaily praised her performance as the antagonist as "understated",[106] while Indiewire said "Winslet is pure poison as Jeanine Matthews."[107]
Winslet will next appear alongside Matthias Schoenaerts in Alan Rickman's period drama A Little Chaos about rival landscape gardeners commissioned by Louis XIV to create a fountain at Versailles.[108] She will reprise her role of Jeanine Matthews in second installment of Divergent trilogy titled Insurgent, filming began on 27 May 2014.[109][110] She has also joined the cast of John Hillcoat's crime-thriller drama Triple Nine.[111] In addition she will star as Tilly Dunnage in Jocelyn Moorhouse's The Dressmaker with filming slated to start in late 2014.[112]
While on the set of the 1991 TV series Dark Season, Winslet met actor and writer Stephen Tredre, with whom she had a four-and-a-half-year relationship.[113] Winslet and Tredre remained close after their separation in 1995.[114] He died of bone cancer during the opening week of Titanic, causing her to miss the film's Los Angeles premiere to attend his funeral in London.[115]
On 22 November 1998, Winslet married film director Jim Threapleton, whom she met while on the set of Hideous Kinky in 1997.[116][117] They have a daughter, Mia Honey Threapleton,[117] who was born in October 2000 in London.[116] Winslet and Threapleton divorced on 13 December 2001.[118]
Following her separation from Threapleton, Winslet began a relationship with director Sam Mendes in 2001,[118] and she married him on 24 May 2003 on the island of Anguilla.[116] Their son, Joe Alfie Winslet Mendes, was born on 22 December 2003 in New York City.[116] Winslet and Mendes announced their separation in March 2010,[119] and divorced in 2011.[120][121]
In August 2011, a fire broke out at a residence in which Winslet, her children, and her then-boyfriend, model Louis Dowler, were staying on Necker Island, the private resort island of Virgin Group founder Richard Branson. The fire caused significant damage to the home, but no injuries.[122]
During the same August 2011 holiday on Necker Island, Winslet met fellow guest Ned Rocknroll, and they soon began dating.[123] Rocknroll was born Ned Abel Smith, but later legally changed his name.[124] He is a nephew of Richard Branson and works for Virgin Galactic, the space-travel division of his uncle's business.[123][125] Rocknroll was previously married to Eliza Pearson, daughter of Viscount Cowdray.[126] Winslet and Rocknroll became engaged in the summer of 2012.[127] It was announced in September 2012 that the couple had relocated from New York to live in the UK permanently, moving into a heritage home in South Downs National Park in West Sussex.[128][129] Winslet and Rocknroll married in a private ceremony in New York in December 2012.[127][130] The couple's son, Bear Blaze Winslet, was born in the County of Sussex, England, on 7 December 2013.[131][132]
Winslet's weight fluctuations over the years have been well documented by the media.[113][116] She has been outspoken about her refusal to allow Hollywood to dictate her weight.[133][134] In February 2003, the British edition of GQ magazine published photographs of Winslet that had been digitally altered to make her look dramatically thinner.[116] Winslet issued a statement that the alterations were made without her consent, saying, "I just didn't want people to think I was a hypocrite and that I'd suddenly lost 30 lbs or whatever".[135] GQ subsequently issued an apology.[134] She won a libel suit in 2009 against the British tabloid The Daily Mail after it printed that she had lied about her exercise regimen.[136] Winslet stated that she had requested an apology to demonstrate her commitment to the views that she has always expressed regarding women's body issues, namely that women should accept their appearance with pride.[136]
In 2010, Winslet narrated a video for PETA, encouraging chefs to remove foie gras from their menus and asking consumers to boycott restaurants that serve it. Winslet is a vegetarian.[137][138]
Winslet narrated the documentary A Mother's Courage: Talking Back to Autism, which focused on Keli Thorsteinsson, who has autism, and his mother, Margret Ericsdottir. The documentary was generally released on 24 September 2010, after airing on HBO in April of the same year. Her involvement in the documentary led to her founding the non-profit organisation, the Golden Hat Foundation, whose mission is to eliminate barriers for people with autism.[139][140] In 2011, Winslet received the Yo Dona award for Best Humanitarian Work for her work with the Golden Hat.[141]
Winslet won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in The Reader (2008). She won two Golden Globe Awards in the same year: Best Actress (Drama) for Revolutionary Road and Best Supporting Actress for The Reader. She has won two BAFTA Awards: Best Actress for The Reader, and Best Supporting Actress for Sense and Sensibility (1995). She has earned a total of six Academy Award nominations, ten Golden Globe nominations, and seven BAFTA nominations.[134][142][143]
She has received numerous awards from other organisations, including the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress for Iris (2001) and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role for Sense and Sensibility and The Reader. Premiere magazine named her portrayal of Clementine Kruczynski in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) as the 81st greatest film performance of all time.[144]
Winslet was selected for a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2012.[145] She received the star at 6262 Hollywood Blvd.[146] which was unveiled on 17 March 2014 at Saint Patrick's Day by Winslet with Kathy Bates and James Cameron as guest speakers at the unveiling ceremony.[147][148][149]
Winslet set the mark as the youngest actor to receive five nominations, at age 31, for Little Children (2006). She surpassed Bette Davis, who was 33 when she received her fifth nomination for her performance in The Little Foxes (1941).[150] With her Best Actress nomination for The Reader, Winslet became the youngest actor to receive six Oscar nominations. At age 33, Winslet passed the mark Davis, one year older, set with Now, Voyager (1942).[151]
Winslet received Academy Award nominations as the younger versions of the characters played by fellow nominees Gloria Stuart, as Rose, in Titanic (1997)[152] and Judi Dench, as Iris Murdoch, in Iris.[153] These are the only instances of the younger and older versions of a character in the same film both yielding Academy Award nominations, thus making Winslet the only actor to twice share an Oscar nomination with another for portraying the same character.[152]
When she was not nominated for her work in Revolutionary Road, Winslet became only the second actress to win a Golden Globe for Best Actress (Drama) without getting an Oscar nomination for the same performance (Shirley MacLaine was the first for Madame Sousatzka (1988), and she won the Golden Globe in a three-way tie). Academy rules allow an actor to receive no more than one nomination in a given category; as the Academy nominating process determined that Winslet's work in The Reader would be considered a lead performance—unlike the Golden Globes, which considered it a supporting performance—she could not also receive a Best Actress nomination for Revolutionary Road.[154][155]
In 2000, Winslet won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children for Listen To the Storyteller.[156][157] She was nominated for an Emmy Award Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for playing herself in a 2005 episode of Extras.[158] At the 2011 Primetime Emmy Awards, Winslet won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for her role as the titular character in Mildred Pierce.
She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to drama.[159][160]
NOTE: Many sources claim that she wore a merkin by only quoting part of this interview. This is the full quote from the printed issue:
"Let me tell you, The Reader was not glamorous for me in terms of body-hair maintenance. I had to grow it in, because you can't have a landing strip in 1950, you know? And then because of years of waxing, as all of us girls know, it doesn't come back quite the way it used to. They even made me a merkin because they were so concerned that I might not be able to grow enough. I said, 'Guys, I am going to have to draw the line at a pubic wig, but you can shoot my own snatch up close and personal.'"

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Ask Kate Winslet what she liked about any of her characters, and the word "ballsy" is bound to pop up at least once. The British actress has made a point of eschewing straightforward pretty-girl parts in favor of more devilish damsels; as a result, she's built an eclectic resume; that runs the gamut from Shakespearean tragedy to modern-day mysticism and erotica.Born into a family of thespians -- parents Roger Winslet and Sally Bridges-Winslet were both stage actors, maternal grandparents Oliver and Linda Bridges ran the Reading Repertory Theatre, and uncle Robert Bridges was a fixture in London's West End theatre district -- Kate came into her talent at an early age. She scored her first professional gig at 11, dancing opposite the Honey Monster in a commercial for a kids' cereal. She started acting lessons around the same time, which led to formal training at a performing arts high school. Over the next few years, she appeared on stage regularly and landed a few bit parts in sitcoms. Her first big break came at age 17, when she was cast as an obsessive adolescent in Heavenly Creatures (1994). The film, based on the true story of two fantasy-gripped girls who commit a brutal murder, received modest distribution but was roundly praised by critics.Still a relative unknown, Winslet attended a cattle call audition the next year for Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility (1995). She made an immediate impression on the film's star, Emma Thompson, and beat out more than a hundred other hopefuls for the part of plucky Marianne Dashwood. Her efforts were rewarded with both a British Academy Award and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Winslet followed up with two more period pieces, playing the rebellious heroine in Jude (1996) and Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet (1996).The role that transformed Winslet from art house attraction to international star was Rose DeWitt Bukater, the passionate, rosy-cheeked aristocrat in James Cameron's Titanic (1997). Young girls the world over both idolized and identified with Winslet, swooning over all that face time opposite heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio and noting her refreshingly healthy, unemaciated physique. Winslet's performance also garnered a Best Actress nomination, making her the youngest actress to ever receive two Academy Award nominations.After the swell of unexpected attention surrounding Titanic (1997), Winslet was eager to retreat into independent projects. Rumor has it that she turned down the lead roles in both Shakespeare in Love (1998) and Anna and the King (1999) in order to play adventurous soul searchers in Hideous Kinky (1998) and Holy Smoke (1999). The former cast her as a young single mother traveling through 1970s Morocco with her daughters in tow; the latter, as a zealous follower of a guru tricked into a "deprogramming" session in the Australian outback. The next year found her back in period dress as the Marquis de Sade's chambermaid and accomplice in Quills (2000). Kate holds the distinction of being the youngest actor ever honored with four Academy Award nominations (she received her fourth at age 29).Off camera, Winslet is known for her mischievous pranks and familial devotion. She has two sisters, Anna Winslet and Beth Winslet (both actresses), and a brother, Joss.In 1998, she married assistant director Jim Threapleton. They had a daughter, Mia Honey Threapleton, in October 2000. They divorced in 2001. She later married director Sam Mendes in 2003 and gave birth to their son, Joe Alfie Winslet-Mendes, later that year. After seven years of marriage, Kate announced that she and Sam amicably separated in February 2010. She was awarded Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2012 Queen's Birthday Honours List for her accomplishments in film and television.

      On the day she had to film the straitjacket scene in Hamlet (1996), she learned she had won the role of Rose DeWitt Bukater in Titanic (1997).
      While serving as host of Saturday Night Live (1975) one week after Ashlee Simpson's "recorded song malfunction", she opened the show by singing and dancing live.
      Her performance as Clementine Kruczynski in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) is ranked #81 on Premiere Magazine's 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006).

      Kate married Sam Mendes, who was childhood friends with Tom Hollander, with whom he went to Cambridge University and whom he directed in several plays. Tom and Kate were both in the film Enigma (2001).
      When interviewed on Good Morning America (1975) to promote her film The Holiday (2006), they surprised her by showing a clip which was supposedly Winslet on the Sugar Puff Commercial in 1987. However, the girl in the clip shown was not her. Winslet did not point out the error because she did not want to embarrass the researcher and get the person fired. She was then praised by the media for her caring and consideration of other people.
      Along with Claude Rains (for Mr. Skeffington (1944)), Vanessa Redgrave (for Julia (1977)), Mare Winningham (for Georgia (1995)) and Philip Seymour Hoffman (for The Master (2012)), she is one of the few performers to be nominated for an Supporting Oscar (for Iris (2000)) for playing the title role in a movie.

      As of 2009, she is only one of six performers who won a Golden Globe Award as Best Lead Actor/Actress in a Motion Picture Drama without being nominated for an Oscar for that same role (hers for Revolutionary Road (2008)).

However, of those six performers, Winslet is the only one to be nominated and win an Academy Award for a leading role but for a different role, in a same year.
      The producers of the The Reader (2008) tried to promote Winslet as Supporting Actress during the Oscar race 2009 in order to enhance her chances to get nominated twice (for Best Supporting Actress for The Reader (2008) and Best Lead Actress for her role in Revolutionary Road (2008)). The Academy overthrew this plan by nominating Winslet for Best Lead Actress for her performance in The Reader (2008), leaving aside her performance in Revolutionary Road (2008), although she won several other award nominations in both categories for the respective movies. According to Academy rules, an actor is eligible for only one nomination in a single category.

      [About her screen debut in Heavenly Creatures (1994)]: I was reading the script in the back of the car and I turned to my dad and yelled, "I've GOT to get this!" And he replied, "Then you will." And I thought, "Yep, that's it. I'm bloody well going to." And that was it. I was so determined. It was something crucial to my life. I just so communicated with her, the story and their relationship. And when I found out, I just couldn't believe it. I was so happy, I cried. I remember I was working part-time at a deli at the time because I didn't have any money and was in the middle of making a sandwich when they phoned and said I'd got the job. I burst into tears and had to leave work because I couldn't control myself. It was absolutely brilliant.
      In 2002, she had this to say about doing nude scenes: I like exposing myself. There's not an awful lot that embarrasses me. I'm the kind of actress that absolutely believes in exposing myself.
      I'd rather do theatre and British films than move to L.A. in hopes of getting small roles in American films.
      It's very important for me to make the statement that I am English and just because I've done one really big film, it doesn't mean that I don't want to keep a finger in the fantastic British film industry and do films like this.
      About her spur-of-the-moment marriage to Sam Mendes - We hadn't been planning to do it but we thought it was rather a good idea, so we just did it.
      After Titanic (1997), it would have been completely foolish for me to go and try and top that. I'm an English girl, I've always loved England, I've never felt the desire to leave it for any particular reason. And whilst I'm ambitious and care very much about what I do, I'm not competitive. I also don't want to act every day of my life. ... So it was important to me after Titanic (1997) to just remind myself of why it was that I was acting in the first place, which is of course because I love it.
      I was on the tube just before Christmas and this girl turned round to me and said, "Are you Kate Winslet?". And I said, "Well, yes. I am actually." And she said, "And you're getting the tube?" And I said, "Yes". And she said, "Don't you have a big car that drives you around?" And I said, "No". And she was absolutely stunned that I wasn't being driven round in some flash car all the time. It was ludicrous.
      People say to me, "You seem to have made this conscious decision to do independent films." In reality, I haven't. After each movie, I always think, how different can I possibly be?... Is this going to challenge me, is this going to inspire me, and is this going to make me love my job more than I already do?
      There is no way we are going to move out of England. Some might think that we want to live in Hollywood but that is not what we want at all. We will go and live in New York when it is necessary because of work but we prefer to be in England. I'm proud to be English - we both are. It's very important to me to retain that. I am an English girl and I love England. I have never felt the desire to leave. I am still ambitious and I will have to travel and live elsewhere because of that but England is always home.
      On a scene from the movie Holy Smoke (1999): It was a difficult scene. When I read the script and I saw this scene was there, I laughed hysterically. I just couldn't believe it. When it came to shooting it, I had been sort of putting it off, and pretending it wasn't going to happen. And suddenly, I am there naked, peeing and thinking "Oh no!" It was really hard to do, but I've always loved the fact that it was there, and it's such a sort of turning point for the character I play in the movie that I've always felt sort of good, that it should be there.
      On receiving her 4th Oscar nomination: I can't believe it. I am ecstatic! This nomination means so much to me. To be remembered for a film that was released a while ago, I am unbelievably honoured and completely overwhelmed.
      Mum and dad were very much friends, and up to life. There was no anxiety for anything when I was growing up, they just taught me to be me.
      I don't know if it's a skill, but I have been really lucky. I've always got on with every actor I've had to work opposite. I just always try and be as accepting of that person as I possibly can, and remain non-judgmental about their process, because every actor works in a different way.
      I was a wayward child, very passionate and very determined. If I made up my mind to do something, there was no stopping me.
      On going to the 1996 Oscars: Emma Thompson said to me "Listen, it's honestly just like going to see a fantastic show", and actually it really is, because there are so many people to look at and all those fabulous frocks and it's really fascinating. But mum and dad and I did kind of amble through it a bit, a bit like the Beverly Hillbillies, getting out the car, my mum stepping on my dress and I'm going "Mum, mum!".
      I'm really proud of being English, because I learned my job in England, in English films with English actors. But I never dared dream of such a success... it's more than a dream. I realize it's extraordinary for a British actress. I feel good, but guilty at the same time, cause I wish I could share this emotion with all my British actors' friends... I play the main character in the most expensive and probably successful film, but that's not a good reason to leave England and become a superstar. Not at all.
      [November 2000] On taking chances in Hollywood: If you're not still learning and growing as an actor, then you have no backbone and no career.
      My skin still crawls if you call me a movie star. I get embarrassed. I think, don't be ridiculous. Maybe it's because I'm British. To me, Julia Roberts that's a movie star. But when people do call me one, that, I think, is an enormous compliment but, my God, is that a responsibility!
      [About being nominated in the same category as superstar Meryl Streep] It feels unbelievable to be mentioned in the same breath as fellow actress Meryl Streep. It's inconceivable to me that this would even happen in my lifetime at all. It's such a dream.

                Kate Winslet says she wanted to be an actress from the age of five but because her family members were stage actors, she was not aware of the world of film. She attended Redroofs Theatre School and made her debut television performance, aged 11, dancing in front of the breakfast cereal mascot, the Honey Monster.It is ironic her first role was advertising for food because as effortlessly down-to-earth as she seems, Winslet suffered at the hands of bullies throughout her adolescence. She was trapped in the art cupboard at school and taunted by the nickname ‘Blubber’ for being overweight. It is this experience that incenses her to stand up against the trend to shed weight. “I was like all those girls,’’ she said. “It was an unstoppable feeling. I starved myself. So seductive - all my bones sticking out.” “I was that child, looking at the images of models in films, magazines and fashion shows. This is what girls are brought up to believe, that to be thin is to be loved, adored, perfect. That's how they'll get a boyfriend - by becoming like a stick insect.” Winslet’s early roles were small parts in television until 1994, when she won the role of Juliet Hulme in Peter Jackson’s Heavenly Creatures which set her on an extraordinary path for a girl not yet 20-years-old. Heavenly Creatures was a film based on the true story of two girls who murdered one of their mothers. Winslet played a slightly perverse, intense role which was just short of over-the-top but won her the admiration of critics. Next up was Ang Lee's Jane Austen revival, Sense and Sensibility. Lee called Winslet a “bold, raw talent’’ and said Winslet fainted on set several times, so immersed was she in the masochistic, intense romanticism of her character, Marianne. So by her late teens, Winslet had been directed by Peter Jackson and Ang Lee and starred alongside Emma Thompson who Winslet reveres and remains close with. Winslet’s next big role was opposite rising star Leonardo DiCaprio in 1997’s Titanic, the top-grossing movie of all time by a nautical mile. Love the movie or hate it - you’ve most likely seen it. And so she looked set to become part of the Hollywood machine, just another star collecting her millions from the big-budget monsters. However, Winslet has always appeared to stand apart from the other plastic Hollywood starlets, never falling drunk out of a nightclub at 4am or fussing if a nail breaks. She calls a spade a bloody shovel and rejects the trappings of super-stardom.Following Titanic, Winslet retained her art-house credentials, turning down scripts from America, choosing instead to star in a modest British film, Hideous Kinky. Winslet starred as a flaky yet driven hippie who decamps to Morocco with two daughters in the early 1970s. It was on location in Morocco filming Hideous Kinky that Winslet met assistant director Jim Threapleton in 1998. She said she saw him and “just knew’’. They married in November that year in her home town of Reading and the couple were blessed by the same vicar who baptised Kate as a child. The wedding cemented Winslet as a rare down-to-earth celebrity as the reception was held at the bride's favourite pub, The Crooked Billet, where guests dined on bangers and mash. In 2000, the couple had a daughter called Mia but they separated the following year and were divorced by Christmas 2001. By the time the split was finalised Winslet had met her second husband-to-be, director Sam Mendes whom she would marry in 2003. In Jane Campion's 1999 film, Holy Smoke, Winslet plays Ruth, a young woman who goes to India with a friend and meets a guru (Harvey Keitel). In the film, there is a scene where Winslet stands naked in the Australian scrubland with a great sky behind her, and urinates on to the sand. She wasn't actually urinating, she says; there was a saline drip attached behind her head. However she claims she did insist on trying one take for real. “And the problem is, of course, that the wee dribbles down one leg.’’ In 2000, it was back to petticoats as Winslet portrayed a laundress who colludes with the incarcerated Marquis de Sade to help smuggle out his writings in Quills. In Enigma, the World War II-era spy drama, she took a role that was less emotionally charged, instead more subtle. In Iris she played the youthful incarnation of British philosopher and novelist Iris Murdoch. In 2003, a year before the release of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Winslet and Mendes were married in a top secret wedding in the West Indies. The wedding was attended by three close friends and her daughter Mia. The couple, who are still together, have a son called Joe Alfie Winslet Mendes. Perhaps motherhood encouraged her to try different roles. In 2006 she voiced the streetwise Rita, a rat living in a vast sewer metropolis stumbled upon by a pampered pet mouse Rody (Hugh Jackman), in the animated comedy Flushed Away. Her role in Little Children earned her another Academy Award nomination. She told television talk show host Michael Parkinson that nude scenes never got any easier. She was unable to watch the film, in particular the love-making scenes, with husband Sam Mendes so he went to see her performance on his own. Winslet wept during the Parkinson interview when she revealed Mendes had come home in tears after seeing the film and told her he was incredibly proud of his talented wife. Winslet says she doesn’t read reviews because they give such a distorted opinion, “What matters to me is what my mum, dad and husband think.’’In chick flick The Holiday, Winslet stars with Cameron Diaz, as a woman so totally over men she decides to house-swap and take a break in America. Winslet got caught in a cross-cultural faux pas when she told reporters: “Cameron could eat me under the table.’’ To the Brits the sentence sounds like nothing more than Diaz being a big eater, in American parlance the phrase takes on a lewd connotation referring to oral sex. In typical Winslet fashion, she laughed it off - even though she says the producer looked as if she was “about to vomit’’ when she made the gaff. Winslet and Mendes were given a nod in August 2007’s InStyle Magazine for being the best Old School Hollywood couple for their stylish red-carpet public appearances. Typically for Winslet but rather unusually for a celebrity, she was revealed as the face of Lancôme’s Tresor perfume but she only accepted the modeling job if the company promised not to airbrush her for the poster campaign. Anna Winslet, Kate’s older sister, told reporters: “Kate and I don’t think men like skinny, pointy, spikey women. She feels women should be allowed to be the natural shape they are without having to conform into some sort of image that is never going to be what their make-up is really about.’’ Titanic star Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet appeared again as a couple in Revolutionary Road, released in 2009. In the same year Winslet won the Oscar for best actress for her role in The Reader.

Welcome to Kate Winslet Fan, a fansite 100% dedicated to the Oscar-winning English actress! Here you will find the most comprehensive information on Kate's personal life and an in-depth scoop on her film and TV career, an extensive photo gallery and videos archive and a lot more! Enjoy your visit and don't forget to leave feedback! 
Kate Elizabeth Winslet was born on October 5, 1975 to Sally Bridges Winslet and Roger Winslet into an acting family and was raised in Reading, Berkshire, England. Her maternal grandparents, Oliver, a dentist, and Linda Bridges, founded and perated the Reading Repertory. Her maternal uncle, Robert Bridges was an actor and is best known for playing Mr. Bumble in the West End production of Oliver!. Her father is an actor as are her older sister Anna and younger sister Beth. The youngest of the four Winslet children is brother Joss.
Kate’s first “professional” role was in a Sugar Puffs cereal commercial at the age of 11. As a teen, she had roles in the British television series, Dark Season and Get Back. She also made appearances on the shows Casualty,
Shrinks and Anglo Saxon Attitudes — an experience that first opened her eyes about her weight. She had a small part, as the daughter of a very heavyset woman. One afternoon, the director strolled past the two actors, sized them up and observed: “God, the likeness is extraordinary”. The comment shocked Winslet who, at 5’6” ft was weighing 185 pounds. “I looked at this woman, who weighed nearly 300 pounds, and I just thought, Shit, shit, this has got to change. This has got to go”.
Stage experience was obtained through roles in Adrian Mole, Peter Pan, Annie and What The Butler Saw (a performance for which she was nominated as Best Supporting Actress by the Manchester Evening News).Kate attended
the Redroofs School (a performing arts school) in Maidenhead, England. A younger classmate stated in a television interview: “She used to help us with school work. I was only 8 when I came, so she sort of looked after me”. Another classmate who sat next to Kate in acting class said: “I know she loved what she did & she did have an
She was so much more of an adult than we were. She was very friendly with the teachers because she was a mature girl. So, she would call them by their first names and she would go and talk to them. But she was on their level, basically… We were doing the play Steel Magnolias and we had to cut it down to about 10 minutes. And she said, ‘Oh, I tell you what: I’ll take it home for you and I’ll type it up for you, and I’ll cut it properly for you’. And she was like that.
She would just offer to do things”. The principal commented: “She was always very good on the dance side. The head of dance thought she might make a wonderful teacher. Kate obviously had other ideas… We thought, ‘yes, this girl is going to go places’, but we never dreamt how fast and how far”.
The big break came when Kate was 17 years old. Before she landed her first movie role, Kate worked in a deli. She was in the middle of making a pastrami sandwich when she received the call that she’d been cast to play Juliet Hulme in the film Heavenly Creatures, winning the part over 175 other actresses. Director Peter Jackson said: “Her intensity made everybody else auditioning for the part pale in comparison”. Kate’s next hit was Ang Lee’s Sense And Sensibility, which was filmed in the spring of 1995. Along with success, this also gave Kate a 
In her breakthrough role in “Heavenly Creatures” and her Oscar-nominated turn in “Sense & Sensibility”
She starved herself and dropped lots of pounds. “At 19, I went from pillar to post about my body and spent at least 95% of my head-space every day thinking about what I bloody looked like”, she says. While filming, co-star and close friend Emma Thompson noticed that she’d skip lunch and not eat properly. “Emma said to me: ‘If you dare try and lose weight for this job, I will be furious with you’. She went out and bought me “The Beauty Myth”, and since then, I’ve been much more relaxed about that side of it.
It was with her portrayal of Rose in blockbuster Titanic that Kate gained recognition worldwide. This was a part she strongly fought for. “I closed the script, wept floods of tears and said, ‘Right, I’ve absolutely got to be a part of this. No two ways about it’”. She phoned her agent, and the agent made a couple of calls. Winslet said, “Look, just get me Jim Cameron’s phone number.” She dialed the director’s car phone. “He was on the freeway, and he said, ‘I’m going somewhere’. And I think he pulled over, and I said, ‘I just have to do this, and you are really mad if you don’t cast me”. When Leonardo DiCaprio waffled about signing to play Jack and both actors were at the Cannes Film Festival, Winslet discovered where DiCaprio was staying, slipped out of a press junket and collared him in his hotel room. “I was thinking, ‘I’m going to persuade him to do this, because I’m not doing it without him, and that’s all there is to it’”, she says.
Unfortunately at the time the film was released, Kate’s close friend and former sweetheart Stephen Tredre passed on. During her teen years, she became involved with actor/writer Tredre. They were together over four years when he learned he had bone cancer. Although they ended their intimate relationship, Kate has said that she and Stephen remained close and she hopes she was a comfort to him. She has commented that Stephen was the closest person to her outside her family. Kate flew from Marrakech (where she was shooting her next film) to sing at Tredre’s memorial, a song whose title she won’t reveal: “It was a song that he always loved me singing. I felt like Elton John must have felt singing at Di’s funeral. It was so hard. I knew that if I said a few words beforehand, I would start crying and I wouldn’t be able to sing. So I sang, and the second I stopped I started to choke.”
It was the 1998 independent film Hideous Kinky that had the biggest impact on her life: it was on this set that she met her first husband, assistant director Jim Threapleton. On November 22, 1998, they tied the knot in a low-key ceremony. Kate decided to spend the next few months concentrating on her new role as wife and declined many film offers. “The first year of marriage you never get again, and it’s so important to lay those foundations”. She chose Quills partly because it was filmed at a studio not far from her home.
In the summer of 2000, Kate began recording audio books of Enid Blyton’s trilogy “The Enchanted Wood”, “The Magic Faraway Tree” and “The Folk Of The Faraway Tree”. “These were really the favorite books from my childhood”, said Kate. “It just occurred to me one day to find out what had happened to them”. The “Enchanted Wood” was released on October 21, 2000. Enid Blyton Company’s head of publishing, Ian Wallace, described Kate as “brilliant”, and commented: “She is an amazing reader, very professional”. Kate also performed on the audio CD “Listen To The Storyteller”, for which she (and
Kate announced in March 2001 that she had accepted a role in Iris, playing young Iris Murdoch. She embraced the challenge of playing Iris by watching documentaries about her over and over. Inspired “by the way Iris lived her life”,
Kate noted: “I’ve always felt very much the same – you have to make the most of every day, always look forward, have no regrets and learn from the good things and bad things that happen”.
Also in 2001, Kate lent her voice to a new ani-mated version of Christmas Carol – The Movie, bringing life to Belle, Scrooge’s (voiced by Simon Callow, from Four Weddings And A Funeral) jilted fiancée, and Hollywood actor Nicolas Cage voices The Ghost of Marley. Kate’s recording of a song for the soundtrack (“What If?”) was released as a single in November. It was the #1 single in Ireland in its second week of release (holding that spot for several weeks), debuted in the UK Top 40 at #6, hit #1 in Belgium and Austria, and hit the Top Ten in several countries.
In February 2000, Kate’s US publicists announced that Kate and Jim were expecting their first child that fall. Kate has said in interviews that she wants “to be a young mum so that my experience of being a child and a teenager is still fresh. I adore babies and children”.
Kate gave birth to a girl on October 12, 2000, who was named Mia Honey. “That’s my latest production, that’s my best production so far. She’s just great. It’s really sort of an amazing feeling (…) It’s interesting how much Mia has enhanced my life and how much she has given me. I feel very strong and independent, even though I am with her so much of the time. I actually feel more independent than before, which is an odd thing to say. But, as a parent, you are given a bizarre strength by Mother Nature and it means you can deal with anything and be happy because you have this little baby. Mia, fortunately, loves moving around and loves people”.
In September of 2001 she and Jim split up; the announcement was made on September 3rd. Kate gave no reason at that time for the split, simply stating: “This is an absolutely amicable separation and it is a mutual decision. Jim and I have great respect for each other. There is no malice at all. It is extremely sad but we are all fine. Jim and I are both communicating constantly. Mia remains the happy child that she always has been”. She has also said, “Divorce is not a pleasant experience and it does take a lot out of you. Jim and I, though, have handled it about as well as anyone, I think, and there hasn’t been any of the acrimony that some press articles suggested last year. We’ve sorted things out and we haven’t had any difficulties at all, really. Jim and I have been able to both spend time taking care of Mia while one or the other of us has been working, and there’s no rancour between us”.
At the December 2, 2001 premiere of Iris, Kate made her first public appearance with Sam Mendes, acclaimed theater director and Oscar-winning director of American Beauty. She re-marked to a reporter: “He’s a good man. You can say I
said that with a very large smile on my face. It’s one of those unexplainable things that we’re together”. Sam revealed during an interview in the fall of 2001: “I have nothing to hide and I want to make sure the truth is clearly stated about us. Yes, we are having a relationship. It’s early days and we’re very happy… It happened and it’s happening. I am delighted to express my happiness at being with Kate… We didn’t acknowledge what we were feeling about each other until sometime in September. It was absolutely appropriate as I was not in a relationship and neither was Kate”.
Kate said: “The worst thing that was written was that my relationship with Sam had begun before my marriage dissolved and was the cause for my divorce. That is utter nonsense and an absolute lie. I don’t understand why the press tries to imply the worst in everyone, and particularly in me. I think I’ve tried to carve out an intelligent career and I think I’ve done some good work and I think my private life has been fairly mundane”.
Kate and Sam first met around August 2001 to discuss the possibility of working together. While a professional relationship failed to materialise, a romance blossomed. They secretly married in a simple ceremony in the Caribbean on May 24, 2003. The wedding was so last minute, the couple didn’t have time to buy rings, so Kate used one Sam had given her for Valentine’s Day and he bought his own locally. Kate admits: “Although he paid for it, I still haven’t given him the money back!”. Kate remarked: “We make each other really happy. We’re both pretty patient people, and I think that has a lot to do with it. At the end of the day, we really understand each other and respect what we both do for a living and also admire it, too, I think, as well. I think that has a great deal to do with it. And honesty – I think that honesty is the most important thing in a relationship. We have all those things. And he makes me laugh, too – a lot”.
Kate accepted the role in The Life Of David Gale and commented: “At a time like this [separation from her husband], when things have been a little turbulent for me, it’s fantastic to be rewarded with the leading lady role in an American film. It’s bloody fantastic”. Kate completed her scenes in December and returned home on the 23rd to spend Christmas with her family.
In January of 2003, Kate started shooting Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, her favorite. “When I read the script, I thought: ‘Great, I get to change my hair color.’ (…) I’d arrive at work in the morning and my hair would be orange and by lunch time it would have to be red”, says Kate. “It was so challenging and so much fun. I just literally got to play around every day and try stuff out and push my character right to the edge”.
On December 22, 2003 Kate gave birth to her and Sam’s first child, a boy they named Joe Alfie. “I just had a baby. His father is a wonderful… I will start crying in a minute because I’m so emotional. Excuse me… I’m very, very happy right now”, she told the host of Inside The Actors Studio. It was only weeks after Joe was born that Kate started filming Romance & Cigarettes, a low-budget dark comic musical that tells the story of one man’s journey into infidelity and redemption directed by John Turturro and starring James Gandolfini and Susan Sarandon.
Receiving two more Golden Globe nominations for “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” and “Finding Neverland”
Kate plays “the other woman” in Gandolfini’s life, described by Kate as “a brazen hussy”. During her last
week of filming, she twisted her ankle while doing a dance sequence at a hotel suite with Gandolfini. ” directed and written by John Turturro.
Although it finished filming in the summer of 2002, Finding Neverland, a film based on the play “The Man Who Was Peter Pan”, which focuses on how Pan’s author J.M. Barrie was inspired to write his story after bonding with four fatherless children who lived next door to him in 1800′s London, was only released in late 2004. Directed by Monster’s Ball‘s Marc Forster and co-starring Johnny Depp as Barrie, Julie Christie as Winslet’s character’s mother and Dustin Hoffman as Barrie’s manager, Kate plays Sylvia, the mother of four children, one of whom, Peter, inspired Barrie’s most famous play Peter Pan.
After being nominated for two Golden Globe Awards for both her performances in Eternal Sunshine and Finding Neverland, and her fourth Oscar nomination (for Eternal Sunshine), Kate appeared as a guest star in Ricky Gervais’ hysterical series Extras, in which she plays a nun and mocks the fact she’s never won an Oscar although having received four nominations, and began shooting two of her next projects, All The King’s Men and Little Children. The first, a big-budget portrait of shady politics in 1940s Louisiana, she plays Anne Stanton, a glamorous beauty bruised by lost love; the latter, a micro-budget indie intimate study of suburban angst, Kate is an adulterous mother who, according to director Todd Field, handles her child “like a piece of luggage she’s dragging through the airport”. As a mother herself, Kate found it very difficult to have to be cold with the little girl in some of the scenes.
Signing up to play a cheating spouse was an easier decision for Winslet than accepting Nancy Meyers’ offer to co-star with Cameron Diaz and Jack Black in 2006′s The Holiday, which is her first romantic comedy ever. Kate has commented, ‘There’s a certain amount of potential for exposure as a human being that goes hand in hand with being involved in a bigger studio picture like that. (…) I hadn’t done something that commercial since Titanic, [so] I took a deep breath and decided it was time’. This year, she was also the voice of mouse Rita in DreamWorks’ CGI animation Flushed Away.
In 2007, Kate signed up to do Revolutionary Road, with her husband as the director and nothing less but Titanic‘s co-star Leonardo DiCaprio. A tale about a couple struggling with the 50s society. In its release in late 2008, this film received several awards, including the Golden Globes, for which Kate won hers.
But it was with The Reader, that Kate guaranteed her place in the Hollywood sun. A story based on a book by German author Bernhard Schlink, it opens in post-WWII Germany when teenager Michael Berg falls for Hanna Schmitz, a woman twice his age. As Hanna’s past is revealed, Michael uncovers a deep secret that will impact both of their lives. It is a story about truth and reconciliation, about how one generation comes to terms with the crimes of another. Kate gave one of the most powerful performances ever seen, and that too, earned her her second Golden Globe in 2009 and also her long awaited Oscar statuette.
