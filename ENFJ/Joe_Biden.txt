Joseph Robinette "Joe" Biden, Jr. (/ˈdʒoʊsɨf rɒbɨˈnɛt ˈbaɪdən/; born November 20, 1942) is the 47th and current Vice President of the United States, jointly elected with President Barack Obama. He is a member of the Democratic Party and was a United States Senator from Delaware from January 3, 1973, until his resignation on January 15, 2009, following his election to the Vice Presidency. In 2012, Biden was elected to a second term alongside Obama.
Biden was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and lived there for ten years before moving to Delaware. He became an attorney in 1969, and was elected to the New Castle County council in 1970. Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972 and became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history. He was re-elected to the Senate six times, and was the fourth most senior senator at the time of his resignation. Biden was a long-time member and former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. His strong advocacy helped bring about U.S. military assistance and intervention during the Bosnian War. He opposed the Gulf War in 1991. He voted in favor of the Iraq War Resolution in 2002, but later proposed resolutions to alter U.S. strategy there. He has also served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, and led creation of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and Violence Against Women Act. He chaired the Judiciary Committee during the contentious U.S. Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.
Biden unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008, both times dropping out early in the race. Barack Obama selected Biden to be the Democratic Party nominee for Vice President in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Biden is the first Roman Catholic and the first Delawarean to become Vice President of the United States. As Vice President, Biden has been heavily involved in Obama's decision-making process and held the oversight role for infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package aimed at counteracting the late-2000s recession. His ability to negotiate with Congressional Republicans played a key role in bringing about the bipartisan deals that resulted in the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 that resolved a taxation deadlock, the Budget Control Act of 2011 that resolved that year's debt ceiling crisis, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 that addressed the impending "fiscal cliff".
Biden was born on November 20, 1942, at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania,[1] the son of Joseph Robinette Biden, Sr. (1915–2002)[2] and Catherine Eugenia "Jean" Biden (née Finnegan; 1917–2010).[3] He was the first of four siblings in a Catholic family, with a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, James and Frank, following.[4] His mother was of Irish descent, with roots variously attributed to County Londonderry[5][6] or County Louth.[7] His paternal grandparents, Mary Elizabeth (Robinette) and Joseph H. Biden, an oil businessman from Baltimore, had English, French, and Irish ancestry.[6][8] His maternal great-grandfather, Edward Francis Blewitt,[9] was a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate.[10]
Biden's father had been very well-off earlier in his life, but had suffered several business reverses by the time Biden was born,[11] and for several years the family had to live with Biden's maternal grandparents, the Finnegans.[11] When the Scranton area went into economic decline during the 1950s, Biden's father could not find enough work.[12] In 1953, the Biden family moved to an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, where they lived for a few years before moving to a house in Wilmington, Delaware.[11] Joe Biden Sr. then did better as a used car salesman, and the family's circumstances were middle class.[11][12][13]
Biden attended the Archmere Academy in Claymont,[14] where he was a standout halfback/wide receiver on the high school football team; he helped lead a perennially losing team to an undefeated season in his senior year.[11][15] He played on the baseball team as well.[11] During these years, he participated in an anti-segregation sit-in at a Wilmington theatre.[16] Academically, Biden received mostly 'B' grades, but he was a natural leader among the students, and was elected class president during his junior and senior years.[17][18] He graduated in 1961.[17]
Biden attended the University of Delaware in Newark, where he was more interested in sports and socializing than in studying,[11] although his classmates were impressed by his cramming abilities.[16] He played halfback with the Blue Hens freshman football team.[15] In 1964, while on spring break in the Bahamas,[19] he met and began dating Neilia Hunter, who was from an affluent background in Skaneateles, New York, and who attended Syracuse University.[11][20] He told her that he aimed to become a Senator by the age of 30 and then President.[21] He dropped a junior year plan to play for the varsity football team as a defensive back, enabling him to spend more time visiting out of state with her.[15][22] He double majored in history and political science and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1965,[23] ranking 506th of 688 in his class.[24]
He then entered Syracuse University College of Law (where he would be near her), receiving a half scholarship based on financial need with some additional assistance based in part upon academics.[25] By his own description he found law school to be "the biggest bore in the world" and pulled many all-nighters to get by.[16][26] During his first year there, he was accused of having plagiarized 5 of 15 pages of a law review article. Biden said it was inadvertent due to his not knowing the proper rules of citation, and he was permitted to retake the course after receiving an 'F' grade, which was subsequently dropped from his record.[26] He received his Juris Doctor in 1968,[27] graduating 76th of 85 in his class.[25] He was admitted to the Delaware Bar in 1969.[27]
Biden received five student draft deferments during this period, with the first coming in late 1963 and the last in early 1968, at the peak of the Vietnam War.[28] In April 1968, he was reclassified by the Selective Service System as not available for service due to having had asthma as a teenager.[28][29] Biden was generally supportive of the war during much of this time[21] and never became part of the anti-Vietnam War movement; he would later say that at the time he was preoccupied with marriage and law school, and that he "wore sports coats ... not tie-dyed".[30]
Negative impressions of drinking alcohol in the Biden and Finnegan families and in the neighborhood led to Joe Biden becoming a teetotaler.[11][31] Biden suffered from stuttering through much of his childhood and into his twenties;[32] he overcame it by spending many hours reciting poetry in front of a mirror.[18]
On August 27, 1966, Biden, while still a law student, married Hunter.[23] They overcame her parents' initial reluctance for her to wed a Roman Catholic, and the ceremony was held in a Catholic church in Skaneateles.[33] They had three children, Joseph R. "Beau" Biden III (born 1969), Robert Hunter (born 1970), and Naomi Christina (born 1971).[23]
During 1968, Biden clerked for six months at a Wilmington law firm headed by prominent local Republican William Prickett and, as he later said, "thought of myself as a Republican".[21][34] He disliked the conservative racial politics of incumbent Democratic Governor of Delaware Charles L. Terry and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson, who defeated Terry in 1968.[21] The local Republicans tried to recruit Biden, but he resisted due to his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard M. Nixon, and registered as an Independent instead.[21]
In 1969, Biden resumed practicing law in Wilmington, first as a public defender and then at a firm headed by Sid Balick, a locally active Democrat.[16][21] Balick named Biden to the Democratic Forum, a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party,[35] and Biden switched his registration to Democratic.[21] Biden also started his own firm, Biden and Walsh.[16] Corporate law, however, did not appeal to him and criminal law did not pay well.[11] He supplemented his income by managing properties.[36]
Later in 1969, Biden ran as a Democrat for the New Castle County Council on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburban area.[16] He won by a solid, two-thousand vote margin in the usually Republican district and in a bad year for Democrats in the state.[16][37] Even before taking his seat, he was already talking about running for the U.S. Senate in a couple of years.[37] Biden served on the County Council from 1970 to 1972[27] while continuing his private law practice.[38] Among issues he addressed on the council was his opposition to large highway projects that might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods, including those related to Interstate 95.[39]
Biden's entry into the 1972 U.S. Senate election in Delaware presented a unique circumstance. Longtime Delaware political figure and Republican incumbent Senator J. Caleb Boggs was considering retirement, which would likely have left U.S. Representative Pete du Pont and Wilmington Mayor Harry G. Haskell, Jr. in a divisive primary fight. To avoid that, U.S. President Richard M. Nixon helped convince Boggs to run again with full party support.[40] No other Democrat wanted to run against Boggs.[16] Biden's campaign had virtually no money and was given no chance of winning.[11] It was managed by his sister Valerie Biden Owens (who would go on to manage his future campaigns as well) and staffed by other members of his family, and relied upon handed-out newsprint position papers and meeting voters face-to-face;[41] the small size of the state and lack of a major media market made the approach feasible.[36] Biden did receive some assistance from the AFL-CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell.[16] Biden's campaign issues focused on withdrawal from Vietnam, the environment, civil rights, mass transit, more equitable taxation, health care, the public's dissatisfaction with politics-as-usual, and "change".[16][41] During the summer, Biden trailed by almost 30 percentage points,[16] but his energy level, his attractive young family, and his ability to connect with voters' emotions gave the surging Biden an advantage over the ready-to-retire Boggs.[13] Biden won the November 7, 1972, election in an upset by a margin of 3,162 votes.[41]
On December 18, 1972, a few weeks after the election, Biden's wife and one-year-old daughter were killed in an automobile accident while Christmas shopping in Hockessin, Delaware.[23] Neilia Biden's station wagon was hit by a tractor-trailer as she pulled out from an intersection; the truck driver was cleared of any wrongdoing.[42][nb 1] Biden's sons Beau and Hunter survived it and were taken to the hospital in fair condition, Beau with a broken leg and other wounds, Hunter with a minor skull fracture and other head injuries.[44] Doctors soon said both would make full recoveries.[45] Biden considered resigning to care for them,[13] but was persuaded not to by Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield.[46]

Joe Biden met his second wife, Jill (here seen dancing together in 2009), in 1975 and they married in 1977.
When Biden was sworn into office on January 5, 1973, by Francis R. Valeo, the Secretary of the Senate, it was in a small chapel at the Delaware Division of the Wilmington Medical Center.[44][48] Beau was wheeled in with his leg still in traction; Hunter, who had already been released, was also there, as were other members of the extended family.[44][48] Witnesses and television cameras were also present and the event received national attention.[44][48]
At age 30 (the minimum age required to hold the office), Biden became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history.[49] But the accident left him filled with both anger and religious doubt: "I liked to [walk around seedy neighborhoods] at night when I thought there was a better chance of finding a fight ... I had not known I was capable of such rage ... I felt God had played a horrible trick on me."[50] To be at home every day for his young sons,[51] Biden began the practice of commuting every day by Amtrak train for 1½ hours each way from his home in the Wilmington suburbs to Washington, D.C., which he continued to do throughout his Senate career.[13] In the aftermath of the accident, he had trouble focusing on work, and appeared to just go through the motions of being a senator. In his memoirs, Biden notes that staffers were taking bets on how long he would last.[20][52] A single father for five years, Biden left standing orders that he be interrupted in the Senate at any time if his sons called.[46] In remembrance of his wife and daughter, Biden does not work on December 18, the anniversary of the accident.[53] Biden's elder son, Beau, became Delaware Attorney General and an Army Judge Advocate who served in Iraq;[54] his younger son, Hunter, became a Washington attorney and lobbyist.[55]
In 1975, Biden met Jill Tracy Jacobs, who grew up in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, and would become a teacher in Delaware.[56] They had met on a blind date with the help of Biden's brother, although it turned out that Biden had already noticed her picture in a local advertisement.[56] Biden would credit her with renewing his interest in both politics and life.[57] On June 17, 1977, Biden and Jacobs married at the Chapel at the United Nations in New York.[19] They have one daughter, Ashley Blazer (born 1981),[23] who became a social worker and staffer at the Delaware Department of Services for Children, Youth, and Their Families.[58] The Bidens are Roman Catholics and regularly attend Mass at St. Joseph on the Brandywine in Greenville, Delaware.[59]
During his first years in the Senate, Biden focused on legislation regarding consumer-protection and environmental issues and called for greater accountability on the part of government.[60] In mid-1974, freshman Senator Biden was named one of the 200 Faces for the Future by Time magazine, in a profile that mentioned what had happened to his family and characterized Biden as "self-confident" and "compulsively ambitious".[60]
Biden became ranking minority member of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary in 1981. In 1984, he was Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act; civil libertarians praised him for modifying some of the Act's provisions, and it was his most important legislative accomplishment at that point in time.[61] Biden first considered running for president in that year, after he gained notice for giving speeches to party audiences that simultaneously scolded and encouraged Democrats.[62]

Regarding foreign policy, during his first decade in the Senate, Biden focused on arms control issues.[63][64] In response to the refusal of the U.S. Congress to ratify the SALT II Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, Biden took the initiative to meet the Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, educated him about American concerns and interests, and secured several changes to address objections of the Foreign Relations Committee.[65] When the Reagan administration wanted to interpret the 1972 SALT I Treaty loosely in order to allow the Strategic Defense Initiative to proceed, Biden argued for strict adherence to the treaty's terms.[63] Biden clashed again with the Reagan administration in 1986 over economic sanctions against South Africa;[64] he received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State George P. Shultz at a Senate hearing because of the administration's support of that country, which continued to practice the apartheid system.[21]
Biden ran for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination, formally declaring his candidacy at the Wilmington train station on June 9, 1987.[66] He was attempting to become the youngest president since John F. Kennedy.[21] When the campaign began, Biden was considered a potentially strong candidate because of his moderate image, his speaking ability on the stump, his appeal to Baby Boomers, his high profile position as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the upcoming Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination hearings, and his fundraising appeal.[67][68] He raised $1.7 million in the first quarter of 1987, more than any other candidate.[67][68]
By August 1987, Biden's campaign, whose messaging was confused due to staff rivalries,[69] had begun to lag behind those of Michael Dukakis and Dick Gephardt,[67] although he had still raised more funds than all candidates but Dukakis, and was seeing an upturn in Iowa polls.[68][70] In September 1987, the campaign ran into trouble when he was accused of plagiarizing a speech that had been made earlier that year by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour Party.[71] Kinnock's speech included the lines:
"Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university? [Then pointing to his wife in the audience] Why is Glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university? Was it because all our predecessors were thick?"
"I started thinking as I was coming over here, why is it that Joe Biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university? [Then pointing to his wife in the audience] Why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college? Is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright? Is it because I'm the first Biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree that I was smarter than the rest?"
Biden had in fact cited Kinnock as the source for the formulation on previous occasions.[72][73] But he made no reference to the original source at the August 23 Democratic debate at the Iowa State Fair being reported on,[74] nor in an August 26 interview for the National Education Association.[73] Moreover, while political speeches often appropriate ideas and language from each other, Biden's use came under more scrutiny because he fabricated aspects of his own family's background in order to match Kinnock's.[13][75] Biden was soon found to have earlier that year lifted passages from a 1967 speech by Robert F. Kennedy (for which Biden aides took the blame) and a short phrase from the 1961 inaugural address of John F. Kennedy, and in two prior years to have done the same with a 1976 passage from Hubert H. Humphrey.[76]
A few days later, Biden's plagiarism incident in law school came to public light.[26] Video was also released showing that when earlier questioned by a New Hampshire resident about his grades in law school, Biden had stated that he had graduated in the "top half" of his class, that he had attended law school on a full scholarship, and that he had received three degrees in college,[25][77] each of which were untrue or exaggerations of his actual record.[25]
The Kinnock and school revelations were magnified by the limited amount of other news about the nomination race at the time,[78] when most of the public were not yet paying attention to any of the campaigns; Biden thus fell into what The Washington Post writer Paul Taylor described as that year's trend, a "trial by media ordeal".[79] Biden lacked a strong demographic or political group of support to help him survive the crisis.[70][80] He withdrew from the nomination race on September 23, 1987, saying his candidacy had been overrun by "the exaggerated shadow" of his past mistakes.[81]
After Biden withdrew from the race, it was revealed that the Dukakis campaign had secretly made a video highlighting the Biden–Kinnock comparison and distributed it to news outlets.[82] Later in 1987, the Delaware Supreme Court's Board of Professional Responsibility cleared Biden of the law school plagiarism charges regarding his standing as a lawyer, saying Biden had "not violated any rules".[83]
In February 1988, after suffering from several episodes of increasingly severe neck pain, Biden was taken by long-distance ambulance to Walter Reed Army Medical Center and given lifesaving surgery to correct an intracranial berry aneurysm that had begun leaking;[84][85] the situation was serious enough that a priest had administered last rites at the hospital.[86] While recuperating, he suffered a pulmonary embolism, which represented a major complication.[85] Another operation to repair a second aneurysm, which had caused no symptoms but was also at risk from bursting, was performed in May 1988.[85][87] The hospitalization and recovery kept Biden from his duties in the U.S. Senate for seven months.[53] Biden has had no recurrences or effects from the aneurysms since then.[85] In retrospect, Biden's family came to believe that the early end to his presidential campaign had been a blessing in disguise, for had he still been campaigning in the midst of the primaries in early 1988, he might well have not have stopped to seek medical attention and the condition might have become unsurvivable.[88]
Biden was a long-time member of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, which he chaired from 1987 until 1995 and on which he served as ranking minority member from 1981 until 1987 and again from 1995 until 1997. In this capacity, he dealt with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties.
While chairman, Biden presided over the two most contentious U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings in history, those for Robert Bork in 1987 and Clarence Thomas in 1991.[13] In the Bork hearings, Biden stated his opposition to Bork soon after the nomination, reversing an approval in an interview of a hypothetical Bork nomination he had made the previous year and angering conservatives who thought he could not conduct the hearings dispassionately.[89] At the close, Biden won praise for conducting the proceedings fairly and with good humor and courage, as his 1988 presidential campaign collapsed in the middle of the hearings.[89][90] Rejecting some of the less intellectually honest arguments that other Bork opponents were making,[13] Biden framed his discussion around the belief that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy that extend beyond those explicitly enumerated in the text, and that Bork's strong originalism was ideologically incompatible with that view.[90] Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 9–5 vote,[90] and then rejected in the full Senate by a 58–42 margin.
In the Thomas hearings, Biden's questions on constitutional issues were often long and convoluted, sometimes such that Thomas forgot the question being asked.[91] Viewers of the high-profile hearings were often annoyed by Biden's style.[92] Thomas later wrote that despite earlier private assurances from the senator, Biden's questions had been akin to a beanball.[93] The nomination came out of the committee without a recommendation, with Biden opposed.[13] In part due to his own bad experiences in 1987 with his presidential campaign, Biden was reluctant to let personal matters enter into the hearings.[91] Biden initially shared with committee, but not the public, Anita Hill's sexual harassment charges, on the grounds she was not yet willing to testify.[13] After she did, Biden did not permit other witnesses to testify further on her behalf, such as Angela Wright (who made a similar charge) and experts on harassment.[94] Biden said he was striving to preserve Thomas's right to privacy and the decency of the hearings.[91][94] The nomination was approved by a 52–48 vote in the full Senate, with Biden again opposed.[13] During and afterwards, Biden was strongly criticized by liberal legal groups and women's groups for having mishandled the hearings and having not done enough to support Hill.[94] Biden subsequently sought out women to serve on the Judiciary Committee and emphasized women's issues in the committee's legislative agenda.[13]
Biden was involved in crafting many federal crime laws. He spearheaded the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, also known as the Biden Crime Law, which included the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which expired in 2004 after its ten-year sunset period and was not renewed.[95][96] It also included the landmark Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which contains a broad array of measures to combat domestic violence and provides billions of dollars in federal funds to address gender-based crimes. In 2000, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Morrison that the section of VAWA allowing a federal civil remedy for victims of gender-motivated violence exceeded Congress's authority and therefore was unconstitutional.[97] Congress reauthorized VAWA in 2000 and 2005.[98] Biden has said, "I consider the Violence Against Women Act the single most significant legislation that I've crafted during my 35-year tenure in the Senate."[99] In 2004 and 2005, Biden enlisted major American technology companies in diagnosing the problems of the Austin, Texas-based National Domestic Violence Hotline, and to donate equipment and expertise to it in a successful effort to improve its services.[100][101]
Biden was critical of the actions of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr during the 1990s Whitewater controversy and Lewinsky scandal investigations, and said "it's going to be a cold day in hell" before another Independent Counsel is granted the same powers.[102] Biden voted to acquit on both charges during the impeachment of President Clinton.
As chairman of the International Narcotics Control Caucus, Biden wrote the laws that created the U.S. "Drug Czar", who oversees and coordinates national drug control policy. In April 2003, he introduced the controversial Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act, also known as the RAVE Act. He continued to work to stop the spread of "date rape drugs" such as flunitrazepam, and drugs such as Ecstasy and Ketamine. In 2004, he worked to pass a bill outlawing steroids like androstenedione, the drug used by many baseball players.[13]
Biden's legislation to promote college aid and loan programs allows families to deduct on their annual income tax returns up to $10,000 per year in higher education expenses. His "Kids 2000" legislation established a public/private partnership to provide computer centers, teachers, Internet access, and technical training to young people, particularly to low-income and at-risk youth.[103]
Biden was also a long-time member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. In 1997, he became the ranking minority member and chaired the committee in January 2001 and from June 2001 through 2003. When Democrats re-took control of the Senate following the 2006 elections, Biden again assumed the top spot on the committee in 2007.[104] Biden was generally a liberal internationalist in foreign policy.[63][105] He collaborated effectively with important Republican Senate figures such as Richard Lugar and Jesse Helms and sometimes went against elements of his own party.[104][105] Biden was also co-chair of the NATO Observer Group in the Senate.[106] A partial list covering this time showed Biden meeting with some 150 leaders from nearly 60 countries and international organizations.[107] Biden held frequent hearings as chair of the committee, as well as holding many subcommittee hearings during the three times he chaired the Subcommittee on European Affairs.[63]
Biden became interested in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991.[63] Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden was among the first to call for the "lift and strike" policy of lifting the arms embargo, training Bosnian Muslims and supporting them with NATO air strikes, and investigating war crimes.[63][104] Both the George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement.[63][105] In April 1993, Biden spent a week in the Balkans and held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević.[108] Biden related that he told Milošević, "I think you're a damn war criminal and you should be tried as one."[108] Biden wrote an amendment in 1992 to compel the Bush administration to arm the Bosnians, but deferred in 1994 to a somewhat softer stance preferred by the Clinton administration, before signing on the following year to a stronger measure sponsored by Bob Dole and Joe Lieberman.[108] The 1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina then led to the Dayton Agreement and a successful NATO peacekeeping effort.[63] Biden has called his role in affecting Balkans policy in the mid-1990s his "proudest moment in public life" that related to foreign policy.[105] In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Biden supported the NATO bombing campaign against Serbia and Montenegro,[63] and co-sponsored with his friend John McCain the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on President Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milosevic over Serbian actions in Kosovo.[105][109] In 1998, Congressional Quarterly named Biden one of "Twelve Who Made a Difference" for playing a lead role in several foreign policy matters, including NATO enlargement and the successful passage of bills to streamline foreign affairs agencies and punish religious persecution overseas.[110]
Biden had voted against authorization for the Gulf War in 1991,[105] siding with 45 of the 55 Democratic senators; he said the U.S. was bearing almost all the burden in the anti-Iraq coalition.[111] Biden was a strong supporter of the 2001 war in Afghanistan, saying "Whatever it takes, we should do it."[112] Regarding Iraq, Biden stated in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security, and that there was no option but to eliminate that threat.[113] The Bush administration rejected an effort Biden undertook with Senator Richard Lugar to pass a resolution authorizing military action only after the exhaustion of diplomatic efforts. In October 2002, Biden voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, justifying the Iraq War.[105] While he soon became a critic of the war and viewed his vote as a "mistake", he did not push to require a U.S. withdrawal.[105][108] He supported the appropriations to pay for the occupation, but argued repeatedly that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should "level with the American people" about the cost and length of the conflict.[104][109]
By late 2006, Biden's stance had shifted, and he opposed the troop surge of 2007,[105][108] saying General David Petraeus was "dead, flat wrong" in believing the surge could work.[112] Biden was instead a leading advocate for dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states.[114] In November 2006, Biden and Leslie H. Gelb, President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, released a comprehensive strategy to end sectarian violence in Iraq.[115] Rather than continuing the present approach or withdrawing, the plan called for "a third way": federalizing Iraq and giving Kurds, Shiites, and Sunnis "breathing room" in their own regions.[116] In September 2007, a non-binding resolution passed the Senate endorsing such a scheme.[115] However, the idea was unfamiliar, had no political constituency, and failed to gain traction.[112] Iraq's political leadership united in denouncing the resolution as a de facto partitioning of the country, and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad issued a statement distancing itself.[115]
In March 2004, Biden secured the brief release of Libyan democracy activist and political prisoner Fathi Eljahmi, after meeting with leader Muammar Gaddafi in Tripoli.[117][118] In May 2008, Biden sharply criticized President George W. Bush for his speech to Israel's Knesset in which he suggested that some Democrats were acting in the same way some Western leaders did when they appeased Hitler in the runup to World War II. Biden stated: "This is bullshit. This is malarkey. This is outrageous. Outrageous for the president of the United States to go to a foreign country, sit in the Knesset ... and make this kind of ridiculous statement." Biden later apologized for using the expletive. Biden further stated, "Since when does this administration think that if you sit down, you have to eliminate the word 'no' from your vocabulary?"[119]
Biden was a familiar figure to his Delaware constituency, by virtue of his daily train commuting from there,[13] and generally sought to attend to state needs.[120] Biden was a strong supporter of increased Amtrak funding and rail security;[120] he hosted barbecues and an annual Christmas dinner for the Amtrak crews, and they would sometimes hold the last train of the night a few minutes so he could catch it.[36][120] He earned the nickname "Amtrak Joe" as a result (and in 2011, Amtrak's Wilmington Station was named the Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Railroad Station, in honor of the over 7,000 trips he made from there).[121][122] He was an advocate for Delaware military installations, including Dover Air Force Base and New Castle Air National Guard Base.[123]
In 1975, Biden broke from liberal orthodoxy when he took legislative action to limit desegregation busing.[61] In doing so, he said busing was a "bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense," and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.[61] Three years later, Wilmington's federally mandated cross-district busing plan generated much turmoil, and in trying to legislate a compromise solution, Biden found himself alienating both black and white voters for a while.[124]
Since 1991, Biden has served as an adjunct professor at the Widener University School of Law, Delaware's only law school, where he has taught a seminar on constitutional law.[125][126] The seminar has been one of Widener's most popular, often with a waiting list for enrollment.[126] Biden has typically co-taught the course with another professor, taking on at least half the course minutes and sometimes flying back from overseas to make one of the classes.[127][128]

Biden was a sponsor of bankruptcy legislation during the 2000s, which was sought by MBNA, one of Delaware's largest companies, and other credit card issuers.[13] Biden fought for certain amendments to the bill that would indirectly protect homeowners and forbid anti-abortion felons from using bankruptcy to discharge fines; the overall bill was vetoed by Bill Clinton in 2000 but then finally passed as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act in 2005, with Biden supporting.[13] The downstate Sussex County region is the nation's top chicken-producing area, and Biden held up trade agreements with Russia when that country stopped importing U.S. chickens.[120]
In 2007, Biden requested and gained $67 million worth of projects for his constituents through congressional earmarks.[129]

Following his initial election in 1972, Biden was re-elected to six additional terms, in the elections of 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008, usually getting about 60 percent of the vote.[120] He did not face strong opposition; Pete du Pont, then a governor, chose not to run against him in 1984.[61] Biden spent 28 years as a junior senator due to the two-year seniority of his Republican colleague William V. Roth, Jr. After Roth was defeated for re-election by Tom Carper in 2000, Biden became Delaware's senior senator. He then became the longest-serving senator in Delaware history.[131] In May 1999, Biden set the mark for youngest senator to cast 10,000 votes.[110]
With a net worth between $59,000 and $366,000, and almost no outside income or investment income, Biden was consistently ranked as one of the least wealthy members of the Senate.[132][133][134] Biden stated that he was listed as the second poorest member in Congress, a distinction that he was not proud of, but attributed to being elected early in his career.[135] Biden realized early in his senatorial career how vulnerable poorer public officials are to offers of financial contributions in exchange for policy support, and he pushed campaign finance reform measures during his first term.[61]
During his years as a senator, Biden amassed a reputation for loquaciousness,[136][137][138] with his questions and remarks during Senate hearings being especially known for being long-winded.[139][140] He has been a strong speaker and debater and a frequent and effective guest on the Sunday morning talk shows.[140] In public appearances, he is known to deviate from prepared remarks at will.[141] According to political analyst Mark Halperin, he has shown "a persistent tendency to say silly, offensive, and off-putting things";[140] The New York Times writes that Biden's "weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything".[138] Nor is Biden known for modesty; journalist James Traub has written that "Biden's vanity and his regard for his own gifts seem considerable even by the rarefied standards of the U.S. Senate."[112]
Political writer Howard Fineman has said that, "Biden is not an academic, he's not a theoretical thinker, he's a great street pol. He comes from a long line of working people in Scranton—auto salesmen, car dealers, people who know how to make a sale. He has that great Irish gift."[36] Political columnist David S. Broder has viewed Biden as having grown since he came to Washington and since his failed 1988 presidential bid: "He responds to real people—that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much much better."[36] Traub concludes that "Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself."[112]
Biden had thought about running for president again ever since his failed 1988 bid.[nb 2] Biden declared his candidacy for president on January 31, 2007, although he had discussed running for months prior,[144] and first made a formal announcement to Tim Russert on Meet the Press on January 7, stating he would "be the best Biden I can be."[145] In January 2006, Delaware newspaper columnist Harry F. Themal wrote that Biden "occupies the sensible center of the Democratic Party."[146] Themal concludes that this is the position Biden desires, and that in a campaign "he plans to stress the dangers to the security of the average American, not just from the terrorist threat, but from the lack of health assistance, crime, and energy dependence on unstable parts of the world."[146]
During his campaign, Biden focused on the war in Iraq and his support for the implementation of the Biden-Gelb plan to achieve political success. He touted his record in the Senate as the head of major congressional committees and his experience on foreign policy. Despite speculation to the contrary,[147] Biden rejected the notion of accepting the position of Secretary of State, focusing only on the presidency. At a 2007 campaign event, Biden said, "I know a lot of my opponents out there say I'd be a great Secretary of State. Seriously, every one of them. Do you watch any of the debates? 'Joe's right, Joe's right, Joe's right.'"[148] Other candidates' comments that "Joe is right" in the Democratic debates were converted into a Biden campaign theme and ad.[149] In mid-2007, Biden stressed his foreign policy expertise compared to Obama's, saying of the latter, "I think he can be ready, but right now I don't believe he is. The presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training."[150] Biden also said that Obama was copying some of his foreign policy ideas.[112] Biden was noted for his one-liners on the campaign trail, saying of Republican then-frontrunner Rudy Giuliani at the October 30, 2007, debate in Philadelphia, "There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11."[151] Overall, Biden's debate performances were an effective mixture of humor and sharp and surprisingly disciplined comments.[152]
Biden made remarks during the campaign that attracted controversy. On the day of his January 2007 announcement, he spoke of fellow Democratic candidate and Senator Barack Obama: "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, I mean, that's a storybook, man."[153][nb 3] This comment undermined his campaign as soon as it began and significantly damaged his fund-raising capabilities;[152] it later took second place on Time magazine's list of Top 10 Campaign Gaffes for 2007.[155] Biden had earlier been criticized in July 2006 for a remark he made about his support among Indian Americans: "I've had a great relationship. In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian-Americans moving from India. You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking."[156] Biden later said the remark was not intended to be derogatory.[156][nb 4]
Overall, Biden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton;[158] he never rose above single digits in the national polls of the Democratic candidates. In the initial contest on January 3, 2008, Biden placed fifth in the Iowa caucuses, garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates.[159] Biden withdrew from the race that evening, saying "There is nothing sad about tonight.... I feel no regret."[160]
Despite the lack of success, Biden's stature in the political world rose as the result of his campaign.[152] In particular, it changed the relationship between Biden and Obama. Although the two had served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they had not been close, with Biden having resented Obama's quick rise to political stardom,[112][161] and Obama having viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing.[162] Now, having gotten to know each other during 2007, Obama appreciated Biden's campaigning style and appeal to working class voters, and Biden was convinced that Obama was "the real deal".[161][162]

Since shortly following Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race, Obama had been privately telling Biden that he was interested in finding an important place for him in a possible Obama administration.[163] Biden declined Obama's first request to vet him for the vice presidential slot, fearing the vice presidency would represent a loss in status and voice from his senate position, but subsequently changed his mind.[112][164] In a June 22, 2008, interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Biden confirmed that, although he was not actively seeking a spot on the ticket, he would accept the vice presidential nomination if offered.[165] In early August, Obama and Biden met in secret to discuss a possible vice-presidential relationship,[163] and the two hit it off well personally.[161] On August 22, 2008, Barack Obama announced that Biden would be his running mate.[166][167] The New York Times reported that the strategy behind the choice reflected a desire to fill out the ticket with someone who has foreign policy and national security experience—and not to help the ticket win a swing state or to emphasize Obama's "change" message.[168] Other observers pointed out Biden's appeal to middle class and blue-collar voters, as well as his willingness to aggressively challenge Republican nominee John McCain in a way that Obama seemed uncomfortable doing at times.[169][170] In accepting Obama's offer, Biden ruled out to him the possibility of running for president again in 2016[163] (although comments by Biden in subsequent years seemed to back off that stance, with Biden not wanting to diminish his political power by appearing uninterested in advancement).[171][172][173] Biden was officially nominated for vice president on August 27 by voice vote at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.[174]

After his selection as a vice presidential candidate, Biden was criticized by his own Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington Bishop Michael Saltarelli over his stance on abortion, which goes against the church's pro-life beliefs and teachings.[175] The diocese confirmed that even if elected vice president, Biden would not be allowed to speak at Catholic schools.[176] Biden was soon barred from receiving Holy Communion by the bishop of his original hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, because of his support for abortion rights;[177] however, Biden did continue to receive Communion at his local Delaware parish.[176] Scranton became a flash point in the competition for swing state Catholic voters between the Democratic campaign and liberal Catholic groups, who stressed that other social issues should be considered as much or more than abortion, and many bishops and conservative Catholics, who maintained abortion was paramount.[178] Biden said he believed that life began at conception but that he would not impose his personal religious views on others.[179] Bishop Saltarelli had previously stated regarding stances similar to Biden's: "No one today would accept this statement from any public servant: 'I am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena.' Likewise, none of us should accept this statement from any public servant: 'I am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena.'"[176]
Biden's vice presidential campaigning gained little media visibility, as far greater press attention was focused on the Republican running mate, Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin.[138][180] During one week in September 2008, for instance, the Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism found that Biden was only included in five percent of the news coverage of the race, far less than for the other three candidates on the tickets.[181] Biden nevertheless focused on campaigning in economically challenged areas of swing states and trying to win over blue-collar Democrats, especially those who had supported Hillary Rodham Clinton.[112][138] Biden attacked McCain heavily, despite a long-standing personal friendship;[nb 5] he would say, "That guy I used to know, he's gone. It literally saddens me."[138] As the financial crisis of 2007–2010 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008 and the proposed bailout of United States financial system became a major factor in the campaign, Biden voted in favor of the $700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which passed the Senate 74–25.[183]
Biden is nominated as the Democratic vice presidential candidate during the third night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.
On October 2, 2008, Biden participated in the campaign's one vice presidential debate with Palin. Post-debate polls found that while Palin exceeded many voters' expectations, Biden had won the debate overall.[184] On October 5, Biden suspended campaign events for a few days after the death of his mother-in-law.[185] During the final days of the campaign, Biden focused on less-populated, older, less well-off areas of battleground states, especially in Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, where polling indicated he was popular and where Obama had not campaigned or performed well in the Democratic primaries.[186][187][188] He also campaigned in some normally Republican states, as well as in areas with large Catholic populations.[188]
Under instructions from the Obama campaign, Biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid off-hand remarks, such as one about Obama being tested by a foreign power soon after taking office, which had attracted negative attention.[186][187] Privately, Obama was frustrated by Biden's remarks, saying "How many times is Biden gonna say something stupid?"[189] Obama campaign staffers referred to Biden blunders as "Joe bombs" and kept Biden uninformed about strategy discussions, which in turn irked Biden.[173] Relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month, until Biden apologized on a call to Obama and the two built a stronger partnership.[189] Publicly, Obama strategist David Axelrod said that any unexpected comments had been outweighed by Biden's high popularity ratings.[190] Nationally, Biden had a 60 percent favorability rating in a Pew Research Center poll, compared to Palin's 44 percent.[186]

On November 4, 2008, Obama was elected President and Biden Vice President of the United States.[191] The Obama-Biden ticket won 365 Electoral College votes to McCain-Palin's 173,[192] and had a 53–46 percent edge in the nationwide popular vote.[193]
Biden had continued to run for his Senate seat as well as for Vice President,[194] as permitted by Delaware law.[120][nb 6] On November 4, Biden was also re-elected as senator, defeating Republican Christine O'Donnell.[195] Having won both races, Biden made a point of holding off his resignation from the Senate so that he could be sworn in for his seventh term on January 6, 2009.[196] He became the youngest senator ever to start a seventh full term, and said, "In all my life, the greatest honor bestowed upon me has been serving the people of Delaware as their United States senator."[196] Biden cast his last Senate vote on January 15, supporting the release of the second $350 billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program.[197] Biden resigned from the Senate later that day;[nb 7] in emotional farewell remarks on the Senate floor, where he had spent most of his adult life, Biden said, "Every good thing I have seen happen here, every bold step taken in the 36-plus years I have been here, came not from the application of pressure by interest groups, but through the maturation of personal relationships."[201]
As Biden headed to Delaware's Return Day tradition following the November 2008 election, and the transition process to an Obama administration began, Biden said he was in daily meetings with Obama and that McCain was still his friend.[202] The U.S. Secret Service codename given to Biden is "Celtic", referencing his Irish roots.[203]
Biden chose veteran Democratic lawyer and aide Ron Klain to be his vice-presidential chief of staff,[204] and Time Washington bureau chief Jay Carney to be his director of communications.[205] Biden intended to eliminate some of the explicit roles assumed by the vice presidency of his predecessor, Dick Cheney,[206] who had established himself as an autonomous power center.[112] Otherwise, Biden said he would not model his vice presidency on any of the ones before him, but instead would seek to provide advice and counsel on every critical decision Obama would make.[207] Biden said he had been closely involved in all the cabinet appointments that were made during the transition.[207] Biden was also named to head the new White House Task Force on Working Families, an initiative aimed at improving the economic well being of the middle class.[208] As his last act as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Biden went on a trip to Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan during the second week of January 2009, meeting with the leadership of those countries.[209]
Biden became the 47th Vice President of the United States on January 20, 2009, when he was inaugurated alongside President Barack Obama. Biden is the first United States Vice President from Delaware[210] and the first Roman Catholic to attain that office.[211] Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens administered the oath of office to Biden.[212]
In the early months of the Obama administration, Biden assumed the role of an important behind-the-scenes counselor.[213] One role was to adjudicate disputes between Obama's "team of rivals".[112] The president compared Biden's efforts to a basketball player "who does a bunch of things that don't show up in the stat sheet."[213] Biden played a key role in gaining Senate support for several major pieces of Obama legislation, and was a main factor in convincing Senator Arlen Specter to switch from the Republican to the Democratic party.[214] Biden lost an internal debate to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton regarding his opposition to sending 21,000 new troops to the war in Afghanistan.[215][216] His skeptical voice was still considered valuable within the administration,[164] however, and later in 2009 Biden's views achieved more prominence within the White House as Obama reconsidered his Afghanistan strategy.[217] Biden made visits to Iraq about once every two months,[112] including trips to Baghdad in August and September 2009 to listen to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and reiterate U.S. stances on Iraq's future;[218] by this time he had become the administration's point man in delivering messages to Iraqi leadership about expected progress in the country.[164] Biden's January 2010 visit to Iraq in the midst of turmoil over banned candidates from the upcoming Iraqi parliamentary election resulted in 59 of the several hundred candidates being reinstated by the Iraqi government two days later.[219] (By 2012, Biden had made eight trips there.[220]) Biden was in charge of the oversight role for infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package intended to help counteract the ongoing recession, and stressed that only worthy projects should get funding.[221] He talked with hundreds of governors, mayors, and other local officials in this role.[220] During this period, Biden was satisfied that no major instances of waste or corruption had occurred[164] (and when he gave up the role in February 2011, he said that the number of fraud incidents with stimulus monies had been less than one percent).[222]
It took some time for the cautious Obama and the blunt, rambling Biden to work out ways of dealing with each other.[173] In late April 2009, Biden's off-message response to a question during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak, that he would advise family members against travelling on airplanes or subways, led to a swift retraction from the White House.[223] The remark revived Biden's reputation for gaffes,[224] and led to a spate of late-night television jokes themed on him being a loose-talking buffoon.[217][225][226] In the face of persistently rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had "misread how bad the economy was" but maintained confidence that the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up.[227] The same month, Secretary of State Clinton quickly disavowed Biden's remarks disparaging Russia as a power, but despite any missteps, Biden still retained Obama's confidence and was increasingly influential within the administration.[228] On March 23, 2010, a microphone picked up Biden telling the president that his signing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was "a big fucking deal" during live national news telecasts. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs replied via Twitter "And yes Mr. Vice President, you're right..."[229] Senior Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett said that Biden's loose talk "[is] part of what makes the vice president so endearing ... We wouldn't change him one bit."[228] Former Senate colleague Lindsey Graham said, "If there were no gaffes, there'd be no Joe. He's someone you can't help but like."[217] Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama's daughter Sasha and Biden's granddaughter Maisy, who attended Sidwell Friends School together.[173]
Situation Room: Biden, Obama and the U.S. national security team gathered in the White House Situation Room to monitor the progress of the May 2011 U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden. Biden opposed going forward with the raid at that time,[220] but took the lead in notifying Congressional leaders of the successful outcome.[230]
Biden's most important role within the administration has been to question assumptions and playing a contrarian role.[112][217] Obama said that, "The best thing about Joe is that when we get everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, to look at things from every angle, and that is very valuable for me."[164] Another senior Obama advisor said Biden "is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are as intellectually honest as possible."[164] On June 11, 2010, Biden represented the United States at the opening ceremony of the World Cup, attended the England v. U.S. game which was tied 1–1, and visited Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa.[231] Throughout, Joe and Jill Biden maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their official residence in Washington, often entertaining some of their grandchildren, and regularly returned to their home in Delaware.[232]
Biden campaigned heavily for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections, maintaining an attitude of optimism in the face of general predictions of large-scale losses for the party.[233] Following large-scale Republican gains in the elections and the departure of White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, Biden's past relationships with Republicans in Congress became more important.[234][235] He led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the New START treaty.[234][235] In December 2010, Biden's advocacy within the White House for a middle ground, followed by his direct negotiations with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, were instrumental in producing the administration's compromise tax package that revolved around a temporary extension of the Bush tax cuts.[235][236] Biden then took the lead in trying to sell the agreement to a reluctant Democratic caucus in Congress,[235][237] which was passed as the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010.
Biden shook hands with President Obama immediately after a call to House Speaker John Boehner concluded the debt ceiling deal that led to the Budget Control Act of 2011. Biden played a key role in forging the deal.[238]
In March 2011, Obama detailed Biden to lead negotiations between both houses of Congress and the White House in resolving federal spending levels for the rest of the year and avoid a government shutdown.[239] By May 2011, a "Biden panel" with six congressional members was trying to reach a bipartisan deal on raising the U.S. debt ceiling as part of an overall deficit reduction plan.[240][241] The U.S. debt ceiling crisis developed over the next couple of months, but it was again Biden's relationship with McConnell that proved to be a key factor in breaking a deadlock and finally bringing about a bipartisan deal to resolve it, in the form of the Budget Control Act of 2011, signed on August 2, 2011, the same day that an unprecedented U.S. default had loomed.[238][242][243] Biden had spent the most time bargaining with Congress on the debt question of anyone in the administration,[242] and one Republican staffer said, "Biden's the only guy with real negotiating authority, and [McConnell] knows that his word is good. He was a key to the deal."[238]
In October 2010, Biden stated that Obama had asked him to remain as his running mate for the 2012 presidential election.[233] With Obama's popularity on the decline, however, in late 2011 White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley conducted some secret polling and focus group research into the idea of Secretary of State Clinton replacing Biden on the ticket.[244] The notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama,[244] and White House officials later said that Obama had never entertained the idea.[245]
Biden's May 2012 statement that he was "absolutely comfortable" with same-sex marriage gained considerable public attention in comparison to President Obama's position, which had been described as "evolving".[246] Biden made his statement without administration consent, and Obama and his aides were quite irked, since Obama had planned to shift position several months later, in the build-up to the party convention, and since Biden had previously counseled the president to avoid the issue lest key Catholic voters be offended.[173][247][248][249] Gay rights advocates seized upon the Biden stance,[247] and within days, Obama announced that he too supported same-sex marriage, an action in part forced by Biden's unexpected remarks.[250] Biden apologized to Obama in private for having spoken out,[248][251] while Obama acknowledged publicly it had been done from the heart.[247] The incident showed that Biden still struggled at times with message discipline;[173] as Time wrote, "everyone knows [that] Biden's greatest strength is also his greatest weakness."[220] Relations were also strained between the campaigns when Biden appeared to use his to bolster fundraising contacts for a possible run on his own in the United States presidential election, 2016, and the vice president ended up being excluded from Obama campaign strategy meetings.[244]
The Obama campaign nevertheless still valued Biden as a retail-level politician who could connect with disaffected, blue collar workers and rural residents, and he had a heavy schedule of appearances in swing states as the Obama re-election campaign began in earnest in spring 2012.[92][220] An August 2012 remark before a mixed-race audience that proposed Republican relaxation of Wall Street regulations would "put y'all back in chains" led to a similar analysis of Biden's face-to-face campaigning abilities versus tendency to go off track.[92][252][253] The Los Angeles Times wrote, "Most candidates give the same stump speech over and over, putting reporters if not the audience to sleep. But during any Biden speech, there might be a dozen moments to make press handlers cringe, and prompt reporters to turn to each other with amusement and confusion."[252] Time magazine wrote that Biden often goes too far and that "Along with the familiar Washington mix of neediness and overconfidence, Biden's brain is wired for more than the usual amount of goofiness."[92]
Biden was officially nominated for a second term as vice president on September 6 by voice vote at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina.[254] He faced his Republican counterpart, Representative Paul Ryan, in the lone 2012 vice presidential debate on October 11 in Danville, Kentucky. There he made a feisty, emotional defense of the Obama administration's record and energetically attacked the Republican ticket, in an effort to regain campaign momentum lost by Obama's unfocused debate performance against Republican nominee Mitt Romney the week before.[255][256]
On November 6, 2012, the president and vice president were elected to second terms.[257] The Obama-Biden ticket won 332 Electoral College votes to Romney-Ryan's 206 and had a 51–47 percent edge in the nationwide popular vote.[258]
In December 2012, Biden was named by Obama to head the Gun Violence Task Force, created to address the causes of gun violence in the United States in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[259] Later that month, during the final days before the country fell off the "fiscal cliff", Biden's relationship with McConnell once more proved important as the two negotiated a deal that led to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 being passed at the start of 2013.[260][261] It made permanent much of the Bush tax cuts but raised rates on upper income levels.[261]
Biden was inaugurated to a second term in the early morning of January 20, 2013, at a small ceremony in his official residence with Justice Sonia Sotomayor presiding (a public ceremony took place on January 21).[262] He continued to be in the forefront as the Obama administration put forth executive orders and proposed legislation towards new gun control measures[96] (the legislation failed to pass). Meanwhile, Biden prepared for a possible 2016 presidential candidacy, should he decide to run. With Hillary Rodham Clinton heavily favored should she decide to run, however, Biden faced the prospect of being the first sitting vice president to fail to win his party's nomination since Alben W. Barkley in 1952.[263][264]
During the discussions that led to the October 2013 passage of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, which resolved the U.S. federal government shutdown of 2013 and the U.S. debt-ceiling crisis of 2013, Biden played little role. This was due to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders cutting the vice president out of any direct talks with Congress, feeling that Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations.[265][266][267]
Biden has supported campaign finance reform including the McCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and banning contributions of issue ads and gifts;[274] capital punishment as his 1993 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act created several new capital offenses;[275] deficit spending on fiscal stimulus in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009;[276][277] tax credits for the working poor and students;[278] carbon emissions cap and trade;[279] the increased infrastructure spending proposed by the Obama administration;[277] mass transit, supporting Amtrak, bus, and subway subsidies for decades;[280] renewable energy subsidies;[279] same-sex marriage;[281] student loan forgiveness;[282] increased taxation of the wealthy;[283] and universal health care.[284] He opposes marijuana legalization[285] and prefers the reduced military spending proposed in the Obama Administration's fiscal year 2014 budget.[286][287]
A method that political scientists use for gauging ideology is to compare the annual ratings by the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) with the ratings by the American Conservative Union (ACU).[288] Biden has a lifetime liberal 72 percent score from the ADA through 2004, while the ACU awarded Biden a lifetime conservative rating of 13 percent through 2008.[289] Using another metric, Biden has a lifetime average liberal score of 77.5 percent, according to a National Journal analysis that places him ideologically among the center of Senate Democrats.[290] The Almanac of American Politics rates congressional votes as liberal or conservative on the political spectrum, in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005–2006, Biden's average ratings were as follows: the economic rating was 80 percent liberal and 13 percent conservative, the social rating was 78 percent liberal and 18 percent conservative, and the foreign rating was 71 percent liberal and 25 percent conservative.[291] This has not changed much over time; his liberal ratings in the mid-1980s were also in the 70–80 percent range.[61]
Various advocacy groups have given Biden scores or grades as to how well his votes align with the positions of each group. The American Civil Liberties Union gives him an 86 percent lifetime score, with a 91 percent score for the 110th Congress.[292] Biden opposes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and supports governmental funding to find new energy sources.[293] Biden believes action must be taken on global warming. He co-sponsored the Sense of the Senate resolution calling on the United States to be a part of the United Nations climate negotiations and the Boxer-Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate.[294] Biden cites high health care and energy costs as two major threats to the prosperity of American businesses, and believes that addressing these issues will improve American economic competitiveness. Biden was given an 85 percent lifetime approval rating from AFL-CIO,[269] and he voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).[295]
Biden has received honorary degrees from the University of Scranton (1976),[296] Saint Joseph's University (1981),[297] Widener University School of Law (2000),[126] Emerson College (2003),[298] his alma mater the University of Delaware (2004),[299] Suffolk University Law School (2005),[300] and his other alma mater Syracuse University (2009).[301]
Biden received the Chancellor Medal from his alma mater, Syracuse University, in 1980.[302] In 2005, he received the George Arents Pioneer Medal—Syracuse's highest alumni award[302]—"for excellence in public affairs."[303]
In 2008, Biden received the Best of Congress Award, for "improving the American quality of life through family-friendly work policies," from Working Mother magazine.[304] Also in 2008, Biden shared with fellow Senator Richard Lugar the Hilal-i-Pakistan award from the Government of Pakistan, "in recognition of their consistent support for Pakistan."[305] In 2009, Biden received The Golden Medal of Freedom award from Kosovo, that region's highest award, for his vocal support for their independence in the late 1990s.[306]
Biden is an inductee of the Delaware Volunteer Firemen's Association Hall of Fame.[307] He was named to the Little League Hall of Excellence in 2009.[308]

Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr., was born November 20, 1942, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the first of four siblings. In 1953, the Biden family moved from Pennsylvania to Claymont, Delaware. He graduated from the University of Delaware and Syracuse Law School and served on the New Castle County Council. Then, at age 29, he became one of the youngest people ever elected to the United States Senate.
Just weeks after the election, tragedy struck the Biden family, when Biden's wife, Neilia, and their 1-year old daughter, Naomi, were killed and their two young sons critically injured in an auto accident. Vice President Biden was sworn in to the U.S. Senate at his sons' hospital bedside and began commuting to Washington every day by train, a practice he maintained throughout his career in the Senate.
In 1977, Vice President Biden married Jill Jacobs. Jill Biden, who holds a Ph.D. in Education, has been an educator for over two decades and currently teaches at a DC-area community college. The Vice President has three children: Beau, Hunter, and Ashley. Beau serves as Delaware's Attorney General and recently returned home from Iraq where he served as a Captain in the 261st Signal Brigade of the Delaware National Guard. Ashley is a social worker and Hunter is an attorney. Vice President Biden has five grandchildren: Naomi, Finnegan, Roberta Mabel ("Maisy"), Natalie, and Robert Hunter.
As a Senator from Delaware for 36 years, Senator Biden established himself as a leader on some of our nation's most important domestic and international challenges. As Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee for 17 years, then-Senator Biden was widely recognized for his work on criminal justice issues including the landmark 1994 Crime Bill and the Violence Against Women Act. As Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee since 1997, then-Senator Biden played a pivotal role in shaping U.S. foreign policy. He has been at the forefront of issues and legislation related to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, post-Cold War Europe, the Middle East, and Southwest Asia.
Now, as the 47th Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden has continued his leadership on important issues facing the nation.  The Vice President was tasked with implementing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, helping to rebuild our economy and lay the foundation for a sustainable economic future.  As part of his continued efforts to raise the living standards of middle class Americans across the country, Vice President Biden has also focused on the issues of college affordability and American manufacturing growth, key priorities of the Administration.
Vice President Biden continues to draw on his foreign policy experience, advising the President on a multitude of international issues.  He helped secure the Senate’s approval of the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia, together with significant new funding to maintain our nuclear laboratories.  He played a lead role in ending the war in Iraq responsibly, traveling to the country eight times since being elected – most recently in December 2011 to mark the formal end of the war.
In addition, Vice President Biden has supported the Administration’s effort to reestablish leadership in the Asia Pacific, traveling to China, Japan, and Mongolia in August 2011 and completing an exchange of visits with China’s then-Vice President in February 2012, that country’s current leader.  He has represented our country in every region of the world, advancing our unprecedented support for Israel’s security, securing approval in Europe for the Administration’s more effective approach to missile defense, working with Latin American leaders to combat drug trafficking and international crime and building relations with key leaders in Africa.  He has traveled to more than two dozen countries, including Germany, Belgium, Chile, Costa Rica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, Lebanon, Georgia, Ukraine, Iraq, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic, Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Jordan, Spain, Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Finland, Russia, Moldova, Italy, China, Mongolia, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Greece, Mexico, Honduras, Brazil, Colombia, and Trinidad and Tobago.

It was a busy week at the White House. This week, we got hyped for next week's White House Science Fair; the Bidens traveled to Romania and Cyprus; the President took an unexpected walk over to the Department of the Interior; a new National Monument was designated; and the President talked baseball and tourism in Cooperstown. Check out what else you may have missed in this week's wrap up.
A number of recent actions have helped American business and commerce — and the American workers who will benefit from more American-made goods sold across the world. But there’s more Congress can do to modernize our entire transportation system.

Joe Biden was born in Pennsylvania and moved with his family to Delaware at age 10. He earned an undergraduate degree from the University of Delaware in 1965, then a law degree from Syracuse University in 1968. A political prodigy, he was only 29 when elected to the Senate in 1972. He was elected six times more: in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee beginning in 1975, Biden carved out a reputation as a brainy and talkative expert in international relations. He ran for president in the elections of 1988 and 2008, losing in the primaries both times. Barack Obama won the Democratic nomination in 2008 and then chose Biden as his running mate. They defeated Republican nominees John McCain and Sarah Palin in the general election. Biden also was re-elected to the Senate that year (Delaware law allowed him to run for both offices), but he gave up that seat to become vice president. Biden and Obama took office on 20 January 2009. They were re-elected for new four-year terms on November 6, 2012, defeating the Republican ticket of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.Extra credit: Joe Biden married the former Neilia Hunter in 1966. They had three children: Joseph R. Biden III (called "Beau," b. 1969), Hunter (b. 1970), and Naomi (b. 1971). Neilia and Naomi were killed in a car crash in 1972, just a month after Biden was elected to the Senate. He remarried in 1977, to schoolteacher Jill Jacobs (now Jill Biden). Their daughter Ashley was born in 1981... Beau Biden was elected attorney general of Delaware in 2006... Joe Biden's 1988 run for president was cut short in 1987 after he used portions of a speech from British Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock in a campaign speech, without attributing Kinnock.

=======================================================
Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born Nov. 20, 1942, in Scranton, Penn., the son of Joe and Jean Biden [source: Biography]. He was the oldest of four in an Irish-Catholic family. His father was a businessman of varying success. Biden Sr. worked as a car salesman, a sales representative for Amoco Oil, co-owner of a crop dusting company, an executive in a marine sealant manufacturing firm, a realtor, and a boiler cleaner for a heating company [source: Chapman].When Joe Biden was 10, his family moved to a suburb of Wilmington, Del., where he attended Archmere, a private Catholic school. He took a part-time job to help pay for the tuition. As a boy, Biden had a debilitating stutter. He stood before a mirror reciting a line from Ralph Waldo Emerson's "The American Scholar" over and over, watching the muscles in his face in order to learn how to control them [source: ABC News].He went on to attend the University of Delaware, struggling with grades at first and finally earning a bachelor's degree in 1965. The previous year, Biden had gone to the Bahamas for spring break, where he snuck into a hotel pool and met his future wife, Neilia Hunter [source: Time]. In 1966, the couple married and Biden went back to school. He obtained his law degree from Syracuse University in 1968 and practiced law in Delaware until he first entered the U.S. Senate in 1972 [source: Time, Biden].In 1969, Biden's first son, Joseph R. "Beau" Biden, was born. He was followed by Robert Hunter Biden in 1970 and Naomi Biden in 1971 [source: Biography]. Tragedy struck the Biden family in December 1972, when Neilia and the three Biden children were involved in an auto accident while out Christmas shopping. Neilia and Naomi were killed; Beau and Hunter were injured.Biden received the news while at his Senate office. He says he considered suicide after suffering such a profound loss [source: ABC News]. Ultimately, he chose to live. He raised his two sons as a single parent with the help of his family, including his sister who moved in with them. And he found love again; in 1977, he married Jill Jacobs. She has a Ph.D. in education and teaches at Delaware Technical Community College. Joe and Jill Biden have a third child, in addition to Hunter and Beau: a daughter named Ashley. They also have five grandchildren [source: Obama]. Beau Biden is the Delaware attorney general and a captain in the Delaware National Guard. Hunter Biden is an attorney and former lobbyist. Ashley Biden is a social worker [source: Obama].In addition to his career as a senator, Biden also teaches constitutional law at the University of Delaware. Despite becoming the vice-presidential nominee during the 2008 campaign, he still teaches the class. And on one occasion, he "took the red-eye out of Afghanistan to make this class," a spokesperson for the law school said [source: CBS News].During the 2008 campaign, Sen. Biden's prior medical history became a question about his ability to lead, should he become vice president. In 1988, he suffered a brain aneurysm that nearly killed him. He had dropped out of the presidential race a few months prior (more on that on next page), when he felt what he took to be a pinched nerve and a headache. After a visit to the doctor, he was taken to emergency cranial surgery. He developed a blood clot in his lungs during recovery and suffered a second aneurysm. Biden underwent a subsequent cranial surgery the following May [source: Time]. Sen. Biden said the experience changed him; he adopted the dichotomous outlook of throwing himself into his role of senator while not sweating the small stuff.

            "Today we begin in earnest the work of making sure that the world we leave our children is just a little bit better than the one we inhabit today." - President-elect Barack Obama
Joe Biden is a rare mix. A leader who has worked for decades in Washington, but has never lived there. An expert on foreign policy, whose heart and values are firmly rooted in the middle class. He has stared down dictators, and spoken for America's cops and firefighters. He is uniquely suited to serve as Barack Obama’s partner in the urgent mission to bring about the change America needs to put our country back on track.
Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., age 66, was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on November 20, 1942, to Joseph Sr. and Jean Biden, the oldest of four. In 1953, the Biden family moved from Pennsylvania to Claymont, Delaware. Biden attended parochial school at St. Helena’s School in Wilmington and the Archmere Academy in Claymont. Public service has always been an important part of Biden family life -- one of Joe's great grandfathers served as a Pennsylvania state senator.
After graduating from the University of Delaware in 1965 and from law school at Syracuse University in 1968, Biden moved back to the Wilmington area and set up his own law firm. He practiced law until 1972.
In 1970, Biden -- at age 27 -- ran for New Castle County Council and won in a Republican district. At age 29, he launched an improbable bid to unseat two-term Republican U.S. Sen. J. Caleb Boggs. With very little help from the state establishment, and with his sister as his campaign manager, Biden defeated Boggs by 3,162 votes.
Just weeks after the election, Biden's wife, Neilia, and their 1-year-old daughter, Naomi, were killed and their two young sons critically injured in an auto accident. Biden was sworn in at his sons' hospital bedside and began commuting to Washington every day by train, a practice he has maintained throughout his career in the Senate.
In 1977, Biden married Jill Jacobs. Jill Biden, who holds an Ed.D., has been an educator for over two decades in Delaware's schools. Currently she is a professor at Delaware Technical Community College.
Vice President-Elect Biden has three children: Beau, Hunter, and Ashley. Beau currently serves as Delaware's Attorney General -- and as a captain in the 261st Signal Brigade of the Delaware National Guard. Ashley is a social worker and Hunter is an attorney. Vice President-Elect Biden also has five grandchildren: Naomi, Finnegan, Roberta Mabel, Natalie, and Robert Hunter.
In 1988, Biden suffered a cranial aneurysm and nearly died. He recovered by early 1989 after two surgeries and has enjoyed good health since then.
In addition to serving as U.S. Senator, Biden has been an adjunct professor at the Widener University School of Law since 1991, where he teaches a seminar on constitutional law.
Biden became ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee in 1997 and served as chairman of the committee from 2001 to 2003 and from 2007 to the present. He served as chairman or ranking member of the Judiciary Committee for sixteen years. He is recognized as one of the nation's leading authorities on foreign policy, as well as one of its most influential voices on terrorism, drug policy, crime, and issues important to women. He has been a tireless advocate for working families and has reached across the aisle to work with Republicans on tackling some of the greatest challenges facing Americans.
Like Barack Obama, Biden has been an outspoken critic of George W. Bush's handling of the war in Iraq. 
Biden's leadership was instrumental in helping to bring stability and peace to the Balkans. In 1999, Biden wrote a resolution endorsing the air war in Kosovo that was passed by the Senate. 
In the late 1990s, Biden led the effort in the Senate to bring Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO and to pass the Chemical Weapons Treaty. 
Biden has been instrumental in crafting almost every major piece of crime legislation over the past two decades. His Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 put more than 100,000 police officers on America's streets and has been credited with bringing crime rates down to the lowest point in a generation.
In 1996, Biden authored legislation to create a national registry of sex offenders, which tracks people convicted of sex crimes involving violence or committed against minors.
Biden authored and passed the landmark Violence Against Women Act, the strongest legislation to date that criminalizes domestic violence and holds batterers accountable. 
Biden was a strong supporter of the Family and Medical Leave Act, cracked down on deadbeat dads, and has been a consistent champion for equal pay. 
Biden was one of the first to introduce legislation to address global warming and he co-sponsored the most aggressive pieces of climate change legislation in the U.S. Senate.
Biden is a champion on the issue of making college more affordable by using the tax code to reduce costs.
Biden was successful in passing a provision that prevents budget cuts to military facilities while the nation is at war, an effort that shored up one of his key priorities -- top-notch medical treatment for all veterans in a fully-funded VA health care system.
Vice President-Elect Biden has a proven record of bringing people together to get things done. From global warming to combating violence against women to confronting the challenges of the dangerous world in which we live, Joe Biden has fought every day over the course of his life in public service to improve the lives of middle class families.
The Transition Directory was developed to introduce members of the Transition and the incoming Administration to the Federal government resources available to them.

Joe Biden (1942-) became vice president of the United States after spending 36 years as a U.S. senator from Delaware. Democratic nominee Barack Obama selected him as a running mate for the 2008 election, and the pair entered office inJanuary 2009 following their defeat of Arizona Senator John McCain and Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. As vice president, Biden has focused largely on economic and foreign policy issues.
Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942, in the blue collar city of Scranton, Pennsylvania. At age 10 he moved with his family to the Wilmington, Delaware, area, where his father found work as a car salesman. The first offour siblings, Biden attended a series of Catholic schools, including the elite preparatory high school Archmere Academy. Though he excelled at sports, Biden received mediocre grades and struggled with a stutter. In 1965 he graduatedfrom the University of Delaware with a double major in history and political science, and three years later he earned a law degree from Syracuse University. Meanwhile, in 1966, Biden married Neilia Hunter, with whom he would have three children.
Did You Know? Joe Biden is both the first Catholic and the first Delawarean to serve as vice president of the United States.Upon finishing law school, Biden returned to the Wilmington area and worked as an attorney for the next four years. In 1970 he won his first election to the New Castle County Council. Then, two years later, at age 29 he pulled off a surprising upset of Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs in a race for the U.S. Senate. Tragedy struck, however, before he was sworn in as the fifth-youngest senator in U.S. history. That December, his wife and 13-month-old daughter were killed and his two sons were hospitalized when a tractor-trailer plowed into their station wagon. Rather than move to Washington, D.C., a devastated Biden decided to commute by train every day so that he could spend more time with his sons. Biden remarried in 1977 to schoolteacher Jill Jacobs, with whom he would have one more daughter.
Biden won reelection in 1978 and five times after that. Overall, he spent 36 years in the U.S. Senate, including eight years as chair of the Judiciary Committee and four years as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. Despite generally supporting civil rights, Biden opposed the forced busing of students to end de facto segregation. Later on, he presided over the contentious confirmation hearings of U.S. Supreme Court nominees Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. (Bork was ultimately rejected by the Senate while Thomas was narrowly approved.) Biden also worked to preserve Delaware’s favorable corporate climate,legislated against domestic violence and crafted an anti-crime bill that provided for 100,000 more cops on the nation’s streets, banned assault weapons and mandated tougher penalties for drug dealers. Known for his foreign policy work, the well-traveled senator purportedly called Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic a war criminal to his face during a 1993 visit to Belgrade. Nearly a decade later, Biden voted to authorize the use of force in Iraq. Nonetheless, he eventually became a critic of the way George W. Bush’s administration handled the conflict.
Having raised a solid amount of campaign cash, Biden launched his first presidential bid in June 1987 and took to paraphrasing British Labour politician Neil Kinnock on the campaign trail. But although he had appropriately credited Kinnock in prior speeches, he failed to do so during an appearance at the Iowa State Fair and even borrowed facts from Kinnock’s life, stating inaccurately, for example, that he was the first in his family to go to college and that his ancestors were coal miners. Soon after, reports surfaced that Biden had likewise allegedly lifted passages from Robert F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey, and he was caught on camera exaggerating his academic credentials. With hiscandidacy on the defensive, Biden withdrew that September to concentrate on the Bork hearings. He then collapsed the following February from a life-threatening brain aneurysm, underwent two surgeries and took a seven-month leave from the Senate.
Biden kicked off his second attempt at the White House 20 years later but dropped out after securing only 1 percent of the delegates in the Iowa Democratic caucuses. Despite his penchant for gaffes, Barack Obama tapped him to be his running rate after winning the Democratic nomination. In the November 2008 presidential elections, Obama and Biden bested their Republican opponents, John McCain and Sarah Palin, with 52.9 percent of the popular vote.
Since taking office in January 2009 as the 47th vice president of the United States, Biden has been charged with overseeing a $787 billion economic stimulus package, running a middle-class task force and reviving an arms reduction treaty with Russia. He has also played a strong advisory role with respect to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Favorite Quote:"History says, don't hope on this side of the grave.  But then, once in a lifetime the longed for tidal wave of justice can rise up, and hope and history rhyme.  So hope for a great sea-change on the far side of revenge.  Believe that a further shore is reachable from here. Believe in miracles and cures and healing wells."- Seamus Heaney's "The Cure at Troy", "I look forward to a great future for America, a future in which our country will match its military strength with our moral restraint, its wealth with our wisdom, its power with our purpose. . . . And I look forward to an America which commands respect throughout the world not only for its strength but for its civilization as well."- John F. Kennedy, 1963.
