Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (German: [ˈjoːhan ˈvɔlfɡaŋ fɔn ˈɡøːtə] ( listen), 28 August 1749 – 22 March 1832) was a German writer and statesman. His body of work includes epic and lyric poetry written in a variety of metres and styles; prose and verse dramas; memoirs; an autobiography; literary and aesthetic criticism; treatises on botany, anatomy, and colour; and four novels. In addition, numerous literary and scientific fragments, more than 10,000 letters, and nearly 3,000 drawings by him are extant.
A literary celebrity by the age of 25, Goethe was ennobled by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Carl August in 1782 after first taking up residence there in November 1775 following the success of his first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther. He was an early participant in the Sturm und Drang literary movement. During his first ten years in Weimar, Goethe served as a member of the Duke's privy council, sat on the war and highway commissions, oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby Ilmenau, and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the University of Jena. He also contributed to the planning of Weimar's botanical park and the rebuilding of its Ducal Palace, which in 1998 were together designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[1]
After returning from a tour of Italy in 1788, his first major scientific work, the Metamorphosis of Plants, was published. In 1791 he was made managing director of the theatre at Weimar, and in 1794 he began a friendship with the dramatist, historian, and philosopher Friedrich Schiller, whose plays he premiered until Schiller's death in 1805. During this period Goethe published his second novel, Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, the verse epic Hermann and Dorothea, and, in 1808, the first part of his most celebrated drama, Faust. His conversations and various common undertakings throughout the 1790s with Schiller, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Johann Gottfried Herder, Alexander von Humboldt, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and August and Friedrich Schlegel have, in later years, been collectively termed Weimar Classicism.
Arthur Schopenhauer cited Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship as one of the four greatest novels ever written[citation needed] and Ralph Waldo Emerson selected Goethe as one of six "representative men" in his work of the same name, alongside men such as along with Plato, Napoleon, and William Shakespeare. Goethe's comments and observations form the basis of several biographical works, most notably Johann Peter Eckermann's Conversations with Goethe. There are frequent references to Goethe's various sayings and maxims throughout the course of Friedrich Nietzsche's work and there are numerous allusions to Goethe in the novels of Hermann Hesse and Thomas Mann as well as in the psychological writings of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. Goethe's poems were set to music throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by a number of composers, including Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Charles Gounod, Richard Wagner, Hugo Wolf, and Gustav Mahler.
Goethe's father, Johann Caspar Goethe, lived with his family in a large house in Frankfurt, then an Imperial Free City of the Holy Roman Empire. Though he had studied law in Leipzig and had been appointed Imperial Councillor, he was not involved in the city's official affairs.[2] 38-year-old Johann Caspar married Goethe's mother, Catharina Elizabeth Textor, the daughter of the mayor of Frankfurt Johann Wolfgang Textor and his wife Anna Margaretha Lindheimer, when she was 17 at Frankfurt on 20 August 1748. All their children, except for Goethe and his sister, Cornelia Friederike Christiana, who was born in 1750, died at early ages.
His father and private tutors gave Goethe lessons in all the common subjects of their time, especially languages (Latin, Greek, French, Italian, English and Hebrew). Goethe also received lessons in dancing, riding and fencing. Johann Caspar, feeling frustrated in his own ambitions, was determined that his children should have all those advantages that he had not.[2]
Goethe had a persistent dislike of the Roman Catholic Church, and characterized its history as a "hotchpotch of fallacy and violence" (Mischmasch von Irrtum und Gewalt).[3] His great passion was drawing. Goethe quickly became interested in literature; Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock and Homer were among his early favourites. He had a lively devotion to theatre as well and was greatly fascinated by puppet shows that were annually arranged in his home; a familiar theme in Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship.
He also took great pleasure in reading from the great works about history and religion. He writes about this period:
I had from childhood the singular habit of always learning by heart the beginnings of books, and the divisions of a work, first of the five books of Moses, and then of the 'Aeneid' and Ovid's 'Metamorphoses'. . . If an ever busy imagination, of which that tale may bear witness, led me hither and thither, if the medley of fable and history, mythology and religion, threatened to bewilder me, I readily fled to those oriental regions, plunged into the first books of Moses, and there, amid the scattered shepherd tribes, found myself at once in the greatest solitude and the greatest society.[4]
Goethe became acquainted with Frankfurt actors.[5] Around early literary attempts, he was infatuated with Gretchen, who would later reappear in his Faust and the adventures with whom he would concisely describe in Dichtung und Wahrheit.[6] He adored Charitas Meixner (27 July 1750 – 31 December 1773), a wealthy Worms trader's daughter and friend of his sister, who would later marry the merchant G. F. Schuler.[7]
Goethe studied law in Leipzig from 1765 to 1768. He detested learning age-old judicial rules by heart, preferring instead to attend the poetry lessons of Christian Fürchtegott Gellert. In Leipzig, Goethe fell in love with Anna Katharina Schönkopf and wrote cheerful verses about her in the Rococo genre. In 1770, he anonymously released Annette, his first collection of poems. His uncritical admiration for many contemporary poets vanished as he became interested in Lessing and Wieland. Already at this time, Goethe wrote a good deal, but he threw away nearly all of these works, except for the comedy Die Mitschuldigen. The restaurant Auerbachs Keller and its legend of Faust's 1525 barrel ride impressed him so much that Auerbachs Keller became the only real place in his closet drama Faust Part One. As his studies did not progress, Goethe was forced to return to Frankfurt at the close of August 1768.
In Frankfurt, Goethe became severely ill. During the year and a half that followed, because of several relapses, the relationship with his father worsened. During convalescence, Goethe was nursed by his mother and sister. In April 1770, Goethe left Frankfurt in order to finish his studies in Strasbourg.
In Alsace, Goethe blossomed. No other landscape has he described as affectionately as the warm, wide Rhine area. In Strasbourg, Goethe met Johann Gottfried Herder. The two became close friends, and crucially to Goethe's intellectual development, it was Herder who kindled his interest in Shakespeare, Ossian and in the notion of Volkspoesie (folk poetry). On 14 October 1772 he held a gathering in his parental home in honour of the first German "Shakespeare Day". His first acquaintance with Shakespeare's works is described as his personal awakening in literature.[8]
On a trip to the village Sessenheim, Goethe fell in love with Friederike Brion, in October 1770,[9][10] but, after ten months, terminated the relationship in August 1771.[11] Several of his poems, like Willkommen und Abschied, Sesenheimer Lieder and Heideröslein, originate from this time.
At the end of August 1771, Goethe acquired the academic degree of the Lizenziat (Licentia docendi) in Frankfurt and established a small legal practice. Although in his academic work he had expressed the ambition to make jurisprudence progressively more humane, his inexperience led him to proceed too vigorously in his first cases, and he was reprimanded and lost further ones. This prematurely terminated his career as a lawyer after only a few months. At this time, Goethe was acquainted with the court of Darmstadt, where his inventiveness was praised. From this milieu came Johann Georg Schlosser (who was later to become his brother-in-law) and Johann Heinrich Merck. Goethe also pursued literary plans again; this time, his father did not have anything against it, and even helped. Goethe obtained a copy of the biography of a noble highwayman from the German Peasants' War. In a couple of weeks the biography was reworked into a colourful drama. Entitled Götz von Berlichingen, the work went directly to the heart of Goethe's contemporaries.
Goethe could not subsist on being one of the editors of a literary periodical (published by Schlosser and Merck). In May 1772 he once more began the practice of law at Wetzlar. In 1774 he wrote the book which would bring him worldwide fame, The Sorrows of Young Werther. The outer shape of the work's plot is widely taken over from what Goethe experienced during his Wetzlar time with Charlotte Buff (1753–1828)[12] and her fiancé, Johann Christian Kestner (1741–1800),[12] as well as from the suicide of the author's friend Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem (1747–1772); in it, Goethe made a desperate passion of what was in reality a hearty and relaxed friendship.[13] Despite the immense success of Werther, it did not bring Goethe much financial gain because copyright laws at the time were essentially nonexistent. (In later years Goethe would bypass this problem by periodically authorizing "new, revised" editions of his Complete Works.)[14]
In 1775, Goethe was invited, on the strength of his fame as the author of The Sorrows of Young Werther, to the court of Carl August, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, who would become Grand Duke in 1815. (The Duke at the time was 18 years of age, to Goethe's 26.) Goethe thus went to live in Weimar, where he remained for the rest of his life and where, over the course of many years, he held a succession of offices, becoming the Duke's chief adviser.
In 1776, Goethe formed a close relationship to Charlotte von Stein, an older, married woman. The intimate bond with Frau von Stein lasted for ten years, after which Goethe abruptly left for Italy without giving his companion any notice. She was emotionally distraught at the time, but they were eventually reconciled.[15]
Goethe, aside from official duties, was also a friend and confidant to the Duke, and participated fully in the activities of the court. For Goethe, his first ten years at Weimar could well be described as a garnering of a degree and range of experience which perhaps could be achieved in no other way. Goethe was ennobled in 1782 (this being indicated by the "von" in his name).
Goethe's journey to the Italian peninsula from 1786 to 1788 was of great significance in his aesthetic and philosophical development. His father had made a similar journey during his own youth, and his example was a major motivating factor for Goethe to make the trip. More importantly, however, the work of Johann Joachim Winckelmann had provoked a general renewed interest in the classical art of ancient Greece and Rome. Thus Goethe's journey had something of the nature of a pilgrimage to it. During the course of his trip Goethe met and befriended the artists Angelica Kauffman and Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein, as well as encountering such notable characters as Lady Hamilton and Alessandro Cagliostro (see Affair of the Diamond Necklace).
He also journeyed to Sicily during this time, and wrote intriguingly that "To have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is to not have seen Italy at all, for Sicily is the clue to everything." While in Southern Italy and Sicily, Goethe encountered, for the first time genuine Greek (as opposed to Roman) architecture, and was quite startled by its relative simplicity. Winckelmann had not recognized the distinctness of the two styles.
Goethe's diaries of this period form the basis of the non-fiction Italian Journey. Italian Journey only covers the first year of Goethe's visit. The remaining year is largely undocumented, aside from the fact that he spent much of it in Venice. This "gap in the record" has been the source of much speculation over the years.
In the decades which immediately followed its publication in 1816 Italian Journey inspired countless German youths to follow Goethe's example. This is pictured, somewhat satirically, in George Eliot's Middlemarch.

In late 1792, Goethe took part in the battle of Valmy against revolutionary France, assisting Duke Carl August of Saxe-Weimar during the failed invasion of France. Again during the Siege of Mainz he assisted Carl August as a military observer. His written account of these events can be found within his Complete Works.
In 1794 Friedrich Schiller wrote to Goethe offering friendship; they had previously had only a mutually wary relationship ever since first becoming acquainted in 1788. This collaborative friendship lasted until Schiller's death in 1805.
In 1806, Goethe was living in Weimar with his mistress Christiane Vulpius, the sister of Christian A Vulpius, and their son Julius August Walter von Goethe. On 13 October, Napoleon's army invaded the town. The French "spoon guards," the least-disciplined soldiers, occupied Goethe's house.
The 'spoon guards' had broken in, they had drunk wine, made a great uproar and called for the master of the house. Goethe's secretary Riemer reports: 'Although already undressed and wearing only his wide nightgown... he descended the stairs towards them and inquired what they wanted from him.... His dignified figure, commanding respect, and his spiritual mien seemed to impress even them.' But it was not to last long. Late at night they burst into his bedroom with drawn bayonets. Goethe was petrified, Christiane raised a lot of noise and even tangled with them, other people who had taken refuge in Goethe’s house rushed in, and so the marauders eventually withdrew again. It was Christiane who commanded and organized the defense of the house on the Frauenplan. The barricading of the kitchen and the cellar against the wild pillaging soldiery was her work. Goethe noted in his diary: "Fires, rapine, a frightful night... Preservation of the house through steadfastness and luck." The luck was Goethe’s, the steadfastness was displayed by Christiane.
The next day, Goethe legitimized their 18-year relationship by marrying Christiane in a quiet marriage service at the court chapel. They already had several children together by this time, including their son, Julius August Walter von Goethe (25 December 1789 – 28 October 1830), whose wife, Ottilie von Pogwisch (31 October 1796 – 26 October 1872), cared for the elder Goethe until his death in 1832. The younger couple had three children: Walther, Freiherr von Goethe (9 April 1818 – 15 April 1885), Wolfgang, Freiherr von Goethe (18 September 1820 – 20 January 1883) and Alma von Goethe (29 October 1827 – 29 September 1844). Christiane von Goethe died in 1816.
After 1793, Goethe devoted his endeavours primarily to literature. By 1820, Goethe was on amiable terms with Kaspar Maria von Sternberg. In 1823, having recovered from a near fatal heart illness, Goethe fell in love with Ulrike von Levetzow whom he wanted to marry, but because of the opposition of her mother he never proposed. Their last meeting in Carlsbad on 5 September 1823 inspired him to the famous Marienbad Elegy which he considered one of his finest works.[17] During that time he also developed a deep emotional bond with the Polish pianist Maria Agata Szymanowska.[citation needed]
In 1832, Goethe died in Weimar of apparent heart failure. His last words, according to his doctor Carl Vogel, were, "Mehr Licht!" ("More light!'), but this is disputed as Vogel was not in the room at the moment Goethe died.[18] He is buried in the Ducal Vault at Weimar's Historical Cemetery.
The morning after Goethe's death, a deep desire seized me to look once again upon his earthly garment. His faithful servant, Frederick, opened for me the chamber in which he was laid out. Stretched upon his back, he reposed as if asleep; profound peace and security reigned in the features of his sublimely noble countenance. The mighty brow seemed yet to harbour thoughts. I wished for a lock of his hair; but reverence prevented me from cutting it off. The body lay naked, only wrapped in a white sheet; large pieces of ice had been placed near it, to keep it fresh as long as possible. Frederick drew aside the sheet, and I was astonished at the divine magnificence of the limbs. The breast was powerful, broad, and arched; the arms and thighs were elegant, and of the most perfect shape; nowhere, on the whole body, was there a trace of either fat or of leanness and decay. A perfect man lay in great beauty before me; and the rapture the sight caused me made me forget for a moment that the immortal spirit had left such an abode. I laid my hand on his heart – there was a deep silence – and I turned away to give free vent to my suppressed tears.
The first production of Richard Wagner's opera Lohengrin took place in Weimar in 1850. The conductor was Franz Liszt, who chose the date 28 August in honour of Goethe, who was born on 28 August 1749.[19]
The most important of Goethe's works produced before he went to Weimar were Götz von Berlichingen (1773), a tragedy that was the first work to bring him recognition, and the novel The Sorrows of Young Werther (called Die Leiden des jungen Werthers in German) (1774), which gained him enormous fame as a writer in the Sturm und Drang period which marked the early phase of Romanticism – indeed the book is often considered to be the "spark" which ignited the movement, and can arguably be called the world's first "best-seller". (For the entirety of his life this was the work with which the vast majority of Goethe's contemporaries associated him). During the years at Weimar before he met Schiller he began Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, wrote the dramas Iphigenie auf Tauris (Iphigenia in Tauris), Egmont, Torquato Tasso, and the fable Reineke Fuchs.
To the period of his friendship with Schiller belong the conception of Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years (the continuation of Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship), the idyll of Hermann and Dorothea, the Roman Elegies and the verse drama The Natural Daughter. In the last period, between Schiller's death, in 1805, and his own, appeared Faust Part One, Elective Affinities, the West-Eastern Divan (a collection of poems in the Persian style, influenced by the work of Hafez), his autobiographical Aus meinem Leben: Dichtung und Wahrheit (From My Life: Poetry and Truth) which covers his early life and ends with his departure for Weimar, his Italian Journey, and a series of treatises on art. His writings were immediately influential in literary and artistic circles.
Goethe was fascinated by Kalidasa's Abhijñānaśākuntalam, which was one of the first works of Sanskrit literature that became known in Europe, after being translated from English to German.[20]
Faust Part Two was only finished in the year of his death, and was published posthumously. Also published after his death was the so-called Urfaust, the first sketches, made probably in 1773–74. [21]
The short epistolary novel, Die Leiden des jungen Werthers, or The Sorrows of Young Werther, published in 1774, recounts an unhappy romantic infatuation that ends in suicide. Goethe admitted that he "shot his hero to save himself": a reference to Goethe's own near-suicidal obsession with a young woman during this period, an obsession he quelled through the writing process. The novel remains in print in dozens of languages and its influence is undeniable; its central hero, an obsessive figure driven to despair and destruction by his unrequited love for the young Lotte, has become a pervasive literary archetype. The fact that Werther ends with the protagonist's suicide and funeral—a funeral which "no clergyman attended"—made the book deeply controversial upon its (anonymous) publication, for on the face of it, it appeared to condone and glorify suicide. Suicide was considered sinful by Christian doctrine: suicides were denied Christian burial with the bodies often mistreated and dishonoured in various ways; in corollary, the deceased's property and possessions were often confiscated by the Church.[22] Epistolary novels were common during this time, letter-writing being a primary mode of communication. What set Goethe's book apart from other such novels was its expression of unbridled longing for a joy beyond possibility, its sense of defiant rebellion against authority, and of principal importance, its total subjectivity: qualities that trailblazed the Romantic movement.
The next work, his epic closet drama Faust, was to be completed in stages, and only published in its entirety after his death. The first part was published in 1808 and created a sensation. The first operatic version, by Spohr, appeared in 1814, and was subsequently the inspiration for operas and oratorios by Schumann, Berlioz, Gounod, Boito, Busoni, and Schnittke as well as symphonic works by Liszt, Wagner, and Mahler. Faust became the ur-myth of many figures in the 19th century. Later, a facet of its plot, i.e., of selling one's soul to the devil for power over the physical world, took on increasing literary importance and became a view of the victory of technology and of industrialism, along with its dubious human expenses. In 1919, the Goetheanum staged the world premiere of a complete production of Faust. On occasion, the play is still staged in Germany and other parts around the world.

Goethe's poetic work served as a model for an entire movement in German poetry termed Innerlichkeit ("introversion") and represented by, for example, Heine. Goethe's words inspired a number of compositions by, among others, Mozart, Beethoven (who idolised Goethe),[24] Schubert, Berlioz and Wolf. Perhaps the single most influential piece is "Mignon's Song" which opens with one of the most famous lines in German poetry, an allusion to Italy: "Kennst du das Land, wo die Zitronen blühn?" ("Do you know the land where the lemon trees bloom?").
He is also widely quoted. Epigrams such as "Against criticism a man can neither protest nor defend himself; he must act in spite of it, and then it will gradually yield to him", "Divide and rule, a sound motto; unite and lead, a better one", and "Enjoy when you can, and endure when you must", are still in usage or are often paraphrased. Lines from Faust, such as "Das also war des Pudels Kern", "Das ist der Weisheit letzter Schluss", or "Grau ist alle Theorie" have entered everyday German usage.
It may be taken as another measure of Goethe's fame that other well-known quotations are often incorrectly attributed to him, such as Hippocrates' "Art is long, life is short", which is found in Goethe's Faust ("Art is something so long to be learned, and life is so short!") and Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship.
As to what I have done as a poet,... I take no pride in it... But that in my century I am the only person who knows the truth in the difficult science of colours – of that, I say, I am not a little proud, and here I have a consciousness of a superiority to many.
Although his literary work has attracted the greatest amount of interest, Goethe was also keenly involved in studies of natural science.[25] He wrote several works on morphology, and colour theory. Goethe also had the largest private collection of minerals in all of Europe. By the time of his death, in order to gain a comprehensive view in geology, he had collected 17,800 rock samples.
His focus on morphology and what was later called homology influenced 19th century naturalists, although his ideas of transformation were about the continuous metamorphosis of living things and did not relate to contemporary ideas of "transformisme" or transmutation of species. Homology, or as Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire called it "analogie", was used by Charles Darwin as strong evidence of common descent and of laws of variation.[26] Goethe's studies led him to independently discover the human intermaxillary bone in 1784, which Broussonet (1779) and Vicq d'Azyr (1780) had (using different methods) identified several years earlier.[27] While not the only one in his time to question the prevailing view that this bone did not exist in humans, Goethe, who believed ancient anatomists had known about this bone, was the first to prove its peculiarity to all mammals.
Light spectrum, from Theory of Colours. Goethe observed that with a prism, colour arises at light-dark edges, and the spectrum occurs where these coloured edges overlap.
During his Italian journey, Goethe formulated a theory of plant metamorphosis in which the archetypal form of the plant is to be found in the leaf – he writes, "from top to bottom a plant is all leaf, united so inseparably with the future bud that one cannot be imagined without the other".[28] In 1790, he published his Metamorphosis of Plants.[29] As one of the many precursors in the history of evolutionary thought, Goethe wrote in Story of My Botanical Studies (1831):
The ever-changing display of plant forms, which I have followed for so many years, awakens increasingly within me the notion: The plant forms which surround us were not all created at some given point in time and then locked into the given form, they have been given... a felicitous mobility and plasticity that allows them to grow and adapt themselves to many different conditions in many different places.[30]
Goethe also popularized the Goethe barometer using a principle established by Torricelli. According to Hegel, 'Goethe has occupied himself a good deal with meteorology; barometer readings interested him particularly... What he says is important: the main thing is that he gives a comparative table of barometric readings during the whole month of December 1822, at Weimar, Jena, London, Boston, Vienna, Töpel... He claims to deduce from it that the barometric level varies in the same propoportion not only in each zone but that it has the same variation, too, at different altitudes above sea-level'.[31]
In 1810, Goethe published his Theory of Colours, which he considered his most important work. In it, he contentiously characterized color as arising from the dynamic interplay of light and darkness through the mediation of a turbid medium.[32] In 1816, Schopenhauer went on to develop his own theory in On Vision and Colors based on the observations supplied in Goethe's book. After being translated into English by Charles Eastlake in 1840, his theory became widely adopted by the art world, most notably J. M. W. Turner.[33] Goethe's work also inspired the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, to write his Remarks on Color. Goethe was vehemently opposed to Newton's analytic treatment of color, engaging instead in compiling a comprehensive rational description of a wide variety of color phenomena. Although the accuracy of Goethe's observations does not admit a great deal of criticism, his theory's failure to demonstrate significant predictive validity eventually rendered it scientifically irrelevant. Goethe was, however, the first to systematically study the physiological effects of color, and his observations on the effect of opposed colors led him to a symmetric arrangement of his color wheel, 'for the colors diametrically opposed to each other... are those which reciprocally evoke each other in the eye. (Goethe, Theory of Colours, 1810).[34] In this, he anticipated Ewald Hering's opponent color theory (1872).[35]
Goethe outlines his method in the essay The experiment as mediator between subject and object (1772).[36] In the Kurschner edition of Goethe's works, the science editor, Rudolf Steiner, presents Goethe's approach to science as phenomenological. Steiner elaborated on that in the books The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception[37] and Goethe's World View,[38] in which he characterizes intuition as the instrument by which one grasps Goethe's biological archetype—The Typus.
Novalis, himself a geologist and mining engineer, expressed the opinion that Goethe was the first physicist of his time and 'epoch-making in the history of physics', writing that Goethe's studies of light, of the metamorphosis of plants and of insects were indications and proofs 'that the perfect educational lecture belongs in the artist's sphere of work'; and that Goethe would be surpassed 'but only in the way in which the ancients can be surpassed, in inner content and force, in variety and depth – as an artist actually not, or only very little, for his rightness and intensity are perhaps already more exemplary than it would seem'. [39]
Many of Goethe's works, especially Faust, the Roman Elegies, and the Venetian Epigrams, depict erotic passions and acts. For instance, in Faust, the first use of Faust's power after literally signing a contract with the devil is to fall in love with and impregnate a teenage girl. Some of the Venetian Epigrams were held back from publication due to their sexual content. Goethe clearly saw human sexuality as a topic worthy of poetic and artistic depiction, an idea that was uncommon in a time when the private nature of sexuality was rigorously normative.[40]
Born into a Lutheran family, Goethe's early faith was shaken by news of such events as the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and the Seven Years' War. In July 1782, he described himself as "not anti-Christian, nor un-Christian, but most decidedly non-Christian."[41] In his Venetian Epigram 66, Goethe listed four things that he disliked: "tobacco smoke, bugs and garlic and the cross."[42][43] In the book Conversations with Goethe by Goethe's secretary Eckermann, however, Goethe is portrayed as enthusiastic about Christianity, Jesus, Martin Luther, and the Protestant Reformation, even calling Christianity the "ultimate religion".[44][45][46] Although he opposed many of the central teachings of the Christian churches, he thought that he could nevertheless be inwardly Christian.[47]
His later spiritual perspective evolved among pantheism (heavily influenced by Spinoza), humanism, and various elements of Western esotericism, as seen most vividly in Part II of Faust. According to Nietzsche, Goethe had "a kind of almost joyous and trusting fatalism" that has "faith that only in the totality everything redeems itself and appears good and justified."[48]
On the other hand, a year before his death, in a letter to Sulpiz Boisserée, Goethe wrote that he had the feeling that all his life he had been aspiring to qualify as one of the Hypsistarians, an ancient Jewish-pagan sect of the Black Sea region. After describing his difficulties with mainstream religion, he mentioned that he had learned of this sect who, hemmed in between heathens, Jews and Christians, declared that they would reverence, as being close to the Godhead, what came to their knowledge of the best and most perfect.[49]
In politics, Goethe was conservative. At the time of the French Revolution, he thought the enthusiasm of the students and professors to be a perversion of their energy and remained skeptical of the ability of the masses to govern.[50] Likewise, he did not oppose the War of Liberation (1813–15) waged by the German states against Napoleon, and remained aloof from the patriotic efforts to unite the various parts of Germany into one nation.
Goethe had a great effect on the nineteenth century. In many respects, he was the originator of many ideas which later became widespread. He produced volumes of poetry, essays, criticism, a theory of colours and early work on evolution and linguistics. He was fascinated by mineralogy, and the mineral goethite (iron oxide) is named after him.[51] His non-fiction writings, most of which are philosophic and aphoristic in nature, spurred the development of many philosophers, including G.W.F. Hegel, Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ernst Cassirer, Carl Jung, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Along with Schiller, he was one of the leading figures of Weimar Classicism.
Goethe embodied many of the contending strands in art over the next century: his work could be lushly emotional, and rigorously formal, brief and epigrammatic, and epic. He would argue that classicism was the means of controlling art, and that romanticism was a sickness, even as he penned poetry rich in memorable images, and rewrote the formal rules of German poetry. Even in contemporary culture, he stands in the background as the author of the ballad upon which Disney's The Sorcerer's Apprentice is based.
His poetry was set to music by almost every major Austrian and German composer from Mozart to Mahler, and his influence would spread to French drama and opera as well. Beethoven declared that a "Faust" Symphony would be the greatest thing for art. Liszt and Mahler both created symphonies in whole or in large part inspired by this seminal work, which would give the 19th century one of its most paradigmatic figures: Doctor Faustus.
The Faust tragedy/drama, often called Das Drama der Deutschen (the drama of the Germans), written in two parts published decades apart, would stand as his most characteristic and famous artistic creation. Followers of the twentieth century esotericist Rudolf Steiner built a theatre named the Goetheanum after him—where festival performances of Faust are still performed.
Goethe was also a cultural force, who argued that the organic nature of the land moulded the people and their customs—an argument that has recurred ever since. He argued that laws could not be created by pure rationalism, since geography and history shaped habits and patterns. This stood in sharp contrast to the prevailing Enlightenment view that reason was sufficient to create well-ordered societies and good laws.
It was to a considerable degree due to Goethe's reputation that the city of Weimar was chosen in 1919 as the venue for the national assembly, convened to draft a new constitution for what would become known as Germany's Weimar Republic.
The Federal Republic of Germany's cultural institution, The Goethe-Institut is named after him, and promotes the study of German abroad and fosters knowledge about Germany by providing information on its culture, society and politics.
The literary estate of Goethe in the Goethe and Schiller Archives was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2001 in recognition of its historical significance.[52]
Goethe's influence was dramatic because he understood that there was a transition in European sensibilities, an increasing focus on sense, the indescribable, and the emotional. This is not to say that he was emotionalistic or excessive; on the contrary, he lauded personal restraint and felt that excess was a disease: "There is nothing worse than imagination without taste". He argued in his scientific works that a "formative impulse", which he said is operative in every organism, causes an organism to form itself according to its own distinct laws, and therefore rational laws or fiats could not be imposed at all from a higher, transcendent sphere; this placed him in direct opposition to those who attempted to form "enlightened" monarchies based on "rational" laws by, for example, Joseph II of Austria or the subsequent Emperor of the French, Napoleon I. A quotation from Goethe's Scientific Studies will suffice:
We conceive of the individual animal as a small world, existing for its own sake, by its own means. Every creature is its own reason to be. All its parts have a direct effect on one another, a relationship to one another, thereby constantly renewing the circle of life; thus we are justified in considering every animal physiologically perfect. Viewed from within, no part of the animal is a useless or arbitrary product of the formative impulse (as so often thought). Externally, some parts may seem useless because the inner coherence of the animal nature has given them this form without regard to outer circumstance. Thus...[not] the question, What are they for? but rather, Where do they come from?
That change later became the basis for 19th-century thought: organic rather than geometrical, evolving rather than created, and based on sensibility and intuition rather than on imposed order, culminating in, as Goethe said, a "living quality", wherein the subject and object are dissolved together in a poise of inquiry. Consequently, Goethe embraced neither teleological nor deterministic views of growth within every organism. Instead, his view was that the world as a whole grows through continual, external, and internal strife. Moreover, Goethe did not embrace the mechanistic views that contemporaneous science subsumed during his time, and therewith he denied rationality's superiority as the sole interpreter of reality. Furthermore, Goethe declared that all knowledge is related to humanity through its functional value alone and that knowledge presupposes a perspectival quality. He also stated that the fundamental nature of the world is aesthetic[citation needed].
His views make him, along with Adam Smith, Thomas Jefferson, and Ludwig van Beethoven, a figure in two worlds: on the one hand, devoted to the sense of taste, order, and finely crafted detail, which is the hallmark of the artistic sense of the Age of Reason and the neo-classical period of architecture; on the other, seeking a personal, intuitive, and personalized form of expression and society, firmly supporting the idea of self-regulating and organic systems. Thinkers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson would take up many similar ideas in the 1800s. Goethe's ideas on evolution would frame the question that Darwin and Wallace would approach within the scientific paradigm. The Serbian inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla was heavily influenced by Goethe's Faust, his favorite poem, and had actually memorized the entire text. It was while reciting a certain verse that he was struck with the epiphany that would lead to the idea of the rotating magnetic field and ultimately, alternating current.[53]

Johan Wolfgang von Goethe was born in Frankfurt-am-Main in 1749. He studied law in Leipzig, and later in Strasburg. While studying law he became interested with the occult. The pivot of his life may well have been the moment he met  William Shakespeares work and heard folk poetry, through the guidance of Johann Gottfried Herder. At the age of twenty-four Goethe wrote Goetz von Berlichingen, a play that begot him national fame, and established him as the Sturm und Drang movement. In a matter of weeks, from a biography of a noble highwayman of the German Peasants War, the play arose. In 1774, Goethe wrote The Sorrows of Young Werther, which was an even greater success,  he would repeatedly rework it over the next dozen years.
The Sorrows of Young Werther is a fictional case history of a young, intelligent and rather charming man, who, under the spell of passion, blindly drifts into a disaster he does not see until his will to live has been sapped and his intelligence undermined. Book I is a series of letters, written to a friend - of whom the reader knows nothing more than that he is a displaced and always-there addressee - chart the itinerary of Werthers mental disintegration, up until the final moment. Werthers personality, as produced by his own pen, is an odd one; he is talented, sensitive, religious but without any adherence to dogma, devoted to nature, and her ways, over society and its conventions, and although observant, more inclined to reverie than interrogation. Moreover, he is under no pressure to conform for the sake of profitable employment, and is rather self-indulgent in a cult of pure feeling. The letters retell the night he met Lotte, and later, her fiancé. To his always-receptive friend, Werther admits his belief that it is he, and only he, who can make Lotte happy, truly happy, that is. In the last letter, he restages the last night, including his argument with the fiancé on the justification of suicide. On that same last night, in the next to last moment, Lotte unwittingly pushes Werthers undisciplined, indulgent, and somewhat revengeful ego to suicide - retelling her mothers final moments, her conviction that all who love will meet again in the next life; her words engrave a hope on the young mans bleeding heart, keeping it pounding as it drips a trail to his grave, but a few hours later.
Book II, is akin to an editors report; an editor who progressively follows Werther ever deeper into his private thoughts and silent moments, before returning to inscribe them on pages, for all to see. Lottes soul, with its unannounced and even unadmitted words, is no more beyond his grasp, then Werthers secret paths and indulgent fantasies. In the editors narration we hear Werthers alter ego, his justifications, his grounds and proofs, all from an all knowing and all seeing, other perspective.
The novel was a hit, his first bestseller. It brought its author nearly as much fame as it did criticism. Both, ironically, over the same misread element  the glorification of suicide. Werther, nonetheless, as should have been anyways, became a literary archetype.
Before becoming an advisor to the Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and holding a series of offices in the Weimar government, Goethe began work on Faust, and another play, Egmont. In September 1786, Goethe fled to Italy. Without word, or sign, to a single soul, he withdrew to find himself. Fearing he had become more a courtier and functionary than a poet, he left the world that made him such. The first year of this odyssey, he recounted in the Italian Journey. There, in the tranquil chaos of Sicily, Goethe returned to his Faust, and began Iphigenie auf Tauris, and Torquato Tasso.
After his return, in 1788, Goethe took part in the Battle of Valmy and the Siege of Mainz  parts of a failed invasion of revolutionary France. (A written account of these events in found within his Complete Works) In some senses, he was politically conservative, primarily because the masses couldnt govern, even themselves. He did not oppose the War of Liberation, although he did oppose all efforts to unify Germany. He advocated only the maintenance of small principalities ruled by benevolent despots.
Following his return to Weimar, Goethe began his great friendship with Friedrich Schiller, in 1794. They had become acquainted immediately following Goethes return, in 1788, but maintained a rather wary relationship, until Schiller wrote to Goethe, formally proposing a friendship. Their collaborative friendship would last until Friedrich Schillers death in 1805. Friedrich Schiller is widely regarded as responsible for encouraging and advising Goethes work on Faust  parts I, and II.
From 1795 to 1800, he continued work on Faust: part I, as well as writing Wilhelm Meisters Apprentice Years, and a series of poems, including the Roman Elegies. Friedrich Schillers death, in 1805, would coincide with grave illness, depression and another withdrawal.
Following the Battle of Jena, and Napoleons victory over, and invasion of, Prussia, in 1806, Goethe began the sequel to Wilhelm Meisters Apprentice Years, entitled, Wilhelm Meisters Years of Travel, as well as his autobiography, Poetry and Truth. In 1809, a year after the publication of Faust: part I, Goethe was received by Napoleon, and awarded the Cross of the Legion of Honor; at the moment of their meeting, Napoleon, emperor of Europe, facing Goethe, uttered Behold, man!.
Faust: part I was written over the course of over thirty years, in four distinct phases: 1772-5, 1788-90, 1797-1801, and 1806. Unlike the sentimental tragic hero of Werther, Faust is perhaps the least sympathetic hero in world literature; to the point, where his author, through Mephisto  Satan  often sides against him. Curiously (for us who have gone through structuralism, and see precisely this as the ultimate tragedy) this is largely on account of his almost non-existence, his puppet-like place in the narrative. This utter subjugation is best summarized in Mephistos own words: Fool easily misled, that is the magic art. Unlike other literary accounts of a confrontation with Satan, where the hero awakes at the sight of that charming face, Faust is at his intelligent peak before his wager, after which, or better, during which he morphs into little more than a cart on a track  he is merely acted upon, with little to no resistance. Is Faust a tragedy, is a question hinging on whether we read his dealings with the devil as a pact or a wager. Read as a wager, Faust is a tragic figure, for he must lose if he is to win, and in order to win he must ultimately lose. That is, to escape damnation he must suffer unremitting dissatisfaction and disappointment in life, while a crumb of happiness or even mere content reveals itself frivolous in face of its cost, eternal damnation. Is it any wonder that both Hegel and Nietzsche would come to utter Pontius Pilates words for Goethe - as Napoleon did too; or as Bulgakov repeated, in his meeting with the devil?  
Goethe reveals a paradox, or better, a paradox exchanged for tragedy, between the human and the ontological. In the opening scenes, Faust - at his peak  sits in angst questioning the nature of reality and illusion. Mephisto, on the other hand reveals to Faust the utter incommensurability of that symbiotic duality, which he comes to unblinkingly accept, to the point where the ultimate outcome of his wager seems of little importance. The homunculus, which Faust fathers as his third child, is a theatrical image for the human work, or specifically the work of art itself: a form, an objectification of something miniscule and human, which keeps its form for but a blink of a eye, before collapsing again into a stupid primeval flux. As the form to the flux, so man to the form, does not act but is acted upon until he is desiccated and discarded. Words, Mephisto reveals, make and unmake the images of all creatures, with no goal or benevolence: They do not see you, they see only patterns. Man, for Goethe, is lured and stimulated by objects of desire, which assume their place in embodiments of the Eternal Female, first Gretchen, and then Helen, but in the end, of course, neither. These lures, are what form forms from the formless, as women birth children by accident. In Faust women incarnate shadows into real things, forming labyrinths of acts and objects, deceiving men into positing some real, stable substance behind them, when in fact there is nothing more than stupid, primordial flux. 
Over the course of the next decade Goethe would begin work on Faust: part II, and publish a collection of poems, entitled, West-Eastern Divan  written for his new love, Marianne von Willemer, as much as the Roman Elegies were for his last.
In 1821, Goethe would publish Wilhelm Meisters Years of Travel. In 1823-4, now in love with Ulrike von Levetzov, Goethe would write the poems, Trilogy of Passion. The remainder of the decade, Goethe largely spent work for and finishing Faust: part II.

 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832), German poet, playwright, novelist, and natural philosopher is best known for his two-part poetic drama Faust, (1808-1832) which he started around the age of twenty three and didn't finish till shortly before his death sixty years later. He is considered one of the greatest contributors of the German Romantic period. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was born on 28 August 1749 in Frankfurt, Germany; his father the Imperial Councillor Johann Kaspar Goethe (1710-1782) and his mother Katharina Elisabeth neé Textor (1731-1808). 
Goethe's early years of education were inconsistent; informally from his father and then with tutors. However, he managed a grasp of Greek, Latin, French, and Italian by the age of eight, and his mother taught him well in the art of story-telling. At the age of sixteen, in 1765, Goethe went to Leipzig University to study law as his father wished, though he also gained much recognition from the Rococo poems and lyric he wrote during this period. In 1766 he fell in love with Anne Catharina Schoenkopf (1746-1810) and wrote his joyfully exuberant collection of poems Annette.In 1768 Goethe wrote his Leipzig Songbook (1768)--ten poems to melodies composed by Bernhard Theodor Breitkopf--while he was convalescing from a severe lung infection. Nurse Susanne Katharina von Klettenberg, a relative of his mother's, introduced him to protestant piety and pansophic-alchemistic works in the neo-platonic tradition.In 1770 Goethe continued his law studies in Strasbourg as well as attending lectures in history, political science, anatomy, surgery, and chemistry. He met daily with philosopher, poet, and theologian Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) avant-gardist of the Sturm und Drang movement. Sesenheimer (1770-1771) was  published, followed by Neue Lieder in Melodien gesetzt von B.T.Breitkopf (1770), Goethe's first printed anthology of poems. Goethe earned his degree and was promoted to licentitatus juris in 1771. He returned to Frankfurt where he began to practice law, though he was much more absorbed with writing Götz von Berlichingen (1773), a story of a 16th century robber baron, representing Goethe's youthful protest against the established order and his desire for intellectual freedom. It would become his first dramatic success.
Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774) a novel written in monologue, inspired by his unrequited love for Charlotte Buff, the fiancé of a friend, became a worldwide success for him at the age of 25. It attained cult status and is a good example of the Sturm und Drang literary movement's intense respect for human emotion. Goethe received many admirers from Europe's nobility, Princes Karl August and Konstantin von Sachsen-Weimar among them. In 1775 Goethe's engagement with Lili Schönemann (1758-1817) dissolved. That same year he was invited to the court of Duke Karl August at Weimar, where he remained for the majority of the rest of his life producing melodramas, operettas, and plays including Erwin und Elmire. Ein Schauspiel mit Gesang, for entertaining the court.In 1776 Goethe was granted Weimar citizenship and appointed Geheimer Legationsrat with a seat and vote in the state's highest office, thus with a secured income. In 1777 Goethe's sister Cornelia died. After being appointed Head of the Commission for War and Road Construction he took a second trip to Switzerland in the company of Duke Karl August. Goethe wrote his first version of Iphigenie, a play published later in 1787 as Ipigenie auf Tauris which is based on Greek mythology.In 1781 Goethe was conducting mineralogical studies and lectures about human anatomy at the Liberal School of Drawing in Weimar. A year later he was conferred a title of nobility, "von Goethe", by Emperor Joseph II. Around this time he moved to a house at the "Frauenplan" in Weimar which remained his home until his demise. As part of his on-going studies in anatomy, in the year 1784, Goethe discovered the human intermaxillary bone.In 1786, he travelled to Italy and was impressed by Greek and Roman sculpture, architecture, and literature. There he met Christiane Vulpius (17651816), beautiful yet with little education, who became his wife and the mother of his children. Though she did not accompany him into society, they finally married in 1806.In 1787 Goethe was busy pursuing geological and botanical studies in Naples and Sicily and climbed Mount Vesuvius; but he continued to write and next penned his first version of Faust. His journey to Venice in 1790 was where he wrote Venetianischen Epigramme and his play Torquato Tasso about the Italian poet Torquato Tasso (1544-95).Goethe's aesthetic theory was partially influenced by his friend Friedrich von Schiller (1759-1805), of whose journal Die Horen (1795-1797) he contributed articles to. During a congress of monarchs in Erfurt in 1808, Goethe met with Napoleon Bonaparte, an avid reader of his works. Faust Part I was published in 1808, Goethe's masterpiece of the courtly-mannered persona of Mephistopheles striking a deal with God (based on the same legend as Christopher Marlowe's Dr. Faustus).In 1831 Goethe brought Faust to an end, sealing the manuscript and ordering it to be published only after his death. Fully expecting to recover from yet another fever and infection, Goethe died unexpectedly on 22 March 1832 in Weimar; it is said his last words were a request to a servant to open another shutter to let in more light, whilst Goethe traced letters in the air.Johann Wolfgang von Goethe now rests in the Fürstengruft or "Royal Tomb" in the Historischer Friedhof "Historic Cemetery" in Wiemar where his dear friend Schiller is also laid to rest. In honour of these two famous German men of letters, a statue of Goethe and Schiller now stands at the German National Theatre in Munich.

does anybody know, which is the original German title of this poem from Goethe. I've been looking for it for a month now, but still nothing.
Because I am asked by my professor to compare between Goethe's East West Divan and Yeat's A Gift of Haroun Al-Rashid.
Can "so divinely is the world organized that every one of us, in our place and time, is in balance with everything else" be accredited to Goethe?
Someone said "it is the philosophy of Leibnitz who was lampooned by Voltaire in Candide--'everything for the best in the best of all possible worlds' ".
An interesting element in the Conversations is Goethe's advice to his young friend who was interested in poetry. I assume his advice is also applicable today to young writers as it was some 150 years ago. Thus he y-urges Eckermann to found his poems on actual experiences and to seek inspiration in realities -- not in large and vague reflections. "I attach no value to poems snatched out of the air," says he. 
"While you content yourself with generalities everyone can imitate you; but in the particular no one can -- and why? because no others have experienced exactly the same thing."
Does anybody know if the Matthew Lewis translation of Faust I is in print? Or if it even exists today?
Goethe is one of my most loved writers. Maybe just because I like to think widely taking in process all delibereted subjects and ideas. His Faust is incredible. Putting on the stage all questions of Creation Goethe solves them in a very striking way. This work of him is one of my most favourite. Would like to know what you think about it. Or maybe, it would be better if we study it, eh? I mean, what if I place here some excerpts of Faust and we could think together about them? And surely you can say what you think about the work on the whole.
ps...have you ever heard that there was one hero besides Faust and Mefistofel in "Faust"? It called  "Der Kolobokk". It is very funny because it is the hero of russian kid stories. (I laughed a lot hearing about it).
There was a time when Goethe was widely read, both in the German-speaking lands and also much further afield, too. For quite a long time (c. 1775- 1850 or longer) he was even a 'cult-figure' for many. He probably did more than anyone else to put German literature on the international map, so to speak.
Has Goethe simply sunk to the status of a 'great name' in World Literature that nobody reads any more?
It occurs to me that it may be of some significance that this seems to be the very first post on him.

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was born in Frankfurt, Germany to a wealthy family. Because of his family's station in life, Goethe had the privileges of affluence and education that allowed him to study all the common subjects of the day and to specialize in languages and literature. Goethe attended the University of Leipzig where he studied law, though he left to go to Strasbourg where he finished his studies. While in Strasbourg, his literary and philosophical talent was allowed to flourish. His first play, Götz von Berlichingen, was an immediate success across Germany.
Goethe epitomized the Renaissance man in his roles of poet, novelist, scientist, administrator, and critic. Some have referred to him as the German Shakespeare, as he was a master of the German language. During his career, he held most of the major posts in the Weimar government, including the Privy Councilor at the Duke of Weimar's court, where he coordinated major mining, road building, and irrigation projects. In addition, Goethe painted, worked on anatomy and botany, created a theory of colors, and directed a theater for 26 years.Goethe was friends with many important European thinkers and philosophers during his life. As a student, Goethe became close to Johann Gottfried Herder whose theories of aesthetics, especially in the work of Shakespeare, was pivotal for Goethe's early works. It was from Herder and his influence on Goethe that the German Sturm und Drang movement was born. Later in life, Goethe would develop a close friendship with Friedrich Schiller whose work attempted to synthesize Kant's philosophy with other European schools of thought.The most complete German edition of Goethe's works, letters, and diaries fills 143 volumes. His novel The Sorrows of Young Werther, completed in 1774, is so powerful that it actually inspired many young men and women to commit suicide; the story of the tragic Werther was found on many of their corpses. Two of his later dramas, Iphigenia in Taurus (1787) and Torquato Tasso (1790), are famous for their classical restraint.However, Goethe's masterpiece is Faust, which focuses on the search for the meaning of existence and of the soul. The original publication in 1790 was titled Faust: A Fragment. Faust soon became a lifelong obsession for Goethe, who worked on the play for more than 60 years and completed the final draft only months before he died on March 22, 1832. He was 82 at the time. Faust elucidated the ideas that no philosophic system can explain the world, that man is not reducible into individual concepts, and that literature can reflect the arbitrariness of life. Goethe's writings drew upon and inspired poets and philosophers such as Nietzsche, Beckett, and Kafka.

An iconic figure of the German Romanticism, Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany on August 28, 1749. The multi talented Goethe, in addition to being a writer was also a theoretical physicist, biologist, polymath, pictorial artist and statesman. His services to poetry, pros and drama are an integral part of German literature. Goethe played a key role in the movement of Weimar Classicism, Sturm und Drang and Romanticism. He is credited for giving the Sturm und Drang movement its first major drama, Gtz von Berlichingen in 1733 and also its first main novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther in 1774, creating the classic archetype of a romantic hero.
As a young boy Goethe was given lessons by his father and private tutors in all the usual subjects of his time and specially languages including Latin, Greek, French, Italian, English and Hebrew along with training in riding, fencing and dancing. Goethe enjoyed theatre and drawing and was deeply interested in literature, devoting a lot of his time to reading works of Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock and Homer. Although Goethe studied law from 1765 to 1768 in Leipzeg, he was more interested in learning about poetry and attended poetry lessons by Christian Fürchtegott Gellert. He released his first collection of poems, Annette, published anonymously in 1770.
By 1771, Goethe had become a licensed lawyer. In an attempt to humanize the jurisdiction, Goethe proceeded cases too vigorously and as a result was reprimanded. He shifted his focus to his literary side and created the colorful courtroom drama, Götz von Berlichingen. He started practicing law again in 1772 and gave the world his masterpiece, The Sorrows of Young Werther in 1774.
Following the success of The Sorrows of Young Werther, Goethe was invited to the court of Carl August. Goethe thus moved to Weimar where he would remain for the rest of his life holding a succession of offices moving up to becoming the Duke’s chief advisor.  During 1786 to 1788, Goethe made a journey to Italy which he put to writing in the Italian Journey, published 1816. He married his long time mistress, Christiane Vulpius in 1806 when Napoleon’s army invaded the town of Weimar and occupied Goethe’s house.
1793 onwards, Goethe devoted all of his time to his literary work. He fell in love with Ulrike von Levetzow, who inspired his famous, Marienbad Elegy. Goethe considered this to be his finest work. Some more of Goethe’s most famous works marked in history include Wilhelm Meister’s Apprenticeship, the dramas Iphigenie auf Tauris, Egmont, Torquato Tasso, The Natural Daughter the fable Reineke Fuchs,  Furthermore, Faust Part One, Elective Affinities, the West-Eastern Divan, his autobiographical Aus meinem Leben: Dichtung und Wahrheit and Faust Part two which was finished and published posthumously.
Although Goethe is best known for his literary work, he also held a keen interest in science and wrote quite a lot on color theory and plant morphology. He owned the largest collection of minerals in Europe and his works greatly influenced naturalists of the 19th century. His works, Metamorphosis of Plants (1790) and Theory of Colors (1810) are some of his important scientific endeavors.
Leaving behind volumes of poetry, essays, criticisms, dramas, novels, linguistics and scientific works, Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe passed away on March 22, 1832 in Weimar.
