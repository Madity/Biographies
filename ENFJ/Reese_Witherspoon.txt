          Laura Jeanne Reese Witherspoon was born on March 22, 1976 at Southern Baptist Hospital (now Memorial Medical Center) in New Orleans, Louisiana. She was the second child born to Dr. John Witherspoon and Betty Reese. Her father was a military surgeon specializing in the ear, nose and throat. Her mother was a Registered Nurse who later became a Ph.D in pediatric nursing. Reese spent the first four years of her life in Wiesbaden, Germany where her father served as a lieutenant colonel in the US Army reserves. Shortly after, John moved the family back to the States, settling in Nashville, Tennessee.Reese was introduced to the entertainment industry at a very early age. At age 7, she began modeling. This led to appearances on several local television commercials. At age 11, she placed first in a Ten-State Talent Fair.In 1990, she landed her first major acting role in Robert Mulligan's The Man in the Moon (1991). Her role as a 14-year old tomboy earned her rave reviews. Roles in bigger films such as Jack the Bear (1993) and A Far Off Place (1993) followed shortly after.Following high school graduation in 1994 from Harpeth Hall, a Nashville all girls school, Reese decided to put her acting career on hold and attend Stanford University where she would major in English literature. However, her collegiate plans were shortly dashed when she accepted roles to star in two major motion pictures: Fear (1996) alongside Mark Wahlberg and Freeway (1996) with Kiefer Sutherland. Although neither film was a huge box-office success, they did help to establish Reese as a rising starlet in Hollywood and open the door for bigger and better film roles. Those bigger roles came in movies such as Pleasantville (1998), Election (1999) and Cruel Intentions (1999).Her breakthrough role came as Elle Woods in the 2001 comedy Legally Blonde (2001). The movie was huge box-office smash and established Reese as one of the top female draws in Hollywood. The next year, she scored a follow-up hit with Sweet Home Alabama (2002) which went on to gross over $100 million dollars at the box office. In 2006, she took home the best actress Oscar for her role as June Carter Cash in the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line (2005). In the late 2000s and early 2010s, Reese continued to star in more romantic comedies such as Four Christmases (2008) and How Do You Know (2010). In December 2010, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.Off the screen, she was married to Ryan Phillippe from 1999 to 2007. They met at her 21st birthday party and subsequently worked together in Cruel Intentions (1999). They have two children: a daughter, Ava Elizabeth (born 9 September 1999) and a son, Deacon (born 23 October 2003). In March 2011, Reese remarried talent agent Jim Toth.
      Shortly after she started acting she had an audition for a role in Cape Fear (1991). She was supposed to meet with Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese for the audition, but at the time didn't really know who they were. On the plane she was talking to the man next to her about her audition, and the man started to rave to her about De Niro and Scorsese. This made her so nervous that she completely blew the audition and the role eventually went to Juliette Lewis.

      [on having a baby]: "Obviously, this isn't the time in my life that I would have chosen to do this, but I feel like life gives you these challenges for a reason. I feel so happy and glad to be in the place that I am. I really feel blessed. This is something I need to face and take control of."
      [talking about how she choose the films she will be in]: "I have a weird process, but the main thing is like this: I hear her voice in my head. There are a lot of wonderful scripts my agents can't believe I pass on, but I do because I can't hear the voice. It doesn't appeal to me then. I'm really careful. Unless I hear the voice, I can't do it."
      [talking about Ryan Phillippe]: "I'm lucky to find a person to share my life, and the best friend I'll ever have."
      [Talking about motherhood and her baby]: "I feel good, I'm proud of Election (1999) and very proud of this [her child]. It couldn't be a better time. It's always the right time when it happens. You make it the right time".
      [talking about Pleasantville (1998)]: "We were thrilled for just the three nominations we got, but obviously it's a little sad. I went through so many press junkets with people saying they loved it. And Joan Allen was robbed but she can't get nominated every year. She's an inspiration for every young actress. She has that calm and reserve about herself and makes you think she appreciates the normal things of everyday. Then she transforms into this character that's so different."
      [talking about the movie business]: "The battles that we face in this business aren't financial, but they are moral. And I certainly think that the longer you can keep your values, and your morality intact, and keep your head on your shoulders about what is important at the end of the day, you can get the most out of this business and really emerge with something wonderful."
      "I grew up in Tennessee. We didn't know what Louis Vuitton was. I had to order all my prom outfits out of catalogs".
      People want to try and move you into a place where you can be easily identifiable by every woman in America - to be this very likable woman in a romantic comedy. And it's really hard for me. I just don't see myself as the girl that everybody likes. I never have been and I don't know how to be that person.
      As far as being in the spotlight and under public scrutiny, a lot of that's about how much you put yourself out there. It's not like we go to every premiere and every celebrity function and every charity auction. We really just try to maintain our privacy and never let our public persona get out of hand.
      I'm not perfect! I'm human. I make mistakes. But I try to be as conscious as I can about things I should be. If I'm going to do something commercial and mainstream and made for the masses, I just believe you can make those kinds of films with quality - and good ideas and good intentions. There's a lot of negativity out there.
      "While making Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde (2003), I had like 50 outfit changes. It was great! I'm real into the whole "girlie" thing, it was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it".
      Attending an all-girls school has its advantages, there are no inhibitions. You can walk to school with your zit cream on and your hair in rollers and nobody cares.
      [on husband Ryan Phillippe] "I don't think I can imagine a better guy than the one I've ended up with".
      There's something timeless and important about making people laugh, about being the right spot in their day. - as quoted in the Dec 7, 2004 issue of Woman's World.
      I was thinking about why I make movies, and I know why. Life is hard. It's nice to go escape and have a good time at the movies. If I can give people a movie about hope, love and the future, then I've done my job.
      I do think things were meant to happen. I'm just this little girl from Tennessee, and here I am today. I think a lot of things are just out of your hands.
      [Asked about the ways she is discriminated against] "I get discriminated against in three ways: I get discriminated against because I'm blond, I get discriminated against because I'm an actress and I get discriminated against because I'm from the South."
      I did. I called my attorney. My agent. My manager. I said "You know y'all, you're serious about this? I'm really.. I gotta get out of this. Like, can't they call LeAnn Rimes? I mean she's good" - On trying to get out of the part of June Carter Cash in Walk the Line (2005).
      The director came to us and he said "No, I really want you guys to learn to sing. To learn to play instruments and I want you to record an album". and that is what... and I just absolutely was just gob-smacked and I said .. "I don't know. I can't do that." And he said "Well I want you to try." Now that's the thing for me. If someone asks me to try, I will always try. - On doing her own singing in Walk the Line (2005).
      Life isn't just about you: It's about family and friends and giving back.quoted in Woman's World magazine 2-21-06.
      About dual careers and marriage: "Marriage and family come before everything. You don't want to make a movie at the cost of your relationship."
      I feel like there's a race being run for some unattainable goal - to be the best, the skinniest, the most beautiful. I just admit that's what I'll never be.
      What gets me is how many women - young women - give up their power and sense of self. Thinking they're going to get more out of life if they take off their clothes and objectify themselves, instead of functioning on the principle that they're smart and capable, that you can be an actress and not be on the covers of T&A magazines. I'm flabbergasted by how many legitimate actresses do that. It blows my mind.
      (Part of Oscar Speech) I am so blessed to have my family here tonight. My mother and my father are here. And I just want to say thank you so much for everything, for being so proud of me. It didn't matter if I was making my bed or making a movie. They never hesitated to say how proud they were of me. And that means so very much to a child. So thank you, Mom and Dad. I want to say thank you to my wonderful husband and my two children who should be going to bed. And thank you for loving me so much and supporting me. And I want to say that, my grandmother was one of the biggest inspirations in my life. She taught me how to be a real woman to have strength and self respect, and to never give those things away. And those are a lot of qualities I saw in June Carter Cash. People used to ask June how she was doing, and she used to say -- 'I'm just trying to matter'. And I know what she means. You know, I'm just trying to matter, and live a good life and make work that means something to somebody. And you have all made me feel that I might have accomplished that tonight. So thank you so much for this honor".
      I think everyone has their own set of problems, and sometimes I feel I'm in the middle of the biggest challenge of my life just trying to maintain normalcy in a kind of crazy lifestyle.
      I'm pretty conservative or old-fashion, I should say, it's how I grew up. I think you have to let your children be individuals, but you have to set boundaries. Ryan and I have similar ideas about all of it, you really have to support you partner in the things that are important to them and hold the line together.
      Many people worry so much about managing their careers, but rarely spend half that much energy managing their lives. I want to make my life, not just my job, the best it can be. The rest will work itself out.
      I have cellulite. I have stretch marks. I feel intimidated by Victoria's Secret. Hollywood is one of those endless competitions, but it's like running a race toward nothing. There's no winning. You're never going to win the pretty race. I just want to be the best version of myself that I can be.
      I feel like there's a race being run in Los Angeles for some unattainable goal -to be the best, the skinniest, the most beautiful. I just admit that that's what I'll never be. (Marie Claire - September 2005)
      I don't think these women are stupid. I think they're selling a personality that's very marketable: Wouldn't it be fun if we were all gorgeous and didn't have a care? But creating a cultural icon out of someone who goes, "I'm stupid, isn't it cute?" makes me want to throw daggers at them! I want to say to them, "My grandma did not fight for what she fought for, and my mother did not fight for what she fought for, so you can start telling women it's fun to be stupid." Saying that to young women, little girls, my daughter? It's not OK. (Marie Claire - September 2005)
      I feel there are certain people who are systematically ripping [feminism] down because of their lack of regard and their ignorance about what the women before us had to go through. (Marie Claire - September 2005)
      What gets me is how many women - young women - give up their power and their sense of self. Thinking they're going to get more out of life if they take off their clothes and objectify themselves, instead of functioning on the principle that they're smart and capable, that you can be an actress and not be on the covers of T&A magazines. I'm flabbergasted by how many legitimate actresses do that. It blows my mind. (Marie Claire - September 2005)
      I'm wary of what goal I set, because then I'll have to accomplish it. (Vanity Fair - September 2004 - "Regally Blonde" by Leslie Bennett).
      Since when is self-improvement a negative? Why wouldn't I be interested in psychology? I like to read a lot of psychology books. I'm obsessed with child behavior; I would love to be a child psychologist. [on being criticized after admitting she and then-husband Ryan Phillippe have gone to couples therapy] (Vanity Fair - September 2004 - "Regally Blonde" by Leslie Bennett).
      I've learned the art of ignoring people. When people give you some piece of direction you don't like, you just nod and ignore it. Just don't do it! Most people want to be heard and acknowledged, anyway. Just do what you want to do. [on how she handles people who disagree with her] (Vanity Fair - September 2004 - "Regally Blonde" by Leslie Bennett).
      Even now, people want to marginalize me. They want to attribute all my success to teenagers seeing my movies. I really resent it when people say, "It's just a genre film; it's a teen comedy". It takes a lot of work to make these things have heart and resonance so they're not just empty, disposable confections. But I don't give a damn about other people's perceptions, because I'll show them. For women in this business, ascendancy is always a battle. It's scrape and claw. I just try to stick to my guns and respect myself. I want to take the ingénues aside and say, "Value yourself! It's O.K. if you have opinions!" [on struggling to be taken seriously in the industry] (Vanity Fair - September 2004 - "Regally Blonde" by Leslie Bennett).
      They want people they can push around. I was the girl who was always asking, "Why? Yeah, I know you want me to do that - but why?" I always thought people wanted to hear my opinions. [Grins] But I gave them anyway. It's just blind self-confidence. I get like a little terrier about things. My mother says I should have been an attorney [on asserting herself, even with her employers] (Vanity Fair - September 2004 - "Regally Blonde" by Leslie Bennett).
      It's one of those endless competitions, but it's like running a race toward nothing. "There's no winning. You're never going to win the thin race. You're never going to win the pretty race. You're never going to win the smart race. You're never going to win the funny race. I just want to be the best version of myself I can be [About the harsh standards placed on women by Hollywood] (Vanity Fair - September 2004 - "Regally Blonde" by Leslie Bennett).
      I like work. If it's not hard enough, I try to make it harder. I like the process of being daunted by it, tackling it, and knowing I can do it (Vanity Fair - September 2004 - "Regally Blonde" by Leslie Bennett).
      {On roles resembling the title character in Penelope (2006)] I like this girl because she is a bit of a bad-ass. I grew up watching movies with people like Barbara Stanwyck and, sometimes, I get frustrated that there aren't a lot of great female characters out there that young women can look at and go, 'I want to be like that'. I go to movies and yell at the women on-screen, 'Shoot him; just shoot him'. I mean, why why does the guy always have to shoot him?
      There's always going to be somebody younger or sexier. That's why I like to say, and it's become my famous line, "Funny doesn't sag."
      [on storing her Oscar] I have it out [at home] with the kids artwork... I think it's great when they hold it and dress it up.
      When a police officer tells you to stay in the car, you stay in the car. I learned that for sure.
      I clearly had one drink too many and I am deeply embarrassed about the things I said. It was definitely a scary situation and I was frightened for my husband, but that is no excuse. I was disrespectful to the officer who was just doing his job. I have nothing but respect for the police and I'm very sorry for my behavior.

Laura Jeanne Reese Witherspoon (born March 22, 1976), professionally known as Reese Witherspoon, is an American actress and producer.[2] Witherspoon landed her first feature role as the female lead in the film The Man in the Moon in 1991. In 1996, she appeared in Freeway, and starred in Pleasantville in 1998. For her role in 1999's Election, she earned a Golden Globe nomination.
2001 marked her career's turning point with the breakout role as Elle Woods in the box-office hit Legally Blonde, and in 2002 she starred in Sweet Home Alabama, which became her biggest commercial film success to date. 2003 saw her return as lead actress and executive producer of Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde. In 2005, Witherspoon received worldwide attention and praise for her portrayal of June Carter Cash in Walk the Line, which earned her an Academy Award, Golden Globe, BAFTA, and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.
In 1999, she married actor Ryan Phillippe; the couple separated in late 2006 and divorced in October 2007. In 2011, she married talent agent Jim Toth. Witherspoon owns a production company, Pacific Standard, and she is actively involved in children's and women's advocacy organizations. She serves on the board of the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) and was named Global Ambassador of Avon Products in 2007, serving as honorary chair of the charitable Avon Foundation. On December 1, 2010, Witherspoon received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Witherspoon was born at Southern Baptist Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana, while her father, John Draper Witherspoon Sr., was a student at Tulane University medical school.[3][4] Her father is a Georgia-born otolaryngologist who previously served as a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army Reserve.[5][6] Her mother, Mary Elizabeth "Betty" (née Reese), is from Harriman, Tennessee, has a Ph.D. in pediatric nursing, and works as a professor of nursing at Vanderbilt University.[6][7][8] Witherspoon has claimed descent from Scottish-born John Witherspoon, who signed the United States Declaration of Independence;[9][10] this claim has not been verified by the Society of the Descendants of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence genealogists.[11] Because Witherspoon's father worked for the U.S. military in Wiesbaden, Germany, she lived there for four years as a child.[7][12] After returning to the U.S., she spent her childhood in Nashville, Tennessee.[7][12][13] She was raised as an Episcopalian.[14]
At the age of seven, Witherspoon was selected as a fashion model for a florist's television advertisements, which motivated her to take acting lessons.[15][16] At age eleven, she took first place in the Ten-State Talent Fair.[15] She received good grades in school;[15] she loved reading and considered herself "a big dork who read loads of books."[4] On mentioning her love for books, she said, "I get crazy in a bookstore. It makes my heart beat hard because I want to buy everything."[14] Witherspoon attended middle school at Harding Academy and graduated from the all-girls' Harpeth Hall School in Nashville, during which time she was a cheerleader.[17][18] She attended Stanford University as an English literature major.[19] After completing one year of studies, she left Stanford to pursue an acting career.[18]
Witherspoon is proud of the "definitive Southern upbringing" which she received. She has said that it gave her "a sense of family and tradition" and taught her about "being conscientious about people's feelings, being polite, being responsible and never taking for granted what you have in your life."[18][20] Witherspoon is described as a "multi-achiever" and was given the nickname "Little Type A" by her parents.[21][22] On discussing her early achievements, she told Interview magazine, "I just don't see any of it as that remarkable. Maybe that's the attitude I choose to have to keep me sane and keep my feet on the ground. I grew up in an environment where women accomplished a lot. And if they weren't able to, it was because they were limited by society."[6]
In 1990, Witherspoon attended an open casting call for The Man in the Moon intending to audition as a bit player;[18] she was instead cast for the lead role of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old country girl who falls in love for the first time with her 17-year-old neighbor. Her performance was regarded as "memorably touching" by Variety magazine,[23] and critic Roger Ebert commented, "Her first kiss is one of the most perfect little scenes I've ever seen in a movie."[15] For this role, Witherspoon was nominated for the Young Artist Award Best Young Actress.[24] Later that year, she made her TV acting debut in the cable movie Wildflower, directed by Diane Keaton and starring Patricia Arquette.[5][9] In 1992, Witherspoon appeared in the TV movie Desperate Choices: To Save My Child, portraying a critically ill young girl.[5] In 1993, she played a young wife in the CBS miniseries Return to Lonesome Dove and got a starring role as the leading character Nonnie Parker, a South African girl who must cross 1,250 miles (2,000 km) of the Kalahari, in the teen-aimed Disney film A Far Off Place.[5] In the same year, Witherspoon had a minor role in Jack the Bear, which garnered her the Young Artist Award for Best Youth Actress Co-star.[25] The next year, Witherspoon had another leading role as Wendy Pfister in the 1994 film S.F.W., directed by Jefery Levy.
In 1996, Witherspoon starred in two major films, the thriller Fear alongside Mark Wahlberg (whom she dated)[26] as Nicole Walker, a teenage girl with a handsome boyfriend who turns out to be a violent psychopath, and had the lead role in black-comedy thriller Freeway, alongside Kiefer Sutherland and Brooke Shields. Her character, Vanessa Lutz, is a poor girl living in Los Angeles, who encounters a freeway serial killer on the way to her grandmother's home in Stockton.[18] The film received positive reviews from the press. Among them was the San Francisco Chronicle, with Mick LaSalle commenting, "Witherspoon, who does a shrill Texas accent, is dazzling, utterly believable in one extreme situation after the other."[27] Witherspoon's performance won her the Best Actress Award at the Cognac Police Film Festival and firmly established her as a rising star.[18][28] The making of the movie also gave Witherspoon significant acting experience; as she said, "Once I overcame the hurdle of that movie – which scared me to death – I felt like I could try anything."[19] Following completion of Freeway in 1997, Witherspoon took a break from acting in major movies for a year and began dating actor Ryan Phillippe. She returned to the screen in 1998 with major roles in three movies: Overnight Delivery, Pleasantville, and Twilight.[9][29] In Pleasantville she starred alongside Tobey Maguire in a tale about 1990s teenage siblings who are magically transported into the setting of a 1950s television series. She portrayed the sister, Jennifer, who is mainly concerned about appearances, relationships, and popularity. Her performance received good reviews and garnered her the Young Hollywood Award for Best Female Breakthrough Performance.[30] Director Gary Ross said he firmly believed Witherspoon would be an outstanding movie star.[19]
In 1999, Witherspoon starred alongside Alessandro Nivola in the drama thriller Best Laid Plans; she played Lissa, a woman who schemes with her lover Nick to escape a small dead-end town.[5] Also that year co-starred with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe in the drama film Cruel Intentions, a modern take on the 18th-century French novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses. The San Francisco Chronicle praised her performance as Annette Hargrove: "Witherspoon is especially good in the least flashy role, and even when called upon to make a series of cute devilish faces, she pulls it off."[31] She also appeared in a music video by Marcy Playground for the film's soundtrack. Then she starred with Matthew Broderick in the film adaptation of Tom Perrotta's 1998 novel Election.[5] For her portrayal of competitive, ambitious overachiever Tracy Flick in her race for student-body president, she received vast critical acclaim and won the Best Actress Award from the National Society of Film Critics and the Online Film Critics Society, a first Golden Globe nomination and an Independent Spirit Award nomination.[32][33] Witherspoon also received a rank on the list of 100 Greatest Film Performances of All Time by Premiere.[34] Director Alexander Payne said of her, "She's got that quality that men find attractive, while women would like to be her friend. But that's just the foundation. Nobody else is as funny or brings such charm to things. She can do anything."[20] In spite of her successful performance, Witherspoon noted in an interview that she struggled to find work after completing the film, due to typecasting.[35] Analyzing the reasons behind her difficulty to find work, Witherspoon commented, "I think because the character I played was so extreme and sort of shrewish—people thought that was who I was, rather than me going in and creating a part. I would audition for things and I'd always be the second choice—studios never wanted to hire me and I wasn't losing the parts to big box office actresses but to ones who I guess people felt differently about."[6]
In 2000, Witherspoon played a supporting role in American Psycho and made a cameo appearance in Little Nicky.[29] She also guest starred in season six of Friends as Rachel Green's sister Jill.[36] The next year, Witherspoon voiced Serena in the animated film The Trumpet of the Swan, produced by Crest Animation Productions.
The 2001 film Legally Blonde marked a turning point in Witherspoon's career; she starred as Elle Woods, a fashion-merchandising major who decides to become a law student in order to follow her ex-boyfriend to Harvard Law School. Witherspoon said about the role, "When I read Legally Blonde, I was like, 'She's from Beverly Hills, she's rich, she's in a sorority. She has a great boyfriend. Oh yeah, she gets dumped. Who cares? I still hate her.' So we had to make sure she was the kind of person you just can't hate."[20] Legally Blonde was a box-office hit, grossing US$96 million domestically.[37] Witherspoon's performance earned her praise from critics, as the press began referring to her as "the new Meg Ryan".[38] Roger Ebert commented, "Witherspoon effortlessly animated this material with sunshine and quick wit",[39] and Salon.com noted that "she [Witherspoon] delineates Elle's character beautifully".[40] Meanwhile, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer concluded, "Witherspoon is a talented comedian who can perk up a scene just by marching in full of pep and drive and she powers this modest little comedy almost single-handedly."[41] For her work, Witherspoon garnered her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.
In 2002, after the success of Legally Blonde, Witherspoon starred in several roles, such as Greta Wolfcastle in The Simpsons episode "The Bart Wants What It Wants", as Cecily in the comedy The Importance of Being Earnest, a film adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play in which she received a Teen Choice Award nomination.[42][43] Later that year, she starred with Josh Lucas and Patrick Dempsey in Andy Tennant's film Sweet Home Alabama, where she played Melanie Carmichael, a young fashion designer who intends to marry a New York politician but must return to Alabama to divorce her childhood sweetheart, from whom she has been separated for seven years. Witherspoon regarded this as a "personal role", in that it reminded her of experiences she had when she moved from her hometown Nashville to Los Angeles.[44] The movie became Witherspoon's biggest box office hit to date, earning over $35 million in the opening weekend and grossing over $127 million in the U.S.[37][45] Despite the commercial success, critics gave Sweet Home Alabama negative reviews. It was called "a romantic comedy so rote, dull and predictable" by The Miami Herald,[46] and the press widely agreed that Witherspoon was the only reason the movie attracted such a large audience.[47][48] When describing Witherspoon's role in the movie, The Christian Science Monitor concluded, "She is not the movie's main attraction, she is its only attraction."[49]
In 2003, Witherspoon followed up the success of Legally Blonde by starring in the sequel Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde. Elle Woods has become a Harvard-educated lawyer who is determined to protect animals from cosmetics-industry science tests. The sequel was not as financially successful as the first movie and it generated mostly critical reviews. USA Today considered the movie "plodding, unfunny and almost cringe-worthy", but also noted that "Reese Witherspoon still does a fine job portraying the fair-haired lovable brainiac, but her top-notch comic timing is wasted on the humorless dialogue."[50] Meanwhile, Salon.com concluded that the sequel "calcifies everything that was enjoyable about the first movie".[51] Despite being panned by critics, the sequel took in over $39 million in its first five days in the U.S. box office charts and eventually grossed $90 million in the US.[52] Witherspoon received a $15 million paycheck for the role—a starting point to make her consistently one of Hollywood's highest-paid actresses from 2002 until 2010.[20][53][54][55]
In 2004, Witherspoon starred in Vanity Fair, adapted from the 19th-century classic novel Vanity Fair and directed by Mira Nair. Her character, Becky Sharp, is a woman whose impoverished childhood gives her a ruthless determination to find fortune and establish herself a position in society. Witherspoon was carefully costumed to conceal that during the filming she was pregnant with her second child.[56] This pregnancy was not a hindrance to her work as Witherspoon believed the gestation had in fact helped her portrayal of Sharp's character: "I love the luminosity that pregnancy brings, I love the fleshiness, I love the ample bosom—it gave me much more to play with", she said.[57][58] The film and Witherspoon's portrayal of Sharp received positive reviews, as The Hollywood Reporter wrote, "Nair's cast is splendid. Witherspoon does justice to the juicy role by giving the part more buoyancy than naughtiness."[59] At the same time, The Charlotte Observer called her work "an excellent performance that's soft around the edges" and the Los Angeles Times concluded that Becky is "a part Reese Witherspoon was born to play".[60][61]
In late 2004, Witherspoon began working alongside Mark Ruffalo on the romantic comedy Just Like Heaven. Her character, Elizabeth Masterson, is an ambitious young doctor who gets into a car accident on her way to a blind date and is left in a coma; her spirit returns to her old apartment where she later finds true love.[62]
Earlier that year Witherspoon was chosen to portray June Carter Cash, the second wife of country-music singer and songwriter Johnny Cash, in Walk the Line. She never had the chance to meet Carter Cash, as Witherspoon was filming Vanity Fair at the time Carter Cash died.[6] Witherspoon performed her own vocals in the film and her songs had to be performed in front of a live audience, she was so worried about needing to perform live that she asked her lawyer to terminate the film contract.[63] "That was the most challenging part of the role," she later recalled in an interview, "I'd never sung professionally."[64] Subsequently, she had to spend six months learning how to sing for the role.[63][65] Witherspoon's portrayal of Carter Cash was well received by critics, and Roger Ebert wrote that her performance added "boundless energy" to the movie.[66] She won several awards for her performance, including the Golden Globe Award, the Screen Actors Guild, the BAFTA and the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Lead Role.
Besides critical success in the movie industry, Witherspoon and her Walk the Line co-star Joaquin Phoenix received a nomination for "collaborative video of the year" from the CMT Music Awards.[67][68] Witherspoon expressed her passion for the movie: "I really like in this film that it is realistic and portrays sort of a real marriage, a real relationship where there are forbidden thoughts and fallibility. And it is about compassion in the long haul, not just the short easy solutions to problems."[69] She also stated that she believed Carter Cash was a woman ahead of her time: "I think the really remarkable thing about her character is that she did all of these things that we sort of see as normal things in the 1950s when it wasn't really acceptable for a woman to be married and divorced twice and have two different children by two different husbands and travel around in a car full of very famous musicians all by herself. She didn't try to comply to social convention, so I think that makes her a very modern woman."[69]
Witherspoon's first post-Oscar role came in the modern-day fairy tale Penelope, as Annie, the best friend of Penelope (Christina Ricci), a girl who has a curse in her family. The film was produced by her company Type A Films and premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival.[63][70] After the final release date of Penelope was delayed twice, the movie eventually had a February 2008 release.[71][72]
Witherspoon was back in front of the camera in November 2006 as shooting began for the political thriller Rendition. She starred alongside Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin, Peter Sarsgaard, and Jake Gyllenhaal, playing Isabella El-Ibrahim, the pregnant wife of a bombing suspect. Rendition was released in October 2007 and marked Witherspoon's first appearance in theaters since the 2005 release of Walk the Line.[73] The movie received mostly negative reviews and was generally considered a disappointment at the Toronto Film Festival.[74] Witherspoon's performance was also criticized: "Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly lifeless", USA Today wrote, "She customarily injects energy and spirit into her parts, but here, her performance feels tamped down."[75] In December 2007, Witherspoon began working with Vince Vaughn, filming the holiday comedy Four Christmases, a story about a couple who must spend their Christmas Day trying to visit all four of their divorced parents.[76] The film was released in November 2008. Despite only receiving average reviews by critics, the movie became a box-office success, earning more than 120 million US dollars domestically and US$157m worldwide.[77] Witherspoon next provided the voice of Susan Murphy, the main character in DreamWorks' computer-animated 3-D feature film Monsters vs. Aliens, released in March 2009.[78] In 2009, she also produced the Legally Blonde spin-off Legally Blondes, starring Milly and Becky Rosso.
With the exception of her animated role in Monsters vs. Aliens, Witherspoon did not appear in a live-action film for two years after the release of Four Christmases. Witherspoon told Entertainment Weekly that the "break" was unplanned, stating that, "I just didn't read anything I liked...There are a lot of really, really, really big movies about robots and things—and there's not a part for a 34-year-old woman in a robot movie."[79] Witherspoon returned with three films in 2010, 2011, and 2012, all centered around Witherspoon as a woman caught in a love triangle between two men. In an interview with MTV, Witherspoon jokingly referred to this trio of films as her "love triangle period".[80]
The first film was James L. Brooks's romantic comedy How Do You Know,[81][82][83] which starred Witherspoon as a thirty-something former national softball player who struggles to choose between a philandering baseball star boyfriend (Owen Wilson) and a business executive being investigated for white-collar crime (Paul Rudd). The movie was filmed in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. over the summer and fall of 2009[84][85][86] and released on December 17, 2010. The movie was both a critical and box office failure. Despite an over-$100 million budget, the film earned only $7.6 million in its opening weekend, leading the Los Angeles Times to call it "one of the year's biggest flops".[87] The movie earned mainly negative reviews from critics, scoring 35% on Rotten Tomatoes with 111 reviews as of late December 2010.[88]
Witherspoon's second consecutive love-triangle movie was the film adaptation of the 1930s circus drama Water for Elephants. Witherspoon began circus training in March 2010 for her role as Marlena, a glamorous performer stuck in a marriage to a volatile husband (Christoph Waltz) but intrigued by the circus's new veterinarian (Robert Pattinson).[89] The movie was filmed between late May and early August 2010[90][91] in various locations in Tennessee, Georgia, and California. It was released on April 22, 2011 [92] and received mixed critical reviews,[93] but was a modest box office success.[94]
In September 2010, Witherspoon began principal photography in Vancouver for the third love-triangle film, This Means War, a 20th Century Fox spy comedy directed by McG in which Witherspoon's character is at the center of a battle between best friends (played by Chris Pine and Tom Hardy) who are both in love with her. The film had a "sneak-peak" release on Valentine's Day, before fully opening on February 17, 2012.[95][96][97][98][99] The film was panned by critics (with a 25% Rotten Tomatoes rating),[100] and fared poorly at the box office, taking fifth place on its opening weekend with sales of $17.6 million. The New York Times remarked that this "extended the box office cold streak for the Oscar-winning Ms. Witherspoon."[101]
Witherspoon's subsequent films signaled a departure from the love-triangle theme. In September 2011, nearly a year after beginning work on This Means War, she began filming Jeff Nichols's coming-of-age drama Mud in Arkansas, in which she played Juniper, the former girlfriend of a fugitive (Matthew McConaughey), who enlists two local boys to help him evade capture and rekindle his romance with her.[102][103] Mud premiered in May 2012 in competition for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, but did not win.[104][105] Following its American debut at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2013,[106] the film had a limited release in selected North American theaters on April 26, 2013.[107][108]
Witherspoon's next film to be released was Atom Egoyan's Devil's Knot an adaptation of the true crime book of the same-name, which examines the controversial case of the West Memphis Three. Like Mud, the story is set in Arkansas. Witherspoon played Pam Hobbs, the mother of one of three young murder victims. In an interview subsequent to her casting in the film, Egoyan noted that although the role requires "an emotionally loaded journey", he "met with Reese, and...talked at length about the project, and she's eager to take on the challenge".[109] The movie was shot in Georgia in June and July 2012.[110][111][112] Witherspoon was pregnant with her third child during filming.[113][114] The movie's world premiere was held on September 8, 2013 at the Toronto International Film Festival.[115][116] It was then released in selected American theaters on May 9, 2014.[117]
In April 2013, Witherspoon began production in Atlanta on Canadian director Philippe Falardeau's upcoming The Good Lie. The film, which is based on real-life events, will feature Witherspoon as a brash American woman assigned to help four young Sudanese refugees (known as Lost Boys of Sudan) who win a lottery for relocation to the United States.[118][119]
Witherspoon subsequently shot a small role in Inherent Vice, an adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's detective novel, in Pasadena, California in summer 2013.[120][121] In September 2013, production began on the film adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel Gone Girl,[122] for which Witherspoon is serving as a producer through her company Pacific Standard, though she will not appear in the film (set for a fall 2014 release).[123][124] In October 2013, Witherspoon began working in Oregon on another adaptation which she is producing via Pacific Standard, that of Cheryl Strayed's memoir Wild.[125] Witherspoon stars in this project, portraying Strayed herself on her 1000 mile hike along the Pacific Crest Trail.[126] Wild will be released in select theaters on December 5, 2014.[127]
Numerous other upcoming projects have been announced, including the Disney film Wish List, to be written by Glenn Berger and Jonathan Aibel and directed by Bridesmaids helmer Paul Feig,[128] (although Witherspoon is set to produce the film that she will not be starring)[129] and an adaptation of the self-help book, Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus.[130] Witherspoon is set to jointly star in and produce a number of additional movies under her Pacific Standard banner, including the comedy-drama Rule #1,[131] a film version of upcoming children's book series Pennyroyal's Princess Boot Camp[132] and the comedy The Beard.[133]
On December 1, 2010, Witherspoon received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6262 Hollywood Blvd.[134]
Witherspoon owned a production company called Type A Films, which the media believed was a moniker honoring her childhood nickname "Little Miss Type A."[21][135] However, when asked about the company by Interview magazine, she clarified the name's origin: "... people think I named it after myself ... It was actually an in-joke with my family because at [age] 7 I understood complicated medical terms, such as the difference between type A and type B personalities. But I just wished I'd named the company Dogfood Films or Fork or something. You carry that baggage all your life."[6]
In March 2012, Witherspoon merged Type A Films with producer Bruna Panadrea's Make Movies banner to create a new production company entitled Pacific Standard.[136] In 2013, Witherspoon recorded a cover of the classic Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra duet, "Somethin' Stupid" with Michael Bublé for his 2013 album, To Be Loved.[137]
In March 2014, it was reported that Witherspoon is in the process of forming a lifestyle company with former C. Wonder president Andrea Hyde serving as president.[138] The company, Draper James, will aim to open a retail store in 2015, selling a variety of goods including bed and bath products, cosmetics, stationery, and kitchenware.[139]
Witherspoon is actively involved in children's and women's advocacy organizations. She is a longtime supporter of Save the Children, an organization that helps provide children around the world with education, health care and emergency aid.[140] She also serves on the board of the Children's Defense Fund, a child advocacy and research group.[140] In 2006, she was among a group of actresses who went to New Orleans, Louisiana in a CDF project to publicize the needs of Hurricane Katrina victims.[141] In this trip, she helped open the city's first Freedom School, as she met and talked with the children.[142] Witherspoon later called this an experience that she would never forget.[142]
In 2007, Witherspoon made her first move into the world of endorsements, as she signed a multi-year agreement to serve as the first Global Ambassador of cosmetic company Avon Products.[140][143] She acts as a spokeswoman for Avon's cosmetic products and serves as the honorary chair of the Avon Foundation, a charitable organization that supports women and focuses on breast cancer research and the prevention of domestic violence.[144][145] Witherspoon is also committed to participating in cosmetics product development and appearing in commercial advertisements.[144] Explaining her motives for joining the foundation, she said, "As a woman and a mother I care deeply about the well being of other women and children throughout the world and through the years, I have always looked for opportunities to make a difference."[144]
Witherspoon hosted Saturday Night Live on September 29, 2001, the first episode to air after New York City was devastated by the destruction of the World Trade Center on September 11.[146] In 2005, she was ranked No. 5 in Teen People magazine's list of most powerful young Hollywood actors.[147] In 2006, Witherspoon was listed among the Time 100.[148] Her featured article was written by Luke Wilson.[149] In the same year, she was selected as one of the "100 Sexiest Women In The World" by the readers of FHM.[150] Witherspoon has appeared on the annual Celebrity 100 list by Forbes magazine in 2006 and 2007, at No. 75 and No. 80, respectively.[151][152] Forbes also put her on the top ten Trustworthy Celebrities list.[153] She was listed among CEOWORLD magazine's Top Accomplished Women Entertainers.[154]
In 2006, Star fabricated a story saying Witherspoon was pregnant with her third child, which led to Witherspoon suing the magazine's parent company American Media Inc in Los Angeles Superior Court for privacy violation.[155] She sought unspecified general and punitive damages in the lawsuit, asserting that the claim harmed her reputation because it suggested she was hiding the news from producers of her upcoming films.[156]
Witherspoon has been featured four times in the annual "100 Most Beautiful" issues of People magazine.[157] In 2007, she was selected by People and the entertainment news program Access Hollywood as one of the year's best-dressed female stars.[158][159] The yellow dress she wore to that year's Golden Globe Awards was widely acclaimed.[160] A study conducted by E-Poll Market Research showed that Witherspoon was the most likable female celebrity of 2007.[161] That same year, Witherspoon established herself as the highest-paid actress in the American film industry, earning $15 to $20 million per film.[162][163] In recent years, however, her appearance in a number of movies that fared badly at the box office caused a turnabout in her status and she has been noted as one of the most overpaid actors in Hollywood in 2011, 2012 and 2013.[164][165][166]
Witherspoon met actor Ryan Phillippe at her 21st birthday party in March 1997.[168][169] They became engaged in December 1998[170] and married near Charleston, South Carolina on June 5, 1999, at Old Wide Awake Plantation.[171][172][173] They have two children: a daughter, Ava Elizabeth Phillippe, born September 9, 1999,[174] and a son, Deacon Reese Phillippe, born October 23, 2003.[171] In October 2006, Witherspoon and Phillippe announced that they had decided to separate formally after seven years of marriage. The following month, Witherspoon filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.[175] In her petition, she sought joint legal and sole physical custody of their two children, with full visitation rights for Phillippe.[175][176] With no prenuptial agreement, Witherspoon and Phillippe would be entitled to half of all assets gained during the marriage under California law, with Witherspoon's being the more significant.[177][178] Witherspoon requested that the court grant no spousal support for Phillippe, and he did not contest.[175] On May 15, 2007, Phillippe filed for joint physical custody of their children and made no motion to block Witherspoon from seeking support from him.[179] Witherspoon and Phillippe's final divorce documents were granted by the Los Angeles Superior Court on October 5, 2007.[180][181]
Throughout 2007, there was persistent speculation in the mass media about a romantic relationship between Witherspoon and her Rendition co-star Jake Gyllenhaal. After her divorce was finalized in October 2007, Witherspoon and Gyllenhaal became more open about their relationship, mainly due to the release of paparazzi pictures of them vacationing together in Rome.[182] They reportedly broke up in December 2009.[183]
In early February 2010, it was reported that Witherspoon had begun dating Jim Toth,[184][185][186] a talent agent and co-head of motion picture talent at the Creative Artists Agency, where Witherspoon is a client.[187] Witherspoon and Toth announced their engagement in December 2010,[188] and married on March 26, 2011 in Ojai, California at Libbey Ranch,[189] Witherspoon's country estate (which she has since sold).[190][191] Their son, Tennessee James Toth, was born on September 27, 2012.[192]
Early in the morning of April 19, 2013, while in Atlanta filming The Good Lie, Witherspoon and Toth (as well as an unnamed third passenger) were pulled over after the car in which they were traveling was seen weaving across a double line on Peachtree Street.[193] Toth, who was driving, was found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.139 and was arrested and charged with driving under the influence and failing to maintain a lane.[193] Witherspoon was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for disobeying the arresting officer's instructions to remain in the vehicle and arguing with him, saying that she did not believe he was a real police officer and asking if he knew who she was.[193][194] The couple was released on bond at 3:30 AM the same day.[195] Witherspoon was able to attend the New York premiere of her film Mud on April 21,[196] and she issued an apology later that night, stating that she had "clearly had one drink too many" and was "deeply embarrassed about the things I said...I was disrespectful to the officer who was just doing his job. I have nothing but respect for the police and I’m very sorry for my behavior."[197] When Witherspoon's lawyer and her husband appeared in court on May 2, Toth pleaded guilty and was ordered to complete 40 hours of community service, an alcohol-education program, and one year of probation; Witherspoon pleaded no contest and was fined $213.[198]

=======================================================
Laura Jeanne Reese Witherspoon was the second child born to John, a military surgeon specialising in ear, nose and throat operations, and Betty Reese, a registered nurse.
For the first four years of her life, Witherspoon lived in Germany due to her father’s military posting there before the whole family eventually returned to the United States to settle in Nashville, Tennessee.
Like many of her fellow Hollywood co-stars, Witherspoon began modelling at a mere seven-years-old. This led to television commercial roles before she landed her first significant acting part in ‘The Man in the Moon’ in 1990 as a 14-year-old tomboy. Roles in the films ‘Jack The Bear’ (1993) and Disney’s ‘A Far Off Place’ (1993) followed.
After graduating from a private all girls' school in 1994, Witherspoon decided to halt her acting career temporarily to attend Stanford University. Her intentions were short lived though as after just a year of studying, Witherspoon left to continue with her true ambitions on the acting path.
Taking the lead role of Wendy Pfister in the 1994 film, ‘SFW’, Witherspoon’s real break came when she starred alongside brat pack favourite, Kiefer Sutherland and Brooke Shields in the thriller ‘Freeway’ (1996). Her part earned Witherspoon a Best Actress award at the Cognac Festival du Film Project - the first time the industry had taken notice of the young actress’s talents. The same year she also starred with Mark Wahlberg in the film ‘Fear’.
1998 was a breakthrough year for Witherspoon, making three films, of which two in particular were stand-out parts.
Witherspoon was first seen portraying the wayward daughter of Susan Sarandon and Gene Hackman in ‘Twilight’, then taking a less notable role in ‘Overnight Delivery’ before finally meeting a milestone in her career in Gary Ross’s black and white 1959s drama, ‘Pleasantville’.
Witherspoon’s role as the kooky Jennifer earned her the Best Female Breakthrough Performance recognition at the Young Hollywood awards and immediately caught the critics’ attentions.
Witherspoon continued her climb up the success ladder in 1999 by playing the part of Alessandro Nivola’s lover in ‘Best Laid Plans’.
Witherspoon’s role of Tracey Flick in the dark satire ‘Election’ (1999) opposite Matthew Broderick was well received by the critics. Playing a fiercely ambitious high school president candidate, the part led to her first Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress.
Witherspoon climaxed her roles of 1999 with a film she’s still most widely recognised for by many fans – ‘Cruel Intentions’. The remake of the French ‘Les Liaisons Dangereuses’ drew a large box office audience with Witherspoon marking herself as a teen role model alongside pin-ups Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe.
Witherspoon’s role in Cruel Intentions was significant for personal reasons as it was on set that love finally blossomed between her and co-star Ryan Phillppe. The couple had in fact met in 1997 at Witherspoon’s 21st birthday party and got engaged the following year. After the success of Cruel Intentions though, the pair married and their first child, Ava was born soon after in September 1999.
In 2000, Witherspoon’s profile was raised further when she took a guest part on the hit TV show ‘Friends’ as Rachel’s little sister, Jill Greene. Driven by a desire to produce quality movies for young women, Witherspoon teamed up with Debra Siegel to launch a new film production company in 2000 named Type A Films. However, other than a small cameo appearance alongside Adam Sandler in ‘Little Nicky’ (2000) and a supporting role in ‘American Psycho’ (2000), Witherspoon had a relatively quiet start to the millennium to deliberately concentrate on her private life.
2001 secured Witherspoon’s earning potential with the box office smash ‘Legally Blonde’. Starring as Elle Woods, a fashion merchandising executive who becomes a law student in order to follow her ex boyfriend to Harvard, the comedy was an instant hit thanks to Witherspoon’s irresistible performance. The role also earned Witherspoon her second Best Actress Golden Globe nomination.
The relatively small success of Oscar Wilde’s ‘The Importance of Being Earnest’ in 2002 didn’t immediately follow the audience enthusiasm of Legally Blonde’s appeal yet Witherspoon’s next film of the same year, ‘Sweet Home Alabama’ made up for it. The romantic comedy was particularly close to Witherspoon’s heart because the plot centered around a Southern girl who after transforming herself into a New York socialite has second thoughts about her true roots when she’s on a visit back to her home.
A self identified Southerner; Witherspoon has always credited her family with establishing in her a sense of constancy that reflected in her own parental philosophy. “This whole LA culture is foreign to me because when I was growing up you wouldn’t watch your children every moment. I think part of the joy of being a child is privacy. Your fantasies and dreams are so important to you at that moment.”
The success of Legally Blonde in 2001 was followed in 2003 with its sequel ‘Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde’, which was a box office smash paralleling the success of its original. Witherspoon also gave birth to her second child, Deacon, in October of the same year.
Switching from the tried and tested winning formula of comedic acting, Witherspoon took on the role of elitist Becky Sharpe in Mira Nair’s modern style adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray’s novel ‘Vanity Fair’ (2004). The film was a moderate success but at this stage Witherspoon had already established herself as one of Hollywood’s highest earning female actresses, reportedly earning an average of $15 million per film role.
2005 was to be a landmark year in Witherspoon’s life. After completing the romantic comedy ‘Just Like Heaven’, in which she starred with Mark Ruffalo in a plot similar to 1990’s mega hit ‘Ghost’, Witherspoon filmed the part of June Carter Cash in the Johnny Cash biopic, ‘Walk The Line’. This project was potentially the most challenging of Witherspoon’s career to date - starring alongside Joaquin Phoenix, she was required to sing Carter’s songs, learn to play the autoharp and pull off a convincing portrayal of Carter’s trademark wisecracks and renowned character traits.
Witherspoon’s efforts came to fruition as not only did she win a Golden Globe for Best Actress and a Screen Actors Guild award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor, she topped off her run of success with the ultimate accolade, an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.
Although topping up the phenomenal success of 'Walk The Line' would always be a challenge, she highlighted her determination to maintain the good form by gaining a Teen Choice Award nomination for her role in 2007's ‘Rendition’, where she played Isabella Fields El-Ibrahimi. She met actor Jake Gyllenhaal while filming and the pair soon became an item. Their relationship lasted for over a year, even getting engaged before they parted ways.Witherspoon's film production house went on to create 2008's ‘Penelope’, ‘Four Christmases’ (2008), ‘Legally Blondes’ and a voice role in ‘Monsters vs. Aliens’ following in 2009.
In 2010, Witherspoon teamed up with Paul Rudd, Owen Wilson and Jack Nicholson for James L. Brooks' romantic comedy film ‘How Do You Know’. Her success means that she is always on demand, with 'Water for Elephants' released in 2011 and 'This Means War', released in 2012, which starred Tom Hardy and Chris Pine as two CIA agents fall in love with the same woman, played by Witherspoon.
However, whilst Witherspoon's impressive CV of acting parts had paid off with much publicised success, her family life had suffered. In November 2006, Witherspoon filed for divorce from her husband of eight years and father of her two children, Ryan Phillippe, citing irreconcilable differences.
She has since moved on and began dating Jim Toth, a co-head at the Creative Artists Agency, in early 2010. On 26 March 2011, the actress tied the knot for the second time at her ranch in California.
Witherspoon married Jim Toth in a pink gown designed by Monique Lhuiller, with her daughter and son from her first marriage being bridesmaid and ring bearer respectively.
She told Elle Magazine that her first marriage helped her learn a lot, despite being so young at the time.
"It was a good opportunity for me to really find out what it means to be a partner and to be in a marriage and it's not anything that I thought it was. You can't say, 'I don't want to talk about that' [to your partner]. You just can't. You've got to talk about it all."
Witherspoon is further strengthened by the knowledge that with an Oscar on her mantelpiece and a reported $29 million price tag per film (surpassing Julia Roberts as the highest paid actress of all time), her future as an A-list actress is secure.
Right, so: now that we’ve convinced you Lifetime is a thing you need to have in your life – what now? How do you get this on your telly? Here’s what you have to do.

Reese WitherspoonAKA Laura Jeanne Reese WitherspoonBorn: 22-Mar-1976Birthplace: New Orleans, LA [1]Gender: FemaleRace or Ethnicity: WhiteSexual orientation: StraightOccupation: ActorNationality: United StatesExecutive summary: Legally BlondeReese Witherspoon was born in New Orleans, and raised in an expensive part of Nashville. Her father was a surgeon, her mother a college professor, and Witherspoon attended a private, all-girls school, where she was a straight-A student. She became a model at the age of 7, when a family friend who owned a flower shop asked if young Reese could pose for an advertisement. She eventually appeared in several TV commercials, took acting lessons, and at 14 she auditioned for a small role in a movie to be filmed in the Nashville area, The Man in the Moon. Instead she landed the nominal lead, as the young tomboy who gets her first kiss from Jason London. 
In supporting roles, she and William McNamara rescued an autistic and imprisoned Patricia Arquette in Wildflower, she played a hippie girl in Jack The Bear with Danny DeVito, and performed her first topless scene in the otherwise forgettable Twilight with Gene Hackman. She was the nymphomaniac sister of Tobey Maguire in Pleasantville, the innocent lass of Cruel Intentions with Sarah Michelle Gellar, Christian Bale's spoiled fiancée in American Psycho, and a prim and proper lady in The Importance of Being Earnest with Colin Firth.
She had leading roles in two more low-budget films that earned raves, playing a thoroughly modern Little Red Riding Hood in Freeway and a girl very determined to be class president in Election with Matthew Broderick. She came to major stardom as a law student wearing pink in Legally Blonde, then played the citified country girl in Sweet Home Alabama. She won the Oscar as Best Actress for her portrait of June Carter Cash, opposite Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash in Walk the Line.
In 2002, her brother, John Witherspoon Jr, was arrested after breaking into a neighbor's house and attempting to sexually molest a woman while she slept. He said he was drunk, and was sentenced to two years probation.[1] Southern Baptist Hospital (now Memorial Medical Center).

Although she made her movie debut at 15, this Southern belle steered clear of typical teen roles and instead turned in complex performances in indie favorites such as Freeway and Election. But Witherspoon's success wasn't limited to just critical acclaim. A role in Cruel Intentions (1999) alongside future husband Ryan Phillippe (whom she later divorced) made this serious actress something of a teen idol, while her charismatic turn as a Barbie doll with a brain in the 2001 comedy Legally Blonde made her a megastar. Post-Blonde, Witherspoon has tried her hand at producing and continues to land high-profile roles, including an Oscar-winning performance as Johnny Cash's wife in Walk the Line (2005).Reese Witherspoon Fast Facts:
Landed first movie role (and first on-screen kiss) in 1991's The Man in the Moon after auditioning in a 10-state talent search. Garnered critical acclaim in the film as a 14-year-old tomboy. 
When Witherspoon and her then-husband, Ryan Phillippe, were co-presenters at the 2002 Academy Awards, he gestured to the envelope and joked, "You open it. You make more money than I do."

Reese Witherspoon Biography | Photo | Legally Blonde | Ryan Phillippe | Just Like Heaven | Bio | Pregnant
Reese Witherspoon was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana but moved to Nashville, TN early on. Her father, John, is a surgeon and her mother, Betty, is a pediatric nurse. Reese has said that if she wasn't an actress she would've become a physician too. While growing up, she went to a private girls school and only considered acting a hobby. Things changed in Reese Witherspoon's junior and senior years of high school when she landed the lead role in a feature film The Man in the Moon. Reese Witherspoon suddenly found herself faxing in her homework assignments.
Reese Witherspoon's teen thriller Fear, in 1996, really started to get her noticed by the public. The flick, which also starred Mark Wahlberg, had movie peeps offering Reese roles in Scream, Urban Legends and I Know What You Did Last Summer - but she turned them all down. She didn't want to be labeled a "scream queen" and Reese says horror films, "aren't her cup of tea."
Reese Witherspoon threw herself a big bash for her 21st birthday, which included about 300 guests. One of the guests was fellow actor, Ryan Phillippe. Unfortunately, as fate would have it, Ryan was jetting off to North Carolina the very next day to film I Know What You Did Last Summer (the movie she had just turned down). The pair wrote each other letters the entire time he was away. Ryan and Reese were engaged in 1998 and married in 1999. They also filmed the blockbuster hit  Cruel Intentions together. 
Reese Witherspoon has played a lot of successful comedy roles, but none of them compare to her character, Elle Woods, from the Legally Blonde movies. With her passion for pink, her pint-sized dog Bruiser and her hottie boyfriend, played by Luke Wilson, Elle Woods is a smart, sassy role model for tons of girls.
Reese Witherspoon is defintely a modern woman, juggling a busy film career, marriage and raising two kids! Reese took a bit of a break after her Legally Blonde sequel but is now back on the big screen with a couple flicks in 2005. On September 16, 2005 you'll be able to check her out in the romantic comedy, Just Like Heaven and then in November 2005, Reese will star in the Johnny Cash biopic, Walk the Line, alongside Joaquin Phoenix. 
Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Philippe have a daughter, Ava Elizabeth, who turned seven in September 2005 and a son, Deacon, who will be two in October 2005. 
"I just don't see myself as the girl that everybody likes. I never have been, and I don't know how to be that person." 
I literally cannot wait to see this movie!! It comes out tomorrow, but I already have my tickets of course. I've read the book 7 times already, and I cry every single time. The story and characters are perfect. Hazel Grace & Augustus Waters are life okay. John Greene will remain the best author, in my opinion. Just so psyched to see this movie :D!!!!
