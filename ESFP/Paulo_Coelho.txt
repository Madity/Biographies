Paulo Coelho (Portuguese: [ˈpawlu kuˈeʎu]; born August 24, 1947), is a Brazilian lyricist and novelist. He has become one of the most widely read authors in the world today.[citation needed] He is the recipient of numerous international awards, amongst them the Crystal Award by the World Economic Forum. The Alchemist, his most famous novel, has been translated into 80 languages.[1] The author has sold 150 million copies worldwide.
Paulo Coelho was born in Brazil[2] and attended a Jesuit school. As a teenager, Coelho wanted to become a writer. Upon telling his mother this, she responded with "My dear, your father is an engineer. He's a logical, reasonable man with a very clear vision of the world. Do you actually know what it means to be a writer?"[2] After researching, which was common for him since he was a policy debater when he was in high school, Coelho concluded that a writer "always wears glasses and never combs his hair" and has a "duty and an obligation never to be understood by his own generation," amongst other things.[2] At 16, Coelho's introversion and opposition to following a traditional path led to his parents committing him to a mental institution from which he escaped three times before being released at the age of 20.[3][4][dead link] Coelho later remarked that "It wasn't that they wanted to hurt me, but they didn't know what to do... They did not do that to destroy me, they did that to save me."[5] At his parents' wishes, Coelho enrolled in law school and abandoned his dream of becoming a writer. One year later, he dropped out and lived life as a hippie, traveling through South America, North Africa, Mexico, and Europe and started drugs in the 1960s.[6][7] Upon his return to Brazil, Coelho worked as a songwriter, composing lyrics for Elis Regina, Rita Lee, and Brazilian icon Raul Seixas. Composing with Raul led to Paulo being associated with magic and occultism, due to the content of some songs.[8] In 1974, Coelho was arrested for "subversive" activities by the ruling military government, who had taken power ten years earlier and viewed his lyrics as left-wing and dangerous.[5] Coelho also worked as an actor, journalist, and theatre director before pursuing his writing career.[8]
In 1986, Coelho walked the 500-plus mile Road of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain, a turning point in his life.[6][9] On the path, Coelho had a spiritual awakening, which he described autobiographically in The Pilgrimage.[10] In an interview, Coelho stated "[In 1986], I was very happy in the things I was doing. I was doing something that gave me food and water – to use the metaphor in "The Alchemist", I was working, I had a person whom I loved, I had money, but I was not fulfilling my dream. My dream was, and still is, to be a writer."[11] Coelho would leave his lucrative career as a songwriter and pursue writing full-time.
In 1982 Coelho published his first book, Hell Archives, which failed to make a substantial impact.[8] In 1986 he contributed to the Practical Manual of Vampirism, although he later tried to take it off the shelves since he considered it “of bad quality."[8] After making the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in 1986, Coelho wrote The Pilgrimage. The following year, Coelho wrote The Alchemist and published it through a small Brazilian publishing house who made an initial print run of 900 copies and decided not to reprint.[12] He subsequently found a bigger publishing house, and with the publication of his next book Brida, The Alchemist became a Brazilian bestseller.[12][clarification needed] The Alchemist has gone on to sell more than 65 million copies, becoming one of the best-selling books in history, and has been translated into 80 different languages, winning the Guinness World Record for most translated book by a living author.[8][13]
The Alchemist, easily known as his most successful story, is a story about a young shepherd who follows his spiritual journey to the Egyptian pyramids in search of a treasure.
Since the publication of The Alchemist, Coelho has generally written one novel every two years including By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept, The Fifth Mountain, Veronika Decides to Die, The Devil and Miss Prym, Eleven Minutes, Like the Flowing River, The Valkyries and The Witch of Portobello. While trying to overcome his procrastination of launching his writing career, Coelho said, "If I see a white feather today, that is a sign that God is giving me that I have to write a new book." Coelho found a white feather in the window of a shop, and began writing that day.[10]
In total, Coelho has published 30 books. Three of them – The Pilgrimage,The Valkyries and Aleph – are autobiographical, while the majority of the rest are fictional, although rooted in his life experiences.[6] Others, like Maktub and The Manual of the Warrior of Light, are collections of essays, newspaper columns, or selected teachings. In total, Coelho has sold more than 150 million books in over 150 countries worldwide (224 territories), and his works have been translated into 80 languages.[7][8] He is the all-time bestselling Portuguese language author.[citation needed]

=======================================================
Paulo Coelho was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on August 24, 1947. Before becoming the most widely published Brazilian author of all time–publishing close to 100 million books–he worked as a theatre director, an actor and a journalist. In the 1970's, Coelho was also a successful songwriter whose songs were sung by such well-known brazilian singers as Elis Regina, Rita Lee and, most notably, Brazilian psychadelic rock pioneer Raul Seixas. Seixas and Coelho recieved wide commercial and critical acclaim for their songs "Eu Nasci Há Dez Mil Anos Atrás," "Gita," "Al Capone" as well as 60 other songs. Also during this time, Coelho travelled the world as part of the hippy movement and became more and more interested in Eastern religions as well as occultism in general. 
Coelho's definitive spiritual turn, however, came when he made a pilgrimage along the Camino de Santiago de Compostela, a catholic pilgrimage route in the north-western Spanish state of Galicia. This journey is documented in his book, The Pilgrimage (O Diário de um Mago), released in 1988. His next book was The Alchemist (O Alquimista), a book which he claims is a metaphorical adaptation of his own spiritual journey that he undertook on  his pilgrimage. Clearly, the name of the protagonist in The Alchemist is a nod to Coelho's experience on the Camino de Santiago. While sales of The Alchemist were slow at first, it went on to become the highest-selling Brazilian book of all time and one of the most widely read books in the world. Since publishing The Alchemist, Coelho has gone on to publish other titles including Brida (1990), The Valkyries (As Valkírias, 1992), By the river Piedra I sat Down and Wept (Na margem do rio Piedra eu sentei e chorei, 1994), The Fifth Mountain (O Monte Cinco, 1996), Manual of a Warrior of Light (O Manual do Guerreiro da Luz, 1997), Veronika decides to die (Veronika decide morrer, 1998), The Devil and Miss Prym, (O demônio e a Srta. Prym, 2000), Eleven Minutes (Onze Minutos, 2003), The Zahir (O Zahir, 2005), The Witch of Portobello (A Bruxa de Portobello, 2006) and, most recently, The Winner Stands Alone (O Vencedor Está Só, 2008). In addition to his books, Coelho also has a weekly column which is published in several Brazilian newspapers and is syndicated internationally. Coelho is not only an internationally acclaimed author, but is also an outspoken activist for peace and social justice. He is a Messenger of Peace for the UN, an Ambassador to the European Union for Intercultural Dialogue, a Member of the Board of the Shimon Peres Institute for Peace, a UNESCO Special Counselor for “Intercultural Dialogues and Spiritual Convergences," and a Board Member of the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship. He is also a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, the highest honor for a Brazilian author, and is one of the best-known authors to actively support the free distribution of his work.Paulo Coelho and his wife Christina split their time between Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Saint Martin, Hautes-Pyrénées, France.
=======================================================
Paulo Coelho is unquestionably of the most successful authors of recent times, selling more than 100 million books in at least 150 countries internationally. Paulo Coelho has met with a lot of success; his books have been widely translated in a number of languages, earning him the prestigious Guinness World Record for most translated book by a living author and has received much honor. However, it should be noted that Coelho was not always necessarily celebrated for being the writer that he is today.
Paulo Coelho was born on August 24, 1947 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. As An adolescent, Coelho expressed a longing to become a writer. However, his mother was of the opinion that Coelho should do pursue something along the lines of his father, who was an engineer. This longing and unwavering determination ultimately led to his parents enrolling him in a mental institution. Coelho managed flee thrice and finally was released when he was 20. Paulo maintains that his parents acted out of goodwill.
Coelho got admitted in law school for his parent’s sake in 1970, leaving his yearning to write. Eventually, he left and took up traveling to South America, North Africa, Mexico, and Europe. He engaged in drugs and lived as a hippie. He went on to work in all sorts of professions before returning to his original dream – writing. In his book the Pilgrimage, Paulo Coelho details a spiritual awakening when he walked more than 500 miles Road of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain an event which changed his life.
“Hell Archives” was Coelho’s initial book which was published in 1982 and was not well received. The Pilgrimage was released in 1987 which is a reminiscence of the spiritual awakening he went through. Later, The Alchemist was made available which turned out to be becoming one of the best-selling books in history, selling over 65 million copies.
Coelho has published many other works which have also received critical acclaim, for instance; The Fifth Mountain, The Valkyries, Veronika Decides to Die, The Devil and Miss Prym, By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept, Eleven Minutes, The Witch of Portobello and Like the Flowing River.
He has been married Christina Oiticica since 1980. Paulo is habitual contributor to society. He is a Messenger of Peace for the UN and Coelho established the”Paulo Coelho Institute” which offers aid to those who face financial issues.

A year later, he wrote 'The Pilgrimage', an autobiographical novel that is considered the beginning of his career.In the following year, COELHO published 'The Alchemist'. Slow initial sales convinced his first publisher to drop the novel, but it went on to become one of the best selling Brazilian books of all time.Other titles include 'Brida' (1990), 'The Valkyries' (1992), 'By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept' (1994), the collection of his best columns published in the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.

          Start reading Paulo Coelho: A Warrior's Life: The Authorized Biography on your Kindle in under a minute.
       International bestseller Paulo Coelho has captured the imaginations of millions of readers with his mystical, semi-autobiographical fiction. Despite his success (and a brilliant facility for self-promotion), few readers know anything about Coelho the man. This authorized biography plunges into the details of Coelho's life, from his perilous birth to his time in asylums to his multifarious spiritual journey to his staggering 25-year writing career. Brazilian journalist, politician and biographer Morais writes with an unapologetic eye, neither judging Coelho nor seeking to justify his actions, smartly presenting the facts for readers' appraisal. Coelho himself provides a generous level of access and candor, giving readers the feeling that they are getting a privileged view despite the biography's "authorized" label; what makes Morais' biography especially revealing is his access to years of Coelho's diaries, a goldmine for biographer and reader. Fans of Coelho's work will eagerly tear through this attentive, satisfying biography. Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
       It’s always a bit disconcerting when a biography of a well-known figure appears during his lifetime. It seems to leave so much hanging in the balance—so many blank pages waiting expectantly to be filled. Internationally acclaimed author Paulo Coelho (The Alchemist, 1993) is only 63 years old, yet the incredible story of his life and his incandescent work could already fill several volumes. Committed to a mental institution at the age of 17 by parents who could not grasp the enormity of his talent or understand his unconventional approach to life, he spent decades rushing headlong down many less-traveled roads, zealously steeping himself in a variety of often bizarre lifestyles before experiencing a life-altering reconversion to the Christian faith in his middle years. After reading this biography, it is easy to understand how and why these youthful experiences and his subsequent spiritual reawakening inform his fiction with the mystical depth that is his literary trademark. Readers will definitely want to see how his unfolding story continues to play out. --Margaret Flanagan
  I could write an entire blog on A Warrior's Life. I'm a huge Paulo Coelho fan, so I was really looking forward to reading this book. In retrospect I realise I had wanted to read about someone who could have been drawn from one of his novels - a noble, wise character who has a troubled life and then receives enlightenment and goes off to make the world a better place. The real Coelho, is, well, real. He's a hedonistic, obsessive drug taker, sometime satanist, wracked by depression and driven by an obsessive desire to become an internationally renowned writer. Wealth, women and fame are chewed through on his path to achieve that one goal. In the tales of his early life, it is hard to find much to like beyond his incredible commitment to his writing. When he reaches the turning point in his writing career - through a mystical encounter at the Dachau concentration camp - I was desperately hoping that this would be his road to Damascus moment, and Coelho would transform into the man of vision that his writing suggests he should be. I was left, however, with the niggling suspicion, that he had merely hit upon the way to achieve the commercial success he'd always dreamed of. Does it change the way I will read his novels? Possibly. I'm still processing this one. It's a well written book, but in many ways I wish I hadn't read it.
Paulo Coelho is one of those writers whose books stay with you long after you've finished reading. "Veronica decides to die" is one of the most absorbing books i've read, and my all time favourite quotes is from The Alchemist- "Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure. You've got to find the treasure, so that everything you have learned along the way can make sense." His books talk about love, life, sex, human suffering, man's search for God, spirituality.... they talk of everything that I'm most curious about, and if his sales records are to go by, as are Millions of people. Yet, the most fascinating book about Paulo's thoughts is ironically not written by him at all. "A Warrior's Life" is SUCH a remarkable book about the author that completely grips you from start to finish. His birth, his childhood, his dabbling in black magic, his initiation into white magic... I promise you, his story is more fascinating and fast paced than any of his books! And nothing is held back too... his personal diaries which he wanted to burn after his demise have all been opened up for the biographers use. And tales of him practically torturing a poor soul and treating him like a slave (and calling him one too!) and experiences of him and his current partner "experimenting" while whipping each other, etc etc... Nothing has been missed out.What I found especially interesting was the background stories to each of his books. How he came up with the story, how he was guided to write each one, what personal demons was he trying to face or what amazing experience was he wanting teach, when writing every single book of his. Once you end this book, if you are a Coelho fan, you will surely want to go back to the beginning and re-read every single book published by him.Read more ›
  I had already read several of Paulo Coelho's books and have always devoured his books.  It was nice to read the authorized biography as it allowed me to understand why he wrote some of the books I read and to put a very real feel to an incredible author.  It is also very nice to see a person overcome many obstacles and still live his dream and be very successful.  Many people would have given up long before Paulo had.
8 of 10 people found the following review helpfulAny library where Paul Coelho's writings are popular must have this
  Paul Coelho: A Warrior's Life provides an authorized biography of the author of THE ALCHEMIST and covers his entire life, from his birth in Brazil and survival against all odds to his struggles with mental illness, prison time, and more. He rediscovered his faith in 1986 as he walked a medieval pilgrim's route between France and Spain, and this life-changing experience would result in writings that achieved world-wide recognition. Any library where Paul Coelho's writings are popular must have this.
  If you're a fan of Coelho's works, skip this autobiography.  The author seems to hold his subject in great contempt, repeatedly calling him ugly (which is disproven by the included photos) and listing in boring detail things like every single poor grade received in school, while mentioning significant life events only in passing.  So poorly written, I had to speed-read over many tedious passages and read between the lines of the poorly-explained life transitions to get to the meat of what actually occurred in Mr. Coelho's formative years to lead him to become the person he is today.  I can't imagine why this book is the authorized version.
  I love this book! It has so much in it, Paulo reveals everything, it's a chance to meet the author, to know the author. Some say it's a shocking book, but I will say for me it brought me closer to one of my favorite authors. His battles, his determination to become who he is, his ups and downs, he really fought hard to become who he is. And why 5 stars is the limit anyway, I would give it more! Thank you Paulo!
      Journalist Morais indulges the reader in pointillistic detail in this biography of Coelho. Often regarded as a modern day prophet, Coelho's life bears resemblance to the typical...
      After reading this book, I cannot for the life of me understand how anyone looks to this man as a spiritual anything.
      Once I started reading this book,  couldn't put it down. All of his books leave you thinking for days and have such an impact.
      Nothing wrong with the contents BUT i think the book has been kept in store/warehouse for far too long.
      I had never heard of Paulo Coelho before winning this book. I thought it was very interesting and well written.
      I don't understand why Paulo decided to open his life like this. Having said that, BRAVO PAULO!

Paulo Coelho: A Warrior’s Life is the definitive, authorized biography of one of the world’s most popular and widely read authors—and the story of how his enormously popular novel The Alchemist came to be. Fernando Morais, the preeminent biographer in Brazil and a groundbreaking journalist, traces Coelho’s roots in Brazil to his time as a musician and pop lyricist to his wild days of rock and roll to the publication of the The Alchemist and beyond, telling the true tale of one of the most adored authors of our time.Book DescriptionPaulo Coelho: A Warrior's Life is the first-ever biography of the man whose books have sold an astounding 100 million copies worldwide, making him one of the bestselling authors of all time.Paulo Coelho's life begins with a complicated birth in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August 1947. He was known as the "boy who was born dead" and who ultimately survived against all odds. Before he became internationally known as a worldwide bestselling author, Paulo lived many different lives. He flirted with suicide, was committed by his parents to insane asylums, suffered the brutality of electric shock therapy, dove into drugs, tried several varieties of sex, met the devil, spent time in prison, helped revolutionize Brazilian rock with musician Raul Seixas, and finally rediscovered his faith in 1986 as he walked the sacred Road to Santiago de Compostela, a medieval pilgrim's route between France and Spain.Coelho would later describe this life-changing spiritual experience in his first book, The Pilgrimage. The following year, The Alchemist established his worldwide reputation. The novel has already achieved the status of a universally admired modern classic. Now, for the first time, discover the life story of one of the most widely read and adored authors of our time.(less)

Here comes my all time favorite Author, my real life mentor. Paulo is the man behind my life's uplift and enrichment, his ideas have largely and greatly nourished and conditioned my thought process. I have possibly read all his books, started with 'The Alchemist' which propelled me to take my life's biggest and most important decision with vigor and discretion. I embraced the basic principle of life that 'where is your treasure, there is your heart'. Yeah, this Man was behind and most instrumental in my search to seek the truth and follow my heart. After the dark was over, I soon started living a life with zeal, zest and passion. I did what my soul really wanted to do. I started following my dreams and living my desires.After 'The Alchemist', followed 'The Brida'. 'The Brida' is the fable of a girl. We often tend to feel a strange connection with this book. At some point of time, we all are perplexed as what to chose among the two options? Whom to settle for - Our heart or our Mind. Though, the choice has always been difficult, it is circumspect and wise to listen to your mind. Wise up and be practical. From 'Veronika decides to die' I learned and practiced that Life is just not about making choices, life is all about control. Often, we are tempted to do some deeds which could be unethical and sinful, then life is all about making the right choice !! Yeah, I did.From each of his fables, I have always picked some lesson. I learned how to pluck courage in life to assert on the points and principles you believe in.With so many lessons and good sayings swaying my mind, I have had a very high opinion about this Man, a demigod to me. But, I was appalled and shocked to read that Paulo was a mind sick, demented and brainless nut in his youth. He was an impostor and fraudster. A big time liar and a jerk. And the worst, a junkie who used to smoke cannabis and cocaine. We tend to have the image of our mentors as somebody who is just the picture of idealism and perfection. But, as they say the night is the darkest just before the dawn. Paulo went through a series of ruts and potholes but eventually climbed out of them and emerged out as a winner. After all, A winner stands alone and is distinct !!!(less)

How true that we make demigods of those we admire. Hence, because of conditioning as to what’s right and what’s wrong,  many are shocked when they read or hear of a dark past, and judge and denigrate the one they’d admired. How refreshing to read your comment―obviously very surprised at what was divulged―and able to sum it up so wisely: “But, as they say the night is the darkest just before the dawn. Paulo went through a series of ruts and potholes but eventually climbed out of them and emerged out as a winner”. We’ve all got stuff, albeit to a lesser degree: it’s the ‘climbing out’ that holds the key.(less)
There was a lot I didn't know about Coelho. I felt the ending of the biography was a bit weak, boring. But he seems to have lived an interesting life thus far. I was surprised about the whole dabbling into 'satanism'. I never would have guessed that about him, nor about his often callous attitude toward women in his life. Judging from the book, he seemed  hell bent on being famous and for me, it seems contrary to claim you're on a path of spirituality (be it religious or not) and on that same bre...more

Judging from the book, he seemed  hell bent on being famous and for me, it seems contrary to claim you're on a path of spirituality (be it religious or not) and on that same breath be honing in on fame. It's my personal opinion that fame shouldn't be your goal if you're looking for spiritual enlightenment. If fame happens as a by product of your journey then great. I know he markets himself well, and what writer wouldn't? I am judging by the statements early on in his life about how he wanted to be well known. I guess I just didn't expect that from reading his literature, that he would be consumed with fame.The whole drug thing surprised me too. Then again, looking at the time period, it certainly didn't 'shock' me. I cannot imagine living in a country where you can't truly be free (in the sense of what your political and religious opinons are) and I admire anyone with the strength of conviction to 'act out' be it in writing, speaking, etc. Worth the read.(less)

Paulo Coelho was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.[1] He attended a Jesuit school. As a teenager, Coelho wanted to become a writer. Upon telling his mother this, she responded with "My dear, your father is an Engineer. He's a logical, reasonable man with a very clear vision of the world. Do you actually know what it means to be a writer?"[1] After researching, Coelho concluded that a writer "always wears glasses and never combs his hair" and has a "duty and an obligation never to be understood by his own generation," amongst other things.[1] At 17, Coelho's introversion and opposition to following a traditional path led to his parents committing him to a mental institution from which he escaped three times before being released at the age of 20.[2][3] Coelho later remarked that "It wasn't that they wanted to hurt me, but they didn't know what to do... They did not do that to destroy me, they did that to save me."[4]At his parents' wishes, Coelho enrolled in law school and abandoned his dream of becoming a writer. One year later, he dropped out and lived life as a hippie, traveling through South America, North Africa, Mexico, and Europe and becoming immersed in the drug culture of the 1960s.[5][6] Upon his return to Brazil, Coelho worked as a songwriter, composing lyrics for Elis Regina, Rita Lee, and Brazilian icon Raul Seixas. Composing with Raul led to Paulo being associated with satanism and occultism, due to the content of some songs.[7] In 1974, Coelho was arrested and tortured for "subversive" activities by the ruling military government, who had taken power ten years earlier and viewed his lyrics as left-wing and dangerous.[4] Coelho also worked as an actor, journalist, and theatre director before pursuing his writing career.[7]In 1986, Coelho walked the 500-plus mile Road of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain, a turning point in his life.[5][8] On the path, Coelho had a spiritual awakening, which he described autobiographically in The Pilgrimage.[9] In an interview, Coelho stated "[In 1986], I was very happy in the things I was doing. I was doing something that gave me food and water -- to use the metaphor in "The Alchemist", I was working, I had a person who I loved, I had money, but I was not fulfilling my dream. My dream was, and still is, to be a writer."[10] Coelho would leave his lucrative career as a songwriter and pursue writing full-time.(less)
An illuminating book about an author who I only discovered recently, ironically at about the same age as he was when he wrote his first major book, The Pilgrimage. But Coelho has lived a much more extreme life than I, including a period where he was heavily involved in Satanism. I was actually pretty shocked about that.

An illuminating book about an author who I only discovered recently, ironically at about the same age as he was when he wrote his first major book, The Pilgrimage. But Coelho has lived a much more extreme life than I, including a period where he was heavily involved in Satanism. I was actually pretty shocked about that. Indeed, Coelho comes across in this biography as a sometimes dishonest and manipulative man. The biographer had access to his diaries and has exposed a lot of information about Coelho that the famous writer probably wasn't expecting to ever be made public. The biography also sometimes pandered to its subject and so I can't help wondering what it left out.All that said, I admire Coelho tremendously for living a full, fun life and for communicating the spiritualism he discovered to millions of fans - including me. He's lived a very fortunate life, having enjoyed money and hedonism (sex and drugs) in his youth. He's also had a difficult life at times, notably the 3 times he was put into mental asylums in his teenage years. Whichever way you look at it, it's been an extraordinary life.Coelho still has many eccentricities, but undeniably he's found happiness in his spirituality and who he is now. I respect that a lot.

From the first pages the story makes you feel quite ambiguous about the famous writer. The biography it's very detailed. Obviously, Mr. Morais had a huge stuff to work on it. But as in the end of the book the letter of P. Coelho says it -pretty much- he didn't gave the more secret or sentimental aspects of Coelho's life and character. For example, he refers the writer's feelings so little times and when he does to he doesn't pay too much attention. It sounds to me like he is describing the life...more

For example, he refers the writer's feelings so little times and when he does to he doesn't pay too much attention. It sounds to me like he is describing the life and the actions of a robot and not a passionate human being with such a full life! Also, in the end there were too many details about the sales of his book...So many numbers of the sales and the money he earned! I was a little tired of that... Anyway as my general opinion about getting know better with Coelho...As i already said i feeli really ambiguous! I've read his books and i really like them, but now i've seen a writer who almost did everything to be famous and rich i feel very confused... His books are supposed to make people follow their dreams and live life to the fullest and pay attention to things that really matter or be more spiritual. But how can he persuade us for all this when himself had so low motives and he is a member of an esoteric organisation? I don't know if Mr. Morais paid more attention to the negative side of Coelho or Coelho is really such a person, but it's worth to read it and have your own opinion about it.(less)
Paulo Coelho is a teacher. Through reading his books "The Alchemist" to "By the River Piedra I sat" to "Eleven Minutes" and finally "The Zahir" I have always left with big lessons.

Paulo Coelho has sold 100 million books in the metaphysical spiritual genre, written in the style of light novels or fables. His most famous one is The Alchemist, which I loved. Since I've read most of his books, I wanted to see how much of his personal life was contained in them. I found out that many of the magical/sorcery experiences he's had actually are things he's experienced in real life.

I found out that many of the magical/sorcery experiences he's had actually are things he's experienced in real life. In addition, his experiences with being forcibly hospitalized as a young adult, for what his parents called mental illness and I would call just not fitting in, figure into his books. Coelho is a passionate, deep, unconventional man with a profound sense of the mystery of life. Those who feel practices like tarot, rituals, and searching for hidden meanings are silly, however, might not like his books. I was surprised to find that his books are extremely popular in Russia. The biography, which was authorized, was fascinating, but the writer gave to many details, so it moved too slowly.  (less)
I was looking forward to reading this book as I had enjoyed THE ALCHEMIST but finally abandoned it on page 310.  It was well written and interesting in many respects but I just simply tired of all the repetitive ways Mr. Coelho managed to degrade himself.  He apparently only succeeded in his ambition to write by sheer luck. He was so involved in self destruction and dabbling in every kind of defeating life style it was amazing he survived.

Well - this one is a bit hard for me to judge for several reasons. I've skim-read the book in a quite fast pace. I can tell that formally it's not much to write home about - its factual and frank. The content - as obvious with biographies - depends on the biographee and your relation to her/him.I have read only two books by Coelho (Alchymist and Veronica decided to die) and disliked both of them (both would merit barely 1 goodread star) and the biography just convinced me that I'm certainly not...more

The content - as obvious with biographies - depends on the biographee and your relation to her/him.I have read only two books by Coelho (Alchymist and Veronica decided to die) and disliked both of them (both would merit barely 1 goodread star) and the biography just convinced me that I'm certainly not going to read anything by him in the future (while I wasn't intending anyway - he got his second chance, already).It was a surprise for me to learn about his life - that he went through these occult phases etc. and that apparently he actually believes the mystical-new-age-selfhelp type of hogwash he infuses his books. I find it very interesting that his main aim was to become a *famous* writer, rather then a direct desire and love for writing. I'm sure he likes to write, but it's made clear that this is only induced through his primary desire to be recognized. Coelho is however good in one thing (and works very hard for it) - in being famous, promoting himself and so on. This is the thing he always wanted and eventually got it.I'm not sure it makes sense to buy this book. Coelho fans will anyway and the rest can get the same information for free from Wikipedia. This is not so much Morais' fault. I'm very pleased that the whole book is very frank and does not paint Coelho rosily. On the other hand, the biography is authorized and this is another display of Coelho's smugness - he is so enlightened that he allows the ugly truth to be said. And I mean smugness also in a very matter-of-fact way, rather than judginly.Yes, I would be happier if some who a) actually could write, b) actually loved writing for its own sake and c) was rational would sell so many books instead. But Coelho is an interesting figure in any case... but in this slightly saddening way. Oh, well.(less)
I have for now stopped reading this book. I received the book for free through Goodreads First Reads hoping that I would be able to write a good review, but unfortunately I can hardly finish the book. I had never heard of Paulo Coelho or Fernando Morais. The first few chapters are just another way for Paulo to share his narcissism with the world. He loves being catered to and brags endlessly about his accomplishments. The rest of it is just the most boring account of anyone's life I have ever he...more
I have for now stopped reading this book. I received the book for free through Goodreads First Reads hoping that I would be able to write a good review, but unfortunately I can hardly finish the book. I had never heard of Paulo Coelho or Fernando Morais. The first few chapters are just another way for Paulo to share his narcissism with the world. He loves being catered to and brags endlessly about his accomplishments. The rest of it is just the most boring account of anyone's life I have ever heard. It really could have been been shortened to a few paragraphs... "He didn't do so well in school or socially, his parents put him in a mental institution when he was young, he became a writer, now you're hearing about it."Not everyone's life is interesting. Maybe if I had any interest in his books or his life I may have liked it better. Throughout the whole book he talks about how famous he is worldwide and how much everyone loves him and his books, but I have yet to hear about him other than picking up this book.(less)
 Okay, so I never read any of Paulo Coelho's books but I do own them and I was going to get to them eventually! After reading this book I will push them up on my list. Fernando has a way with words. He truly is a great writer. His other books are not in English but from reading this one book I can tell he is quite good. I loved the beginning of how it is the present and it explains how famous he is. It is pretty awesome to see a writer be as famous as say a regular celebrity or even a president!...more

He is super intelligent and his life was crazy! But I loved how it had built from it and how he never gave up. He truly id...Obsesses (?) with writing. You can tell from beginning to end the Paulo Coelho truly was born to write and it is amazing the things he went through and to where he is today is just astounding. His father is crazy but then again we do live in different cultures. Either way, his family is not normal and neither is Coelho and I think that's what makes him great. I hear so many wonderful things about his writing and I read some samples in the book so I have no doubts that I will not love his writings. I gave it a 4 starer (would have given a 3.75 if I could)Stay tuned for when I do read the 2 books I own: The Zahir and The Alchemist.(less)

Πρώτα απ΄ όλα θα αρχίσω ομολογώντας ότι δεν έχω διαβάσει κανένα βιβλίο του Κοέλιο, ακόμα. Yποθέτω, όμως, ότι θα πρέπει να διαβάσω μερικά βιβλία του, κρίνοντας από την τόσο μεγάλη απήχηση που έχει στο αναγνωστικό κοινό (μέχρι παραληρήματος...)Και μ' αυτά, αρχίζουν οι πανηγυρικές μου σκέψεις.Διαβάζοντας τη βιογραφία ενός θρυλικού και ζώντος συγγραφέα νιώθω τη μέγιστη απογοήτευση. Το βιβλίο ξεκινά (και τελειώνει, επίσης) με το glamour της τωρινής του ζωής και το μάτι του στις πωλήσεις, τα κέρδη και πώς θα χτυπήσει τις παράνομες εκτυπώσεις των βιβλίων του. Έχω ήδη χαλαστεί γιατί υποτίθεται ότι θα διαβάσω τη διαδρομή ενός spiritualist.Και αρχίζει η περιγραφή (πολύ λεπτομερής, τόσο που καταντάει περιττή γιατί π.χ. ουδόλως μ' ενδιαφέρει τι μάρκα τσιγάρα καπνίζει): Αυτός ο άνθρωπος, γόνος ευυπόληπτης και πλούσιας βραζιλιάνικης οικογένειας (με μπάτλερ), δεν ήξερε τίποτα για τον εαυτό του (ποιος ξέρει…) αλλά πειραματίστηκε με όλα, ασπάστηκε τα πάντα που βρέθηκαν στο δρόμο του. Ένα μόνο ήξερε από μικρός: ότι ήθελε να γίνει διάσημος με τη συγγραφή, να αποκτήσει δύναμη, εξουσία και λεφτά.Δοκίμασε τη σεξουαλικότητά του και με τα 2 φύλα, κατέληξε με προτίμηση στις γυναίκες (αλλά με όλες τις γυναίκες), εμφανίστηκε ως κομμουνιστής γιατί ήταν της μόδας (κατά βάθος καμία υπόληψη δεν είχε στα πολιτικά συστήματα, εκτός κι αν ήταν προς το συμφέρον του), σε πολιτικές διαμαρτυρίες κατέβαινε για την προσφερόμενη διασκέδαση και εκτόνωση (αλλά καθόλου υπερβολές γιατί το σωματικό του εκτόπισμα δεν ήταν να το φοβάσαι), εδραιώθηκε ως χίπις (εκ του ασφαλούς, είχε το ακαταλόγιστο), μαστουρωμένος μονίμως (ολόκληρα 24ωρα, όσο άντεχε), βούλιαξε στο σατανισμό (ούτε του Μάνσον η παράνοια δεν τον ξεθόλωσε), αποφάσεις έπαιρνε στη ζωή του πετώντας το κέρμα (i ching, κινέζικη μαντική τέχνη) και κατέληξε να ασπαστεί την αίρεση της Αδελφότητας του Ram, της οποίας έγινε και Δάσκαλος. Ανάμεσα στις όποιες αναζητήσεις των σκοπών του είχε και διαστήματα ακόμα πιο έντονης κατάθλιψης με αποκορύφωμα την ιδέα της αυτοκτονίας (φοβόταν, όμως και να πεθάνει, γιατί κι αν είναι αλήθεια όσα λένε για την Κόλαση;). Μέχρι τα 22 του χρόνια, οι γονείς του τον είχαν κλείσει σε ψυχιατρείο 3 φορές. Με ηλεκτροσόκ προσπαθούσαν να γιατρέψουν τη ζωηράδα του (...). Προσπαθούσε, μονίμως, να αντισταθμίσει την ελλιπή εξωτερική του εμφάνιση με το διανοητικό του πλούτο (πολυδιαβασμένος, έκανε χρήση όλων όσων διάβαζε και διάβαζε τα πάντα, θαμπώνοντας τους άλλους).Δεν μπόρεσα να τον συμπαθήσω τελικά. Η ανωριμότητά του φαίνεται σε όλο τα πεδία σκέψεως και δράσεως στο βιβλίο μέχρι τη βαθιά ενήλικη ζωή του (τουλάχιστον στο βιβλίο αρχίζει μια σοβαροφάνεια από την ώρα που αρχίζουν να εκδίδονται τα βιβλία του). Παιδί ήταν όταν πήρε το τιμόνι και παραλίγο να σκοτώσει έναν 7χρονο. Παιδί ήταν όταν ζήτησε από την κοπέλα του για απόδειξη της αγάπης της να τον αφήσει να σβήσει το τσιγάρο του στο μπούτι της... Ο χαρακτήρας του; Ο τρισχείριστος: ανώριμος, ασταθής, manipulator, υλιστής, εγωιστής, συμφεροντολόγος, τσιγκούνης και δειλός. Μου θυμίζει περίπτωση ενός κακομαθημένου πλουσιόπαιδου που με το lifestyle του θέλει να πληγώσει τους γονείς του (έκανε τα δικά του αλλά πάντα είχε κάπου να γυρνάει, στη σιγουριά του πατρικού του). Η συμπεριφορά του προς τους φίλους του (αν και ο ίδιος διατείνεται ότι τίποτα δε θα ήταν χωρίς αυτούς) είναι τουλάχιστον εξοργιστική. Δεν είδα καμιά αυτοκριτική για την αρνητική του επιρροή προς το Ραούλ ή για το ότι προσέλαβε έναν άλλο φίλο του ως σκλάβο (!) και πολλά άλλα...Αυτός που θεωρεί τον εαυτό του πνευματικό και διάνοια, πώς την ευτυχία την εξισώνει με τα λεφτά και τα υπέρογκα ποσά; Γιατί στο δικό μου βιβλίο δε συμβαδίζουν. Έτσι βγαίνουν τα διανοητικά πονήματα; Μέσα από το βούρκο; Λίγη ταπεινότητα δε βλάπτει! Περίμενα διαβάζοντας αυτή τη βιογραφία να θαυμάσω κάτι! Δε θαύμασα τίποτα. Ίσως αν διαβάσει ο ίδιος τη βιογραφία του (επειδή όντως η αλήθεια μιλώντας την λυτρώνει) βρει τη δική του λύτρωση μέσα του κάνοντας την αυτοκριτική του.Ένα καλό μόνο βρήκα διαβάζοντας το βιβλίο: επεσήμανα αρκετά βιβλία αλλοεθνών συγγραφέων για διάβασμα..Κατά τα άλλα συγχαρητήρια στον image maker του, που τον δείχνει τουλάχιστον συμπαθέστατο!(less)
Biographies are difficult to review - no matter how good the biographer's writing might be, the success of the book really depends on how interesting the subject of the biography is. Fortunately for Fernando Morais and the reader, Paulo Coelho has evidently had a far more eventful life than the average person.

Biographies are difficult to review - no matter how good the biographer's writing might be, the success of the book really depends on how interesting the subject of the biography is. Fortunately for Fernando Morais and the reader, Paulo Coelho has evidently had a far more eventful life than the average person. The first half of the book, which dealt with Coelho's early life, was fascinating although I found I started to lose interest nearer the end.Many biographers (particularly the authors of unauthorised biographies) allow their own opinions and speculations to get in the way of the facts - Fernando Morais does not do this. The book was written with the full cooperation of Paulo Coelho and Morais writes in a professional, factual style. He was given full access to Coelho's diaries which date back to his teenage years, though he repeatedly points out that Coelho tended to fantasize in his diary entries and therefore we can't place too much reliance on them. However, the inclusion of the diary entries, along with other fragments of Coelho's writing, gives us a better insight into his mind.Morais looks at every stage of Coelho's life in so much depth it's obvious that he spent a lot of time researching the book thoroughly. He provides a complete list of all the people he interviewed during his research including some of Paulo's friends, family members and former girfriends. Some of Coelho's fans may be disappointed and disillusioned as he is often portrayed in a bad light, but as the biography was published with Coelho's blessing, he was obviously happy for us to read about the negative aspects of his character as well as the positive.A Warrior's Life was an interesting book to read, despite the fact that before beginning it I knew almost nothing about Paulo Coelho. I received a review copy from LibraryThing Early Reviewers and was glad to have an opportunity to read a biography I would probably never have read otherwise.http://shereadsnovels.wordpress.com(less)
Well, what can I say? I never expected that this timid Brazilian boy would have such an interesting life.

Well, what can I say? I never expected that this timid Brazilian boy would have such an interesting life. With his exploits in the occult, his unwanted visits to the asylum, the reluctant experimental lifestyle, and the bevy of women that graces the pages, I would be compelled to say that this was an amazing read, but for some reason I felt a heavy hand in turning the pages. Most of the time I had second thoughts of picking up the book, but I came to realize that every situation lead him to his personal legend, his true destiny. A person's life doesn't have to follow a certain pattern or plan, and as soon as the reader understands and accepts the journey that the writer is taking him to, the whole read becomes a liberating experience. If you are a big Coelho fan like I am, it is a definite must read, but buckle down and have an open mind, for surprises lurk with every turn of the page. If you think his stories are interesting, wait until you read about his life.(less)

This book is only for hard-core Coelho readers!  While it provides a lot of insight into his works, the style is monotonous and the author chooses some strange areas of focus.  For instance, instead of talking about Coelho's mysterious pilgrimage, or detailing his involvement in Satanism, he devotes page after page to descriptions of fleeting love affairs and real estate investments.  If Coelho wasn't such a fascinating person, a mystery wrapped in a mystery wrapped in an enigma, this book would ha...more

Journalist Morais indulges the reader in pointillistic detail in this biography of Coelho. Often regarded as a modern day prophet, Coelho's life bears resemblance to the typical hero myth, albeit set in the hippy milieu of the 1960s. He was born dead and was revived under miraculous circumstances.

Journalist Morais indulges the reader in pointillistic detail in this biography of Coelho. Often regarded as a modern day prophet, Coelho's life bears resemblance to the typical hero myth, albeit set in the hippy milieu of the 1960s. He was born dead and was revived under miraculous circumstances. He demonstrated remarkable talent in his youth, suffered modern trials in the form of psychiatric hospitalizations, encountered helpers that provided him with tools (theater, drugs, witchcraft) for his journey, and finally realized his destiny. Morais refrains from glorifying Coelho and even interprets his subject's neurotic superstitious behavior as obsessive compulsive disorder, though it is likely that many of Coelho's readers will share his magical-religious way of perceiving the world. The development of Coelho's familiar body of work isn't addressed until the final quarter, where we learn, for example, that  was originally written as a theatrical script. While his most devoted fans will have read in other sources about Coelho's forays into rather emblematic sixties pursuits: Satanism and witchcraft, polyamory, and drugs, Morais successfully fleshes out Coelho as a personality for his disciples and detractors alike. This will undoubtedly be a popular book in the libraries and bookstores where Coelho's work is appreciated(less)
As a major fan of the Alchemist, I was completely blind-sided by this book.

I had never heard of Paulo Coelho before winning this book. I thought it was very interesting and well written. You can definitely tell the Brazilian background on some of the phraseology used in the book. The only part that got a little weird for me is his black magic phase. Otherwise, he has a very interesting life and it captured my attention. I also guess that the time period this book took place is a little different to compare to the USA.
A 'warts and all' authorized biography. Lots of black magic, sex and drugs, and personal dramas, before Coelho sees the light and repents. Some of it sounds a bit incredible, but we see how these events shaped his maturity as a storyteller with his experiences in pantomimes, film appearances  and rock concerts. Surprisingly, not all of the book is set in Brazil – Coelho lived in London, Spain and the US at different times. 
a glimpse on Paulo Coelho's personal life.. Comprise of many detail information that many might not know yet. I found the opening chapter to be quite interesting as it gives a new picture how Coelho is somehow fame-addict kinna writer. But if we take a closer look at Coelho's book, the Zahir, which the main character is basically his own, i guess the account could be count accountable
The book is the biography of an awesome writer, what more can i say about the story line of the book.  Coming to the writing style of the author (Fernando Morais), he shows the life of Paulo unravel in front of our eyes. He takes us through nearly every bit of the wax and wane life of his. A must read for everyone.
Autobiography of one of my favorite authors, Paulo Coelho.  Great insights.  I was surprised that so many of his real life is reflected in his books which I hadn't realized had so much of his actual experiences in them.

Fantástico o livro de Fernando de Moraes que conta a história do internacional Paulo Coelho. A história desse brasileiro está repleta de aventuras e passagens pitorescas. Hippie por opção, Paulo Coelho escreveu diários desde quando era adolescente, desta forma registros detalhados de sua vida ficaram a disposição do autor de sua biografia. Escutar esse livro me fez pensar muito sobre a vida, Paulo foi um obstinado pelo sonho de ser um escritor mundialmente famoso. Acredito muito no poder dos sonhos, no fator de perseguir uma meta com foco e energia. Esse pensamento que perseguiu Paulo manteve ele em pé depois de cada tropeço. Nem mesmo o dinheiro tem essa influência em nossa vida. Recomendo a leitura de “O Mago”.A experiência de ouvir o livro somente no carro foi positiva. A sensação de aproveitar aquele tempo que antes era dedicado apenas a contemplação do trânsito, foi ocupado pelo conteúdo da biografia. Na voz de José Mayer esse audiolivro servia até como um inibidor do stress e relaxante para os momentes de alta tensão. Com certeza comprarei outro audilivro para continuar com a experiência.(less)
