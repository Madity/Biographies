Danielle de Niese (born 11 April 1979) is a lyric soprano. After success as a young child in singing competitions in Australia, she moved to the United States where she developed an operatic career. From 2005 she came to widespread public attention with her performances as Cleopatra in Giulio Cesare at Glyndebourne, England.
De Niese was born in Melbourne, Australia, after her parents, Chris and Beverly, had migrated from Sri Lanka to Australia as teenagers – she is a Sri Lankan Burgher of mostly Dutch heritage.[1] In 1988, at the age of nine, she became the youngest winner of the Australian TV talent competition, Young Talent Time. In the competition, she was singing a Whitney Houston medley, for which the prize was A$ 5,000 and a Yamaha baby grand piano, which she still owns.[1]
In 1990, her family moved to Los Angeles, where she became a regular guest host of the TV programme L.A. Kids for which she won an Emmy Award at the age of 16.[2]
De Niese made her professional operatic debut at the age of 15 with the Los Angeles Opera. She became the youngest singer ever to participate in the Young Artists Studio at the Metropolitan Opera,[3] where she debuted in 1998 at the age of 19 as Barbarina in a new production of Le nozze di Figaro directed by Jonathan Miller and conducted by James Levine.
Ridley Scott's 2001 film Hannibal features a scene from Dante's La Vita Nuova; in it, de Niese sings as the character Beatrice the song "Vide Cor Meum" by Patrick Cassidy. She was subsequently asked to perform the title role in the Met's production of Maurice Ravel's L'enfant et les sortilèges. Other Met roles include Cleopatra in Giulio Cesare (2007), Euridice in Orfeo ed Euridice (2009), and Susanna in the same production of Le Nozze di Figaro in which she sang Barbarina in 1998.[4]
De Niese's still growing career has ranged through Baroque music (Poppea in L'incoronazione di Poppea), via Handel, Mozart and contemporary opera premieres (RAAFF by Robin de Raaff (nl), 2004, De Nederlandse Opera)[5] at major opera houses around the world, to Broadway (Les Misérables) and film (Hannibal) roles. She has appeared in productions of a number of Baroque operas on stage and on DVD, including the Les Arts Florissants production of Les Indes galantes by Jean-Philippe Rameau, and as Cleopatra in Giulio Cesare, directed by David McVicar, at Glyndebourne in 2005, 2006 and 2009, and in the same production at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 2007. At the end of 2006, when De Nederlandse Opera staged the three Mozart-Da Ponte operas conducted by Ingo Metzmacher, de Niese sang Susanna in Le nozze di Figaro and Despina in Così fan tutte. In 2009, de Niese made her Covent Garden debut in The Royal Opera's production of Handel's Acis and Galatea, directed by choreographer Wayne McGregor and recorded on DVD.
Beginning on 31 December 2011 and continuing through January 2012, de Niese appeared as Ariel in The Enchanted Island, a pastiche opera created by Jeremy Sams for the Metropolitan Opera. The performance on January 21 was broadcast worldwide as a MET HD video transmission.
De Niese (called Danni by her friends and colleagues) married Gus Christie, grandson of John Christie and chairman of Glyndebourne Festival Opera,[6] on 19 December 2009 in St Bartholomew-the-Great, London.[7] Since her marriage she has lived at Glyndebourne in Sussex, England.

The Australian-born, lyric soprano, Danielle de Niese, was born in Melbourne,  after her parents, Chris and Beverly, had migrated from Sri Lanka to Australia as teenagers - she is of Sri Lankan and Dutch heritage. In 1988, at the age of 9, she became the youngest ever winner of the Australian TV programme Young Talent Time, singing a Whitney Houston medley, for which the prize was A$ 5,000 and a Yamaha baby-grand piano, which she still possesses. In 1990, her family moved to Los Angeles. She has been captivating audiences since childhood, when she was a fixture of Los Angeles local television hosting a weekly arts showcase for teenagers, L.A. Kids, for which she won an Emmy Award at the age of 16. Trained in dance and piano as well as music at the famed Colburn School in Los Angeles, she participated in the Tanglewood, Aspen and Marlboro summer programmes before going to New York in 1997 to attend the Mannes School for Music.
Danielle de Niese made her professional operatic debut at the age of 15 with the Los Angeles Opera. Her career got off to a prestigious start when, at 18, she became the youngest singer ever to enter the Metropolitan Opera's Lindemann Young Artist Development Program. A year later, at the age of 19, she made her house debut as Barbarina in a new Jonathan Miller production of Le nozze di Figaro in a cast featuring Renée Fleming, Bryn Terfel and Cecilia Bartoli, and led by James Levine. She was subsequently asked to perform the title role in the Met's production of Maurice Ravel's L'enfant et les sortilèges. Other Met roles include Cleopatra in Giulio Cesare (2007), Euridice in Orfeo ed Euridice (2009), and Susanna in the same production of Le Nozze di Figaro in which she sang Barbarina in 1998. The New York Times hailed De Niese's performance, writing, "Her singing is utterly delectable and completely assured ... Sheer 'joie de vivre' and mastery come spilling across, to the eyes as well as the ears."
Soon after here Met debut, came important operatic debuts with the Netherlands Opera, Saito Kinen Festival and Paris Opera. But it was her portrayal of Cleopatra in a David McVicar production of George Frideric Handel's Giulio Cesare for her 2005 Glyndebourne Festival debut that brought her true international acclaim. She appeared in the same production at Glyndebourne also in 2006 and 2009, and at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 2007. Danielle de Niese's still growing career has ranged through early Baroque music (Poppea in L'incoronazione di Poppea), via G.F. Handel, Mozart and contemporary opera premieres (RAAFF by Robin de Raaff, 2004, De Nederlandse Opera) at major opera houses around the world, to Broadway (Les Misérables) and film (Hannibal) roles. She has appeared in productions of a number of Baroque operas on stage and on DVD, for example the Les Arts Florissants production of Les Indes galantes by Jean-Philippe Rameau. At the end of 2006, when De Nederlandse Opera staged the three Mozart/Da Ponte operas conducted by Ingo Metzmacher, de Niese sang Susanna in Le nozze di Figaro and Despina in Così fan tutte.
With her "sweet, gleaming soprano", "phenomenal musicality" and "sharply comic, yet utterly moving" acting, combined with youth and physical presence, Danielle de Niese regularly graces many of the world's most prestigious opera and concert stages. She has enjoyed operatic successes on the stages of the Paris Opera, Zürich Opera, Netherlands Opera, San Francisco Opera and Lyric Opera of Chicago, among many others. Orchestral engagements have included appearances with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, National Symphony Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields.
In the 2009-2010 season Danielle de Niese returned to the Metropolitan Opera in the same production of Le nozze di Figaro in which she made her house debut, but this time as Susanna. Other important opera engagements included L'incoronazione di Poppea with the Teatro Real, G.F. Handel's Semele at the Theâtre des Champs-Élysees, and Giulio Cesare at the Glyndebourne Festival, as well as Susanna in Le nozze di Figaro with the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Additionally, she toured Europe with the period-instrument ensemble Il Giardino Armonico in an all-Handel programme. Danielle de Niese's 2010-2011 season began with appearances as Susanna in Le nozze di Figaro with the San Francisco Opera under Nicola Luisotti, continuing at the Metropolitan Opera as Despina in Così fan tutte, with William Christie conducting, and at Vienna's Theater an der Wien in the title role of G.F. Handel's Rodelinda under Nikolaus Harnoncourt. She returns to the Glyndebourne Festival in June 2011 for her first performances as Adina in L'Elisir d'amore.
The Netherlands Opera awarded Danielle de Niese their "Prix d'Amis" as their audiences' choice of the past season's favourite performer. She has an exclusive recording contract with Decca. She is the recipient of the 2008 Echo Award's New Artist of the Year, as well as the 2008 Orphee d'or given by the Academie du Disque Lyrique for her 2007 debut album, Handel Arias. Her much-lauded second recording, The Mozart Album, followed in 2009, and Diva was released in July 2010 in the UK. Beauty of the Baroque, an album of favourite arias from the English, German, and Italian traditions, accompanied by the The English Concert under Harry Bicket, will appear in June 2011.

	Through her recordings, live performance, and television exposure, de Niese has gained wide recognition as a highly respected but popular classical artist, who combines effortless grace with the ability to communicate on every level. She is as comfortable on the small screen as she is on stage with no fewer than four BBC TV projects in the pipeline.  She appeared on ITV1’s recent Popstar to Operastar series, and she is also the subject of her own TV documentary, Diva Diaries, which appeared on BBC4 television. In the United States, she has been featured on the nationally syndicated program Better TV.

	Highlights of her 2012-13 season included an impromptu performance of her Cleopatra in David McVicar’s production of Giulio Cesare at The Metropolitan Opera. Ms. de Niese also appeared with the London Philharmonic and the Prague Philharmonia, and made her London recital debut for Temple Song Foundation at Middle Temple in London with Julius Drake, her German operatic debut as Susanna in a production of Le nozze de Figaro at Hamburg State Opera, as well as the role of Norina in a the sold out new production of Donizetti’s Don Pasquale at Glyndebourne Festival Opera this summer conducted by Enrique Mazzola.

	Born to parents of Sri Lankan and Dutch heritage, Danielle de Niese grew up in Los Angeles. The soprano has been captivating audiences since childhood, when she was a fixture of Los Angeles local television hosting a weekly arts showcase for teenagers, for which she won an Emmy award at the age of 16. In addition to her accomplished musical abilities, Ms. de Niese passionately pursues philanthropic causes including working closely with HRH Prince Charles and his Foundation for Children and the Arts to spearhead new opera projects for underprivileged children as well as participating as a patron alongside Dame Judi Dench for Future Talent which gives financial support and guidance to underprivileged young musicians. Ms. de Niese is also a patron of Meads Music Festival in her local region of East Sussex, an Artist Member of the Mannes Board of Govenors alongside Frederica von Stade, Murray Perahia, Richard Goode, Julius Rudel, and Gordon Getty, and the Sunera Foundation and Sri Lanka Trauma Foundation providing mental and physical rehabilitation to physically handicapped, or mentally traumatised children post-Tsunami and the Civil War.
"Her singing is utterly delectable and completely assured…Sheer ‘joie de vivre’ and mastery come spilling across, to the eyes as well as the ears."
"A performer of charismatic good looks and stage presence, she won the audience equally by her singing of the Egyptian queen’s varied sequence of arias."
"With de Niese around, not much else matters. She's a natural stage animal, relishing movement besides sound and socking out the glitter of the coquettish heroine's coloratura, the higher and more brilliant the better. At first, Adina totes a rifle and sharpens knives; later, clad in wedding meringue, her heart opens – and she throws a terrific tantrum, too. De Niese made her intelligent, honest, ultimately compassionate."

                    Raised in Melbourne and Los Angeles, soprano Danielle de Niese was already a veteran singer by the time she began her studies at Mannes College of Music. She had made her operatic debut with the Los Angeles Opera at 15, and won several music scholarships, not to mention a local Emmy Award, while in high school. De Niese was the youngest entrant to date in the Metropolitan Opera's Lindemann Young Artist Development Program, making her Met debut in 1998 in Le nozze di Figaro, directed by Jonathan Miller. She was judged by Terry Teachout of the New York Daily News as "…clearly headed for bigger and better things."                 
                    Although she was an ensemble member of the Broadway cast of Les Misérables while still a student, De Niese is most comfortable in the Baroque and Classical repertoire, which she began studying while a teenager. Her recordings for Decca and her stage roles are rooted in the music of those eras. Even the contemporary piece written for her appearance on the soundtrack of the Ridley Scott film Hannibal has similarly clear, melodic lines. Her first solo album, Handel Arias (2007), was extremely well received. She has appeared notably as Cleopatra in Handel's Giulio Cesare at Glyndebourne in 2005; in several BBC television programs; and, in early 2012, as Ariel in The Enchanted Island, a new pastiche opera based on the music of Baroque masters produced by the Metropolitan Opera.
