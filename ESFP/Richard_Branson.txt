Sir Richard Charles Nicholas Branson (born 18 July 1950) is an English business magnate and investor. He is best known as the founder of Virgin Group, which comprises more than 400 companies.[3]
At the age of sixteen his first business venture was a magazine called Student.[4] In 1970, he set up a mail-order record business. In 1972, he opened a chain of record stores, Virgin Records, later known as Virgin Megastores. Branson's Virgin brand grew rapidly during the 1980s, as he set up Virgin Atlantic and expanded the Virgin Records music label.
According to the Forbes 2012 list of billionaires, Branson is the sixth richest citizen of the United Kingdom, with an estimated net worth of US$4.6 billion.[1]
Branson was born in Blackheath, London. His father was barrister Edward James Branson (10 March 1918 – 19 March 2011).[5][6] His grandfather, the Right Honourable Sir George Arthur Harwin Branson, was a judge of the High Court of Justice and a Privy Councillor.[7] Branson was educated at Scaitcliffe School (now Bishopsgate School)[8] until the age of thirteen. He then attended Stowe School until the age of sixteen. Branson had dyslexia and had poor academic performance as a student, but later discovered his ability to connect with others.[9] On one of Branson's last days at school, his headmaster, Robert Drayson, told him he would either end up in prison or become a millionaire.[10]
Branson's parents were supportive of his endeavors from an early age. When 15-year-old Richard decided to breed budgies and persuaded his father to build a huge aviary, his father built it. Branson's parents have been described as encouraging.[11]

Richard Branson started his record business from the crypt of a church where he ran The Student magazine. Branson advertised popular records in The Student and it was an overnight success. Trading under the name "Virgin", he sold records for considerably less than the "High Street" outlets, especially the chain, W. H. Smith. Branson once said, "There is no point in starting your own business unless you do it out of a sense of frustration." The name "Virgin" was suggested by one of Branson's early employees because they were all new at business.[12] At the time, many products were sold under restrictive marketing agreements that limited discounting, despite efforts in the 1950s and 1960s to limit so-called resale price maintenance.[13] In effect, Branson began the series of changes that led to large-scale discounting of recorded music.
Branson eventually started a record shop in Oxford Street in London. In 1971, Branson was questioned in connection with the selling of records in Virgin stores that had been declared export stock. The matter was never brought before a court and Branson agreed to repay any unpaid tax and a fine. Branson's mother, Eve, re-mortgaged the family home to help pay the settlement.[12]
Earning enough money from his record store, Branson in 1972 launched the record label Virgin Records with Nik Powell and bought a country estate, in which he installed a recording studio. He leased out studio time to fledgling artists, including multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield, whose debut album Tubular Bells (1973) was the first release for Virgin Records and it became a chart-topping best-seller.
Virgin signed such controversial bands as the Sex Pistols, which other companies were reluctant to sign. It also won praise for exposing the public to such obscure avant-garde music as Faust and Can. Virgin Records also introduced Culture Club to the music world. In the early 1980s, Virgin purchased the gay nightclub, Heaven. In 1991, in a consortium with David Frost, Richard Branson has made the unsuccessful bid for three ITV franchisees under the CPV-TV name. The early 1980s also saw his only attempt as a producer—on the novelty record, "Baa, Baa, Black Sheep", by Singing Sheep in association with Doug McLean and Grace McDonald. The recording was a series of sheep baa-ing along to a drum-machine-produced track and reached number 42 in the UK charts in 1982.
In 1992, to keep his airline company afloat, Branson sold the Virgin label to EMI for £500 million.[14] Branson said that he wept when the sale was completed because the record business had been the very start of the Virgin empire. He later created V2 Records to re-enter the music business.[15]
Branson formed Virgin Atlantic Airways in 1984, launched Virgin Mobile in 1999, and Virgin Blue in Australia (now named Virgin Australia) in 2000. He was ninth in the Sunday Times Rich List 2006, worth slightly more than £3 billion. Branson wrote in his autobiography of the decision to start an airline:
My interest in life comes from setting myself huge, apparently unachievable challenges and trying to rise above them ... from the perspective of wanting to live life to the full, I felt that I had to attempt it.
In 1993, Branson took what many saw as being one of his riskier business exploits by entering into the railway business. Virgin Trains won the franchises for the former Intercity West Coast and Cross-Country sectors of British Rail.
Virgin acquired European short-haul airline Euro Belgian Airlines in 1996 and renamed it Virgin Express. In 2006, the airline was merged with SN Brussels Airlines forming Brussels Airlines. It also started a national airline based in Nigeria, called Virgin Nigeria. Another airline, Virgin America, began flying out of San Francisco International Airport in August 2007. Branson has also developed a Virgin Cola brand and even a Virgin Vodka brand, which has not been a very successful enterprise. As a consequence of these lacklustre performers, the satirical British fortnightly magazine Private Eye has been critical of Branson and his companies (see Private Eye image caption).[16]
A series of disputes in the early 1990s caused tension between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways, which viewed Virgin as an emerging competitor. Virgin subsequently accused British Airways of poaching its passengers, hacking its computers, and leaking stories to the press that portrayed Virgin negatively. After the so-called campaign of "dirty tricks", British Airways settled the case, giving £500,000 to Branson, a further £110,000 to his airline, and had to pay legal fees of up to £3million . Branson distributed his compensation (the so-called "BA bonus") among his staff.[17]
On 25 September 2004, Branson announced the signing of a deal under which a new space tourism company, Virgin Galactic, will license the technology behind Spaceship One—funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and designed by legendary American aeronautical engineer and visionary Burt Rutan—to take paying passengers into suborbital space. Virgin Galactic (wholly owned by Virgin Group) plans to make flights available to the public with tickets priced at US$200,000 using Scaled Composites White Knight Two.[18] Branson plans to take his two children, 31-year-old Holly and 28-year-old Sam, on a trip to outer space when they ride the SpaceShipTwo rocket plane on its first public flight planned for 2014.[19]
Branson's next venture with the Virgin group is Virgin Fuels, which is set to respond to global warming and exploit the recent spike in fuel costs by offering a revolutionary, cheaper fuel for automobiles and, in the near future, aircraft. Branson has stated that he was formerly a global warming sceptic and was influenced in his decision by a breakfast meeting with Al Gore.[20]
Branson has been tagged as a "transformational leader" in the management lexicon, with his maverick strategies and his stress on the Virgin Group as an organisation driven on informality and information, one that is bottom-heavy rather than strangled by top-level management.
On 21 September 2006, Branson pledged to invest the profits of Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Trains in research for environmentally friendly fuels. The investment is estimated to be worth $3 billion.[21][22]
On 4 July 2006, Branson sold his Virgin Mobile company to UK cable TV, broadband, and telephone company NTL/NTL:Telewest for almost £1 billion. A new company was launched with much fanfare and publicity on 8 February 2007, under the name Virgin Media. The decision to merge his Virgin Media Company with NTL was to integrate both of the companies' compatible parts of commerce. Branson used to own three-quarters of Virgin Mobile, whereas now he owns 15 percent of the new Virgin Media company.[23]
In 2006, Branson formed Virgin Comics and Virgin Animation, an entertainment company focused on creating new stories and characters for a global audience. The company was founded with author Deepak Chopra, filmmaker Shekhar Kapur, and entrepreneurs Sharad Devarajan and Gotham Chopra.
Branson also launched the Virgin Health Bank on 1 February 2007, offering parents-to-be the opportunity to store their baby's umbilical cord blood stem cells in private and public stem cell banks.
In June 2006, a tip-off from Virgin Atlantic led US and UK competition authorities to investigate price-fixing attempts between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways. In August 2007, British Airways was fined £271 million over the allegations. Virgin Atlantic was given immunity for tipping off the authorities and received no fine—a controversial decision the Office of Fair Trading defended as being in the public interest.[24]
On 9 February 2007, Branson announced the setting up of a new Global science and technology prize—The Virgin Earth Challenge—in the belief that history has shown that prizes of this nature encourage technological advancements for the good of mankind. The Virgin Earth Challenge will award $25 million to the individual or group who are able to demonstrate a commercially viable design that will result in the net removal of anthropogenic, atmospheric greenhouse gases each year for at least ten years without countervailing harmful effects. This removal must have long-term effects and contribute materially to the stability of the Earth's climate.
Branson also announced that he would be joined in the adjudication of the prize by a panel of five judges, all world authorities in their respective fields: Al Gore, Sir Crispin Tickell, Tim Flannery, James E. Hansen, and James Lovelock. The panel of judges will be assisted in their deliberations by The Climate Group and Special Advisor to The Virgin Earth Prize Judges, Steve Howard.
On 13 October 2007, Branson's Virgin Group sought to add Northern Rock to its empire after submitting an offer that would result in Branson personally owning 30% of the company and change the company's name from Northern Rock to Virgin Money.[26] The Daily Mail ran a campaign against his bid and Vince Cable, financial spokesperson for Liberal Democrats', suggested in the House of Commons that Branson's criminal conviction for tax evasion might be felt by some as a good enough reason not to trust him with public money.[27]
On 10 January 2008, Branson's Virgin Healthcare announced that it would open a chain of health care clinics that would offer conventional medical care alongside homoeopathic and complementary therapies, a development that was welcomed by Ben Bradshaw, the UK's health minister.[28]
Plans where GPs could be paid for referring National Health Service (NHS) patients to private Virgin services were abandoned in June 2008. The BMA warned the plan would "damage clinical objectivity", there would be a financial incentive for GPs to push patients toward the Virgin services at the centre.[29] Plans to take over an NHS Practice in Swindon were abandoned subsequently, in late September 2008.[30]
In February 2009, Branson's Virgin organisation were reported as bidding to buy the former Honda Formula One team. Branson later stated an interest in Formula One, but claimed that, before the Virgin brand became involved with Honda or any other team, Formula One would have to develop a more economically efficient and environmentally responsible image. At the start of the 2009 formula one season on 28 March, it was announced that Virgin would be sponsoring the new Brawn GP team,[31] with discussions also under way about introducing a less "dirty" fuel in the medium term.[32] After the end of the season and the subsequent purchase of Brawn GP by Mercedes Benz, Branson invested in an 80% buyout of Manor Grand Prix,[33][34] with the team being renamed to Virgin Racing.
Branson and Tony Fernandes, owner of Air Asia and Lotus F1 Racing, had a bet for the 2010 F1 season where the team's boss should work on the winner's airline during a charity flight dressed as a stewardess. Fernandes escaped as the winner of the bet, as Lotus Racing ended tenth in the championship, while Virgin Racing ended twelfth and last. Branson kept his word after losing the bet, as he served his duty as a stewardess on an Air Asia flight between Perth and Kuala Lumpur on 12 May 2013.[35]
Branson and Somerset County's Natirar Resort development in New Jersey, on the Natirar Estate, opened in late 2009 with the Ninety Acres Culinary Center. It includes a restaurant run by chef David Felton, cooking school, wine school, working farm, luxury resort, and spa. The development, spearheaded by Branson and Bob Wojtowicz, sits on 500 acres which was the former estate of the King of Morocco.[36]
In 2010, Richard Branson became patron of the UK's Gordon Bennett 2010 gas balloon race, which has 16 hydrogen balloons flying across Europe.[37]
In April 2010, Branson described the closure of large parts of European airspace owing to volcanic ash as "beyond a joke". Some scientists later concluded that serious structural damage to aircraft could have occurred if passenger planes had continued to fly.[38]
In July 2012, Branson announced plans to build an orbital space launch system, designated LauncherOne.[39] Four commercial customers have already contracted for launches and two companies are developing standardised satellite buses optimised to the design of LauncherOne, in expectation of business opportunities created by the new smallsat launcher.[40]
In August 2012, the franchise for the West Coast Main Line, managed by Virgin Rail since 1997, came to an end. The contract was awarded to FirstGroup after a competitive tender process overseen by the Department for Transport. Branson had expressed his concerns about the tender process and questioned the validity of the business plan submitted by FirstGroup. When Virgin Rail lost the contract, Branson said he was convinced the civil servants had "got their maths wrong". In October, after an investigation into the bidding process, the deal was scrapped. The Transport Secretary announced there were "significant technical flaws" in the process and mistakes had been made by transport staff. Virgin Rail continue to operate the West Coast line.[41]

A 1998 attempt at an around-the-world balloon flight by Branson, Fossett, and Lindstrand ends in the Pacific Ocean on 25 December 1998.
Richard Branson made several world record-breaking attempts after 1985, when in the spirit of the Blue Riband he attempted the fastest Atlantic Ocean crossing. His first attempt in the "Virgin Atlantic Challenger" led to the boat capsizing in British waters and a rescue by RAF helicopter, which received wide media coverage. Some newspapers called for Branson to reimburse the government for the rescue cost. In 1986, in his "Virgin Atlantic Challenger II", with sailing expert Daniel McCarthy, he beat the record by two hours.[4] A year later his hot air balloon "Virgin Atlantic Flyer" crossed the Atlantic.
In January 1991, Branson crossed the Pacific from Japan to Arctic Canada, 6,700 miles (10,800 km), in a balloon of 2,600,000 cubic feet (74,000 m3). This broke the record, with a speed of 245 miles per hour (394 km/h).
Between 1995 and 1998 Branson, Per Lindstrand and Steve Fossett made attempts to circumnavigate the globe by balloon. In late 1998 they made a record-breaking flight from Morocco to Hawaii but were unable to complete a global flight before Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones in Breitling Orbiter 3 in March 1999.
In March 2004, Branson set a record by travelling from Dover to Calais in a Gibbs Aquada in 1 hour, 40 minutes and 6 seconds, the fastest crossing of the English Channel in an amphibious vehicle. The previous record of six hours was set by two Frenchmen.[42] The cast of Top Gear, Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, attempted to break this record in an amphibious vehicle which they had constructed and, while successfully crossing the channel, did not break Branson's record. They were intercepted by a Coast Guard aircraft along the way, but after Clarkson remarked "We're trying to beat 'Beardy' Branson!" the Coast Guard wished them good luck, and left.[citation needed]
In September 2008, Branson and his children made an unsuccessful attempt at an Eastbound record crossing of the Atlantic ocean under sail in the 99 feet (30 m) sloop Virgin Money.[43] The boat, also known as Speedboat, is owned by NYYC member Alex Jackson, who was a co-skipper on this passage, with Branson and Mike Sanderson. After 2 days, 4 hours, winds of force 7 to 9 (strong gale), and seas of 40 feet (12 m), a 'monster wave' destroyed the spinnaker, washed a ten-man life raft overboard and severely ripped the mainsail. She eventually continued to St. George's, Bermuda.[44]
Branson has guest starred, usually playing himself, on several television shows, including Friends, Baywatch, Birds of a Feather, Only Fools and Horses, The Day Today, a special episode of the comedy Goodness Gracious Me and Tripping Over. Branson made several appearances during the nineties on the BBC Saturday morning show Live & Kicking, where he was referred to as 'the pickle man' by comedy act Trev and Simon (in reference to Branston Pickle).[45] Branson also appears in a cameo early in XTC's "Generals and Majors" video.
He was also the star of a reality television show on Fox called The Rebel Billionaire: Branson's Quest for the Best (2004), in which sixteen contestants were tested for their entrepreneurship and sense of adventure. It did not succeed as a rival show to Donald Trump's The Apprentice and only lasted one season.
His high public profile often leaves him open as a figure of satire—the 2000 AD series Zenith features a parody of Branson as a super villain, as the comic's publisher and favoured distributor and the Virgin group were in competition at the time. He is also caricatured in The Simpsons episode "Monty Can't Buy Me Love" as the tycoon Arthur Fortune, and as the ballooning megalomaniac Richard Chutney (a pun on Branson, as in Branston Pickle) in Believe Nothing. The character Grandson Richard 39 in Terry Pratchett's Wings is modelled on Branson.
He has a cameo appearance in several films: Around the World in 80 Days (2004), where he played a hot-air balloon operator; Superman Returns, where he was credited as a 'Shuttle Engineer' and appeared alongside his son, Sam, with a Virgin Galactic-style commercial suborbital shuttle at the centre of his storyline. He also has a cameo in the James Bond film Casino Royale. Here, he is seen as a passenger going through Miami Airport security check-in and being frisked – several Virgin Atlantic planes appear soon after. British Airways edited out Branson's cameo in their in-flight screening of the movie.[46]
He makes a number of brief and disjointed appearances in the cult classic documentary Derek and Clive Get the Horn which follows the exploits of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore recording their last comedy album. Branson and his mother were also featured in the documentary film, Lemonade Stories. In early 2006 on Rove Live, Rove McManus and Sir Richard pushed each other into a swimming pool fully clothed live on TV during a "Live at your house" episode.
Branson is a Star Trek fan and named his new spaceship VSS Enterprise in honour of the famous Star Trek ships, and in 2006, reportedly offered actor William Shatner a ride on the inaugural space launch of Virgin Galactic. In an interview in Time magazine, 10 August 2009, Shatner claimed that Branson approached him asking how much he would pay for a ride on the spaceship. In response, Shatner asked "how much would you pay me to do it?"
In August 2007, Branson announced on The Colbert Report that he had named a new aircraft Air Colbert. He later doused political satirist and talk show host Stephen Colbert with water from his mug. Branson subsequently took a retaliatory splash from Colbert. The interview quickly ended, with both laughing[47] as shown on the episode aired on Comedy Central on 22 August 2007. The interview was promoted on The Report as the Colbert-Branson Interview Trainwreck. Branson then made a cameo appearance on The Soup playing an intern working under Joel McHale who had been warned against getting into water fights with Stephen Colbert, and being subsequently fired.
In March 2008 he launched Virgin Mobile in India and during that period, he even played a cameo performance in Bollywood film, London Dreams.[48]
In July 2010, Branson narrated Australian sailor Jessica Watson's documentary about her solo sailing trip around the world. It premiered on ONEHD on 16 August 2010.[citation needed]
In April 2011 Branson appeared on CNN's Mainsail[49] with Kate Winslet. Together they re-enacted a famous scene[50] from the 1997 film Titanic for the cameras. On 17 August 2011, he was featured in the premier episode of Hulu's first long-form original production entitled, A Day in the Life.[51]
At the 2012 Pride of Britain Awards broadcast on ITV on 30 October, Branson, along with Michael Caine, Elton John, Simon Cowell and Stephen Fry, recited Rudyard Kipling's poem If— in tribute to the 2012 British Olympic and Paralympics heroes.[52]
In the late 1990s, Branson and musician Peter Gabriel discussed with Nelson Mandela their idea of a small, dedicated group of leaders, working objectively and without any vested personal interest to solve difficult global conflicts.[54]
On 18 July 2007, in Johannesburg, South Africa, Nelson Mandela announced the formation of a new group, The Elders, in a speech he delivered on the occasion of his 89th birthday. Kofi Annan serves as Chair of The Elders and Gro Harlem Brundtland as Deputy Chair. The other members of the group are Martti Ahtisaari, Ela Bhatt, Lakhdar Brahimi, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Jimmy Carter, Hina Jilani, Graça Machel, Mary Robinson and Ernesto Zedillo. Desmond Tutu is an Honorary Elder. Nelson Mandela was an Honorary Elder. The Elders is independently funded by a group of donors, including Branson and Gabriel.
The Elders use their collective skills to catalyse peaceful resolutions to long-standing conflicts, articulate new approaches to global issues that are causing or may cause immense human suffering, and share wisdom by helping to connect voices all over the world. They work together to carefully consider which specific issues they will approach.
Branson's other work in South Africa includes the Branson School of Entrepreneurship, set up in 2005 as a partnership between Virgin Unite, the non-profit foundation of Virgin, and entrepreneur Taddy Blecher, the founder of CIDA City Campus, a university in Johannesburg. The school aims to improve economic growth in South Africa by supporting start-ups and micro-enterprises with skills, mentors, services, networks and finance arrangements.[55] Fundraising activity to support the school is notably achieved by the Sunday Times Fast Track 100, sponsored by Virgin Group, at its yearly event, where places to join Richard Branson on trips to South Africa to provide coaching and mentoring to students are auctioned to attendees. In 2009, Jason Luckhurst and Boyd Kershaw of Practicus, Martin Ainscough of the Ainscough Group and Matthew Riley of Daisy Communications helped raise £150,000 through the auction.[56]
In September 2007, Richard Branson chaired the jury of the first Picnic Green Challenge, a €500,000 award for best new green initiative, set up by the Dutch "Postcode Loterij" (postcode lottery) and the PICNIC Network of creative professionals. The first Green Challenge was won by Qurrent with the Qbox.
Branson was the first celebrity guest for the popular charity fund raisers, Reserve Dinners, raising over $75,000 in one evening towards his Virgin Unite charity.[57]
In March 2008, Richard Branson hosted an environmental gathering at his private island, Necker Island, in the Caribbean with several prominent entrepreneurs, celebrities, and world leaders. They discussed global warming-related problems facing the world, hoping that this meeting will be a precursor to many more future discussions regarding similar problems. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, and Larry Page of Google were in attendance.[58]
Branson has been very supportive of Kenya during its troubles, and in May 2008 had gone to Masai Mara to open a new school (Sekenani Primary School) which has also been partly funded by Virgin Atlantic frequent flyers who volunteered their time to help with the construction. A documentary of the experience was directed by Carolyn Scott-Hamilton and filmed by David Collupy.
On 8 May 2009, Branson took over Mia Farrow's hunger strike for 3 days in protest of the Sudanese government expulsion of aid groups from the Darfur region.[59]
Richard Branson is a signatory of Global Zero (campaign), a non-profit international initiative for the elimination of all nuclear weapons worldwide.[60] Since its launch in Paris in December 2008,[61] Global Zero (campaign) has grown to 300 leaders, including current and former heads of state, national security officials and military commanders, and 400,000 citizens worldwide; developed a practical step-by-step plan to eliminate nuclear weapons; launched an international student campaign with 75 campus chapters in eight countries; and produced an acclaimed documentary film, Countdown to Zero, in partnership with Lawrence Bender and Participant Media.[62]
Since 2010, Branson has served as a Commissioner on the Broadband Commission for Digital Development, a UN initiative which promotes universal access to broadband services.[63]
In 2011, Branson served on the Global Commission on Drug Policy with former political and cultural leaders of Latin America and elsewhere, "in a bid to boost the effort to achieve more humane and rational drug laws."[64]
In December, 2013 Branson urged companies to boycott Uganda because of their "anti-homosexuality bill." Branson stated that it would be "against my conscience to support this country...governments must realize that people should be able to love whoever they want."[65]
In the 1980s, Branson was briefly given the post of "litter Tsar" by Margaret Thatcher—charged with "keeping Britain tidy".[66][67] In 2005 he declared that there were only negligible differences between the two main parties on economic matters.[68] He has frequently been mentioned as a candidate for Mayor of London, and polls have suggested he would be a viable candidate, though he has yet to express interest.[69][70][71] He supports continuing British membership of the European Union and opposes having a referendum on the issue.[72]
Branson's business empire is owned by a complicated series of offshore trusts and companies. The Sunday Times stated that his wealth is calculated at £3 billion; if he were to retire to his Caribbean island and liquidate all of this, he would pay relatively little in tax.[73] Branson has been criticised for his business strategy, and has been accused of being a carpetbagger.[74][75][76][77] Branson responded that he is living on Necker for health rather than tax reasons.[78]
In 1993, Branson was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Technology from Loughborough University.
In the New Years Honours list dated 30 December 1999, Elizabeth II signified her intention to confer the honour of Knight Bachelor on him for his "services to entrepreneurship".[79][80] He was knighted by Charles, Prince of Wales on 30 March 2000 at an investiture in Buckingham Palace.[81]
Also in 2000, Branson received the 'Tony Jannus Award' for his accomplishments in commercial air transportation.
Branson is the patron of several charities, including the International Rescue Corps and Prisoners Abroad, a registered charity which supports Britons who are detained outside the UK.
Branson appears at No. 85 on the 2002 list of "100 Greatest Britons" (sponsored by the BBC and voted for by the public). Branson was also ranked in 2007's Time Magazine "Top 100 Most Influential People in the World". In 2009, Branson was voted the UK's "Celebrity Dream Boss" in an opinion poll by Cancer Research UK.[82]
On 7 December 2007, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon presented Branson with the United Nations Correspondents Association Citizen of the World Award for his support for environmental and humanitarian causes.[83]
On 24 January 2011, Branson was awarded the German Media Prize (organised by "Media Control Charts"), previously handed to former US president Bill Clinton and the Dalai Lama.
On 14 November 2011, Branson was awarded the ISTA Prize by the International Space Transport Association in The Hague for his pioneering achievements in the development of suborbital transport systems with "Virgin Galactic".[84]
On 11 February 2012, Branson was honoured with the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences' President's Merit Award for his contributions to the music industry. The event took place the night before the 54th Grammy Awards.[85]
On 2 June 2013, Branson received an honorary degree of Doctor Honoris Causa from Kaunas Technology University in Kaunas, Lithuania.[86]
On 15 May 2014, Branson received the 2014 Business for Peace Award, awarded annually by the Business for Peace Foundation in Oslo, Norway.[87]
Branson has a daughter named Holly and a son named Sam. He stated in an interview with Piers Morgan that he and wife Joan had a daughter named Clare Sarah who died when she was just four days old in 1979.[88] The couple wed—at their daughter Holly's suggestion when she was eight years old—in 1989 at Necker Island, a 74-acre (30 ha) island owned by Branson in the British Virgin Islands.[89]
In 1998, Branson released his autobiography, titled Losing My Virginity, an international best-seller.[90]
Branson was deeply saddened by the disappearance of fellow adventurer Steve Fossett in September 2007; the following month he wrote an article for Time magazine, titled "My Friend, Steve Fossett".[91]
Branson has stated in a number of interviews that he derives much influence from non-fiction books. He most commonly names Nelson Mandela's autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, explaining that Mandela was "one of the most inspiring men I have ever met and had the honour to call my friend." Owing to his interest in humanitarian and ecological issues, Branson also lists Al Gore's best-selling book, An Inconvenient Truth, and The Revenge of Gaia by James Lovelock amongst his favourites. According to Branson's book, Screw It, Let's do It. Lessons in Life, he is also a huge fan of works by Jung Chang.[92]

                This flamboyant British entrepreneur with a seemingly insatiable appetite for starting new businesses is the son of a lawyer and an airline stewardess.He was educated at the exclusive Stowe School but did not excel, possibly due to his nearsightedness and dyslexia. In his teens he developed a national magazine, Student at the Age of Sixteen. At seventeen he began a student advisory service.  After leaving school, Branson entered the music industry. Considering that he could sell records cheaper than the existing average, he started a mail-order catalogue with friends. It was a success, and they opened a record discount shop. They named the business Virgin, because it was their first venture.  Virgin Records was formed in 1972. The first recording studio was built in Oxfordshire, England. Mike Oldfield recorded the very first album, and it sold over five million copies. When punk came along, Virgin signed the outrageous Sex Pistols when other record companies refused to touch them. The move turned out to be a marketing coup.  Virgin Airlines is one of Richard Branson's main businesses. Formed in 1984, it is part owned by Singapore Airlines, and it is the second largest British long haul international airline, and has won many awards.  To keep his airline afloat, Branson sold the Virgin music label to EMI in 1992, a more conservative company which previously had rescinded a contract with the Sex Pistols.  Branson apparently wept when the sale was completed since the record business had been the genesis of his Virgin Empire.  In 1994, Sir Richard made a bid to run the National Lottery, promising to give all the profits to charity, and lost. He failed with a second bid five years later.  In 1997, Branson took over some of Britain's aging railway network, under the title Virgin Rail. Despite the introduction of new trains, the network is still dogged by delays and service interruptions. More recently Branson has founded a mobile phone network, an internet company, and a Cola, unsurprisingly titled Virgin Cola.  In 2006, Branson sold his Virgin Mobile company to telecoms company NTL:Telewest for £1 billion. As part of the sale, the company pays a minimum of £8.5 million per year to use the Virgin name and Branson became the company's largest shareholder. The new company was launched with much fanfare in February 2007, under the name Virgin Media.  On 9 February 2007, Branson announced the Virgin Earth Challenge, which awards $25 million to an individual or team that designs a viable product that will reduce greenhouse gases each year for at least ten years without any harmful effects. Over 2,600 applications were made and 11 finalists were revealed on 2 November 2011.  In 2007, Branson also bought a ten per cent stake in Malaysian airline AirAsia X and bid to buy a 30 per cent stake in Northern Rock, which failed.  However, Branson was able to takeover Northern Rock for £747 million at the end of 2011, with the deal being finalised on 1 January 2012. He has now launched Virgin Money, with a range of new products yet to be announced.  Branson expanded his healthcare empire in 2008 by opening health care clinics offering traditional medical treatment as well as homeopathy under the name Virgin Healthcare.  At the start of the Formula One racing season in 2009, Branson announced that Virgin was sponsoring the new Brawn GP team. At the end of the season, the team became Virgin Racing.  According to the Forbes 2011 list of billionaires, Branson is the fourth richest British citizen and 254th richest person in the world.  Branson is also well known for his personal adventures. In 1987 Branson crossed the Atlantic Ocean in the "Virgin Atlantic Flyer", which was the first and largest hot air balloon to cross the ocean. Branson now plans to circle the world in his hot air balloon, and has made several unsuccessful attempts.  Richard Branson received a knighthood in 1999. He is married to Joan and has two children, Holly and Sam.

      Richard Branson was born in 1950 and educated at Stowe School. It was here that he began to set up Student Magazine when he was just 16. By 17 he'd also set up Student Advisory Centre, which was a charity to help young people. In 1970 he founded Virgin as a mail order record retailer, and not long after he opened a record shop in Oxford Street, London. During 1972 a recording studio was built in Oxfordshire, and the first Virgin artist, Mike Oldfield, recorded "Tubular Bells" which was released in 1973. This album went on to sell over 5 million copies. Since then many household names, including Belinda Carlisle, Genesis, Phil Collins, Janet Jackson and The Rolling Stones have helped to make Virgin Music one of the top six record companies in the world. The equity of Virgin Music Group - record labels, music publishing, and recording studios was sold to THORN EMI in 1992 in a US$1billion deal. The Virgin Group has now expanded into international music Megastores, air travel, mobile, financial, retail, music, internet, drinks, rail, hotels and leisure, with around 200 companies in over 30 countries. Richard is married with two children and spends most of his time at his home on Necker Island.
       "Branson has a list of achievements unmatched by any other UK businessman. For anyone burning with entrepreneurial zeal, his reminiscences are akin to a sacred text" (Mail on Sunday)"Grabs you on page one and never lets go ... a rollercoaster ride ... read what makes this brilliant and hardworking man tick" (Spectator)"Candid and humorous" (Times)"An incredible man, and this is an incredible autobiography... a great read - sex, balloons, intrigue and money" (Sunday Business)"A remarkable story of business success against the financial odds - having created one of the world's most admired brand names, Branson is entitled to tell it all." (Evening Standard)
  I'm not a lover of books that are 500+ pages long so when I first received this book I was a little put off. After reading the first few pages though I was gripped and couldn't put it down. At a very early age, Branson seemed to have that drive that has stayed with him and has made him what he is. His lifestyle in the early days is not what you imagine and he has had his fair share of bad luck. The book takes you step by step through his life up until he is 40. He is a very likeable, genuine and considerate man and he seems to be into everything, literally!. If you think being dislexic might set you back, think again. I admired Branson's drive and enthusiasm before I read this book, now it's got me hooked and I want to find out more about him. A totally gripping book start to finish and this is the first book that I can honestly say that I couldn't put down. It has my recommendation and if I had the chance of working with him I'd jump at it !  Brilliant - well worth a buy.
  Trust me, this book is highly informative and very interesting. Branson is a determined and corageous man who believed in something and achieved it.  He worked hard for success and his background had nothing to do with it. I certainly don't remember a part in the book which refers to him getting anything on a plate.The disgraceful behaviour of British Airways towards Vigin Air is riveting reading. I bet most readers would question whether they would fly BA again!
  I'm a bit of a junky when it comes to biographies, especially ones concerning business or politics. This book did not disappoint. For a Virgin virgin this book is a really interesting insight into the creation of the Branson Empire.My only negative is that the last quarter really bored me. The business bit is so much more intersting than hearing about how he's trying to save the world, cure disease and stop global warming. Less candid and more dreamy.All in all though very happy to recommend what has been a really good read on the whole.
  This book catalogues a series of truly impressive achievements, but does so in a very down to earth way.  At no point do you feel that Branson is exaggerating his input into any of Virgin's achievements - credit is given where it's due, and blame accepted where appropriate.Through understanding what has gone on behind the scenes in Branson's life, it becomes clear that this hasn't all been an easy ride, nor has anything been handed to this man on a plate.  He and his fellow workers have built the Virgin empire through hard work, a lot of forward thinking, learning vital lessons from big mistakes, and by never being afraid that they might have to pick themselves and start over after a big fall.If you're looking for a bit of inspiration, whether you're a business-head or a regular Joe, there will be something for you here.  Branson's determination and enthusiasm in both his business and personal life are inspiring, but it's nice to know he's not completely perfect; really he's just like the rest of us, just a little more daring (and at times, one might suggest - daft?!)I look forward to reading about the next ten years!
  A very enjoyable read, charting the highs and lows of Richard Branson's business and personal life from his beginnings at Student magazine to the hugely successful Virgin Group of today.Those expecting his philosophy on successful entrepreneurship to be covered in detail may be disappointed, however it still makes very interesting reading - leaving the reader with a good understanding of his business style and his true passions in life.One of the better autobiographies!
  I work for an airline and so could see what Richard Branson was saying later on in the book. This man is a genius. This book could almost be a medical book for anyone going out into business or already in business. After reading this book I was left totally inspired.
  Richard Branson is founder and chairman of the Virgin Group, which is probably one of the world's most diversified companies. It has businesses ranging from music records and mobile phones through to balloon-flying and bridal services. This book is split up into 28 short chapters and a epilogue.The book starts initially with Branson's failed around-the-world-ballooning attempt in Morocco in January 1997, before starting at his childhood. Richard Branson was born in the South of England in 1950, which is where he grew most of his childhood. "My childhood is something of a blur to me now, but there are several episodes that stand out. I remember that my parents continually set challenges for us." During his time at a big public secondary school started thinking up schemes to make money. These schemes ranged from growing Christmas trees and breeding budgies; most of them leading nowhere. Eventually, his schoolfriend Jonny and Richard wanted to set up an alternative magazine aimed at students. "The first issue of 'Student' was published in January 1968." This led to them setting up a music shop, leading to a record label, and eventually leading to one of the largest privately-owned companies in the world. Each of the different events is discussed in detail, while written in an novel-type style.I normally do not read autobiographies, since I think most of them are "ego-trips". Not this one however, I was surprised how honest Richard Branson was about his not always successful private life and business ventures. Since this book was first published in 1998, the life of Richard Branson has not been standing still. Therefore, be prepared for Volume II of the Sir Richard Branson-story. And I must admit that I cannot wait.
  For some reason I decided to read this book even though I had a guttural dislike to RB.  However, I am now a convert!  This is a long book but I read it in a day. Read more
  I read this recently for the second time (realising as I do so that my original paperback didn't have the more recent chapters). Read more
  An interesting insight into the life, chances, luck and hard work of an inspiration.....like him or loath him you have to admire his spirit and achievement!
  A great read - occasionally  lavatorial  . But the book gives a great insight into the evolving of Virgin  I would love to meet him!!
  I loved this book, Richard Branson is an incredible success and his story is inspirational. Would recommend this book to everyone
  Autobiographies are tricky to assess. Take 'It's Not About The Bike' for instance, which could be retrospectively retitled 'It All About The Doping. Read more
  This is brilliant. Buy it and you won't be disappointed. I read this many many years ago and it really is a joy to read. Branson is a genius.
  Amazing author, clever and brave. Finally understand why it is so much different to fly with Virgin.I love it. m
  The life story of Richard Branson - and a strong amount of lessons that any entreprenuer can learn to follow in their own lives!

Virgin is one of the world’s most irresistible brands and has expanded into many diverse sectors from travel to telecommunications, health to banking and music to leisure. There are now more than 100 Virgin companies worldwide, employing approximately 60,000 people in over 50 countries.    Having started Virgin as a mail order record retailer in 1970, Branson founded Virgin Records and opened a record shop on Oxford Street, London. After building a recording studio, The Manor, the first Virgin artist, Mike Oldfield, recorded and released ‘Tubular Bells’. Virgin Records went on to sign household names from the Sex Pistols to The Rolling Stones, becoming the biggest independent label in the world.
Since Branson founded Virgin Atlantic in 1984, it has established itself as a leading global airline after overcoming BA’s Dirty Tricks campaign. Virgin Australia, Virgin America, Virgin Holidays, Virgin Limited Edition, Virgin Trains, Virgin Hotels and Virgin Galactic have followed in travel, while expansion elsewhere has seen Branson become the only person to build eight billion dollar companies in eight different sectors.
Branson has challenged himself with many record breaking adventures, including the fastest ever Atlantic Ocean crossing, a series of hot air balloon adventures and kitesurfing across the English Channel. He has described Virgin Galactic, the world’s first commercial spaceline, as being “the greatest adventure of all”. Space travel has been a dream for Branson since he watched the moon landings on TV, and he registered the Virgin Galactic name in 1999. Testing for commercial service is underway, with Branson planning to join his family on the first space flight. He is also a record breaker online, voted the UK’s number one Twitter user, the world’s most social CEO and the world’s most followed person on LinkedIn. Branson maintains a daily blog on http://virgin.com discussing everything from entrepreneurship, conservation and sustainability to travel, music and humour. He has more than 11.5 million followers across five social networks. He has also written six books, including autobiography Losing My Virginity.
Since starting youth culture magazine Student aged, Branson has found entrepreneurial ways to provoke positive change in the world. He started a Student Advisory Centre aged 17 to help young people overcome issues ranging from abortion to sexuality. He set up the Virgin Earth Challenge in 2007 - a $25 million prize for scalable and sustainable ways of removing greenhouse gases from the air. 
In 2004 he established non-profit foundation Virgin Unite to tackle tough social and environmental problems and strives to make business a force for good. Most of his time is now spent working with Virgin Unite and organisations it has incubated, such as The Elders, Carbon War Room, B Team and Branson Centre of Entrepreneurship. He also serves on the Global Commission on Drug Policy and supports ocean conservation with the OceanElders. Branson was awarded a knighthood in 1999 for services to entrepreneurship.  He lives on Necker Island with his wife Joan, and has two children, Holly and Sam.

=======================================================
Richard Branson is an entrepreneur and businessman, who founded the Virgin group of more than 400 companies. The Virgin group grew  from a small record shop he founded in 1972, to become a major multinational company including interests in transport, media, and entertainment. Richard Branson is also a flamboyant character and has taken part in a number of gruelling adventure challenges, such as sailing across the Atlantic and taking part in round the world hot air balloon journeys.
My general attitude to life is to enjoy every minute of every day. I  never do anything with a feeling of, “Oh God, I've got to do this  today.” 
Richard Branson was born in Blackheath, London 18 July 1950. His father was a barrister. Branson attended Scaitcliffe School and later Stowe school. Suffering from dyslexia, Branson did not excel at studies; he was more interested in extra curricular activities, such as football and cricket. At the age of 15, he had started to try his first business ventures, which included trying to grow trees and another raising budgerigars.
On one occasion, he was caught leaving the bedroom of the headmaster's daughter, and Branson was expelled from school. This left him devastated and he wrote a suicide note, suggesting he couldn't cope. When the note was discovered, he was forgiven, but failing at his studies, Branson left school at 16 - an early high school drop out.
After quitting school, he moved back to London, where he began his first successful business. He started a magazine about youth culture, called The Student. It was produced by students, for students and was launched in 1966. Branson was able to attract significant advertisement from firms wishing to tap the student market; this enabled him to distribute the first 50,000 copies for free.
The 1960s in London, was known as the 'swinging sixties' And Branson admits he was living the life of a hippy, in a London commune - a large shared house, surrounded by the music and drugs of the age. However, although he may have been a hippie, Branson also had a keen business sense, and he set up a mail order record company, called Virgin to complement the student magazine. Virgin was suggested by one of Branson's workers - who suggested the name because they were all new at business. Branson later said he got into business out of accident - not to make money, but out of frustration things weren't better.
I became an entrepreneur by mistake. Ever since then I've gone into  business, not to make money, but because I think I can do it better than  it's been done elsewhere. And, quite often, just out of personal  frustration about the way it's been done by other people. (interview with Martyn Lewis in his book, Reflections on Success (1997)
With modest profits from his magazine and mail order business, he was able to get a record shop on Oxford Street, London. Undercutting other High Street retailers, Virgin experienced good growth. Though, on one occasion, due to an unpaid tax bill, Branson's mother Eve had to re-mortgage her house to help Branson stay afloat.
As the record business expanded, Branson created his own record label, with Nik Powell - Virgin Music in 1972. Within a year, Branson had a great stroke of luck. His first artist, Mike Oldfield,  recorded the album 'Tubular Bells'  and this proved a smash hit, staying in the charts for over four years. This high profile and earnings, helped Branson to sign up some of the top bands of the era, including Culture Club, the Rolling Stones, Genesis, and controversial bands such as the Sex Pistols.
In 1984, Branson branched out into his biggest business venture - forming Virgin Atlantic Airways, and started competing in a market dominated by big national carriers, such as British Airways. At times this rivalry was intense, with Virgin accusing British Airways of dirty tricks in poaching customers. British Airways eventually settled out of court. However, in 1992, Branson had to sell Virgin records to EMI for £500m to help keep a struggling Virgin Atlantic afloat.
Other big business ventures of the Virgin group include Virgin Mobile in 1999 and entering into British railways with Virgin Trains in 1993. In 2007, he created Virgin Money. Less successful ventures include Virgin cola, and Virgin vodka. He also failed to win a contract to run the National Lottery - even though he offered to do it not for profit.
My philosophy is that if I have any money I invest it in new ventures and not have it sitting around. (Interview, Sunday Times, 16th January, 2000
Richard Branson has sought to cultivate a different approach to running a business. He says the ethos of his businesses is to build from the bottom up - taking into account the feedback from all staff, and not just top down hierarchy.
'As much as you need a strong personality to build a business from  scratch, you also must understand the art of delegation. I have to be  good at helping people run the individual businesses, and I have to be  willing to step back. The company must be set up so it can continue  without me.' (Virgin Quotes)
He has also been willing to take risks, setting up unconventional business plans. In his autobiography, he also says that having fun, is an important element of his approach to life and business:
“Fun is at the core of the way I like to do business and it has been key  to everything I've done from the outset. More than any other element,  fun is the secret of Virgin's success. I am aware that the ideas of  business as being fun and creative goes right against the grain of  convention, and it's certainly not how the they teach it at some of  those business schools, where business means hard grind and lots of  'discounted cash flows' and net' present values'.” 
 Richard Branson,  Losing My Virginity: How I've Survived, Had Fun, and Made a Fortune Doing Business My Way
Branson states that after meeting Al Gore, he became concerned about the issue of global warming. He has founded Virgin fuels to promote alternative to fossil files. He has also promised to use profits from his transport business to develop more environmentally friendly fuels. In 2007, he set up the Virgin Earth Challenge which offers a reward of $25 million to the best commercially viable design for removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, without negative effects.
Richard Branson has undertook many endurance world record attempts. He set the fastest transatlantic sailing record in 1986. He also made several record attempts in hot air balloons. In 1998, he failed in a bid to make a global flight in a hot air balloon.
With Nelson Mandela and Peter Gabriel, Branson formed a new group 'The Elders', which seeks to find peaceful resolutions to long standing conflicts and global problems. Other members included Desmond Tutu, Kofi Annan, Jimmy Carter and Mohammed Yunus. Branson is also involved in a variety of other charities, such as education in Kenya, Soldiers for Peace and has served on the global commission on drug policy.
The Sunday Times estimate the wealth of Richard Branson at £3,065 billion, making him the fourth richest person in the UK. Much of this is invested in off-shore havens.

Sir Richard Branson, the owner of Virgin group, started his life as an entrepreneur at very early age of 16. He made his fortune very quickly and made his first million by the age of 25. But all this didn't came on a silver platter for him, he was born into a typical English middle-class family who had to be cost-conscious.
His father was a struggling barrister and was not quite earning enough to match outgoings, so his mother was always finding things to make or sell to pay for holidays. They would turn off the light bulbs when the children went to bed and even today, ""struggling through dark corridors to find the loo"" is a vivid childhood memory for Richard. He drives a Range Rover, and even that is given to him each year as thanks for some nice things he said about the brand after surviving an accident in one. It's rather a irony that Branson is known for his lifestyle despite his frugal approach.
He attributes it to fact that its because all his expenditures are actually investments and instead of costing him maintenance they rather earns for him. Virtually every property that he owns is available for lease or rent including his beloved Necker Island. Virgin chief is aiming to take his oft-seen face to space. Recently debuted the Virgin SpaceShipTwo, which he believes will revolutionize commercial space travel. After selling a 32% stake in the venture to Abu Dhabi fund Aabar Investments, Sir Branson plans to test prototype flights this year and launch tourists trips as early as 2012. Cost for a ticket would be $200,000.
"Ridiculous yachts and private planes and big limousines won't make people enjoy life more, and it sends out terrible messages to the people who work for them. It would be so much better if that money was spent in Africa - and it's about getting a balance."
"I never get the accountants in before I start up a business. It's done on gut feeling, especially if I can see that they are taking the mickey out of the consumer."
"I was dyslexic, I had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever. I certainly would have failed IQ tests. And it was one of the reasons I left school when I was 15 years old. And if I - if I'm not interested in something, I don't grasp it."
""For me business is not about wearing suits,or keeping stockholders pleased.It's about being true to yourself,your ideas and focusing on the essentials"."
""I certainly tip larger if I feel that people have done their work with a smile. But I don't splash out because I think that's embarrassing.""
"“With the casino and the beds, our passengers will have at least two ways to get lucky on one of our flights.”"
"My mother was determined to make us independent. When I was four years old, she stopped the car a few miles from our house and made me find my own way home across the fields. I got hopelessly lost."
"So I've seen life as one long learning process. And if I see - you know, if I fly on somebody else's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't in - 21 years ago, then I'd think, well, you know, maybe I can create the kind of airline that I'd like to fly on."
"“I wanted to be an editor or a journalist, I wasn't really interested in being an entrepreneur, but I soon found I had to become an entrepreneur in order to keep my magazine going.”"
"“We're introducing separate rooms with double beds in all of our planes so people can actually go with their partner and have a proper night's sleep.”"
In the early days Richard Branson used to take records round Dover docks in a scam designed to avoid sales tax. He was eventually caught by customs, spent the night in prison and paid £53,000 as part of an out-of-court settlement to avoid a criminal record.
He was Voted as the world's worst-dressed man, he doesn't spend much on clothes, he just puts his hand in the cupboard to "grab whatever he've got."
Richard Branson still puts a few thousand pounds away every month in a tracker fund investing in the top 800 shares.
Richard Branson the star of a reality television show on Fox called The Rebel Billionaire: Branson's Quest for the Best (2004), in which sixteen contestants were tested for their entrepreneurship and sense of adventure.
Sir Richard Branson has a dubious distinction of being covered in both the "100 Greatest Britons" and "100 Worst Britons" lists by BBC Channel 4.
Sir Richard Branson became the first person to cross Atlantic in a hot air balloon, and also to fly in largest Balloon "Virgin Atlantic Challenger II".
In 1991 Branson broke the record for fastest voyage through pacific on a balloon from Japan to Arctic Canada.
In March 2004, Branson set a record by travelling from Dover to Calais in a Gibbs Aquada in 1 hour, 40 minutes and 6 seconds, the fastest crossing of the English Channel in an amphibious vehicle.

What really distinguishes Branson’s yacht from other celebrity yachts is that it is one of the very few luxury catamarans in the world. Originally launched as the Lady Barbaretta in 2003, Necker Belle spent two years being refitted at Australia’s Azzura Marine. The speedy yacht’s 14-metre beam encompasses four en suite staterooms all above the waterline providing great views. The interiors are very similar to Branson’s Necker island retreat and include four en suite staterooms and the main cabin’s lounge area, which can be converted to a double cabin.
The catamaran can accommodate up to 10 guests in as well as a crew of seven. At 20 knots while under sail and 18 knots under power, the yacht provides a speedy cruising experience. Branson has put out the yacht at charter, prices starting from $88,000 a week.  
If anyone wants to partake in the luxury of one of the most celebrated island resorts of the world, Necker Island is the place for them. Multipreneur and Virgin boss, Richard Branson bought it for a paltry 180,000 pounds back in 1978. It took him 3 years and a capital of $10 million to turn the previously uninhabited island into a haven for luxury scavengers and privacy fanatics. Branson reportedly spends at least two of the summer months there. Necker Island's guest list boasts many high profile names. The late Princess Diana vacationed there with the young Princes William and Harry. Oprah Winfrey, Kevin Costner, Geena Davis, Robert De Niro, Kate Moss, Nick Lachey, Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr have all landed up on the island's pristine beaches. Victoria's Secret descended on the island to shoot its 2010 swimsuit catalog.   Good friend and tech-entrepreneur Larry Page chose Necker Island as his wedding venue.
Location: A part of British Virgin islands, Necker Island is located a little north to the Virgin Gorda, one of the bigger islands out there. It’s Caribbean ambience means that the 74 acres of land is well supported by lush greenery, magnificent beaches and beautiful turquoise water.  
Accommodation: Branson has made good use of the local resources to make his, what he famously calls “The Great House”, a 10 bedroom Balinese style villa crowning a hill above the beach. The majestic dwelling features 10 guest rooms, each having its own terrace views overlooking the neighboring island and ocean. A second floor Jacuzzi and a master terrace with mesmerizing sun views make the house a complete heaven for nature enthusiasts. The airy and spacious dining area offers nice ambience while performing the essential activities of life. The kitchen overflows with sumptuous smell of ingredients flown in daily from Miami to create mouthwatering meals that could easily grace a Michelin-starred restaurant’s menu.  Along with the main house are three additional Balinese houses, built in Bali, dismantled and then reassembled on Necker Island, providing three other guest accommodations. 
Features: Other than the grandiose living arrangements there is a lot that adds value to your stay at the Necker Island. One can either stroll at its white sandy beaches or engage in various recreational activities like sailing, water skiing, wind surfing, snorkeling, scuba diving or fishing. But the show stealer is the Necker Nymph, a one of its kind underwater aircraft specially built for Sir Richard Branson. This 3-person aero submarine takes the excitement to a whole new level.  
It is needless to say that Necker Island is not only the favorite destination of its owner but also for many, many other celebrities, who wish to go on a sabbatical or just want to experience the best. Good friend and tech-entrepreneur Larry Page was one such high profile guest who chose Necker Island as his wedding venue.
To get there by plane, the closest international airport is on Virgin Tortola (Beef Island) which is a 35-minute flight from San Juan. If one wants to take the water route, Necker is approximately 30 minutes from Tortola and 10 minutes from Virgin Gorda, or one can take a helicopter from Tortola, Virgin Gorda, St. Thomas, San Juan and many other neighboring islands.

The unbeatable experience will be inclusive of two private beaches, pools, tennis courts, spectacular views, a personal chef, a team of about 60 staff and of course, the show stopper, Necker Nymph.

Branson paid $10 million for Moskito in 2007 and is aiming to turn it into "the most ecologically friendly" island in the world. The 120 acre island is located in the North Sound just off shore from Anguilla Point, Virgin Gorda. it is one of densest rain forest of region and is famous for its Eco diversity. Branson has plan to develop this island as showcase of biodiversity and raise colony of few exotic species on that island.
He explained:"It would be far too extravagant to have it all to myself. I’m planning to have the minimum number of buildings there. Just enough for me and my family, plus room for maybe four or five other families who could also live on it. They could either be full-time residents or those who just want to have a home in the [British] Virgin Islands. I’m not sure who they’ll be yet, but the one or two people who I’ve mentioned it to have said that they would love to go there.”
Branson wants to implement the most environment friendly technologies, using carbon-neutral, Balinese-style villas, and application of ecologically sound cement. Added to that, power will be wind, wave or solar based, and there will also be a butterfly park.
Richard Branson owns the French made, long range, ultra luxe corporate jet Falcon 900EX. The exterior of the jet make it clear that Branson wants it to be a mobile advertisement of Virgin Galactic, the space travel arm of Richard Branson’s business empire. It has similar tail fin markings, the evolving VG aircraft have been stenciled near the cabin door, while the engine markings are G-GALX. The aircraft itself is named Galactic Girl. This jet has a maximum cruising altitude of 36,000 feet, speed of mach 0.87 (662 mph) and in its factory configuration can seat up to fourteen passengers. 
While humans have always thought of flying in the sky, no one took the thought as seriously as billionaire Sir Richard Branson. Branson has unveiled the 60-foot-long ship whose design is based on the original SpaceShipOne. It is the world's first commercial spacecraft and his daughter Holly Sampson has named it the VSS Enterprise, after the fictional intergalactic vessel in Star Trek.  
The new spacecraft is designed to seat eight people incuding six passengers and two pilots. The Virgin Galactic passengers will buy a $200,000 ticket for a 2.5-hour flight aboard SpaceShipTwo. The spaceship will launch from an altitude of about 60,000 feet (18,288 meters), while buckled safely in seats that recline flat after reaching suborbital space and will reach a maximum altitude of at least 68 miles. The spacesuit designs are not yet final but they will likely be equipped with personal data and image recorders to add to SpaceShipTwo's in-cabin cameras.

Not everyone has the dream of flying in the skies — some take it to the deep seas. And this is why billionaire Sir Richard Branson commissioned an underwater plane, the Necker Nymph, intended to take visitors to his luxury hideaway, Necker Island, on an underwater joy ride. The £415,000 ($663,000) luxury sub can dive to depths of up to 130ft with its fighter jet technology. Unlike other subs that use ballasts to propel subs under the water, the Nymph uses downward "lift" on the wings to glide like an airplane through the water to carry a pilot and two visitors on a two-hour trip. So, to uncover ancient shipwrecks or fly side by side with dolphins or follow whales, the Nymph is available to hire for $25,000 a week (£15,000), but only if you are on board Branson's luxury catamaran, the Necker Belle, after shelling out a minimum of $88,000 (£55,000).
Richard Branson wrote in his blog about how kitesurfing has now become his favorite sport. He spent his weekend kitesurfing on the Necker Island with Google founder Larry Page and his wife Lucy Page.
