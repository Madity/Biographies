=======================================================
Robert Peter "Robbie" Williams[1] (born 13 February 1974) is an English singer-songwriter, and occasional actor. He is a member of the pop group Take That, but has found greater commercial success as a solo artist.
Williams rose to fame in the band's first run in the early- to mid-1990s. After many disagreements with the management and group members, Williams left the group in 1995 to launch a hugely successful solo career, which saw his first seven albums each reach number one in the UK. Williams also released seven number-one singles and found similar success across Europe.[2] On 15 July 2010, it was announced he had rejoined Take That. The group's subsequent album became the second fastest-selling album in UK chart history[3] and the fastest-selling record of the century so far.[4] He continues to perform both as a member of Take That and as a solo artist.
Williams has sold more than 77 million albums and singles worldwide.[5] He is the best-selling British solo artist in the United Kingdom and the best selling non-Latino artist in Latin America. Six of his albums are among the top 100 biggest-selling albums in the United Kingdom, and in 2006 he entered the Guinness Book of World Records for selling 1.6 million tickets of his Close Encounters Tour in a single day.[6] He has also been honoured with seventeen BRIT Awards—more than any other artist—and eight ECHO Awards. In 2004, he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame after being voted as the "Greatest Artist of the 1990s." Williams is married to actress Ayda Field. He has a net worth of £130 million (2014).[7]
Williams has currently (based on BPI certifications) sold a minimum of 18.9 million albums and 5.4 million singles in the UK alone as a solo artist.[8] Williams was also topped the 2000-2010 UK airplay chart racking up almost 50% more plays than the Sugarbabesat number 2.
Williams was born in Stoke-on-Trent, on 13 February 1974. His parents, Janet (née Farrell) and Peter Williams, ran a pub called the Red Lion in the town of Burslem, before his father became the licensee at the Port Vale F.C. Social Club – this led to Williams' lifelong affinity for the team.[9] His maternal grandfather was Irish, from Kilkenny.[10]
Williams attended Mill Hill Primary School in Stoke-on-Trent[11] then St Margaret Ward Roman Catholic School in Tunstall,[12] and also attended dance school UKDDF in Tunstall. He participated in several school plays, and his biggest role was that of the Artful Dodger in a production of Oliver!.
In 1990, the sixteen-year-old Williams was the youngest member to join Take That. According to the documentary Take That: For the Record, his mother read an advertisement seeking members for a new boy band and suggested that he try out for the group. He met fellow member Mark Owen on the day of his audition/interview with Nigel Martin-Smith. During the heights of the band's popularity, Williams was known as the extrovert and practical joker of the band. Although the majority of the band's material was written and performed by Gary Barlow, Williams did perform lead vocals on their first Top Ten hit "Could It Be Magic", "I Found Heaven", and "Everything Changes". However, he had conflicts with Martin-Smith over the restrictive rules for Take That members, and he began drinking more alcohol and dabbling in cocaine.
In July 1995, Williams's drug abuse had escalated to the point of his having a near drug overdose the night before the group was scheduled to perform at the MTV Europe Music Awards.[13] According to the documentary For the Record, he stated that he was unhappy with his musical ideas not being taken seriously by lead singer Barlow and Nigel Martin-Smith, because his desire to explore hip hop and rap conflicted with the band's usual ballads. Barlow explained in interviews that Williams had given up trying to offer creative input and merely did as he was told. As well as Williams's friction with the management of the band, Jason Orange had problems with his increasingly belligerent behaviour, his lack of interest in performing, and his frequent habit of missing the band's rehearsals.
Both Orange and Barlow confronted Martin-Smith about the internal conflict, because they did not want him dropping out while touring and before any possible future touring of America, which never took place. During one of the last rehearsals before the tour commenced, the group confronted Williams about his attitude and stated they wanted to do the tour without him. He agreed to quit the band and left; it would be the last time for twelve years that they were all together. Despite the departure of Williams, Take That completed their Nobody Else Tour as a four-piece band. They later disbanded on 13 February 1996, Williams's 22nd birthday.
Shortly afterwards, Williams was photographed by the press partying with the members of Oasis at Glastonbury Festival. Following his departure, he became the subject of talk shows and newspapers as he acknowledged his plans to become a solo singer, and he was spotted partying with George Michael in France. However, a clause in his Take That contract prohibited him from releasing any material until after the group was officially dissolved, and he was later sued by Martin-Smith and forced to pay $200,000 in commission. After various legal battles over his right to a solo career, Williams was victorious in getting released from his contract with BMG. On 27 June 1996, Williams formally announced that he had signed with Chrysalis Records.
On 27 March 2009, Williams stated he felt ready to re-join Take That. He said: "I'm in regular contact with them, even Gaz, and it's looking more likely by the week. The lads all seem up for it and some people think it's a done deal. I think it would be fun."[14] Williams was eager to re-join the band on their The Circus Live tour, but these plans never materialised. In September 2009, Williams was reported to be working in New York with Take That, however these rumours were never confirmed.[15]
While it was rumoured that Williams would reunite with Take That on 12 November 2009 for a Children In Need charity concert at The Royal Albert Hall, they merely greeted each other warmly on stage between performances. However, both did join with the other acts in the final song of the evening, with Williams putting his arm around Gary Barlow and singing "Hey Jude".
It was announced on 15 July that Williams had rejoined Take That. In November 2010 the Take That album Progress was released, becoming the fastest selling album since 2000 and the second fastest selling album in UK history. Williams explained that the long-standing friction between himself and Gary has been resolved, and how close they now were.[16]
The band also announced the Progress Live tour which would travel across the UK, including a record breaking 8 nights at Wembley Stadium in London,[17] then continue across Europe. The tour was the fastest selling in UK history with ticket hotlines and websites crashing under the demand.[17]
In August 2012, Take That performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics. Williams was due to perform with the band but dropped out due to his wife giving birth at around the same time and thus the group performed as a four-piece.[18] In May 2013, Owen announced that Take That will begin recording their 7th studio album in 2014.
After leaving Take That, Williams launched his solo career starting off in 1996 by covering George Michael's "Freedom", the single reached number two in the UK Singles Chart.[19]
Recordings for Williams's first album began at London's Maison Rouge studios in March 1996. Shortly after his introduction to Guy Chambers, Williams released "Old Before I Die" which would be the first single taken from his debut album. The single reached number two on the UK Charts;[19] however, it was largely ignored on international charts.
His debut album, Life Thru a Lens, was released in September 1997. The album launched with his first live solo gig at the Élysée Montmartre theatre in Paris, France. The album debuted at number eleven of the UK Album Charts.
Williams released what would be the fourth single taken from his album. "Angels" became Williams' best-seller in the United Kingdom.[20] The song, apart from becoming a hit around Europe and Latin America, caused sales of his album to skyrocket. The album remained inside the British top ten for forty weeks and spent 218 weeks there altogether, making it the 58th best selling album in UK history with sales of over 2.4 million.[21] The album eventually managed to sell over three million copies in Europe.[22]
Williams and Chambers started writing the second album in Jamaica in early 1998. The first single, "Millennium", became Williams' first solo number one single in the United Kingdom.[23] It also became a top twenty hit in many European countries, Latin America and Australia.[24]
When the album I've Been Expecting You was released in late October 1998, it debuted at number one in the UK Albums Chart.[23] The album received more attention outside the United Kingdom, leaving its mark in the European and Latin American markets with hits such as "No Regrets", a collaboration with The Pet Shop Boys' singer Neil Tennant and The Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon.
A cover of a track from World Party's album, Egyptology, became Williams' second number one hit in the UK.[23] Williams finished the year with a European Tour late in 1999.
The album I've Been Expecting You sold almost 3 million copies in the UK and was certified 10x Platinum by the BPI.[25] In Europe, the album sold over 4 million copies.[26]
In 1999, Williams was signed to Capitol Records in the United States, a part of EMI. He embarked on a US promotional tour and released his first U.S. and Canadian single, "Millennium". The album The Ego Has Landed was released in July 1999 in the United States and Canada.
In the middle of promotion and the tours in 1999, Williams began work on his third studio album. This time he had finally found his inner confidence.[27]
The first single taken from the album was "Rock DJ", a song inspired by Williams's UNICEF mentor, the late Ian Dury. The video showed Williams in an attempt to get noticed by a group of females, first stripping and then tearing chunks of skin and muscle from his body, and caused controversy in the United Kingdom and many other countries. The video was edited by Top of the Pops for its graphic content and many other channels followed suit.[28] The song became an instant hit, reaching number one in the UK (becoming his third number one single as a solo artist) and New Zealand. The song went on to win "Best Song of 2000" at the MTV Europe Music Awards, "Best Single of the Year" at the BRIT Awards and an MTV Video Music Award for Best Special Effects.
When the album, Sing When You're Winning was released in August 2000, it topped the charts in many different countries.[29] In the UK the album was certified 2x Platinum on its first week of release.[30]
After the success of his third album, Williams wanted to take another musical direction. He took two weeks off from his tour to record what would be his fourth studio album, a big band album.[31] Born from his lifelong love for Frank Sinatra – combined with the success of the track "Have You Met Miss Jones?" that he recorded for the film Bridget Jones' Diary in early 2001 – the album was recorded at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles.
Williams took the chance to duet with his long-time friend Jonathan Wilkes, Little Voice star Jane Horrocks, Saturday Night Live star Jon Lovitz, Rupert Everett and actress Nicole Kidman. The first single released from the album was a duet with Kidman, on "Somethin' Stupid". Originally a hit for Frank and Nancy Sinatra, the song became Williams' fifth number one hit in the UK.[32] It eventually went on to become one of the biggest hits of 2001.[33]
When the album Swing When You're Winning (in reference to his 2000 studio album Sing When You're Winning) was released in late 2001, it became an instant hit in the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Austria, Germany and Switzerland.[34]
"Beyond the Sea" was featured over the credits of the film Finding Nemo in 2003 and was also released on the film's soundtrack CD.
A DVD called Robbie Williams Live at the Albert Hall was released in December of that year. So far, it has become one of the best selling music DVDs in Europe, being certified 6x Platinum in the United Kingdom[35] and 2x Platinum in Germany.[36]
In 2002, Williams signed a record-breaking £80 million contract with EMI.[37] The contract included a number of provisos, including the label ceding greater creative control to the artist and a commitment to breaking Williams into the US market. So far it is the biggest music deal in British history. The deal was brokered by Ingenious Media, a leading UK corporate finance advisory business.[38]
Williams began working on what would be his fifth studio album, spending a year in the recording studio. The album heralded a new era for Williams. He had taken a more active role in the making of this album, giving an indication of his growing confidence in the studio. "One Fine Day", "Nan's Song", and "Come Undone" were the first songs that Williams wrote without the input of Guy Chambers. Most of the songs were recorded in Los Angeles.[38]
The album's first single, "Feel", written by Williams and Chambers, was recorded as a demo. When they started working on the album and were trying to re-record the vocals, Williams felt unsatisfied with it, so he decided to include the demo version and then release it as the first single.[39] When the single was released in late 2002, it became Williams' biggest international hit, going number one in countries like The Netherlands and Italy, as well as reaching the top ten in almost every single European country.[40]
When Williams' fifth studio album, Escapology, was released in late 2002, it hit number one in at least 10 countries around the world. In the United States, however, it failed to make such an impact. Escapology sold almost 2 million copies by the end of 2003 in the United Kingdom.[41]
In October 2004, Williams released, Greatest Hits, a retrospective of his career, and also, to reveal the new tracks he had been working on with the then-new collaborator, Stephen Duffy.[42] "Radio", the compilation's first single, debuted at number one in the UK Singles Chart[23] (becoming Williams' sixth number-one hit). When the compilation was later released it debuted at number one in the UK[23] and was the best selling album of the year in the UK[43] and Europe.[44]
Eight years after the release of "Angels", in February 2005 the British public voted it as the "Best Single of the Past Twenty-Five Years" at the 2005 BRIT Awards.[45]
After touring Latin America in late 2004 for the promotion Greatest Hits, Williams started working on his sixth studio album. Recorded at his house in the Hollywood Hills, the album was co-written by Stephen Duffy over the course of 24 months.[46] The album Intensive Care was launched in Berlin on 9 October. It became a smash hit around the world.
In November 2005, Williams took home the MTV Europe Music Award for 'Best Male', but also, entered in The Guinness Book of World Records when he announced his World Tour for 2006, selling 1.6 million tickets in one single day.[47] But after the success, Gary Barlow, Mark Owen, Jason Orange, and Howard Donald had agreed to reunite in Notting Hill, west London, for a preview screening of a documentary about Take That. The documentary screened on ITV1 on 16 November 2005. Unfortunately, according to a source quoted by The Sunday Mirror, "Robbie announced he wasn't coming. The rest of the band were gutted but felt the show had to go on."[48]
Williams kicked off his Close Encounters World Tour in South Africa in April 2006, when he finished his European leg of the tour. 2.5 million people had seen the show,[49] and after touring Latin America and Australia the numbers went up to 3 million.
Williams released his much anticipated dance/electro album, Rudebox, on 23 October 2006. It featured collaborations with the Pet Shop Boys, William Orbit, Soul Mekanik, Joey Negro, Mark Ronson, Chris Grierson, and The Orr Boys. It received mixed reviews: Allmusic gave it a four star rating, the NME 8 out of 10, and Music Week and MOJO were equally positive,[50] but it received much weaker reviews from some of the British press. The album sold 2x Platinum in Europe with sales of over 2 million making it the fastest platinum-selling album of 2006.[51] The album finished at number eighteen in the list of 2006's best selling albums worldwide. Neil Tennant claimed the album had sold 4.5 million copies by early 2007.[52] To promote his album, Williams commissioned a series of short films.[53] Goodbye to the Normals was directed by Jim Field Smith and features "Burslem Normals" by Robbie Williams.
The first single, "Rudebox", was premiered on radio by Scott Mills on his show on BBC Radio 1. The event caused some controversy, as the record label's embargo date was broken, although Williams himself later backed the presenter for doing so. More controversy followed due to the first single's radical change of direction when compared to his older releases. British newspaper The Sun named the song "The Worst Song Ever".[54] However, Victoria Newton stated that there were sure-fire hits on the album.[55]
Rumours of a new studio album co-written with Guy Chambers surfaced in early 2007, along with known commitments required by Williams to his EMI contract. British singer-songwriter Laura Critchley commented that she had sung vocals for three songs, and said that it would not be released until 2009.[56]
In February 2009, it was confirmed that Williams had written material with Guy Chambers and Mark Ronson. A spokesman said that Williams was planning to begin the recording sessions in March and that the new album would be released in late 2009. This will probably be the last Williams album released by EMI.[57] On his official website, Williams confirmed that he was working with producer Trevor Horn on his new album, which would eventually be titled Reality Killed the Video Star,[58] a reference to the song "Video Killed the Radio Star" by Horn's former band The Buggles. The album was released on 9 November 2009 in the United Kingdom.[59]
On 11 October 2009 Williams published a 12-track compilation album, titled Songbook, as a free CD for the newspaper The Mail on Sunday. The CD is a one-off album of some of his biggest hits – including several rare live performances.[60] That same evening, Williams made his "comeback" on The X Factor results show, performing his new single "Bodies" for the first time live.[61]
On 20 October 2009 Williams opened the BBC Electric Proms at the London RoundHouse.[62] It was his first live concert for 3 years[63] and was broadcast across 200 cinemas worldwide.[64] Accompanied by a string section, horn section, full band and producer Trevor Horn, Williams performed several new tracks from Reality Killed the Video Star and older tracks.
Reality Killed the Video Star was previewed in the UK on the Spotify music streaming service on 6 November 2009, and official released on 9 November.[65] In a high profile chart battle, Williams' album was pitted against X Factor 2008 runners-up JLS who released their debut album the same day. JLS beat Williams to the number one spot by 1500 sales. The album was also released in the United States (Williams' first album to be released there since 2002's Escapology).
In October 2010, Williams released his second greatest hits album, In and Out of Consciousness: The Greatest Hits 1990–2010, to celebrate 20 years as a performing artist.[66] A single, "Shame", was also released, which was written and sung by Williams and Barlow.[66]
On 21 October 2011 Williams announced that he had signed with Universal Music, following his departure from his previous record label EMI in 2010. He said in a statement, "I'm really thrilled to be joining the Universal family at what I think is the most exciting time in my career."[67]
Williams was the opening act at the Diamond Jubilee concert held outside Buckingham Palace on 4 June 2012. During the end of August his official website began a countdown to the release of information regarding his latest solo material, with an image of his face and his mind unveiled daily as the countdown expired.[68] The album was then leaked on the Tesco website[clarify] in late August revealing the tracklisting and the name, Take the Crown.[69] Take the Crown debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart making it Williams' tenth number one album. It also marked the second time that Williams had a number one single ("Candy") and album at the same time on the chart. The first time was in 2001 when "Somethin' Stupid" and Swing When You're Winning were number one on the singles and albums chart respectively.[70]
The album's lead single, "Candy", premiered on 10 September 2012 and was released on 11 September in most countries and 29 October in the UK.[71] In the UK, "Candy" became Williams' first number one single since "Radio" (2004) and his seventh solo number one single. In its first week the song has sold 137,000 copies becoming the fastest-selling male artist single of the year.[72]
On 26 November 2012 Williams announced a 17 date stadium tour of Europe.[73][74] Williams also confirmed that the support act for the tour would be Olly Murs who also duets with him on "Kids".
Universal and EMI merged in 2012, bringing Williams' Chrysalis/Virgin recordings full circle to Universal.
In September 2013, Williams announced a follow up to his 2001 swing album, titled Swings Both Ways for release in November. The album features covers and original songs, whilst also including duet recordings with Michael Bublé, Olly Murs, Rufus Wainright, Lily Allen and Kelly Clarkson.[75] In November 2013 Williams made a cameo appearance in the video to Murs's song "Hand on Heart".
One of his most famous collaborations was on the song "Kids", a duet with Australian pop star Kylie Minogue. The single peaked at number 2 on the UK singles charts in 2000. Williams also collaborated with Australian film star Nicole Kidman on a cover of Frank and Nancy Sinatra's "Somethin' Stupid". The single reached number 1 on the UK singles chart in 2001. His single "No Regrets" featured Neil Tennant, and Neil Hannon on backing vocals.
In 2002, Williams appeared on the track "My Culture" on the 1 Giant Leap album, alongside rapper Maxi Jazz (which features lyrics from the hidden track "Hello Sir" from Life Thru a Lens). Williams also features on a double CD titled Concrete which was released on the same day as Rudebox. The CD features a concert recorded for the BBC featuring the Pet Shop Boys and Williams singing their classic hit "Jealousy". Their joint effort, "She's Madonna", was released as a single in March 2007. On 13 August 2007, a Dean Martin duets album was released, on which Williams sings "Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone".
In 2010 he announced that he was to release "Shame", a duet with Take That lead singer songwriter Gary Barlow as the first single from his greatest hits collection In and Out of Consciousness: The Greatest Hits 1990–2010 which was certified silver in the UK and charted in 19 countries worldwide. In 2012, Williams recorded a duet with Mexican recording artist Thalía for the Spanish song "Te quiero dijiste (Muñequita linda)", included in her album Habítame siempre.
On 26 August 2010, it was announced Williams would become a guest vocal coach on the ninth series of German reality television show Popstars: Girls forever to teach candidates for a girl group.[76]

Williams launched a radio show titled Radio Rudebox on 6 October 2011 where he played music and interviewed Gary Barlow.[78]
Williams features in his own karaoke video game, We Sing Robbie Williams which was released on 12 November 2010 by Nordic Games.
It has been claimed that Williams has sold more albums in the UK than any other British solo artist in history and has won more BRIT Awards than any other artist to date.[79] His album sales stands at over 57 million worldwide.[80][81][82] Williams was entered in The Guinness Book of World Records when, after he announced his World Tour for 2006, 1.6 million tickets were sold in one day.[83]
He has been presented many awards, including seventeen BRIT[84] and eight ECHO awards.[85] In 2004, he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame, after being voted as the Greatest artist of the 1990s.[86]
Williams appears in the list of the all-time Top 100 biggest selling albums in the United Kingdom six times.[43]
In October 2009, it was announced that he would receive the Outstanding Contribution To British Music award at the 2010 BRIT Awards.[87]
In September 2010, Williams switched on the Blackpool illuminations, stating that it was one of the greatest honours he had achieved.[88]
In October, Media Control named Williams the most successful album-artist of the millennium due to the fact that he had spent No. 1 on the German Albums Chart for 38 weeks since 2000. He also reached that chart's Top Ten 135 times.[89]
Since 2006, Williams has spent most of his time in Los Angeles, California.[90] Williams moved back to the UK in 2009 when he bought an £8.5 million mansion in Compton Bassett, Wiltshire, nearby to close friend Jonathan Wilkes who lives in Swindon. Williams sold the mansion a year later to move back to Los Angeles.[citation needed]
Williams has reportedly battled mental illness, obesity, self-esteem issues, alcoholism, and substance abuse throughout his life.[91][92] He has discussed how his friend Elton John booked him into a clinic to cope with his drug use that emerged from the depression he was experiencing while still in Take That.[92] He entered a rehabilitation centre in Tucson for his addiction to the prescription pills Xanax, Seroxat/Paxil, Vicodin, and the energy drink Lucozade in February 2007[93] In 2006, he appeared in the documentary Stephen Fry: The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive as someone who has battled with the illness for most of his life.
He revealed in 2011 he had been battling a lethargy caused by a type of hormone imbalance called andropause for a number of years and thought at first it was a return of his depression.[94][95]
Williams has a strong interest in UFOs and related paranormal phenomena, and has pursued this interest during his 2007–08 sabbatical.[96] His interest in the subject led to him taking part in a documentary for BBC Radio 4 with Jon Ronson. The documentary followed them to a UFO convention in Nevada during which Williams connected his interest in the paranormal with the desire to understand his childhood fears of his mothers interest in "the world's mysteries, elves, demons, witchcraft".[97] During an interview with Joss Stone on The Jeremy Kyle Show in 2008, Williams revealed that he has seen UFOs three times.[98] Williams said his first UFO sighting was when he was a child in Britain while he spotted his second in Beverly Hills, and added that the third sighting was just after he had written a song about alien contact.[98]
Since May 2006, Williams has been in a relationship with the Turkish American actress Ayda Field.[99] Despite several break up stories in the press,[100][101][102] Williams and Field have been spotted together many times.[103][104][105] On 29 January 2008 they were pictured on vacation together at Mammoth Ski Resort in California, accompanied by Max Beesley.[106][107][108] She was featured in a UFO documentary that Williams did for BBC Radio 4 in April[109] and took part in a field investigation he did in Trout Lake, Washington in August 2008.[110] There has been speculation for many years about Williams sexuality, with many speculating that he may be bisexual.[111][112] In an interview with Daily Star, he stated: "I love musical theatre and a lot of the other things that are often associated with gays. I am 49% homosexual and sometimes as far as 50% However, that would imply that I enjoy having a particular sort of fun, which I don't."[113]
On 8 November 2008, Williams was spotted with Field at football match at the Emirates Stadium home of Arsenal, where he was also seen with Gary Barlow accompanied by his two oldest children, and Williams's longtime friend Jonathan Wilkes.[114] The couple has been living together in a mansion in Wiltshire since the beginning of 2009 according to The Sun.[115] In October 2009, Field appeared in the video of Williams comeback single "Bodies". Williams has been referring to Field as his "wife" in recent interviews.[116]
In November 2009, Williams announced to Jonathan Ross that he was 'in love' with Field.[117] On 26 November 2009, Williams proposed to Ayda Field live on the Australian radio channel 2DayFM in an interview on The Kyle and Jackie O Show.[118] However, it was later revealed by Williams' manager that it was "done as a joke following suggestions it was a stunt which was set up prior to the radio show." His spokesman confirmed: 'He did say it, but he did it in a jocular manner. They are not engaged.'[119] A few days later Williams himself denied the engagement, using his official blog to say "Hey all. We are not engaged. Rob.".[120][121] On 7 August 2010, Williams and Field married at his home in Los Angeles.[122]
In May 2012, Williams revealed that he and his partner were expecting the birth of a daughter.[123] Theodora Rose was born on 18 September 2012.[124][125][126] Robbie Williams is good friends with Darts Player Phil Taylor.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Robbie Williams was born in Stoke On Trent, England on February 13th, 1974. Having played in school productions of "Oliver" and, obviously showing a flair for entertaining, Williams' mother saw an advert for auditions to be in a new boy band which he applied for and, at age 16, was a member of Take That. After the incredible success of Take That and countless number one hits, Robbie Williams departed from the band in July, 1995. He started his solo career slowly with modest sales for his debut album "Life Thru A Lens" on Chrysalis Records. Record sales exploded after the single "Angels" was released for Christmas 1997 - a beautiful ballad, written within 20 minutes, which recently got voted the second best song of all times by British voters. Since then, Robbie has released 4 more original albums: "I've Been Expecting You", containing the hit singles "Millennium", "Strong", "No Regrets" and "She's the One", the follow up "Sing When Your Winning", where he dueted with Kylie Minogue, the million seller "Escapology" and the live album "What We Did Last Summer", which was recorded in front of 375,000 people at his legendary Knebworth performances. Additionally to his original albums, Williams also released an extremely successful cover album of classic swing songs ("Swing When Your Winning"), on which he dueted with actress Nicole Kidman on the Frank Sinatra cover "Something Stupid", which charted in at Number 1 in the UK, and with digitally added Frank Sinatra himself doing a duet. In 2002, Robbie Williams signed a new contract with EMI worth £80 Million. His "Greatest Hits" album was released in 2004 and his 6th album titled "Intensive Care" was released in 2005, which attracted healthy sales and good reception. His 7th album, "Rudebox", was released in 2006 receiving mixed reviews and average sales but was still Number 1 in 14 countries. He released the single "She's Madonna" in 2007. Williams spent 2008 and 2009 writing his next album, working with producer Trevor Horn. In October, 2009, his latest single "Bodies" was released, receiving positive reviews and good sales. The much expected comeback album "Reality Killed the Video Star" was released in November, 2009.

      I'd make a better U.S. President than George W. Bush. Bush is an idiot. I'm a better public speaker than him. It makes you wonder about the voters.
Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe write some really great stuff - stuff that would put Oscar Wilde to shame. If the Pet Shop Boys ever wanted a third member, I'd be there.
      There's no point regretting things. If you can't do the time, don't do the crime. Life's too short to worry about things I've said.
      I've got this brilliant thing where I go, "I'm Robbie Williams", and people are interested in what I want to say - which is amazing because I'm just an idiot from Stoke-on-Trent.
      I don't have anything that I treasure at all. They're just things. I tend to buy an awful lot of stuff, like clothes and things. But I wouldn't be bothered if my house burns down tomorrow.
      With the war and everything that's going on, unless you're Susan Sarandon, the best route is to keep your mouth shut. For me it is, anyway!
      I think there are ghosts. I haven't seen or heard anything. I've definitely felt something but it's not scary. I'm very, very pleased to say.
      It's been my favourite album of the last 30 years. You can't argue with how fantastic that album is. (On "What's The Story (Morning Glory)" by Oasis in 2010)
      The world's a lot more exciting with One Direction in it. And more hearts will genuinely race at a new 1D album than they ever have or will at any Suede album in any time period.
      My weight is still my biggest struggle in life. I spend a lot of the day worrying about getting fit, and I can't seem to do it. I've tried everything, and I really worry about it. Then I see the days to a tour, counting down. Chocolate should be banned worldwide.
      I've lived in LA for a long time and they say, 'If you sit in a barber's shop for long enough you will get a hair cut'. Well, if you live in Los Angeles for long enough you're going to get some surgery.
=======================================================
The prodigal son of squeaky clean boy band Take That took a big risk in breaking out alone, but Robbie Williams has enjoyed an extraordinarily successful and colourful career.
Robert Peter Maximillian Williams was born on 13 February 1974 in Stoke-on-Trent. At the age of three, Williams' parents divorced and he went to live with his mother and sister.At school Williams became labelled as mischievous and subsequently his jester nature left him with no GCSEs. With few options left he took a job as a salesman but fate intervened; his mum Jan noticed an article in the local newspaper for a boy band audition. Knowing Williams had already shown promise with his singing and acting abilities, she managed to get him an audition at one of the many being held throughout Manchester. It seemed his rebellious nature at school did him no harm in the end, as his audition was a grand success, so beginning his uphill journey to fame.In 1990, the boy band Take That was formed by manager Nigel Martin-Smith. Williams was the last to join the four other members – Gary Barlow, Mark Owen, Jason Orange and Howard Donald – and at only 16-years-old, was also the youngest. For five straight years, the success of Take That was undisputed, topping the charts time after time and touring the world to sold out stadium gigs. But in 1995, Williams decided enough was enough and announced his departure from the band in his bid to go solo as a singer.Take That's image had always adhered to the typical boy band persona of clean cut living, in keeping with the average age of its fan base, but as soon as Williams left the band he hit the headlines for his outlandish behaviour. Clearly ecstatic to be rid of his managed personality and teen idol status, he was soon photographed partying at the ’95 Glastonbury with Oasis, a band so far from Take That's musical sound and reputation that it was obvious Williams was sending a silent smug message regarding his past five years in the band. He soon changed his own image, wearing grungy clothes, growing a beard and piling on the pounds to gain a significant beer gut: it seemed as though he was intentionally distancing himself from the band that had made him a star.
Williams' intention had always been to go it alone though and in 1996 his solo singing career began with a cover of George Michael's ‘Freedom’, reaching number two in the UK singles chart. Recording for his first album began in March 1996 and meeting songwriter and producer Guy Chambers would be the assurance of success, leading to the pair's long-term collaboration. ‘Old Before I Die’ was the first single released from the debut album, reaching number two, and ‘Life Thru A Lens’ was released in September 1997.
Williams' wild partying in the years following his departure from Take That led him down into the dark and apparently inevitable world of drink and drugs. Before long he found his way along the path endless celebrities take, landing in rehab before the album had even been completed. 'Life Thru A Lens' marked a mediocre success for Williams, failing to make the number one spot and the third single, ‘South of the Border’, sank into a mild oblivion outside of the top ten. Some critics and fans began to question how far Williams was going to be able to take his solo mission, and whether he could compete with even half of the success of Take That.
A meeting with his record label to discuss his future was the turning point for Williams. It was agreed that a fourth single would be taken from the album, and ‘Angels’ became the biggest singing single in the UK and was certified double platinum, selling two million copies worldwide and immediately spiralling 'Life Thru A Lens' sales sky high. UK stardom as a solo artist was most definitively accomplished but Williams had yet to make a huge impact in the international market.
In 1998, Williams and Chambers began writing songs for album number two from Jamaica. Borrowing the musical arrangement used by Nancy Sinatra in James Bond's ‘You Only Live Twice’, the first single, ‘Millennium’, was released in 1998, knocking All Saints' ‘Under The Bridge’ off the number one slot – an ironic coincidence, given that Williams was engaged to one of its band members, Nicole Appleton, at the time. When the album ‘I've Been Expecting You’ was released in October 1998, it shot straight to number one and became the best selling release in the UK for the year. Learning from the first album's initial failure, this time Williams’ record label ensured that publicity was spread outside the UK and the single ‘No Regrets’ impacted well in Europe and Latin America.
The next step for Williams was to crack the American market - a notoriously tricky target for UK artists. He signed to Capitol Records in the US (part of EMI) and embarked on a promotional tour in America. But when Millennium was released in 1999 it plummeted to 72 in the Billboard Hot 100 and his debut album across the pond, aptly titled, ‘The Ego Has Landed’, only peaked at number 63. Despite the chart failure, Williams still received a decent amount of video airplay and was nominated for an acclaimed MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video. He did not scoop the award, but the nomination nonetheless helped to raise his profile significantly.
Despite being in the middle of tours and world promotion, Williams still found time in 1999 to record his third studio album, ‘Sing When You're Winning’. The first single released, ‘Rock DJ’, caused controversy, not because of its musical content but because of its video. Featuring Williams tearing chunks off his skin and muscle while performing a strip show lead to a censoring from ‘Top Of The Pops’ and other channels followed suit. Nevertheless, the track was a huge hit around the globe, winning several awards including Best Song of 2000 at the MTV Europe Awards and Best Single of the Year at the BRITs.
The album's release in August 2000 was a success the world over and entered the UK charts at number one and led to Kylie Minogue approaching Williams to write some songs for her album, ‘Light Years’. Instead, the pair produced the duet single ‘Kids’ and a joint UK tour for two months of sell out dates.
After the success of his third album, Williams decided to take another musical direction. He took two weeks off from his tour to record what would be his fourth studio album, which was characterised by a sound very different to that of his previous releases, becoming the big band album he had always dreamed of making. Born from his life-long love for Frank Sinatra, combined with the success of a jazz style track ‘Have You Met Miss Jones?’ recorded for the film ‘Bridget Jones's Diary’ in early 2001, ‘Swing When You're Winning’ was released in 2001 to instant success worldwide. A duet with Nicole Kidman, ‘Somethin Stupid’, was the first single. A cover of the Frank and Nancy Sinatra hit, it became Willams' fifth UK hit and the album was certified the 49tth Best Selling Album in UK music history. Subsequently Williams was also able to fulfill a lifetime's dream by appearing in a one man showcase at London's Royal Albert Hall.
In 2002, Williams signed a record-breaking £80 million contract with EMI, reportedly the biggest in British history, proving that the high school dropout from Stoke was well and truly a mega star. After a year off from recording, Williams began working on his fifth album. ‘Escapology’ signalled a new era for Williams. He had made a caustic split from his long time collaborator Guy Chambers, with both parties making contrary statements for the parting. This left Williams with a more active role in the making of the new album, indicating his confidence in the studio, and three of the tracks were the first songs that he had written without Guy Chambers' input.
Its release in 2002 hit number-one in the UK but still only found its way to number 43 in the US. A mammoth summer tour in 2003 climaxed with three concerts at Knebworth with a record 375,000 fans turning out to watch him. The shows were released as Williams' first live album in 2003 and it became the fastest selling live album, beating Oasis' sales by double. A year after the live album's release, Williams decided that it was time to take a step out of the limelight and take a fresh perspective on his career to date by working with some new talents. He began collaborating with British songwriter Stephen Duffy in 2004, and a greatest hits compilation was released the same year which hit the number one spot in 18 countries.
After touring Latin America with the greatest hits album, Williams’ sixth studio album, ‘Intensive Care’, was released a year later in October 2005 and continued the constant stream of record selling music, shifting over two million copies in just six weeks. Noting that Williams had managed to dominate the charts for many of his solo years since departing Take That, the former members of the band – who had split in 1996 – agreed to reunite in London for a preview screening of a documentary that was due to be screened on ITV1. When Williams had left the band, mountains of unpleasant rumours had circulated regarding the reasons, most revolving around his dislike for Gary Barlow – nevertheless, there was a high expectation that Williams might let the past rest and attend the screening. However, he still declined the reunion, leaving fans disappointed and the four remaining members to go it alone once more.
Williams' seventh studio album, ‘Rudebox’, received mixed reviews on its release. The first single, of the same name, was premiered on Radio 1 by DJ Scott Mills, causing some controversy when it was aired before the record label's embargo date. The single was panned by many though and ironically, the officially reunited Take That's comeback album, ‘Beautiful World’, sold more copies, ranking the album Williams' lowest selling to date. It seemed that Williams’ change of musical direction had missed the mark, finally producing an album which failed to fly off the shelves. It was not the end though, as faith was apparently restored when a world tour was announced in 2006 which set a Guinness World Record for selling 1.6 million tickets in one single day.
Williams has managed to keep a relatively low profile in the British media since his move to Los Angeles. He has commented in the press several times that he prefers the lifestyle in LA because he enjoys more freedom and privacy than his life in the UK. His constant battle with substance and alcohol abuse have taken a toll on his private life, and he has made a frank public admission about suffering depression, taking part in Stephen Fry's BBC documentary about bipolar disorder. He also developed a reputation for being unable to settle in a relationship for any significant period. Since his split from Nicole Appleton in the late 90s, he had been linked only briefly to several celebrities, including Rachel Hunter, however claims emerged that Williams had finally have found love with American actress Ayda Field. The couple married in a ceremony at the singer's home in Los Angeles on 7 August 2010.
The dating drama was enlivened when his inability to commit to women opened speculation regarding his sexuality, to the point that in 2005 he won a libel case against MGN and Northern & Shell relating to articles which reported he was a closet homosexual. The substantial damages awarded to Williams caused Gay Rights campaigners to ask that he donate the money to gay charities, claiming that his legal case had suggested that Williams was insulted to be labelled gay. Comparisons have been made to a similar case concerning Jason Donavan, which did in turn alienate many of his gay fans. Long term friend, actor and musician Max Beesley has spoken out in the press though, saying, "some of the stuff written about him is enough to make me mad, the rumours about him being gay, for example. Not true. I've never met anybody less gay in my life!"
On 4 October 2007, Williams made a return to the live stage after almost a ten month break in a guest appearance at Mark Ronson's concert in LA. He performed The Charlatans classic, ‘The Only One I Know’, which features on Ronson's album ‘Version’. In January 2008, the long silence since the release of Rudebox in 2005 prompted rumours that Williams was 'on strike' at his record label, EMI. His manager Tim Clark dismissed the claims and insisted plans to record were simply on hold. The new EMI owner Guy Hands told the Financial Times that “we don't have an issue with Robbie Williams. What has happened is that his manager has made a number of statements, but Robbie has not. Robbie has spent a large number of years working full-time and he wants to take 2008 quietly. We do not have a need to push Robbie Williams into making an album.” Tim Clark, Williams' manager, declined to comment.
Roll on two years and it was announced that Robbie was set to release his second greatest hits album, ‘In and Out of Consciousness: The Greatest Hits 1990–2010’, to mark the singer's 20 years in the business. The album included a song, ‘Shame’, written in conjunction with Robbie's old band mate, Gary Barlow. This collaboration added fuel to the rumours that a reunion with Take That was on the cards.
An official announcement was made on 15 July that Robbie Williams had been working with his old boy band, Take That and it was confirmed that the group had written an album together.
The statement issued at the time read: "The rumours are true ... Take That: the original lineup, have written and recorded a new album, to be called ‘Progress’, for release later this year."
On 20 September 2010, the singer released his second book 'You Know Me' in collaboration with Chris Heath. It features photographs of the star over his 20-year career and his comments on them.
In October the same year, Media Control named Robbie as the most successful album-artist of the millennium due to the amount of time he had spent in the German charts.
Robbie and the band also announced that they would be touring together in 2011. The tour, Progress Live 2011, was the fastest selling of any band ever in the UK and culminated with an eight night stint at Wembley Stadium.
On 15 and 16 July 2011, the band were due to perform sold-out gigs in Copenhagen, Denmark as part of their tour but they were forced to cancel them - the first concerts they had ever cancelled - as Robbie had a stomach infection.
In late 2012, Robbie released a solo album, produced by Barlow, called 'Take The Crown'. He then released another swing album in 2013 called 'Swings Both Ways'.
On 6 October 2011, Robbie launched a radio show entitled 'Radio Rudebox' in which he interviewed Barlow and played music.
There have also been rumours that Robbie has left Take That once again following an interview given by Barlow to the Radio Times.
It has since emerged that Barlow meant that the group are on hiatus as both singers are currently pursing solo projects. Watch this space!

        Out of all the members of Take That, Robbie Williams never really seemed to fit in. Roguishly handsome where his bandmates were merely cute, Williams was tougher and sexier than the rest, which made him more distinctive. He also fought regularly with the other members and their management, primarily because he was occasionally adverse to being so heavily packaged. So it didn't come as a surprise that he was the first to leave the band, departing early in the summer of 1995 to pursue a solo career (by some accounts, he was fired from the group).  Although he was the first out of the gate, it took Williams a while to get started. For most of 1995, he attempted to boost his credibility by tagging along with Oasis, hoping that Noel Gallagher would give him a couple of songs. He never did, but all of his time with Oasis launched Williams into a world of heavy partying, drinking, and drugging. Over the course of 1996, he was only heard from in gossip columns, and every published picture indicated he had put on considerable weight. Occasionally, he was quoted as saying his new music would abandon lightweight dance-pop for traditional Brit-pop, but his first single was a cover of George Michael's "Freedom '90." Released late in 1996, the single was a disaster, but his second single, 1997's "Old Before I Die," was more in the vein of his early pronouncements, featuring a distinct Oasis influence. Williams finally released his first solo album, Life Thru a Lens, in 1997. The album became a big hit in Britain, prompting his second, I've Been Expecting You, to go multi-platinum upon its release in 1998. (The Ego Has Landed, a U.S.-only compilation designed for breaking Williams to American audiences, was released stateside in the spring of 1999.) Sing When You're Winning followed in late 2000, gaining success with the video hit "Rock DJ," while a big-band album of standards (Swing When You're Winning) appeared a year later. By this point, Robbie Williams had become one of Europe's premier pop stars, known for his headline-grabbing behavior as much as his hit-studded albums. Moreover, his solo work had sold far more copies than his work with Take That. During 2002, Williams celebrated an enormous new contract with EMI (rumored to be upwards of 80 million dollars), but suffered the loss of his longtime production partner, Guy Chambers. Escapology, the fifth Robbie Williams album (and the last including Chambers' input), sold millions of copies in Europe, though it failed to persuade American audiences. As a result, the 2003 concert record Live at Knebworth wasn't released in the States. He introduced a new musical partner, Stephen Duffy, with a pair of songs from his compilation Greatest Hits, then reappeared in 2005 with Intensive Care. Although the album topped charts in Europe and helped Williams set an impressive concert record -- his 2006 world tour sold over one-and-a-half-million tickets in one day -- a certain creative atrophy was setting in, despite the new input from Duffy.  Within a year, he had recorded and released Rudebox, a dance album recorded with half-a-dozen outside producers, some featured guests, and several covers instead of self-penned material. Rudebox hit number one across Europe but only went double platinum in the U.K., becoming his lowest-selling studio album to date. Accordingly, Williams' next album -- the 2009 release Reality Killed the Video Star -- found him returning to the sound of his older albums, with the Buggles' Trevor Horn handling all production duties.  The following year, most news of Robbie Williams surrounded his reunion with Take That, which took the form of a new album, Progress, plus a few new songs recorded with bandmate Gary Barlow that were released on a new Williams hits collection, In and Out of Consciousness: Greatest Hits 1990-2010. Barlow also figured in the writing and production of the ninth Robbie Williams studio album, Take the Crown, released in late 2012. Produced by Williams alongside Jacknife Lee (Snow Patrol, R.E.M., Bloc Party), the album saw Williams return to the eclectic pop sound of his earlier work, with a trailer single ("Candy") written by Williams and Barlow. The single reached number one across Europe, including the U.K., as did the album, which was certified platinum. For his next release, Williams worked with Guy Chambers again on his second swing album, Swings Both Ways, which comprised a mix of standards and originals. Released in late 2013, it featured a variety of guests including Lily Allen, Olly Murs, Rufus Wainwright, Kelly Clarkson, and Michael Bublé. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi

He rose to fame as a member of the boy band Take That and has experienced continued success with his solo career.Robbie Williams: ChildhoodRobbie Williams was raised in Stoke-on-Trent, by his mother Janet and his father Peter Williams. He also has a sister, Sally.Robbie attended Mill Hill Primary School, followed by St. Margaret Ward's Roman Catholic School in Tunstall.Robbie Williams: Music CareerAlong with Mark Owen, Gary Barlow, Jason Orange and Howard Donald, Robbie Williams formed Take That in 1990. The band became hugely successful, with their debut album spawning four number one singles in the UK.Robbie Williams quit the group in 1995. His increasing drug use had led to a near-overdose before performance at the MTV Europe Awards show. After leaving the band, Robbie Williams was frequently photographed out partying with members of Oasis, especially Liam Gallagher and Noel Gallagher. He even attended Glastonbury Festival with them that year.Robbie William's first solo release was a cover of 'Freedom' by George Michael. It reached number two in the UK singles chart.Williams was then introduced to Guy Chambers, with whom he would have a long-standing songwriting partnership. The debut single, Life Thru A Lens, was released in September 1997. The fourth single from the album, 'Angels' became his best-selling single in the UK and has been certified double platinum.Robbie Williams' second solo album, I've Been Expecting You, was released the following year and was hugely successful. The first track, 'Millenium', was inspired by the work of John Barry (specifically his James Bond music). 'No Regrets' was a collaboration between Williams, Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys and Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy. The fourth single from the album was another cover: 'She's The One' originally featured on the World Party album Egyptology.The Ego Has Landed was Williams's first album for Capitol Records and was released in July 1999 and saw his international profile increase considerably, especially in the USA and Canada.The debut single taken from 2000's Sing When You're Winning was 'Rock DJ'. The song was reportedly inspired by the late Ian Dury. Its follow-up single, 'Kids' was a collaboration with Kylie Minogue.Williams' next album was recorded during a two-week break from touring and was heavily inspired by his love of singers such as Frank Sinatra. The album was entitled Swing When You're Winning and the first track, 'Have You Met Miss Jones?' which was included on the soundtrack for the film adaptation of Bridget Jones' Diary.Swing When You're Winning included a number of duets, with artists including Jane Horrocks, Jonathan Wilkes, Nicole Kidman and Rupert Everett.Robbie Williams signed an £80 million recording contract with EMI in 2002. The contract was well-publicised, as it was one of the highest-value contracts ever signed in the music industry at that time. Williams began writing without the help of Guy Chambers and 'One Fine Day' and 'Nan's Song' were two of the tracks that first wrote on his own. His fifth solo album, Escapology, was released across the globe in 2002.The track 'Something Beautiful' was originally intended for Tom Jones, but the track was reworked and included on Escapology. Shortly after its release, Williams played three live concerts at Knebworth House, which attracted a total of 375,000 fans.In 2004, Robbie Williams started working with Stephen Duffy (also known as Stephen 'Tin Tin' Duffy). Some of his collaborations with Duffy were included on his 2004 Greatest Hits album. One of the tracks, 'Radio' went straight to number one upon its release in the UK.Robbie Williams and Stephen Duffy continued to work together for Williams' next album, Intensive Care. The track 'Ghosts' was inspired by 'Louise' by the Human League.In November 2005, a documentary about Take That was screen ed on ITV1. Robbie Williams decided not to attend the preview screening in Notting Hill West London. The rest of the band was reunited for the event.Williams' next album was entitled Rudebox. The album ventured into dance and electronic territory, far more than his previous album and featured collaborations with William Orbit, Pet Shop Boys, Mark Ronson and Joey Negro. The album received mixed reviews.The single 'Bongo Bong and Je Ne T'Aime Plus', a duet with Lily Allen, was released in Latin America in 2007.2009 saw the release of a new album from Robbie Williams. Entitled Reality Killed The Video Star, the album features production work from Trevor Horn and the first track, 'Bodies', was debuted on Chris Moyles' BBC Radio 1 show.Robbie Williams also stated in 2009 that he felt ready to re-join Take That.Robbie Williams: Personal LifeRobbie Williams has had a number of friendships with high-profile celebrities and has stated that it was Elton John who first booked him into a clinic to deal with his drug addiction.He has been romantically linked with Rachel Hunter and is now dating Ayda Field

"It's just a bit of fun... I love puns. 'The showoff must go on,' I always say."  -Robbie Williams, on the album title The Ego Has Landed
                He is currently Britain's biggest performer, and one of the most successful singers in British history. He has a string of hit songs including "Angels", "Millennium" , "Rock DJ", "She's The One", and "Kids" with Kylie Minogue.            
                He was part of the Take That at the beginning of the '90s, the English equivalent of News Kids on the Block, which meant he was adored and loved by millions of girls (not a bad job if you can get it). In fact, fans were so devastated by the news that he was fired from the band, that there were news reports about hysterical teenagers being in despair, attempted suicides by fans, and help lines being set up.  Robbie Williams' bad boy image doesn't hurt his luck with the gals either. Just ask former squeezes Nicole Appleton of the band All Saints and Geri Halliwell (among others) about their infatuation with self-confessed show off Robbie Williams.            
                One of the most amazing things about Robbie is what he has accomplished in such a short time. He has already had an enormous repertoire of hits including "Angels", the best selling record of 1997 in the United Kingdom, "Millennium", "Rock DJ", "She's The One", and "Kids", with Kylie Monigue. His popularity in England is phenomenal, and even on the Web there are fan sites so devoted that they have almost daily updates of news on him. He is now launching his first stadium tour, the ultimate sign of a big performer. Heck, he was even paid $1.2 million to write his memoirs at the tender age of 27 (at the time of signing the contract).            
                Robert Peter Williams was born February 13th, 1974, in Stoke-on-Tent, a North England town.  The son of Janet and Peter, young Robbie always had the entertainer in him, but never had the academics.  While growing up with his mother and sister Sally after his parents' divorce, Williams enjoyed St. Margaret Ward High School more for its opportunities to be the class clown (his father was actually a comedian) rather than for studying.  take that britain Although he was and still is a fan of Port Vale FC, he aspired to become an actor, and even joined the local theater company. Giving him the experience of a performer (which he presently exercises to great extremes), Williams landed minor roles in productions of musical plays such as Fiddler on the Roof, Oliver and appeared in the soap opera Brookside. With musical experience under his belt, Williams' mother saw the ad for a band that was auditioning potential members and would become a British pop sensation.  A 16-year-old Williams was an instant go, and immediately landed the gig of one fifth of the boy band, Take That.  While the pop group was a smash in the UK, it broke into North America with the hit single, "I Want You Back". After five years of record-breaking success in the UK, and becoming somewhat of a pop phenomenon, it appeared that Take That did not want Robbie Williams back: he was dismissed from the group and the news was one of the biggest stories to hit the British papers.  breaking out Apparently, Williams was not only the joker of the group, but he was also known as the bad seed, thanks to much-publicized acts and his bad-boy ways -- not the right image for a boy band.  But Williams reportedly wanted out anyhow.  He also wanted out of his record contract with Take That's management, which led to a legal battle that lasted half a year.  Although Williams ultimately won and signed with EMI, he lost his ability to be sober and had to go to a rehab clinic for his drug and alcohol habits.   Unfortunately, by the time he had sobered up, his debut album, Life Thru A Lens, which was released in 1997, was met with disappointing sales.   Finally, once "Angels", the fifth single off the album was released, Williams was on his way to stardom, making a comeback as a solo artist.  By the time The Ego Has Landed was released in 1999, Williams was almost deserving of his self-proclaimed ego.  He hit it big with the timely single, "Millennium", which was a Top 10 hit in North America, and followed up with "I've Been Expecting You", "No Regrets", "Strong", and the successful "She's The One".  the ego is soaring After worldwide tours and a lot of press, Williams returned to the music scene with his third album, Sing When You're Winning.  He is definitely winning, thanks to the success of the international hit, "Rock DJ" (which has a very unique accompanying video), as well as the single "Kids", a duet with Kylie Minogue (who he has allegedly been doing more than just singing with).  After the 2001 Brit Awards, Williams certainly has a lot to sing about: he took home a record-breaking 12 awards, including honors for Best British Male Artist, and Best British Single and Video for "Rock DJ".  Williams may love himself, but he also shows a love for the charity organizations that he supports, such as UNICEF, Jeans For Genes (which researches inherited illnesses) and Children's Promise, among others. Meanwhile, Robbie has made a charitable start by donating the proceeds of his 2 million Pepsi deal to charities that help sick children.  Definitely sitting high on the UK throne, Williams seems to be the most popular man in Britain today. Always a tabloid favorite thanks to his womanizing ways (he was engaged to All Saints' member Nicole Appleton several years ago), and an on-and-off feud with fellow ego Liam Gallagher of Oasis (who is incidentally presently with Appleton), his success gives him every reason to think highly of himself.
