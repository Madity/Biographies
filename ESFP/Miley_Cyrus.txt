Miley Ray Cyrus (born Destiny Hope Cyrus, November 23, 1992) is an American actress and singer. Her father is the country singer Billy Ray Cyrus. She held minor roles in the television series Doc and the film Big Fish in her childhood. In 2006, Cyrus rose to prominence as a teen idol after being cast in the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana, in which she portrayed the starring character Miley Stewart. After signing a recording contract with Hollywood Records in 2007, Cyrus released her debut studio album Meet Miley Cyrus. It was certified quadruple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for exceeding four million shipments, and produced the hit single "See You Again".
In 2008, Cyrus released her second album Breakout, which featured the successful track "7 Things", and launched her film career as the voice actress in the animated film Bolt. In 2009, Cyrus starred in the feature film Hannah Montana: The Movie; its soundtrack produced the hit single "The Climb". Cyrus developed a maturing image with the EP The Time of Our Lives (2009), which featured the successful track "Party in the U.S.A.". The transition continued with her third album Can't Be Tamed (2010); however, it made little commercial impact and became the lowest-selling record of her career. Later that year, Cyrus starred in the coming-of-age film The Last Song. During its production, she was involved in an on-again, off-again relationship with her co-star Liam Hemsworth; the couple ultimately separated after ending their year-long engagement in 2013.
Cyrus focused on her acting career with several television and film appearances throughout 2011 and 2012. Cyrus later signed a recording contract with RCA Records, and generated controversy by cultivating a sexually explicit public image while promoting her fourth studio album Bangerz (2013). Its singles "We Can't Stop" and "Wrecking Ball" were promoted with provocative music videos; the latter became her first number-one hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.
Cyrus has had five non-consecutive number-one albums on the U.S. Billboard 200, two of which are soundtracks credited to her titular character Hannah Montana, and has earned numerous awards and nominations. In 2010, Cyrus ranked number thirteen on Forbes' Celebrity 100, and was named the "Most Charted Teenager" in the 2011 Guinness World Records with twenty-nine Billboard Hot 100 entries as of November 2009.[1][2] In 2013, she was declared "Artist of the Year" by MTV.[3]
Destiny Hope Cyrus was born on November 23, 1992, in Nashville, Tennessee, to Letitia Jean "Tish" Finley and country singer Billy Ray Cyrus.[4] Her name was derived from her parents' belief that she would accomplish great things, and she was given the nickname "Smiley", later shortened to "Miley", because she often smiled as an infant.[5] She officially changed her name to Miley Ray Cyrus in 2008; her middle name honors her paternal grandfather, Democratic politician Ronald Ray Cyrus, to whom she remained close until his death in 2006.[6] Against the advice of her father's record company,[7] Cyrus's parents secretly married a year after her birth on December 28, 1993.[8] They had two more children together, son Braison and daughter Noah.[9] Cyrus has two elder maternal half-siblings, Trace and Brandi, and an elder paternal half-brother named Christopher. Christopher grew up with his mother Kristin Luckey in South Carolina.[7] Three of her siblings also eventually entered the entertainment business; Trace as a vocalist and guitarist for the electronic pop band Metro Station,[10] Noah as an actress, and Brandi as a guitarist.[11][12] Cyrus's godmother is entertainer Dolly Parton.[13]
Cyrus grew up on a 500-acre (2.0Â km2) farm in Franklin, Tennessee,[14] a suburb of Nashville, and attended Heritage Elementary School.[15] She was raised Christian and was baptized in a Southern Baptist church prior to moving to Hollywood in 2005.[16] She attended church regularly while growing up and wore a purity ring.[17] In 2001, when Cyrus was eight, she and her family moved to Toronto, Canada while her father filmed the television series Doc.[18] After Billy Ray took her to see a 2001 Mirvish production of Mamma Mia! at the Royal Alexandra Theatre, Cyrus grabbed his arm and told him, "This is what I want to do, daddy. I want to be an actress."[19] She began taking singing and acting classes at the Armstrong Acting Studio in Toronto.[20] In her first role, Cyrus played a girl named Kylie on Doc.[5] In 2003, Cyrus was credited under her birth name for her role as "Young Ruthie" in Tim Burton's Big Fish.[21] During this time, she also auditioned with Taylor Lautner for the feature film The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D and it came down to her and another actress, but Cyrus started doing Hannah Montana instead.[22]
At age 11, Cyrus learned of the casting for what became Hannah Montana, a Disney Channel children's television series about a schoolgirl with a secret double life as a teen pop star. Cyrus sent in a tape auditioning for its best friend role, but received a call asking her to audition for the lead, Chloe Stewart.[23] After sending in a new tape and flying to Hollywood for further auditions, Cyrus was told that she was too young and too small for the part.[24] However, the series' producers invited her for further auditions in light of her persistence and her singing and acting abilities. The following year, Cyrus received the lead position, renamed Miley Stewart after herself.[25] Hannah Montana premiered on March 24, 2006, to the largest audience for a Disney Channel program,[26] and quickly ranked among the highest-rated series on basic cable, elevating Cyrus' wealth and fame.[27] Its instant success helped propel Cyrus to teen idol status.[21] Time magazine reports that Cyrus's "phenom[enal]" success is due partially to her talent and partially to "Disney learning to use its vast, multimedia holdings" and market Cyrus and Hannah Montana appropriately.[28] Cyrus eventually became the first artist to have deals in television, film, consumer products, and music within The Walt Disney Company. As Cyrus' career flourished, Cyrus's mother made several important decisions regarding her daughter's representation. She signed Cyrus with Mitchell Gossett, director of the youth division at Cunningham Escott Slevin Doherty. He is credited with "discovering" her after arranging her auditions for Hannah Montana.[29][30]
On the recommendation of Cyrus' godmother, country singer Dolly Parton, Cyrus's mother signed Cyrus with Jason Morey of Morey Management Group for her music career because of their "good morals" that are "not always the case in this business". Franke Swertlow of The Hollywood Reporter described Parton's advice as "the best advice [Tish] could [have gotten] on who should rep her daughter." Cyrus's mother also recruited Cyrus's father's business manager to manage her daughter's finances. Cyrus's mother continued to co-manage and produce many of Cyrus's career decisions.[31] For her education, Cyrus enrolled at Options for Youth Charter Schools[32] and studied with a private tutor on the set of her television show.[33]
The theme song for Hannah Montana, "The Best of Both Worlds", was released on March 28, 2006.[34] The track is credited to "Hannah Montana", the titular pop star that Cyrus portrays. As with other songs credited to Montana, Cyrus typically dressed as the character when performing the song live.[35] It became Cyrus' first charting song, debuting at number 92 on the Billboard Hot 100.[36] The song also had success in countries such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, where it peaked at number 43[37] and 17,[38] respectively. Dressed as Hannah Montana, Cyrus opened for The Cheetah Girls on twenty dates of their The Party's Just Begun Tour, beginning on September 15, 2006.[39] On October 24, Walt Disney Records released the first Hannah Montana soundtrack. Of the nine tracks on the soundtrack performed by Cyrus, eight were credited to "Hannah Montana" and one, a duet with her father titled "I Learned from You", was credited to Cyrus as herself. Cyrus's first release under her own name had been a cover of James Baskett's "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah", released on April 4, 2006, on the fourth edition of DisneyMania.[40] The soundtrack debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first week sales of 281,000 copies.[41] The album continued to top the chart during its second week,[42] and has sold over 3.7 million copies worldwide.[43] During this time period, Cyrus also released the song "Ready, Set, Don't Go", a collaboration with her father.[44] It became her first Top 40 hit credited as herself, peaking at number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100.[45] It also became her first Top 10 hit on the Hot Country Songs chart, peaking at number 4.[46]
The second season of Hannah Montana premiered on April 23, 2007, and ran until October 12, 2008.[47] Shortly afterwards, Cyrus signed a four-album deal with Disney-owned Hollywood Records.[48] The double-disc record Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus was released on June 26, 2007;[49] the first disc served as the soundtrack to the second season of Hannah Montana, while the second acted as Cyrus' debut studio album. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 326,000 copies.[50] It was later certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.[51] The project spawned Cyrus' debut single as herself, "See You Again", which became her first Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[52] It was eventually certified Platinum in the country, making it her first single to be RIAA certified.[53] The track also had success in countries such as Australia and Canada, where it also peaked inside of the Top 10.[54][55] The follow-up single "Start All Over" was released in early 2008; it failed to match the success of its predecessor, debuting and peaking at number 68 on the Hot 100.[56][57] Numerous songs from the Hannah Montana portion of the album charted worldwide following its release.[58]
During the fall of 2007, the Best of Both Worlds Tour was launched to promote the joint album. With the Jonas Brothers, Aly & AJ, and Everlife as her opening acts, Cyrus toured from October 17, 2007, to January 31, 2008, with stops in the United States and Canada.[59] Tickets sold out in minutes and were scalped for up to $2,500 and an average of $214, well above their $26â$65 face value.[60] A Ticketmaster official commented that "there [hadn't] been a demand of this level or intensity since The Beatles or Elvis."[61] Upon the conclusion of the tour in January 2008, Walt Disney Pictures released Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert, a 3D concert film of the tour, on February 1, 2008, for what was expected to be a one-week run. The film earned over $31 million[62] at the box office and an average of $42,000 per theater, twice the expected total, convincing Disney executives to extend the release for an indefinite run.[63] The film's soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records and Hollywood Records on April 15, 2008.[64]
In February 2008, Cyrus and her friend Mandy Jiroux opened a YouTube account and began posting videos of what they called The Miley and Mandy Show.[65] In May 2008, Gossett, Cyrus's longtime acting agent, left Cunningham Escott Slevin Doherty for United Talent Agency, partially with the hope of "giving Cyrus the major-agency backing that would support a widening career".[31][66] In June 2009, Cyrus left both Gossett and UTA, which had recently negotiated her deals for The Last Song and the fourth season of Hannah Montana, and joined the Creative Artists Agency, which had already represented her for music.[67] Cyrus celebrated her sixteenth birthday at Disneyland with a charity fundraiser for Youth Service America, a youth volunteer service organization.[68]
In April 2008, several provocative images of Cyrus in her underwear and swimsuit were leaked by a teenage hacker who accessed her Gmail account.[69] Cyrus described the images as "silly, inappropriate shots" and stated, "I am going to make mistakes and I am not perfect. I never intended for any of this to happen and I am truly sorry if I have disappointed anyone".[70] On April 25, 2008, Entertainment Tonight reported that a fifteen-year-old Cyrus had posed topless for a photoshoot taken by photographer Annie Leibovitz for Vanity Fair.[71] The New York Times later clarified that though the pictures left an impression that she was bare-breasted, Cyrus was wrapped in a bedsheet and was actually not topless.[72]
In a May 2008 interview with The Los Angeles Times, Francois Navarre, the proprietor of the X17 photo agency, said Cyrus's market value had picked up considerably after the Vanity Fair photo controversy: "She's started to sell more.Â ... It used to be $300, and now it's $2,000 for a picture." Estimates for a picture of the then-15-year-old's first kiss ranged from $30,000 to $150,000. Navarre noted that Cyrus rarely behaved in a manner contrary to her wholesome image or went out without a parent and stated, "She has people waiting for the moment she starts to be less traditional..... It's natural. Any teenager. But it's going to come very fast..... As soon as her mom lets her go out by herself. It's going to start to be interesting."[73] Time magazine included her on the 2008 Time 100, the magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Her write-up was written by former child star Donny Osmond, who warned, "As an idol to tweens the world over, singer-actress Miley Cyrus, 15, is riding a huge tidal wave at the pinnacle of her career; this is as it should be. I hope she enjoys it.Â ... Within three to five years, Miley will have to face adulthood..... As she does, she'll want to change her image, and that change will be met with adversity."[74] Billboard ranked Cyrus the fourth best-selling female artist of 2009[75] That year, at the age of sixteen, she became the youngest artist to have four number-one albums on the charts.[76]
On July 22, 2008, Cyrus released her second studio album Breakout, which she said was inspired by "what's been going on in my life in the past year."[56] Cyrus co-wrote eight out of twelve songs on the album.[56] "Songwriting is what I really want to do with my life forever..... I just hope this record showcases that, more than anything, I'm a writer."[77] Breakout debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 371,000 copies.[78] In doing so, it gave Cyrus her highest first-week sales to date and her third number-one album on the chart. The album went on to receive a Platinum certification from the RIAA, denoting sales of one million copies.[51] Breakout was preceded by the lead single "7 Things", which became her second single to reach the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100.[79] Its second single "Fly on the Wall" failed to have the same success, peaking at number 84 on the Hot 100.[80] However, it peaked at number 16 in the United Kingdom.[81] Cyrus hosted the 2008 CMT Music Awards with her father in April[82] and the 2008 Teen Choice Awards by herself in August.[83] In 2008, Cyrus provided the voice of Penny in the 2008 computer-animated film Bolt, which was released on November 21, 2008, to critical acclaim.[84] Cyrus also co-wrote and recorded the song "I Thought I Lost You" as a duet with John Travolta for the film, for which she received a Golden Globe nomination.[85]
In 2009, Cyrus starred in the feature film Hannah Montana: The Movie. Both the film and its soundtrack, which contained twelve songs performed by Cyrus,[86] achieved commercial success.[87][88] Its lead single "The Climb" became a Top 40 hit in twelve countries[89] and introduced Cyrus to listeners outside her typical teen pop audience.[90] Cyrus had considered ending Hannah Montana after its third season, which finished production on June 5, 2009,[91] but Disney retained and exercised its option for a fourth season.[92] In September 2009, she participated in the charity single "Just Stand Up!" in support of the anti-cancer campaign Stand Up to Cancer[93] and in the City of Hope Benefit Concert in support of cancer research and training programs.[94] She also became involved in Disney's Friends for Change, an environmentalist group, for which she recorded the charity single "Send It On" along with several other Disney Channel stars.[95] Shortly afterwards, Cyrus launched the third Hannah Montana soundtrack, which debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 137,000 copies;[96] its single "He Could Be the One" entered the Top 10 of the Hot 100.[54] In March 2009, Cyrus published Miles to Go, a memoir co-written by Hilary Liftin chronicling her life through age sixteen.[97]
In partnership with Max Azria and Walmart, Cyrus launched her first clothing line in 2009.[98] It was promoted with Cyrus' first extended play The Time of Our Lives on August 31, 2009.[99] Cyrus said The Time of Our Lives "is a transitioning album.Â ... really to introduce people to what I want my next record to sound like and with time I will be able to do that a little more."[100] The album debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200, with first week sales of 62,000 copies.[101] The following week, however, the album rose to number 2 on the chart, selling 153,000 copies.[102] Its lead single "Party in the U.S.A." debuted at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, making it her highest-charting single up to that point.[103] To promote the album, Cyrus embarked on the Wonder World Tour, which included over 50 shows in the United States, England and Ireland. The tour was critically and commercially successful, grossing over $67.1 million worldwide.[104] On December 7, 2009, Cyrus performed for Queen Elizabeth II and numerous other members of the British Royal Family at the Royal Variety Performance in Blackpool, Lancashire.[105]
Cyrus began transitioning into an adult image in late 2008, when her representatives negotiated a deal for novelist Nicholas Sparks to write the screenplay and novel basis for a film that would serve as a star vehicle for Cyrus by introducing her to audiences older than the young fans she had gained through Hannah Montana. Sparks and co-writer Jeff Van Wie developed The Last Song.[106] Production on The Last Song lasted from June 15, 2009 until August 18, 2009.[107] Cyrus starred in The Last Song, which was released on March 31, 2010 and received generally poor reviews, as did Cyrus's performance.[108] Nonetheless, the film was commercially successful, grossing more than $88 million at the worldwide box office.[109] According to box-office analyst Exhibitor Relations, the film marked "a successful transition to adult roles for Miley Cyrus."[110] The fourth and final season of Hannah Montana began airing on Disney Channel on July 11, 2010, and concluded on January 16, 2011.[111]
During production of these projects, Cyrus began recording her third studio album Can't Be Tamed, and additionally appeared on the charity singles "We Are the World: 25 for Haiti" and "Everybody Hurts" for the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[112][113] The album was released on June 21, 2010,[114] and became her last to be released by Hollywood Records. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200; with first-week sales of 106,000 copies, it became Cyrus' lowest first-week sales and her first studio album not to peak atop the Billboard 200 chart. The album has sold 343,000 copies in the United States to date, failing to receive an RIAA certification.[115] The album was preceded by the lead single, "Can't Be Tamed" on May 18, 2010, and peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100.[116] The second and final single "Who Owns My Heart" was released in select European countries.[117][118] In February 2011, Cyrus confirmed she would be embarking on her Gypsy Heart Tour, which featured no North American dates.[119] Cyrus later explained "Right now I just want to go to the places where I am getting the most love and Australia and South America have done that for me."[120] The tour began April 29, 2011 and concluded on July 2 after 21 shows. Cyrus performed on stadiums and at arenas in South and Central America, Philippines and Australia.[121]
Following the release of Can't Be Tamed, Cyrus confirmed she would be taking a break from her music career, opting rather to focus on acting.[122] She commented, "I've not taken, like, acting lessons or anything, but it doesn't mean I don't need to because I'm sure I doÂ ... I'm probably going to go book an acting coach."[123] She later confirmed she would not be going to college for the time being, stating that "[she is] a firm believer that you can go back at any age you want" and "[had] worked hard to get to where [she is] now, and [wants] to enjoy it while it lasts."[124][125] Cyrus hosted Saturday Night Live on March 5, 2011, where she performed in several sketches.[126][127][128] She later made an appearance on the MTV series Punk'd, appearing alongside Kelly Osbourne and KhloÃ© Kardashian.[129][130] In 2012, Cyrus starred in the film LOL alongside Demi Moore, where Cyrus portrayed Lola.[131] The film received a limited release, and was critically and commercially unsuccessful.[132][133][134] Cyrus later starred in the comedy film So Undercover, appearing as an FBI agent who is required to go undercover at a college sorority.[135] It was also reported on August 2, 2011, by Contact Music that Cyrus has signed on to star in a comedy in which she plays a woman who broke a promise to God.[136]
In 2012, Cyrus recorded a cover of the Bob Dylan song "You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go", which was featured on the tribute album Chimes of Freedom: Songs of Bob Dylan Honoring 50 Years of Amnesty International.[137] Beginning in 2012, Cyrus recorded various performances of herself doing covers classic songs.[138] She uploaded these performances onto YouTube throughout the summer and fall of 2012. It was later announced that Cyrus would star the film Family Bond, portraying a girl who meets her spy father in an attempt to save her kidnapped mother.[139] That same year, Cyrus made a guest appearance in the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, appearing in two episodes as Missi, the girlfriend of character Jake Harper.[140] She was also confirmed as a primary voice actress in the feature film Hotel Transylvania, but dropped out of the project to coordinate a musical comeback.[141] On May 31, 2012, Cyrus and Hemsworth became engaged; he proposed to her with a 3.5-carat diamond ring. They had been in an on-again, off-again relationship for 3 years before he proposed.[142] On September 16, 2013, a representative for Cyrus announced after months of media speculation that Cyrus and Hemsworth had decided to call off their engagement; ending their four-year relationship.[143] In 2012, Cyrus generated considerable media attention after cutting her traditionally long, brown hair in favor of a blonde, pixie-style haircut; she commented that she had "never felt more [herself] in [her] whole life" and that "it really changed [her] life".[144][145]
In 2013, Cyrus hired Larry Rudolph as her manager, who had previously worked with Britney Spears.[146] That same year, she left Hollywood Records after signing a recording contract with RCA Records, through which her fourth studio album Bangerz was released in October.[147] "We Can't Stop" was serviced as the lead single from the record on June 3.[148] The track peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100. It also became her first number-one single in New Zealand and the United Kingdom.[149][150] It set a Vevo record after garnering over 10Â million views within 24 hours of its release, and later broke the website's record for being the fastest video to reach 100 million views, accomplishing this feat in 37 days.[151]
While working on the album, Cyrus appeared in various collaborations. She provided guest vocals for the Rock Mafia song "Morning Sun", and provided background vocals for the song "Decisions" by Borgore.[152] Cyrus and Hemsworth later appeared in the music video for the song.[153] Cyrus appeared on the Snoop Lion song "Ashtrays and Heartbreaks", released as the first single for his album Reincarnated on April 4, 2013.[154] She later appeared on the song "Fall Down",[155] which was released as a promotional single for will.i.am's album #willpower on April 16, 2013.[156] The single debuted at number 58 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Cyrus' first single to chart on the Hot 100 since "Can't Be Tamed".[157] The single also debuted inside the Top 20 in Canada,[158] as well as the Top 40 in the UK.[159] On May 23, 2013, it was confirmed that Cyrus would be featured on the Mike Will Made It single "23", alongside artists Wiz Khalifa and Juicy J.[160] She also provided guest vocals on the Lil Twist single "Twerk", which also featured vocals from Justin Bieber.[161] Several additional collaborations saw Cyrus involved with elements of hip hop music.[162]
"Wrecking Ball" was released as the second single from Bangerz. Its accompanying music video was released on September 9, 2013, and set another Vevo record for 19.3 million views in the first twenty-four hours of its release.[163] "Wrecking Ball" became Cyrus' first single to reach number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.[164] On October 2, 2013, MTV aired the documentary Miley: The Movement, which chronicled the recording of Bangerz and featured behind the scenes footage such as Cyrus preparing for her 2013 MTV Video Music Awards performance.[165][166] On October 5, 2013, Cyrus hosted Saturday Night Live for the second time; she received mostly positive reviews from critics, who generally praised her acting talent and stated the episode was "good but not great" and competent, however some critics stated that the episode was "lackluster".[167] On November 5, 2013, rapper Future's "Real and True" was released as a single, which featured Cyrus and Mr. Hudson and an accompanying music video premiered five days later on November 10, 2013.[168] In December 2013, Cyrus announced tentative plans to release an acoustic album in 2014.[169] On January 29, 2014, she played an acoustic concert show on MTV Unplugged, performing songs from Bangerz and featuring a guest appearance from Madonna.[170] It became the highest rated MTV Unplugged in the past decade with over 1.7 million streams.[171] Cyrus was featured in Marc Jacobs' Spring 2014 ad campaign along with Natalie Westling and Esmerelda Seay Reynolds.[172]
In April 2014, Madonna announced that Cyrus would be the guest curator for the month for Art for Freedom, a global digital initiative designed to fuel free speech â to respond, address and protest persecution and discrimination around the world. Cyrus will collaborate with Madonna to select daily submissions which will be showcased on the Art for Freedom website.[173] In the same month, Time again included her on the Time 100. Her write-up was written by Godmother Dolly Parton who stated, "...the girl can write. The girl can sing. The girl is smart. And she doesnât have to be so drastic. But I will respect her choices. I did it my way, so why canât she do it her way?"[174] On June 3, 2014 "Pretty Girls (Fun)", a leftover song from her album Bangerz surfaced on the internet. [175]
Cyrus is commonly recognized as a pop artist. Common Sense Media described the songs from the same album as being "upbeat" and "girl-power" oriented, citing the lyrics to "I Got Nerve" as a prime example.[176] Kirsi Bertolini for Yahoo! also felt that the song featured in Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus featured a girl-power theme, and felt that the songs were "bubbly" and "karaoke-like."[177] CinemaBlend compared the songs from Hannah Montana 2 to songs released by Avril Lavigne and Hilary Duff.[178] The music found on the second disc of the album, though intended to be seen as Cyrus' solo debut, were often noted as being similar in theme and style to that of Hannah Montana songs.[179][180] With the release of her second studio album Breakout, Cyrus began to distance herself from the sound featured on her soundtrack appearances.[181] The album is noted as featuring a wide variety of genres when compared to previous works by the artist.[182] The song "Fly on the Wall", taken from Breakout, is noted as featuring electropop influences in its production, while the song "These Four Walls" is seen as featuring country aspects.[183]
The music taken from the soundtrack of the Hannah Montana movie features a more Country themed sound, in conjunction with the film's plot. The song "Hoedown Throwdown" taken from the film is noted as combining influences of R&B and Country.[184] With the release of Cyrus' 2009 album The Time of Our Lives, Cyrus incorporated a mixture of elements into the songs. "Kicking and Screaming" features instrumentation that relies on glam electric guitar riffing.[185] It is noted as being the most prominent representation of rock music on The Time of Our Lives. The song "Party in the U.S.A." features a mixture of R&B and pop music,[186] while the album's title track is described as being a bouncy, dance-pop song characterized by 1980s synths[187] and a fizzy sound caused by a bubblegum pop background.[185] The music featured on Can't Be Tamed is often noted as being of the dance genre and heavily relies on bass.[188] When speaking about Bangerz (2013), Cyrus stated she felt the album had a "dirty south" feel.[189] Miguel and Frank Ocean were named as musical influences for Bangerz.[190]
Cyrus is a contralto,[191] and with a "Nashville twang" in both her speech and singing voice.[128] Songs such as "These Four Walls" have been noted as prime examples of Cyrus' twangy vocals.[192][193] In her song "Goodbye", Cyrus' vocal performance is more "roosty" with a more "natural-sounding accompaniment"[194] In "Party in the U.S.A.", Cyrus' vocals feature belter refrains.[195] Cyrus' vocals for the song "Obsessed" are noted as being "husky."[196] Throughout her career, Cyrus has experimented with altering her voice. Songs such as "Fly on the Wall" see Cyrus' voice processed to sound different.[197] In "The Time of Our Lives", Cyrus' vocals display a prominent use of auto-tune, and are influenced by New Wave music.[196] The songs taken from her Can't Be Tamed album further explore the use of auto-tune on Cyrus' vocals. The album's title track is noted as using auto-tune throughout various portions of the song's lyrics.[198] When reviewing the Wonder World Tour, Dave Paulson of The Tennessean stated "Cyrus' spectacle sets her apart from nearly every other A-list act touring today. She's not a renowned vocalist by any stretch, but her show's choreography barely provides a moment for her to catch her breath, and she's still able to deliver."[199]
Cyrus performs at the "Kids Inaugural: We Are the Future" concert in Washington, D.C. in January 2009
In his review of the Best of Both Worlds tour, J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post described the concert as "a nearly 90-minute blast of pop in which the charismatic Cyrus â who complained that she wasn't feeling wellÂ â commanded the stage with confidence, performing with a particular swagger."[200] When performing a cover of "I Love Rock & Roll" on the tour, Cyrus performed the song suspended in the air atop of a Harley-Davidson Dyna Fat Bob FXDF 2010 that traveled through the air.[201] Beginning with the release of The Time of Our Lives, Cyrus' performances became somewhat more explicit and controversial in nature. Cyrus's performance of "Party in the U.S.A." at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards incited a media uproar, with some viewers criticizing Cyrus's provocative outfit and inclusion of a brief pole dance as inappropriate for her age, then sixteen, and for her young fans.[202] Conversely, Newsday reported that her sexualization "has been coming for some time."[203] Ian Drew, senior editor of US Weekly, said, "She already has this risque image, so it really wasn't much of a stretch. That's how Britney [Spears] took off. She was the good girl gone bad, and it looks to be working for Miley as well."[203] Her performance of Can't Be Tamed on Britain's Got Talent garnered much controversy. Midway through the performance, Cyrus grabbed a female backup dancer, dipping her low, and simulated a kiss.[204] The performance was met with negative reactions from the media and caused her to release a statement in which Cyrus promised she did not kiss the backup dancer. Cyrus wrote, "It is ridiculous that two entertainers can't even rock out with each other without the media making it some type of story. I really hope my fans are not disappointed in me because the truth is I did nothing wrong. I got up there and did my job which is to perform to the best of my ability."[205]
In August 2013, Cyrus was the subject of widespread media attention and public scrutiny following a controversial performance and duet with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. The performance began with Cyrus performing "We Can't Stop" in teddy bear-themed attire. Following this, Thicke entered the stage singing "Blurred Lines" alternatively with Cyrus, who stripped down to a skin-colored, latex two-piece outfit. Cyrus subsequently touched Thicke's crotch area with a giant foam finger and twerked against his crotch.[206][207] An article published in The Hollywood Reporter described the performance as "crass" and "reminiscent of a bad acid trip". Controversy over the performance largely overshadowed the attention that was given to other major events of the night, such as the reunion of 'N Sync and performances by Lady Gaga and Katy Perry.[208] Cyrus' performance was described by XXL critic B. J. Steiner as a "trainwreck in the classic sense of the word as the audience reaction seemed to be a mix of confusion, dismay and horror in a cocktail of embarrassment",[209] while the BBC said she stole the show with a "raunchy performance".[210] The performance also became the most tweeted about event in history, with Twitter users generating 360,000 tweets about the event per minute; breaking the previous record held by BeyoncÃ©'s Super Bowl XLVII halftime show performance six months earlier.[211] News and social media sites featured numerous articles about parental concerns with the performance's impact on children.[212] Cyrus' performance was reported to contribute towards the dehumanization of black women by mimicking "ratchet culture" and using them as living props, swatting one on the backside.[213] Reacting to the controversy, Cyrus stated about her critics: "They're overthinking it. You're thinking about it more than I thought about it when I did it."[214]
Cyrus has a heart condition called Tachycardia, which is a resting heart rate exceeding normal.[215] In early 2014, Cyrus suffered an allergic reaction to the antibiotic, Cephalexin, prescribed to her to treat a sinus infection.[216] Due to the allergy, Cyrus was hospitalized at a Kansas City hospital.[217]
In 2011, Hilary Duff presented Cyrus with the first ever Global Action Youth Leadership Award at the 1st Annual Global Action Awards Gala due to her support of Blessings in a Backpack, an organization that works to feed hungry children at schools, as well as her personal Get Ur Good On campaign with the Youth Services of America. Cyrus stated- "I want (kids) to do something they love. Not something that seems like a chore because someone tells them that's the right thing to do or what their parents want or what's important to people around them, but what's in their heart."[218][219] In the same year, Cyrus visited Haiti twice with the Starkey Hearing Foundation. During the first visit in March 2011, she helped distribute hearing aids to those in need. She returned in October 2011 for the second mission as part of the Foundationâs Listen Carefully campaign. Cyrus appeared in a series of public service ads on behalf of the campaign, and also utilized her Get Ur Good On Facebook page to reach fans with the message. Fans were also invited to enter a sweepstakes for a chance to win a "listening experience" during a sound check at the So The World May Hear Awards Gala where she talked about her experience, performed The Climb among other signature hits, and met with sweepstakes winners. Cyrus stated- "After I went on my first mission to Haiti with the Starkey Hearing Foundation, I felt so drawn to helping others hear for the first time and immediately wanted to look for another chance to go back and help again... I grew up around music with my brothers and sisters and couldn't imagine what it would be like if we couldn't hear the magic of music â itâs had such an influence on my life â so I want everyone to have the ability to enjoy sound as it was intended."[220][221]
In 2012, Cyrus organized a fundraiser for her 20th birthday and encouraged fans to donate to Starkey Hearing Foundation and animal charity Saving Spot! Dog Rescue. For her 20th birthday, activists at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals adopted a pig called Nora, in Miley's name.[222][223] In the same year, Cyrus was recognized as the second most charitable celebrity behind Taylor Swift.[224] Cyrus supports the Libby Ross foundation, for which she decorated a yoga bag and auctioned it. She additionally supports 39 well-known charities including Make-a-Wish Foundation, Youth Service America, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Elton John AIDS Foundation, Amnesty International and MusiCares, among several others. She is also involved with Musicians on Call, a charity that brings live and recorded music to the besides of patients to promote the healing process. She agreed to perform at a concert benefitting this organization, joining Jordin Sparks and Gavin DeGraw.[225] In 2012, the Make-a-Wish Foundation gave Miley the first annual World Wish Day Star Award.[226] Also, she was announced to be the most requested female celebrity wish granter in the history of Make-A-Wish.[227] In 2013, Miley was named the 14th most charitable celebrity of the year by Do Something.[228] In 2013, Cyrus appeared alongside Justin Bieber and Pitbull in a television special entitled "The Real Change Project: Artists for Education".[229]
Cyrus has stated that she dated singer and actor, Nick Jonas from June 2006 to December 2007.[230] Cyrus claimed they were "in love" and began dating soon after they first met.[231] Cyrus dated underwear model, Justin Gaston for nine months in 2009.[232] While filming The Last Song in June 2009, Cyrus began a relationship with her co-star Liam Hemsworth whom she called her "first serious boyfriend".[233] After three years of having an on-again, off-again relationship, the couple announced their engagement in June 2012 but ended their relationship in September 2013.[234]
Cyrus has a Christian faith, and was baptized in a Southern Baptist church in 2005.[16] Cyrus is an avid supporter of gay rights, and is often vocal about her beliefs on the topic. In 2012, she named London as her favorite place to perform due to its extensive gay scene.[235] Cyrus' song "My Heart Beats for Love", taken from her Can't Be Tamed album, was written about one of Cyrus' gay friends,[236] and is dedicated to all of Cyrus' gay fans.[237] In May 2013, Maxim ranked Cyrus first in their Hot 100 of the year.[238] In July 2013, Cyrus posed nude for a "Protect the Skin You're In" T-shirt, part of a campaign by fashion designer Marc Jacobs to raise awareness and cash for melanoma research. All of the sales will benefit the NYU Cancer Institute and NYU Langone Medical Center.[239]
In several interviews Cyrus has mentioned her use of cannabis.[240] However, rumors addressing her use of cannabis before 2013 were denied. In a video obtained by The Daily, taking place at Cyrus' 19th birthday party at the Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles, Cyrus went to the microphone and addressed the crowd. Immediately after her Bob Marley-themed birthday cake had been brought out, Cyrus said, "You know you're a stoner when your friends make you a Bob Marley cake. You know you smoke way too much fuckin' weed." Cyrus' representative later stated that the Bob Marley cake had just been a "joke" and that Cyrus' response had been "sarcastic".[241] In a 2013 Rolling Stone interview, Cyrus said cannabis was "the best drug on earth" and called it, along with MDMA, a "happy drug".[242] On November 10, 2013, while accepting the Best Video award at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards, Cyrus smoked what appeared to be a joint on stage, which was removed from the delayed broadcasting of the program in the United States.[243] In a 2014 interview with W Magazine, Cyrus stated "I love weed" and "I just love getting stoned."[244] Cyrus was chosen by TIME magazine as one of their finalists for Person of the Year in November 2013.[245] She came in third place with 16.3% of the vote.[246] In March 2014, Skidmore College, New York started offering a special topics sociology course entitled "The Sociology of Miley Cyrus: Race, Class, Gender and Media" which will be "using Miley as a lens through which to explore sociological thinking about identity, entertainment, media and fame." [247]
In 2007, Cyrus earned $18 million. In 2008, Cyrus earned $25 million and was ranked number 35 on Forbes magazine's Celebrity 100 list.[248] Parade magazine reported she was the richest teenage celebrity and that her franchise would be worth approximately $1 billion by the end of the year.[249] In 2009, Forbes ranked her No. 29 on the Celebrity 100 and reported she had earned a total of $25 million.[250] In 2010, Forbes ranked her at 13 on their Celebrity 100, earning $48 million[251] from June 2009 to June 2010. She was the 4th highest earner under 30 years old and the youngest on the list.[252] From working on Hannah Montana, Cyrus was paid $15,000 per episode, making her the sixth-highest paid child star on television, behind fellow Disney stars Dylan and Cole Sprouse and Keke Palmer with $20,000 for their shows.[253] At age 17 she was named No. 19 on the "Top 20 World's Richest Female Singers of All Time" list, with over $100 million in earnings in five years, which made her the youngest female artist on the list.[254] In 2011, she was named No. 1 on the Top 10 Richest Teens in Hollywood, with $120 million.[255]
On May 30, 2014, while Cyrus was overseas on tour, her house was burglarized and jewellery along with her Maserati worth $102,500 was stolen. This was the second time Cyrus' house had been robbed, the first having been in November 2013.[256]

Her dad is a "recluse" at this point, pulling back from the aftereffects of his "Achy Breaky Heart" fame. Theirs is a full house, with Miley and five other kids. The smiling darling earns the nickname "Smiley," that with time gets shortened to "Miley." 2003Baby StepsAs Billy Ray's returns to showbiz with acting roles in the series Doc, Miley wants to follow suit, despite her father's efforts and painful rejections at auditions. "I'd see those little tears come down her face and I'd hold her and say, 'Enjoy being a kid. There is too much heartache to mess up your childhood,'" Billy Ray tells PEOPLE. But there's no keeping her down on the farm. "She kept stepping up to the plate, and danggone, the right opportunity came at the right time." Those steps include a guest spot on Doc, and a part in Tim Burton's Big Fish. 2005All in the FamilyMiley, 13, wins the lead role in the new Disney series, Hannah Montana, after initially being rejected because she was "too small, too young". She plays an average teen with a double life as a famous pop singer, and Billy Ray is cast as her dad. "I feel like I can tell my dad anything," she tells PEOPLE. "When we come home, we forget that we even work together and just hang out."2006March 24The Fan FareHannah Montana becomes cable's most-watched show for kids ages 6 to 14. Its success continues in song with the Hannah Montana soundtrack album debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200, eventually going triple platinum. Miley's appeal is "charisma and a very winning personality that's easily conveyed by both television and live performance," says Billboard touring editor Ray Waddell. "She's totally non-threatening to parents and a must-see for her target audience." 
2007June 26A Touring MileyMiley releases her follow-up album, Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus, which sells 1.1 million copies. In October, Miley embarks on a 54-date concert tour, and tickets are snapped up as fast as Billy Ray's footwork during his run on Dancing With the Stars. Some fans complain that the tickets are sold out before they get a shot, prompting at least four states attorneys general to launch investigations about ticket sales. 
JulyNick Jonas & Miley CyrusPEOPLE reports Miley is dating Nick Jonas (right), 14, youngest member of the Jonas Brothers. With his brothers, Nick guest-stars in a ratings record-setting episode of Hannah Montana in August and tours with Cyrus.

July 22Pop and MeBilly Ray and Miley appear on the cover of PEOPLE, where he discusses raising Miley so she doesn't follow the same path as former Disney stars Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan. "Everything is about keeping her grounded," his wife Tish tells PEOPLE. "I still threaten her with a wooden spoon to the butt!" In the Cyrus household, Miley is required to do chores, attend church each week with the family and gets grounded as punishment. Miley's Alleged PregnancyAfter gracing the cover of CosmoGIRL!, press of a different nature surfaces on the web. "Someone scanned the page, altered it and then posted it on the Internet," Janet Giovanelli, J-14's editor-in-chief, tells the New York Times of the story that started Miley pregnancy rumors. The original story, titled "Miley's Gross Habits," was a fun piece about joking with her Disney co-stars. The magazine issued a statement debunking the doctored report and emphasizes Miley as "an intelligent, respectable role model for young girls." 2008April 27Miley's Photo ScandalAfter candid photos of Cyrus showing her bra surface online, a semi-clothed Vanity Fair shot of Cyrus makes the media rounds â and causes a big to-do for the child-friendly star. "My goal in my music and my acting is always to make people happy," the singer, 15, tells PEOPLE. "For Vanity Fair, I was so honored and thrilled to work with Annie [Leibovitz]. I took part in a photo shoot that was supposed to be 'artistic' and now, seeing the photographs and reading the story, I feel so embarrassed."

      She has English, along with smaller amounts (to varying degrees) of Scottish, Irish, Welsh, French, Dutch, and German, ancestry.
      There's no right or wrong, success or failure. I don't look at things as black or white. My life won't be a series of either/ors -- musician or actor, rock or country, straitlaced or rebellious, this or that, yes or no. The real choices in life aren't that simple.
      I want to be Snooki, I love her. I'm obsessed. She's one of the only people I've asked for an autograph and a picture from because I love her and I'm inspired by her.
      [on Britney Spears] I love how successful her music is doing right now and [I am] just proud of her. You know, another Southern girl... I love that.
      [observation, 2013] I'm at a point where it's like I know who I am, but I know that I'm not finished figuring that out, and I know I won't be finished until I'm in the dirt.
      People are watching like 'Cute cat plays with yarn' for three hours, a lot more than they're watching anyone else's music video. And it's because it makes them happy, it makes them laugh, whatever. I wanted my video to make people laugh 'cause I'm the first one to make jokes about myself. My godmother is Dolly Parton who is constantly making fun of herself. She's like, 'It takes a lot of money to look this cheap, honey'. I wanted the video to be that kind of confident.
      I really don't like coke (cocaine). It's so gross and so dark. It's like what are you, from the Nineties? Ew.
      Hopefully my hair grows really quick and next time you see me I'll have a pony down to my butt. I just always want to be different. Everyone else has cut their hair to look just like me, so now I got to do something different. I don't like when you walk in and you see a bunch of other yous.
      [on being in the spotlight] I said I was going to take a year off before I made this record. But it's hard to take a break. It's almost depressing when you're not working. You're so used to people calling your name, and that energy, and when you don't have it anymore . . . That's why I never complain about people wanting autographs or pictures. Because if there were a few days where no one asked, I'd probably be like, "What the fuck's going on? Do people not like me?" I hate the paparazzi - but when they're not sitting there waiting for you, you're like "Who's bigger news? Who are you trying to get a picture of?"
      The thing about L.A. is it's pretty much always nice out here. Even when it was 100 the other day, I loved it. It felt good. I worked on my album in Philly, and I would take the train to New York on the weekends, and I'd get off the train and immediately want to die. I would just hate my life. And I'm from Nashville, which is kind of similar - when it's hot, it's fucking miserable. But Nashville, at least it kind of rains in the summer. I don't even remember the last time it rained out here. I always wondered how those big-ass fires start in L.A., and then I'll throw my cigarette out the window or something, and I'm like "There it is."
      I love animals, but I don't really like riding animals. Like, I don't love being on a horse - it's just not my thing. I feel kinda bad. Like, I just want to pet you. I don't really want to put you to work. But cats - cats are fucking creepy. Oh my God, cats are creepy. Every time I see a cat, I think it's gonna turn on me. It's gonna turn for the worst. I don't ever see loyalty in cats. They're gonna scratch you, and then run away. Same with little dogs. Did you know Yorkies were bred to kill mice in the Queen's palace? I had a Yorkshire Terrier, and if I was a rat, it definitely would have eaten me. And Chihuahuas are the most scary animals on the planet. I'm terrified of Chihuahuas.
      I want to be the cool chick that everyone wants to be friends with. I want the people who watch my shows or watch my videos to be like, "She looks like the most fun person to hang out with ever. I want to be that girl's best friend. I want to party with her." It's like, if you're hanging out with BeyoncÃ©, it's almost like you're hanging out with a goddess. She's like a real queen. It's a different realm. Where my thing is kind of the opposite. My shtick is I'm the homey.
      It's coming out soon, so right now I'm listening to it 20,000 times to make sure it's perfect. I have to make sure every detail is perfect. There are albums that people still are listening to, like Michael Jackson's "Bad", because it's so fucking dope. I want people to listen to my album like that. There's a line Ludacris says on my album that goes, "If I die before my time, at least I'll still be living through my music". That's something I've said over and over again. Like, I have one Pixies record that is a time for me - from the time I was 16 until I was 18, the Pixies is all I listened to. And I'm going to be that artist to so many people, so I want to make sure my record is the best it can be. I'm trying to set a new standard for pop music. So it has to live up.
      I've always dreamed of going into space. I'm going to go at some point. Virgin Galactic is taking a ship up next year - I'm trying to get on there right now. I've got a friend who invested in it, and he can kind of hook it up. I want to be one of the first ones. I thought the only way I would ever be allowed to go to space was if I was an astronaut. I never thought it was gonna be, like, a plane trip. At some point it's gonna be a normal fare. Right now it's like a billion dollars. But at some point it's gonna be like going to Australia.
      [on her wrecking ball video] It's the opposite of the VMAs. It's like the SinÃ©ad O'Connor video [for "Nothing Compares 2 U"], but, like, the most modern version. I wanted it to be tough but really pretty - that's what Sinead did with her hair and everything. The trick is getting the camera up above you, so it almost looks like you're looking up at someone and crying. I think people are going to hate it, they're going to see my ass and be like, "Oh my God, I can't believe she did that" - and then when we get to the bridge, they're gonna have a little tear and be like, "Fuck you!" I think it will be one of those iconic videos, too. I think it's something that people are not gonna forget. Hopefully an artist 30 years from now will be like, "Yo, you remember that Miley Cyrus video? We gotta do something like that".
      I like Workaholics (2011) a lot. American Horror Story (2011) is my favorite show - it's so good, so scary. I think I'm gonna start Downton Abbey (2010) next, but I don't know if it's my vibe. I always thought that shit was too hipster. And Breaking Bad (2008) I just got into, but I haven't been able to keep up with it as much. There's just a lot of him coughing. I'm in the first season, and the coughing is driving me crazy. Like, we get it. You're dying. Do you really need a whole two-minute scene of another cough attack? It's too much. In every bad situation, how does he get out? He just starts coughing.
      It's always weird when things are targeted for young people, yet they're driven by people that are like 40 years too old. It can't be like this 70-year-old Jewish man that doesn't leave his desk all day, telling me what the clubs want to hear.
      I'm so scared the sky's not going to be blue anymore. It's going to be black from all the shit.

She was passionate about acting from a young age, appearing in her father's TV series âDocâ and in Tim Burton's âBig Fishâ. In 2004, Cyrus beat out 1,000 hopefuls to land the starring role of Miley Stewart in the hit Disney show âHannah Montanaâ. The tween series features a young pop superstar (Montana) who hides her celebrity identity to be an everyday teen in real life (Stewart). To accommodate filming, the entire family moved to Los Angeles, California, in 2005; Billy Ray plays her fictional dad-manager on the show. Cyrus released a successful Hannah Montana soundtrack album in 2006. In 2007, her double album âHannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrusâ launched a Best of Both Worldsâ tour. The concerts sold out in record time, and the show was extended by 14 dates to help placate disappointed fans. Her successful 3-D concert film collected $31.3 million in its opening weekend in February 2008. Cyrus is also a spokesperson for Daisy Rock Guitars and has her own clothing line, and it has been reported that she earned $18.2 million in 2007. Cyrus changed her legal name to Miley Ray Cyrus in 2008. That same year, she found herself in the midst of a controversy for posing for revealing photographs taken by famed photographer Annie Leibovitz, which appeared inVanity Fair magazine. The resulting criticism and media frenzy did little damage to her career, however. Her album âBreakoutâ (2008), was a huge hit, reaching the top of the pop album charts. In early 2009, Cyrus provided a look into her life with the autobiography âMiles to Goâ. The book features previously unseen photos, family stories and "a look at her inner circle of loved ones." "I am so excited to let fans in on how important my relationship with my family is to me," Cyrus said in a statement. "I hope to motivate mothers and daughters to build lifetimes of memories together and inspire kids around the world to live their dreams." Enthusiasm for her television alter ego remains strong as well. In April 2009, âHannah Montana: The Movieâ scored at the box office, bringing in more than $79 million. Cyrus followed that with the release of an album titled âCan't Be Tamedâ in 2010, her third studio album. The young superstar has also made headlines for her romantic life. In June 2009, she reunited with former boyfriend Nick Jonas of the musical group the Jonas Brothers. Cyrus was also previously linked to model Justin Gaston, and actor Liam Hemsworth. She described Hemsworth as her "first serious boyfriend" but announced in August 2010 that they were no longer together. However, it is thought the couple have reunited, after being spotted together in 2011. In 2010, Cyrus starred in âThe Last Songâ, a movie based on the Nicholas Sparks book of the same name. Although some critics slated her performance, the film was a commercial success.  The star hit the headlines later that year when a video emerged of her performing a provocative dance at the film's wrap party. However, the teenager's actions were defended by her father Billy Ray Cyrus, who said his daughter was simply "having fun" and behaving like a teenager, adding "it's what people her age do".  In 2010, Cyrus' father filed for divorce from her mother, citing irreconcilable differences. However, he announced in March 2011 that the couple are no longer separating.

 Â âThere are multiple sides to all of us. Who we are and who we might be if we follow our dreams.âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  -Miley CyrusÂ Â Three years ago, Miley Cyrus was a virtual unknown. Her life in rural Tennessee was filled with family, friends, school, cheerleading, and the daily tasks of living on a farm. And then came a little show called Hannah Montana. Â Almost overnight, Miley would rocket to superstardom, becoming a television and singing phenomenon. Quiet days were replaced with sold-out concerts, television appearances, and magazine shoots. But through it all, Miley has remained close to her family and friends and has stayed connected to the Southern roots that made her so strong. Â In Miles to Go, Miley offers an honest, humorous, and often touching story of one girl's coming-of-age--from private moments with her pappy to off-roading with her dad, Billy Ray, to herÂ run-ins with mean girls. Miley talks about suffering through drama and heartbreak and coming out the other end unscathed (relatively). And now for the first time, she will discuss it allÂthe milestones still left toÂ reach (driverâs license! voting!), dreams to live out (travel to Asia! find true love!), and the lessons to be learned (remembernig to enjoy every moment!). Â This is a truly unique look inside the world of one of todayâs biggest and brightest stars as she tackles looking back and moving forward.

       Miley Cyrus grew up on a farm in Franklin, Tennessee, before heading to Hollywood and superstardom playing Hannah Montan on the hit Disney Channel show. A triple threat, the sixteen year-old has acted, sung, and danced her way to numerous awards, including Favorite TV Actress and Best Performance in a TV Series at the Kids' Choice Awards as well as Favorite Artist at the Teen Choice Awards (to name only a few). Her first solo album, Breakout, debuted at number one on the Billboard charts and has since gone on to sell over a million copies. When not keeping busy with her work obligations, Cyrus is very involved with several charities. In 2008, the first-time author was chosen as one of Time magazine's World's 100 Most Influential People as well as The Hollywood Reporter's Women in Entertainment Power 100.

  This book, "Miles to go" by Miley Cyrus was a fun read for me.WillowAs a sociologist, I really think it is a great look into the life of a teenager, to see how a teenager deals with the pressure put on them by having an adult job.Ellalove2ReadMy 14 year old daughter breezed through this book because she had a hard time putting it down.Jan E. Edwards
  For all the flack and negative press that Miley Cyrus gets, you'd never think that anything she could write would be worthwhile. But it is.Let's face it, average 16 year olds are boring. Most of them haven't had enough interesting things happen to them that they could fill 250+ pages.But nothing about Miley Cyrus is average. In this heartwarming book Miley talks about many of the trials and tribulations that made her the person she is today.Some of the topics she writes about include: her family, her grandfather and the inspiration he was to her, dealing with being bullied in sixth grade, the struggle it took to get the part of Hannah Montana, touring, writing music, losing a friend, dealing with low self esteem, an illness, a certain Jonas Brother, the struggle to become friends with a cast mate, and much more.Overall, it's a very good book, and definitely worth your time. A must read for all MIley fans.
  For those of you who want to bash Miley because her life has been "perfect" and you think fame and fortune have been handed her on a silver platter, I suggest you read this book. For those of you who think it's only a matter of time until Miley falls off the deep end like all the other teen stars, I suggest you also read this book.Miley's self-told story is both moving and enlightening. She becomes very vulnerable to her readers, telling us of her struggles and her victories. She is very open about her faith, her family and her convictions. She does not shy away from using Bible verses and expressing her views on morality and Hollywood culture. If you have a tween/teen daughter this is a GREAT book for them to read. If Miley can stand by what she believes then so can they.
  My daughter is a BIG fan of Miley so I bought the book for her, but little did I know how much I wanted her to read this.When we read about the three bully girls standing over Miley in the lunch room and how she got through it, it was what I would teach my child to do...and I can relate.  Then when we read page 46 and how she looked to Psalm 25 from the bible for help I teared up, it was so beautiful.  I also love the bond she has with her parents, help us hold on to our children.Thank you Miley, for giving this book to our daughters.
  Well...I've gotta say this book is good. I really appreciate her honesty and openness and think teens will be able to relate. I especially liked her openness about the bullying she experienced, as that's a topic I deal with often with teen girls, and thik it will be extremely helpful to them to know that it's not their fault and they are not alone. Good job, Miley!!-Kate Whitfield, Author of The Empowered Gal's 9 Life Lessons: Keys, Tips, Strategies, Advice & Everything You Need to Know to be a Confident, Successful, in Control Gal
  I love this book so much. It really gave me an insight to what the real Miley Cyrus is like. After reading this book I like her so much more, I had a completely different image of her and I realized I can totally relate to her and she's just like anyone else. Even if you're not a Miley fan, you will love this book. :)
  This book is really good so far!!! Read it!!! The book will give you support that Miley has gone through school problems like regular kids go through every day....Read it you will get to know Miley better than ever before! She has been in alot of problems with school the pressure of auditioning cheerleading tuffys....everything!!! So read this book!! I hope this review helped you!!
  There is a lot of negativity towards Miley and many laught at the idea of a biography by a 16 year old. However if they read the book they should humble down. I don't think the 1-star reviewers read it. For one thing, it is not a biography. It is a memoir of the early life of a rising star and teen idol. It's not something you get to read about a lot and this makes it interesting. The book is also very nicely written, Miley has some talent or had really good help. The book also contains some "shocking" facts the the tabloids debated about, but never knew quite the truth, so it will be a very interesting read for your Miley-loving child. It would be good for adults who think Miley is a bad role model, to read it too. My daughter loves this book and I as a sociologist also spared an hour to read it and found it quite an interesting account of a life, most of us never know.
  I think this book is surprising and amazing.  Even if your not  big fan of Miley Cyrus anyone can read this book.  She writes with realism and really shows you who Miley Cyrus really is and that her life isn't perfect.  She shares the big wait and audition process for Hannah Montana and that shes got turned down many times.  She was bullied in sixth grade.  Prince Charming Nick Jonas her first love and how it didn't work out and wrote all the songs about him.  Miley Cyrus talks about normal girl problems like Braces and Periods and how amazingly close her family is to he.  Buy this book Miley Cyrus is an incredible girl who as grown as a person and how she has many more miles to go.
      It was AMAZING to learn where all of her inspirations for her songs came from, and  I really enjoyed reading it!!!!!!!!
      When my friend read it and she told me that her book was awesome,cool  Miley to go is amazing in the story tittle are good
      This book was very well written by Miley, although, unfortunately, she has changed dramatically since she wrote this book.
      Great story and would recommend to all ages. I don't usually read this type of book but for what it is it's not a bad read considering it's from a teenagers point of view.
      Guess it is ok as I gave it as a gift and suppose it was ok as I received a thank you for it....would never have given that book if I had known that Miley would turn into what she...
      All the 1-star "reviews" of this book are attacks on Miley's character or style of clothing or whatever, and not about the book itself. Some reviewers even said it was boring.
      this book was purchased for my grandchild who until recently loved Miley. The book was down to earth and she thoroughly enjoyed it
      I didn't think this was gonna be good but it was magnificent!!! I would tell everyone about this book! Try!-!
      and I got my lower back operated on and I was on a morphine drip.  Yes, they still use morphine all the time in the hospital.

        Miley Cyrus became an overnight sensation in 2006 as the lead of the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana, but as the years went on, she established herself as a pop star in her own right. Overnight popularity wasn't a new thing for the Cyrus family; Miley's father, country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, went from obscurity to stardom in a few short months in 1992, when "Achy Breaky Heart" became a crossover hit. The success of "Achy Breaky Heart" was hardly the only memorable event for Billy Ray that year, though, as he and his wife welcomed their daughter Destiny Hope Cyrus into the world on November 23, 1992. Destiny's cheerful disposition as a child earned her the nickname Smiley, which stuck when it was shortened to Miley.  Miley's career as a professional actress began in 2003, when she appeared alongside her father in an episode of the television series Doc. The same year, she landed a small role in the Tim Burton film Big Fish. The budding actress had also developed an interest in writing songs and learning how to sing, and in 2005, she landed a role that allowed her to put her skills in acting and music to work. Miley was cast in the title role of Hannah Montana, in which she played a teenage girl leading a double life: by day, she's Miley Stewart, an ordinary kid dealing with school, friends, siblings, and all the other foibles of life for a 14-year-old, while at night she dons a wig and becomes Hannah Montana, a multi-platinum pop star whose career is guided by her dad, songwriter Robby Stewart. Miley's friends don't know she's also Hannah, however, and keeping this a secret is no simple matter. After debuting in March 2006, Hannah Montana became an immediate success with young viewers and led to the release of a soundtrack CD in October, featuring Miley singing eight songs from the show along with five related tracks (including a duet with her father, Billy Ray, on "I Learned from You").  That fall, Miley hit the road as the opening act for another Disney-spawned pop act, the Cheetah Girls. A reissue of the Hannah Montana album followed in March 2007, not long after the show's theme song, "The Best of Both Worlds," was released as a single. A second Hannah Montana record, Hannah Montana 2/Meet Miley Cyrus, was released in summer 2007. That fall, Cyrus embarked on the Best of Both Worlds tour, which stretched into early 2008 and was edited into The Best of Both Worlds Concert film, which was released that spring. By then, Cyrus was busy recording Breakout, her first full-fledged album as herself, as well as shooting Hannah Montana: The Movie, which was slated for release the following year.  Breakout arrived in summer 2008. It topped the Billboard charts and quickly went platinum, paving the way for an even more successful year in 2009. Hannah Montana: The Movie was released that March and peaked at number one, while the soundtrack's lead single -- a country-pop ballad called "The Climb" -- became one of the year's most omnipresent songs, giving Miley her first multi-platinum hit. A short album, The Time of Our Lives, arrived several months later and yielded another hit with "Party in the U.S.A.," which charted inside the Billboard Top Ten for 16 weeks. Cyrus performed the song on the "Wonder World Tour," her first international tour, and also found time to film another movie, The Last Song, which hit theaters in 2010. With acting assuming such a large role in her life, Cyrus announced her decision to take a hiatus from music -- but not before the release of her third album, Can't Be Tamed, which appeared that summer. After making a number of television appearances and appearing in the films LOL and So Undercover, Cyrus decided to return to music, choosing to go in a more grown-up direction by enlisting a number of popular rap producers, including Pharrell Williams. The resulting effort, entitled Bangerz, combined crunky beats with synth pop, electro, and stadium rock tropes. Released in October 2013, it was promoted by Cyrus with a controversial performance at the MTV VMAs, which seemed to get the whole world talking about her. ~ Mark Deming & Andrew Leahey, Rovi

That's just me, because I really am genuinely happy finally with myself, which I think sometimes it takes you separating yourself from someone else to really be happy with who you are. I've never been able to just be alone, and I'm obsessed with being alone and like hearing my thoughts."
