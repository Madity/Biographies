=======================================================
Marina Lambrini Diamandis (born 10 October 1985), known by her stage name Marina and the Diamonds, is a Welsh singer-songwriter. Born in Brynmawr and raised in Pandy, she performed for choir productions in her childhood. In 2009, Diamandis came to prominence after being ranked in second place on the Sound of 2010 poll organized by BBC. Her debut studio album The Family Jewels (2010) incorporated indie pop and new wave musical styles, while her follow-up record Electra Heart (2012) integrated prominent elements of electropop. The latter project debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, and introduced Diamandis to several international markets. She has described herself as an "indie artist with pop goals", and often analyzes components of human behavior in her music. Diamandis is additionally recognized for her retro and cartoonish fashion styles.
"I created the name 'Marina and the Diamonds' 5 years ago and I never envisaged a character, pop project, band or solo artist. I saw a simple group made up of many people who had the same hearts. A space for people with similar ideals who could not fit in to life's pre-made mold. I was terribly awkward for a long time! I really craved to be part of one thing because I never felt too connected to anybody and now I feel I have that all around me."
Marina Lambrini Diamandis was born on 10 October 1985.[2] She has one older sister;[3] their mother is Welsh, while their father is Greek.[4] Diamandis was born in Brynmawr in Wales,[5] and was raised in the nearby village of Pandy.[3] She has been diagnosed with synesthesia, and consequently associates particular colours with musical notes and days of the week.[6] In her childhood, Diamandis attended Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls,[7] Her parents separated when she was 16 years old; she initially moved to Greece with her father, although returned to Wales two years later.[3] Diamandis first began writing music when she was 18 years old; she moved to London to attend dance school, but quit two months later.[8]
Diamandis later traveled for several unsuccessful auditions, including opportunities with the musical for The Lion King and a boy band organized by Virgin Records.[9][10] In 2005, she created the stage name "Marina and the Diamonds";[1] after coming to prominence, "the Diamonds" was established as a reference to her fans, instead of her backing band.[11] Diamandis self-composed and produced her earlier demos with GarageBand,[9] and independently released her debut extended play Mermaid vs. Sailor through Myspace in 2007.[12] She came to the attention of Neon Gold Records' Derek Davies in 2008, and was hired as the supporting act for Australian recording artist Gotye. In October, Diamandis finalized a recording contract with 679 Recordings (eventually renamed 679 Artists), a subdivision of Warner Music Group.[12]
Diamandis' debut single "Obsessions" was released on 14 February 2009 Neon Gold Records,[13] while her second extended play The Crown Jewels EP followed on 1 June.[14] That summer, she performed at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend,[15] the Glastonbury Festival,[16] and the Reading and Leeds Festivals.[17] In December 2009, Diamandis was ranked in second place on the Sound of 2010 poll organized by BBC, behind English singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding.[18] "Mowgli's Road" was released as the lead single from Diamandis' debut studio album on 13 November 2009.[19] It was followed by "Hollywood" on 1 February,[20] which reached number 12 on the UK Singles Chart.[21]
Diamandis' debut studio album The Family Jewels was released on 15 February 2010;[22] it debuted at number five on the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 27,618 copies,[23] and was eventually certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry.[24] Atlantic Records signed Diamandis to Chop Shop Records in the United States.[25] Through the label, she released her third extended play The American Jewels EP on 23 March,[26] and later released The Family Jewels in the United States on 25 May.[27] The latter project debuted at number 138 on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 24,000 copies.[28][29]
"I Am Not a Robot" was serviced as the third single from The Family Jewels on 26 April, after originally being included on The Crown Jewels. Diamandis commented that she decided to re-release the track because "people seem to empathize and relate with the song, regardless of gender or age."[30] The song peaked at number 26 on the UK Singles Chart.[21] "Oh No" followed as the fourth single from the record,[31] and reached number 38 in the United Kingdom.[21] The fifth and final single "Shampain" peaked at number 141 on the UK Singles Chart, consequently underperforming by comparison with its preceding singles.[32] To further promote The Family Jewels, Diamandis embarked on The Family Jewels Tour, which visited Europe and North America throughout 2010 and 2011.[33]
In summer 2011, Diamandis and Swedish recording artist Robyn performed as the opening acts for American recording artist Katy Perry during her California Dreams Tour.[34] On 30 September, Diamandis released the track "Radioactive" through the iTunes Store;[35] it peaked at number 25 on the UK Singles Chart.[21] Her second studio album was preceded by its lead single "Primadonna" on 20 March 2012 in the United States,[36] and was later made available in the United Kingdom on 6 April.[37] The song is notable for being Diamandis' highest-charting track on the UK Singles Chart, where it reached number 11.[21]
The final product Electra Heart is a concept album lyrically united by the ideas of "female identity" and "a recent breakup".[38] Diamandis created the titular character "Electra Heart" as a protagonist for the project; she portrays the personas "Teen Idle", "Primadonna", "Homewrecker", and "Su-Barbie-A", which represent several female archetypes of stereotypical American culture.[39] The project was released on 27 April 2012,[40] and debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 21,358 copies.[41] It became Diamandis' first chart-topping album in the United Kingdom,[42] although at the time it was additionally distinguished as the lowest-selling number-one record of the 21st century in the country.[41] The album was eventually certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry for exceeding shipments of 60,000 units.[43] Furthermore, it became Diamandis' highest-charting release in the United States, peaked at number 31 on the Billboard 200 upon its release in the country.[28]
"Power & Control" was released as the second single from Electra Heart on 20 July,[44] although it peaked at number 193 on the UK Singles Chart.[21] Later that month, it was announced that "How to Be a Heartbreaker" would be released as the second single in the United States and the third single in the United Kingdom. Diamandis commented that she had written the track while Electra Heart was being pressed in the United Kingdom, and consequently missed the cut-off for initial inclusion on the record; however, it was featured in the revised track listing for the American version.[45] It peaked at number 88 in the latter country.[21] Throughout 2012, Diamandis traveled for The Lonely Hearts Club Tour, her second headlining concert tour, and Mylo Xyloto Tour headlined by Coldplay, for which she served as an opening act.[46] On 8 August 2013, Diamandis released a music video for the previously-unreleased title track "Electra Heart";[47] it depicted the death of the character, and symbolically ended the promotional campaign for Electra Heart.[48]
After spending one month in New York City, Diamandis announced that she had begun writing material for her upcoming third studio album in February 2013.[49]
"[Daniel Johnston] really opened me up to a whole new world of music and a whole new perception of what an artist is. For me, he really encouraged me because if you think of someone who has been spoon-fed pop, up until 21 years old, and you hear someone like Daniel Johnston you're like 'God, this is terrible, but I love it.' It sounds like a child has made it, like, the production is so all over the place. He's obviously got something very captivating here yet he doesn't fit the normal mold and people still love him. I thought 'if he can do it then I can,' that's when I started to produce things myself and play live, even though I wasn't even great on the piano. It's all about emotion and if you have heart, and people connect to that, they see right through us."
A self-described "DIY musician" and "indie artist with pop goals",[50][51] Diamandis considers her music to be "alternate pop".[52] Whereas The Family Jewels incorporated prominent elements of new wave music,[53] Electra Heart was heavily inspired by electropop musical styles.[54] Diamandis opined that the United States was more welcoming of said musical transition than the United Kingdom, and suggested that the American audience embraced the humor behind the latter "tongue-in-cheek record".[55] She has jokingly stated that "I probably have a bit of a different sound because I don't really know what I'm doing!", referencing her lack of formal musical training.[56] Diamandis' lyrical content typically analyzes components of human behavior; she has noted that she would have become a psychologist had she been unsuccessful in the music industry.[57]
Diamandis' vocals have been compared to those of Karen O, Regina Spektor, Kate Bush, and Florence Welch.[56] When reviewing The Family Jewels, Joe Copplestone from PopMatters noted that her vocal delivery occasionally overpowers the "inventive" melodies showcased in her songs.[58] Paul Lester from The Guardian suggested that Diamandis' musical direction is "hard to fathom", given the frequency with which she alternates "simple keyboards-based ballads" and "quirky new wave-inflected numbers".[59] She has cited Brody Dalle and Britney Spears as her musical influences,[52][60] and has expressed a particular interest in Daniel Johnston and the lo-fi production he utilizes.[50]
Diamandis is notable for her "experimental" clothing;[61] she has described her fashion styles as "vintage, cheerleader and cartoon",[62] and has identified Sofia Loren and Gwen Stefani as her fashion icons.[63] As part of Selfridges' "Sound of Music", Diamandis designed her own window display for the London Oxford Street branch in May 2010,[64] and additionally appeared as a "live mannequin" for the display.[65] In November, she was featured on the website for the British version of Vogue, where she contributed to the "Today I'm Wearing" column that month.[66]
On August 11, 2013, Diamandis launched her own fashion line, 11 Diamonds. Her first line of T-Shirts were designed in collaboration with DEER DANA, Francisco Canton, and Yippy Whippy, and distributed by Diamandis' label, Neon Gold Records.[67]

Marina and the Diamonds, really just Marina Diamandis, was born in Wales to Welsh and Greek parents in 1986, although she has often claimed to be from Ancient Greece. After dropping out of four different music courses at four different universities, Marina decided to make her own way in music, and began writing her own unique brand of left-field pop songs under her new stage name. Early on, she claimed that her inspirations were Britney Spears and Gwen Stefani -- who she often covered at live gigs -- but her songs have a soulful edge pointing to a deeper source of influence.
Her piano/keyboard-driven songs vary from melancholic ballads to out-and-out glam-pop, but her unique voice and melodic style are omnipresent in her music. Essentially a solo artist, Marina wrote the bulk of her early material alone, arranging it for a band to ensure her live shows carried the full energy of her studio recordings. Quick to distance herself from comparisons to the rest of the female solo artists who broke through in 2009, Marina was also open about voicing her opinions on more established musical peers including Lily Allen and Kate Nash. In interviews she often showed a dislike of being grouped together with other emerging artists, especially when she had nothing in common with them except gender. The variety in her music made it hard to classify or pigeonhole, and comparisons were made with artists as diverse as Regina Spektor and Elvis Costello. The startling "cuckoo!" refrain of "Mowgli's Road" and the introspective balladry of "Obsessions" could not be more different, but it was the ever-present charm in Marina's music that brought her cult success in the early part of her career.
Her first single, "Obsessions/Mowgli's Road" was issued by indie label Neon Gold in the U.S., also home to electro-indie Americans Passion Pit, and was followed later in 2009 by The Crown Jewels EP, which contained three new songs, including an electronic remix of fan favorite "I Am Not a Robot." After playing the exhausting British festival circuit in the summer of 2009, Marina briefly retired to the studio to polish off her debut album, 2010's The Family Jewels, before quickly hitting the road again. The group's second, full-length studio outing, Electra Heart, was preceded by the singles " Primadonna" and "Radioactive", the latter of which appeared only on the deluxe version of the album. ~ Jack Semmence, Rovi

Marina Lambrini Diamandis (born 10 October 1985), better known as Marina and the Diamonds (sometimes stylised as Marina & the Diamonds), is a Welsh singer-songwriter. Her stage name, "Marina and the Diamonds", consists of Diamandis' first name and the translation of her surname which means "Diamonds" in Greek.
Although "The Diamonds" are often mistaken for her backing band, they in fact refer to Diamandis' fans: she explains this on her MySpace page by saying "I'm Marina. You are the diamonds."
Diamandis' musical style ranges from keyboard-based ballads to more up-tempo New Wave-style songs with full band backing. She has cited a wide-range of influences such as Daniel Johnston, Blondie, The Distillers, Patti Smith, Tom Waits, Nirvana, PJ Harvey, Kate Bush, Britney Spears, Yann Tiersen, Elliott Smith, Dolly Parton and Madonna.

Marina was born in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, Wales, as the youngest of two sisters to a Greek father and Welsh mother. She grew up in the village of Pandy and attended school at Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls, the school she accredits for allowing her to "find her talent there". Self-described as "the one who always skived off choir, but I had an incredible music teacher who managed to convince me I could do anything", Marina was musical from an early age.
However, her parents divorced when she was sixteen, and she moved to Greece to live with her father. She later returned to Wales when she was eighteen.
Marina moved to London at eighteen where she attended dance school for two months. Following this, in 2005 she took a one year singing course at Tech Music Schools. Diamandis enrolled in a music degree at the University of East London, transferring in her second year of studies to Middlesex University, but later dropped out. She went for many auditions including the West End musical, The Lion King. Diamandis admitted that she auditioned for a reggae boy band, held by Virgin Records, in 2005 to try to make it into the music business. She said she was "delusional with drive" and ultimately decided to dress up in male attire to try to amuse the record label to sign her, but she was unsuccessful. However, she was called back by the record label a week later.
In 2005, Diamandis created the name Marina and the Diamonds. When describing the origin of the name, she said:
I never envisaged a character, pop project, band or solo artist. I saw a simple group made up of many people who had the same hearts. A space for people with similar ideals who could not fit in to life's pre-made mould. I was terribly awkward for a long time! I really craved to be part of one thing because I never felt too connected to anybody and now I feel I have that all around me.—Marina Diamandis
Early demos of Marina's songs were self-composed and produced on the Apple software application GarageBand. Through Gumtree she found someone to produce a few tracks, for which she paid £500. These demo tracks are on her self-released debut EP Mermaid vs. Sailor which was released on 23 November 2007. The record was created on hand-made CD-Rs by Diamandis and sold through her MySpace page. An estimated seventy copies were sold overall.
In January 2008, Diamandis was first discovered by music scouter Derek Davies of Neon Gold Records. Davies booked Diamandis to open for Belgian-Australian singer Gotye later that year where Warner Music Group first saw her and ended up signing her in October 2008 to 679 Recordings.
Marina's debut single was a double A-side consisting of Obsessions and Mowgli's Road which was issued on Neon Gold Records in the United States on 19 November 2008.
Mowgli's Road was re-released as Marina and the Diamonds' debut album's lead single in November 2009. However, the song "Hollywood" was released as the first major single from the album in February 2010. The song performed relatively well, peaking at number twelve in the United Kingdom and charting in the top 20 in Europe. Marina's debut album, The Family Jewels, was released on 15 February 2010. It peaked at number five on the UK Albums Chart, selling over 27,500 copies in its first week, and was certified silver in the United Kingdom days before its release. Marina embarked on her first headlining tour on 14 February 2010 to coincide with the album release, which consisted of seventy dates around the United Kingdom, Ireland, mainland Europe, the United States and Canada. A re-release of I Am Not a Robot in April 2010 became the album's third single; Marina said she decided to re-release the song because "people seem to empathize and relate with the song, regardless of gender or age." The song peaked at number twenty-six on the UK Singles Chart. Oh No! was released as the album's fourth single on 2 August 2010, and the song peaked at number thirty-eight in the United Kingdom. Shampain was released as the album's fifth and final single in the UK and Ireland. The song was an underperformance, peaking at only number 141 in the UK.
In March 2010, Atlantic Records signed Marina and the Diamonds to Chop Shop Records in the United States. Before the album's American release in May 2010, Marina released her third extended play, The American Jewels EP, digitally and exclusively for the United States in March 2010. Marina made her North American debut on 14 March 2010 through a series of performances. The Family Jewels peaked at number 138 on the Billboard 200.
Marina and the Diamonds was nominated for Critics' Choice at the 2010 BRIT Awards and came fifth in SHREDnews' "Ten Artists To Watch in 2010" list in March 2010. She also won the award for Best UK & Ireland Act at the 2010 MTV Europe Music Awards.
For her second album, Marina recorded material with producers Cirkut, Guy Sigsworth, Labrinth, Greg Kurstin, Diplo, Dr. Luke, Stargate and Liam Howe. A promotional single, Radioactive produced by Stargate, was released in October 2011. The song reached number twenty-five in the UK. Marina posted a demo of the song Starring Role on YouTube in November, and a video titled ♡ PART 3: "THE ARCHETYPES" ♡ in December in which she introduced the Electra Heart character and the female archetypes she symbolises.
Electra Heart was released on 27 April 2012. The concept album made its debut at number one in both the United Kingdom and Ireland, making it her first album to do so. In the United Kingdom, the album sold over 21,000 copies in its first week. Electra Heart also charted in Europe and Australia, and it became her highest-charting album in the US, peaking at number thirty.The album was preceded by the single Primadonna produced by Dr. Luke and Cirkut. Primadonna became Marina's highest-peaking single in the UK to date, peaking at number eleven, and also became her most successful single internationally, being certified platinum in Ireland for sales exceeding 15,000 units and reaching number four on the New Zealand chart, as well as platinum status. Marina started her Lonely Hearts Club Tour in May 2012, which consisted of 108 shows and lasted for over a year. Power & Control served as the second single from the album in the United Kingdom, whilst How to Be a Heartbreaker (which features on the US edition of the album) was released as the second international single and the third UK single. The latter was covered on the US TV show Glee in the episode "Feud".
On Christmas Day 2012, Marina performed a cover version of the famous Christmas single Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. On 14 February 2013, a video titled ♡ PART 8: "EVOL" ♡ was uploaded to Marina's YouTube account, featuring the new song E.V.O.L, that was released for free download via SoundCloud hours later as a Valentine's Day gift from Diamandis to her fans. On 2 March 2013, Diamandis released a music video for the song "The State of Dreaming" from Electra Heart on her YouTube account.
On 17 April 2013, Marina tweeted "08.08.13" which led fans to believe that would be the date that would mark the death of the character Electra Heart as the music video for Fear and Loathing, which represented the birth of Electra, was published on 8 August 2011, exactly 2 years before the date mentioned in the tweet. Her Lonely Hearts Club Tour ended on 29 May 2013. On 1 May 2013, Marina released the song Just Desserts with Charli XCX and premiered it on her YouTube channel. The music video for the song Lies from Electra Heart was released in July 2013. On 8 August 2013, a video titled ♡ PART 11: "Electra Heart" ♡ was uploaded to her YouTube account, featuring the album's title track. This video was the final part of her series "The Archetypes" and saw the death of the fictional character Electra Heart, officially ending the Electra Heart era.
On 22 February 2013, Marina revealed to Billboard that she had begun writing songs for her third album whilst in New York City for a month-long stint.
Marina Diamandis is 5’4″ (162 cm), has naturally brown hair and brown eyes. In October 2011 she bleached her hair blond, but later dyed it back. During 2011-2012 she wore a blonde wig for 9 months after she lost a significant amount of hair in a hairdressing incident.
Marina and the Diamonds is also notable for her unique attire. When asked in an interview to describe her fashion style in three words, Marina said "vintage, cheerleader and cartoon".
Marina has started her own online clothing range, Eleven Diamonds, which launched in late July 2013 and is due to continue into 2014.
