=======================================================
Jamie Oliver is a phenomenon in the world of food. He is one of the world's best-loved television personalities and one of Britain's most famous exports. Jamie has had huge success with television series The Naked Chef (BBC), Jamie's Kitchen, Jamie's School Dinners, Jamie's Great Italian Escape, Return to School Dinners, Jamie's Chef, Jamie at Home , Jamie's Ministry of Food , Jamie Does.... and more recently Jamie's 30 Minute Meals and the Emmy Award-winning Jamie's Food Revolution (ABC),  as well as the one-off specials Jamie's Fowl Dinners, Eat To Save Your Life, Jamie Saves Our Bacon and Jamie's Fish Suppers (all for Channel 4). 
Jamie has inspired people to spend more time enjoying being in the kitchen  and even start growing their own food! His programmes have now been broadcast in over 100 countries including the USA, Australia, South Africa, Brazil, Japan and Iceland. Having been translated into over 30 languages, the accompanying cookbooks are bestsellers not only in the UK but across the world.  His 2010 book, Jamie's 30 Minute Meals, became Jamie's first million-selling book in the UK as well as being the fastest-selling non-fiction book since records began.
The high street restaurant collection 'Jamie's Italian' is hugely popular across the UK and the Fifteen restaurant group which he founded in 2002, provides training for young people in three locations around the world as well as producing food of the highest quality.  Jamie's newest restaurant, Barbecoa in London, is a partnership with American chef Adam Perry Lang.  Jamie lives in London and Essex with his wife, Jools and his kids, Poppy, Daisy, Petal and Buddy.
Born on 27 May 1975, Jamie took an early interest in food. He grew up in Essex, where his parents Trevor and Sally still run their own highly respected pub/restaurant The Cricketers in Clavering and was frequently found helping out in the kitchens. His fascination for food continued to grow and at 16 Jamie left school and completed his training at Westminster Catering College.  After spending some time working in France, followed by a stint at Antonio Carluccio's Neal Street Restaurant, London Jamie joined the acclaimed River Café where he worked for three and a half years alongside Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers.
In 1997, Jamie was featured in a television documentary about the River Café. Soon after the documentary was aired, Jamie was offered his own television show and The Naked Chef was born. The concept behind The Naked Chef was to strip food down to its bare essentials and Jamie's hands-on style and general laid back outlook was like a breath of fresh air, inspiring everyone to cook and winning himself a BAFTA Award for the best television series in the Features Category in 2000.
The Naked Chef book, published by Penguin Books accompanied the first television series and it became an instant bestseller. A second and then a third television series were commissioned by the BBC, along with the second and third tie-in books: The Return of the Naked Chef and Happy Days with the Naked Chef, with Happy Days with the Naked Chef becoming the official Christmas No.1 in 2001 in the non-fiction chart. 
Jamie spent the autumn of 2001 taking his cookery show on the road  the Happy Days Tour was a huge success with over 17,000 people packing theatres in the UK. The tour then took in Australia and New Zealand, where Jamie played to sold out crowds in seven cities.  He had become a global phenomenon.  2001 also saw Jamie cooking for the Italian Prime Minister at Tony Blair's invitation at Downing St and also writing various columns in magazines including GQ and The Saturday Times magazine, bringing his recipes to another eager audience. 
By the end of 2001 Jamie needed a new challenge; he wanted to 'give something back' to the catering industry, so he decided to open a training restaurant for young people who were not in full time education or employment. Followed by cameras that documented his every move he spent the year setting up a training scheme, the restaurant and the charity into which all the profits would be channelled. The series, Jamie's Kitchen, broadcast by Channel 4 in the UK, became one of the biggest hit shows of the year.  It has now been shown in over 40 countries and the tie-in book, also called Jamie's Kitchen, became a runaway success. The triumph of the restaurant was shown when it won Tatler Best Restaurant Award 2003, and the Academy Award of Excellence at the Tio Pepe Carlton London Restaurant Awards in the same year. Jamie was awarded an MBE in 2003 for his contribution to the hospitality industry. The Fifteen Foundation charity now owns Fifteen London and continues its work, recently recruiting the eighth year of students for training in London. The first Fifteen franchise opened in Amsterdam in 2004 and subsequent Fifteens have opened in Cornwall, UK and Melbourne, Australia in 2006.
In 2004, motivated by the poor state of school dinners in UK schools, Jamie embarked on one of his most ambitious ventures to date. He went back to school with the aim of educating and motivating the kids and dinner ladies to enjoy cooking and eating healthy, nutritious lunches rather than the processed foods that they were used to. Jamie launched a national campaign called Feed Me Better (www.feedmebetter.com) and launched an online petition for better school meals.  As a result of the 271,677 signatures on the petition, which Jamie took to 10 Downing Street on 30th March 2005, the government pledged an extra £280 million to improve the standard of school meals, to provide training for dinner ladies and equipment for schools.  Over seven months of hard work and constant filming culminated in the award-winning series Jamie's School Dinners, shown on Channel 4. The series prompted a public outcry for change to the school meals system and was awarded Best Factual programme at the UK National TV Awards. Jamie also received a special award for his contribution to television at the National TV awards.
A follow-up documentary, Jamie's Return To School Dinners aired on Channel 4 in September 2006 and as a result of Jamie's new findings the British government made further investment in school meals and food education for school children.
Between these two documentaries, in 2005, Jamie took a break from schools with Jamie's Great Italian Escape, a series based on his travels around Italy and his love of Italian food. This was accompanied by Jamie's sixth book, Jamie's Italy which instantly went to number one in the UK and sold more copies in the week before Christmas than any other non-fiction book has ever done.  The book was also nominated for the British Book Award 'Book of the Year' in the UK. 
In addition to Jamie's television programmes and books, Jamie works with top UK supermarket chain, Sainsbury's, advising them on how to further improve the quality and variety of supermarket food.  He has also designed a number of ranges of quality tableware and serveware with Churchill China.  Working with Tefal (T-Fal), Jamie has launched a number of ranges of cookware including the Jamie Oliver Professional Series. Jamie has also launched an Italian food range and has a wide range of gift foods, which are distributed internationally.  Jamie has also turned inventor and developed a great kitchen gadget called the Flavour ShakerTM, which launched in the UK in 2005 and then internationally. 
Jamie's seventh book, Cook With Jamie was published in the UK in October 2006 and quickly became a massive best-seller.  All of Jamie's profits from this book go to the Fifteen Foundation to help more young people to start a career in the catering industry.
Through 2006 and early 2007, Jamie filmed a series and wrote a book both called 'Jamie At Home'.  He had been successfully growing fruit and vegetables and herbs at his Essex farmhouse since 2004 and the book and series reflected his new love of gardening organically as well as featuring delicious recipes inspired by the produce of his garden.  The series 'Jamie At Home' quickly became a hit in the UK and in a variety of international markets while the accompanying book 'Jamie At Home' also proved to be one of Jamie's biggest sellers both in the UK and overseas.
In autumn 2007 Jamie announced a new chain of "high street" Italian restaurants called 'Jamie's Italian', the first of which opened in Oxford in May 2008.  Restaurants in Bath (Oct 08) and Kingston (Nov 08) followed  that first year and subsequent Jamie's Italians have proven to be firm favourites with the people of Brighton, Cardiff, Guildford, London's Canary Wharf, Cambridge, Reading, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, London (three restaurants), Birmingham, Nottingham and Bristol  www.jamiesitalian.com for more info.  Jamie's Italian also has a restaurant in Dubai.
Jamie began 2008 with a burst of activity fronting two major TV programmes in the UK. Eat To Save Your Life used expert analysis as well as an autopsy by Dr Gunther von Hagens on a 25-stone man who literally "ate himself to death" to try to change the dietary habits of a group of malnourished Brits.  Meanwhile Jamie's Fowl Dinners was an in-depth and challenging look at the British poultry industry with a message that unless British consumers were prepared to trade up to a higher welfare chicken and egg, the British poultry industry would suffer irreparably.  Groups ranging from the RSPCA to farmers' organisations praised the programme and the immediate result was an increase in sales of free-range and organic chicken of up to 50%.
In 2008, Jamie as usual worked on a number of exciting projects including appearing in The Big Give, the prime-time Oprah Winfrey-fronted hit show on ABC in the States which aired in the spring.   
Jamie's major project for 2008, however, was Jamie's Ministry of Food, a Channel 4 TV series which showed how people who couldn't cook could be inspired to cook with just a little encouragement and information.  The series, filmed in Rotherham, explored how friends, family and work-mates could be inspired to pass on recipes to each other and cook using fresh ingredients.  Additionally, a Ministry of Food centre set-up by Jamie in the town centre has been providing information, cooking lessons and advice to the townsfolk who want to move away from take-aways and ready-meals.  After the success of the Ministry of Food centre, Rotherham Council announced it would continue to fund the running of the centre and in 2010, the Rotherham Ministry of Food centre is so successful that its classes are booked many weeks in advance.  A second Ministry centre opened in Bradford in November 2009 and a third in Leeds in April 2010.   Many other UK councils are seriously looking at opening similar centres to try to halt Britain's growing obesity problem.
A book, Jamie's Ministry of Food was published by Michael Joseph in October 2008 and quickly became one of Jamie's most successful books both in the UK and internationally.
In early 2009, Jamie was typically busy.  On television he tackled the issue of pig welfare and the need to champion British pig farmers in the Channel 4 one-off programme Jamie Saves Our Bacon.  He also announced a new high street cooking shop project called Recipease, the first of which opened in Battersea/Clapham Junction in February quickly followed by a second shop in Brighton in May.   
The year also saw the launch of Jamie at Home, an exciting direct selling business which empowers people to start their own businesses by selling Jamie's quality products through holding parties for friends and colleagues.  For more info  www.jamieathome.com 
On April 1st, Jamie had the great honour of cooking at 10 Downing Street for the third time in his career, this time for the assembled world leaders in advance of the G20 talks.  He and a group of graduates and an apprentice from Fifteen London cooked a menu showing off the best of seasonal British food.  Just over 24 hours later, Jamie was celebrating the birth of his third daughter  Petal Blossom Rainbow.
Jamie spent much of 2009 in the USA, first making a series for Channel 4 (and overseas markets), Jamie's American Road Trip, during which he visited Los Angeles (meeting Mexican ex-gang members who are being rehabilitated through food and cooking), Wyoming (where he spent time with cowboys living in a wilderness that has barely changed for centuries), New York (where he strayed from the typical tourist areas to discover delicious food from the Peruvian, Colombian, Egyptian and Chinese communities), Louisiana (hunting alligators and helping to get a restaurant damaged by a hurricane back on its feet), Georgia (investigating soul food and the southern of barbecuing) and Arizona (where Jamie spent time with the Navajo people and learnt about their food and culture).  An accompanying book, Jamie's America, became Jamie's 10th best-seller.
Late in 2009, Jamie launched an iPhone app called 20 Minute Meals which quickly became a best-seller and a huge hit with the app-loving public in the UK and overseas as well as winning the much coveted Apple Design Award for apps.
Later that year, he returned to America, this time to West Virginia, to start his first major network series for America television.  "Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution" premiered on ABC in America in March 2010, winning its slot each week with ratings peaking at 7.5 million. Jamie appeared on Oprah to launch the campaign and also carried out high profile interviews on Letterman, Leno and Nightline as well as press interviews in The New York Times and TIME magazine.   Jamie became the recipient of the prestigious TED award for 2010 (previous winners have included Al Gore and Bono) at a ceremony in California. http://www.ted.com/talks/jamie_oliver.html and in August 2010 the Food Revolution series received an Emmy Award for Best Reality Series.
If that wasn't enough, back in the UK Jamie launched a new book and TV series: Jamie Does early in 2010 which saw Jamie seeking out fresh inspiration from countries he visited on cheap short hall flights from the UK, to discover authentic recipes and flavours. 
Autumn 2010 saw Jamie's first foray in UK "daytime television" with the launch of 30 Minute Meals, a daily TV series at 5.30pm in the UK which aimed to show cooks of all levels that by simply using their kitchen kit cleverly, they could get not just one dish but a whole meal on the table in half an hour.  The accompanying book, "Jamie's 30 Minute Meals" became Jamie's best- selling book to date and the fastest selling book of all time in the UK, passing the one million mark just before Christmas 2010.
On November 3rd, Jamie and renowned American chef Adam Perry Lang opened Barbecoa restaurant at the One New Change development next to St Paul's Cathedral.  The restaurant specialises in traditional cooking methods using wood, charcoal and smoke  www.barbecoa.com for more info.
Early in 2011, Jamie and his family upped-sticks and moved to California for two months where Jamie filmed the second series of 'Jamie's Food revolution' for ABC.

=======================================================
James Trevor "Jamie" Oliver MBE FRCGP (Hon) (born 27 May 1975) is an English celebrity chef, restaurateur, media personality, known for his food-focused television shows, cookbooks and more recently his global campaign for better food education. Known in the early days of his career as "The Naked Chef" (after the title of his first TV series), he strives to improve unhealthy diets and poor cooking habits in the United Kingdom and internationally. Jamie's belief is that if people have a greater knowledge of fresh food and cooking then not only can they feed themselves better but also are more likely to be able to recognise what's a treat food-wise and what's for every day.
Jamie Oliver was born and brought up in a village Clavering, Essex in England. His parents ran - and still run - a pub/restaurant, "The Cricketers", where Jamie used to practice cooking in the kitchen.[1] He was educated at Newport Free Grammar School. In 2009 Oliver stated that he was of partial Sudanese ancestry via his great-great grandfather John, whom he described as "a bit swarthy".[2] However, research for the Sunday Express established that John's father Peter was a hatter from Penzance, and that James' father Richard was also Cornish, leaving little or no possibility of a Sudanese connection. The family legend of Sudanese ancestry may have originated in the 19th century when John Oliver returned from sea, possibly with a tanned complexion after visiting Africa.[3]
Oliver left school at age sixteen with two GCSE qualifications in Art and Geology.[4] and went on to attend Westminster Kingsway College, formerly Westminster College.[1][5] He then earned a City & Guilds National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) in home economics.
His first job was a pastry chef at Antonio Carluccio's Neal's Yard restaurant, where he first gained experience with preparing Italian cuisine, and developed a relationship with his mentor Gennaro Contaldo. Later in his career, Oliver employed Contaldo to help run his successful collection of high street restaurants, Jamie's Italian. [5] Oliver then moved to The River Café, Fulham, as a sous chef.
It was there that he was noticed by the BBC in 1997 after making an unscripted appearance in a documentary about the restaurant, "Christmas at the River Cafe".[6] That year, his show The Naked Chef debuted and his cookbook became a number one best-seller in the UK.[7] That same year, Oliver was invited to prepare lunch for the Prime Minister of that time, Tony Blair at No. 10 Downing Street.[7]
In 2000, Oliver became the face of the UK supermarket chain Sainsbury's through an endorsement deal worth $2 million a year.[7] After 11 years the partnership between Oliver & Sainsbury's ended amicably. The final television advertisement was for Christmas 2011.[8]
After three series of Naked Chef programmes (The Naked Chef, Return of the Naked Chef and Happy Days with The Naked Chef) for the BBC, Oliver moved to Channel 4 in the UK where his first series was a documentary, Jamie's Kitchen which followed the setting up of Fifteen restaurant in London. The restaurant, in Westland Place, London, continues to train young adults who have a disadvantaged background for careers in the restaurant business.[9]. Many graduates of the Fifteen Apprenticeship Programme have gone on to become successful chefs, for example Tim Siadatan, head chef/co-owner at Trullo in North London.
In 2005, he initiated a campaign originally called "Feed Me Better" in order to move British schoolchildren towards eating healthy foods and cutting out junk food. As a result, the British government also pledged to address the issue. Delving into politics to push for changes in nutrition resulted in people voting him as the "Most Inspiring Political Figure of 2005," according to a Channel 4 News annual viewer poll.[7]
His emphasis on cooking fresh, nutritious food continued as he created Jamie's Ministry of Food, a television series where Oliver travelled to inspire everyday people in Rotherham, Yorkshire, to cook healthy meals. Another television series is Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution (2010–2011), where he travelled first to Huntington, West Virginia and then to Los Angeles to change the way Americans eat, and address their dependence on fast food.[7]
In 2007 threats against Jamie Oliver's charitable "15 Cornwall" were made by Cornish nationalists.[11]
Oliver's holding company, Sweet As Candy, has made enough profit for Oliver to have been listed on The Sunday Times list of richest Britons under 30.[12][13]
In June 2008 he launched a restaurant called Jamie's Italian, his first high-street business venture, in Oxford, England.[14] Jamie's Italian has proved successful and there are now 35 restaurants in the collection.[15] There are also Jamie's Italians in Ireland, Australia, Dubai, Russia and Singapore.
In January 2013, Oliver started the Food Tube digital TV platform as a means to promote new cooking talent. In June 2014, three of the stars of Food Tube - DJ BBQ, KerryAnn Dunlop (one of the original Fifteen apprentices from 2002) and Cupcake Jemma - published their own cookery books through publisher Penguin Books.
From 2000, Oliver was the public face of the Sainsbury's supermarket chain in the UK, appearing on television and radio advertisements and in-store promotional material. The deal earned him an estimated £1.2 million every year.[18] By 2004, the company had made 65 advertisements with him, but this arrangement has not been without controversy. Oliver was reported to have admitted that he does not use supermarkets, saying “For any chef, supermarkets are like a factory. I buy from specialist growers, organic suppliers and farmers".[19] He was also said to have been criticised by Sainsbury's CEO Justin King when he slammed the "junk" sold by supermarkets that ends up in the lunchboxes of millions of children. King reportedly hit back, saying: "Dictating to people—or unleashing an expletive-filled tirade—is not the way to get engagement."[20]
Oliver also has a line of non-stick pans and cookware for Tefal and has appeared in Australian television commercials for Yalumba wines, using Del Boy's catchphrase of "Lovely Jubbly".[21]
In August 2013, Oliver and Canadian supermarket chain Sobeys announced a partnership in improving nation-wide nutrition and advertising campaigns.[22]
Oliver's first series. The title was a reference to the simplicity of Oliver's recipes and has nothing to do with nudity. Oliver has frequently admitted that he was not entirely happy with the title, which was devised by producer Patricia Llewellyn.
In the UK edit of the show, the opening titles include a clip of him telling an unseen questioner, "No way! It's not me, it's the food!"
The success of the programme led to the books Return of the Naked Chef (2002) and Happy Days with the Naked Chef (2002).
A five-part 2002 documentary series. It followed Oliver as he attempted to train a group of disadvantaged youths, who would, if they completed the course, be offered jobs at Oliver's new restaurant "Fifteen".
A four-part documentary series. Oliver took responsibility for running the kitchen meals in Kidbrooke School, Greenwich, for a year. Disgusted by the unhealthy food being served to schoolchildren and the lack of healthy alternatives on offer, Oliver began a campaign to improve the standard of Britain’s school meals. Public awareness was raised and subsequently the British Government pledged to spend £280m on school dinners (spread over three years). Tony Blair acknowledged that this was a result of Oliver's campaign. Following the success of the campaign, Oliver was named "Most Inspiring Political Figure of 2005" in the Channel 4 Political Awards 2006. In episode 2 of Jamie's School Dinners, Oliver's Fifteen London restaurant was visited by former US President Bill Clinton. Clinton asked to see Oliver; however, Oliver refused: 36 showed up for a booking of 20 and many of them were on a South Beach Diet and refused the special menu that had been prepared, even though it had been approved in advance.[23]
A six-part travelogue series, was first broadcast on Channel 4 in Britain in October 2005. It follows Oliver as he travels around Italy in a blue VW van (plus a trailer for cooking). He is about to turn 30 and this is his personal adventure to rediscover his love of cooking.[24]
A four-part series continuing where Jamie's Kitchen left off. Five years and fifty trainees later, Oliver's most recent series aims to help the winning trainee establish their own restaurant at The Cock, a pub near Braintree, Essex. The charitable Fifteen Foundation retains ownership of the property and has provided a £125,000 loan for the winner, Aaron Craze, to refurbish the establishment. As of 13 January 2008, the Cock has closed down and reopened as a regular pub.[25][26]
Featured Oliver presenting home-style recipes and gardening tips, with many ingredients coming from his substantial home garden. Jamie at Home airs on the Food Network in the United States.

Oliver was ultimately barred from filming at any Los Angeles public school. The show's cancellation was announced by ABC in May 2011, two weeks before the final episode of the season had aired.[36] The program also aired in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 under the title Jamie's American Food Revolution,Australia on Channel 10 under the original title, and in Malaysia on TLC channel (Astro Channel 707) under the original title.

In 2012, Oliver appeared during Week 6 of the series on MasterChef Australia as the celebrity chef in the show's Immunity Challenge 5. Showcasing his skills, Oliver's board plate scored higher than the three contestants he was up against (all three judges scored Oliver a 9/10), thus preventing them from earning an Immunity Pin.
The Happy Days Live tour was Oliver's first live show in 2001 and included several dates in the UK and Australasia.[42] Performing to sold-out venues, he cooked on stage and interacted with the audiences with competitions, music and special effects only usually seen in pop concerts.[43] He took the audiences by surprise by singing and drumming to a song called Lamb Curry written by his longtime friend Leigh Haggerwood. Oliver appears at the BBC Good Food show each year and took to the road once more in 2006 on an Australian tour where he performed in Sydney and Melbourne. Following the entertaining format of his first live show, the 2006 Australian tour featuring special guests including mentor Gennaro Contaldo, and students from Fifteen London. Oliver also performed a new song written by Leigh Haggerwood called Fish Stew which Oliver cooked to and also drummed along to at the end of the show. The shows were considered by some to be a great success and are featured in a one-off TV documentary called Jamie Oliver: Australian Diary.[44]
In 2005, Oliver was widely criticised by animal rights groups for slaughtering a fully conscious lamb on his TV show, while PETA praised Oliver for showing the killing uncensored, claiming that it highlighted problems with the methods used within slaughterhouses for viewers at home.[45] PETA spokesman Sean Gifford said that it "could turn the more diehard carnivore into a vegetarian".[45] British TV regulator Ofcom reported they had seven complaints from the public.[45]
Oliver has been known for his comments about other chefs and has spoken out against Marco Pierre White, who has been critical of Oliver in the past, and the notorious swearing of Gordon Ramsay.[46]
In 2005, Oliver embarked upon his school dinners campaign to improve the quality of food fed to pupils. While the campaign was arguably successful,[47] at the time it was a highly controversial shake-up for students and parents, some of whom believed that the students should have a healthy option available, but still be given the choice as to what they want to eat. In September 2006, Rawmarsh Community School, South Yorkshire, made headlines after a handful of parents revolted against Oliver's lunch plan (in which all 1,100 pupils on site were fed two portions of fruit and three vegetables every day) by delivering junk food from local shops to the pupils through the school fence. One parent dismissed Oliver's food as "disgusting rubbish" and declared, "Food is cheaper and better at the local takeaways".[48]
In 2011, Oliver, an advocate of cooking meals from scratch and using local produce, caused controversy after it turned out the sauces used in Jamie's Italian in Glasgow were from an industrial park almost 400 miles away in Bicester.[49] That same year, Oliver came under fire for lack of food safety protections in his restaurants and illnesses associated with under-cooking mince meat that may have been contaminated with E. coli.[50]
In 2014 Oliver's central London butchery Barbecoa was forced to temporarily close after hygiene inspectors gave it the second lowest rating. The Times reported they had found mouse droppings, mouldy carcasses and out-of-date meat. [51][52]
Oliver and Gordon Ramsay are spokeschefs for the "Big Fish Fight", which campaigns for sustainable seafood, but were criticised for their use of endangered fish.[53]
Oliver conceived and established the Fifteen charity restaurant, where he trained fifteen disadvantaged young people to work in the hospitality industry. Following the success of the original restaurant in London, more Fifteens have opened around the globe: Fifteen Amsterdam opened in December 2004, Fifteen Cornwall in Newquay in May 2006 and Fifteen Melbourne in September 2006 with Australian friend and fellow chef Tobie Puttock.[54]
Oliver then began a formal campaign to ban unhealthy food in British schools and to get children eating nutritious food instead. Oliver's efforts to bring radical change to the school meals system, chronicled in the series Jamie's School Dinners, challenged the junk-food culture by showing schools they could serve healthy, cost-efficient meals that kids enjoyed eating.[55] Jamie's efforts brought the subject of school dinners to the political forefront and changed the types of food served in schools.[56] In 2012, after supporting Scottish primary school blogger Martha Payne in her NeverSeconds blog,[57] Oliver attacked education secretary Michael Gove for failing to adhere to the standards agreed to by the previous administration.
In December 2009, Oliver was awarded the 2010 TED Prize for his campaigns to "create change on both the individual and governmental levels" in order to "bring attention to the changes that the English, and now Americans, need to make in their lifestyles and diet."[16]
In 2010, Oliver joined several other celebrity chefs on the series The Big Fish Fight, in which Oliver and fellow chef Gordon Ramsay spend time on a trawler boat to raise awareness about the discarding of hundreds of thousands of saltwater fish because the fishermen are prohibited from keeping any fish other than the stated target of the trawl.[58]
In June 2003, Oliver was awarded the MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours. A proponent of fresh organic foods, Oliver was named the most influential person in the UK hospitality industry when he topped the inaugural Caterersearch.com 100 in May 2005.[60] The list placed Oliver higher than Sir Francis Mackay, the then-chairman of the contract catering giant Compass Group, which Oliver had soundly criticised in Jamie's School Dinners. In 2006, Oliver dropped to second on the list behind fellow celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay.[61] In July 2010, Jamie regained the top spot and has been named as the most powerful and influential person in the UK hospitality industry once again.[62]
In 2012, Oliver was honored by Harvard School of Public Health with the Healthy Cup Award for his substantial achievements in working to end the childhood obesity epidemic and in recognition of his campaigning to provide schoolchildren in the U.S. and U.K. with whole, freshly cooked food and inspiring millions of people around the world to become passionate about preparing delicious meals from scratch.The Healthy Cup Award is presented by Harvard School of Public Health’s Nutrition Round Table, a group that helps to bridge the gap between scientific advances and sustainable changes in food policy, practices, and products, with a focus on obesity, healthy lifestyles, global nutrition, and chronic diseases. Members include scientific experts, business leaders, restaurateurs, health educators and health care providers, writers, doctors, philanthropists, and concerned citizens.
In 2013 Oliver was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by the Royal College of General Practitioners for his work in tackling childhood obesity by improving the nutritional value of school dinners.[63]
Oliver is mentioned in the South Park episode "Medicinal Fried Chicken". He is also featured in the later episode "Crème Fraiche", in which he tearfully tries to convince celebrity chef Bobby Flay that kids' food should be healthy.[64]
He was a guest on Epic Meal Time, a YouTube Channel specializing in Epic Meals (dishes that contain bacon, are physically very large, and contain intentionally high amounts of calories and fat).
He appears in an episode of Phineas and Ferb, in the episode "Meatloaf Surprise" where he is a judge in a meatloaf cooking contest.
In July 2000, Oliver married Juliette Norton.[65] The couple met in 1993 and have four children: Poppy Honey Rosie Oliver (born 18 March 2002), Daisy Boo Pamela Oliver (born on 10 April 2003), Petal Blossom Rainbow Oliver (born on 3 April 2009)[66] and Buddy Bear Oliver (born on 15 September 2010).[67] Oliver announced the births of the two youngest children on Twitter.[68][69] The family lives in Clavering, Essex.[70]

Childhood:Jamie Trevor Oliver was born May 27, 1975 in Clavering, Essex, England.  Jamie grew up in Cambridge where his parents, Trevor and Sally, own a pub and restaurant called The Cricketers (still in business).  When he was 8 years old, Jamie began working in his parent's restaurant.  At age 11 Jamie could cut vegetables as well as any of the kitchen staff.  In 1989, at the age of 14, Jamie formed the band Scarlet Division with composer/musician Leigh Haggerwood. Culinary Career:Jamie began attending the Westminster Catering College at the age of 16.  Later, he worked in France learning as much as he could before returning to London.  His first job back was working for Antonio Carluccio as Head Pastry Chef at The Neal Street Restaurant (CLOSED) (one of the best Italian restaurants in England).Here Jamie worked alongside Gennaro Contaldo, who Jamie considers one of his mentors.  After The Neal Street Restaurant, Jamie worked 3 1/2 years at the famous River Cafe in London.  It was here, Jamie says, where he learned "all about the time and effort that goes into creating the freshest, most honest, totally delicious food."The Television Star:The River Cafe was also his big break into television.  The day after appearing in a documentary about the restaurant called Christmas at the River Cafe, five television production companies contacted Jamie about starring in his own show.  He accepted an offer from Optomen Television to produce his first show  The Naked Chef.  The title is a reference to the simplicity of his recipes.  Two seasons of the show, which also aired in the U.S., were filmed in 1998 and 1999.  Jamie's Kitchen was Oliver's second television series.  The show, produced by Channel 4, is a documentary that follows Jamie as he mentors 15 unemployed youths (1000 applied for the position).  Jamie trains the youngsters to be professional chefs and help staff his first restaurant, Fifteen, a not-for-profit endeavor.  The restaurant is still open for business and on its third class of students.Later, Jamie would film another charitable project, Jamie's School Dinners.  This four part series documents Jamie as he takes responsibility of running the kitchen at Kidbrooke School, Greenwich.   It also showcases the Feed Me Better campaign, his crusade to change the poor eating habits of children and improve school meal systems.  The campaign was directly responsible for the British government's pledge of 280 million pounds (over 3 years) to improve school dinners.Jamie's latest series (2002-present), Oliver's Twist, appears on the Food Network.  The show follows Jamie as he shops for the best food in London and takes it home to cook for his friends.  In 2005, Jamie's Great Escape premiered.  The show is a travelogue of Jamie's trek across Italy (in a camper van) as he tries to rediscover his joy of cooking.The Prolific Writer:Aside from his many cookbooks, Jamie has a regular column in the Saturday Times Magazine, is a monthly editor of Marie Claire (UK), and is the food editor for Britain's GQ magazine.The Good British Citizen:In 1999, Jamie and his staff of 15 students were invited to 10 Downing Street to prepare lunch for the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who was entertaining the Italian Prime Minister. In June 2003, Jaimie was awarded an MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) in the Queen's Birthday Honours List for services to the Hospitality Industry.
On June 24, 2000 Jamie married his childhood sweetheart, Juliette (Jools) Norton.  They have two daughters, Poppy Honey (born March 2002) and Daisy Boo (born April 2003).

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Jamie Oliver's cheeky manner, constant use of the word 'pukka', and down to earth personality have won him legions of fans around the world. He has sold millions of cookery books, opened a restaurant, starred in several TV shows and revolutionised UK school dinners.He was born May 27th, 1975 and brought up in Clavering, Essex, where his parents, Trevor and Sally, ran a pub called 'The Cricketers'. It was there that the young Jamie began to cut his teeth as a chef and would practice daily in the kitchen and by the time he was 11, the young protégé could cut vegetables as well as any of the kitchen staff. He later attended Newport Free Grammar School and left at age sixteen with two GCSE qualifications going on to attend Westminster Kingsway College, formerly Westminster College. He then earned a City & Guilds NVQ in home economics.His first foray into the cheffing industry was as a pastry chef at Antonio Carluccio's Neal's Yard restaurant, where he first gained experience with preparing Italian cuisine, and developed a relationship with his 'mentor' Gennaro Contaldo. Oliver then moved to The River Café, Fulham, as a sous chef.Also around this time he began attending the Westminster Catering College at the age of 16. Later, he worked in France, immersing himself in the culture and learning as much as he could before returning to London. His first job back was working for Antonio Carluccio as Head Pastry Chef at The Neal Street Restaurant.Here Jamie worked alongside Gennaro Contaldo (of 'Two Greedy Italians' fame), who Jamie considers one of his mentors. After The Neal Street Restaurant, Jamie worked 3 1/2 years at the famous River Cafe in London, a position that would change his life forever. It was here, Jamie says, where he learned "all about the time and effort that goes into creating the freshest, most honest, totally delicious food." Not only that, it was also during his time at the River Cafe that he was noticed by the BBC in 1997 after making an unscripted appearance in a documentary about the restaurant, "Christmas at the River Cafe". That year, his show The Naked Chef debuted and his cookbook became a number one best-seller in the UK. That same year, Oliver was invited to prepare lunch for then Prime Minister Tony Blair at No. 10 Downing Street!In July 2000, Oliver married former model Juliette Norton. The couple met in 1993 and have four children: Poppy Honey Rosie Oliver (born 18 March 2002), Daisy Boo Pamela Oliver (born on 10 April 2003), Petal Blossom Rainbow Oliver (born on 3 April 2009) and Buddy Bear Maurice Oliver (born on 15 September 2010).In 2000, Oliver became the face of the UK supermarket chain Sainsbury's through an endorsement deal worth $2 million a year. After 11 years the partnership between Oliver & Sainsbury's ended. The final television advertisement was for Christmas 2011.Oliver created Fifteen in 2002. Each year, fifteen young adults who have a disadvantaged background, criminal record or history of drug abuse, are trained in the restaurant business. Oliver conceived and established the Fifteen charity restaurant where he trained fifteen disadvantaged young people to work in the hospitality industry. Following the success of the original restaurant in London, more Fifteens have opened around the globe: Fifteen Amsterdam opened in December 2004, Fifteen Cornwall in Newquay opened in May 2006 and Fifteen Melbourne opened in September 2006 with Australian friend and fellow chef Tobie Puttock.In 2005, he initiated a campaign called "Feed Me Better" in order to move British schoolchildren towards eating healthy foods and cutting out junk food. As a result, the British government also pledged to address the issue. Delving into politics to push for changes in nutrition resulted in people voting him as the "Most Inspiring Political Figure of 2005," according to a Channel 4 News annual viewer poll.Oliver then began a formal campaign to ban unhealthy food in British schools and to get children eating nutritious food instead. Oliver's efforts to bring radical change to the school meals system, chronicled in the series Jamie's School Dinners, challenged the junk-food culture by showing schools they could serve healthy, cost-efficient meals that kids enjoyed eating.Jamie is represented in London, England by Useful Talent.
      He is currently food editor for British GQ magazine and has a regular column with the Saturday Times Magazine.
      Also wrote a book "The Naked Chef" to accompany the series. Published by Penguin, it was number one on the bestseller list for more than 10 weeks.
      When he turned 16, he attended Westminster Catering College, where he completed his formal training.
      In 1999, Jamie was invited to 10 Downing Street to prepare a lunch for the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who was entertaining the Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema.
      He also plays drums with his high school mates in a band called Scarlet Division. According to Jamie, they sound like a mixture of "Catatonia and Texas with a harder edge."
      His parents own and operate a successful pub/restaurant "The Cricketers" in Cambridge, where he grew up.
      Children, with wife Juliet Oliver (Jools): Poppy Honey Oliver (b. March 18, 2002 at 7 lbs 14 oz, 4 days late), Daisy Boo Oliver (b. April 10, 2003), Petal Blossom Rainbow Oliver (b. April 3, 2009 at 6 lbs 10 oz) and Buddy Bear Maurice (b. September 15, 2010).
      He was awarded the MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2003 Queen's Birthday Honours List for his services to the Hospitality Industry.
      His hard work and promotion on his program "Jamie's School Dinners" has come to the attention of Prime Minister Tony Blair. The two have recently met and talked about new incentives for Labour to back the bid for healthy eating in schools.
      He and his wife, Juliet Oliver, are expecting their fourth child, due in September, 2010 [March 4, 2010].
      On being awarded the MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) I'm very pleased - this is terrific..Does that mean I don't get any more parking tickets? No, seriously, I'm very honoured.
=======================================================
By the time he was 31, Jamie Oliver had sold millions of cookery books, conquered the US market, opened a restaurant, starred in several TV shows and revolutionised UK school dinners.
Responsible for making cooking cool, the energetic man, whose cookbooks are bestsellers worldwide, has been voted the sexiest chef on television and his cookery shows are broadcast in over 50 countries. He is the self-proclaimed ambassador for British cooking whose diners include former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Prince Charles.
Born in 1975, Jamie developed his fascination for all things food at his parents’ restaurant in Essex. After leaving school he attended the Westminster Catering College, before travelling to France to further his skills. On his return he landed the job of head pastry chef for Antonio Carluccio at The Neal Street Restaurant.
Jamie’s next move was to the River Café, where he stayed for three and a half years, fine-tuning his skills under the guidance of Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers.
Spotted in the background of a documentary about the restaurant, it wasn’t long before the editors of the show focused in more and more on this cheeky young chef. The day after the programme was broadcast, Jamie received calls from five different production companies all eager to work with him. He soon became the hottest celebrity chef on the circuit and his programme, ‘The Naked Chef', revolutionised TV cooking shows - even though he was fully clothed!
His cheeky manner and down to earth personality have won him legions of fans around the world. Indeed, he is responsible for re-introducing the word ‘pukka' to the wider world.
Jamie is also a chef that likes to take risks - he set up ‘Fifteen Foundation', a charity which trains unemployed young adults to become professional chefs, and gambled over a million pounds of his own money on its success. The accompanying TV series and book were both huge successes.
His efforts to improve school meals saw him take on the British Government as well as the unenviable task of convincing schoolchildren to give up fast food. Again, the success of Jamie’s mission was huge and major steps were taken to improve the quality and variety of food on offer in schools.
Jamie's energy and lovable character made him advertising gold for Sainsbury's, which signed an endorsement deal worth £2 million a year with the chef in 2000, making him the face of the supermarket. Over the years, he has appeared in numerous campaigns urging the nation to eat healthy by taking advantage of the chain's grocery and food options.
The same year also saw the chef marry former model Juliette Norton who he had met in 1993. The couple started a family in March 2002 with the birth of Poppy Honey Oliver, who was joined in April the next year by Daisy Boo Oliver. After nearly six years, the couple expanded their brood with Petal Blossom Rainbow Oliver, who was born in April 2009, and Buddy Bear Maurice Oliver, who was welcomed into the family in September 2010.
Jamie's career as an author received a boost in 2010 when it was revealed that he had reached a new milestone that made him the biggest-selling author in the country after Harry Potter creator JK Rowling. UK sales of his cookbooks exceeded the £100 million mark in November, buoyed by his latest release - Jamie's 30-Minute Meals.
Jamie continues to make his own brand of cookery shows. Now a multi-millionaire, Jamie and his wife Jools live in London’s fashionable Primrose Hill with their children.
=======================================================
Growing up in Essex, where his parents run their own highly respected pub/restaurant in Clavering, Jamie Oliver was frequently found helping in the kitchen. At 16, Jamie left school to complete his training at Westminster Catering College. After spending time working in France and at Antonio Carluccio’s Neal Street Restaurant in London, Jamie joined the acclaimed River Café, where he worked for three and a half years alongside Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers.
In 1997, Jamie was featured in a television documentary about the River Café. Jamie was then offered his own television show, and The Naked Chef was born. The concept was to strip food down to its bare essentials, and Jamie’s hands-on style and general laid-back outlook was like a breath of fresh air, inspiring everyone to cook. The first U.S. show aired in 1999. The Naked Chef book accompanied the television series and became an instant best-seller. A second and third television series was filmed, along with the second and third tie-in books, all published by Hyperion in the United States: The Return of the Naked Chef and Happy Days with the Naked Chef.
Jamie spent the autumn of 2001 taking his show on the road; the Happy Days Tour was a huge success with more than 17,000 people packing theatres in the U.K. The tour then travelled to Australia and New Zealand with sold-out crowds in seven cities. In 2001, by personal invitation from Tony Blair, Jamie also cooked for the prime minister of Italy at Downing Street.
Jamie wanted to ‘give something back’ to the catering industry, so he opened a training restaurant in 2001 for young people who were not in full-time education or employment. Cameras documented him as he spent the year setting up a training scheme, the restaurant and the charity into which all the profits would be channeled. The series, Jamie’s Kitchen, became one of the biggest hit shows of the year in the U.K. It has now been shown in more than 35 countries and the tie-in book, also called Jamie’s Kitchen, became a runaway success. The triumph of the restaurant was shown when it won Tatler Best Restaurant Award 2003 and the Academy Award of Excellence at the Tio Pepe Carlton London Restaurant Awards the same year. Jamie was awarded an MBE in 2003 for his contribution to the hospitality industry. The Fifteen Foundation charity now owns Fifteen London and continues its work, recently recruiting the sixth year of students for training in London. The first Fifteen franchise opened in Amsterdam in 2004 and subsequent Fifteens have opened in Cornwall, the U.K. and Melbourne, Australia, in 2006.
Motivated by the lack of nutrition in U.K. school lunches, Jamie wanted to educate and motivate kids and school administrators to enjoy cooking and eating nutritious lunches. He launched a national campaign called Feed Me Better with an online petition for better school meals that garnered 271,677 signatures. In March 2005, Jamie took the petition to 10 Downing Street where the government pledged an extra $550 million to improve the standard of school meals and to provide training for lunch workers and equipment for schools. More than seven months of hard work and filming culminated in the award-winning series Jamie’s School Dinners, which prompted a public outcry to change the school meals system. A follow-up documentary, Jamie’s Return To School Dinners, aired in the U.K. in September 2006, and the British government further invested in school meals and food education for school children as a result of Jamie’s new findings.
Jamie’s Great Italian Escape, a series based on his travels around Italy and his love of Italian food, followed his school movement and was accompanied by his sixth book, Jamie’s Italy.
In addition to Jamie’s television programs and books, Jamie works with top U.K. supermarket chain Sainsbury’s, advising them on how to further improve the quality and variety of supermarket food. He has also designed several lines of quality tableware and serveware with Royal Worcester, including the most recent range, Simply Blue. Working with T-Fal, Jamie has launched three lines of cookware called the Jamie Oliver Professional Series, most recently The Italian Series. Jamie has also launched an Italian food range and has a wide range of gift foods, which are distributed internationally. He has also developed a great kitchen gadget called the Flavour ShakerTM, which launched in the U.K. in 2005 and is also being launched internationally.
Jamie’s seventh book, Cook With Jamie, was published in October 2007 by Hyperion Books. All of Jamie’s profits from this book are going to the Fifteen Foundation to help more young people start a career in the catering industry.
Through 2006 and early 2007, Jamie filmed a series and wrote a book, both called Jamie At Home. He has been successfully growing fruits, vegetables and herbs at his Essex farmhouse since 2004. The book and series, both released in 2008, reflect his new love of gardening organically as well as featuring delicious recipes inspired by the produce of his garden.
