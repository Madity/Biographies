Hugh Marston Hefner (born April 9, 1926) is an American businessman. He is an adult magazine publisher, as well as the founder and chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises.[1]
Hugh Hefner was born in Chicago, Illinois, the older of two sons (himself and brother Keith)[2] of Grace Caroline (née Swanson; 1895–1997) and Glenn Lucius Hefner (1896–1976), both teachers.[3][4] Hefner's mother was of Swedish descent, and his father had German and English ancestry.[5][6] Through his father's line, Hefner has stated that he is a direct descendant of Plymouth governor William Bradford.[7][8] He has described his family as "conservative, Midwestern, [and] Methodist".[9] He went to Sayre Elementary School and Steinmetz High School, then served as a writer for a military newspaper in the U.S. Army from 1944 to 1946. He later graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign with a B.A. in psychology with a double minor in creative writing and art in 1949, earning his degree in two and a half years. After graduation, he took a semester of graduate courses in sociology at Northwestern University but dropped out soon after.[10]
Working as a copywriter for Esquire, he left in January 1952 after being denied a $5 raise. In 1953, he mortgaged his furniture, generating a bank loan of $600, and raised $8,000 from 45 investors, including $1,000 from his mother ("Not because she believed in the venture," he told E! in 2006, "but because she believed in her son."), to launch Playboy, which was initially going to be called Stag Party. The undated first issue, published in December 1953, featured Marilyn Monroe from her 1949 nude calendar shoot and sold over 50,000 copies.[11] (Hefner, who never met Monroe, bought the crypt next to hers at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery.[12][13])
After it was rejected by Esquire magazine in 1955, Hefner agreed to publish in Playboy the Charles Beaumont science fiction short story, "The Crooked Man", about straight men being persecuted in a world where homosexuality was the norm. After receiving angry letters to the magazine, Hefner wrote a response to criticism where he said, "If it was wrong to persecute heterosexuals in a homosexual society then the reverse was wrong, too."[14]
On June 4, 1963, Hefner was arrested for selling obscene literature after an issue of Playboy featuring nude shots of Jayne Mansfield was released.[15] A jury was unable to reach a verdict.[16]
His former secretary, Bobbie Arnstein, was found dead in a Chicago hotel room after an overdose of drugs in January 1975. Hefner called a press conference to allege that she had been driven to suicide by narcotics agents and federal officers. Hefner further claimed the government was out to get him because of Playboy's philosophy and its advocacy of more liberal drug laws.[17][18]
He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for television and has made several movie appearances as himself. In 2009, he received a "worst supporting actor" nomination for a Razzie award for his performance in Miss March.
A documentary by Brigitte Berman, Hugh Hefner: Playboy, Activist and Rebel, was released on July 30, 2010. He had previously granted full access to documentary filmmaker and television producer Kevin Burns for the A&E Biography special Hugh Hefner: American Playboy in 1996.[19]
Hefner and Burns later collaborated on numerous other television projects, most notably on The Girls Next Door, a reality series that ran for six seasons (2005–2009) and 90 episodes.
In 1999, Hefner financed the Clara Bow documentary, Discovering the It Girl. "Nobody has what Clara had. She defined an era and made her mark on the nation," he stated.[20]
Hefner married Northwestern University student Mildred Williams (born 1926) in 1949. They had two children, Christie Hefner (born 1952) and David (born 1955).[21] Before the wedding, Mildred confessed that she had had an affair while he was away in the Army. He called the admission "the most devastating moment of my life." A 2006 E! True Hollywood Story profile of Hefner revealed that Mildred allowed him to sleep with other women, out of guilt for her infidelity and in the hopes that it would preserve their marriage. It didn't; they were divorced in 1959.[citation needed]
Hefner remade himself as a bon viveur and man about town, a lifestyle he promoted in his magazine and two TV shows he hosted, Playboy's Penthouse (1959–1960) and Playboy After Dark (1969–1970). He admitted to being "'involved' with maybe eleven out of twelve months' worth of Playmates" during some of these years.[22] Donna Michelle, Marilyn Cole, Lillian Müller, Shannon Tweed, Barbi Benton, Karen Christy, Sondra Theodore, and Carrie Leigh — who filed a $35 million palimony suit against him — were a few of his many lovers. In 1971, he acknowledged that he experimented in bisexuality.[23] He moved from Chicago to Los Angeles.
Hefner had a minor stroke in 1985 at the age of 59. After re-evaluating his lifestyle, he made several changes. The wild, all-night parties were toned down significantly and in 1988, daughter Christie began to run the Playboy empire. The following year, he married Playmate of the Year Kimberley Conrad. The couple had two sons, Marston Glenn (born 1990) and Cooper Bradford (born 1991).[24] The E! True Hollywood Story profile noted that the notorious Playboy Mansion had been transformed into a family-friendly homestead. After he and Conrad separated in 1998, Conrad moved into a house next door to the mansion.
Hefner then began to move an ever-changing coterie of young women into the mansion, including twins Sandy and Mandy Bentley, and even dating up to seven girls at once, among them, Brande Roderick, Izabella St. James, Tina Marie Jordan, Holly Madison, Bridget Marquardt, and Kendra Wilkinson. The reality television series The Girls Next Door depicted the lives of Madison, Wilkinson and Marquardt at the Playboy Mansion.[25] In October 2008, all three girls made the choice to leave the mansion. Hefner was quick to rebound and soon began dating his new "Number One" girlfriend, Crystal Harris,[26] along with 20-year-old identical twin models Kristina and Karissa Shannon.[27] The relationship with the twins ended in January 2010.[28] After an 11-year separation, Hefner filed for divorce from Conrad stating irreconcilable differences.[29] Hefner has said that he only remained married to her for the sake of his children,[30] and his youngest child had just turned 18.[24] The divorce was finalized in March 2010.[31] On December 24, 2010, Hefner presented an engagement ring to Crystal Harris, publicly announcing the proposal the following day.[12] Hefner and Harris had planned to marry June 18, 2011.[32][33] Harris called off the wedding just 5 days before they were due to be wed.[34] Harris and Hefner reconciled and were married on December 31, 2012.[35][36] Hefner was 86 and Harris 26.[37]
In 2012, Hefner announced that his youngest son, Cooper would likely succeed him as the public face of Playboy.[38]
The Hugh Hefner First Amendment Award was created by Christie Hefner "to honor individuals who have made significant contributions in the vital effort to protect and enhance First Amendment rights for Americans."[39]
He has donated and raised money for the Democratic Party.[40] However, he has more recently referred to himself as an independent due to disillusionment with both the Democratic and Republican parties.[41]
In 1978, Hefner helped organize fund-raising efforts that led to the restoration of the Hollywood Sign. He hosted a gala fundraiser at the Playboy Mansion and personally contributed $27,000 (or 1/9 of the total restoration costs) by purchasing the letter Y in a ceremonial auction.[42][43]
Hefner donated $100,000 to the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts to create a course called "Censorship in Cinema," and $2 million to endow a chair for the study of American film.[44]
Both through his charitable foundation and individually, Hefner also contributes to charities outside the sphere of politics and publishing, throwing fundraiser events for Much Love Animal Rescue as well as Generation Rescue,[45] a controversial anti-vaccinationist campaign organization supported by Jenny McCarthy.
On November 18, 2010, Children of the Night Founder and President Dr. Lois Lee presented Hefner with the organization's first-ever Founder's Hero of the Heart Award in appreciation for his unwavering dedication, commitment and generosity.
On April 26, 2010, Hefner donated the last $900,000 sought by a conservation group for a land purchase needed to stop the development of the famed vista of the Hollywood Sign.[42]
Sylvilagus palustris hefneri, an endangered subspecies of Marsh rabbit, is named after him in honor of financial support that he provided.[46][47]
Hefner supports legalizing same-sex marriage and he states that a fight for gay marriage is "a fight for all our rights. Without it, we will turn back the sexual revolution and return to an earlier, puritanical time."[48]

Hugh Marston Hefner joined the army after graduating from high school and went on to study art at the Chicago Art Institute. He then worked for various magazines, including Esquire, but when the magazine moved its offices to New York, Hefner remained in Chicago to start his own magazine.
The first issue of Playboy magazine, featuring a now-famous photograph of Marilyn Monroe, was produced on a kitchen table in his apartment. Hitting newsstands in December 1953, it carried no cover date because Hefner was not sure when or if he would be able to produce another.
However, the first issue sold more than fifty thousand copies and thus began the impressive life of Hefner and his globally notorious magazine. Hefner has been married twice and has four children. His daughter Christie joined her father's editorial staff and now holds the title of chairman of Playboy.
Epitomising the lifestyle promoted by his magazine, Hefner has also had a long line of mistresses. His girlfriends have included several Playboy Playmates of the Year, such as Marilyn Cole, Lillian Muller and Patty MacGuire.
He announced his engagement to 24-year-old Playboy playmate Crystal Harris on Christmas Eve 2010 via his Twitter account. The 84-year-old posted an entry which read "when I gave Crystal the [engagement] ring, she burst into tears. This is the happiest Christmas weekend in memory".
The couple announced that their wedding would take place on 18 June 2011 and Hefner said that he intends for the ceremony to be an "intimate" affair with only "a close number of friends here at the mansion". However, Harris called the whole thing off only five days before they were due to wed. They have since reconciled and eventually married in December 2012.
Hefner recently hit the headlines when he made the decision to make Playboy Enterprises private. The $207 million buyout of the company gave the octogenarian full control of the company, and it was announced that Hefner would remain as editor-in-chief, while Scott Flanders was said to be maintaining his position as CEO.
Commenting on the acquisition, Hefner said: "Today marks the beginning of an exciting era for this company and our iconic brand. I believe this new ownership structure will allow us to further capitalize on the unique and global appeal of the Playboy brand."
In 2010, Hefner donated $900,000 to a conservation group, Trust for Public Land, to prevent property developers building on a site next to the iconic Hollywood sign in the hills overlooking Los Angeles. Explaining his decision, Hefner said "the sign is Hollywood's Eiffel Tower and I am pleased to help preserve such an important cultural monument".
He also purchased the crypt in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, California beside Marilyn Monroe, so as to be interred next to her.

The Founder, Editor-in-Chief and Chief Creative Officer of Playboy, Hugh M. Hefner, is a man who has profoundly influenced society in the last 50 years while his publication remains the world’s best-selling men’s lifestyle magazine. It has inspired a media empire and one of the most recognizable brands in history.
Hefner was born in Chicago on April 9, 1926, the elder son of conservative Protestant parents, Glenn and Grace Hefner, and a direct descendent of distinguished Massachusetts Puritan patriarchs William Bradford and John Winthrop. He attended Sayre Elementary School and Steinmetz High on the West Side of Chicago, where he was no more than an average student, despite a genius IQ (152). He distinguished himself instead with his extracurricular activities: founding a school paper, writing, cartooning and serving as president of the student council where he championed student causes.
Following graduation from high school in January 1944, Hef (a nickname preferred since adolescence) joined the Army, serving as an infantry clerk and drawing cartoons for various Army newspapers. After his discharge from service in 1946, he spent the summer taking art classes (anatomy, of course) at the Art Institute of Chicago, enrolling that fall at the University of Illinois in Urbana/Champaign. Hefner earned his bachelor’s degree in two and one-half years by doubling up on classes while drawing cartoons for the Daily Illini and editing the campus humor magazine Shaft, where he introduced a new feature called Coed of the Month.
He subsequently took a semester of graduate courses in sociology at Northwestern University where, pursuing his interest in individual freedom, he wrote a term paper examining U.S. sex laws in light of the then-astonishing Kinsey Institute research on human sexuality.
In June 1949, Hefner married a classmate, Mildred Williams. Their ten-year marriage produced two children: Christie in 1952 and David in 1955.
Following college, Hef tried his hand at cartooning and, failing to sell any of his ideas for a cartoon strip, published a book of satirical cartoons about Chicago titled “That Toddlin’ Town.”
Hefner worked as an assistant personnel manager for the Chicago Carton Company for $45 a week in 1949, and as an advertising copywriter for the Carson Pirie Scott department store for just $40 a week in 1950. His future seemed uncertain when he landed a promising job as a promotion copywriter at Esquire at $60 a week in January 1951. When Esquire moved its offices to New York, his request for a five-dollar raise was denied and he decided to stay behind and start a magazine of his own.
Hefner and a fellow copywriter from Esquire tried to raise enough capital to launch a Chicago magazine and failed. While working as the newsstand promotion director of Publisher Development Corporation in 1952, he became convinced there was a market for a sophisticated men’s magazine that would reflect the views of the post-war generation and that he was the man to start it. 
To support his family, he took a better-paying job as circulation manager of Children’s Activities magazine in January 1953, but by that spring and summer the dream of starting his own magazine had become an obsession. He found a printer willing to print the first issue and a distributor to distribute it. He got friends and family to invest in the venture, raising just $8,000, including $600 of his own money borrowed from a bank using his apartment furniture as collateral.
The first issue of Playboy magazine, which featured the now-famous calendar photo of Marilyn Monroe, was produced on a kitchen table in his South Side apartment. On the newsstands in December 1953, it carried no cover date because Hefner was not sure when or if he would be able to produce another. But the first issue sold more than 50,000 copies, enough to pay for the paper and printing costs and to finance another issue.
Thereafter, Hefner never doubted that the magazine would be a success. He plowed profits back into the publication and hired a young, enthusiastic editorial, art, promotion and advertising staff to assist him. Playboy grew at a phenomenal rate. By the end of the decade, the magazine was selling more than a million copies a month and to celebrate, Hefner held the first Playboy Jazz Festival at the Chicago Stadium. It was called, at the time, the greatest single weekend in the history of jazz.
At the start of the new decade, Hefner began to live out the “Good Life” depicted in the pages of his publication. He hosted a popular syndicated television show called Playboy’s Penthouse, purchased the Playboy Mansion at 1340 North State Parkway, and opened the first Playboy Club on the Near North Side of Chicago on February 29, 1960.
Throughout the Sixties, Hefner and Playboy became what Chicago columnist Bob Greene has called “a force of nature.” Hefner wrote an extended series of editorials titled The Playboy Philosophy, championing the rights of the individual and challenging our heritage of Puritan repression. The magazine became the largest-selling, most influential men’s magazine in the world.
By 1971, when Playboy Enterprises went public, the magazine was selling seven million copies a month, there were 23 Playboy Clubs, resorts, hotels and casinos with more than 900,000 members worldwide. The company’s assets included book publishing, merchandising, a modeling agency, a limousine service, a record label and a TV and motion picture company. It was truly an empire ruled by one man.
Hefner hosted a second syndicated television show, “Playboy After Dark,” taped in Hollywood in 1968 and 1969, and in 1970 acquired the famed black Big Bunny jet, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30, in which he regularly commuted between Chicago and California and toured the world.
In 1971, he established a second residence in Los Angeles with the acquisition of a five-and-one-half acre estate in Holmby Hills known thereafter as Playboy Mansion West, where he was able to more closely supervise Playboy Enterprises’ increasing interests in television and film production.
In 1975, Hefner decided to make Los Angeles his permanent home, reflecting the extent to which Hollywood movies had influenced his dreams and aspirations as a boy. In 1980, Hefner championed the reconstruction of the Hollywood sign, then in serious disrepair, and was honored by a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his efforts. In saving the sign, Hefner referred to it as “Hollywood’s Eiffel Tower.” The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce honored him further with its first Annual Hollywood Hall of Fame Award as Outstanding Citizen of the Year. In October of 2006, Brenden Theaters at the Palms Casino Resort also recognized Hef’s ongoing dedication to the big screen with a star on its Brenden Theater Walk of Fame.
The Hollywood sign restoration was only one of Hefner and Playboy’s major projects as a part of the Hollywood creative community. The company produced such features as Roman Polanski’s “Macbeth,” distributed by Columbia Pictures, which was voted Best Picture of the Year in 1971 by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures; Monty Python’s first film, “And Now For Something Completely Different;” and “The Naked Ape,” with Universal Studios.
Playboy also produced such popular television movies as “Third Girl From The Left,” with Kim Novak and Tony Curtis; “The Death of Ocean View Park;” “The Cop and the Kid;” and “A Whale For The Killing.”
The increasingly conservative Eighties took their toll on both Hefner and his company. In 1985 he suffered a stroke that changed the direction of his life. He referred to it at the time as “a stroke of luck.”
Bringing his life full-circle, the world’s most famous bachelor was married on July 1, 1989 to Kimberly Conrad, Playboy’s 1989 Playmate of the Year. Their fairy tale courtship resulted in an uncommonly romantic wedding ceremony conducted at the wishing well where Hef first proposed at Playboy Mansion West. Their first son, Marston Glenn, was born in 1990 on April 9, the same date as Hef’s birthday, and their second son, Cooper Bradford, was born on September 4, 1991. The Hefners separated in the late 1990s and, after their sons moved on to college, divorced in early 2010.
Frequently interviewed by major news and entertainment media the world over, in-depth profiles of Hugh Hefner have appeared in publications such as Esquire, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, Time magazine and the Times of London.  In March 2001, Vanity Fair published an exhaustive, photo-illustrated 15-page profile on Hef, his lifestyle and the resurgence of the Playboy brand.
In 2003 Hefner was the subject of an A&E special, Playboy’s 50th Anniversary Celebration,a star-studded two-hour event filmed at the Playboy Mansion featuring live music, comedy performances and interviews. Hefner was also profiled in a two-hour special, “Hugh Hefner: American Playboy,” as part of A&E’s prestigious Biography series in 1996. He had previously been the subject of a feature-length documentary film, “Hugh Hefner: Once Upon A Time,” produced by Lynch/Frost Productions and distributed by IRS Releasing.
Recent profiles on Hefner include a 2008 biography written by Steven Watts titled “Mr. Playboy: Hugh Hefner and the American Dream,” Taschen’s “Hugh Hefner’s Playboy,” a six-volume illustrated autobiography with highlights from Playboy’s first 25 years, “Hugh Hefner: Girlfriends, Wives and Centerfolds” an E! True Hollywood Story, and an in-depth look at five decades of Playboy’s wildest and most famous parties hosted by Hef titled “Playboy 2000-The Party Continues.”   The roster of famous names who have enjoyed the legendary hospitality at Playboy’s Mansions in Chicago and Los Angeles over the years runs the gamut from Sammy Davis Jr., Ray Charles, Buddy Rich, Mel Torme, BB King, Tony Bennett and The Grateful Dead to Jim Carrey, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Elizabeth Hurley, Gwyneth Paltrow and many more.
In September of 2009 “Hugh Hefner: Playboy, Activist and Rebel,” a documentary focusing on Hefner’s humanitarian efforts, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. Directed by Academy Award winning documentarian Brigitte Berman, the film garnered rave reviews and is scheduled for a 2010 theatrical release.
Hefner’s most recent venture on the small screen is “The Girls Next Door” on E! Entertainment. For six seasons, this behind-the-scenes look at the Playboy Mansion has been one of the network’s top rated programs. It is an international sensation airing in more than 150 countries around the world resulting in multiple spinoff shows for the cast members.
The recipient of a number of awards for his contributions to society in general and the publishing industry in particular, Hefner received the 1996 International Publishing Award from the International Press Directory in London and was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the American Society of Magazine Editors at its 1998 ceremonies in New York.  In September 2001, Hef was inducted into the New York Friars Club as an honorary Friar on the occasion of his gala Roast in New York City, an evening of uninhibited comedy subsequently aired nationwide on the Comedy Central network. January of 2002 brought Mr. Hefner back to New York where he received the Henry Johnson Fisher Award, the highest honor of the Magazine Publishers of America. In March 2002, Hef was inducted as an honorary member of the Harvard Lampoon, which named him “Harvard Lampoon’s Best Life-Form In The History Of The Universe” and in 2008, Spike TV honored Hef with their Guy’s Choice “Alpha Male” lifetime achievement award. In early 2009, Hefner was an honored guest at the 59th Annual San Remo Music Festival in San Remo, Italy, a hugely popular event televised throughout Europe.
Throughout the years, Hef has become a fixture on the Hollywood celebrity club scene and the Mansion has once again become a mecca for entertainment industry superstars including a new wave of young motion picture and television celebrities, rock groups and more. Hollywood and cinema continue to be major factors in Hef’s personal and professional life.
At his direction, the Playboy Foundation instituted an annual Freedom of Expression Award, given at the Sundance Film Festival. Hefner underwrote the West Coast retrospective of the late British filmmaker Dennis Potter’s works at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art; he personally endowed a course in Censorship in Cinema at USC, for which he serves as a guest lecturer; and he has been a major contributor to UCLA’s project to restore classic films. In 2006, Hef made a $1 million donation to the UCLA Film & Television Archive for public screenings of American cinema, establishing The Hugh M. Hefner Classic American Film Program. He was a sponsor of the acclaimed American Cinema series on PBS, and he has long been active in seeking out and restoring such vintage films as Vitaphone shorts and the films of the Twenties British crooner Al Bowlly.
On March 28, 1996, Hefner was honored in formal ceremonies at USC for his lifelong dedication to film and his endowment of a chair for the Study of American Film at the University’s School of Cinema-Television. The Hefner gift marked only the second such endowment in the history of the prestigious film school. The other chair was endowed in memory of the late Steve Ross, who had served as chairman of Time-Warner. In 2007, Hef made a $2 million dollar donation to the USC School of Cinematic Arts to help fund a central exhibition space in the new headquarters and a new archival repository for student films and historic documents.
In 1994, Hefner established and Playboy funded the Playboy Jazz Film Festival, the first-ever showcase on the West Coast for many of the best and rarest films in the jazz lexicon. This event was in addition to the annual Jazz on Film program traditionally presented free to the public by Playboy on the eve of the Playboy Jazz Festival at the Hollywood Bowl. In 2010, the Playboy Jazz Festival celebrates its 32nd successful season.
Hefner’s personal archive at the Playboy Mansion in Holmby Hills contains more than a thousand feature films. Each weekend, he screens films at the Mansion for celebrities and personal friends: Sundays are first-run features; Friday nights are vintage classics; Saturday nights are often a mini-festival of silent films.
Hef has appeared as himself in numerous television shows and movies, including “Entourage,” “Sex and the City,” “Shark,” “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” “Last Comic Standing,” “Las Vegas,” “The Simpsons” and most recentlySony Pictures’ feature film “The House Bunny.” In 2005, the world was invited to “step into Hef’s slippers” for the launch of the hugely popular video game titled “Playboy: The Mansion,” and in the summer of 2009, Hefner was joined by a dozen Playboy Playmates for a Brett Ratner-directed commercial filmed at the Playboy Mansion for the very successful Guitar Hero gaming franchise.
In 2006, Hef celebrated his 80th birthday with weekend long festivities at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles. The celebration included the annual “Casablanca Night” movie screening and buffet dinner, a glamorous pajama and lingerie party with Playboy Playmates, celebrities and nearly 1,000 partygoers, and an appearance at the Long Beach Grand Prix in support of Playboy Racing (from the Grand Am Series) where thousands of race fans joined together to sing “Happy Birthday” to Hef. He continued the festivities in Europe as he and his girlfriends embarked on a two-week, eight-city tour visiting London, Cannes, Paris, Barcelona, Munich, Rome, Pompeii and Venice.
Hef’s dreams and fantasies again became a reality with the recent resurgence of the iconic Playboy Clubs and in 2006, the Playboy Club and Casino at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas made its official debut. Named the “Fantasy Tower,” this entertainment destination features a Playboy Club Casino and lounge, “Moon” nightclub, a Playboy retail store, the 9,000 square-foot Hugh Hefner Sky Villa and the famous Playboy Rabbit Head, emblazoned on the side of the tower. In 2007, for the first time since moving into Playboy Mansion West in 1971, Hef stepped outside his famous estate to celebrate his 81st birthday at the Palms venues, bringing dozens of Playmates along for the festivities.
Hef continues to serve as the company’s Chief Creative Officer and magazine’s Editor-in-Chief, playing a key role in determining the path of Playboy Enterprises and directing other areas of the corporation including cable television, video production, licensing and digital content. Hef has frequently been quoted as believing that the United States’ most important export is “the American Dream,” which he feels is conveyed to the world through motion pictures. His own dreams are soon expected to reach the big screen in a feature film produced by Brian Grazer and Imagine Entertainment.

      [on publishing Playboy magazine] If there was going to be a sexual revolution, I would be its pamphleteer.
      [talking about the risk of putting a nude woman in a magazine] It was risky enough that I didn't put my name on the first issue.
      [on feminists] They were wrong! The part of the women's movement that was anti-sexual was ill-conceived. The notion that women, in escaping from the bondage of over 2,000 years, should view Playboy - which helped set them free - as the enemy is an indication of real confusion. Historically it's understandable: we are a puritan people in America and women's suffrage was directly connected to the prohibitionists.
      [on being dumped by his 25 year old bride-to-be]: This was going to be my wedding day, but life is full of surprises. After all is said and done, staying single is probably for the best.

=======================================================
HUGH Hefner has gleefully enjoyed a sexually liberated life, but few know it all started with a little erotic dabbling within the Playboy czar's own family.
In his upcoming book, "Mr. Playboy: Hugh Hefner and the American Dream," Steven Watts writes how after Hefner wed his first wife, Millie, in 1949, he enlisted his friend Eldon Sellers, who would later help him co-found Playboy, into a staging a foursome.
The book relates: "One night after [Hugh] and Millie watched a stag film with Janie and Eldon Sellers, he suggested that the four of them make love on the same bed, each husband to his own wife. They did and in Sellers' words, 'It was different and exciting.' According to Millie, Hugh began to hint at switching partners, apparently suggesting it with the Sellerses, although the swap never materialized."
Hef then went further, trying a foursome out on his own family. "It did happen with his brother, Keith, and his wife, Rae, one evening," Watts writes. "[But] while Millie ultimately backed out of having sex with Keith, Hugh slept with his sister-in-law."
The book also claims Hef once tried a gay tryst. "Hefner's thirst for sexual experience became so strong that he even had a one-time homosexual experience," Watts writes. "One evening in downtown Chicago he was propositioned and, according to Sellers, he 'thought, what the hell. Found it an interesting experience. As far as I know, the guy just gave him [oral sex].' " 
When Hugh Hefner quit his job at Esquire to start a magazine called Playboy, he didn't just want to make money.  He wanted to make dreams come true.  The first issue of Playboy had a Sherlock Holmes story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, an article on the Dorsey brothers, and a feature on desk design for the modern office, called "Gentlemen, Be Seated." Hefner wrote much of the copy himself and drew all the cartoons.  But the most memorable part by far was the set of pictures he bought from a local calendar printer of a scantily clad Marilyn Monroe. 
In this wise and penetrating biography, intellectual historian Steven Watts looks at what Hugh Hefner went onto become, and how he took America with him.  Hefner became one of the most hated and envied celebrities in America, dating a long list of his magazine's beauties and always standing just barely on the wrong side of decency and moral uprightness. He also, at one time, had 7 million subscribers to his magazine.  Though in time he would lose readers to more explicit magazines on one side and "lad" magazines on the other, the Playboy brand never lost its luster.

																				Hugh Hefner's Sex Life: Playboy Founder Says He's Slept With More Than A Thousand Women

Hugh Hefner is the original Playboy, and the magazine's founder reveals he's made a lot of notches in his bedpost over the years. Somehow, we're not surprised. 
In a new interview with Esquire, the 86-year-old confesses to sleeping with thousands of women over the years. 
"How could I possibly know? Over a thousand, I'm sure," Hefner replied when asked how many women he's taken to bed in his lifetime. "There were chunks of my life when I was married, and when I was married I never cheated. But I made up for it when I wasn't married. You have to keep your hand in."
Hefner  was first married in 1949 to a Northwestern University student named Mildred Williams, with whom he has two children -- Christie and David -- before divorcing in 1959. 
It would be another 40 years before Hefner would marry again -- giving him ample time to bed the thousands of women he claims to have wooed, without cheating. 
In 1989, Hefner said "I do" again, this time to Playmate of the Year Kimberley Conrad, whom he separated from in 1998 and finally divorced in 2010. 
During his 12 year separation from Conrad, Hefner had relationships with many of the young models featured in his magazine, including twin sisters Sandy and Mandy Bently, and even dated seven women at once. His relationship with Playboy Playmates Holly Madison, Bridget Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson was made public with the reality series "The Girls Next Door." 
In 2008, all three women decided to leave both Hefner and the Playboy mansion, prompting Hefner to start dating Crystal Harris, who was 60 years his junior, along with 20-year-old twins Kristina and Karissa Shannon. Hefner broke things off with the twins and proposed to Harris in 2010. 
The couple planned to marry in June 2011, but Harris decided to call off their nuptials just five days before they were scheduled to exchange their vows. Hefner and Harris reconciled and Hef tied the knot for the third time this past New Year's Eve. And while Hef knows there are those who doubt their marriage, they don't concern him in the least. 
"All our friends think it's made in heaven," Hefner told Esquire of his new bride. "It's only people who don't know us, who simply see us as stereotypes in terms of age and beauty… I just feel very, very fortunate to have found her at this stage in my life. I saved the best till last."
