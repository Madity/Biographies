Dyer was born in Detroit, Michigan, to the late Melvin Lyle and Hazel Irene Dyer and spent much of his childhood (until he was ten years old) in an orphanage on the east side of Detroit.[1] After graduation from Denby High School Dyer served in the United States Navy from 1958 to 1962. He received his DEd degree in counseling from Wayne State University.[2]
Dyer worked as a high school guidance counselor in Detroit and as a professor of counselor education at St. John's University in New York City.[1] He pursued an academic career, published in journals and established a private therapy practice. His lectures at St. John's, which focused on positive thinking and motivational speaking techniques, attracted many students. A literary agent persuaded Dyer to document his theories in his first book called Your Erroneous Zones. Dyer quit his teaching job and began a publicity tour of the United States of America, doggedly pursuing bookstore appearances and media interviews ("out of the back of his station wagon", according to Michael Korda, making the best-seller lists "before book publishers even noticed what was happening"[3]), which eventually led to national television talk show appearances including Merv Griffin, The Tonight Show, and Phil Donahue.[1]
Dyer proceeded to build on his success with lecture tours, a series of audiotapes, and regular publication of new books. Dyer's message resonated with many in the New Thought Movement and beyond. He often recounted anecdotes from his family life, and repeatedly used his own life experience as an example. His self-made man success story was a part of his appeal.[1] Dyer told readers to pursue self actualization, calling reliance on the self as a guide to "religious" experience, and suggested that readers emulate Jesus Christ, whom he termed both an example of a self-actualized person, and a "preacher of self-reliance".[4] Dyer criticized societal focus on guilt, which he saw as an unhealthy immobilization in the present due to actions taken in the past. He advocated readers to see how parents, institutions, and even they, themselves, have imposed guilt trips upon themselves.[5]
Although Dyer initially resisted the spiritual tag, by the 1990s he had altered his message to include more components of spirituality when he wrote the book Real Magic, and discussed higher consciousness, in the book Your Sacred Self.[1][6]
Dyer has been criticized by some PBS viewers for his appearances on PBS during their pledge drives and his teachings have been characterized by some of these viewers as superficial platitudes that lack rigor and have limited practical or intellectual value.[7]
In May 2010, author Stephen Mitchell, husband of New Age author Byron Katie, filed a suit against Dyer for plagiarism, accusing him of taking 200 lines of his interpretation of the Tao Te Ching for his books Living the Wisdom of the Tao and Change Your Thoughts – Change Your Life.[8]
Psychotherapist Albert Ellis writes that Wayne Dyer's book Your Erroneous Zones is probably "the worst example" of plagiarism of Ellis' Rational Emotive Therapy (RET).[9] In a 1985 letter to Dyer, Ellis claims that Dyer had participated in a workshop Ellis gave on RET before Dyer published his book, in which Dyer appeared to understand RET very well. Ellis adds that "300 or more people have voluntarily told me ... that [the book] was clearly was derived from RET." Ellis admonishes Dyer for unethically and unprofessionally not giving Ellis credit as the book's primary source, but expresses overall gratitude for Dyer's work, writing: "Your Erroneous Zones is a good book, ... it has helped a great number of people, and ... it outlines the main principles of RET quite well, ... with great simplicity and clarity." [10]
Dyer has been married three times. He has a daughter, Tracy, from his first wife, Judy. His second wife was Susan Casselman (no children). He has five children (Skye, Summer, Serena, Sands, and Sage) with his third wife, Marcelene, who has two children (Shane and Stephanie) from a prior marriage. Wayne and Marcelene legally separated in 2001 after twenty years of marriage.[11]
"My beliefs are that the truth is a truth until you organize it, and then becomes a lie. I don't think that Jesus was teaching Christianity, Jesus was teaching kindness, love, concern, and peace. What I tell people is don't be Christian, be Christ-like. Don't be Buddhist, be Buddha-like."[12] "Religion is orthodoxy, rules and historical scriptures maintained by people over long periods of time. Generally people are raised to obey the customs and practices of that religion without question. These are customs and expectations from outside the person and do not fit my definition of spiritual."[13]
Day & Night (2010), an animated short film created by Pixar and which was shown along with Toy Story 3 during the movie's opening in the U.S., featured an excerpt from one of Dyer's lectures.[14]

Spiritual and motivational leader Wayne Dyer is perhaps best known (to anyone over the age of 40) for his work Your Erroneous Zones, the top-selling book of the 1970s (35 million copies, which I’d heard was just ahead of the Bible in sales for that decade.)
He’s written over 30 books and has appeared on Oprah, The Tonight Show and thousands of other programs. Most recently he can be seen as a regular guest on Ellen.
Much of his earlier work was focused solely on more traditional self-improvement, but switched in the 1990s to areas of self-actualization (with a touch of New Agey-ness).
In fact, his books Manifest Your Destiny (1997) and The Power of Intention (2004) seem to have set in motion the extreme popularization of “manifestation” in the 2000s, which ultimately culminated with The Secret and the plethora of other knock-offs that followed. Wayne himself had been asked to participate in The Secret movie but turned it down over what seemed to him as watered down theories and superficiality.
Wayne Dyer, was born to Melvin Lyle and Hazel Dyer, on May 10, 1940, in Detroit, Michigan. His childhood was pretty difficult, having spent the first ten years of his life in and out of different Detroit orphanages and foster homes.
Wayne is the youngest of three brothers, who along with their mother were abandoned by their father. Melvin was an abusive alcoholic who had done prison time, and was not much of a part of the family’s life. In fact, Wayne never formally met his father. Melvin ended up passing away in the early 1970s, just before Wayne had begun to express interest in meeting him.
(You can listen hear to an interview Wayne did with Tony Robbins is the early 90s where among other things he talks about his search for his father and how he made his first book a bestseller.) PART 1 & PART 2
As a young mother, Hazel could not support Wayne and his brothers, and was forced to enter her children into foster care until she could get on her feet.
She worked as a candy girl for $17 a week, and it took her quite a few years before she could reunite the family. Wayne was ten years old by the time she regained custody.
He’s repeatedly cited these difficult years as being hugely formative in terms of his spirit and resilience, and that it helped him become a better teacher of how to overcome adversity.
Wayne joined the Navy in his late teens, served 4 years and then enrolled at (coincidentally) Wayne State University. At age 25, he started his professional career as a high school guidance counselor. Six years later, after receiving his doctorate in education, he became a professor at St. John’s University in New York. He was on his way to a traditional academic career publishing articles in trade journals and building a thriving counseling practice, but his life started to take a different direction.
He found that his talks on self-improvement we’re growing steadily in popularity. These talks ultimately led to the publishing of Your Erroneous Zones. So he decided to leave St. John’s (even after being offered tenure), and devote himself full-time to being an author. But the book was not an instant bestseller. In fact, the first printing run was only 3000 copies… all of which he bought himself.
With Erroneous Zones not selling, he spent the next year on the road promoting the book from town to town, going on local radio shows, convincing small bookstores to carry it. He would even make multiple calls to the same bookstore pretending to be customers asking about the book (using fake foreign accents each time of course – LOL).
By the time he reached the West Coast, he had already pushed the book using sweat and tears to the N.Y. Times bestseller list, but he really hit it big when he ended up on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson with 3 straight appearances in one week. That kind of exposure propelled him (and the book) to superstar status, and officially launched him into cultural consciousness.
Since then he’s been on a tear, each year releasing new books, audio-programs and lectures on PBS based on his teachings and philosophy.

I’m surprised (and glad) to learn that he turned down “The Secret”.  I wasn’t a big fan of that book but I loved “The Power of Intention.”  They should really make that required reading in high schools.  It’s so powerful.
Great article! Im a big fan of wayne dyer. I see him whenever he comes near my city, which this year is 3 times! Lucky me!
I enjoy your blog at first glance and just subscribed. and am working on my own blog to get some stuff together. Its not launched yet, but maybe when it is you can give me a few pointers? Perhaps i could interview you about your work.

Wayne Dyer said, "...my wife, to whom I was married to for twenty years and have seven children with, met somebody else and left me. I was confronted with another huge shift in my life that took much more of the breath out of me than my heart attack. Im sort of coming to grips with that. Im learning what it means to have someone you love very much leave you."
"Clear-thinking people might ask for some proof that Dr. Dyers theories have actually worked. Has Dr. Dyer been able to heal himself? Actually, a stent had to be inserted in a clogged artery when Dr. Dyer suffered a heart attack a few years ago. Has he been able to find the right people when he needs them?  Actually, after twenty years of marriage and the blessings of seven children, Dr. Dyers wife left him for someone else. So despite Dr. Dyers obvious devotion to the idea that we can perform miracles, his own life actually denies the veracity of his theories." 
Additional info This happened near the time of his heart attack, about 3-4 years ago http://www.waynedyerbooks.com/index.asp 
How devastating. I know Dyer talks about how he used this bad experience as the basis for his Power of Intenion book, but my heart would be broken - especially after that much history and 7 children.
						How devastating. I know Dyer talks about how he used this bad experience as the basis for his Power of Intenion book, but my heart would be broken - especially after that much history and 7 children.
I had no idea this was the basis of the new book.   My heart goes out to him.    As someone who is trying to deal with the end of a 20 year relationship with no kids (four months ago tomorrow  cry ), I am totally devastated.   All of the metaphysical principles fail me in grief.   I find myself unable to focus on anything but the loss.     Hope seems gone forever.
I would like to know more on how Wayne handled this incredible challenge and how he is doing now.

As someone who was raised Catholic who has watched the church become less and less about the teachings and more and more about being gatekeepers for the rest of us, I take this article in the spirit it is written- The author is fearful.    Fearful of God, fearful of another path to God other than the Catholic Church.    The obvious sarcasm in the author's comments are not of God/Love.   It has to be fear.

I had a close friend end their 19 year marriage out of the blue (or so it seemed), and now a year later they have both moved on to new lives... knowing they will still be part of each others lives because of their son -- but they won't be part of each others daily life.
I'd offer you a Dyer quote"Everything we feel is missing from our life we're already connected to..."
I think we all forget what we are connected to from time to time...or at least I know that I have to remind myself to only focus on what I want to manifest. For you, I hope (gentle attempt at comedy) you choose to pursue hope.  8)

Marianne Williamson, who does lectures on ACIM, says only the love was real and the love is never lost, that it will never die.    But that's in the bigger picture, outside the world of form.    In this human existence, the emotions of loss and grief are very real.
I am very interested to know how Wayne was able to find inspiration in what had to be a devastating time in his life. 
						Is loss another lesson we have to go through, or just something we are supposed to expect, as everything and everyone is only on loan to us?
I was also having trouble with Dr. Dyer's principles in the middle of my mother/best friends sudden death. No warning, only middle aged, no illness, I just found her on the floor. Knowing he has some experience with a loss somewhat similar helps. I'm sure he has been grateful for the time he spent with her, but has he been able to to be thankful for her leaving? I am having trouble being thankful the death of my mom. I can be thankful for some aspects of it, and of her life, but not the circumstances and timing of death. Anyone have any ideas?						
						I have had a LOT of pain in my life. I think you can only understand it once the emotion is removed. 
Time will heal the emotional wound, and the wound is only the attachment to whatever is lost. Actually, nothing is ever lost. It is simply an illusion.
Recently watching you on TV, I was thinking to myself  he has changed and almost look exhausted. He must give himself too much in those conferences...
It never occured to me that anything could happen in your life that you didn't wanted to...  I was beginning thinking of you as somebody just a little more than human...
Yesterday (Saturday, October 24) I was at your conference in Montreal. I was very glad and very proud to be there because I think it was your first time in Montréal.  When you played the song of St-Francis sunged by Skye, I ran away from the room (didn't realizing I was in front and the room was so far away from the exit...) Neither than I did know of the little  controversy about the song...
Anyway, I wish you to take good care of your health and of yourself. And I can't prevent myself from saying that your wife, choosing another man instead of yourself, surely didn't want to continue to live with someone so great, choosing a somebody more ordinary...  Sure I have no idea what your 20 years together meant, but I found that... Anyhow, it's not of my business. I must stop these nonsense talkings...
Hoping to see you soon back in Montreal -and this time, don't miss bringing us wonderful loving Skye...
An Chinese couple and their son worked on their small piece of field everyday trying to make a living.
One day about 30 horses came past their plot one day, and they captured the horses. The next day the community from the town came to the family and told the old man how happy they are for his good fortune. The old man replied, “If it is a good thing or a bad thing I do not know, I will wait and see what path it takes and what it brings” 
The son then tried to break in the horses, fell and broke his hip. He was crippled by this. The next day the community from the town came to the family and told the old man how sad they are for the bad luck which fell upon his son.  The old man replied, “If it is a good thing or a bad thing I do not know, I will wait and see what path it takes and what it brings”. 
A few years later wat broke out. All the healthy males were gathered and sent to the frontline. The next day the community from the town came to them and told the old man how happy they are in that his son was not sent to the army. The old man replied, “If it is a good thing or a bad thing I do not know, I will wait and see what path it takes and what it brings” 
I praise God in that I cannot see in the future, otherwise I would not wanted to live. One would not see the blissful times as we do not fear them.   
Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved. 
This was my first message and I wanted to be nice, above all, to look nice! Furthermore, I didn't want to write on such a trivial and personal subject!!  But I'm curious like everybody!...
Dr Dyer is a nice wonderful spiritual teacher. Thank God for all who can benefit from his really excellent teachings. That's what's important to us!  That, he is so generous with his mind and knowledge because, generally, those who really know keep it for themselves to gain power and influence.
Personally, I think he's not so nice in his private life (with women, maybe!?) But from his teachings and public appearances, my intuition makes me sure he is a great father and a very honest man. Also, he's someone strong and courageous and highly conscious of all his own "weaknesses"... 
And being in Christmas Time and wanting to be authentic (and even not afraid of becoming a bit disturbing) I must say I'm jalous of his public success, his 8 children loving him, his dreamlife house in Maui, his facility making great relationships...  But what does anybody want to do with that. ... It's mean and unfair to say? I don't care! because I'm not somebody mean and unfair. To the contrary.  
I' m just somebody not afraid of telling the truth of what he really felt ...and maybe many hypocrites having already said so nice thing might rejoice at the bottom of their brownished hearts...						
						Wow...I am so shocked by this. I just discovered Wayne Dyer's material a few months ago and I came across this thread...and I had no idea he was divorced.
I cannot believe it...Wayne is such a beautiful human being, his words and wisdom have such healing power. I enjoy his material very very much and I am sad to hear that something like this had happened to him.
I am sure he is a much better person because of all of this and I wish him great love and happiness!						
						Here we go again !!!!!  Yup in our all too human mind (mine, too) we see these things as formidable and sad and scary and all kinds of negative, but if we review Wayne's thoughts we'll find that HE KNOWS that they are not as they appear!!!!
We can never know "why" until it is time to know "why"  We can never take the "good" until it is time for us to see what was good  
Maybe he is being used to teach someone else  Of course the "maybes" are endless  So maybe we need to keep him (and her) in our prayers and continue his good works
Oh, and in reply to a comment that REALLY fueled my fire    WAYNE KNOWS THAT HE DOES NOT HEAL HIMSELF that he is only a conduit for a Greater Source
						New to the site also; found it specifically because I just read elsewhere the news about his divorce.  All the varied opinions and thoughts expressed here do not surprise me ~ human nature in all its colors and hues and perspectives being expressed.
For me personally?  I feel no differently about the man and his thoughts and ideas; he's provided me with much to contemplate over the years through his books ~ having seen him in person convinced me the man speaks with integrity and from his own sense of personal truth.  His energy was "honest".  He works a system to the best of his ability - that he did not create ~ it is what it is, driven by much that he tries to encourage us to let go of.  Some are ready to do that...some not.
What happened to his relationship is just another experience along his path; I expect nothing less from him than that he handle it from the spiritual center of his beliefs from which his books have sprung.  And I suspect that he will continue to share his personal journey with us by writing in the future about how this experience has affected him and brought further insight.
Anyone who has followed this mans' growth over the years, should not...and indeed if they've learned anything at all on their own journey...cannot ~ judge him.						
						Manifest your destiny talks about manifesting YOUR destiny.Not someone elses.You cannot controll other peoples actions and deeds.He also talks about lifes peaks and valleys.Just because he went through a valley it does not mean his messege is not true.In fact,him being honest, incredbly loving and compasionate towards his wife is testament to his teachings.No one is perfect.But we are all perfect in our imperfection.						
						Hi everyone!  I'm new to the board so bear with me.  )  Although I certainly don't have as many years on the board as Wayne Dyer and Marcelene do, I can somewhat understand what he's going through.  I am once divorced and now getting out of my second long-term relationship of 9 years.  Neither one of us left the other for other people (or so this is what I believe) but it still hurts when you are separating from someone after that long of a history.  I don't even have kids so I truly can't imagine what Dr. Dyer is going through.  My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family and that they all can heal together through this.  I'm sure Dr. Dyer is focusing on all the good that he shared and will always share with his wife (it certainly doesn't mean the relationship stops here, it has just shifted into a different kind of relationship...and both will always include love).  I'm trying to focus on not being so angry on not seeing things a little more clearly than after 9 years...but I believe things happen and emerge at the time they're supposed to to, either to open more doors for both of us or for whatever reason the universe has for us at that time.  Anyway, I'm blabbing.....I wish Dr. Dyer all the best and I want to thank him for his powerful messages and healing spirit both to me and my family growing up.  )  
						I have listened to Wayne Dyer for about 30 years now.  I had some of his audio tapes many years ago, before he was so well known.  His beliefs are so close to the way myself and my husband feel.  My husband, who is also a great influence on my life, has said so many of the same truths that Dr. Dyer says. 
Anyhow, it brought tears to my eyes to hear of the breakup of him and his wife.  I just couldn't imagine anyone leaving him for someone else. 
						I was very surprised to see Wayne's wife on this winter's PBS special.  Also very, very happy.  Obviously, his 'theories' work!
Some of the previous posts here (over 2 years) have suggested that somehow his 'divorce', if that is what happened ultimately with Marcie, was a failure.  God bless us all, but divorce, like physical death and physical birth, is often just a spiritual transition, or can be...obviously, I've been there! Twice!  
I believe and have experienced that divorce has been 'demonized' and that the end of many relationships can be a wonderful rebirth, if we can let go of society's tendency to turn every divorce into an emotional drama.  
To those of you going through break-ups reading this, please take heart.  A marriage takes two, and no matter how it may seem, our partners have the right to change.  We ALL have the right to change.  What I've seen so often is that a change in one partner produces insecurity in another, and divorce follows.  Is it necessary to divorce - that's what I wonder, sincerely.  If it is, why is that divorce necessarily 'bad'?  
Betrayal (as when someone leaves or cheats) can be an opportunity for healing and growth.  To quote Don Miguel Ruiz' Four Agreements - 'nothing anyone does is ever because of you.  It's about what they believe to be true within themselves'.  The exception here would be when an abuser is dumped - no one should stay in such a relationship, including verbal and emotional abuse.
Finally, since no one is here to stop me !  Let me suggest that perhaps a life-long marriage is an unrealistic expectation, at least in American society.  Americans are not encouraged to have a spiritual partner, but to find someone they approve of who approves of them in return.  Think about it.
						To me Dr. Dyer's message is this yes you can manifest miracles in your life but you cannot stop life from happening (and life includes everything and EVERYONE around us). However, if we have a strong faith in the Universe/ God/.....(fill the gap) then we move through suffering quicker and acceptance comes earlier. 
We cannot stop suffering but we can stop it from taking over our lives (I confess I am not quite there yet). I've seen this in people who have a strong faith. 
For example, a person like Dr. Dyer will have spent most of his life in harmony with God, therefore when he looks back he sees a lot of bliss. For some of us, me included, the past might have filled with lots of grief that could have been avoided if we were connected to the higher source. Add to that the grief THAT COULD NOT be avoided (say death of a loved one) and you have a lifetime of misery.						
						I know this post is old, I just stumbled upon it through various google searches. With regard to Toni Collin's (erroneous) remarks I'd say 2 things
1. No amount of will or intention is going to change that we (Dr. Dyer included) are human beings, with human organs, and human biological failures. It's not a matter of "if", but "when" our bodies start to go kaput. I think they read further into his words than he does.
2. No amount of our own will, intention, or meditation is going to keep someone around who doesn't want to be there. We can't will for others, only ourselves.						
						Some of the previous posts here (over 2 years) have suggested that somehow his 'divorce', if that is what happened ultimately with Marcie, was a failure. 
I don't know that I would see divorce as a "failure" per se than a passage. How about couples that have been together for decades (usually out of some sense of obligation to children or the institution of marriage itself) and miserable. Is that a success? If you define "success" as receiving the intended results of a given action, I don't think they ever planned this for themselves. Not very "successful" in my book. 
A divorce is what it is. A seperation on the basis of irreconcilable differences. That's not a failure. That's just change.  Everybody has different values that are subject to change on a moment's notice and they are not always compatible with the people they share their lives with.						
						In the late 1970's I was introduced to Dr. Wayne Dyer's book "Your Erroneous Zones" while I was out of high school for a few months with emotional difficulties. I saw how I could take control of my own emotions and not feel guilty anymore for the way I was feeling. Long story short, his philosphies and teachings whether originally his own, or borrowed and exanded upon, have been quite instrumental in keeping me grounded and balanced for most of my life. He is an amazing indivdual who is extremely gifted. Hearing about his divorce only gives me added strength to know that he too has gone through what I have unfortunately had to go through.  However, I can say that so much growth has come from my divorce. Perhaps the same will be true of Dr. Dyer. He has helped me through the late 70's, the 80's, the 90's, and still today. He was a true inspiration to me to want to help change the world when I took Psychology as my major in college.  I am still on my path, based on that same concept. Onward Dr. Dyer. You are a diamond in the rough! A true gem that shines!						
						I find Toni Collins comment to be both closeminded and judgemental. As anyone who has spent anytime with Dr. Dyer's material fully knows, miracles are not defined as Christmas presents. Miracles are the choices we make in our lives and how we choose to respond to the events in them. The miracle is that we can create our life by defining our responses. Dr. Dyer's response to this devastating event in anyone's life is a testimony to his work and a powerful validation of the truth contained in his teachings. As someone who is divorced and now remarried (and very happily) I have sense of the pain involved though I did not have children involved - thankfully. In my eyes, Dr. Dyer's divorce does not diminish his teachings or contributions - it enhances them.

Dr. Wayne Dyer is one of the most popular self-empowerment speakers and authors in the world. Although his childhood years were difficult, spending time in orphanages and foster homes, his personal struggle to overcome these obstacles and make his own dreams come true has inspired thousands of fans who refer to him as the “father of motivation.” When he’s not traveling the globe delivering his uplifting message, Wayne Dyer is writing from his home in Maui.
Dr. Dyer has written 30 books, recorded numerous audio programs, has appeared on over 5,200 television and radio programs including Oprah, The Today Show, and The Tonight Show, and has been interviewed in dozens of popular magazines. In 1985 he was selected as one of six prominent Americans, and his “A Letter to the Next Generation” appeared in Time magazine.
A psychotherapist, Wayne Dyer received his doctorate in counseling psychology from Wayne State University and was an associate professor at St. John’s University in New York. He has taught at many levels of education bringing self-empowerment to students from high school through graduate study. Dr. Dyer’s unique approach to life includes a focus on spiritual as well as mental and physical energy.
