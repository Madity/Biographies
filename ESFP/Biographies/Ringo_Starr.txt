Ringo Starr MBE (born Richard Starkey; 7 July 1940) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. On most of the band's albums, he sang lead vocals for one song, including "With a Little Help from My Friends", "Yellow Submarine" and their cover of "Act Naturally". He also wrote the Beatles' songs "Don't Pass Me By" and "Octopus's Garden", and is credited as a co-writer of others, such as "What Goes On" and "Flying".
Starr was twice afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during his childhood, and as a result of prolonged hospitalisations, fell behind scholastically. In 1955, he entered the workforce and briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze, developing a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he cofounded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, and they earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958.
When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success with them in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After their break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number four hit "It Don't Come Easy", and number ones "Photograph" and "You're Sixteen". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, "Back Off Boogaloo", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top ten release in both the UK and the US. Although he continued to record and remained a familiar celebrity presence, by 1975 his solo career had diminished in importance. He has been featured in a number of documentaries, hosted television shows, narrated the first two seasons of the children's television series Thomas & Friends and portrayed "Mr Conductor" during the first season of the PBS children's television series Shining Time Station. Since 1989, he has successfully toured with twelve variations of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band.
Starr's creative contribution to music has received praise from drummers such as Phil Collins and Steve Smith, who commented: "Before Ringo, drum stars were measured by their soloing ability and virtuosity. Ringo's popularity brought forth a new paradigm ... we started to see the drummer as an equal participant in the compositional aspect ... His parts are so signature to the songs that you can listen to a Ringo drum part without the rest of the music and still identify the song."[3] In 2011, Rolling Stone readers named Starr the fifth-greatest drummer of all time.
Richard Starkey was born on 7 July 1940, at 9 Madryn Street, Dingle, Liverpool, Lancashire, England, the son of confectioners Elsie (née Gleave) and Richard Starkey.[4][nb 1] Elsie enjoyed singing and dancing, a hobby that she shared with her husband, an avid fan of swing.[6] Prior to the birth of their son, whom they nicknamed "Ritchie", the couple had spent much of their free time on the local ballroom circuit, but soon after his birth their regular outings ended.[7] Elsie adopted an overprotective approach to raising her son that bordered on fixation. Subsequently, "Big Ritchie", as Starkey's father became known, lost interest in his family, choosing instead to spend long hours drinking and dancing in pubs, sometimes for several consecutive days.[7]
In 1944, in an effort to reduce their housing costs, his family moved to another neighbourhood in the Dingle, 10 Admiral Grove; soon afterwards, his parents separated, and they divorced within the year.[8] Starkey later stated that he has "no real memories" of his father, who made little effort to bond with him, visiting as few as three times thereafter.[9] Elsie found it difficult to survive on her ex-husband's support payments of thirty shillings a week, so she took on several menial jobs cleaning houses before securing a position as a local barmaid, an occupation that she enjoyed for twelve years.[10]
At age six Starkey developed appendicitis. Following a routine appendectomy he contracted peritonitis, causing him to fall into a coma that lasted for three days.[11] His recovery spanned twelve months, which he spent away from his family at Liverpool's Myrtle Street Children's hospital.[12] Upon his discharge in May 1948, his mother allowed him to stay home, causing him to miss school.[13] At age eight, he remained illiterate, with a poor grasp of mathematics.[13] His lack of education contributed to a feeling of alienation at school, which resulted in him regularly playing truant at Sefton Park.[14] After several years of twice weekly tutoring from his surrogate sister and neighbour, Marie Maguire Crawford, Starkey had nearly caught up to his peers academically, but in 1953, he contracted tuberculosis and was admitted to a sanatorium, where he remained for two years.[15] During his stay the medical staff made an effort to stimulate motor activity and relieve boredom by encouraging their patients to join the hospital band, leading to his first exposure to a percussion instrument; a makeshift mallet made from a cotton bobbin that he used to strike the cabinets next to his bed.[16] Soon afterwards, he grew increasingly interested in drumming, receiving a copy of the Alyn Ainsworth song "Bedtime for Drums" as a convalescence gift from Crawford.[17] Starkey commented: "I was in the hospital band ... That's where I really started playing. I never wanted anything else from there on ... My grandparents gave me a mandolin and a banjo, but I didn't want them. My grandfather gave me a harmonica ... we had a piano – nothing. Only the drums."[18]
Starkey attended St Silas, a Church of England primary school near his house where his classmates nicknamed him "Lazarus", and later Dingle Vale Secondary modern school, where he showed an aptitude for art and drama, as well as practical subjects including mechanics.[19] As a result of the prolonged hospitalisations, he fell behind his peers scholastically and was ineligible for the 11-plus qualifying examination required for attendance at a grammar school.[20] On 17 April 1953, Starkey's mother married Harry Graves, an ex-Londoner who had moved to Liverpool following the failure of his first marriage.[21] Graves, an impassioned fan of big band music and their vocalists, introduced Starkey to recordings by Dinah Shore, Sarah Vaughan and Billy Daniels.[22] Graves stated that he and "Ritchie" never had an unpleasant exchange between them; Starkey later commented: "He was great ... I learned gentleness from Harry."[23] After the extended hospital stay following Starkey's recovery from tuberculosis, he did not return to school, preferring instead to stay at home and listen to music while playing along by beating biscuit tins with sticks.[24]
Beatles biographer Bob Spitz described Starkey's upbringing as "a Dickensian chronicle of misfortune".[25] Houses in the area were "poorly ventilated, postage-stamp-sized ... patched together by crumbling plaster walls, with a rear door that opened onto an outhouse."[25] Crawford commented: "Like all of the families who lived in the Dingle, he was part of an ongoing struggle to survive."[25] The children who lived there spent much of their time at Princes Park, escaping the soot-filled air of their coal-fuelled neighbourhood.[25] Adding to their difficult circumstances, violent crime was an almost constant concern for people living in one of the oldest and poorest inner-city districts in Liverpool.[26] Starkey later commented: "You kept your head down, your eyes open, and you didn't get in anybody's way."[27]
After his return home from the sanatorium in late 1955, Starkey entered the UK workforce, but lacking motivation and discipline, his initial attempts at gainful employment proved unsuccessful.[28] In an effort to secure himself some warm clothes, he briefly held a position at British Rail, who supplied their employees with suits. They gave him a hat, but no uniform, and unable to pass the physical examination, he was laid off and granted unemployment benefits.[29] He then found work as a waiter serving drinks on a day boat that travelled from Liverpool to North Wales, but his fear of conscription into military service led him to quit the job, not wanting to give the Royal Navy the impression that he was suitable for seafaring work.[30] In mid-1956, Graves secured Starkey a position as an apprentice machinist at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. While working at the facility Starkey befriended Roy Trafford, and the two bonded over their shared interest in music.[31] Trafford introduced him to skiffle, and he quickly became a fervent admirer.[31]
Soon after Trafford piqued Starkey's interest in skiffle, the two began rehearsing songs in the manufacturing plant's cellar during their lunch breaks. Trafford recalled: "I played a guitar, and [Ritchie] just made a noise on a box ... Sometimes, he just slapped a biscuit tin with some keys, or banged on the backs of chairs."[31] The pair were joined by Starkey's neighbour and co-worker, the guitarist Eddie Miles, forming the Eddie Miles Band, later renamed Eddie Clayton and the Clayton Squares after a Liverpool landmark.[32] The band performed popular skiffle songs such as "Rock Island Line" and "Walking Cane", with Starkey raking a thimble across a washboard, creating primitive, driving rhythms.[33] Starkey enjoyed dancing as his parents had years earlier, and he and Trafford briefly took dance lessons at two schools. Though the lessons were short-lived, they provided Starkey and Trafford with an introduction that allowed them to dance competently while enjoying nights out on the town.[33]
On Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a second-hand drum kit consisting of a snare drum, bass drum and a makeshift cymbal fashioned from an old rubbish bin lid. Although basic and crude, the kit facilitated his progression as a musician while increasing the commercial potential of the Eddie Clayton band, who went on to book several prestigious local gigs before the skiffle craze faded in early 1958 as American rock and roll became popular in the UK.[34]
In November 1959, Starkey joined Al Caldwell's Texans, a skiffle group who were looking for someone with a proper drum kit so that the group could transition from one of Liverpool's best-known skiffle acts to a full-fledged rock and roll band.[35][nb 2] They had begun playing local clubs as the Raging Texans, then Jet Storm and the Raging Texans before settling on Rory Storm and the Hurricanes soon before recruiting Starkey.[37] About this time he adopted the stage name Ringo Starr; derived from the rings he wore and also because it implied a country western influence. His drum solos were billed as Starr Time.[38]
By early 1960 the Hurricanes had become one of Liverpool's leading bands.[39] In May, they were offered a three-month residency at a Butlins holiday camp in Wales.[40] Although initially reluctant to accept the residency and end his five-year machinist apprenticeship that he had begun four years earlier, Starr eventually agreed to the arrangement.[41] The Butlins gig led to other opportunities for the band, including an unpleasant tour of US Air Force bases in France about which Starr commented: "The French don't like the British; at least I didn't like them."[42] The Hurricanes became so successful that when initially offered a highly coveted residency in Hamburg, they turned it down due to their prior commitment with Butlins.[43] They eventually accepted, joining the Beatles at Bruno Koschmider's Kaiserkeller on 1 October 1960, where Starr first met the band.[44] Storm's Hurricanes were given top-billing over the Beatles, who also received less pay.[45] Starr performed with the Beatles during a few stand-in engagements while in Hamburg. On 15 October 1960, he drummed with John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison, recording with them for the first time while backing Hurricanes singer Lu Walters on the George Gershwin aria "Summertime".[46][nb 3] During Starr's first stay in Hamburg he also met Tony Sheridan, who valued his drumming abilities to the point of asking Starr to leave the Hurricanes and join his band.[48]

Starr quit Rory Storm and the Hurricanes in January 1962 and briefly joined Sheridan in Hamburg before returning to the Hurricanes for a third season at Butlins.[49][nb 4] On 14 August, Lennon asked Starr to join the Beatles; he accepted.[51] On 16 August, Beatles manager Brian Epstein fired their drummer, Pete Best, who recalled: "He said 'I've got some bad news for you. The boys want you out and Ringo in ... He said [Beatles producer] George Martin wasn't too pleased with my playing [and] the boys thought I didn't fit in."[52] Starr first performed as a member of the band on 18 August 1962, at a Horticultural Society dance at Port Sunlight.[53] After his appearance at the Cavern Club the following day, Best fans, upset by his firing, held vigils outside his house and at the club shouting "Pete forever! Ringo never!"[50] Harrison received a black eye from one of the upset fans and Epstein, whose car tyres they had flattened in anger, temporarily hired a bodyguard to ensure his safety.[54]
Starr's first recording session as a member of the Beatles took place on 4 September 1962.[51] He stated that Martin had thought that he "was crazy and couldn't play ... because I was trying to play the percussion and the drums at the same time, we were just a four piece band".[55] For their second recording session with Starr, which took place on 11 September 1962, Martin replaced him with session drummer Andy White while recording takes for what would be the two sides of the Beatles' first single, "Love Me Do" backed with "P.S. I Love You".[56] Starr played tambourine on "Love Me Do" and maracas on "P.S. I Love You".[51] Concerned about his status in the Beatles, he thought: "That's the end, they're doing a Pete Best on me."[57] Martin later clarified: "I simply didn't know what Ringo was like and I wasn't prepared to take any risks."[58][nb 5]
By November 1962 Starr had been accepted by Beatles fans, who were now calling for him to sing songs.[59] Soon afterwards, he began receiving an amount of fanmail equal to that of the others, which helped to secure his position within the band.[60] Starr considered himself fortunate to be on the same "wavelength" as the other Beatles: "I had to be, or I wouldn't have lasted. I had to join them as people [sic] as well as a drummer."[61] He was given a small percentage of Lennon and McCartney's publishing company, Northern Songs, but he derived his primary income during this period from a one-quarter share of Beatles Ltd, a corporation financed by the band's net concert earnings.[60] He commented on the nature of his lifestyle after having achieved success with the Beatles: "I lived in nightclubs for three years. It used to be a non-stop party."[62] Like his father Starr became well known for his late-night dancing and he received considerable praise for his skills.[62]
During 1963, the Beatles enjoyed increasing popularity in England. In January, their second single, "Please Please Me" followed "Love Me Do" into the UK charts and a successful television appearance on Thank Your Lucky Stars earned them favourable reviews, leading to a boost in sales and radio play.[63] By the end of the year, the phenomenon known as Beatlemania had spread throughout the country, and by February 1964 the Beatles had become an international success, performing on The Ed Sullivan Show to a record 73 million viewers.[64] Starr commented: "In the states I know I went over well. It knocked me out to see and hear the kids waving for me. I'd made it as a personality ... Our appeal ... is that we're ordinary lads."[65] He was a source of inspiration for several songs written at the time, including Penny Valentine's "I Want to Kiss Ringo Goodbye" and Rolf Harris's "Ringo for President".[66] In 1964, "I love Ringo" lapel pins outsold all other Beatles merchandising.[66] During live performances, the Beatles continued the Starr Time routine that had been popular among his fans: Lennon would place a microphone in front of Starr's kit in preparation for his spotlight moment and audiences would erupt in screams.[67] When the Beatles made their film debut in A Hard Day's Night, Starr garnered much praise from critics, who considered both his delivery of deadpan one-liners and his non-speaking scenes highlights of the movie.[68] The extended non-speaking sequences had to be arranged by director Richard Lester due to Starr's lack of sleep the previous night, Starr commented: "Because I'd been drinking all night I was incapable of saying a line."[69] Epstein attributed Starr's acclaim to "the little man's quaintness".[70] After the release of the Beatles' second feature film, Help! (1965), Starr won a Melody Maker poll against his fellow Beatles for his performance as the central character in the film.[71]
During an interview with Playboy magazine in 1964, Lennon explained that Starr had filled-in with the Beatles when Best was ill; Starr replied: "[Best] took little pills to make him ill".[72] Soon after Starr made the comment, a provoked Best filed a libel suit against him that lasted for four years before the court reached an undisclosed settlement in Best's favour.[73] In June, the Beatles were scheduled to tour Denmark, the Netherlands, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, but Starr became ill the day before the start of the tour.[74] Stricken with a high-grade fever, pharyngitis and tonsillitis, he was admitted to a local hospital where he briefly stayed followed by several days of recuperation at home.[75] During this time, Starr was temporarily replaced for five concert dates by 24-year-old session drummer Jimmie Nicol.[76] Starr was discharged from the hospital, and he rejoined the band in Melbourne on 15 June.[77][nb 6] He later admitted that he feared he would be permanently replaced during his illness.[80] In August, when the Beatles were introduced to Bob Dylan, Starr was the first to try a cannabis cigarette offered to the band by Dylan, whereas Lennon, McCartney and Harrison were hesitant.[81]
On 11 February 1965, Starr married Maureen Cox, whom he had first met in 1962.[82] By this time the negative aspects of Beatlemania had reached a peak for him, who after having received a telephoned death threat before a show in Montreal resorted to positioning his cymbals vertically in an attempt to provide protection from would-be assassins. The constant pressure of the Beatles' fame impacted their live performances; Starr commented: "We were turning into such bad musicians ... there was no groove to it."[83] He was also feeling increasingly isolated from the musical activities of his bandmates, who were moving past the traditional boundaries of rock music into territory that often did not require his accompaniment; during recording sessions he spent countless hours playing cards with their road manager Neil Aspinall and roadie Mal Evans while the other Beatles perfected tracks without him.[84] In a letter published in Melody Maker, a fan asked the Beatles to let Starr sing more; he replied: "[I am] quite happy with my one little track on each album".[84]
In August 1966, the Beatles released Revolver, their seventh UK LP.[85] The album included the song "Yellow Submarine", which was the only British number one single with Starr as the lead singer.[86] Later that month and owing to the increasing pressures of touring, the Beatles gave their final concert, a 30-minute performance at San Francisco's Candlestick Park.[87] Starr commented: "We gave up touring at the right time. Four years of Beatlemania were enough for anyone."[88] By December, he had moved into an upscale estate on three acres in Saint George's Hill called Sunny Heights.[89] Although he had adorned the house with many of the finest luxuries available at the time, including numerous televisions, light machines, film projectors and stereo equipment, a billiard table, go-kart track and a bar named the Flying Cow, he did not include a drum kit, he explained: "When we don't record, I don't play".[90]
For the Beatles' seminal 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Starr sang lead vocals on the Lennon–McCartney composition "With a Little Help from My Friends".[91] Although the Beatles had enjoyed widespread commercial and critical success with Sgt. Pepper, the long hours they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr's increased feeling of alienation within the band, he commented: "[It] wasn't our best album. That was the peak for everyone else, but for me it was a bit like being a session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play."[92][nb 7] His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison.[94] During his down-time Starr worked on his guitar playing; he commented: "I jump into chords that no one seems to get into. Most of the stuff I write is twelve-bar".[95]
Epstein's death in August 1967 left the Beatles without management; Starr remarked: "[It was] a strange time for us, when it's someone who've relied on in the business, where we never got involved."[96] Soon afterwards, the band began an ill-fated film project, Magical Mystery Tour. Starr's growing interest in photography at the time lead to his billing as the movie's Director of Photography, and his participation in the film's editing was matched only by McCartney.[97]
In February 1968, Starr became the first Beatle to sing during another artist's show without the other three present. He sang the Buck Owens hit "Act Naturally", and performed a duet with Cilla Black, "Do you Like Me Just a Little Bit?" on her BBC One television programme, Cilla.[98] Later that year Apple Records released The Beatles, commonly known as the White Album.[99] Creative inspiration for the double-LP came in part from the band's recent interactions with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.[100] While attending an intermediate course at his ashram in Rishikesh, India, they enjoyed one of their most prolific writing periods, composing most of the album's songs there.[101] Despite leaving after ten days, Starr completed his first recorded Beatles song, "Don't Pass Me By", while in India.[102][nb 8] During the recording of the White Album, relations within the band became openly divisive.[105] As the sessions progressed, their collective group dynamic began to decay; at times only one or two Beatles were involved in the recording for a track.[106] Starr had grown weary of McCartney's increasingly overbearing approach and Lennon's passive-aggressive behaviour, which was exacerbated by Starr's resentment of Yoko Ono's near constant presence.[106] After one particularly difficult session during which McCartney had harshly criticised his drumming, he quit the band for two weeks, taking a holiday with his family in Sardinia on a boat loaned by Peter Sellers.[107] During a lunch break the chef served octopus, which Starr refused to eat. A subsequent conversation with the ship's captain regarding the behaviours of the animal served as the inspiration for his Abbey Road composition, "Octopus's Garden", which Starr wrote on guitar during the trip.[108] When he returned to the studio two weeks later, he discovered that his drum kit had been covered in flowers.[109]
Despite a temporary return to congenial relations during the completion of the White Album, production of the Beatles' fourth feature film, Let It Be, and its accompanying LP, strained an already tenuous cohesion within the band.[110] On 20 August 1969, the Beatles gathered for the final time at Abbey Road Studios for a mixing session for "I Want You (She's So Heavy)".[111] Following a business meeting on 20 September 1969, Lennon told the others that he had quit the Beatles.[112]
On 10 April 1970, McCartney publicly announced that he had quit the Beatles.[113] Starr released two albums before the end of that year: Sentimental Journey, a UK number seven hit composed of his renditions of many pre-rock standards that included musical arrangements by Quincy Jones, Maurice Gibb, George Martin and McCartney, and the country-inspired Beaucoups of Blues, engineered by Scotty Moore and featuring renowned Nashville session musician Pete Drake.[114]
Starr played drums on Lennon's John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), Ono's Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band (1970), and on Harrison's albums All Things Must Pass (1970) and Living in the Material World (1973).[115] In 1971, Starr participated in the Concert for Bangladesh, organised by Harrison, and with him co-wrote the hit single "It Don't Come Easy", which reached number four in both the US and the UK.[116] The following year he released his most successful UK hit, "Back Off Boogaloo", which peaked at number two (US number nine).[117] Later that year he made his directorial debut with the T. Rex documentary Born to Boogie.[118][nb 9] In 1973, he earned two number one hits in the US: "Photograph", a UK number eight hit that was co-written with Harrison, and "You're Sixteen", written by the Sherman Brothers.[119] Starr's third million-selling single and his second US chart-topper, "You're Sixteen" was released in the UK in February 1974 where it peaked at number four in the charts.[120]
In November 1973, Starr released Ringo, a commercially successful album produced by Richard Perry that featured writing and musical contributions from Harrison, Lennon and McCartney.[121] The LP yielded the hit song "Oh My My", a US number five that was Starr's fifth consecutive top-ten hit.[122] The album reached number seven in the UK and number two in the US.[123] Goodnight Vienna followed in 1974 and was also successful, reaching number eight in the US and number 30 in the UK.[124] The album earned Starr a pair of top-ten hits with his cover of the Platters' "Only You (And You Alone)", which peaked at number six in the US and number 28 in the UK, and "No No Song", which was a US number three and Starr's seventh consecutive top-ten hit.[125][nb 10] During this period he became romantically involved with Lynsey de Paul.[127] He played tambourine on a song she wrote and produced for Vera Lynn, "Don't You Remember When", and he inspired another De Paul song, "If I Don't Get You the Next One Will", which she described as being about revenge after he missed a dinner appointment with her because he was asleep in his office.[127]
Starr founded the record label Ring O'Records in 1975.[128] The company signed eleven artists and released fifteen singles and five albums between 1975 and 1978, including works by David Hentschel, Graham Bonnet and Rab Noakes.[129] The commercial impact of Starr's recording career subsequently diminished, although he continued to record and remained a familiar celebrity presence. In 1976, Polydor Records released Ringo's Rotogravure, an album that featured compositions by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison.[130] Although the album and its accompanying singles failed to chart in the UK, the LP produced two minor US hits, "A Dose of Rock 'n' Roll" (number 26) and a cover of "Hey! Baby" (number 74), and achieved moderate sales, reaching a chart position of 28.[131] This inspired Polydor to revamp Starr's formula; the results were a curious blend of disco and 1970s pop, Ringo the 4th (1977).[132] The album was a commercial disaster, failing to chart in the UK and peaking at number 162 in the US.[133] In 1978 Starr released Bad Boy; the album reached a disappointing number 129 in the US and failed to chart in the UK.[134]
Following Lennon's murder in 1980, Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had originally written for Starr, "All Those Years Ago", as a tribute to their former bandmate.[135] The track, which included vocal contributions from both Paul and Linda McCartney and Starr's original drum part, peaked at number two in the US charts, and number 13 in the UK.[136][nb 11] In 1981, Starr released Stop and Smell the Roses.[138] The LP contained the Harrison composition "Wrack My Brain", which reached number 38 in the US charts, but failed to chart in the UK.[139] Lennon had offered a pair of songs for use on the album: "Nobody Told Me" and "Life Begins at 40", but following his death, Starr did not feel comfortable recording them.[138] Soon after the murder, Starr and his girlfriend Barbara Bach flew to New York City to be with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono.[140]
From 1984 to 1986, Starr narrated the children's series Thomas & Friends, a Britt Allcroft production based on the books by the Reverend W. Awdry.[141] Starr also portrayed the character Mr. Conductor in the programme's American spin-off Shining Time Station, which debuted in 1989 on PBS. He left after the first season.[142] In 1985, he performed with his son Zak as part of Artists United Against Apartheid on the recording, Sun City.[143] In 1987 Starr played drums on the song "When We Was Fab", from Harrison's album Cloud Nine.[144] The song, which was co-written by Harrison and Jeff Lynne, charted in the top 30 in both the UK and the US.[145] The same year, Starr, Harrison and Lynne joined Eric Clapton, Elton John, Phil Collins and Ray Cooper in a performance for the Prince's Trust charity.[146]
During October and November 1988, Starr and Bach attended a detox clinic in Tucson, Arizona, each receiving a six-week treatment for alcoholism.[147][nb 12] On 23 July 1989, Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band gave their first performance to an audience of ten thousand in Dallas, Texas.[149] The band consisted of Starr and a varying assortment of musicians who had been successful in their own right with popular songs at different times.[150] The concerts interchanged Starr's singing, including selections of his Beatles and solo songs, with performances of each of the other artists' well-known material, the latter incorporating either Starr or another musician as drummer.[150]
The first All-Starr excursion led to the release of Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band (1990), a compilation of live performances from the tour.[151] In the same year, Starr recorded a version of the song "I Call Your Name" for a television special marking the 10th anniversary of John Lennon's death and the 50th anniversary of Lennon's birth. The track, produced by Lynne, features a supergroup composed of Lynne, Tom Petty, Joe Walsh and Jim Keltner.[152]
The following year, Starr made a cameo appearance on The Simpsons episode "Brush with Greatness" and contributed an original song, "You Never Know", to the soundtrack of the John Hughes film Curly Sue.[153] In 1992, Starr released his first studio album in nine years, Time Takes Time, which was produced by Phil Ramone, Don Was, Lynne and Peter Asher and featured guest appearances by various stars including Brian Wilson and Harry Nilsson.[154] In 1994, Starr began a collaboration with the surviving former Beatles for the Beatles Anthology project. They recorded two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon and gave lengthy interviews about the Beatles' career.[155] Released in December 1995, "Free as a Bird" was the first new Beatles single since 1970.[156] In March 1996, they released a second single, "Real Love". Harrison refused to participate in the completion of a third song.[157]
Starr guested on two songs from McCartney's 1997 album, Flaming Pie. McCartney had written a song about Starr's ex-wife Maureen, who died in 1994, called "Little Willow" and asked Starr if he would play on another song, "Beautiful Night".[158] The day after the "Beautiful Night" session, the two recorded a jam session, which developed into another song, "Really Love You", notable for being the first official release ever credited to McCartney/Starkey.[159] In 1998, he released two albums on the Mercury label. The studio album Vertical Man marked the beginning of a nine-year partnership with Mark Hudson, who produced the album and, with his band the Roundheads, formed the core of the backing group for the album. In addition, many famous guests joined on various tracks, including Martin, McCartney and, in his final appearance on a Starr album, Harrison. Most of the songs were written by Starr and the band. Joe Walsh and the Roundheads joined Starr for his appearance on VH1 Storytellers, which was released as an album under the same name. During the show, he performed greatest hits and new songs and told anecdotes relating to them.[160]
Starr was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 2002, joining an elite group including Buddy Rich and William F. Ludwig, Sr. and Jr.[161] On 29 November 2002 (the first anniversary of Harrison's death), Starr performed "Photograph" and a cover of Carl Perkins' "Honey Don't" at the Concert for George held in the Royal Albert Hall, London.[162] In 2003, Starr formed Pumkinhead Records with All-Starr Band member Mark Hudson.[163] The label was not prolific, but their first signing was Liam Lynch, who produced a 2003 LP entitled Fake Songs.[164]
Starr served as an honorary Santa Tracker and voice-over personality in 2003 and 2004 during the London stop in Father Christmas's annual Christmas Eve journey, as depicted in the annual NORAD tracks Santa program. According to NORAD officials, he was "a Starr in the east" who helped guide North American Aerospace Defense Command's Santa-tracking tradition.[165]
In 2005, Liverpool's City Council announced plans to demolish Starr's birthplace, 9 Madryn Street, stating that it had "no historical significance".[166] The LCC later announced that the building would be taken apart brick by brick and preserved.[167]
Starr released Liverpool 8 in 2008, an album produced by Dave Stewart, Mark Hudson and Starr. Hudson was the initial producer of the recordings but was replaced by Stewart after a falling out with Starr. According to the journalist Peter Palmiere, the partnership between Hudson and Starr ended because of Starr's insistence on using synthesised sounds, for which Stewart is known, whereas Hudson wanted real guitars, pianos and strings.[168][nb 13] On 10 October 2008, Starr posted a video on his website stating that he would not be signing autographs after 20 October 2008. He stated that he is too busy and that anything after that date sent to any address will not be signed.[169]
On 4 April 2009, Starr reunited with McCartney at the David Lynch "Change Begins Within" Benefit Concert at Radio City Music Hall. After separate performances from Starr and other artists, McCartney's set came last, and towards the end he announced "Billy Shears", whereupon Starr joined him to perform "With a Little Help from My Friends" and, with all performers, "I Saw Her Standing There" and "Cosmically Conscious".[170]
Starr appeared on-stage during Microsoft's June 2009 E3 press conference with Yoko Ono, McCartney and Olivia Harrison to promote The Beatles: Rock Band video game.[171] In November 2009, Starr once again performed the voice of Thomas the Tank Engine for "The Official BBC Children in Need Medley". This is the first number 1 UK hit Starr has been involved in since the Beatles disbanded in 1970 (not counting guest appearances on other singles by other artists).[172]
In 2010 Starr self-produced and released his fifteenth studio album, Y Not, which included the track "Walk with You" and featured a vocal contribution from McCartney.[173] Later that year, he appeared during Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief as a celebrity phone operator.[174] On 7 July 2010, Starr celebrated his 70th birthday at Radio City Music Hall, New York with another All-Starr Band concert, topped with friends and family joining him on stage including Yoko Ono and his son Zak: McCartney made a surprise appearance.[175]
Starr recorded a cover of Buddy Holly's "Think It Over" for the tribute album Listen to Me: Buddy Holly, which was released on 6 September 2011.[176] On 30 January 2012, he released the album Ringo 2012. Later that year, Starr announced that his All-Starr Band would tour the Pacific Rim during 2013 with select dates in New Zealand, Australia and Japan; it would be his first performance in Japan since 1996, and his debut in both New Zealand and Australia.[177] In January 2014, Starr reunited with Paul McCartney for a special performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards performing the song "Queenie Eye" at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles.[178]
During his youth, Starr had been a devoted fan of skiffle and blues music, but by the time he joined the Texans in 1958, he had developed a preference for rock and roll.[179] He was also influenced by country artists, including Hank Williams, Buck Owens and Hank Snow, and jazz drummers such as Chico Hamilton and Yusef Lateef, whose compositional style inspired Starr's fluid and energetic drum fills and grooves.[180] While reflecting on Buddy Rich, Starr commented: "He does things with one hand that I can't do with nine, but that's technique. Everyone I talk to says 'What about Buddy Rich?' Well, what about him? Because he doesn't turn me on."[181] He stated that he "was never really into drummers", but identified Cozy Cole's 1958 cover of Benny Goodman's "Topsy Part Two" as "the one drum record" he bought.[182]
Starr's first musical hero was Gene Autry, about whom he commented: "I remember getting shivers up my back when he sang, "South of the Border".[183] By the early 1960s he had become an ardent fan of Lee Dorsey.[184] In November 1964, Starr told Melody Maker: "Our music is second-hand versions of negro music ... Ninety per cent of the music I like is coloured."[185]
While Starr has acknowledged the technical limitations of his drumming for the Beatles, the overall effect of his contribution has received high praise from notable drummers. Starr commented: "I'm no good on the technical things ... I'm your basic offbeat drummer with funny fills ... because I'm really left-handed playing a right-handed kit. I can't roll around the drums because of that."[186] Beatles producer George Martin stated: "Ringo hit good and hard and used the tom-tom well, even though he couldn't do a roll to save his life", although Martin later added, "He's got tremendous feel. He always helped us to hit the right tempo for a song, and gave it that support – that rock-solid back-beat – that made the recording of all the Beatles' songs that much easier."[186] Starr commented: "I've always believed that the drummer is not there to interpret the song", comparing his drumming to painting, he stated: "I am the foundation, and then I put a bit of glow here and there ... If there's a gap, I want to be good enough to fill it."[181]
In 2011, readers of Rolling Stone magazine voted Starr as the fifth-greatest drummer of all time.[187] Journalist Robyn Flans, a long-time contributor with Modern Drummer magazine, writing for the Percussive Arts Society stated: "I cannot count the number of drummers who have told me that Ringo inspired their passion for drums".[3] Drummer Steve Smith commented on Starr's musical contribution:
Before Ringo, drum stars were measured by their soloing ability and virtuosity. Ringo's popularity brought forth a new paradigm in how the public saw drummers. We started to see the drummer as an equal participant in the compositional aspect. One of Ringo's great qualities was that he composed unique, stylistic drum parts for the Beatles' songs. His parts are so signature to the songs that you can listen to a Ringo drum part without the rest of the music and still identify the song.[3]
Starr influenced Phil Collins,[188] the drummer for Genesis, who said: "Starr is vastly underrated. The drum fills on the song "A Day in the Life" are very complex things. You could take a great drummer today and say, 'I want it like that.' He wouldn't know what to do."[189] In September 1980, Lennon told Rolling Stone:
Ringo was a star in his own right in Liverpool before we even met. Ringo was a professional drummer who sang and performed and was in one of the top groups in Britain, but especially in Liverpool. So Ringo's talent would have come out one way or the other ... whatever that spark is in Ringo, we all know it but can't put our finger on it. Whether it's acting, drumming, or singing, I don't know. There's something in him that is projectable and he would have surfaced as an individual ... Ringo is a damn good drummer.[190]
In his extensive survey of the Beatles' recording sessions, historian Mark Lewisohn confirmed that Starr was both proficient and remarkably reliable and consistent. According to Lewisohn, there were fewer than a dozen occasions in the Beatles' eight-year recording career where session breakdowns were caused by Starr making a mistake, while the vast majority of takes were stopped owing to mistakes by the other three Beatles.[191] Starr is considered to have influenced various modern drumming techniques, such as the matched grip, tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings, as well as placing the drums on high risers for visibility as part of the band.[3] According to Ken Micallef and Donnie Marshall, co-authors of Classic Rock Drummers: "Ringo's fat tom sounds and delicate cymbal work were imitated by thousands of drummers."[192]
Starr sang lead vocals for a song on most of the Beatles' studio albums as part of an attempt to establish a vocal personality for each band member. In many cases, Lennon or McCartney wrote the lyrics and melody especially for him, as they did for "Yellow Submarine" from Revolver and "With a Little Help from My Friends" on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.[193] These melodies were tailored to Starr's limited baritone vocal range. Starr's backing vocals are heard on songs such as "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" and "Carry That Weight".[194] He is also the lead vocalist on his compositions "Don't Pass Me By" and "Octopus's Garden".[195] In addition, he also sang lead on "I Wanna Be Your Man", "Boys", "Matchbox", "Honey Don't", "Act Naturally", "Good Night" and "What Goes On".[196]
Starr's idiosyncratic turns of phrase, or Ringoisms as they became known, such as a hard day's night and tomorrow never knows, were used as song titles by the Beatles, particularly by Lennon.[197] McCartney commented: "Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic".[198] As well as inspiring his bandmates' creativity in this way, Starr occasionally contributed lyrics to unfinished Lennon–McCartney songs, such as the line "darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there" from "Eleanor Rigby".[199]
Starr is credited as a co-writer of "What Goes On", "Flying" and "Dig It".[200][nb 14] On material issued after the break-up, Starr received a writing credit for "Taking a Trip to Carolina" and received joint songwriting credits with the other three Beatles for "12-Bar Original", "Los Paranoias", "Christmas Time (Is Here Again)", "Suzy Parker", heard in the Let It Be film, and "Jessie's Dream", from the Magical Mystery Tour film.[202]
When Starr married Maureen in 1965, Beatles manager Brian Epstein served as best-man, with Starr's step-father Harry Graves and fellow Beatle George Harrison as witnesses.[203] Soon afterwards, the couple's matrimony became the subject of a US novelty song, "Treat Him Tender, Maureen", by the Chicklettes.[204] Starr and Maureen had three children together: Zak (born 13 September 1965), Jason (born 19 August 1967) and Lee (born 11 November 1970).[205] In 1971, Starr purchased Lennon's former home, Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire and moved his family there.[206] Following Starr's repeated infidelities, the couple divorced in 1975.[207] Maureen died from leukaemia in 1994.[208]
In 1980, while on the set of the film Caveman, Starr met actress Barbara Bach; they were married on 27 April 1981.[209] In 1985, he was the first of the Beatles to become a grandfather upon the birth of Zak's daughter, Tatia Jayne Starkey.[210] Zak Starkey is also a drummer, and during his father's regular absences, he spent time with the Who's Keith Moon.[211] Zak has performed with his father during some All-Starr Band tours.[212]
Starr and Bach split their time between homes in Cranleigh, Surrey; Los Angeles; and Monte Carlo.[213] In the Sunday Times Rich List 2011, Starr was listed at number 56 with an estimated personal wealth of £150m.[214] In 2012, Starr was estimated to be the wealthiest drummer in the world.[215]
During the 1965 Birthday Honours for Queen Elizabeth II, Starr and the other Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE); they received their insignia from the Queen at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October.[216] He and the other Beatles were cumulatively nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer for their performances in the 1964 film A Hard Day's Night.[217] In 1971, the Beatles received an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be.[218] In 1988, the Beatles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[219] During the 50th Grammy Awards, Starr, George Martin and his son Giles accepted the Best Compilation Soundtrack award for Love. On 9 November 2008, Starr accepted a Diamond Award on behalf of the Beatles during the 2008 World Music Awards ceremony in Monaco.
The minor planet 4150 Starr, discovered on 31 August 1984 by Brian A. Skiff at the Anderson Mesa Station of the Lowell Observatory, was named in Starr's honour.[220] Starr was nominated for a 1989 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in a Children's Series for his role as Mr. Conductor in the television series Shining Time Station.[221] On 8 February 2010, he was honoured with the 2,401st star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. It is located at 1750 North Vine Street, in front of the Capitol Records building, as are the stars for Lennon, McCartney and Harrison.[222] He became Commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2013.[223]
Starr has received praise from critics and movie industry professionals regarding his acting; director and producer Walter Shenson called him "a superb actor, an absolute natural."[69] By the mid-1960s, Starr had become a connoisseur of film.[224] In addition to his roles in A Hard Day's Night (1964), Help! (1965), Magical Mystery Tour (1967), Yellow Submarine (1968) and Let It Be (1970), Starr also acted in Candy (1968), The Magic Christian (1969), Blindman (1971), Son of Dracula (1974) and Caveman (1981).[225] In 1971, he starred as Larry the Dwarf in Frank Zappa's 200 Motels and was featured in Harry Nilsson's animated film The Point![226] He co-starred in That'll Be the Day (1973) as a Teddy Boy and appeared in The Last Waltz, the Martin Scorsese documentary film about the 1976 farewell concert of the Band.[227]
Starr played The Pope in Ken Russell's Lisztomania (1975), and a fictionalised version of himself in McCartney's Give My Regards to Broad Street in 1984.[228] Starr appeared as himself and a downtrodden alter-ego Ognir Rrats in Ringo (1978), an American-made television comedy film based loosely on The Prince and the Pauper.[229] For the 1979 documentary film on the Who, The Kids Are Alright, Starr appeared in interview segments with fellow drummer Keith Moon.[230]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Ringo Starr is a British musician, actor, director, writer, and artist best known as the drummer of The Beatles who also coined the title 'A Hard day's Night' for The Beatles' first movie.He was born Richard Starkey on July 7, 1940, in a small two-storey house in the working class area of Liverpool, Merseyside, England. His father, Richard Starkey, was a former dockworker turned baker; his mother, Elsie Starkey, was a bakery worker. His parents divorced when he was three and he and his mother, Elsie, moved to another home in Liverpool. While attending Silas Infants' Schools he suffered from many afflictions that basically ruined his education: he had constant abdominal pains, was once diagnosed with a ruptured appendix that led to an inflamed peritoneum, which also led to one of his first surgeries. Ringo was in a coma, and his recovery took a couple of months, during which more operations were performed, and he was known to be accident-prone. Shortly after he came out of the coma, he was trying to offer a toy bus to another boy in an adjoining bed, but fell and suffered from a concussion. When he finally was able to go back to school, he learned that he was far behind in his studies. At age 13 he caught a cold that turned into chronic pleurisy, causing him another stay at a hospital in Liverpool. A few lung complications followed, which resulted in a treatment in yet another children's hospital, this time until 1955. Meanwhile, Richard's mother Elsie had married Harry Graves, the man who her son referred to as a "step-ladder".At the age of 15 he could barely read or write, although he had aptitude for practical subjects such as woodwork and mechanics. At that time he dropped out of school and got his first job was as a delivery boy for British Rail. His second job was a barman on a ferry to New Brighton, and his next was as a trainee joiner at Henry Hunt & Sons. Ringo injured his finger on the first day of his new job, and then he decided to become a drummer. His dream came true, when his stepfather bought him a new drum kit, and Richard promised to be the best drummer ever.In 1957, together with Eddie Miles, he started his own band called 'Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group'. At that time he became known as Ritchie, and eventually became caught in the Liverpool's Skiffle craze. Although he was self-taught, he was a good time-keeper, and developed an original beat with his signature accentuations, due to his left-handed manner of playing on the right-handed drum set. He traveled from band to band, but he eventually landed a spot with "Raving Texans", which was a backing band for Rory Storm, later known as "Rory Storm & The Hurricanes", a popular band at that time Liverpool. Rory Storm encouraged Richard to enhance his career by legally changing his name to Ringo Starr. The Hurricanes topped the bill at one of Liverpool's clubs, where The Beatles also had a gig. Ringo's group was at times sharing popularity with The Beatles and Gerry and the Pacemakers. He wanted to leave The Hurricanes to join another group called "The Seniors."Before Ringo, The Beatles tried several other drummers. At one point they were so desperate, that they even invited strangers from the audience to fill the position. Then came Pete Best who was not considered by the other band members to be the greatest drummer, and they were keen to recruit Ringo as his replacement. On June 6, 1962, at the Abbey Road studios, The Beatles passed Martin's audition with the exception of Pete Best. George Martin liked them, but recommended the change of a drummer. Being asked by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison; Epstein fired Pete Best. After a mutual decision the band was completed with Ringo Starr. Ringo contributed to their first hit in September of 1962, when The Beatles recorded Love Me Do, which charted in UK, and reached the top of the US singles chart.Ringo's steady and reliable drumming became essential in their studio sessions, as well as in their numerous and exhausting live performances across the world. Ringo's positive disposition as well as his drumming style played the pivotal role in shaping the famous image and music style of The Beatles as they are now known to the world, under the management of Brian Epstein and music producer George Martin. Ringo filled the position of a drummer for The Beatles in the most critical time of the band's formation. He quickly connected with the other three members of The Beatles, and contributed to their music and creativity with his easy-going personality, light humour, reliable drumming and inventive musicianship. All four members were charismatic and individually talented artists, they sparked each other from the beginning. Eventually they made a much better group effort under the thorough management by Brian Epstein whose coaching helped consolidate their talents and mutual stimulation into beautiful teamwork.Starr had dreamed of becoming a professional actor since his younger years. He wanted to be in movies probably more so than the other members of The Beatles. In 1964, during the first months of Beatlemania, Ringo coined the phrase 'A Hard Day's Night' which soon became the official title of the Beatles' first movie, in replacement for the working title 'Beatlemania'. Ringo received great reviews for his performance in A Hard Day's Night (1964) and Help! (1965). At first, Ringo did not have a songwriting career, although he had no problem with his name recognition, however, he had a problem with getting his songs noticed. At that time he got help from his friends; John and Paul wrote a song or two for him to sing on their albums, such as "Boys", "I Wanna Be Your Man", "Honey Don't", and "Yellow Submarine". During his eight-year career with The Beatles, Ringo wrote two original songs: "Don't Pass Me By" and "Octopus' Garden" for which he also sang the lead vocals. Besides his drumming, Ringo's voice was recorded on many of the most popular Beatle's songs, contributing to their unique sound and tight harmonies.He had a hectic solo career during the 1970s, after the breakup of The Beatles. However, Ringo eventually emerged as a steady performer, and sustained a very popular solo career, turning out a dozen chart-topping hit songs and eight best-selling albums. He made a famous appearance together with George Harrison, Ravi Shankar, and other popular musicians in the landmark 'Concert for Bangladesh' in 1971. His 1973 solo release "Ringo" was the last album to feature all four living Beatles, although not on the same song. He also appeared in various TV shows, including his own special, Ringo (1978), and a TV mini-series, Princess Daisy (1983), with his wife Barbara. In 1984 he did narration for the children's series Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends (1984). During the 1980s, after having a long period of troubles with alcohol, Ringo and his wife attended a rehabilitation clinic, and came back to the scene sober. He made the All-Starr Band tour of America and Japan. The tour was so popular that he formed another All-Starr Band lineup in 1992, and began an American and European tour in June of that year. Since then Ringo Starr has been enjoying a continuous career as the leader of the All-Starr Band. In 1994, along with George Harrison and Paul McCartney, the three surviving members of The Beatles, reunited and produced Lennon's previously unknown song 'Free as a Bird'. It was preserved by 'Yoko Ono' on a tape recording made by John Lennon in 1977. The song was re-arranged and re-mixed with the voices of three surviving members, and became an international hit. 'Free as a Bird' was also included in The Beatles Anthology TV documentary which was watched by 420 million people in 1995. Ringo, Paul and George sang their new songs, in addition to mixing their voices and music arrangements to John Lennon demos.Ringo's old friend and band-mate George Harrison passed away on November 29, 2001, after a long battle against lung cancer. The following year, on the anniversary of Harrison's death, Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton appeared in a Concert For George, to raise money for the support of Harrison's legacy in exploration of alternative lifestyles, views and philosophies. Starr also supported charitable organizations with consideration to those who have special needs.Ringo Starr updated the role of a drummer in popular music, he made drummer an equal partner to the lead musicians, thus changing the whole paradigm in how the public saw drummers. His original performing style evolved from adjusting his natural left-handed manner of playing to the right-handed drum set, and allowing his left hand lead in weaving a pattern tightly intertwined with the music of other players, and adding such enhancements as unusual accents and stops. Ringo's musical originality as well as his inventive drumming patterns, time signatures and accentuations became essential to the sound of The Beatles. His on-stage presence and acting talent as well as his humor and musicianship was the essential part in formation and remarkable career of The Beatles.He was married to his long-time girlfriend, Maureen Cox, from 1965 - 1975, and they had three children: Zak Starkey, Jason, and Lee. The couple broke up in July of 1975, and he married actress Barbara Bach. Ringo Starr divides his time between his residences in England, in Switzerland and his home in Los Angeles, California.
      He had three children with Maureen Starkey: Sons Zak Starkey (a featured drummer with The Who) and Jason (born August 19th 1967) and daughter Lee (born November 17th 1970).
The Beatles had several drummers before Starr joined. Pete Best had been with them for two years, when he was fired after failing the band's audition for George Martin at EMI.
      He is three months older than John Lennon, who founded The Beatles, and the last to join the group, technically making him both the oldest and youngest Beatle.
      He and the other Beatles were awarded MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) in the 1965 Queen's Birthday Honours List for their services to music. John Lennon returned his MBE in protest in 1969 for the Vietnam War. Paul McCartney was awarded Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire in the 1997 Queen's New Years Honours List for his services to music.
      Though Paul McCartney is the most successful ex-Beatle, Ringo actually had more solo US Top ten hits. (McCartney performed most of his Top Tens with Wings).
      Born and grew up in the Dingles section of Liverpool, England. Attended St. Silas School and Dingles Secondary Modern School.
      Before becoming an official member of The Beatles in 1962, he played many gigs with them, guesting when Pete Best was not available. Also made one recording with them, backing a singer named Wally, before he joined.
      A single of his, "The No-No Song", was a song against drug abuse. But in a darkly ironic note, the song was banned from several radio stations because of the drug references.
      Wrote the song "Octopus's Garden" while on vacation. He claims to have got the idea for the song after conversing with a chef about octopi.
      In the mid-1970s he was involved with British singer-songwriter Lynsey De Paul and appeared on a single she wrote for Dame Vera Lynn.
      Got the last name "Starr" from his birth name, Starkey. He got "Ringo" because he liked to wear rings on all his fingers.
      "Ringo Starr" was a natural stage name for a young man who'd grown up loving Western movies (he particularly admired Gene Autry, the "singing cowboy"). Considered moving to Texas, before joining The Beatles.
      Bought Tittenhurst Park estate from John Lennon (Lennon's last English home), when John and Yoko Ono decided to move to America; the deal came complete with Ascot Sound Studios, located on the grounds, and home of several albums ("Plastic Ono Band", "Imagine", and "Fly"). He renamed the facility Startling Studios. Judas Priest planned to record their "British Steel" album there, but preferred the acoustics of the house itself (which they had leased).
      Got his first set of drums as a present from his stepfather, who brought them back from London. Was able to turn professional with a £25 loan from his grandfather Starkey to make a deposit on a better drum set.
      Missed several years of school, because of illness growing up. Learned to read and write with the help of a neighbor girl, who became his babysitter.
      Was the only member of The Beatles to willingly accept Yoko Ono in John's life (and consequently theirs); he offered them the use of his London apartment, while John and Cynthia Lennon settled their divorce. Yoko tried to return Ringo's kindness over the years, and years later, when John was murdered, Ringo and future wife Barbara Bach flew to New York, to keep Yoko company.
      According to George Harrison, Starr unintentionally inspired a number of songs by his witty off-the-cuff remarks. For example, after a long session on The Beatles first film, he was heard to say, "It's been a hard day's night." That was approved by the studio as the title of the film and subsequently the song, "A Hard Day's Night". John Lennon affirmed this in his 1980 Playboy interview, mentioning that "Ringo-isms" had supplied the titles of "A Hard Day's Night" and "Tomorrow Never Knows".
      He is a longtime fan of the comedy troupe Monty Python, and even appeared on an episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969)..
      In 1985 he accepted the role of Locke Walls on The Guiding Light (1952) but pulled out at the last minute. The role was recast with Jeremy Slate
      Was the first member of The Beatles to "drop out" of their visit to India in the spring of 1968, to study with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Despite packing some home comforts (like cans of baked beans), he couldn't handle the spicy cooking the camp offered, and was missing his family.
The Beatles were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame for their outstanding contribution to British music and integral part of British music culture. [November 2004]
      The first song he sang with The Beatles, as far as actual album cuts go, was a cover of The Shirelles' classic "Boys".
      The first song he had a hand in writing for an album by The Beatles was "What Goes On", from the 1965 "Rubber Soul" album (which he co-wrote with John Lennon and Paul McCartney). He began his own first song "Don't Pass Me By" years earlier, but it did not appear until 1968's "White Album".
      Two of his biggest solo hits, "It Don't Come Easy" and "Photograph", featured ex-bandmate George Harrison on guitar and backing vocals.
      Stop and Smell the Roses was engineered and mixed by Bruce Robb in association with Bruce Robb Productions.
      He and the Beatles were awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Recording at 7080 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California.
      During April 1963 Ringo purchased a slightly used drum kit at "Drum City" a local outlet. In exchange for payment, Brian Epstein agreed to paste the distributor's "dropped T" logo as well as the manufacturer's name, "Ludwig " on the drum. The logo, the "large T" in Beatles, was adopted into their trade mark in 1969.
      While recording "Stop and Smell the Roses" at Cherokee Studios, he was joined by two former Beatles and their wives. John Lennon and Yoko Ono, as well as Paul and Linda McCartney came into Cherokee to collaborate with Ringo on the solo album. Ronnie Wood from the Rolling Stones also collaborated, adding guitar, bass, saxophone, keyboards, and back-up vocals.
      First of The Beatles to become a grandfather upon the birth of son Zak's daughter, Tatia Jayne Starkey.
      Was originally hired as a Beatle for a salary of £25 a week, with the promise of a full partnership in the band in time. The promise was kept, and after the Beatles began to have hit records, Starr's mother discovered the top of his dresser covered with money (wondering at first if it was all come by honestly), and opened a savings account for him. Nonetheless, Starr's initial £25 salary was never discontinued, and he would pick it up every week from NEMS (Brian Epstein's management company). He used it for pocket money.
      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles, California for his services and contributions to the Recording Industry.
      In his time as a Beatle, Starr single-handedly consolidated "Ludwig" as the drum set of choice among popular bands of his era.
      Starr mystified many of his contemporaries with his practice of draping light towels over his snare drum in order to deaden the characteristic timbre of his instrument. He famously removed the front skin of his bass drum and stuffed the cavity with cushions to deepen the punch of the bass sound.
      Starr cites drummers Jim Keltner and Cozy Cole as major influences on his career as The Beatles' drummer. Starr and Keltner performed as a team at The Concert for Bangladesh (1972), and Keltner played drums on Starr's "Rotogravure" album.
      Friends with Keith Moon. The two shared a house in California in the mid-1970s with John Lennon and Harry Nilsson, while they worked on each other's records.
Phil Collins states Ringo as his biggest influence as a drummer and songs such as "That's All" (by Genesis), "Thru' These Walls" and "We Said Hello Goodbye" deliberately copied Ringo's style of drumming.
      While he owns property in several countries, he is officially a British citizen residing in Monaco.
      [about his early drumming years with The Beatles] I started to be an engineer but I banged me thumb on the first day. I became a drummer because it was the only thing I could do. But whenever I hear another drummer I know I'm no good. [John Lennon] taught me the song I sing. I can only play on the off beat because John can't keep up on the rhythm guitar. I'm no good on the technical things but I'm good with all the motions, swinging my head, like. That's because I love to dance but you can't do that on the drums. I figure we're good for another four years. I don't want to invest me money in stocks or anything. I just want to have it and draw 20 or 30 quid a week. The main thing is, I don't ever want to go back to work.
      [on meeting Elvis Presley in 1965] The saddest part is that, years and years later, we found out that he tried to have us banished from America, because he was very big with the FBI. That's very sad to me, that he felt so threatened that he thought, like a lot of people, that we were bad for American youth. This is Mr. Hips, the man, and he felt we were a danger. I think that the danger was mainly to him and his career.
      I don't like talking. It's how I'm built. Some people gab all day and some play it smogo. I don't mind talking or smiling, it's just I don't do it very much. I haven't got a smiling face or a talking mouth.
      [on is marriage to Maureen Cox] She's just sort of ordinary, she's from Liverpool. And the genuine fans wrote in saying, you know, "If you are going with her, good luck and I hope you're happy".
      I remember the day Zak was born. It was the first time I'd felt totally useless. There was Maureen having our baby. She kept on crying "Help!" and I kept asking "How?"
      I've never been able to sit round on my own and play drums, practice in the back room, never been able to. I've always played with other musicians. It's how I play, there's no joy for me in playing on my own, bashing away. I need a bass, a piano, guitar, whatever, and then I can play.
      I think the most exciting thing is that you expect people our age to know the music, but actually a lot of kids know the music, and if anything is left, we have left really good music, and that's the important part, not the mop-tops or whatever.
      I never studied anything, really. I didn't study the drums. I joined bands and made all the mistakes onstage.
      We were the first generation that didn't go into the army. I missed the call up by, like, 10 months, and so we were allowed, as these teenagers, not to be regimented and turn into these musicians.
      I'm probably the best rock 'n' roll drummer on earth. I say that now because I used to be embarrassed to speak up for myself.
      ... [Beatlemania]'s always on. There's nothing we can do about that. What's more interesting to me is that our records are still coming out. And they're the same records and the new generation gets to hear them, and as far as that's concerned, that's the most important thing to me. The music we make, it's still going on.
      ... it's well-documented, in 1964 that old Bill Ludwig, he presented it to me. I bought these Ludwig drums, and in the shop in England, the guy wanted to take the sign out, but I love everything American, the music and the instruments. So I made him leave the sign on. So I was a running commercial - on Sullivan [The Toast of the Town_], and all that touring of America, it said Ludwig drums.
      [on age 70]: As far as I'm concerned, in my head, I'm 24. That's just how it is. The number, yeah, it's high. But I just felt I've got to celebrate it. I'm on my feet and I'm doing what I love to do, and I'm in a profession, as a musician, where we can go on for as long as we can go on. I'm not hiding from it, you know.
      Now I've realised to make the music I like there's no real reason to go to a studio. The other day, we were downloading an Echoplex machine and you just download the damn thing! I've been through quite a lot of technology, you know, but... I have two bits of wood in my hand and I hit those buggers and I love it!
      My stepdad was great, he taught me about Sarah Vaughan, Billy Eckstine, people like that. I learnt all the music I had from Bill Haley in 1954, Frankie Laine and on.
      When I started, there was rock, there was pop, there was country. That was about all. And now it's divided into 30 categories. Now I don't know one from the other. (Speaking in 2011)
      The '70s wasn't bad. I thought the '80s was all synthesised, even the drums, and there were weird people playing the drums.
      We've known Bob (Bob Dylan) since the early '60s and if he's playing LA, I go and see him. It's just one of those things. He is a giant in my mind.
      I bought one record once because of the drums, and that was Cozy Cole doing "Topsy". But all the records I bought were for the whole record. It's not like I was searching out drummers and that. Al Jackson was great, of course. It's always been the whole band and the singer that's really excited me.
      I had this dream at 13 to play drums, nothing else, play drums. And when I got to play the drums, when I finally got a set when I was nearly 18, I wanted to play with good people and I started playing with the best band at the time, and then the next best band and then the biggest band, the best band of all. That's how it's always worked for me. I just wanna play, I wanna support the band. I love the band mentality. I love playing with other musicians. I'm not the one who can sit in the back room and practise, but if you can play piano and guitar I'll play with you all night. I don't like it as a solo gig, where you're just banging away. That's why I never did drum solos, there's really no need for them.
      I don't want to go back anywhere. I want to deal with what's in front of me now to the best of my abilities, and sometimes that's not very good. But a lot of the days it is really great.
      I love the modern technology now. I was a little opposed to it -'Oh, in my day, we used to have a donkey turning the wheel, and two guys chewing tape to make it soft.'
      [on downloading individual songs] It's a different time, and I'm afraid to say that's what I do. If you made a record, I'd probably pick out tracks that I like and download that. That's just how it is. We have to go with that because it's changed.
      [on filming _Let It Be_ in 1969]: The police came to stop us, and I was on the roof: 'Come on, drag me off!' It would be so dramatic, and the damn cop wouldn't drag me off!
      [in 2012] I've been asked to write an autobiography of myself, but they really only want those eight years. And I say, 'But there are 10 volumes before we get to that, and 20 afterwards.
      I was blessed with great timing. The other blessing that makes my drumming individual is that I was born left-handed. But my grandmother turned me into a right-handed person, so I'm ambidextrous. If I throw anything - play cricket or golf - it's done left-handed. But I write and cut with my left hand. I'm a weird handy guy.
      The music industry is still musicians playing music. If it has changed in any way, it is that nobody who really cares about music is running the industry. In the '80s, accountants ended up running it, and they still are. The record industry has fallen apart. But we are on to the new age, a digital one.
      When we came out we were this big crazy pop band with these weird haircuts - which weren't really that weird. But that is what they said. We got lucky.
      [at a celebration in his honor on January 20, 2014] It's a weird place to be this evening. All this praise is overwhelming really. It's great to look out and see all these people I recognize and three of them are meditating...I have to play something from the drums so you can see I can still hold the sticks.

=======================================================
Ringo  Starr was born on July seventh, 1940.  Named after his    father, he was the only child of Richard Starkey and Elsie Gleave. The two had met while working together at a local bakery. They eventually married in 1936.  The family resided at 9 Madryn Street, a  six-room terrace house in a poor and rough  working class section of Liverpool known as the Dingle.  Richard Sr. left home when little Richard, now called Ritchie, was three. In 1944 Ritchie and his mother moved to 10 Admiral Grove, a smaller, less expensive terrace house around the corner.  Ritchie called 10 Admiral Grove home until he moved to London with the Beatles. Determined to support herself and her child, Elsie went to work as a barmaid, often leaving Ritchie in the care of  neighbors or his paternal grandparents.  
At  the age of five, Ritchie started school at St. Silas Infants School, but his school career hit the first of many snags when, at age six, he developed    appendicitis.  His appendix ruptured resulting in  peritonitis and a ten week coma. Elsie was told on several occasions that her boy would not live, but eventually, to the doctor's surprise, he came round and slowly began to mend. After six months, recovery was within sight, but  then disaster struck. Ritchie fell out of the hospital bed necessitating an additional  six month hospital stay.  When he was finally released, Ritchie found that he was very behind in his school work.  He couldn't read or write, so a neighbor child, Marie Maguire, was recruited to help teach him. Ritchie never cared much for school, and the fact that he was so far behind didn't help. He would often play truant, a fact that no doubt influenced his dismal showing on the Review exam.  Since he didn't pass the Review,  he didn't even take the Eleven Plus exam and, as a result, wound up at Dinglevale Secondary Modern School at age eleven.
In  1953,  with Ritchie's enthusiastic blessing, Elsie married    Harry Graves. That same year Ritchie developed pleurisy. Complications resulted in another hospitalization, this one lasting two years. Despite all these hardships, Ritchie, by all accounts, remained  a contented easy-going individual if somewhat quiet and thoughtful. When he emerged from the hospital at fifteen,  he knew that returning to school was out of the question. He had  simply missed too much and felt that he could never catch up. After a recouperatory period at home it was time to start thinking about finding a job. 
Ritchie  took a messenger job with the British Railroad, but had to quit when he failed the medical exam.  He next worked as a barman on a boat that traveled between Liverpool and Wales, but he was fired when he turned up for work in an inebriated state and lipped off to his boss. Finally, when he was seventeen, he took a job at Henry Hunt and Son's engineering firm as an apprentice joiner.
It  was about this time that the skiffle craze hit. Ritchie and    Eddie Miles, another apprentice at H. Hunt and Son, started the Eddie Clayton skiffle group. With Ritchie handling the percussive duties, they and other similarly minded employees would entertain the workers at lunch time. After hours the strictly amateur group played at parties and local competitions. In December of 1957, Harry Graves  bought his stepson his first  real set of drums. It was  second-hand set  costing all of ten pounds which Harry hand carried from London to Liverpool by train. This rather ramshackle set was eventually replaced with a new black Premier kit for which Ritchie borrowed half the cost from his grandfather.  
Eventually  Ritchie joined the Darktown Skiffle group, but it was not uncommon for him to sit in with other bands. One of these was Al Caldwell's Texans with whom Ritchie first drummed  in March 1959.   In  November of 1959 Ritchie officially joined the band, now calling themselves Rory Storm And the Hurricanes and fronted by the charismatic Alan Caldwell.  
The  Hurricanes and their intrepid leader were known as much for their outlandish dress and exuberant stage performance as for their music and by 1960, they were the top ranked band in Liverpool. 1960  not only brought the band an offer of  a thirteen week summer engagement at Butlins in Pwllheli, Wales, but also a big dilemma for Richard Starkey. In order to accompany the band to Pwllheli, Ritchie would have to give up his apprenticeship at Hunt and Son. His parents desperately tried to persuade him to stay with the program as did his fiancee, a lass named Geraldine.  However, the lure of twenty pounds a week  proved to be too much.  The engagement was called off, the day job was abandoned, and Richard  Starkey traipsed off to a rather damp summer of adventure with Rory,  John  Byrnes, Charles O'Brien, and Wally Egmond. 
Ever  the showman, Rory who had already changed his name,    suggested that  Ritchie adopt a flashier stage monicker Because of his penchant for wearing rings on his fingers, Ritchie naturally evolved into "Rings" and then quickly morfed into the more Western sounding "Ringo." Starkey became shortened to Starr because it fit better with Ringo and so that his solo offering could be billed as "Starr Time."  His big numbers included "Boys", "You're Sixteen," "Big Noise From Winetka," and "Alley Oop."
By  the fall of 1960, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes were topping    the bill at the Kaiserkeller in Hamburg where Ringo made the acquaintance of  another Liverpool band, the Beatles. The Beatles had been hired to play at a much less prestigious club, the Ratskeller, but had been forced to change venues when locals had complained of the noise. The Beatles and The Hurricanes shared th grueling dusk till dawn schedule and despite the fact that the Hurricanes were paid considerably more money and had better accommodations, the two groups became friends. Ringo got on well with all the Beatles,  most notably George Harrison, and would often stay around during the Hurricane's off periods listening to the Beatles. During this stint in Hamburg Ringo joined Lou Walters, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison at Akustik Studios where the joint members of the Hurricanes/Beatles backed Lou Walter's renditions of  "Summertime." After Butlins, Hamburg, and a stint playing US air bases in France,  Rory and the band returned to Liverpool and the local rounds. On several occasions Ringo joined the Beatles substituting for their drummer Pete Best.
At  Ringo's twenty-first birthday party the small house at 10 Admiral Grove was filled to the bursting point with guests including members of many of    the leading groups of the time. However, by 1961 Ringo was growing somewhat disenchanted with Rory and the Hurricanes whose career had begun to stagnate.  After the second summer session at Butlins,  Ringo made up his mind to immigrate to Texas opting for a factory job in Houston, but the complicated immigration forms  put him off.   In 1962 Ringo returned to Hamburg to play drums for Tony Sheridan at the Top Ten Club, but  despite the good money, the private flat, and car which Tony offered him, the lures of Hamburg paled after a while and Ringo returned to the Hurricanes in time to join them for their third summer season at Butlins in Skegness.  In August, while playing in Skegness with the Hurricanes,  Ringo received two promising offers of employment, one form King Size Taylor and the Dominos and the other from The Beatles. Ringo eagerly threw in his lot  with the Beatles playing with them for the first time as their official drummer on August 18, 1962, a mere eighteen days before their  scheduled recording session for EMI at Abbey Road.
The  Beatles, who had recently been offered a recording contract with EMI, had  for a variety or reasons,  become dissatisfied with Pete Best.  When their producer, George Martin, expressed  doubts about Pete's drumming ability, they decided the time had come to let him go. Since they had worked with Ringo before and discovered that they all liked his drumming style and personality, he was the natural choice for Pete's replacement.  However, even though Ringo showed up for the first official gig with his hair combed into the appropriate Beatle style, it took a while for him to feel comfortable in the closely knit Beatle fraternity. Ringo felt himself something of the newcomer and outsider,  apparently not without reason.  He was not even told of John Lennon's wedding to Cynthia Powell on August twenty-third. Even more disheartening was the appearance of a session drummer at the September eleventh recording session.
On  that day, the Beatles made a second attempt to record    "Love Me Do."  Andy White took over the drum spot and Ringo was handed a tambourine.  That same day White also drummed on "PS I Love You" while Ringo shook maracas. It was, however, the September fourth Ringo version of "Love Me Do" that was finally released as the single and, according to George Martin, after the September eleventh date there was never any thought of replacing Ringo again. Eventually the feelings of newness wore off and Ringo settled in becoming pure Beatle. He fit in perfectly both as a drummer and as a personality. 
Ringo  served the Beatles well.    As a drummer he never tried to overshadow the music, working always with the song and the singer. On stage he seemed content to stay in the background feeding the others with his steady backbeat.  Despite his rather sad looking expression, Ringo was a happy and sensitive individual. In interviews and in their movies, his natural wit and wry humor emerged. He could be as funny as John, but without the biting sarcasm. People were drawn to him because of his friendly easy-going nature. He became known to the world as the lovable Beatle. He earned the other Beatles'affection and respect. After they split up, it seemed  for a long while that Ringo was the only one who stayed on good terms with the other three.
On  February 11, 1965, Ringo married his Liverpool sweetheart, Mary (Maureen) Cox. They had met back in the Cavern days when she had been a student hairdresser. Their love endured the manifestations of Beatlemania, his move to London, the seemingly endless rounds of tours, and the fact that their romance had to be kept secret from the fans. When Ringo had to have his tonsils removed in early December of 1964, Maureen came to London to nurse him. When she discovered that she was pregnant, the marriage was quickly arranged. Zak Starkey was born to his happy and proud parents on September 13, 1965. Ringo, having always longed for siblings himself, wanted to make sure that his baby boy experienced  such joys. Zak was followed by Jason Starkey on August 19, 1967 and sister Lee  Parkin Starkey on November 11, 1970.  To all who knew them, the couple seemed a perfect match. Their divorce in July of 1975 came as a shock to many. 
=======================================================
Ringo Starr, the man who was to become the legendary Beatles' drummer and the narrator for the world's most popular anthropomorphised train, was born Richard Starkey on 7th July 1940 in Liverpool, England.
He was born in the poorer Dingle area of Liverpool to dock worker Richard Starkey and bakery assistant Elsie. His mother and father separated when he was three years old and Starr's mother later re-married a man called Harry Graves, who was a close stepfather to Starr, who cheekily nicked-named the older man his ‘step ladder’.
In the summer of 1947, when Starr was six, he fell ill with an appendicitis, which landed him in hospital. Complications of the appendicitis led to an infection that put him in a coma, keeping him away from school for almost a year and putting him seriously behind in his schoolwork.
Starr was an accident and sickness-prone child. During his hospital stay for the appendicitis, to combat the boredom of a small child, he was given a couple of toys to keep his spirits up: a little red bus and a drum. Starr was very taken with the drum, but decided to give his bus to the boy in the bed next to him as a gift. Unfortunately as he leaned out of the bed to do so, he fell and hit his head, knocking himself out.
Being behind in his education, Starr could not read or write very well, so when he returned to school he was put in a class with children much younger than himself. At 13, he caught a cold that turned into pleurisy. It resulted in another trip to hospital and another slide away from literacy. Then, in 1952, he fell ill with tuberculosis.
"In those days, they used to put you in what we liked to call a greenhouse in the country, the countryside. And thank God, someone had invented Streptomycin. And you just sat around for a year getting well… So to keep you entertained, once a week, they'd have like lessons: could be knitting, could be modelling, occasionally, it was music. And they'd bring in tambourines, triangles and little drums."
From that moment, Starr wouldn't play in the band unless he had a drum. Drums became the love of his life. “They became the dream that one day I would have my own set, which happened. And then the other dream was that I would play with other musicians, which came true.”
Like the other three Beatles, Starr became interested with the Liverpool style of music known as skiffle. He started his own group called the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group in 1957. In 1959, he moved on to The Raving Texans. But before he was able to make money from his musical talents, Starr worked as a delivery boy for British Rail, behind a bar on a ferry and as a trainee joiner. He got the nickname Ringo around this time because of the numerous rings he wore on his pinky and ring fingers. The surname Starr arrived when he dropped the 'key' from Starkey.
His stepfather bought him a new drum kit and Starr promised to become an amazing musician. He travelled from band to band, but he eventually landed a spot with Rory Storm and The Hurricanes who were a popular band at the time. It was Storm who encouraged Starr to legally changing his name to Ringo Starr.
At this time, The Beatles were on the rise but they had already been through several drummers. At one point they were so desperate that they even invited strangers from the audience to fill the position. Ringo first met the boys in Hamburg in October 1960 while still with Rory Storm and The Hurricanes. The Beatles' drummer, Pete Best, was not considered by the other band members to be the greatest musician around, and they were keen to recruit Starr as his replacement. Consequently, the Beatles new A&R manager, George Martin, asked Starr to fill the position. He agreed, but when he played with The Beatles at The Cavern Club, a lot of long-time fans were still disappointed about Best's firing,
Starr became known as the friendly Beatle with a great sense of humour and quotable sayings. The song title ‘Eight Days A Week’ was written after one of Starr's expressions and the band's first movie was called 'A Hard Day's Night' (1964) after a phrase he coined one evening. His inventive drumming also gave the band a distinctive sound and his down-to-earth manner made him a levelling band mate.
Starr has been married twice, first to Maureen Cox on 11th February, 1965. The pair had three children, Zak, Jason, and Lee, but divorced in 1975. Zak followed in his father's footsteps as a drummer for groups like Oasis and The Who. Starr later wed Barbara Bach in 1981, to whom he remains happily married.
While John Lennon and Paul McCartney were widely praised for their song writing talents, Starr's contributions were not as readily acknowledged. He was known for his strong drumming talents but he also assisted in the group's creative process and provided some of its emotional stability and good humour. Unlike past drummers, who remained firmly in the background, Starr was seen an equal part of the Fab Four. His influence would later be seen on future generations of drummers.
The Beatles broke up for good in April, 1970 and by the end of the year, Starr has released two solo albums. By 1973 he had become the most commercially successful of the ex-Beatles at that time. He appeared in several feature films, and made TV commercials and voiceovers. He also continued to record and tour, under the banner of the All Starr Band. Some of Starr's hits were ‘Photograph’, ‘Back Off Boogaloo’, ‘You're Sixteen’, and ‘It Don't Come Easy’.
Post-Beatles, his acting talents were explored in such films as '200 Motels' (1971), 'That'll Be the Day' (1973), and 'Son of Dracula' (1974). He also starred in the comedy 'Caveman' (1981) with Bach, whom he married. On television, he starred in two children's series, most famously as the narrator for 'Thomas the Tank Engine' and later 'Shining Time Station'.
When George Harrison died in November 2001, Starr, McCartney and Eric Clapton appeared in concert to raise money for Harrison's legacy in exploration of alternative lifestyles, views and philosophies.
Starr's 2008 solo album, 'Liverpool 8', generated some of the strongest reviews of his studio work since the early 1970s. The album’s title song was a sweetly melancholy reflection on his early life in Liverpool, alluding to his pre-Beatles role as drummer for Rory Storm and the Hurricanes and the years that followed in the musical cyclone that was The Beatles. His two latest solo albums are 'Y Not' (2010) and Ringo 2012 (2012).
An original hippy, Starr's trademark motto is 'peace and love'. He had been asked in an interview what he wanted for his birthday and replied "just more peace and love," so on his 68th birthday, celebrated in 2008, he held a peace and love festival - with cup cakes.Starr was set to perform in his home town of Liverpool, and announced that he would be playing in the city in June 2011, although it was suggested that he may not be welcomed by all.The potentially chilly reception was due to comments he made back in 2008 when he appeared on Friday Night With Jonathan Ross and said that he missed "nothing" about the town he was born in.An unnamed source was quoted in the Daily Express as saying: "Obviously Ringo is going to be asked about it before he performs there and he’s keen to set the record straight. It was a joke that got taken out of context and Ringo is going to make it clear publicly that Liverpool remains very special to him."Starr's home town hit the headlines once again in March 2011, when it was announced that the birthplace of the former Beatle was in danger of being demolished.While Liverpool City Council were keen to stress that it was high time the houses in Madryn Street were demolished, Beatles fans vehemently disagree.Joe Anderson, Liverpool City Council, said in an interview with Clickliverpool.com that "the community in that area have been waiting for 11 years to have these houses demolished and believe they have waited long enough".Meanwhile, Philip Coppell, chairman of the Save Madryn Street campaign, argued that the house is a "priceless tourist resource" and one which "the city would be mad to destroy".

While some accused Ringo Starr of being a clumsy drummer, many more agreed with George Harrison's assessment: "Ringo's the best backbeat in the business." And while many in the wake of the Beatles' breakup predicted that Starr would be the one without a solo career, he proved them wrong. Not only has he released several LPs (the first came out before the Beatles disbanded) and hit singles, but he's also the only Beatle to establish a film-acting career for himself outside of the band's mid-'60s movies.
Young Richard Starkey's parents had divorced when he was three, and he was raised by his mother and stepfather, a Liverpool house painter his mother married eight years later. By the time he was 13, he'd been in and out of the hospital several times with pleurisy, and once, at age six, with appendicitis. After leaving the hospital in 1955, too old to return to school, he became a messenger boy for British Railways. In 1959, while working as an apprentice engineer, he got his first drum set as a Christmas present, and he joined the Ed Clayton Skiffle Group soon after. By 1961, he was playing drums in Rory Storme's Hurricanes. It was while on tour with that band in Hamburg, Germany, in 1961 that he met John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison. A year later, when drummer Pete Best was ousted from the Beatles, Starr agreed to join them. The Ringo stage name came from his penchant for wearing lots of rings.
Beginning with "Boys" on the Beatles' first British album, Starr was given the occasional lead vocal, usually on covers of country tunes such as Carl Perkins' "Honey Don't" and "Matchbox" and Buck Owens' "Act Naturally." Later he sang the lead on "Yellow Submarine" and "With a Little Help From My Friends," songs written for him by Lennon and McCartney. The Beatles (the so-called White Album) in 1968 featured Starr's first songwriting credit, "Don't Pass Me By." After appearing in three films with the Beatles, in 1967 Starr made his solo film debut playing a Mexican gardener in the film of Terry Southern's Candy. He appeared in The Magic Christian (1969, also from a Southern book); in 1970 he costarred with David Essex in That'll Be the Day; in 1973 he documented the success of glitter-rock star T. Rex by directing Born to Boogie; in 1975 he costarred again with Essex in Stardust; and in 1981 he starred in the moderately successful U.S. feature Caveman (in April of that year he married his Caveman costar Barbara Bach; it was his second marriage).
Starr's solo recording career began in 1970, just prior to the Beatles' breakup, with Sentimental Journey (#22, 1970) a collection of Tin Pan Alley standards (allegedly to please his mother) produced by George Martin, with a different arranger for each track. Beaucoups of Blues (#65, 1970), released later that year, was a country-music collaboration with guitarist Pete Drake and other Nashville sessionmen. It fared better than its predecessor, but failed to yield a hit. In 1971 Starr appeared on Lennon's Plastic Ono Band and Harrison's  All Things Must Pass LPs, and recorded two hit singles, the hard-rocking "It Don't Come Easy" (#4) and "Back Off Boogaloo" (#9). (Starr later acknowledged that Harrison had cowritten these two songs without being credited.) 
Starr appeared at Harrison's Concerts for Bangladesh and in 1972 sat in on Peter Frampton's Wind of Change LP. In 1973 he recorded Ringo (#2, 1973), with Richard Perry producing. The LP included three Top 10 singles —"Photograph" (#1), "You're Sixteen" (#1), and "Oh My My" (#5) —and featured songs and playing by the other Beatles; Lennon contributed "I'm the Greatest," McCartney "Six O'Clock," and "Only You" (#6). Blast From Your Past, a greatest-hits package, went to #30 in 1975. While comanaging a furniture-designing business with his brother in London, Starr in 1975 started his own label, Ring O' Records, and signed to Atlantic. Compared to his previous solo success, his albums for his new label made little impression; Ringo's Rotogravure, despite guest appearances by Lennon, McCartney, Eric Clapton, and Peter Frampton, stopped at #28 with one Top 30 single, "Dose of Rock 'n' Roll," and Ringo the 4th, at #162, was a flop. Bad Boy (#129, 1978) continued the downward spiral.
Starr remained a familiar presence, though. In 1976 he played at the Band's San Francisco farewell concert and appeared in the film of the event, The Last Waltz. In 1977 he contributed to an LP by British skiffle pioneer Lonnie Donegan. In late 1981 Starr had a Top 40 hit with "Wrack My Brain," from Stop and Smell the Roses (#98, 1981), a tune written and produced by George Harrison. None of his subsequent albums has come near the Top 100.
Old Wave was not released in the U.S. or the U.K., and during this time Starr suffered from myriad problems, foremost among them alcoholism and drug abuse, for which both he and his wife Barbara sought treatment at the Betty Ford Center in 1988. At one point earlier, Starr's drinking had gotten so bad that he went to court to block the release of material he recorded in 1987. In the meantime, Starr became a star of the kiddie set in his portrayal of the miniature conductor and narrator of the acclaimed PBS series Shining Time Station, between 1989 and 1991. (Starr had first narrated the British series Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends back in 1984.) 
Starr has since formed several celebrity configurations of his All-Starr band. The first, in 1989, featured Levon Helm, Joe Walsh, Clarence Clemons, Rick Danko, Billy Preston, and Dr. John. A 1992 lineup included Ringo's son Zak on drums, Walsh, Timothy B. Schmit, Dave Edmunds, Nils Lofgren, and Todd Rundgren. Later editions have included the Who's John Entwistle, Procol Harum's Gary Brooker, Jack Bruce, Peter Frampton, and Bachman-Turner Overdrive's Randy Bachman. The 1992 release of Time Takes Time, coinciding with the silver anniversary of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, brought a new flush of publicity for Starr, who often made it amply clear to interviewers that he did not wish to talk about the Beatles.
Though Starr has had little success as a recording artist in the '80s and '90s, he is never long out of view. He appeared in Paul McCartney's Give My Regards to Broad Street (1984), a television production of Alice in Wonderland (1985), with Zak on the Artists Against Apartheid album and video (1985), with ex-band mate Harrison in the video for "When We Was Fab" (1988) and as himself on The Simpsons (1990). In 1994 Starr's first wife, Maureen Cox Starkey Tigrett, died of cancer.
Starr returned to the studio in the late '90s. First he reunited with the other surviving Beatles to record two tracks for the Anthology 1 in 1995; he then released Vertical Man (#61, 1998), his most successful album in 20 years. Guests ranged from familiar faces like McCartney and Harrison to newcomers Alanis Morissette and Stone Temple Pilots' Scott Weiland, and the songs included a cover of the Beatles' "Love Me Do." The following year Starr recorded his first seasonal album, I Wanna Be Santa Claus. In 2001 he hit the road with a new All Starr Band that included Ian Hunter, Sheila E., Greg Lake, Howard Jones, and Roger Hodgson (Supertramp).
