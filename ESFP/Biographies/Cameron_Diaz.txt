 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Cameron Diaz was born in 1972 in San Diego. Her mother, Billie (Early), has English, Scots-Irish, and German ancestry, and her father, Emilio Diaz, was from a Cuban family (of Spanish origin). Self-described as "adventurous, independent and a tough kid," Cameron left home at 16 and for the next 5 years lived in such varied locales as Japan, Australia, Mexico, Morocco, and Paris. Returning to California at the age of 21, she was working as a model when her agency secured her an audition for the female lead in The Mask (1994) opposite rising comedian Jim Carrey. Despite having no previous acting experience, she got the role and was launched into stardom virtually overnight as the film became one of 1994's biggest hits. Preferring to feel her way effectively into the industry, she turned down subsequent high-profile roles and spent the next 3 years honing her acting skills in such character-driven independent films as The Last Supper (1995); Feeling Minnesota (1996); and Head Above Water (1996). She returned to main stream films in My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), where she held her own against Julia Roberts. By 1998, she'd earned full fledged star status for her performance in the box office smash There's Something About Mary (1998). With her name near the top on virtually every list of Hollywood's sexiest actresses, and firmly established as one of filmdom's hottest properties and most sought after actresses, Cameron Diaz appears to possess everything necessary to become one of the super stars of the new century.
      Was set to play Sonya Blade in Mortal Kombat (1995) but broke her wrist while taking karate lessons to prepare for the role and was replaced by Bridgette Wilson-Sampras.
      Cameron's father Emilio Diaz appeared in her movie There's Something About Mary (1998) as a "Jailbird.".
      She graduated from Long Beach Polytechnic (Poly) High School (Class of 1990) in Long Beach, California. As a member of that school's "Polyettes" dance-drill team, Cameron performed during half-time at football games.
      Police caught an airline security guard at Los Angeles International Airport stealing items from Diaz. Diaz reported her passport and a large sum of cash missing. [December 1999]
      Cameron's parents allowed the then-16-year old to spend five years traveling the world to pursue her modeling career beginning in Japan, where she was accompanied only by a 15-year-old fellow model.
      Was discovered by a photographer at a Hollywood party who, within a week, helped her land a contract with the Elite Modeling Agency.
      Her father was from a Cuban immigrant family (of Spanish origin). Her mother has English, Scots-Irish, and German ancestry.
      Became only the second actress to join the coveted $20 Million Club (after Julia Roberts), when she signed for that amount to do Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003) in January 2002.
      Photographer John Rutter was ordered to stand trial for attempted extortion, attempted grand theft, perjury, and forgery after trying to blackmail her with topless shots he had of her from a 1992 shoot. [November 2003]
      During her interview on Inside the Actors Studio (1994), said that she doesn't read scripts and wishes movies were filmed from start to finish because sometimes she doesn't understand them.
      Has been friends with Drew Barrymore since Charlie's Angels (2000). Both Drew and Cameron are huge fans of the rock group, Ratt.
      Ranked #1 in the "Worst Hollywood Signers 2006" list by "Autograph Collector" magazine (May 2006).
      After having her nose broken 4 times, she decided to undergo corrective surgery. [November 2006]
      Was set to play Jane in Fun with Dick and Jane (2005), but bowed out shortly before production due to scheduling conflicts.
      December 2007 - According to Forbes, for each dollar she got paid, Cameron Diaz's movies averaged $9 of gross income.
      As a child, her friends nicknamed her "Skeletor," because she was tall and had an infectious smile.
      She has hosted Saturday Night Live (1975) three times and appeared uncredited several times as the character "Kiki Deamore".
      Served as maid of honor at her best friend Drew Barrymore's wedding to Will Kopelman on June 2, 2012.
      Along with Tom Cruise, she attended the Knight and Day (2010) premiere at Roppongi Hills on Tuesday (September 28) in Tokyo, Japan. [September 2010]
      On July 6th, along with co-star Tom Cruise, she visited Rio de Janeiro, Brazil briefly - less then 24hrs - to promote their latest film, Knight and Day (2010). The following day, on July 7th, she attended another premiere for the film in Mexico City at the Cinemex Santa Fe. [July 2010]
      There were times when I'd go, "This outfit would look so badass with stilettos". You wanted those four-inch heels, those wrappy, strappy, show-off-your-pedicure shoes, but you couldn't do it. At the beginning of the scene it would have been fine because I'm just hanging out with the dude. But the next thing you know, you're kicking the dude's rear, so you had to make sure you had the right shoes on.
      I didn't realize it [The Mask (1994)] was a fairly large film that I was a part of. Halfway through I was going, "Is there any place that my mom and dad can see this film?" and they're going, "Cameron, at the theaters". I had no idea. Durrrrrrr. I'm blonde. I'm allowed.
      One thing I realized from Julia [Julia Roberts, her My Best Friend's Wedding (1997) co-star]--which I knew before, but was made very clear--is that when you're the star of the film, the crew looks to you to set the tone of everyday work. So when you come into work, whatever it is that you're giving off, that is what the tone is going to be for the working conditions.
      On Being John Malkovich (1999): "It's been said that in Hollywood there are only 14 different scripts. Well, this is number 15."
      Growing up, I was the plain one. I had no style. I was the tough kid with the comb in the back pocket and the feathered hair.
      I would kiss a frog even if there were no promise of a Prince Charming popping out of it. I love frogs. I'd lick him.
      We have a voice now and we're not using it. Women have so much to lose. I mean, we could lose the right to our bodies. If you think rape should be legal then don't vote. But if you think you have a right to your body and you have a right to say what happens to you and fight off that danger of losing that, then you should vote.
      My Latin roots are very strong. All my life, because I'm blonde and blue-eyed, people who aren't Hispanic can't believe I am. And people who are Hispanic always think I'm not, because I don't look like them. Being Latin is part of who I am and I bring that part to every role.
      "What we women need to do, instead of worrying about what we don't have, is just love what we do have."quoted Women's World (6-14-05)
      Toronto has such a nice balance as far as the films they show there. They kind of give an opportunity to everybody. You get the best of the best there. It's a good standard to be held up against, and it's very flattering to be in that festival.
      I'm like every other woman: a closet full of clothes, but nothing to wear: So I wear jeans.quoted in Woman's World 1-3-06.
      I go, 'God, you know, it all sounds so familiar. I know what you're saying, I really do. I just cannot respond to you back in Spanish. I can barely speak English properly.' I didn't grow up in a Cuban or Latin community. I grew up in Southern California on the beach, basically. And I'm third generation. I'm of Cuban descent, but I'm American. - when asked if she can speak Spanish.
      The last couple of years were hell. Like, I can't even tell you, it was so hard. I didn't know how to handle it. But I think I'm in a much better place now, because I stepped away for a second and took a breath. Hollywood is a funny place. It offers so much, but it can also take a lot away from you.
      I'm not 25 years old anymore, nor do I want to be. I wouldn't even want to go back to being 30. You know what I mean? That journey, I've done it already. I don't want to do it again. It's a lot of work to get through it, and I am excited about moving forward. I think that people get caught up in getting back to some place that they already passed or to a place where you cannot stay.
      Men are wonderful. I don't think my feeling about that is ever going to change. I'm never going to feel differently about men. I'm not a man-hater. It's just not in my nature. I think guys are amazing. I love the dichotomy, the differences in men and women. I think it's wonderful. It keeps things interesting. We can't walk in each other's shoes. We don't know what it's really like, but we certainly can make an effort to know each other a little bit better.
      My father's death will be a part of me forever, and I'm sure it's going to be a part of all of the roles that I play now. It's been a year since he died, and it's been an incredibly transformative year. It's just something that's going to be with me forever.
      What's changed from 10 years ago is that now I want a man who knows who he is. Someone who understands himself, has already dealt with his issues and who can say: "I see where I've been foolish before and I'm not going to be like that again."
      It will be cool to be under people's feet. It really is the place where people can understand exactly that actors are not really stars -- they don't exist in the sky, they exist on the ground just like everybody else. - on getting her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
      You know what terrifies me? Trailers to horror movies! I kind of want to look, but I'm always afraid that I'm going to look too long and see the one image that I'm not going to be able to get out of my head for at least a week every night before I'm going to bed.
      Women have always behaved badly. I think probably worse than men.Maybe men just don't have the stomach for it. They don't want to see it on film because they just can't take it. Any of my guy friends, when I tell them what women really talk about, they just don't want to hear it. But maybe it's time.
      [on playing "Elizabeth Halsey", the title role in Bad Teacher (2011)]: Obviously if I thought I could get somewhere with bigger boobies I would have done it by now. But for her, it's everything. It's called hard economic times. You can't find a millionaire like you could three or four years ago. It's an investment.
      The fountain of youth [for me], let's see...I guess it's exercise, healthy diet, lots of water, lots of laughter, lots of sex - yes, we all need that as human beings. Its healthy, it's natural, it's what we are here to do.
      Oh gosh, I can't even count how many times I've gotten on a plane for love. It's not unusual in this business; my lifestyle demands it. I'm always traveling for [whispers] cock. You've got to go where it is.
      I'm primal on an animalistic level, kind of like, "Boink me over the head , throw me over your shoulder. You man, me woman." Not everybody has the right kind of primal thing for me...I love physical contact. I have to be touching my lover, like, always. It's not optional.
      I'm not comfortable with the idea of cutting myself up. I hope I never become that vain. I will never get breast implants. I think in LA, a lot of girls are doing it to please other people. So, having big boobs may be in now, but in the future the fat-chested look will probably be back. I'm happy with the way I look.
      I think that all women have been sexually attracted to another woman at some point. It's natural to have connectivity and an appreciation for the beauty of other women.
      [on what she would do if she could be a man for a day] I would have sex. I would love to know how it operates! Like what the real mechanics feel like! It would be fun to feel the other side, wouldn't it?

Cameron Michelle Diaz (born August 30, 1972) is an American actress and former model. She rose to prominence during the 1990s with roles in the movies The Mask, My Best Friend's Wedding and There's Something About Mary. Other high-profile credits include the two Charlie's Angels films, voicing the character Princess Fiona in the Shrek series, Any Given Sunday, Knight and Day, The Holiday, The Green Hornet and Bad Teacher.
Diaz has received four Golden Globe Award nominations for her performances in the movies, Being John Malkovich, Vanilla Sky, Gangs of New York, and There's Something About Mary for which she also won the New York Film Critics Best Lead Actress Award. She is also a BAFTA Nominee. In 2013, Diaz was named the highest paid actress over 40 in Hollywood.[3]
Cameron Diaz was born in San Diego, California. Her mother, Billie Joann (née Early), is an import-export agent, and her father, Emilio Luis Diaz (1949–2008), worked for the California oil company UNOCAL for more than 20 years as a field gauger.[4][5] Diaz has an older sister, Chimene. Her father's family were Cuban (of Spanish descent), and settled in Tampa's Ybor City, later moving to California, where Emilio was born.[6][7] Her mother has English, German, and Cherokee ancestry.[8][9][10] Diaz was raised in Long Beach, California, and attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School.[11][12]
She began her career as a fashion model at age 16, and contracted with a modeling agency, Elite Model Management. For the next few years she worked around the world on contracts for companies such as Calvin Klein and Levi's.[13] When she was age 17 she was featured on the front cover of the July 1990 issue of Seventeen.[14] Diaz also modeled for 2-3 months in Australia and shot a commercial for Coca-Cola in Sydney in 1991.[15][16][17]
Diaz at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival with Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio for the movie Gangs of New York
At age 21, Diaz auditioned for The Mask,[18] based on the recommendation of an agent for Elite, who met the film's producers while they were searching for the main actress. Having no previous acting experience, she started acting lessons after being cast. The Mask became one of the top ten highest grossing films of 1994.[19] and launched Diaz as a sex symbol.[20][21]
Preferring to feel her way effectively into the industry, Diaz avoided large studio films for the next three years and took roles in the independent films The Last Supper (1995), Feeling Minnesota (1996), She's the One (1996), and Head Above Water (1996). She was scheduled to perform in the film Mortal Kombat, but had to resign after breaking her hand while training for the role.[22] Diaz returned to mainstream films with My Best Friend's Wedding and A Life Less Ordinary, both released in 1997. The following year, she played the title role in the smash hit There's Something About Mary (1998), for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for the category of Best Actress – Musical or Comedy.[13]
She received critical acclaim for her performance in Being John Malkovich (1999), which earned her Best Supporting Actress nominations at the Golden Globe, BAFTA, and SAG Awards. Between 1998 and 2000, Diaz was featured in many movies, such as Very Bad Things, Any Given Sunday, Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her, and the successful adaptation of Charlie's Angels.[13] In 2001, she won nominations for Best Supporting Actress for the Golden Globe Awards, the SAG Awards, the Critics' Choice Awards, and the American Film Institute Awards for Vanilla Sky, and also voiced Princess Fiona in the movie Shrek,[13] for which she earned $10 million. In 2003, Diaz received another Golden Globe nomination for Martin Scorsese's 2002 epic Gangs of New York, and became the third actress (after Wedding costar Julia Roberts) to earn $20 million for a role, receiving the sum for Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.
In 2005, Diaz played opposite Toni Collette and Shirley MacLaine in In Her Shoes (2005), a comedy-drama film based on the novel of the same name by Jennifer Weiner, which focuses on the relationship between two sisters and their grandmother. The film received generally positive reviews from critics,[23] and Diaz garnered acclaim for her performance of a dyslexic wild child engaged in a love-hate struggle with her plain, sensible sister (Collette), with USA Today calling it "her best work" then.[24] She followed In Her Shoes with a role in Nancy Meyers' romantic comedy The Holiday, also starring Kate Winslet, Jude Law and Jack Black. In it she played Amanda, an American movie trailer producer who temporarily exchanges homes with an British woman (Winslet). Released to a mixed reception by critics,[25] the film became on the biggest commercial successes of the year, grossing more than $205 million worldwide.[26]
Diaz's only film of 2007 was Shrek the Third, the third installment in the Shrek franchise. Although the film received mixed reviews from critics, in contrast to the critical acclaim achieved by the previous films,[27] it grossed $798 million worldwide.[28] The same year, Diaz also voiced Princess Fiona in a thirty minute Christmas special, directed by Gary Trousdale.[29] Diaz reportedly earned $50 million during the period of a year ending June 2008, for her roles in the Shrek sequel and her next film What Happens in Vegas opposite Ashton Kutcher.[30][31][32] A romantic comedy by Tom Vaughan, Diaz and Kutcher portrayed two strangers who awaken together to discover they've gotten married following a night in which they won a huge jackpot after playing the other's quarter. While audiences reacted positively to the movie, reviews for the film were negative.[33]
In 2009, she starred in My Sister's Keeper and The Box. Based on Jodi Picoult's novel of the same name,[34] My Sister's Keeper was released to mixed reviews in June 2009.[35] In the drama, Diaz plays a former lawyer and mother of two, one of who is dying of leukemia. A moderate commercial, it grossed $95 million worldwide, mostly from its domestic run.[36] Set in 1976, The Box, written and directed by Richard Kelly, stars Diaz and James Marsden as a couple who receive a box from a mysterious man who offers them one million dollars if they press the button sealed within the dome on top of a box, knowing that someone, somewhere, will die from it.[37] Critical response towards the psychological horror film was mixed,[38] and, though having grossed its budget back, is was considered a financial disappointment.[39]
In 2010, business magazine Forbes ranked Cameron Diaz as the richest Hispanic female celebrity, ranking number 60 among the wealthiest 100.[40][41] Also that year, Diaz reprised her voice role of Princess Fiona in Shrek Forever After, the fourth installment in the Shrek series. Although the film opened to mixed reviews from critics, it grossed a worldwide total of over $752 million and became the fifth top grossing films released that year.[42] Also in 2010, Diaz reunited with her Vanilla Sky co-star Tom Cruise in the action comedy film Knight and Day. In it, Diaz plays a classic car restorer who unwittingly gets caught up with the eccentric secret agent Roy Miller, played by Cruise, who is on the run from the Secret Service. Knight and Day received generally mixed reviews,[43] and while the comedy performed poorly at the box office in its debut, it became a sleeper hit at the box office at a worldwide gross of $262 million.[44]
In 2011, she played Lenore Case, a journalist, in the remake of the 1940s film The Green Hornet. Directed by Michel Gondry, Diaz starred alongside Seth Rogen, Jay Chou, and Christoph Waltz in the superhero action comedy film. Released to mixed to negative reviews form critics, who called it an "overblown, interminable and unfunny update",[45] the film ended its theatrical run on April 21, 2011, with a worldwide gross total of $228 million.[44] The same year, she played opposite Justin Timberlake and Jason Segel in Jake Kasdan's adult comedy Bad Teacher. In the film, Diaz plays an immoral, gold-digging Chicago-area middle school teacher at the fictional John Adams Middle School who curses at her students, drinks heavily, smokes marijuana. Again, it received mostly negative reviews from critics who felt that "in spite of a promising concept and a charmingly brazen performance from Diaz, Bad Teacher is never as funny as it should be."[46] A commercial hit however, the R-rated comedy grossed $216 million worldwide.[47] Also in 2011, Diaz was listed among CEOWORLD magazine's Top Accomplished Women Entertainers.[48]
In 2012, Diaz was cast in What to Expect When You're Expecting, directed by Kirk Jones and based on the pregnancy guide of the same name.[49] Diaz, who filmed her scenes in two weeks, portrays Jules Baxer, a contestant on a celebrity dance show and a host to a weight-loss fitness show, who becomes pregnant with her dance partner's baby.[50] Upon release, the ensemble comedy received mostly negative reviews and became moderate commercial success at a worldwide gross of $84.4 million.[51][52] Diaz's other film that year was Gambit, a remake of the 1966 film of the same name directed by Michael Hoffman and scripted by Joel and Ethan Coen. The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews,[53] and performed poorly at the box office, grossing only $10 million internationally.[54] Diaz also voiced Sigmund Freud in A Liar's Autobiography (2012), a 2012 British animated comedy film that is a completely inaccurate portrayal of the life of Monty Python alumnus Graham Chapman.
In Ridley Scott's The Counselor, Diaz's only film project of 2013, a thriller film about greed, death, the primal instincts of humans and their consequences, she starred along with Michael Fassbender, Javier Bardem, Penélope Cruz and Brad Pitt. Diaz plays a pathological liar and a sociopath, an immigrant who is now living the high-life after escaping a sordid past as an exotic dancer. While Diaz earned positive reviews for her performance, the film was largely panned by critics.[55]
Diaz's first film of 2014 was the romantic revenge comedy The Other Woman opposite Leslie Mann and Kate Upton. Primarily filmed in Downtown Manhattan, New York City, it depicts Diaz as a successful, strong-minded lawyer, who discovers her boyfriend is married — only to bond with his wife and another woman she discovers he has been cheating with.[56] While The Other Woman received mostly negative reviews from critics, who felt that it settled for cheap laughs,[57] it opened atop the US weekend box office with earnings of $24.7 million across the three days.[58] Diaz will next be seen in the comedy Sex Tape, with Jason Segel, and in a new film adaptation of the musical, Annie, playing Miss Hannigan.[59]
Diaz received substantial defamation damages from suing American Media Incorporated, after The National Enquirer had claimed she was cheating on Justin Timberlake.[60] She endorsed Al Gore publicly during 2000. Diaz wore a t-shirt that read "I won't vote for a son of a Bush!" while making publicity visits for Charlie's Angels.[61] Diaz has also been involved with the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), the first and largest nonprofit organization for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and has spoken as an advocate for military families.[62] Although she was quoted by a 1997 Time magazine article as saying she was germophobic,[63] Diaz specifically denied this on the June 26, 2009, edition of Real Time with Bill Maher, saying that a small comment she made twelve years earlier regarding public bathroom doorknobs was distorted out of proportion.[64]
Diaz has had long-term relationships with video producer Carlos de la Torre (1990-1995),[66][67] actor Matt Dillon (1995-1998),[68] actor/singer Jared Leto (1999-2003),[69][70] R&B singer/actor Justin Timberlake (2003-2006),[68][71] and New York Yankees baseball star Alex Rodriguez (July 2010–September 2011).[72] On why she still hasn't married, Diaz told Esquire magazine in October 2012, "It just wasn't the thing I was drawn to."[73]

Birth Name: Cameron Michelle DiazBirth Place: San Diego, CADate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 08/30/1972, VirgoProfession: Actor; model
Boasting stunning looks and an adorably goofy persona, Cameron Diaz began her career as a globe-trotting teen model before bursting onto the movie scene as a torch-singing sexpot opposite Jim Carrey in 1994's The Mask. The loopy comedy was Diaz's first acting job and it made her an instant star. Over the next few years, Diaz honed her acting chops in low-budget indie flicks (She's the One; Feeling Minnesota) and then was cast in the Julia Roberts blockbuster My Best Friend's Wedding, and she all but stole the film away from America's then-reigning movie sweetheart. In 1998, Diaz graduated to leading lady in the outrageous romantic comedy There's Something About Mary, which not only won her a legion of new fans but netted her a best actress award from the prestigious New York Film Critics Circle. Subsequently, Diaz took on a number of serious roles, including a homely (now that's acting!) wife in Being John Malkovich and a 19th-century pickpocket in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York, but she never fully abandoned her silly side. Charlie's Angels, released in 2000, was critically panned but put to good use her striking appearance and comic sensibilities, and further elevated her star status. Younger viewers fell for the California beauty---who has been romantically involved with such celebrity hunks as Matt Dillon and Justin Timberlake---in a different way when she voiced Princess Fiona in the beloved animated fairy tale Shrek and its sequels. In 2009, Diaz reunited with Tom Cruise for the romantic thriller Knight and Day, their first screen pairing since the 2001 mind-bender Vanilla Sky. It was slated for 2010 release.Cameron Diaz Fast Facts:

=======================================================
From luxury holidays with pop prince Justin Timberlake, to extravagant shopping sprees and high-end beauty treatments, this is the amazing world of Hollywood's highest paid actress.
Diaz grew up in Long Beach, California, and being taller and thinner than the other girls in her class she earned the nickname of ‘Skeletor’.
However, her striking looks soon led to offers of modelling work and, aged 18, she found herself working in Japan.
Whilst in Japan she met director Carlo de la Torre and the couple began a five-year relationship. During this time, Diaz enjoyed all the trappings of her modelling career, travelling all over the world working on campaigns for the likes of Calvin Klein and Levis.
Her movie break came alongside Jim Carrey in The Mask and subsequent projects The Last Supper, She’s The One and Head Above Water helped raise her profile. Her role in My Best Friend's Wedding with Julia Roberts was a wise move and the film was a huge worldwide box office hit.
Roles in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and A Life Less Ordinary followed, but it was with comedic roles that she scored her biggest hits. The quirky flick There's Something About Mary, with its infamous ‘hair gel’ scene, earned Diaz her first Golden Globe nomination in 1998.
Now gracing the arm of Matt Dillon, Diaz continued to make eclectic film choices and picked up her second Golden Globe nomination for Being John Malkovich in 1999. However, big time Hollywood success was now upon the young actress and roles in Shrek, Vanilla Sky and Charlie’s Angels helped turn the former model into one of America’s highest paid actresses.
Indeed, the second Charlie’s Angels film – Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, catapulted Cameron into the $20 million movie league.
Before appearing in the action comedy alongside Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu and Bernie Mac, which earned her an Imagen Foundation Award for Best Actress and Kids' Choice Awards for Favorite Actress, Diaz had wowed critics in Gangs of New York in the previous year. Her portrayal of Jenny Everdeane in the Martin Scorsese film had landed her four award nominations including a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress.
This was in addition to a host of accolades and nominations picked up earlier for Vanilla Sky, Charlie's Angels and Any Given Sunday, and she moved on to her next projects with the zeal to continue the good form. Indeed, 2005's In Her Shoes, The Holiday (2006), What Happens in Vegas (2008) and 2009's My Sister's Keeper all led to more critical nods and award nominations.
In 2010, Diaz joined co stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas for the fourth and final instalment in the Shrek film series in Shrek Forever After, which was released in 3D and achieved commercial success. A second partnership with Tom Cruise after their initial collaboration in Vanilla Sky followed in the action comedy Knight and Day, which only increased her star power.
Diaz appeared in 2011 superhero flick The Green Hornet alongside Seth Rogen and followed this up with Bad Teacher, a collaboration with old flame Justin Timberlake.
Her private life and high profile relationships with Matt Dillon, Jared Leto and Justin Timberlake have ensured Diaz has always attracted the attentions of the world's media.
In 2005, she successfully won a blackmail case against a photographer who threatened to release topless photographs of the star unless she bought them for millions of dollars. Diaz successfully proved the signature on the release form for the photographs was fake. She also accepted damages from a UK newspaper, which suggested she had a romantic involvement with a married man whilst in a relationship with Justin Timberlake.
