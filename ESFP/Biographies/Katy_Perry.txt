Katheryn Elizabeth "Katy" Hudson (born October 25, 1984), better known by her stage name Katy Perry, is an American singer, songwriter, and occasional actress. She grew up in Santa Barbara, California. She pursued a career in gospel music as a teen and released her debut studio album, Katy Hudson (2001), having had limited exposure to mainstream pop music in her childhood. The following year, she moved to Los Angeles to in an attempt to venture into pop and rock music. She recorded a collaborative album with The Matrix, which was released in 2009. A solo album she worked on with Glen Ballard was also recorded and never released.
In April 2007, Perry signed a recording contract with Capitol Records. She rose to fame with the release of her single "I Kissed a Girl" from her second album, One of the Boys (2008). Perry's third effort, Teenage Dream (2010), was preceded by the Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping singles "California Gurls" and "Teenage Dream", and later produced the number-one singles "Firework", "E.T.", and "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)". The album became the first by a female artist to produce five number-one Billboard hits, and the second album overall after Michael Jackson's Bad (1987). In March 2012, she re-released the album as Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, producing the number-one single "Part of Me". Her fourth effort, Prism (2013), spawned the number-one singles "Roar" and "Dark Horse".
Perry has received many awards and nominations, including eleven Grammy nominations. Billboard dubbed her as 2012's Woman of the Year. She has made the Forbes list of "Top-Earning Women In Music" for 2011, 2012, and 2013. Perry remains the only artist to spend 69 consecutive weeks in the top ten of the Hot 100. She has sold over 11 million albums and 81 million singles worldwide as of November 2013. She has six quintuple-platinum certified singles in the United States, more than any other artist.
Perry has ventured into celebrity endorsement and released fragrances Purr, Meow!, and Killer Queen. In late July 2011, she made her film debut voicing Smurfette in The Smurfs. In early July 2012, she released a 3D autobiographical documentary film, Katy Perry: Part of Me, which concentrated on her life as a touring artist and the dissolution of her one-year marriage to English actor and comedian Russell Brand.
Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson was born near Santa Barbara, California to Pentecostal pastors Mary Christine (née Perry) and Maurice Keith Hudson of Keith Hudson Ministries.[1] Her parents are both born again Christians, each having turned to God after a "wild youth". Keith formerly made and dealt LSD along with Timothy Leary while Mary dated musician Jimi Hendrix.[2] Through Mary, she is a half-niece of film director and producer Frank Joseph Perry, Jr.[3] She has an older sister named Angela and a younger brother called David; the latter is the lead singer of band Hudson.[4] Between the ages of 3–11, her parents moved about seven times to set up churches around the country, before settling again in Santa Barbara. Throughout their childood, they attended religious schools and camps, including Santa Barbara Christian School during their elementary years. Perry stated that she found it "tough" as a child to frequently switch between schools and lose friends, and that she sometimes felt "out of place" during the early part of her childhood.[5]
Perry's family lived in poverty and "barely got by" during her childhood and adolescence.[6] Her family sometimes ate from the food bank intended to feed the congregation at her parents' church, and used food stamps.[7] Perry described her parents as "uniquely strict", while Angela reminisced of their upbringing as "God's way or no way", resulting in bans of popular products. David recalled that they were not allowed to eat Lucky Charms as "luck is of Lucifer," and had to call deviled eggs "angel eggs."[5] Perry primarily listened to gospel music,[8] as listening to most "secular music" was prohibited in the family's home. She was prohibited from watching MTV while growing up, and discovered popular music while watching the music channel at her friends' houses.[9] Perry began singing while "copycatting" Angela, often practicing with her sister's cassette tapes. Perry performed the tracks in front of their parents, who suggested she take vocal lessons. She subsequently underwent training from the ages of 9–16.[10] Perry was incorporated into her parents' ministry and started singing at their church at age nine, before being given her first guitar for her 13th birthday.[2][11] She began writing gospel songs, which she frequently performed at religious functions. During her teenage years, Perry said she "tried to be like the typical California girl", trying out surfing and getting deeply involved in the local rollerskating scene. David described her as "kind of a tomboy" during that period.[5] Additionally, she took dancing lessons in a recreation building in Santa Barbara, which began with swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug.[12]
At age 15, Perry's singing attracted the attention of rock veterans from Nashville, Tennessee, who brought her there to polish her writing skills.[1] In December 1999, she completed her GED after her first semester of her freshman year at Dos Pueblos High School and left school in the pursuit of a career in music. Perry briefly studied Italian opera at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara.[13] In Nashville, she started recording demos and learned how to craft songs and play guitar.[8] After signing with Red Hill Records, Perry recorded her debut album, titled Katy Hudson. The album was released on March 6, 2001.[14] She embarked on The Strangely Normal Tour in support of the album.[15] The album was commercially unsuccessful, selling an estimated 200 copies. The label ceased operations in December 2001.[1]
She waned away from gospel music and began transversing into pop and rock.[5] Perry started writing songs with producer Glen Ballard,[3] and moved to Los Angeles, California. Shortly afterwards, she signed a record deal with The Island Def Jam Music Group.[16] In 2003, Perry briefly performed as Katheryn Perry to avoid confusion with actress Kate Hudson; later that year, she adopted the stage name Katy Perry. She was subsequently dropped from the Island Def Jam roster, and signed to Columbia Records in 2004.[1][5] That year, Perry provided backing vocals on Mick Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard",[17] which won the 2005 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.[18]
In October 2004, Blender magazine called Perry "The Next Big Thing". Columbia sought to make her the female vocalist of record production team The Matrix, who was working on an album. However, Columbia shelved the album after it was roughly 80 percent complete.[19] Subsequently, Columbia dropped Perry and shelved a solo album she and Ballard had been working on.[1] Of the songs, "Simple" was featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.[20] In the interim of being signed to another label, she worked in an independent A&R company called Taxi Music.[1] She provided background vocals on P.O.D.'s single "Goodbye for Now" and appeared in its music video in early 2006. In November, she played the love interest of her then-boyfriend Gym Class Heroes lead singer Travie McCoy in the band's music video for "Cupid's Chokehold".[21]
After being dropped by Columbia in 2006, the company's publicity executive Angelica Cob-Baehler enthusiastically recommended her to Virgin Records chairman Jason Flom. Flom was convinced that Perry could be a breakthrough star and set her up with the newly created Capitol Music Group, a merger between Virgin and Capitol, in April 2007.[1] The label arranged for her to meet with producer Dr. Luke, in order to add an "undeniable smash or two" to her existing material.[22] Perry and Dr. Luke co-wrote the songs "I Kissed a Girl" and "Hot n Cold" for her second album One of the Boys. A campaign was started with the November 2007 release of the video to "Ur So Gay", aimed at introducing her to the music market and establishing her image. A digital EP led by "Ur So Gay" was later released to create online buzz.[2][23] Madonna helped publicize the song by praising the track on the JohnJay & Rich show in April 2008.[24] "I Kissed a Girl" was released on April 28, 2008 as the lead single from One of the Boys. The first station to pick up the song was WRVW in Nashville, who after playing it for three days, were inundated with enthusiastic calls.[23] That same month, the track reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[25] One of the Boys was released on June 17, 2008, to mixed critical reviews.[26] The album reached number nine on the Billboard 200.[27]
On June 20, she began touring with the Warped Tour 2008.[28] In August 2008, Perry spoke out against rumors that her parents were opposed to her music and career, stating "They love and support me".[29] "Hot n Cold" was released as the album's second single on September 9. The song reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100, and topped charts in Germany, Canada, and Denmark. After Perry concluded her run on the Warped Tour, she began playing shows in Europe. "Thinking of You", was released on January 12, 2009 as the third single from One of the Boys, peaking at number 29 on Billboard. Perry launched her first headlining tour, the Hello Katy Tour, on January 23, consisting of 89 concerts throughout several countries. In 2010, Guinness Book of World Records recognized her as the "Best Start on the U.S. Digital Chart by a Female Artist," for digital single sales of over two million copies.[30]
The Matrix's self-titled debut album, which Perry had recorded with the band in 2004, was released during Perry's solo success. She wanted to hold the release until the fourth single of One of the Boys had been commissioned. Despite her wishes, The Matrix was released onto iTunes on January 27, 2009.[31] "Waking Up In Vegas" was released on April 7 as the fourth and final single from One of the Boys. The song became Perry's third non-consecutive top 10 single in the United States. During the summer of 2009, Perry filmed a cameo appearance for Get Him to the Greek. Her scene, in which she kisses her real-life future husband Russell Brand, was cut and does not appear in the film.[32] On August 4, 2009, she performed as opening act for one date of the band No Doubt's Summer Tour 2009.[33] The following month, she was featured on a remix of Colorado-based band 3OH!3's song "Starstrukk". The song was released on iTunes on September 8, 2009. In October, MTV Unplugged announced she had recorded a live album with acoustic performances of several One of the Boys tracks. It also included two new songs, "Brick by Brick" and a cover of Fountains of Wayne's "Hackensack". The live album was released on November 17.[34] On November 28, 2009, the Hello Katy Tour concluded, and the following month, she was featured on Timbaland's song "If We Ever Meet Again", from his album Shock Value II.[35]
On January 26, 2010, Perry starred as a guest judge on American Idol.[36] On May 7, she released "California Gurls" featuring rapper Snoop Dogg as the lead single from her third album, Teenage Dream. It reached the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 and remained at the top of the chart for six consecutive weeks.[37][38] She appeared as a guest judge alongside Simon Cowell, Cheryl Cole, and Louis Walsh during the Dublin audition stage of the seventh series of the English television show The X Factor on June 28, 2010.[39] She released the album's second U.S. chart-topping single, "Teenage Dream", on July 23. The album was released on August 24, 2010 and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.[40] Teenage Dream was met with generally mixed reviews from music critics, and has since sold 5.7 million copies globally.[41][42] She starred as a musical guest on NBC's Saturday Night Live on September 25, 2010 with Amy Poehler serving as host.[43] On October 18, "Firework" was released as the album's third consecutive number-one on the Hot 100.[44] The song has sold over 6.6 million digital copies in the U.S., and remains Perry's highest seller.[45]
In November 2010, Perry endorsed her first fragrance, Purr, which was released through Nordstrom department stores.[46] On February 16, 2011, a remixed version of "E.T." featuring rapper Kanye West was released as the fourth single from Teenage Dream. It topped the Hot 100 chart for five non-consecutive weeks, making it the ninth album in history to produce four number one singles on the Hot 100.[47] On February 20, 2011, Perry embarked on the California Dreams Tour in support of Teenage Dream. The tour spanned 124 shows in Europe, Oceania, Asia, North America, and South America, and grossed over $59 million.[48] On July 29, 2011, she made her film debut in the 3D family motion picture The Smurfs as Smurfette. The film earned $563,749,323 worldwide during its theatrical run,[49] though received mostly negative reviews from critics.[50] Perry became the first female artist to achieve five number one Hot 100 songs from one album when "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" topped the Billboard Hot 100 on August 17, 2011, and the second artist after Michael Jackson with his 1987 album Bad.[51][52] On September 7, Perry set a new record by becoming the first artist to spend 69 consecutive weeks in in the Top 10.[53] On September 23, 2011, she performed on the opening day of the 2011 Rock in Rio festival along with Elton John, Claudia Leitte, and Rihanna.[54]
On October 4, 2011, "The One That Got Away" was released as the sixth and final single from Teenage Dream. The song peaked at number three on the Hot 100 and became the album's seventh track to reach the top of the U.S. Hot Dance Club Songs chart.[55] Perry hosted Saturday Night Live on December 10, 2011 with Robyn serving as the episode's musical guest. The singer's work on the episode received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised her comedic timing and the episode's digital short featuring herself and Andy Samberg.[56] Her second fragrance, Meow!, was released shortly afterwards.[57] On December 14, 2011, Forbes ranked Perry #3 on their "Top-Earning Women In Music" 2011 with earnings of $44 million.[58]
On January 5, 2012, Perry was named the sixth best-selling digital artist in the United States, with sales of 37.6 million units according to Nielsen SoundScan.[59] That month, she became the first artist to have five songs sell over 5 million digital units.[60] Subsequently, Electronic Arts recruited her to promote their new expansion pack The Sims 3: Showtime.[61] On February 13, Perry released "Part of Me", the lead single from Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, which debuted at number one on the Hot 100 and became Perry's seventh single overall to top the chart.[62] In March, Billboard ranked Perry number fourteen on their 2011 list of top 40 earners, grossing nearly $12 million.[63] Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection was released on March 23, 2012. "Wide Awake" was released on May 22 as the second and final single from the album, peaking at number two on the Hot 100.[64] In June, Electronic Arts released a separate Sims 3 expansion pack featuring Perry-inspired furniture, outfits and hairstyles, titled The Sims 3: Katy Perry's Sweet Treats.[65] On July 5, 2012, Perry's autobiographical documentary movie Katy Perry: Part of Me was released to theaters through Paramount Pictures.[66] It garnered positive reviews and grossed $30 million worldwide at the box office.[67][68] Later that month, she became the spokesperson and ambassador for Popchips.[69] On November 30, 2012, Perry was named Billboard's Woman of the Year.[70] The following month, Forbes ranked her #5 on their "Top-Earning Women In Music" 2012 with $45 million.[71]
In the Fall of 2012, Perry told Billboard about Prism: "I know exactly the record I want to make next. I know the artwork, the coloring and the tone..... I even know what type of tour I'm doing next. I'll be very pleased if the vision I have in my head becomes a reality."[72] After taking time off from her professional career following the release of her autobiographical film, she worked on the album from November 2012 to July 2013. Perry reprised her role as Smurfette in The Smurfs 2, which was released in theaters on July 31, 2013.[73] The Smurfs 2 earned $347,545,360 in theaters,[74] though like its predecessor received generally negative reviews from critics.[75] Killer Queen was released as her third fragrance in August 2013 through Coty, Inc.[76] "Roar" was commissioned as the lead single from Prism on August 10, 2013.[77] Perry recorded and co-wrote a duet with her then-boyfriend John Mayer titled "Who You Love" for his album Paradise Valley. The song was released on August 12, 2013.[78] Although Perry told L'Uomo Vogue in June 2012 that she planned to have "darker elements" in Prism,[79] she revealed to MTV during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards that she changed the album's direction after periods of self-reflection. She commented "I felt very prismatic", which inspired the album's name.[80] She closed the Video Music Awards with her first live performance of "Roar" on August 25, 2013.[81] On September 4, 2013, "Roar" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[82] She made a musical guest appearance on Saturday Night Live with Bruce Willis as host on October 12, 2013.[83] "Unconditionally" was released as the second single from Prism four days later.[84]
Prism was released on October 18, 2013 and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart.[85] Four days later, Perry debuted new songs off the album at the iHeartRadio Theater in Los Angeles.[86] On December 11, 2013, Forbes ranked her #7 on their "Top-Earning Women In Music" 2013 with $39 million.[87] "Dark Horse" was released as the album's third single on December 17.[88] In early January 2014, Perry became a guest curator of Madonna's secretprojectrevolution.[89] On January 29, 2014, "Dark Horse" became her ninth number-one single.[90] In early February 2014, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry named Perry the 5th Top Global Recording Artist of 2013, making her the highest-ranking woman to chart on the list.[91] On April 21, 2014, "Birthday" debuted as the fourth single from Prism.[92][93] In early May 2014, a portrait of Perry by painter Mark Ryden was featured in his exhibition "The Gay 90s", and shown at the Kohn Gallery in Los Angeles, California. Along with several other artists, she also recorded a cover version of the song "Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two)" on a limited-edition concept album to accompany the exhibition.[94] That month, a portrait of Perry by artist Will Cotton was included in the United States National Portrait Gallery.[95] Perry began her third headlining tour, The Prismatic World Tour, on May 7, 2014. It began in Europe,[96] and is also scheduled to take place in North America[97][98] and Oceania.[99]
Alanis Morissette (left) and Freddie Mercury (right) both significantly influenced Perry and her music.
During the early stages of her career, Perry's aspired to be like Amy Grant. Her musical styling gravitated towards the gospel genre which she focused to primarily as an adolescent.[100] At age 15, she was introduced to Queen's "Killer Queen" and describes it as being the song that inspired her to pursue a career in music.[101] She cites the band's front man, Freddie Mercury, as her "biggest influence" and expressed how the "combination of his sarcastic approach to writing lyrics and his 'I don't give a fuck' attitude really inspired my music".[102] She paid homage to the band by naming her third fragrance Killer Queen. Perry describes The Beach Boys and their album Pet Sounds as having a considerable influence on her music: "one of my favorite records and it influenced pretty much all of my songwriting. All of the melody choices that I make are because of Pet Sounds."[103] The singer holds the Beatles' album The Beatles and Pet Sounds in high esteem and described them as "the only things I listened to for probably two years straight."[104]
Perry cites Alanis Morissette and her 1995 album Jagged Little Pill as a significant musical inspiration, opting to work with her frequent collaborator, Glen Ballard: "Jagged Little Pill was the most perfect female record ever made. There's a song for anyone on that record; I relate to all those songs. They're still so timeless." Additionally, Perry borrows influence from Flaming Red by Patty Griffin and 10 Cent Wings by Jonatha Brooke.[105] Perry lists Carole King, Bonnie Raitt, and Joni Mitchell as musical aspirations, and intends to become "more of a Joni Mitchell", releasing folk and acoustic music, in the second half of her career.[106] Perry's autobiographical documentary Katy Perry: Part of Me was largely influenced by Madonna: Truth or Dare. She admires Madonna's ability to reinvent herself, saying "I want to evolve like Madonna."[107]
Perry has often listed multiple artists as having inspired her on specific songs and albums. Her third album, Teenage Dream, was styled significantly after the music of ABBA and the Cardigans. She cites Robyn as an influence on her fourth record, Prism, and went on to work with Klas Åhlund on the album as a result of his work with the singer. Aesthetically, she names Gwen Stefani and Björk as influences — particularly admiring the latter's "willingness to always be taking chances".[105] "Firework" was inspired by a passage in the book On the Road by Jack Kerouac in which the author compares people who are full of life to fireworks that shoot across the sky and make people go "Awww!".[108] Her second concert tour, the California Dreams Tour, was reminiscent of Alice In Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz.[1] She also credits the 1996 movie The Craft for being the influence behind her song "Dark Horse",[109] and Eckhart Tolle's book The Power of Now for influencing Prism.[110]
"When I am in between records, sometimes I doubt myself. I'll be like: Did I just get lucky, or did I mass-manipulate the world into thinking that seven songs were worth a number-one position? And then I go back into the studio and I start writing, and the true essential oil of who I am comes bubbling back up and reminds me that it's always been inside of me, that nobody can take this away no matter what comment anyone makes. It's going to be there because it's what I was born with and it's what I've worked on my whole life."
While Perry's music frequently contains elements of pop, rock, electronic, dance, and disco, Katy Hudson falls within the gospel genre. Her subsequent release, One of the Boys, is predominantly pop rock and includes lyrical themes of heartbreak and teenage adventure. Teenage Dream notably features more electronic and disco influences and finds the singer touching on the subjects of teenage love, self-empowerment, and personal growth. Perry's fourth album, Prism, is significantly influenced by dance and pop music. Lyrically, the album addresses relationships, self-reflection, and living in the present. Many of her songs, particularly on Teenage Dream, reflect on life and love between teenage youths; W described them as "odes to adolescent lust wrapped up in irresistible hook-laden melodies".[112] Self-empowerment is a common theme in Perry's music.[113]
Perry identifies as a "singer-songwriter masquerading as a pop star"[114] and maintains that honest songwriting is very important to her. She told Marie Claire: "I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think you become more relatable when you're vulnerable."[115] Kristen Wiig commented that "as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record."[104] According to Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune "being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet."[116] Perry's ability to relate to her audience through her music has been noted; W labeled her "pound for pound..... the most potent pop star of the day—her hits are relatable with just a hint of experimentation"[112] Her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics has been criticized – with Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times noting frequent "clichés" within her lyrics.[117] Perry has co-written songs for other recording artists, including Ashley Tisdale ("Time's Up")[118] Selena Gomez & the Scene ("Rock God" and "That's More Like It"),[119][120] Jessie James ("Bullet" and "Girl Next Door"),[121] Kelly Clarkson ("Long Shot" and "I Do Not Hook Up"),[122] Lesley Roy ("Slow Goodbye"),[123] Britney Spears ("Passenger"),[124] and Iggy Azalea ("Black Widow").[125]
Perry possesses a contralto vocal range.[126][127] Her singing has received both praise and criticism; Betty Clarke of The Guardian commented that her "powerful voice is hard-edged"[128] while Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone described Perry's vocals as "processed staccato blips" on Teenage Dream.[129] Darren Harvey of musicOMH likened Perry's vocals on One of the Boys to Alanis Morissette's, both possessing a "perky voice shifting octaves mid-syllable".[130] Alex Miller from NME felt that on One of the Boys "Perry's problem is often her voice..... somewhere along the line someone convinced her she was like, well, a ballsy rock chick",[131] though Bernadette McNulty from The Daily Telegraph praised her "rock chick voice" in a review of a concert promoting Prism.[132]
Perry is considered a music industry sex symbol; GQ labelled her a "full-on male fantasy",[6] while Elle described her body "as though sketched by a teenage boy".[133] Vice dubbed her a "'serious' popstar/woman/sex symbol" in May 2014.[134] She was placed at number one on the Maxim Hot 100 in 2010, with readers voting her the "hottest woman on Earth".[135] Men's Health readers voted her the "sexiest woman of 2013".[136] In early November 2010, Perry told Harper's Bazaar of her figure: "I don't have a Kate Moss body, but I'm very proud and happy with mine."[137]
Noted for her unconventional style of dress,[12] Perry's choice of fashion often incorporates humor, brightly colors, and food-related themes[138] such as her trademark spinning peppermint swirl dress.[139] Vogue described her as "never exactly one to shy away from the outrageous or the extreme in any realm",[140] while Glamour named her the "queen of quirk".[141] In early February 2009, she described her fashion style as "a bit of a concoction of different things" and stated "I love a good sense of humor in clothes".[12] Perry told Harper's Bazaar: "I have multipersonality disorder—in a very good way, of course—when it comes to my fashion choices."[137] Perry lists Gwen Stefani, Shirley Manson, Chloë Sevigny, Daphne Guinness, Natalie Portman, and the fictional character Lolita as her style icons.[112][142]
On social media, Perry surpassed Justin Bieber as the most followed person on Twitter in early November 2013.[143] In late January 2014, she became the first person to gain 50 million followers on the site.[144] Forbes commended Perry on her social media usage, saying "Perry makes excellent use of Twitter, talking to her fans and sharing funny photos and videos in a way that makes them all feel like Perry is their best buddy."[145] Keith Caulfield of Billboard stated that she is "the rare celebrity who seems to have enormous popularity but genuine ground-level interaction with her adoring KatyCats."[146]
During the 2008 Warped Tour, Perry had a cast made of her breasts to raise money for the Keep A Breast Foundation.[147] She later designed an item of clothing for H&M's "Fashion Against AIDS" campaign, which raises money for HIV/AIDS awareness projects.[148] In late September 2010, she helped build and design the Boys Hope/Girls Hope foundation in Baltimore for youth shelter along with Raven-Symoné, Shaquille O'Neal, and the cast of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.[149] She dedicated the music video to her song "Firework" to the It Gets Better Project,[150] and donated the proceeds from her single "Part of Me" to the charity MusiCares, which helps musicians in times of need.[151] During her California Dreams Tour, Perry raised over $175,000 for the Tickets-For-Charity fundraiser. The money was divided between three charities: the Children's Health Fund (CHF), Generosity Water, and Humane Society of the United States.[152] On her 27th birthday, Perry set up a donations page for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Auckland.[153] She performed her song "Firework" with an autistic fan named Jodi DiPiazza at Comedy Central's Night of Too Many Stars on October 13, 2012.[154] In early December 2012, Perry was awarded the Trevor Hero Award by The Trevor Project for her work and activism for LGBT youth.[155]
In April 2013, Perry joined UNICEF to assist children in Madagascar with education and nutrition,[156] and appeared in a video clip for the "Chime For Change" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment.[157] She hosted and performed at the We Can Survive concert along with Bonnie McKee, Kacey Musgraves, Sara Bareilles, Ellie Goulding, and duo Tegan and Sara at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, California on October 23, 2013. The concert's profits went towards Young Survival Coalition, an organization aiding breast cancer in young women.[158] On December 3, 2013, Perry was officially named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, "with a special focus on engaging young people in the agency's work to improve the lives of the world's most vulnerable children and adolescents."[159] On March 29, 2014, she helped raise $2.4 million for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles along with other celebrities such as Ryan Seacrest, Pharrell Williams, Tim Allen, Lisa Edelstein, and Riley Keough.[160] In early May 2014, Perry and a selection of other artists recorded a cover version of the song "Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two)" for a concept album to accompany painter Mark Ryden's art exhibition, titled "The Gay 90s". All profits from sales of the album were donated to the charity Little Kids Rock, which supports musical education in underprivileged elementary schools.[94] A portion of the money generated from tickets to her Prismatic World Tour will go to UNICEF.[97]
While working on her collaborative record with Glen Ballard, Perry became romantically involved with her co-writer and Relient K lead singer, Matt Thiessen.[161] She was linked to late actor Johnny Lewis throughout 2005–2006. He died in September 2012.[162] Perry was involved in a personal relationship with rapper Travie McCoy from November 2006 to late December 2008.[163] Shortly before their relationship ended, New York Daily News reported that Perry had become engaged to McCoy. She rebuffed the rumor and responded "NOT engaged! But thanks for the free press New York Daily News! You should fact check with the source before you spread worldwide news like that."[164]
Perry first met Russell Brand during the summer of 2009 when she filmed a cameo appearance for his film Get Him to the Greek, which ultimately did not make the final cut.[32] The two began dating after meeting again at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[165] The couple were engaged on New Year's Eve 2009 while vacationing in Rajasthan, India.[166] They married on October 23, 2010, in a traditional Hindu ceremony near the Ranthambhore tiger sanctuary in Rajasthan.[167] After fourteen months of marriage, Brand filed for divorce on December 30, 2011, citing irreconcilable differences. The marriage was legally dissolved July 16, 2012.[168] Katy Perry: Part of Me revealed that their conflicting career schedules and him wanting children before she was ready led to the end of the marriage.[1] In June 2013, she revealed to Vogue that Brand did not like the idea of her "being the boss" and never spoke to her again after sending a text message that he was divorcing her.[111] She also told Billboard in late September 2013 that she was initially so distraught over the divorce that she contemplated suicide.[110]
Perry began an on-again, off-again relationship with singer John Mayer in August 2012.[169] She denied engagement rumors during a January 2014 interview with GQ, stating "There's no rush."[6] Their relationship ended in late February 2014.[170] Perry said in an interview with Chelsea Handler in June 2014 that she still has "a lot of respect" for Mayer and that there is no "bad blood" between the pair.[171]
Perry is an LGBT rights activist. She supported Stonewall during their "It gets better..... today" campaign to prevent homophobic bullying.[172] Perry told Do Something in November 2008 "I am a gay activist and I say that proudly..... I've always been a very open-minded person, but I definitely believe in equality." She confirmed that she voted against Proposition 8, an amendment that would legally define marriage as a union solely between a man and a woman in California.[173] In June 2012, Perry expressed her hopes for LGBT equality, commenting "hopefully, we will look back at this moment and think like we do now concerning [other] civil rights issues. We'll just shake our heads in disbelief, saying, 'Thank God we've evolved.' That would be my prayer for the future."[174] She has cited her support for universal health care, saying "the fact that America doesn't have free health care drives me fucking absolutely crazy, and is so wrong."[175]
Through Twitter and by performing at his rallies, Perry supported President Barack Obama in his November 2012 run for re-election, due to his stance on same-sex marriage[176] and believing in "equal rights for all".[177] She performed at three rallies for Obama, in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Wisconsin, singing a rendition of "Let's Stay Together" as well as a selection of her own songs. During one of the performances, she wore a dress made to replicate a voting ballot, with Obama's box filled in.[178] On Twitter, she encouraged her followers to vote for Obama.[179] After Obama was re-elected, Perry sent him a congratulatory tweet, saying "The people have the power! Proud to stand by you for 4 more years."[180] In August 2013, Perry urged the general public not to vote for Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott due to his opposition towards gay marriage.[181] In April 2014, she publicly supported Marianne Williamson in her campaign for California's 33rd congressional district by attending a political press event.[182]
Perry has received many awards and nominations for her work as a recording artist. She has earned eleven Grammy nominations,[183] two American Music Awards,[184][185] four MTV Video Music Awards,[186][187] fourteen People's Choice Awards,[188] and two Guinness World Records.[30][52] In late September 2012, Billboard dubbed her the "Woman of the Year".[70] From May 2010 to September 2011, she spent a record-breaking total of 69 consecutive weeks in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100.[53][189] Teenage Dream became the first album by a female artist to produce five number-one Billboard hits, and the second album after Michael Jackson's Bad (1987).[51] She was declared the Top Global Female Recording Artist of 2013 by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).[91] As of June 2014, she has accumulated a total of nine number-one singles on the Hot 100, her most recent being "Dark Horse".[90] According to Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Perry is the third best selling digital singles artist in the United States, with 39.5 million digital singles sold. She trails behind only Rihanna and Taylor Swift.[190] As of May 2014, she holds the record for most quintuple-platinum certified singles in the United States. Her songs "Firework", "E.T.", "California Gurls", "Hot n Cold", "Roar", and "Dark Horse" have each sold over 5 million digital copies.[45] As of November 2013, Perry has sold more than 11 million albums and 81 million singles worldwide.[191][192]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Katy Perry was born in California, the middle child of pastor parents. She has an older sister and younger brother. Raised in a deeply religious family, Perry's first experience of performing was singing in church. A passion for music grew and at the age of 15, Perry began visiting Nashville, gaining experience of song writing and recording demos.She signed to a Christian record label, Red Hill, and recorded an album, under her birth name of Katy Hudson. The album was not a success. At age 17 she moved to Los Angeles and collaborated with producer Glen Ballard, but was not able to secure a lasting record deal. Perry did sign to Columbia Records in 2004, but again this did not prove a success, and she was dropped.An executive at Columbia recommended Perry to the chairman of Virgin Records, Jason Flom, which resulted in her signing for Capitol Music Group. She recorded her second album, "One of the Boys" and in the Spring of 2008 released the lead single, the controversial "I Kissed a Girl". The song proved a smash, hitting the number one slot in several countries. Other hit singles followed and the album was a commercial success.Perry was now established as a pop superstar and cemented her position with the release of her next album "Teenage Dreams", which spawned more huge hits including "California Gurls" and "Firework". Many awards and music industry records followed. In 2012 Perry made the move into movies, releasing the documentary feature film Katy Perry: Part of Me (2012).
      Parents Keith Hudson and wife Mary Hudson (neé Perry) are both pastors. She's their middle child and has one older sister (Angela Hudson) and one younger brother (David Daniel Hudson).
      Got engaged to Russell Brand during the Christmas holidays in 2009. They were dating since September 2009.
      Her husband, Russell Brand, filed for divorce from her after a year of their marriage [December 30, 2011].
      When her single "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" from her hit album "Teenage Dream" went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 2011, the album became only the second album after Michael Jackson's "Bad" to generate five #1 singles. Perry became the first female artist to achieve this feat.
      Was reportedly offered $20,000,000 to join American Idol: The Search for a Superstar (2002)'s 12th season in 2013 as a judge, but declined.
      Katy's ancestry is three sixteenths Portuguese (Katy's mother is of three eighths Portuguese descent). Katy's other roots include English, German, and Irish.
      Katy once described herself as "a fatter version of Amy Winehouse and a skinnier version of Lily Allen". Later, Allen took offense to the statement and threatened to release Perry's personal phone number.
      In 2009 while working on a magazine shoot, Katy had a chimp on set, which urinated all over her and forced her to take a shower in the middle of the shoot.
      She Attended Dos Pueblos High School in Santa Barbara, California before she dropped out of her freshman year to pursue her music career.
      She holds two Guinness Book World Record: 'Best Start on the US Digital Chart by a Female Artist' in 2010 and 'Best First Female with Five Number One US singles from One Album' in 2013.
      Has been in a relationship with singer John Mayer since mid 2012, the two released a duet together called "Who You Love" in 2013.
      [on who she wants to kiss] Scarlett Johansson before she gets married to Ryan Reynolds. She is a classic beauty. I love that 1940s pin-up look.
      Have I ever kissed a girl? Of course I have. I can't sing a song and not have done it. That'd be complete hypocrisy. I fancy Scarlett Johansson, Natalie Portman and Angelina Jolie - I'd definitely kiss them.
      [on Rihanna] We're friends and we're both kind of on this crazy roller coaster, and ... it's nice to have good girlfriends. I pride myself on having cool chicks in my life, and she's a cool chick.
      [on future husband Russell Brand] He's a genius and geniuses are both wonderful and delicate in the greatest way.
      [on Rihanna missing her wedding] I was upset she couldn't make it but let me promise you, there was no one more upset about it than her. When you have an album coming out you don't have a spare second in the day and you're answerable to the record company. She felt really bad she couldn't be there but we're still the very best of friends. My girl organized the best bachelorette party ever and I'll always love her to bits.
      Look, any couple in a serious relationship has that talk about babies, but we haven't decided when. Russell wants lots of children and I think there's something amazing about tons of kids running around. We probably won't have the talk again for a few years - it's important to enjoy each other before having babies.
      My singing is really important to me, but when children come along they'll be my main focus. I'd never put my career in front of my babies - it'd be a case of fitting jobs around them.
      (on her song "I Kissed a Girl") The song was inspired by a friendship I had with a girl when I was 15, and I did kiss her. I was totally obsessed with her. She was beautiful - porcelain skin, perfect lips - and I still talk to her, but I've never told her the song is about her.
      "I Kissed a Girl" was inspired when I opened up a magazine and I saw a picture of Scarlett Johansson. I was with my boyfriend at the time, and I said to him, 'I'm not going to lie: If Scarlett Johansson walked into the room and wanted to make out with me, I would make out with her. I hope you're okay with that?'
      This is a really important time in my life. I can't just be the girl who sang I Kissed a Girl. I have to leave a legacy.
      [on her documentary Katy Perry: Part of Me (2012)] I wanted to show the entire operation. People just think I'm the girl wearing the ruby slippers. I wanted to show them at the end of the journey. I am the Oz as well.
      The number one issue for me is equal rights, whether it's being able to be equal in love, and being treated equally whether you have ovaries or not. (Billboard, 2012)
      I remember hearing Killer Queen by Queen and falling down in what felt like slow motion in my bed listening to the lyrics. And I thought to myself, 'Oh my gosh, this music is incredible. These lyrics speak to me...' and that made me want to be what I am.
Queen's track 'Killer Queen' made me discover music and helped me come into my own at the age of 15. The way Freddie Mercury delivered his lyrics just made me feel like a confident woman; I'd say his fingerprint is all over me in general.
      I get drunk, I pick my nose, I swear and I fart! I don't care, I'm not planning to become the President of the United States.
      When I was 15, I fell in love with a female friend. I thought she was beautiful and wanted to be like her. She had such a huge impact on my life, but I never told her how I felt.
      I've told my boyfriend that if Scarlett Johansson wanted to go out with me, I'd ditch him immediately. Female beauty can be incredibly powerful... Actually, I'm obsessed with beautiful women and their elegance. I like the paradox of appearing innocent and sexy all at once.
      There's times when you see other people who, the only reason why they have success is because they're just shock jocks, which works for a period of time. I haven't really taken off all my clothes yet... Yeah, I've done my fair share of 'naked on a cotton candy cloud' situation, but everything is with a wink. It's not like, 'Here's my vagina'.
      I don't believe in a heaven or a hell or an old man sitting on a throne. I believe in a higher power bigger than me because that keeps me accountable. Accountability is rare to find, especially with people like myself, because nobody wants to tell you something you don't want to hear. I'm not Buddhist, I'm not Hindu, I'm not Christian, but I still feel like I have a deep connection with God. I pray all the time - for self-control, for humility. There's a lot of gratitude in it. Just saying 'thank you' sometimes is better than asking for things.
      People don't understand that I have a great relationship with my parents - like, how that can exist. There isn't any judgment. They don't necessarily agree with everything I do, but I don't necessarily agree with everything they do. They're at peace with - they pray for me is what they do. They're fascinated with the idea that they created someone who has this much attention on her.

1990sGospel GirlBorn Katheryn Hudson, Perry grows up the middle child of two devout Christian ministers from Santa Barbara. "I was raised in a very pseudo-strict religious household where the only thing on the menu was [gospel standards like] 'Oh Happy Day,' 'His Eye Is on the Sparrow' and 'Amazing Grace'," Perry later tells MTV. The sheltered teen begins taking singing lessons and traveling to Nashville, where her parents have contacts in the gospel recording industry.  2001The Other Kate HudsonAt 16, Perry releases a Christian pop album as Katy Hudson. "It reached literally maybe 100 people," the singer tells EW, "and then the label went bankrupt."

The singer, who writes or cowrites every track on the album, makes waves with her '40s pin-up looks, risqué themes and tongue-in-cheek lyrics. "They're not meant to be 'Oh, no!' songs! They are my life, and I guess my life is a little bit 'Oh, no,'" she tells EW. "I Kissed a Girl," a flirty, pop-rock fusion, spends weeks atop the charts in more than 20 countries.  Dating a HeroPerry begins dating Gym Class Heroes frontman Travis McCoy. "She's super hot," he tells PEOPLE of falling for his Warped tour tourmate. After a year of dating and even exchanging promise rings, they call it quits. "It hurts right now," Perry says during a concert after the split. "When you breakup with someone you move on. You don't really want to move on...but you have to because they don't give you any choice." The newly single star is eventually linked to musicians Benji Madden and Josh Groban.2009JanuaryHello KatyAfter earning a Grammy nomination for best female pop vocal performance for "I Kissed a Girl", Perry launches her first headline tour, Hello Katy, complete with a huge inflatable cat head and 3-D fruit. "You're gonna see me with all kinds of different things," she tells the AP. In February, she also takes the Grammy stage to perform "I Kissed a Girl" amid giant colorful fruit, gyrating female dancers and user-submitted fan videos.

On the strength of its lead single "California Gurls," the singer's sophomore effort tops the Billboard 200 albums chart and earns her four Grammy nominations, including the coveted album of the year award. "It's really validating," she tells the AP of her album, which also earns a 2011 Grammy nomination for record of the year for her inspirational hit "Firework".  October 23Becoming Mrs. BrandPerry and Brand tie the knot in a "very private and spiritual ceremony" held at a resort in India, the newlyweds announce in a statement.

"We'll get married in front of our friends and family…and keep it sort of normal." The lavish affair, which lasted several days, treated guests to safaris, song and dance numbers and several parties.2011December 30Heading Towards DivorceA mere 16 months after exchanging vows in India, Brand files for divorce from Perry.

        A former Christian artist, Katy Perry rebranded herself as a larger-than-life pop star and rose to prominence during the summer of 2008. Before she topped the charts with songs like "I Kissed a Girl" and "California Gurls," though, she spent the better part of a decade recording music under a different name. Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson (or Katy Hudson, as she billed herself on her 2001 gospel album) was born on October 25, 1984, in Santa Barbara, California. Raised in a religious household as the daughter of two pastors, she was forbidden to listen to secular bands as a child, although a childhood slumber party introduced her to the music of Alanis Morissette and Freddie Mercury. Religious music remained at the forefront, however, and Katy released a self-titled Christian album in 2001 under her original name. She would later abandon the genre (and her given surname) in favor of a pop career. At age 17, she began working with hitmaker Glen Ballard, who had produced and co-written for Alanis Morissette. Several years later, she teamed up with the Matrix, a Grammy-nominated production/songwriting team whose résumé included collaborations with Avril Lavigne, Shakira, and Korn. Tired of producing music for other artists, the Matrix had plans to record an album of their own, with Perry serving as one of the group's two singers. The project was ultimately shelved, but not before Perry appeared in a 2004 write-up by Blender magazine, who hailed her as "the Next Big Thing!" With the Matrix's unreleased album sitting in the vaults at Sony Records, Perry went back to the drawing board and began working on a solo album for Columbia. The project was eventually canceled, although two of its songs were later given to Kelly Clarkson, who scored a Top 40 hit with "I Do Not Hook Up" several years later. Perry (who, by this point, had shed her original surname due to its similarity to actress Kate Hudson) then signed with Capitol, who encouraged their new client to write her own music and helped establish her image as a boisterous, tongue-in-cheek pop star. Perry's debut single, "Ur So Gay," generated a small buzz with its mischievous lyrics and clever music video, but it was "I Kissed a Girl" that proved to be her breakthrough hit, topping the charts in 20 countries and pushing its accompanying album, 2008's One of the Boys, into the Top Ten in America. Perry supported her debut by joining the Warped Tour that summer, where she toured alongside her boyfriend at the time, Travis McCoy of Gym Class Heroes. Meanwhile, "Hot N Cold" became her second multi-platinum hit, "Thinking of You" (one of the album's three songs written solely by Perry) cracked the Top 40, and "Waking Up in Vegas" cracked the Top Ten. Such success meant that Katy Perry had officially become one of the industry's biggest pop stars, celebrated as much for her outsized behavior and outrageous fashion choices as the music itself. She continued touring through the summer of 2009 (albeit without McCoy, whose boyfriend status had been revoked earlier that year) and found time to tape an installment of MTV Unplugged, which was released in November. Meanwhile, she worked on a new album and started up a whirlwind romance with comedian Russell Brand, eventually becoming his wife, a short-lived marriage that would last for only a year. She would later begin an on-again, off-again relationship with adult-alternative singer/songwriter John Mayer. Recording sessions for her album wrapped up in early 2010, and Perry scored her second number one single with "California Gurls," which was released that May. The accompanying album, Teenage Dream, followed in August. The album was reissued in 2012 as Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, with the bonus track "Wide Awake," earning Perry a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Solo Performance. In 2013, Perry announced the release of Prism, her fourth album, with the number one single "Roar." Written and produced in collaboration with a host of artists and producers (including Sia, Diplo, Max Martin, Bloodshy, and Emeli Sandé), it was inspired musically by Robyn, Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, and Prince, and lyrically by her past relationships. Appearing in October, it hit number one in the U.S. and U.K., followed by another Billboard chart-topper, "Dark Horse," featuring Juicy J. ~ Andrew Leahey, Rovi

Hometown: Santa Barbara, California, United States In a Relationship With:John Mayer Best Quotes:“I got this Jesus tattoo on my wrist when I was 18, because I know that it's always going to be a part of me. When I'm playing, it's staring right back at me, saying, 'Remember where you came from.'”“I unfortunately still crave chicken McNuggets and bacon, which is the meat candy of the world.”“I'm kind of a good girl - and I'm not. I'm a good girl, because I really believe in love, integrity, and respect. I'm a bad girl, because I like to tease. I know that I have sex appeal in my deck of cards. But I like to get people thinking. That's what the stories in my music do.” 
Katy Perry (born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson in Santa Barbara, CA on October 25, 1984) is a singer, songwriter, and actress. At an early age, she began performing and singing Christian music, following in her parents’ footsteps. Later, Katy began to focus on mainstream music, and first gained recognition with her debut album, One of the Boys, in 2008. Three of the songs were hit Billboard Hot 100 top-ten songs: “I Kissed A Girl,” “Hot n Cold,” and “Waking Up in Vegas.” Perry’s third album produced five number number one singles: “California Gurls,” “Teenage Dream,” “Firework,” “E.T.,” and “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.).” Her California Dreams Tour earned nearly $60 million worldwide, and she has been nominated for nine Grammy Awards. She has sold 81 million digital tracks in the United States and 11 million albums worldwide. She has also began an acting career in 2011, appearing in The Smurfs as the voice of Smurfette.

Katy has dated Gym Class Heroes frontman, Travie McCoy, Relient K frontman, Matt Thiessen, Russell Brand, and John Mayer. Katy and Russell married on October 23, 2010 in a traditional Hindu ceremony — but 14 months later, Brand filed for divorce. After her divorce, Katy was briefly been linked to Florence and the Machine guitarist, Robert Ackroyd. But she started a full-blown relationship with John Mayer in August 2012, and the two have been on and off ever since.

While Katy Perry was growing up, she became a part of her parent's ministry and sang in church from ages 9 to 17.
"Growing up I wasn't really allowed to listen to a whole lot of what my mom would call, secular music, and so I didn't have a whole lot of references as far as like, when the producer I was doing my demos was with was like, Okay so, who would you want to work with if you could work with anybody? I was like, I really have no idea." —Katy Perry
She grew up listening to gospel music and had limited exposure to what her mother called secular music. Katy attended Christian schools and camps. As a child, she learned how to dance in a recreation building in Santa Barbara. She was taught by seasoned dancers and began with swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug. She took her GED during her freshman year at Dos Pueblos High School, leaving school to pursue a career in music. Katy initially started singing "because I was at that point in my childhood where I was copycatting my sister and everything she did." Angela practiced with cassette tapes, and Katy took the tapes herself when her sister was not around. She rehearsed the songs and performed it to her parents, who suggested she should take voice lessons. She grabbed the opportunity and began taking lessons.
At the age of 15, Katy's singing in church attracted the attention of rock veterans from Nashville, Tennessee, who brought her there to polish her writing skills. In Nashville, she started recording demos and was taught by country music veterans on how to craft songs and play guitar. Katy signed to the Christian music label Red Hill, under which she recorded her first album at the age of 15. Performing as Katy Hudson, she released the self-titled album in 2001. The album was unsuccessful, however, after the label ceased operations in December 2001.
She later started using Perry, her mother's maiden name, as a stage name because "Katy Hudson" was too close to film actress Kate Hudson. At the age of 18 , Katy left her home for Los Angeles, where she worked with Glen Ballard on an album for record label Island. The album was due for release in 2005, but Billboard reported it also went nowhere. She was dropped by Island Def Jam Music Group. Some of Perry and Ballard's collaborations included "Box", "Diamonds", and "Long Shot", were posted on her official MySpace page. "Simple", one of the songs she recorded with Ballard, was released on the soundtrack to the 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.
She signed to Columbia Records in 2004. Unfortunately, the label was not amenable with her vision, not putting her in the "driver's seat". Instead, one of Columbia's ideas was to pair Perry with the record production team The Matrix, who was working on an album, to serve as its female vocalist. Although the album was later shelved, she caught the attention of the music press: Her burgeoning music career led to her being named "The Next Big Thing" in October 2004 by Blender magazine. With no album project ongoing, Katy began recording her own. Eighty percent completed, however, Columbia decided not to finish it and dropped her off the label.
While waiting to find another label, she worked in an independent A&R company called Taxi Music. In early 2006, she was featured in the tail-end of the video to P.O.D.'s single "Goodbye for Now". She made a cameo appearance in Carbon Leaf's video,"Learn to Fly", and in late November 2006 appeared in Gym Class Heroes' video, "Cupid's Chokehold", playing the eventual love interest of lead singer Travis McCoy. Her songs eventually captured the attention of Virgin Records CEO Jason Flom, then head of Capitol Music Group, who signed her to Capitol Music in early 2007.
After signing to Capitol Records, Katy began recording tracks for her second studio album One of the Boys, and establishing her image was one of the immediate concerns of her management. A campaign was started in November 2007 with the release of the video to "Ur So Gay", aimed at introducing her to the music market. A digital EP led by Ur So Gay was later released to create online buzz. This was a successful move that resulted in bringing Katy to the attention of Madonna, who mentioned her on KISS FM and KRQ's John Jay & Rich morning show in Arizona. On March 10, 2008, she appeared as herself on the ABC Family television series, Wildfire, on the episode "Life's Too Short".
While the buzz over Katy Perry was building, she went on the next step of promoting the album, undertaking a two-month tour of radio stations. The album's official lead single, I Kissed a Girl, was released in May 2008. With the song climbing atop the charts, they "establish her as a credible performer and make sure she isn't seen as just a one-hit wonder." The single was a commercial success, peaking at number one for seven weeks on the Billboard Hot 100. It has since become a major worldwide hit, topping charts in 30 countries, including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. On June 12, 2008, she appeared as herself on the daytime soap opera, The Young and the Restless, and poses for the cover to the June 2008 issue of the fictional magazine Restless Style.
One of the Boys was released on June 17, 2008 to mixed critical reviews. The album has reached number nine on the Billboard 200, and has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Her second single, "Hot N Cold", became her second top three single in dozens of countries around the world, including the United States where it reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping the charts in Germany, Canada, and Denmark. After Perry wrapped up her appearance at the Warped Tour, she went on tours in Europe. She later launched her first headlining tour, the Hello Katy Tour, in January 2009. I Kissed a Girl earned Perry a nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 2009 Grammy Awards. Katy was nominated in five categories at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, including Best New Artist and Best Female Video, but lost to Britney Spears. She won Best New Act at the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards, which she co-hosted, and Best International Female Artist at the 2009 BRIT Awards. On February 9, 2009, both "I Kissed a Girl" and "Hot N Cold" were certified three-time platinum by Recording Industry Association of America for individual digital sales of over three million.
The Matrix's self-titled debut album, which features Katy, was later released via the team's label, Let's Hear It, during Perry's solo tour. When the release date was scheduled, I Kissed a Girl had been charting well. Matrix member Lauren Christy spoke to Katy about the decision, but she wanted to hold the release until the fourth single of One of the Boys had been dispatched. Despite their communication, The Matrix was released on January 27, 2009, via iTunes Store.
During the summer of 2009, Katy Perry filmed a guest appearance for Get Him to the Greek. Her scene was cut, and does not appear in the final film. After the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, she would begin dating and later become engaged to Russell Brand, who starred in the film. They married on October 23, 2010. He filed for divorce on December 30, 2011, and notified her through text that their marriage was over. The two never spoke to each other again.
In 2009, Katy was featured on two singles: a remix of Colorado-based band 3OH!3's song "Starstrukk" in August (the idea for the collaboration came after her tour that featured 3OH!3 as the supporting act). The song was released over iTunes on September 8, 2009; and "If We Ever Meet Again", the fourth single off Timbaland's album Shock Value II, in December.
In October 2009, MTV Unplugged revealed that Katy Perry was one of the artists to perform for them, and that she would be releasing a live album of the performance, including two new tracks, "Brick by Brick" and Fountains of Wayne cover "Hackensack". The album was released in November 2009, and includes both a CD and a DVD.
    Her third album Teenage Dream was released August 24, 2010 in North America and August 30 worldwide. The first single from the album is titled "California Gurls". Capitol Records sent the song to U.S. radio on May 7, 2010. The single took only four weeks to reach the #1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100, making it the fastest rising single from a Capitol Records artist since Bobbie Gentry's "Ode to Billie Joe" in 1967. On July 22, Perry released the cover art for Teenage Dream, a painting by Will Cotton, which resembles the shots of Perry in the "California Gurls" video where she is lying naked on the cotton candy clouds. She also revealed that the booklet of the physical edition of the album will smell like cotton candy. On July 23, 2010, the album's second single "Teenage Dream" was released.
Katy released her own fragrance named Purr. It comes in a cat-shaped bottle, and is available in many countries including United States, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, England, Mexico and Australia.
She performed a version of her song "Hot N Cold" with Elmo from Sesame Street, which was originally scheduled to run on the 41st-season premiere of the educational children's program on September 27, 2010. Four days before the airing, Sesame Workshop announced, "In light of the feedback we've received on the Katy Perry music video..... we have decided we will not air the segment on the television broadcast of Sesame Street, which is aimed at preschoolers. Katy Perry fans will still be able to view the video on YouTube." The main reason was that parents complained about what appeared to be a great amount of cleavage shown by her dress. However, she was actually wearing a flesh-colored mesh that went all the way to her neck.
Teenage Dream led Perry to nominations four awards at the 2011 Grammy Awards: Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for "Teenage Dream", and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for "California Gurls". Following the Grammys, Perry embarked on an extensive world tour, California Dreams Tour (consisting of 121 shows) and released "E.T." as the fourth single from the album, the peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for five non-consecutive weeks. The single was a remixed version featuring Kanye West. The music video for "E.T." was directed by Floria Sigismondi and features Shaun Ross as the main love interest. With "E.T." at number one on the chart of May 12, 2011, Katy became the first artist in history to spend 52 consecutive weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. In June 2011, she released the fifth single "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)". A remixed version featuring American rapper Missy Elliot was released in early August. The single topped U.S. download and radio charts. The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 on August 17, 2011, making her the first female artist ever to have five #1 singles from one album and the peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for two consecutive weeks. In July 2011, she made her film debut in the 3D family film The Smurfs as Smurfette. The Smurfs had a hit performance at the box office, earning $557,771,535 worldwide during its theatrical run. Katy Perry appeared at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards on August 28, 2011. She was nominated for ten awards, received the most nominations of the ceremony and was the only singer in history to have four different music videos shown on various categories, eventually winning three of those, including Video of the Year for "Firework", Best Collaboration and Best Special Effects for "E.T.". On September 17, 2011, her 69-consecutive-week streak in the Top 10 ended.
On September 23, 2011, she attended the opening day of the 2011 Rock in Rio festival, which was extended to October 2. Other performers included Elton John and friend Rihanna. In October 2011, she released the album's sixth single "The One That Got Away". On the week ending October 23, 2011, Katy became the first artist ever to have 3 songs (Hot N Cold, California Gurls and Firework) sell over 5,000,000 digital copies in the USA. She also is the artist with the biggest 4,000,000-seller amount. On November 8, 2011, she had announced on her twitter that she will release her next fragrance "Meow", a following to her previous. The bottle is a cat-shaped bottle (similar to her previous fragrance), but is a more light-pink color with a "M"-shaped collar. She also hosted Saturday Night Live on December 10, 2011.
At the 2012 Grammys, Katy debuted her song "Part of Me". This song and "Wide Awake" (debuted May 2012) would be included in Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, the re-release of her Teenage Dream album. In June 2012, Perry revealed plans for launching her own record label, which will be an imprint of Capitol Records. She also became the new spokeswoman for Popchips. On September 25, 2012, Billboard named Perry 2012's Woman of the Year.
In early July 2012, her autobiographical movie Katy Perry: Part of Me was released in theaters. The film focused on her journey to fame as well as how her marriage to ex-husband Russell Brand fell apart. It also contained footage from her California Dreams Tour concerts. The movie received generally positive reviews. Later that month, she became the spokeswoman for Popchips. The following September, Billboard named her "Woman of the Year".
Katy released her fourth studio album Prism on October 18, 2013 in Ireland, Italy, Slovakia, and Slovenia, and worldwide on October 22, 2013. The lead single off of PRISM is titled "Roar" and debuted August 10, 2013. The song became Katy's 8th number one song on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, topping the chart for two weeks. It has also sold over 3.24 copies in the United States. Katy reprised her role as Smurfette in The Smurfs 2, which was released in theaters July 31, 2013. In August 2013, she released her third perfume "Killer Queen".
