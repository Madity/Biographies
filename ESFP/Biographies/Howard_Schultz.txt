Howard D. Schultz (born July 19, 1953) is an American businessman. He is best known as the chairman and CEO[3] of Starbucks and a former owner of the Seattle SuperSonics. He was a member of the Board of Directors at Square INC.[4] Schultz co-founded Maveron, an investment group, in 1998 with Dan Levitan.
In 2012, Forbes magazine ranked Schultz as the 354th richest person in the United States, with a net worth of $1.5 billion.[5]
Howard D. Schultz was born to a Jewish family[6] on July 19, 1953 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of ex-US Army trooper and then truck driver Fred Schultz, and his wife Elaine.[7][8] With his younger sister, Ronnie, and brother, Michael, he grew up in the Canarsie Bayview Houses of the New York City Housing Authority. As Schultz's family was poor, he saw an escape in sports such as baseball, football, and basketball. He went to Canarsie High School, from which he graduated in 1971.[9] In high school, Schultz excelled at sports and was awarded an athletic scholarship to Northern Michigan University[7] – the first person in his family to go to college. A member of Tau Kappa Epsilon, Schultz received his bachelor's degree in Communications in 1975.[8]
After graduating, he worked as a salesperson for Xerox Corporation and was quickly promoted to a full sales representative.[8] In 1979 he became a general manager for Swedish drip coffee maker manufacturer, Hammarplast,[7] where he became responsible for their U.S. operations with a staff of twenty.[8] In 1981, Schultz visited a client of Hammarplast, a fledgling coffee-bean shop called Starbucks Coffee Company in Seattle, curious as to why it ordered so many plastic cone filters.[8] He was impressed with the company's knowledge of coffee and kept in contact over the next year, expressing interest in working with them. A year later, he joined Starbucks as the Director of Marketing.[10] On a buying trip to Milan, Italy for Starbucks, Schultz noted that coffee bars existed on practically every street. He learned that they not only served excellent espresso, they also served as meeting places or public squares; they were a big part of Italy's societal glue, and there were 200,000 of them in the country.
On his return, he tried to persuade the owners (including Jerry Baldwin) to offer traditional espresso beverages in addition to the whole bean coffee, leaf teas and spices they had long offered. After a successful pilot of the cafe concept, the owners refused to roll it out company-wide, saying they didn't want to get into the restaurant business. Frustrated, Schultz decided to leave Starbucks in 1985. He needed $400,000 to open the first store and started the business. He simply did not have the money and his wife was pregnant with the first baby. Jerry Baldwin and Gordon Bowker offered to help. Schultz also received $100.000 from a doctor who was impressed by Schultz’s energy to “take a gamble”.[11] By 1986, he raised all the money he needed to open the first store 'Il Giornale' after the Milanese newspaper. Two years later, the original Starbucks management decided to focus on Peet's Coffee & Tea and sold its Starbucks retail unit to Schultz and Il Giornale for $3.8 million.
Schultz renamed Il Giornale with the Starbucks name, and aggressively expanded its reach across the United States. Schultz's keen insight in real estate and his hard-line focus on growth drove him to expand the company rapidly. Schultz did not believe in franchising, and made a point of having Starbucks retain ownership of every domestic outlet.
Schultz authored the book Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time with Dori Jones Yang in 1997. His second book Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life Without Losing Its Soul with Joanne Gordon, was published in 2011.
On January 8, 2008 Schultz returned as CEO of Starbucks after an eight-year hiatus.[12] At this time, Schultz was earning a total compensation of $9,740,471, which included a base salary of $1,190,000, and options granted of $7,786,105.[13] Schultz is a significant stakeholder in Jamba Juice.[14]
On the first of November 2013, it was announced that Schultz had stepped down from the board of Square, to be replaced by former Goldman Sachs executive David Viniar.[15]
Schultz is the former owner of the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics. During his tenure as team owner, he was criticized for his naïveté and propensity to run the franchise as a business rather than a sports team.[16] Schultz feuded with big name star Gary Payton, feeling that Payton disrespected him and the team by not showing up to the first day of training camp in 2002.[citation needed] On July 18, 2006, Schultz sold the team to Clayton Bennett, chairman of the Professional Basketball Club LLC, an Oklahoma City ownership group, for $350 million, after having failed to convince the city of Seattle to provide public funding to build a new arena in the Greater Seattle area to replace KeyArena. At the time of the team's sale, it was speculated that the new owners would move the team to their city some time after the 2006-2007 NBA season.[17] On July 2, 2008, the city of Seattle reached a settlement with the new ownership group and the SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder for the 2008-09 NBA season.[18] The sale to the out-of-state owners considerably damaged Schultz' popularity in Seattle.[19] In a local newspaper poll, Schultz was judged "most responsible" for the team leaving the city.[20] Before the city of Seattle settled with the Oklahoma City ownership group, Schultz filed a lawsuit against Bennett – in April 2008 – to rescind the July 2006 sale based on what Schultz claimed was fraud and intentional misrepresentation, perhaps trying to reduce the damage to his local image for having sold the team to out of state owners. However, Schultz quickly dropped the lawsuit in August 2008. When Bennett purchased the SuperSonics and its sister franchise in the WNBA, the Seattle Storm, for $350 million, he agreed to a stipulation that he would make a "good-faith best effort" for one year to keep both teams in Seattle. The sincerity of the good faith effort was widely disputed by the way Bennett acted and by direct quotes from his partner Aubrey McClendon. On January 8, 2008, Bennett sold the Storm to Force 10 Hoops, LLC, an ownership group of four Seattle women, which kept the team in Seattle.[21]
Speaking to CNBC in February 2009 about his concerns over the global economic crisis, Schultz said that "the place that concerns us the most is western Europe, and specifically the UK", which he considered to be in a "spiral", expressing concern with the levels of unemployment and consumer confidence in the country.
Lord Mandelson, the then-UK Business Secretary, responded saying that Britain was "not spiralling, although I've noticed Starbucks is in a great deal of trouble", and suggesting that Schultz was projecting his own company's trouble in the United Kingdom onto the wider national economy. Mandelson was later overheard at a drinks reception, saying: "Why should I have this guy running down the country? Who the hell is he? How the hell are [Starbucks] doing?"[22]
An official comment from Starbucks read that "It is a difficult economic situation in the US and around the world. Please be assured that Starbucks has no intention of criticising the economic situation in the UK. We are all in this together and as a global business we are committed to each and every market we serve."[22]
Chairman Howard Shultz is staunchly pro-Israel. In 1998, the Jerusalem Fund of Aish HaTorah gave him “The Israel 50th Anniversary Friend of Zion Tribute Award” for “playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the United States and Israel.” In 2002, Israel’s Foreign Ministry praised him for being key to the country’s long-term PR success, through his provocative speeches accusing Palestinians of terrorism, calling intifada resistance anti-semitism, asking Americans to back Israel against a common enemy, and sponsoring fund raisers for Israeli causes.
Jointly with the Israeli-based Delek Group, Starbucks Coffee International operated a joint venture in Israel, opened six stores, then shut them after heavy losses.[23]
In 1998, Schultz was awarded the "Israel 50th Anniversary Tribute Award" from the Jerusalem Fund of Aish Ha-Torah for "playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the United States and Israel".[24]
In 1999, Schultz was awarded the "National Leadership Award" for philanthropic and educational efforts to battle AIDS.[25]
The recipient of the 2004 International Distinguished Entrepreneur Award, presented to him from the University of Manitoba for his outstanding success and commendable conduct of Starbucks.[26]
On March 29, 2007, Schultz accepted the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., Award for Ethics in Business at the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame. The same night, he delivered the Frank Cahill Lecture in Business Ethics.[28]
Schultz became Fortune Magazine's "2011 Businessperson of the Year" for his initiatives in the economy and job market.[29]
In 1982, Schultz married Sheri Kersch;[8] they have two children:[2] Eliahu Jordan (born 1986)[30] and Addison (born 1982).[31] Their son Eliahu Jordan Schultz is a sportswriter for the Huffington Post. Eliahu married Breanna Lind Hawes in a civil ceremony in 2011; they were later married by a rabbi.[30][32]

Founded: 1971"I always wanted to do something to make a difference."-Howard SchultzEveryone knows Starbucks, the ubiquitous retail chain that, in the 1990s, turned coffee drinking into a national pastime. But few know Howard Schultz, the self-effacing chairman, CEO and mastermind behind Starbucks' astonishing growth. By bringing Italy's "coffeehouse culture" to the United States and packaging it for mass consumption, this maverick marketer transformed a little-known four-store chain in the leading retailer of specialty coffee in North America.Born in 1953, Schultz was raised in the rough and tumble Bay View housing project in Brooklyn, New York. His mother worked as a receptionist and his father held a variety of jobs, none of which paid much or offered such basic benefits as medical coverage for him and his family. When Schultz was 7, his father lost his job as a diaper-service delivery driver after breaking his ankle. At the time, sick pay or even legally mandated disability assistance were luxuries to those in low-paying jobs, and in the ensuing months, the family was literally too poor to put food on the table. It was a memory that Schultz would carry with him into adulthood.Determined to build a better life for himself, Schultz channeled his energy into high school sports and earned an athletic scholarship to Northern Michigan University. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in business in 1975, Schultz immediately began working in the sales and marketing division of Xerox Corp. Schultz excelled at Xerox, so much so that he attracted the attention of the Swedish housewares company Perstorp AB, which recruited him at the age of 26 to be vice president and general manager of their American subsidiary, Hammerplast USA.While at Hammerplast, Schultz noticed that a small Seattle company named Starbucks (after the first mate in Hermann Melville's classic Moby Dick) was buying an unusually high number of Hammerplast's espresso machines. Intrigued, he flew to Seattle to investigate and found four Starbucks outlets. Originally founded in 1971 as a single store near Seattle's famed Pike Street Market, Starbucks sold freshly roasted gourmet coffee beans as well as teas, spices and various coffee-making accessories.Impressed by Schultz's energy and marketing skills, Starbucks owners Gerald Baldwin and Gordon Bowker-who possessed very little business knowledge-asked Schultz to become part of their operation. Enticed by their offer, which included part ownership, Schultz joined Starbucks as head of its marketing and retail operations in 1982.A year later, during a vacation in Italy, Schultz had what he has described as an "epiphany." While sitting at one of Milan's many espresso bars, he realized that the coffee shop played an integral role in the social life of most Italians. It was a focal point for the neighborhood, where friends met, mingled and lingered at all hours of the day. "Seeing this, I thought to myself, 'Why not open a coffee bar in Seattle?' " Schultz recalls in an interview in The New York Times.Returning to Seattle, Schultz shared his epiphany with his fellow Starbucks owners. Although coffee was brewed in the shops, it was done so only at the request of customers and dispensed as free samples, and Baldwin and Bowker were unwilling to move beyond the stores' core product offerings.Convinced he had hit upon something big, Schultz left Starbucks in 1986 to open his own espresso bar called Il Giornale (The Daily). The venture was a hit. Schultz wanted to open more shops, but didn't have the funding he needed to expand. In a quirky twist of fate, a year later he learned that Baldwin and Bowker wished to sell their outlets, so after rounding up investors from the Seattle area, Schultz purchased the original Starbucks chain for $3.8 million and merged the stores with his own.Once in charge, Schultz set out to completely overhaul Starbucks according to his vision. In addition to the $1-per-cup "basic" brew, he expanded Starbucks' offerings to include more exotic coffee beverages such as espresso, cappuccino, cafÃ© latte, iced coffee and cafÃ© mocha. He also sought to create a more appealing atmosphere for his customers-the proverbial "clean, well-lighted place" where they could relax and enjoy their coffee in comfort.But the most radical change Schultz made was to improve the way his company dealt with its employees. Convinced that friendly, efficient service would boost sales, he instituted a training program designed to groom knowledgeable employees who would enjoy working behind a counter, an occupation considered by many to be menial labor. "Service is a lost art in America.it's not viewed as a professional job to work behind a counter," Schultz says. "We don't believe that. We want to provide our people with dignity and self-esteem, so we offer tangible benefits." Among the benefits Schultz offers is complete health-care coverage to both full- and part-time employees, as well as stock options, practices that are virtually unheard of in corporate America. As a result of Schultz's vision, Starbucks experienced unprecedented growth throughout the 1990s, blossoming from 425 stores in 1994 to more than 2,200 stores in 1998. And the company is on target to break the $2 billion in the year 2000.
With annual sales topping $1.7 billion in 1999, Starbucks Corp. reigned as the nation's No. 1 specialty coffee retailer. Quite an impressive achievement for a blue-collar kid from the projects. But despite Starbucks' phenomenal success, what Howard Schultz seems most proud of is not how much he has earned, but the kind of company he has created. "My dad was a blue-collar worker," Schultz explains in an Inc. magazine interview. "He didn't have health insurance or benefits, and I saw firsthand the debilitating effect that had on him and on our family. I decided if I was ever in the position to make a contribution to others in that way, I would. My greatest success has been that I got to build the kind of company my father never got to work for."The Benefit Of Benefits
Howard Schultz credits Starbucks Corp.'s benefits policy as one of the keys to his company's dramatic growth. By extending health benefits to all employees, Schultz has created a more dedicated work force and promoted an extremely high level of customer service. He has also achieved a turnover rate that is less than half the average of other fast-food businesses, saving the company countless thousands in training costs and enhancing its ability to attract and retain good employees. 
Another benefit that makes Starbucks stand out from its competitors is its stock-option plan. Dubbed "bean stock," unlike most plans, which are only available to top executives, Starbucks gives stock options to everyone in the company. "My aim was to give our employees a vested interest in the company," Schultz says. "And that, I think, has made all the difference."Cartoons And Coffee
One of the true "good guys" of the business world, Howard Schultz's philanthropic endeavors have extended beyond just helping his employees have better lives. One of his major philanthropic concerns has been helping to improve literacy in America. To this end, in 1998, Starbucks formed an unprecedented partnership with Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Garry Trudeau to create products to benefit local literacy programs across America. The collection marked the first time that a series of licensed Doonesbury products had been sold in retail stores. The series featured such Doonesbury characters as Duke, Mike, Kim and Zonker on T-shirts, tumblers, ceramic mugs, coffee gift cards and limited-edition lithographs.

What is Onward?In 2008, Howard Schultz made the decision to return as the CEO of Starbucks to help the company restore financial health and return to its core values. In Onward, he shares the remarkable story of his return, revealing how, during one of the most tumultuous economic times in history, Starbucks again achieved profitability and sustainability without sacrificing humanity. Now available in paperback.
It’s bringing 10,000 employees to New Orleans to rebuild hurricane-ravaged neighborhoods because—contrary to what critics feared—the emotional capital the event built would be well worth the cost. 
It's refusing to cut health care for thousands of part-time baristas, despite pressure from outsiders who insist doing so would save the company.
It's a journey that started 20 years ago in a northern California kitchen to develop a revolutionary product that most people insist will fail – and then successfully launching it.
It's admitting imperfection by closing thousands of Starbucks stores for an afternoon, at the cost of millions of dollars, to retrain baristas on the craft of pouring the perfect shot of espresso.
It's closing someone's favorite coffee shop forever, then asking talented people to leave the company, all with compassion and humanity.
It's a woman in the Starbucks corporate office in Seattle hearing about a coffee farmer in Rwanda who dreams of owning a cow so her children can have fresh milk – and granting that wish.

DownloadHoward Schultzchairman, president and chief executive officerIt all started with a cup of coffee.Howard Schultz, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Starbucks, first walked into Starbucks in Seattle’s Pike Place Market in 1981. Howard was invited into conversation with these connoisseurs who took great care in not only finding and roasting the highest quality coffee, but also sharing their passion with others. Drawn to Seattle and its extraordinary coffee culture, Howard moved from his native New York and joined Starbucks, in 1982, as director of operations and marketing when Starbucks had only four stores.A year later, in 1983, Howard traveled to Italy and became captivated with Italian coffee bars and the romance of the coffee experience. He had a vision to bring the Italian coffeehouse tradition to America. He wanted to create a place for human connection, conversation and one that fostered a sense of community – a third place between work and home. He left Starbucks for a short period of time to start his own Il Giornale coffeehouses and returned in August 1987 as chief executive officer to purchase Starbucks with the help of local investors. Today, Starbucks is the premier purveyor of the finest coffee in the world, with more than 20,000 stores in 64 countries.From the beginning, Howard set out to build a different kind of company. One that brings a sense of humanity and demonstrates respect and dignity. In these early days, Howard created two landmark programs that form the foundation of Starbucks culture. First, Starbucks offered comprehensive health coverage for eligible full- and part-time workers, among the first in the retail industry. Howard remains committed to health benefits despite the rising health care costs of the past two decades.Second, Starbucks offered partners (employees) equity in the company in the form of stock options, called Bean Stock. These early investments in people have proven that you can build a business that is profitable while sharing its success with Starbucks partners as well as the community.Chairman since 2000, Howard resumed the role of president and chief executive officer in January 2008. Since his return, he has led a transformation of the company, bringing the company to sustainable, profitable growth with a renewed focus on Starbucks coffee heritage, innovation and the customer experience. He has also galvanized leaders both inside and outside the company to take action to help local communities, including the effort he spearheaded in 2011 called Create Jobs for USA, a campaign designed to stimulate and preserve small business job creation.At the heart of the Starbucks Experience today, just as it has been from the beginning, is Starbucks mission to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.Howard has been recognized for his passion, his leadership, and his efforts to strengthen communities. Howard was named Fortune’s 2011 Businessperson of the year for delivering record financial returns for the company while leading an effort to spur job creation in the U.S. He has also been honored with the Distinguished Leadership Award from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, Horatio Alger Award for those who have overcome adversity to achieve success; the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh Award for Business Ethics given by Notre Dame University’s Mendoza College of Business; the Botwinick Prize in Business Ethics from Columbia business School; and the first-ever John Wooden Global Leadership Award from UCLA Anderson School of Management. He has also been included in Time magazine’s “Time 200,” a list of the most influential people in the world.Howard is the best-selling author of Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life without Losing Its Soul (2011), and Pour Your Heart Into It (1997). The profits from the sales of his books are donated to the Starbucks Foundation, which supports the company’s commitment to community; and the CUP Fund, which provides financial relief to partners facing emergency situations.Howard earned a bachelor’s degree from Northern Michigan University. He spent three years in sales and marketing with Xerox Corporation. Before joining Starbucks, he was Vice President and General Manager of Hammarplast U.S.A., a Swedish housewares company. He is co-founder of Maveron LLC, a venture capital group.Featured News

=======================================================
 Howard Schultz wasn't the first person to be carried away by the aroma of a well-roasted coffee bean. But the Starbucks Coffee Co. leader was undoubtedly the first to turn that reverie into a billion dollar retail operation.
Schultz's adventure started in 1981 when he traveled from New York to Seattle to check out a popular coffee bean store called Starbucks that had been buying many of the Hammarplast Swedish drip coffeemakers he was selling.
There was that great smell, sure, but what caused him to fall in love with the business was the care the Starbucks owners put into choosing and roasting the beans. He also was impressed with the owners' dedication to educating the public about the wonders of coffee connoisseurship.
"I walked away ... saying, 'God, what a great company, what a great city. I'd love to be a part of that,' " Schultz told myprimetime.
Schultz was born in 1952 and raised in a Brooklyn, N.Y., housing project. A football scholarship to Northern Michigan University was his ticket out, and after graduating he worked a variety of jobs until becoming manager of U.S. operations for Hammarplast.
It took Schultz a year to convince the Starbucks owners to hire him. When they finally made him director of marketing and operations in 1982, he had another epiphany. This one occurred in Italy, when Schultz took note of the coffee bars that existed on practically every block. He learned that they not only served excellent espresso, they also served as meeting places or public squares; they were a big part of Italy's societal glue, and there were 200,000 of them in the country.
But back in Seattle, the Starbucks owners resisted Schultz's plans to serve coffee in the stores, saying they didn't want to get into the restaurant business. Frustrated, Schultz quit and started his own coffee-bar business, called Il Giornale. It was successful, and a year later Schultz bought Starbucks for $3.8 million.
As the company began to expand rapidly in the '90s, Schultz always said that the main goal was "to serve a great cup of coffee." But attached to this goal was a principle: Schultz said he wanted "to build a company with soul."
This led to a series of practices that were unprecedented in retail. Schultz insisted that all employees working at least 20 hours a week get comprehensive health coverage -- including coverage for unmarried spouses. Then he introduced an employee stock-option plan. These moves boosted loyalty and led to extremely low worker turnover, even though employee salaries were fairly low.
Why was Schultz so generous? He remembers his father, who struggled mightily at low-paying jobs with little to show for it when he died.
"He was beaten down, he wasn't respected," Schultz said. "He had no health insurance, and he had no workers' compensation when he got hurt on the job." So with Starbucks, Schultz "wanted to build the kind of company that my father never got a chance to work for, in which people were respected."
Schultz has said that his model for expanding Starbucks is McDonald's, with a few key differences. One is that Starbucks owns most of its stores, while McDonald's franchises. Schultz doesn't believe it's possible to build a strong brand around franchises -- although McDonald's is an obvious exception. Another difference is that Starbucks managed to blossom without national advertising. Finally, Starbucks sells premium products to a fairly upscale, urban clientele.
Starbucks experienced astronomical expansion during the go-go '90s, going public in 1992. The company has almost 4,000 stores in 25 countries, serving 15 million people a week, and new outlets are opening so fast it has Wall Street's head spinning. The company seems to be immune to market vagaries as well, gaining 25 percent in stock value last year while the Dow Jones Industrial Index lost 10 percent and the Nasdaq 60 percent.
Schultz indulged his love of basketball by buying the Seattle Supersonics for $250 million. He also handed over CEO chores to Orin Smith so that Schultz can focus on global strategy. He believes that Starbucks is just getting started.
"Despite the success that Starbucks has enjoyed in the U.S., we have a less than 6 percent market share of coffee consumption," Schultz said. "We are in the infant stages of the growth of the business even in America. And now seeing what we've done internationally ... we are going to shock people in terms of what Starbucks is going to be."
Asked the secret of his success, Schultz recounts four principles: "Don't be threatened by people smarter than you. Compromise anything but your core values. Seek to renew yourself even when you are hitting home runs. And everything matters."

				Howard Schultz has earned a reputation not only as a business savant, but more recently as a progressive executive unafraid to speak his mind. From his pulpit as Starbucks' chairman and CEO last spring, he dressed down a shareholder who questioned the company's support of gay rights. He also recently told Oprah it's okay for men to cry -- even CEOs. Schultz has also been busy introducing new products to stimulate the Starbucks brand, including testing out "homemade" sodas and partnering with French yogurt maker Danone to offer a new Greek yogurt brand to customers. Schultz continues to grow the company globally, opening its first stores in Vietnam and India in the past year and announcing plans to enter Myanmar in the near future. So far, investors are happily guzzling the new strategies Schultz is serving. Starbucks' shares jumped more than 30% in the past year, increasing Schultz' stock-heavy fortune. Through venture capital firm Maveron, Schultz is also an investor in consumer businesses such as Pinkberry frozen yogurt, Lululemon activewear, eBay and Groupon. Schultz was raised in housing projects in Brooklyn, N.Y., and went to study and play football at Northern Michigan U. He later moved back to New York to sell kitchen equipment and housewares for a Swedish company before landing a marketing gig at a small coffee bean store called Starbucks. He traveled to Italy and was inspired to open an espresso bar in the U.S. His Starbucks bosses said no, so he started a rival store in 1985, making his java with Starbucks beans. He bought Starbucks from his bosses two years later for $3.8 million and took it public in 1992. Longtime chairman, he returned as CEO in 2008 after an eight year break to turn around the struggling retailer, and the company's value has nearly quadrupled since then.  [...] more
