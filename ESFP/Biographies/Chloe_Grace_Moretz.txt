      "This one day I was playing and I was swinging and I had my wires on and I flew off the edge and then I [panicked]. But they said, 'You're fine. You have wires on'." [In her scene on the top of the roof at The Amityville Horror (2005)].
      My mom has always said that if I get a big head, she'll take me out of this business as quickly as I got into it.
      If I ever uttered one word that I said in Kick-Ass (2010), I would be grounded for years! I'd be stuck in my room until I was 20! I would never in a million years say that. I'm an average, everyday girl; when I act with my friends, I'm totally immature, I have to go to bed at 9:30, and, if I'm up late on the computer, I lose it for two months.
      I hope to make acting my career for the rest of my life, if I can. If acting doesn't work out I'd love to produce, direct, or write. I just want to stay in this business. That would be my number one thing. I always want to be an actress.
      [on her stunts in Kick-Ass (2010)] I had amazing people training me. It was easy because I'd done ballet and gymnastics before. It all kind of went together and basically all of it was me. It was a really great thing.
      [on playing "Hit Girl" in Kick-Ass (2010)] It's a role - it's not meant to be taken as real-life. I was raised to think cursing makes you look unintelligent. As Chloe, I can honestly say I've never uttered a syllable of a curse word, not even behind closed doors.
      I think Mr. Martin Scorsese looked at me as a daughter figure because he has a daughter who is, like, 12 years old... he was very fatherly towards me.
      In my age range there's not many people to date... maybe Ryan Gosling... we could just drive around.
      When I was a little girl, I used to soak up everything... I would soak up like these huge, dramatic dialogues and start spewing them all the time.
      When you do a lot of kid movies, that can be a problem. You were a little sister type, and then all of a sudden you're a prostitute and people don't like it. Unless, like Jodie Foster, that's how you start off. And I'm similar because the first time anyone really saw me was in Kick-Ass (2010), killing people. So I don't think I'll have that kind of trouble.
      I have two gay brothers and two straight brothers, and my gay brothers were treated horrifically until they grew up and understood how to deal with it. I will delete you, and I will block you, and you will not be a part of my life if you ever say anything bad about my brothers. My mom has always taught us that blood is thicker than water. No one will ever understand the dynamic of your family. Ever. We are the closest family ever and we are the most insane family ever. It may look weird to others, but to us, it's life.
      arding the bullying of her family via Twitter] I have two gay brothers and two straight brothers, and my gay brothers were treated horrifically until they grew up and understood how to deal with it. I will delete you and I will block you, and you will not be a part of my life if you ever say anything bad about my brothers.
      [on her parent's divorce and her mother's cancer diagnosis] It made me realize, along with everything that happened with my dad, that your parents aren't these godly figures. They're not chosen by the heavens. They're humans. Their bodies can fail and they can die at any moment. They make mistakes. They cry. They fight. It definitely, from a young age, put everything into perspective for me.

From All Movie Guide: Chloë Moretz made a major impact at a young age, impressing audiences with her tough talking performances in 2009's (500) Days of Summer and when she was just 11. A Georgia native, Moretz made her on-screen debut with a role on the series The Guardian in 2004 and would spend the next few years making appearances in films like Big Momma's House 2 and Bolt. Following her memorable performance as Joseph Gordon-Levitt's no-nonsense little sister in (500) Days, the young actress would make an even bigger splash with her grasp of adult language, playing cold-blooded killer Hit Girl in 2010's Kick-Ass. She would then play the best friend to the title character in Martin Scorsese's award winning Hugo, and appear in Tim Burton's big-screen adaptation of Dark Shadows. ~ Cammila Collar, Rovi

	Teen actress Chloë Moretz has captivated film-goers in movies like Kick Ass, Let Me In and Diary of a Wimpy Kid. This holiday season get ready to have the 14-year-old starlet steal the scene again playing Isabelle in Hugo, the wondrous story of a boy who lives in a train station. Find out more about Chloe in her Kidzworld bio.
Chloë Moretz was inspired to be an actress when she moved with her older brother to New York so he could go to acting school
Chloë starred as a teen vampire in the American remake of Let Me In, originally a hit underground Swedish film
	Chloë Grace Moretz was born in Atlanta, Georgia. Her mother Teri is a nurse practitioner and her dad, Cory, is a plastic surgeon. With four older brothers Chloë is officially the baby of the family, and she describes her family as very religious. Chloë originally moved from Atlanta to New York with her mother and older brother Trevor because he was accepted into a performing arts school. Little did he know, his little sister was picking up tricks of the trade with him, but her career really took off when they moved to Los Angeles in 2003. Chloë immediately started landing small roles on shows like The Guardian and Desperate Housewives.
	Chloë got her big break in the remake of the classic based-on-a-real-story horror movie, The Amityville Horror, which came out in 2005. Critics immediately took notice of this fresh new talent, and Chloë received a Young Artist Award nomination for her performance. Meanwhile, her brother Trevor who inspired her career turned into her acting coach, and sometimes still attends openings and premieres with Chloë. Chloe continued to get TV and smaller film roles, but landed her next big break in the graphic novel-turned superhero success Kick Ass! Chloë’s character curses throughout the whole film in language that she advises is not meant for “anyone under 18!”
“If I ever uttered one word that I said in Kick Ass I would be grounded for years! I'd be stuck in my room until I was 20! I would never in a million years say that. I'm an average, everyday girl; when I act with my friends, I'm totally immature, I have to go to bed at 9:30, and, if I'm up late on the computer, I lose it for two months,” said Chloë.
	Chloë’s career was taking flight after Kick Ass, and her next big role was one she could really sink her teeth into-literally! Chloë played a teen vampire in the American adaptation of an award-winning Swedish vampire flick, Let Me In. Chloë spent all of last winter filming the new enchanting and visually stunning  Martin Scorsese movie Hugo, based on the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret. Starring heavyweight actors Ben Kingsley and Sasha Baron Cohen, Hugo revolves around a young boy trained to fix clocks (and so much more) who lives in a train station and uncovers a mystery with the help of a girl (Chloë.)
	Check out the trailer for Hugo below!

I literally cannot wait to see this movie!! It comes out tomorrow, but I already have my tickets of course. I've read the book 7 times already, and I cry every single time. The story and characters are perfect. Hazel Grace & Augustus Waters are life okay. John Greene will remain the best author, in my opinion. Just so psyched to see this movie :D!!!!
