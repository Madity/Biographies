=======================================================
Dana White (born July 28, 1969) is an American businessman, entrepreneur, and the President of the mixed martial arts organization Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).
Dana Frederick White Jr. was born to Dana White Sr. and June White on July 28, 1969 in Manchester, Connecticut. White and his sister Kelly were raised by his mother and her family the majority of his childhood. Dana is Irish-American.[1] He graduated from Hermon High School in Maine in 1987.[2]
While working as a manager for Tito Ortiz and Chuck Liddell, White learned that Semaphore Entertainment Group, the parent company of the UFC, was looking for a buyer for the UFC. White contacted childhood friend Lorenzo Fertitta, an executive at Station Casinos, and a former commissioner of the Nevada State Athletic Commission. Within a month, Lorenzo and his older brother Frank bought the UFC, with White installed as its president.[3] White owns 9% of Zuffa, LLC, the entity the Fertitta brothers created to own and manage the UFC.[4]
Prior to becoming president of the UFC, White was an unofficial amateur boxer as no record of his fights exist. He was also a boxing trainer. White is married and has 2 sons and a daughter.
In May 2012, White revealed that he had been diagnosed with Ménière's disease.[7] The UFC on Fuel TV 3: "Korean Zombie vs. Poirier" event was to be the first he had missed in 11 years with White staying home as per doctors orders. White is undergoing Orthokine treatment for Ménière's disease which he says has greatly reduced his symptoms from the disease.
In 2007, Dana White accused Top Rank Boxing Promoter, Bob Arum of "sucking the life out of the sport (boxing) and not putting anything back in." Amongst White's criticisms were that Arum had created a weak undercard for the De La Hoya-Mayweather fight in 2007 saying Arum did not promote the show correctly. "He promoted that show completely the wrong way, because he worried about the money as opposed to trying to secure the future", White said. "He should have stacked that card. He should have had Shane Mosley and Bernard Hopkins and (Marco Antonio) Barrera and Winky Wright on there and used it to show that boxing is back". Arum responded by saying that MMA fighters need to examine the revenues being generated and ask why the UFC wasn't paying them more. [8] White has also said that Bob Arum is the "Dumbest promoter in the History of the world", an "Idiot" and a "Moron." Arum also stated that MMA fighters are "guys rolling around like homosexuals on the ground." Earlier in the year, Arum described UFC President Dana White as "nuts" and "a little too much of a loose cannon." [9]
White and former UFC Light Heavyweight and Heavyweight champion Randy Couture have had some controversy. White stated in an interview that he has "no respect for Couture, not even a little. The only time when he's ever a man is when he steps in that cage." He stated that Couture "Lied to me, not even to my face, not over the phone, but through text" about Couture doing a deal with Spike and Bellator.[10]
Among White's many feuds, his most publicized has been his feud with former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion and UFC Hall of Famer Tito Ortiz. Their feud began soon after White became president of the UFC when he told Ortiz he could no longer be his manager. Ortiz felt betrayed. Tito Ortiz then stated that White "Never did anything for him," and White stated he did not get paid "a fucking dime." Their feud got to the point to where the two agreed to fight in a three-round exhibition boxing match.[11] Eventually, Ortiz pulled out of the match by not showing up the day of the weigh-ins. In 2014, White even stated in an interview that "I used to beat the living shit out of Tito Ortiz."[12] In 2008, At the weigh-ins for UFC 84 Ortiz wore a t-shirt saying "Dana is my Bitch." [13] White also stated in an interview that Ortiz is the "Cheapest Motherfucker on the planet Earth." [14] In 2013, Ortiz called White a "Slave master" and White responded by stating that Ortiz was a "Fucking buffoon" and "One of the dumbest motherfuckers you'll ever meet." [15] In 2014, Ortiz accused the UFC of "Erasing my legacy." [16]
White had been very vocal about his dislike with former UFC Heavyweight Champion Ken Shamrock. Shamrock had been known to ally himself with other fight promotions competing with the UFC, have litigious contract disputes with White, and take issues with White personally. There was also one point when Shamrock filed a lawsuit against White, in which the judge ruled in the UFC's favor. White stated that Shamrock owes him money for that lawsuit and stated that he had done so much for the former UFC great and felt the MMA legend was ungrateful for his efforts. [17]
In December 2010, White donated $50,000 to the Francisco Espinoza foundation. White donated approximately $8,000 to help pay for the brain tumor treatment of two-year-old British girl, Ruby Owen. The young girl's family had described themselves as being "shocked and over the moon". Ruby Owen's uncle, being a UFC fan had contacted White via email and asked if he could help by donating to the Ruby Owen fund raising website. White and Owen have never officially met.[18] He gave $300 to one man who said that he "just received a speeding ticket while racing across town to meet him".[19] Shortly after being named 2009 Nevada Sportsman of the Year, White added $100,000 from his pocket to the $250,000 total raised for the fund raising marathon sponsored by ESPN Radio 1100 for Las Vegas.[20]

Dana White Biography Introduction:Some people think it's great when they're able to grow a plant.  Well, how about taking an idea with a couple of friends/business partners and re-growing it into the greatest mixed martial arts organization on the planet?  
In the end, that's exactly what current UFC President Dana White helped do.  And the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) would not be the company it is without him.  So without further ado, here's his story.Date of Birth:Dana White was born on July 28, 1969 in Manchester, Connecticut.Before MMA:White moved around quite a bit as a youth, transitioning between Boston, Las Vegas, and Maine.  Eventually, he graduated from Hermon High School in Maine in 1987.  Around that time, the amateur boxer settled in Boston where he made his bread as a bouncer and bellman, amongst other things.  
White eventually attended the University of Massachusetts for two years, but dropped out.   Along the way, he launched a boxing program for inner-city children and started a boxaerobics business that did quite well in the late 1990's. That is, until the Irish mob reportedly wanted their cut, which prompted him to leave for Vegas.Discovering Jiu Jitsu:White certainly didn't mind street fights in his early years. "He's always been very tough," Joe Cavallaro, a former boxer and friend of White's reinforced in an MMAFitness article. "I think Dana could have fought pro. . . He's got a real nice jab, and there's nothing you're gonna do to outgut him."
While in Vegas, White became reacquainted with multimillionaire Lorenzo Fertitta, a former classmate, casino owner, and Nevada state boxing commission member. Eventually, the two took a jiu jitsu class and were sold on its effectiveness.  This, perhaps, was what led to the the Fertittas' eventual acquisition of the UFC.Dana White The Manager:While working as a manager in Vegas, White represented both Tito Ortiz and Chuck Liddell, whom would eventually become bitter rivals.Dana White UFC President:White got to know Art Davies of Semaphore Entertainment Group in Vegas, the parent company of the UFC.  So when Davies told him that he was looking for a buyer, White contacted his friend, Lorenzo Fertitta.  This led to the Fertittas purchasing the UFC (Lorenzo and Frank). In turn, the Fertittas created Zuffa, LLC, in order to oversee their MMA organization, and named White its president. White currently owns 10% of the company.White's Style As President:White doesn't hold back any punches. On The Ultimate Fighter reality television show telecasts and at news conferences, he often says what he thinks and does so without worrying about his language. This kind of thing has endeared him to some and caused others to dislike him. What's more, he's been known to verbally attack moves by other MMA organizations and their fighters, likely in an attempt to maintain the UFC's status as top dog in the MMA world.
Regardless, no one can argue that his take no prisoners management style has been a major reason why the organization has grown and dominated the MMA landscape to date.Personal Life:White is married to Anne.  They have three children together, two boys and one girl.

       "If your an MMA fan you need to read this book. ...." -Cameron Conaway"Really enjoying Dana White's moms book about her son, check it out for some good soul food."Frank Shamrock - UFC Fighter"Anyone who likes or hates Dana White should take a look at this." - The Fight NerdGreat book, guys go buy the book and read it. If your a Dana White fan, check out this book. If your a Dana White hater you need to read this book. - MMA_Kingdom, King JB"MMA fans only get to see one side of the Dana White story now a whole new world has opened up through the eye's of the woman who gave birth to him and has seen him evolve into the man we know today as the President of the UFC."  -The Fight Nerd
       This book is not just another book on mixed martial arts. It is the story of mma's biggest promoter of mixed martial arts in the world, and a very controversial sports management figure. The reader gets to see Dana's life from the beginning to present, his family background, the struggles Dana endured for 4 years before the UFC finally turned a corner and began to make a profit and the person his wealth, fame and power has created. This all through the eyes of his mom, who from day one was one of his biggest supporters and now possibly one of his biggest critics.
      June White born 1950 in Hartford, Ct. to Irish/American parents, 5 siblings, 2 children, 5 grandchildren. Raised her children as a single mom. Lives in NH at the beach, refers to this as her flip flop years.

  Save your money and more importantly your time, don't bother reading this!MattI understand that Dana may have some shortcomings but after reading this book I have more sympathy for Dana and respect that his success came despite poor parenting.Daniel B. PattersonAt the beginning of the book is a list of some of the photo captions, which is incomplete and out of order, making the whole thing even more confusing.P. Brusyo
  I'm a huge MMA fan and have a large collection of MMA books and fighter biographies.  I learned of this book when the hacker group Anonymous got into a brief online war with Dana White & posted a lot of his personal information.  Naturally, I was eager to learn more about the man behind the UFC's success.  I'm not a DW "nuthugger" by any means - I was really hoping for some interesting dirt on the guy.Unfortunately, this book doesn't really provide that - nothing worthwhile anyway.  Instead, this book appears to have been written by a VERY bitter mother with a huge axe to grind.  According to his mom (the author), Dana & her were very close most of their lives.  Then when he became successful with the UFC, he turned into the devil she always thought he was, and abandoned his family and friends.  I'm not exaggerating either - this lovely woman told of the day she gave birth to Dana and how she looked into his eyes and thought they were "soulless".  By page 8 of this book, you realize what you're getting into and what kind of person his mother is.  This book doesn't make Dana White look bad, it makes his mother look bad.  REALLY bad.Besides what appears to be a book filled with bias, coming fron one side of the story, it's also a complete unorganized mess.  The entire book she jumps around to different points in their lives, making it hard to keep track of what happened when.  Even the photos are unorganized - there's a bunch of photos, printed very small, without captions.  At the beginning of the book is a list of some of the photo captions, which is incomplete and out of order, making the whole thing even more confusing.Unless you collect MMA books like me, don't waste your time and don't give this nasty woman the few bucks she's looking for.  Even if it was well written & interesting, it's only approx 130 pages with large font, so hardly worth the cost to begin with.
For those who love MMA and the UFC, this is a good book to add to the collection.  Books on MMA and the UFC can swing wildly from the very good (Forest Griffin's "Got Fight" and Big John McCarthy's "Let's Get It On") to the not bad (Chuck Liddell's "Iceman" and Brock Lesnar's "Deathclutch") to the mediocre (BJ's Penn's "Why I Fight" and Randy Couture's "Becoming the Natural").  This book is really a bit of an oddity and is for those looking to add to their history of MMA and the UFC. Written by Dana White's mother, June White, it tells of the rise and fall of Dana White as a person.First off, the bad:  the writing style is rambling and is in desperate need of some quality editing. Instead of a cohesive story progressing in a linear fashion, it jumps around and spends way too much time on Dana White's childhood escapades. I'd have much rather read about the early days of the UFC, the struggles, the near second death of the UFC before the Ultimate Fighter resurrected it and started it on the path to becoming the multi-billion dollar international juggernaut it is today. There is so much history in how Dana White and the Fertitas, through sheer force of will, kept this thing alive.  Instead we get very little of that, and the book ends up feeling more like a cross between a lecture from mom for blowing curfew and a relative who gets mad when you tell them you won't loan them some money or crash on the couch.The good: it does give some insight into Dana White, who for all his public persona, remains a fairly guarded man when it comes to his backstory, his family and what drives him (every interview that gets personal gets the standard line of "it's not work, I love what I do, blah blah blah").Read more ›
  I've read a number of MMA biographies, this has to be the WORST of them.While reading this I could only think, with a Mother like this, who needs enemies.It was just the ramblings of a bitter old woman that wishes she was the most important thing in her sons life!Save your money and more importantly your time, don't bother reading this!
7 of 9 people found the following review helpfulAwful mother says she had Rosemary's baby, hates her child.
  This not a book but a rambling piece of garbage, who claims when she first saw her child who was born a few months after Rosemary's baby, that because her son had dark pupils, she Also had Satan's child. This is a sick woman trying to cash I on her sons success. It's boring and sad.
  Dana White is probably not the most loveable guy on the planet, but this book is disgraceful. Mrs. White clearly wrote this book for the sole purpose of using Dana White's fame in an attempt to hurt him in what may be the only way left to her - by airing whatever dirty laundry she could think of, even reaching all the way back to his infancy.This book has no literary value what so ever and, while it is an attempt to attack the character of Dana White, what it more clearly does is expose the bitterness of an often absent, frequently intoxicated and chronically bitter woman who is trying to use her son's success to snatch her own 15 minutes of fame.I've never met Dana White. If I were Dana's media coach I would advise him to soften his approach and his vocabulary, but if Dana is in fact a hostile, angry, or volatile person - this book provides many incites as to how he may have become that way.Mr.s White, it is you who should be ashamed. Any mother who would write in this manner about her son deserves to be ignored.
      I agree with the other reviewer, there is indeed two sides to a story and I am quite certain this book only sheds light on one version.
      I'm not a Fan of MMA or boxing, this book was a gift from my daughter.I truly loved this book about a mothers love for her son, and the hardships this women faced as a single...
      Thought the book was a very good read. Although it isn't exclusively about MMA, it is worth having for anyone interested in the life of the UFC president, Dana White.
      For those who love MMA and the UFC, this is a good book to add to the collection. Books on MMA and the UFC can swing wildly from the very good (Forest Griffin's "Got Fight" and Big...
      I have a huge love for the UFC and have been a true fan for a long time. I have surmounts of respect for Dana White for what he has done and accomplished.
      His dad left and his mom works 80-100 hours a week. You pawned off your responsibility on relatives and left him to be raised on the streets.
      Thumbs up! I read the whole book straight through without stopping.It's hard to imagine that Dana grew up like a normal little kid, made it to the big time and then forgets...
      I recently just finished reading this book on Dana White.  Thought it was well written and seems like a very believable story.

Former street tough Dana White rescued the Ultimate Fighting Championship and transformed the mixed martial arts organization into the hottest sport in America. Get out of his way because he's not stopping now. And besides, you just might get hurt.
Most corporate titans don't look like this. It's hard to picture Donald Trump rolling into a shareholder meeting sporting a fresh shiner from one of his employees. And you definitely won't see Warren Buffett tossing up 300 pounds on the bench press. Thirty-eight-year-old Ultimate Fighting Championship(UFC) president Dana White may now have the boardroom cred of other business bigwigs, but with his round-shouldered build and two faint but permanent red lines along the edges of his nose (courtesy of a sparring partner), he mostly resembles just another fighter. And that's perfectly fine with him.
Indeed, White's tenure as the guiding force behind the rise of the UFC as the newest "fastest-growing sport in America" is best described as a knock-down, drag-out brawl in which he's now the undisputed champion. Nearly worthless and tainted by controversy less than a decade ago (the sport was not sanctioned by most states), White has helped elevate mixed martial arts (MMA) into the mainstream and transformed the UFC, the first MMA organization, into the biggest—and most surprising—success story in sports.
Acquired in 2001 for $2 million by White and other investors, the UFC now fills arenas in North America and Europe, produces a hit cable series (Spike TV's The Ultimate Fighter) and has smashed the all-time pay-per-view record. In 2006, the UFC generated more than $200 million in pay-per-view revenue, outperforming boxing and pro wrestling. Last year, Time magazine estimated the UFC's value to be over $1 billion.
What was once a fringe, dark-alley sport—infamously described as "human cockfighting" by Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee—is now as Middle American as it gets. In February, the UFC secured a multimillion-dollar sponsorship deal with beer giant Anheuser-Busch that in May placed the Bud Light logo on the floor of the sport's unique Octagon fighting ring. And don't be surprised if White lands a major-network television deal soon, perhaps even before you read this article.
A former working-class tough in South Boston who bolted town to elude extortion from the Mob, White may not yet be among the pantheon of sports' most powerful commissioners and executives. But he's right outside their door and he's got a couple of badasses with him. In fact, Dana White just may be the next most powerful guy in sports.
It's been an unlikely journey for the unlikely sports mogul. At 18, after living in numerous cities, White, an amateur boxer and lifelong martial arts aficionado, settled in "Southie," where he didn't mind proving himself regularly in bar and street fights. He worked as a bouncer and later as a bellman at the Boston Harbor Hotel. While the hotel job paid the bills, it also stood in the way of White's true passion: boxing. 
"He's always been very tough," says Joe Cavallaro, a former boxer and friend of White's from the hotel, and now the owner of MMA promotion World Championship Fighting. "I think Dana could have fought pro. He was thin back then, but with big, big arms and big shoulders. He's got a real nice jab, and there's nothing you're gonna do to outgut him."
In time, White ran an inner-city boxing gym and started a boxaerobics enterprise akinto what Tae Bo would become in the late 1990s. This caught the attention of the Irish mob, which pressured him to offer them a cut of the action. White chose instead to return to Las Vegas, where he had spent several of his high school years. There, he opened boxing gyms and began managing fighters. He also became reacquainted with former classmate and multimillionaire Lorenzo Fertitta, a casino owner who was serving on the Nevada state boxing commission. The two, along with Fertitta's brother, Frank, discussed starting their own boxing promotion company.

I am ushered into Dana White’s personal office by his charming public-relations guru, and before she can introduce us, he emerges: bald, beaming, suddenly and surprisingly charismatic, wearing hip-ripped jeans and a T-shirt and mumbling through the white madness, “Hi! Come in!” All I see at first is white foam, bubbling at smiling lips, the kind of lather you might expect if you allow yourself to believe in the supernatural, particularly from a man crazy enough to go from hotel valet in Boston to instructor to, thanks to some nudging by the Boston mafia to get the hell out of dodge, a Vegas man. And to, a few short years later, multimillionaire and face and force behind mixed martial arts, one of the country’s fastest rising sports. I am too stunned to speak. And then I see the toothbrush. I exhale and realize the president of the UFC is, in fact, merely brushing his teeth. Still, this candid look at a complicated man serves as the perfect introduction in a two-day blitz, on the verge of UFC 137, to Dana White and his fast-paced world. It will turn out that White, a 42-year-old mesh of controversy, cunning, charm, vision and intensity, is everything his newfangled PR machine wants you know about him — and everything they want you not to know. White, at this exact moment, is simply the guy disappearing back into the bathroom, the guy barking orders as he reemerges, the guy dictating tweets on the fly and the guy rushing next door to watch every second of an upcoming UFC promo with the methodical precision of a control freak. He needs to be at the Mandalay Bay like, right now, but he takes the time to go frame by frame, shot by shot. He is certainly the guy for whom every last moment, detail and piece of control still matter deeply. The triumphic music ends. The computer screen goes blank. The room waits. For the first, and perhaps only, time in this two-day burst of personality, Dana White whispers. “I like it.” There is palpable relief. “I want to see the Mitre line one more time. If I like what we’ve changed I want to tweet it.” This, too, is Dana White — a man who approves, shapes and is responsible for almost every aspect of the UFC. It will soon become clear that Dana is also much, much more. He is the guy who gives vast sums of money to charity, has stayed loyal to childhood friends and interacts with genuine affection with fans no matter how busy he might be. He is the guy who won $200,000 the night before — yes, more than most of us make in a year — at the blackjack tables at Caesar’s Palace. Who put down another $35K on the Cardinals to beat the Rangers in that miraculous Game 6, which, of course, he won, followed by a similar score betting on the Cards in Game 7. He is certainly the guy who talks about these things and more, even as his PR staff makes it very, very clear he should not be. Dana White is the guy whose bare-knuckled approach to negotiating, ambition on behalf of the UFC and himself and embrace of all things Vegas — he likes to say, particularly when his lead PR person tries to cut down on the candor, “We’re men! She doesn’t get it!” — has made this failed boxer, onetime fight manager and pejorative spewing bald dude an all-powerful MMA force who's equal parts dictator and visionary. Some hate him. Some love him. Some fear him. Some resent him. Some respect him. Some see a brilliant, game-changing, hard-charging catalyst at the center of the rise of the UFC and mixed martial arts. Some see a wildly magnetic bully they can’t stand. Many see him as some combination of these things. Either way, for the next 36 hours, we’re going to see him up close. It will be a rare, behind-the-curtain glimpse of an Oz-like figure ruling over an increasingly lucrative and relevant part of the American sports landscape. And that is largely true because Dana White is — as best as one can discern through the layers of obfuscation, powerful personal performances, natural charm and well-oiled public-relations machine — the kind of nuanced person perfect for taking a blood sport like mixed martial arts and selling it with unprecedented success to the general public. * * * Dana White doesn’t really walk. He struts. He glad-hands his way along a route filled with fans, sycophants, friends and admirers. He puts his barrel chest out and pushes at a pace that’s not quite running, not really menacing, but something other than a casual gait. He moves like the coolest bouncer from Boston might, all confidence and personality and inexplicable likability. Perhaps it doesn’t seem like walking because, even if he’s the one moving, people are drawn to him. It rarely seems the other way around.  This is how he leaves the nondescript headquarters of the UFC, with a vibe that seems out of place among the drab scenery, In-N-Out Burger and general malaise of this very ordinary stretch of Vegas. “This FOX thing is huge,” he says, nodding toward me. FOX Sports, the company for which I work, recently announced a seven-year deal to air UFC fights on its various networks, the first of which premieres Saturday, live at 9 p.m. ET on FOX. It is a very big step toward White’s goal to turn MMA into one of the premier sports on earth. Some see the deal as proof the sport has entered the mainstream. We head to his silver Range Rover — me, White and his head of public relations, Caren Bell, part of a new and impressive team hired to help sell the UFC and White to the world. He tells Bell he’s going to get her hooked up on his Twitter account. “Type this in for me. Say . . . ” He drives fast. He drives while he stares down at his phone, tweeting or texting or whatever he’s doing; accelerating while he looks down at his phone. I swear he takes a sharp turn like we’re on rails while he looks down and works his phone. My first overriding impression of the man is: no fear. He’s talking about how UFC is becoming a mainstream sport when his phone rings. He puts his phone to his year. “Yeah.” He listens. “Are you s****** me?” Listens. “Where you at?” Listens. “Haul ass up there.” Hangs up the phone. As if White himself can control, through force of example, whomever he was talking to, the bald man to my left accelerates again, the motor humming, and goes back to working his phone while we move swiftly onward. The Range Rover moves past what you think of when you think of Vegas, zipping past the monuments to the left that American sin built in the desert through the sheer profit behind it. First, though, before joining White in one of those palaces of pleasure, we need to pause for his past, for something Dana White rarely talks about. Something he was not, in fact, convinced he had talked about before. (He had.) Behind us, where the Bellagio now stands, is where booze, blood, fate, glass and a girl nearly wiped from this earth the man behind the rise of the UFC. * * * He is going fast. He must be. What’s about to happen makes it definite even if years later he cannot recall the exact miles per hour. He is 16 years old. He has been drinking; that is certain. The girl next to him is not his girlfriend; that is certain, too — as is the fact the car he’s driving with the girl who’s not his girlfriend nonetheless belongs to his girlfriend. It’s a wild ride in Vegas about to get wilder. He is on the strip. The casino in question is the Dunes. One minute it’s a joy ride. The next it’s glass and blood and pain. “Thrown out the door,” White recalls years later. “The door peeled on this f****** car, like wrapped around the pole, and had this big f****** gaping hole and shot me out of it. Remember black Reeboks? I had black Reeboks on. There were little pieces of black Reeboks all over the f****** car. My feet exploded on impact. Is that crazy? And I held onto the wheel so tight the wheel was broke. Broke my collarbone. Both feet exploded on impact. And my knees were f*****. And it scalped all the hair off of my head.” So here is Dana White, 16, head scalped, feet a mess, darkness around him. The sounds of madness and chaos everywhere. Then voices. “At the time, there was this commercial where people would die — it was a life insurance commercial — people would die, and while they were dead they could hear everything everyone was saying,” White says. “Then some guy comes and gets them and they start going up an escalator to heaven. That was the commercial at that time. I remember laying there and people screaming, and people freaking out, and I remember hearing a guy say, ‘I’m a doctor! I’m a doctor!’ And he comes in and says, ‘He’s dead!’ “And I remember thinking, ‘Holy s***! I’m f****** dead!” Years later, White will laugh at this. Laugh with such gusto everyone listening leans in a little closer and laughs, too. That’s the thing about the big moments that shape you. Their horror, if they don’t destroy you, take in an element of humor; their power becomes as much about the moment itself as those moments later when we reflect on it. This is how our most important and private experiences shape us into the people we become.  “I could hear what he’s saying,” White goes on. “I’m like, ‘Holy s*** I’m f****** dead!’ It’s just like that Prudential commercial or whatever it is! So I’m waiting for someone to come get me. When he said it I remember the girl with me starts f****** screaming. Screaming. And the next thing I know he said, ‘Oh! Oh! I got a pulse! He’s alive!’ and I’m like, ‘F****** thank God!’ ” White laughs the whole time he tells the story, but had he died there, had Dana White expired as just some drunk kid crashing his girlfriend’s car into some casino’s parking lot while with some random girl, it is certainly conceivable many of us wouldn’t even know what the UFC is. Because then, White, about 15 years later, would not have been there to ask childhood friends Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, executives of Station Casinos, to spend $2 million to buy a fledgling company in the long-shot belief they could make MMA a preeminent sport and the UFC its primary engine for profits and popularity. One can make a very compelling case that in that casino parking lot, coated in blood and glass and pain and darkness, lay not just Dana White but the future of the UFC itself. * * * He did survive, and the UFC is now what it is, and so we return to the present and the whirlwind of the day before a big fight. White steps out of his Range Rover behind the Mandalay Bay and heads into the casino, Goodfellas style. Down this hallway, then the other, then another, shaking hands, following a very urgent woman who snaps, “This way please!” wholly encased by the unvarnished background of a very cool casino. White does some interviews via satellite and heads back to his dressing room. There, he pulls out a stack — a very thick stack — of $100 bills and counts out 30 of them. He turns to one of his employees. “Just go find Artie and give him this.” He sees me eyeing this very Goodfellas-style transaction. “The $3,000 is for this dude I went to high school with,” White explains. “He’s the St. Louis tipster. What he does is he gives me picks all week and I give him a piece. He’s damn good, man. I don’t know how the hell he’s doing it but he’s damn good.” White’s PR person chimes in, “Are you really pulling out that money in front of him?” White laughs, but the question — and the persistent PR machine that frets all weekend about his every word and my every observation — speaks to just what he is. He’s the franchise. These furious attempts to control the message do no extend to the fighters, not to this extent. Dana White is the face of his very important, quite lucrative company. That’s half the reason he’s hired a new PR team. There’s much more to protect now than even a few years ago. White has gone on talking — talking about fights, about why he thinks UFC is poised to be the biggest sport on earth, about how, unlike the NFL, it has reach outside the United States, about how . . . The phone rings. “Hold on.” Through the phone I can make out a familiar diminutive voice asking what time they can meet up. “Whatever, bro. You tell me whatever time you want to meet, and I’ll meet you.” White hangs up. “Mike. Mike Tyson.” The amazing thing about this exchange is not that Tyson called Dana White. It’s the realization just how much more important White is to the fight world than the former boxing champ. Times have changed. A bit later we head out, and the rest of the afternoon is a rush. White glad-handing, hugging friends, pretending to know strangers, weighing in fighters on stage, breaking up a fracas at the weigh-in between headliners Nick Diaz and B.J. Penn and afterward exulting in their three-second dustup. “That was f****** beautiful! That was better than an interview!” When White gets back to his dressing room, a short guy with glasses and an impressive build is waiting. White gives him a hug. The dude plops down on a chair, and after a few moments it comes up that he surfs. And that, while surfing, he cracked open his skull on some crazy swell. And then this dude is pulling out one of his teeth — some kind of device is secured to the tooth, and wires run up the back of his skull — and White laughs uproariously. Old friends, turns out. That’s the other thing about White. He has friends, close friends, whom he’s known for years, guys who remain an active part of his life. He’s as bonded to his past with guys like the surfer — he’s a lawyer — as he is to Mike Tyson or Simon Cowell, with whom he partied earlier in the week. Somewhere along the way, a suggestion I might get to party later in the night with White and his buddies becomes a hard and fast invitation. While this is going on, and while Bell is urging that we do not in fact spend un-chaperoned time together, one of White’s people reads a long quote about how lucky we all are to be here. It’s a Robert Dawkins quotation that will play some role in some upcoming UFC promo or marketing campaign. “We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones,” the man reads. “Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.” There’s a pause while we wait for White’s reaction. “That is some deep s***,” he says. By now, Bell, who is very good at her job and thus a little concerned about all that’s transpired, been talked about and been promised, is blatantly unhappy about the prospect of the face of the UFC partying it up in front of a reporter. White doesn’t care. He’s still dwelling on Dawkins. He turns to me. <p> “We’re the sperm that almost didn’t make it! Let’s go get f****** crazy tonight!”   Sounds good to me. But first, before that, we need to take one more look back. Because the Dana White who’s living the high life in Vegas was shaped by his time in Boston in the late 1980s and early '90s. This, as much as partying past midnight in Vegas with him, is what his handlers don’t want you to know. * * * White moved to Boston after high school. Bartender. Construction worker. Bellman. That was the life trajectory of Dana White. Solid money. Normal life. A tough kid doing just fine in a very tough town. One night, he was out with his sister when all hell broke loose. He was leaving a bar when he went back in to check on her. “My sister has a completely different story these days, but I’m telling you this is what happened,” White says. “She said f****** that guy was pointing at her and saying all this s****. The bar’s closing and we’re all going outside and my sister says, ‘That’s him over there.’ “And I’m like, ‘Did you hit my sister?’ And he’s like, ‘What?’ ‘Did you hit my sister?’ He’s acting like it wasn’t him. My sister walks up beside me and he goes, ‘Oh, you mean this big-mouthed f****** b****?’ and gives her the face mush. Right? So I f****** hit this dude as hard as I could.” The guy, the way White tells it, took three steps backward and then charged. Along with every other dude there. “These guys were from Charlestown,” White said. “It felt like there were 1,000 of them, but there were probably 15 or 20 guys. They beat the s*** out of me for 20 minutes until the police came. I kept popping up and going back down, popping up and going back down. “And then the police came. I lost the hearing in this ear. The reason the kid got in trouble was because he started fighting the police when they came, too. A lot of times people get stabbed . . . ” So make no mistake. White might not have made it as a boxer, and he might be one bright businessman, but he’s also experienced real violence. Whatever it is about MMA that touches some primitive part of us, White doesn’t just know how to sell it. He once lived it. “I got a call from the lawyer one day,” White said. “I could barely move the next day I was in so much pain. My ears were ringing for days. I’d go over and pick up the f***** phone because I thought the phone was ringing, that’s how bad my ears were ringing. “The lawyer called to see if I’d testify against (his client) and he’s talking and talking and talking to me and I go, ‘Wait a minute. Is he there?’ He’s like, ‘Yes, he’s sitting here right now.’ I said, ‘Put me on speaker phone.’ "He puts me on speaker phone and I’m like, ‘You and all your f***** punk-ass p**** f****** friends f****** beat on me for 30 f******* minutes and nothing happened to me! I wasn’t sore! I wasn’t this or wasn’t that. One of these days me and you are going to see each other again and none of your p**** friends are going to be with you and it’s going to be a different story!’ And I hung up the phone. I didn’t want to go, ‘I lost my hearing and I couldn’t walk for 10 days after that.’ ” Still, asked if he testified against any of the people who beat him senseless for half-an-hour, he answers as if it’s the craziest thing he ever heard: “Hell no.” Violence aside, he did well in Boston. Got himself a job at the Boston Harbor Hotel, where he said he pulled in as much as $70,000 a year. Had benefits. Made good money. A nice life. “I was standing in that lobby one day, and I said, ‘This isn’t for me.’ ” He quit that day and opened a box-ercise class in Boston. I ask Dana why he left Boston, what got him back to Vegas, having already heard the reason and wanting to know if the mafia really played a part. When I ask, Caren, his public-relations person, shoots me a smoldering look. “Why did I leave Boston! Ha-ha!” White says, looking at her as well. “I just got tired of it, jumped up one day and left all my s*** there!” “Thank you,” Bell says, relieved. “Is that the answer you wanted?” “Absolutely, very good.” He’s still laughing. “I got so sick of that s*** and one day I said, ‘F*** it,’ bought a plane ticket and left everything there. My girlfriend and everything. Left it all there.” He lays on the sarcasm. “I’m very impulsive.” He pauses, and you can see his eyes gleam and almost hear him think, “Who gives a s***!” “You know that story right?” I nod. It’s just the kind of story his handlers hate for you to hear, because the last thing they want are the words “Dana White” and “UFC” to in any way appear near “mafia.” “So it’s true?” I ask. “One-hundred percent true.” “Can we just talk off the record on this stuff,” Bell interjects. White ignores her. “If you look at mafia movies, mob movies like ‘The Godfather,’ they’re really sophisticated, but the reality with gangsters is it’s more like the Johnny Depp movie ‘Donnie Brasco.’ They’re sawing off f****** parking meters to try and break into them. That’s really what it’s like. It’s guys trying to make money any way they can, whether shaking people down or something else. That’s what they do. One day they walked into one of my classes, literally walked into the middle of one of my f****** classes and said, ‘Yeah, we need to talk to you.’ I’m like, ‘I’m teaching a class.’ They’re like, ‘Yeah, we need to talk to you.’ “We walk into the hallways and one’s like, ‘Do you know who I am?’ I was like, ‘No,’ but the way this thing was going down I had a feeling who it might be. It wasn’t (Boston mafia figure) Whitey Bulger. It was two of his guys. Kevin Weeks was one of them. ‘You owe us $2,500.’ ‘Really? Well that sucks.’ ” They knew White had a girlfriend, knew where he worked, probably knew where he lived, and the implications were clear. So when they called a few days later, he bought a ticket to Vegas, slipped aboard a plane and ran to a brand-new life. * * * That, perhaps as much as having survived the teenage car wreck, is why he’s sitting here now at the Marquee Nightclub at The Cosmopolitan, squished between a reporter and Chuck Liddell, drinking a Bud Light from a can, being told he’ll be needed in five minutes. Otherwise he might not have arrived in Vegas, discovered Tito Ortiz and Liddell, managed them, worked his way into the MMA hierarchy and changed the sport. We’re here to launch the UFC’s latest video game, “UFC Undisputed 3.” Reporters wait across the room, eager for some one-on-one time with White. Beautiful women circle us. Part of his nervous PR team listens in with apprehension. Their concerns are reasonable and telling: They say White has nothing to hide but that he does have enemies. That he’s a great guy who has a great time, but some might take it the wrong way. That his bare-knuckled approach to life helped make him the man he is, but now that that man is the face of a very valuable franchise perhaps he should stop talking about fights, the mafia, teenaged drinking and driving and the other moments that made him who he is. And, certainly, not spend un-chaperoned time with a reporter. Listening to such concerns, White interjects. “No! We’re going out!” Again, his PR person grimaces. And smiles. It’s hard not to like Dana White, it really is, but if you’re tasked with shaping his image, well, that would be a lot like herding cats. Not very easy. “I’m a guy!” he goes on. “I’m a man’s man! This is Vegas, and I embrace this f****** town! I embrace what it was built on. My PR people are acting like we’re going to snort lines of coke and bang hookers. No, man. We’re guys, we’re going to play cards and drink and be men.” Needless to say, Bell both laughs and looks horrified. Hookers and coke? Oh, God. Unsolicited, White barrels on. “I hate drugs. I hate them! Don’t want them f****** around me. I brought a buddy out, and he was involved in drugs, and I had to get rid of him.” Now he runs through the gamut, unasked, of the tougher questions I might ask. Yes, he once used a derogatory term to describe gay people and he says he gets it now, gets why that is not a word to use. Yes, he has enemies and can be tough, but this is Vegas, this is America, and a man makes his own way. No, he doesn’t want to talk about his family — he'll say only that he has a wife and kids — and why not? Every man’s entitled to his family being off limits, certainly when you have a mom — as White does — who seems to revel in making videos for the public in which she slings awful accusations his way and is writing an unauthorized biography. “We have had guys who make mistakes,” he says, talking about his fighters. And maybe about himself too. “But we’re f****** human beings. We’re all going to make mistakes.” A little more than 24 hours later, after Diaz abuses Penn in UFC 137, White announces that Diaz will indeed fight Georges St- Pierre for a title fight over Super Bowl weekend. Another fighter, Carlos Condit, has “agreed” to step aside and pass on a title fight he’d had a few hours earlier. This is almost certainly a unilateral decision by Dana White. That speaks to how much power he has, and also to why the UFC has grown so much. They bring about the fights fans want to see because the power rests not with the fighters but with White. So who he is, the good and bad, it all matters if the UFC matters, as well. I like White. He’s cool, he’s funny, he’s refreshingly open and honest. I would not want to piss him off outside a bar, or at a negotiating table, or necessarily be one of his employees. But I would love to drink beer with him, take in Vegas with him and watch, with or without him, this sport he’s introduced me and many others to. The fact is, he is the result of all the things he’s shared, which means the UFC has been shaped by them, as well, regardless of what his PR staff wants us to focus on when we focus on the man behind the UFC. Dana White is the guy who nearly died in that parking lot. Who wouldn’t stay down outside that Boston bar. Who was forced out of Vegas by the mafia. Who ended up back in Vegas, took a shot on someone else’s money on the UFC and made them all a boatload of money. Who says his stake in UFC is worth about $400 million. Who can win $200,000 playing blackjack on a given night. Who good-naturedly but without reservation throws his handlers’ caution in their faces. Caution? This man’s life was built on the opposite of caution. So it comes as a surprise when he slips out of the nightclub and, a little later, fires off a text telling me he’s going to bed early rather than showing me the town. Which is fine. Dana White does what Dana White does — and whether that’s sleep or get crazy away from some reporter or ignore people paid to give him advice he shouldn’t ignore, well, more power to him. All weekend long, he’s said one thing to me over and over. Watching him, from the moment he brushed his teeth all the way through UFC 137 and his clear and total control over it and the fights to follow, his words ring loudly in my head. “I have a great f****** life, man. I’m not going to lie. I do.” That life, and the man it made, is as responsible as anything else for the current state of mixed martial arts. “I’m not ashamed of who I am. I’m the luckiest f****** guy alive.” *Cain Velásquez vs Junior Dos Santos Free TV transmision on Fox Deportes 9:00 pm.

MMA UFC bio Dana WhiteFor the latest Martial Art news and information, visit WWW.BigDawgMartialArts.com
This series was started as a way to provide information for MMA fans, especially newer fans with information about the fighters that they watch. Before I get too far into the fighter bio’s, I felt it was important to discuss the background of the man who is responsible for us having the sport of MMA, UFC president Dana White. There are some fighters who have openly and publicly bashed Dana for the way he does business, and some fans believe he is too arrogant and cocky. I contend that being a fighter and being around fighters just naturally makes one a little cocky, and I respect someone who will stand up in public and speak his mind regardless if it pisses people off.
Dana White was born in Manchester, Connecticut, put spent his childhood bouncing back and for between Las Vegas, Maine, and Boston. At the age of 18, Dana settled down in South Boston. In Boston, he attended college for a couple of years but never finished. He worked as a bellman at the Boston Harbor Hotel, and as a bouncer to make money, and was known to frequently prove his fighting abilities in bar and street fights. Being an amateur fighter, White’s true passion was boxing. He started an inner-city boxing gym and developed a box-aerobics class, which would later be referred to by Billy Blanks as Tae Bo. The Irish mob controlled most of the south side of Boston, and Dana’s business eventually caught their attention. Unwilling to do business with the mob, Dana packed a suitcase, leaving every thing else behind, and moved back to Las Vegas, where he spent several of his high school years.
Back in Las Vegas, Dana opened a boxing gym, teaching aerobics classes, and managing fighters. He reacquainted himself with one of his high school classmates, Lorenzo Fertitta, when he came to Dana to train him. Lorenzo was now serving on the Nevada state boxing commission and was a multimillionaire casino owner. Along with Lorenzo’s brother Frank, the three of them were planning on starting a new boxing promotion, but after meeting John Lewis, a UFC fighter, they got interested in submission fighting and started training with him in Jiu-Jitsu. Impressed with his success as a boxing promoter, two unknown fighters at that time, Tito Ortiz and Chuck Liddell approached Dana who agreed to manage them.
At that time, the UFC had a bad reputation and was being outlawed in almost every state. The UFC was in a financial crisis and looking to sell. Dana approached Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta and convinced them that the UFC, with some changes, could be a marketable company. For a price of $2million, the Feritta brothers bought the UFC, and gave Dana White a 10% stake in the company, and put him in charge of running the company.
To make the UFC a success, Dana had to clean up the image and find someplace to market it. White added several rule changes to make the fights more exciting and to put fighter safety first, including strict medical exams. The increased fighter safety was enough to convince Nevada and New Jersey to sanction the UFC fights. The next step was to get the UFC back on T.V., and he employed tactics such as bringing fighters with him to negotiations. 85% of the fighters he began marketing were college grads, and were intelligent and well spoken. These tactics works and he managed to get the cable companies to put the UFC back on Pay-Per-View. Dana has since brought the sport of MMA mainstream with his excellent ability to manage live events, making the fighters accessible to the fans, and his successful deal with Spike to air the Ultimate Fighter Reality show has brought the sport mainstream.
One interesting fact that many UFC fans are unaware of is that Dana White almost stepped into the boxing ring with one of his fighters. Bad blood between Dana and Tito Ortiz developed after Dana bought the UFC, and unable to manage and promote, Dana referred Tito and Chuck Liddell to one of his friends, who was an attorney, to manage. Although Liddell has never shown any animosity, Tito felt like Dana was always giving him the short end of the stick and not paying him as much as he though he should make. The bad blood got even worse over the years, and the in the last contract Tito signed with the UFC, he demanded a boxing fight with Dana. The fight was supposed to be shown on Pay-per-View with the proceeds being donated to charity. Dana trained hard to get back into shape, and jumped through hoops with the Nevada State Athletic Commission to get his fighting license and sanctioned to fight Tito. Tito kept trying to change the conditions of the fight, including using smaller gloves and no head gear, but Dana agreed to all of Tito’s terms. The Nevada state athletic commission scheduled the weigh-ins and waited several hours for Tito to show up, but he never did. The athletic commission called off the fight. Tito, who had apparently found out how hard Dana was training, and that he was doing very well boxing against much more experienced boxers, decided that he didn’t want to take a chance on getting embarrassed so he didn’t show up to the weigh-ins trying to save as much face as he could.

Name: Dana WhiteBorn: July 28th, 1969Company: UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship)Position: President of UFCDana White currently has a net worth of an estimated:$180,000,000Information:Dana White, born July 28th, 1969 in Manchester, Connecticut, is the current President of the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship). 
Prior to becoming President of the UFC, Dana White worked as a boxing and aerobics instructor. White became involved in the world of mixed martial arts when he began managing Tito Ortiz and Chuck Liddell, who would go on to become two of the sport's biggest stars. 
While serving as a manager to Ortiz and Liddell, White became aware that Semaphore Entertainment Group, former parent company of the UFC, was looking for a buyer for the mixed martial arts organization. Dana contacted one of his old childfriend friends, Lorenzo Fertitta (of Station Casinos), about the possibility of purchasing the UFC. Lorenzo, along with his brother Frank, bought the UFC for $2 million a short while later. Dana White was named President and was reportedly given 10% of Zuffa, LLC, which was the company that Lorenzo and Frank formed to purchase the UFC. 
The UFC lost tens of millions of dollars before finally turning around and growing into the multi-billion dollar organization that it is today. Some of the key inflection points for the UFC were:
The company has slowly but surely won mainstream acceptance and regulatory approval, and is now sanctioned in nearly every US state (New York is a notable exception) and many countries throughout the world. --Zuffa, LLC is a privately held company, but here is the widely rumored ownership structure:
Flash Entertainment bought a 10% stake in Zuffa, LLC in early 2010. The purchase amount has not been disclosed. 
In 2008, Forbes valued the company at "$1 billion-plus", based on estimated sales of $250 million. The UFC did 5.1 million PPV buys in 2007. 
The sport is significantly bigger now than it was in 2007. The emergence of stars such as Georges St. Pierre, Jon Jones and Brock Lesnar (retired) have helped push the UFC to even greater heights. 
In addition, the UFC has found significant new markets in Canada, Australia and Brazil, and also recently inked a seven-year deal with Fox that will reportedly pay the UFC $100 million per year. 
Taking into account recently acquired assets (Strikeforce, WEC), the Fox deal, the incursion into wildly successful new markets (Canada, Brazil, Australia), the upcoming move into new, potentially lucrative markets (India, China) and the company's $425 million term loan that is due in 2015, I would guess that the UFC currently has a value of $2 billion+. 
A valuation of $2 billion would value Dana White's stake in the company at $180,000,000.

The Fight Nerd   –  “Dana White, King of MMA” – review of the tell-all biography by Dana White’s mom
body { background:#F6F6F6 url('http://www.thefightnerd.com/wp-content/themes/Avenue/images/patterns/pattern1.png') repeat; }
Dana White, the president of the UFC and most polarizing man in MMA. If you are on his good side, you can be set for life. Hit a nerve with him and consider yourself permanently banned. I look forward to reading his autobiography when the day comes for that book, but while we wait we have something possibly better. 
DFW’s mother, June White, has written her own biography about her son titled Dana White, King of MMA, and for lack of a better term, leaves it all in the cage. This tell-all book pulls no punches, but is this thing legit or hard to swallow? Even if it’s believable, is it worth your time and money? Let The Fight Nerd help you decide that with this book review!
The book starts off with three eclectic quotes, one from an uncredited writer at Yahoo! Sports, one from the movie “Superman”, and one from Teddy Roosevelt. Why is this odd? Well, firstly the quote from the movie is “It’s not who you are, but what you do that defines you”, and that is actually from “Batman Begins”. Off to a good start already. The quote from Yahoo is actually a quote from Dana himself, but it’s given no context, and lastly the Teddy Roosevelt one, which is “Character, in the long run, is the decisive factor in the life on an individual.” The book does not need three quotes to begin with, when only the Roosevelt one fits anyway. Furthermore, misquoting Batman is a no-no in this nerd’s book. Believe it or not, those misquotes get worse as this book goes on.
June White makes it very clear early on that her son is both a President and a King, but “dictator could be another of those titles”. Her plan for this book is to explain why, and show who her son was and is now. “I like Dana’s transformation to that of Precious in “Lord of the Rings,” she wrote. “Just as the ring of power changed that fictional character, Dana’s power and wealth have changed him into someone I do not recognize.” I think she meant Gollum, since the only fictional character named precious that I can think of a is a morbidly obese Black girl. 
Nerdy nitpicking aside, June paints a portrait of a child who was once caring and sweet who was suddenly transformed into a wealthy man of power with a cold heart. When June was pregnant with Dana, she was misdiagnosed with a heart disease that would supposedly kill her in a year, but things worked out fine or else there would be no book. As a baby, June compared Dana to “Rosemary’s Baby”, with the blackest eyes she had ever seen that made her think he was born evil, but his eyes eventually turned to a normal shade of less Satanic tones. 
June gives us a detailed account of Dana’s youth and important family members that helped to shape his life. There are many stories about Dana’s drunken and abusive father and the hard life they had as a family. Want some dirt on a young DFW? He memorized Dr. Seuss books at age three, was chased by an angry rooster as a teenager, and his grandfather thought he was gay. There are many more telling stories about his childhood, namely how he always enjoyed being the center of attention. Intermingled with the tales of Dana is the story of June, who set out to escape from Dana Sr., leaving Florida to take refuge with her mom in Connecticut, and then finally ending up in Massachusetts and Las Vegas. 
One of the things that shocked June the most was how her son had become an atheist. The author related stories about how much a young Dana loved church and how their Priest would say how inquisitive he was about God and thought he was destined for Priesthood. Instead, Dana has forsaken his religious upbringing for reasons that June believes is because Dana thinks he is a God. This seems to be the item that bothers June the most, since it comes up very frequently throughout the entire book, and is one of the first things she tells us when she discusses her son.
There are many “myths” about Dana that the author debunks, including the hard life of Dana growing up on the mean streets of Southie and Vegas all alone. According to his mom, she was there for every minute of his life and has the stories to back it up. She also tells us that Dana never had a college education, despite him saying that he does. 
As Dana began to grow into adulthood, he became a person with no sense of humor and a very controlling personality. He was a lazy kid who could not apply himself in school and never took to working much until he got involved with boxing and Peter Welch. In a twist of fate, a fallout between the two over money led to Dana retreating to Vegas on his own, where he started “Dana White Enterprises” and became the boxercise teacher we all know and love.
Without getting into too many details about the story, June takes many little stabs at Dana in her book, mostly at the end of a paragraph to punctuate her sour relationship. They come as after thoughts, like she was trying hard to be mean to him when deep down she is still his mother and loves him unconditionally. There are plenty of fun stories about Dana, as much as there harsher ones that villainize him. 
In an ironic moment in the book, June typifies Dana as being like a union fighting for better pay and work conditions for his fighters back when he first took over the UFC. As soon as he became a part-owner in the company, his priorities changed and that while he has continued to try to make things better, he has also made the transition much harder under his reign. What seemed to hurt his mother the most was how Dana never mentions anyone in his family, be it herself, his sister, grandparents or anyone, and how he pushed them completely out of his life as his fame grew. June attended every UFC for the first three years and helped him monetarily in many ways before then, but the end came when Dana became verbally abusive to her in public on several occasions. 
Technically speaking, this book is full of typo’s, some only a few sentences apart from each other. After the second nerdy nitpick I caught, I came to the realization that this was self-edited and that I would be in for a long ride if I complained about every grammatical mistake. For example, June’s brother George was a black belt in the art of Tae Ka Won Do, and she distinctly remembered a spectator at the early Zuffa UFC’s in Jersey named Tank About. Consider this a warning, dear readers, that your eyes will be assaulted with all manner of misspelling, so do your best to not let that ruin your experience if you choose to pick this up. 
The book is a short read, clocking in at 136 pages, a few of those being full-page photos or relics from this past like his birth certificate and a hand-written letter he wrote as a youth. Even at that length, is it worth the read? While not being the most well-written piece of literature, you can tell it comes from the heart and the lack of editing reinforces that for me. It reminds me of when I read my grandmother’s autobiography; it was filled with bad spelling, awful grammar and a generally bland writing style, but what did I expect from a 70 year old immigrant who was not a professional writer?
The raw writing style comes off not as unprofessional, but more real. These are the words of a mother who has something to say and wants her voice to be heard. MMA fans only get to see one side of the Dana White story, now a whole new world has been opened up through the eyes of the woman that gave birth to him and has seen him evolve into the man we know today as the President of the UFC. June gives us the most candid look we could have without being there in person to show us what made the “King of MMA” and what drives him to act the way he does. 
You can buy this book for $9 on Smashwords, but there is currently a 25% off deal on the site through the end of this month, so at that price any person who likes or hates Dana White should take a look at this. 
Check out my previous book reviews here, including UFC cutman Jacob “Stitch” Duran’s autobiography, Anderson Silva’s newest MMA instructional book, and Jonathan Snowden’s MMA Encyclopedia!
If you buy it, you won’t wonder any more if it’s real.  If it wasn’t, you’d have heard by now, because someone would be being hunted, and public denials would’ve been made.  The silence should tell you this:  nobody with a public image to protect wants to sue his own mother.
yes, I was one of the people banned just for bringing up the subject of June White’s book. That proves to me that Kirik Jenness is bought and sold by Zuffa!!!
The wife has been friends with Dana’s sister for years & i can tell you Kelly is humiliated by her mother book and claims most of what she said about brother Dana is either not true or very exaggerated.
This woman had 2 kids, Dana & Kelly. She has 5 grandchildren- 2 by Kelly and 3 by Dana. NONE of them have ANNNNNNYTHING to do with June White because she is vindictive, greedy, nosy and a pathological liar.
What June left out was that she had physical relationships with her brothers & father well into her teens Three of those “fucks” ended in abortions.
She ran around on Dana’s & Kelly’s father which is why HE left HER. He was trash for not seeing the kids, though. Can’t defend him on that one. Can’t blame him, either.
June’s brother, George Wills, is a drunk & a junkie and if you check with the courts you’ll find he is being sued by his own children for ripping them off following the death of their mom. 
June’s only sister, Francis, has battled her heroin addiction her whole life and the other brother, Richard, had to have a new liver because he drank his away. He likes the needles and good stuff, too.
Heck, most of the cousins on Junes side of the family live in or around the Vegas area and have awesome relationships with Dana & Kelly. The cousins don’t really communicate with their parents/aunts/uncles anymore because they are trash so LOL@ June for coming across like it’s only Dana!
