Alecia Beth Moore Hart (born September 8, 1979), better known by her stage name Pink (stylized as P!nk), is an American singer-songwriter, actress and model. Originally a member of the girl group Choice, she began her solo career with the 2000 single "There You Go", which was also included on her debut album, Can't Take Me Home, released later that year. The R&B album went on to be certified double-platinum in the United States. She gained further recognition upon collaborating with Lil' Kim, Christina Aguilera and Mýa for a cover of "Lady Marmalade" for the 2001 Moulin Rouge! soundtrack. That cover earned Pink her first Grammy Award (for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals) as well as her first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100.
Although she originally faced opposition from her record label, Pink aimed to make her second album more personal and more pop rock-oriented. The product, 2001's Missundaztood, proved to be her most successful album to date, with sales in excess of 12 million copies. The album's biggest singles, "Get the Party Started", "Don't Let Me Get Me", and "Just Like a Pill", all charted in the top ten in the US and the UK, with the latter becoming her first UK-number one. In November 2003, Pink released her third album, Try This, preceded by the single "Trouble". Although not her most successful album, Try This earned Pink her first solo Grammy Award, for best female rock vocal performance.
After a short hiatus, her fourth studio album, I'm Not Dead, was released in April 2006. With the help of successful singles "Stupid Girls", "Who Knew", and "U + Ur Hand", I'm Not Dead marked a revival in Pink's popularity, both in the US and worldwide. Pink's fifth album, Funhouse, was released in late 2008 and was preceded by her first solo number one on the Billboard Hot 100, "So What". The album was certified double-platinum in the US and prompted Pink to go on the record-breaking Funhouse Tour. Her first compilation album, Greatest Hits... So Far!!!, was released in November 2010 and produced two chart-topping singles, "Raise Your Glass" and "Fuckin' Perfect". Her latest album, The Truth About Love, was released in 2012 and became her first number one album in the United States. The album's three singles, "Blow Me (One Last Kiss)", "Try", and "Just Give Me a Reason", all reached the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100, with "Just Give Me a Reason" becoming her 4th number-one single.[3]
Pink has become one of the most successful artists of her generation, having sold over 45 million albums, including nearly 16 million in the United States,[4] and 65 million singles worldwide as of 2014.[5] Her career accolades include three Grammy Awards, a Brit Award, and six MTV Video Music Awards. Additionally, Pink has had 19 top-twenty hits on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2009, Billboard magazine named Pink the #1 pop musician of the decade,[6] in 2012 VH1 named Pink #10 on their list of the 100 Greatest Women in Music, and in 2013 Billboard named Moore the Woman of the Year.[7][8]
Alecia Moore was born on September 8, 1979,[9] in Abington, Pennsylvania, to Judith (née Kugel),[10][11] a nurse, and Jim Moore, a Vietnam veteran.[12][13][14] Her father is Catholic and her mother is Jewish. Pink has ancestors who emigrated from Ireland, Germany, and Lithuania.[15][16] Although a healthy baby at birth, she quickly developed asthma that plagued her through her early years.[17] Pink grew up in Doylestown, where she attended Kutz Elementary School, Lenape Middle School, and Central Bucks High School West. Her father played guitar and sang songs, thus inspiring Pink from an early age to be a pop star. She was also a gymnast for eight years; she stated in an interview that her first dream was to be an Olympic gymnast.
When she was just a toddler, her parents began having marital problems, and before she was ten her parents had divorced.[10]
Pink developed her voice early in life. In high school, Pink joined her first band, Middleground, but it disbanded upon losing a battle of the bands competition. As a teenager, she wrote lyrics as an outlet for her feelings, and her mother commented, "Her initial writings were always very introspective. Some of it was very black, and very deep, almost worrisome."[17]
She began performing in Philadelphia clubs when she was 14. She adopted her stagename, "Pink", around this time. She had had that nickname for quite some time by that point, and initially it had been "a mean thing".[18] Pink has said, "I was extreme. I went through phases from skateboarder, to hip-hopper, to rave child, to lead singer in a band. I did it all, and all at the same time." At 14, she was convinced to audition to become a member of the all-female group Basic Instinct, and earned a spot in the lineup. Ultimately, the group disbanded without releasing any material.[19] At 16, Pink and two other teenage girls, Stephanie Galligan[20] and Chrissy Conway, formed the R&B group Choice. A copy of their first song, "Key to My Heart", was sent to LaFace Records in Atlanta, Georgia, where L.A. Reid overheard it and arranged for the group to fly there so he could see them perform. After that, he signed them to a record deal. Since the three girls were under 18 at the time, their parents had to cosign the contract. The group relocated to Atlanta and recorded an album, which was never released, and "Key to My Heart" appeared on the soundtrack to the 1996 film Kazaam. During a Christmas party, Reid gave Pink an ultimatum: go solo or go home. Choice disbanded in 1998.
After Choice disbanded, Pink began working on her debut solo album under LaFace Records. When working on the album, Pink worked with producers such as Babyface, Kandi Burruss and Tricky Stewart.[21] The album's lead single, "There You Go", was released on February 8, 2000 in the US and May of the same year in the UK.[22] "There You Go" was produced by Kevin "Ske'kspere" Briggs, who had previously worked with female R&B group TLC.[23] The single became a commercial success for Pink, becoming her first Top 10 entry on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it peaked at #7.[24] It was also a success on the Hot Dance Club Play chart, peaking at #8.[25] The single went on to receive a Gold certification from the RIAA, for sales exceeding 500,000 copies.[26] The song was also a success outside of the US. In the United Kingdom, the song peaked at #6,[27] and its highest peak was in Australia, where it reached #2.[27] The single received mixed to positive critical reviews, with one review calling it the highlight of Pink's debut album.[23] Pink's debut album, Can't Take Me Home, was released on April 4, 2000.[28][29][30] The album, considered her only R&B album, was a commercial success. Despite a moderate peak of 26 on the Billboard 200 album chart, the album went on to be certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA, for sales exceeding 2 million copies in the US alone.[31][32][33] The album was certified multi platinum in Australia and Canada as well, where it peaked on the albums chart at #10 and #20, respectively.[34][35][36] The album was also certified Platinum in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at #13.[37] Critical reception to the album was mixed.[38] Allmusic gave the album four out of five stars, stating "thanks to LA Reid and Babyface's production and Pink's engaging talents, it's a promising first effort all the same."[39] Entertainment Weekly gave the album a mixed review, and awarded the album two and half stars, claiming "All in all, Home's just another brick in the R&B wall."[40]
"Most Girls", the second single from Can't Take Me Home, was released on September 18, 2000. The single expanded on Pink's commercial success, and became her highest peaking single in numerous countries at the time of its release. It peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 on the week ending November 14, 2000.[24] It became her first #1 single on any chart, when it peaked at #1 on the Australian singles chart.[41] It also reached #5 in the United Kingdom, one spot higher than her previous single had peaked.[42] For the US release of the song, a dance remix of the single was made and was used by most radio stations.[43] The third and final single, "You Make Me Sick", was released on January 15, 2001. It became her third Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at #33 on the chart.[24] This made it her lowest peaking single at the time of its release. Despite being successful in numerous other countries, it failed to match the success of Pink's first two singles. It peaked at #25 in Australia,[44] and #9 in the United Kingdom.[45] This made it her lowest peaking singles in both of those countries as well.
Pink went on to tour with pop band 'N Sync throughout the Summer of 2000 in North America, as the opening act for their No Strings Attached Tour.[46] She performed in over 20 different shows during the tours run throughout North America, along with Sisqo.[47] The tour was financially successful, grossing over $70 million by the time of its completion. Pink apparently met the band during an awards show in mid-2000, and engaged band member Joey Fatone in a conversation about hair dye.[48] The conversation eventually led to Pink touring with the band.
In 2001, Pink, alongside singers Christina Aguilera and Mýa as well as rapper Lil' Kim, performed a cover of "Lady Marmalade" for the soundtrack of the film Moulin Rouge!. In the US it became the most successful airplay-only single in history, as well as Pink's first #1 single.[49] The success of the single was helped by its music video, which was popular on music channels[50] and won the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year.[51] The song won Pink's first Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals, and provided a boost for the four performers' careers. In a VH1 interview, Pink stated she had to fight with Christina Aguilera's manager to sing the high parts in the song.
Tired of being marketed as another cookie cutter pop act, as well as eager both to be seen as a more serious songwriter and musician and to perform the type of music she wanted to, Pink took her sound in a new direction and sought more artistic or creative control during the recording of her second album, Missundaztood (stylized as M!Ssundaztood).[52] She recruited Linda Perry, former singer of 4 Non Blondes (one of Pink's favorite groups in her teenage years),[53] who said that Pink opened up to her: "In the beginning I just said: 'What do you feel?', and [Pink] would just sit behind the piano and sing." Pink moved into Perry's Los Angeles home where the pair spent several months writing songs for the album.[54] Perry co-wrote and co-produced the album with Dallas Austin and Scott Storch, and according to VH1's Driven program, Antonio "LA" Reid of LaFace Records was not initially content with the new music Pink was making. The album, named Missundaztood because of Pink's belief that people had a wrong image of her,[53] was released in November 2001.
Its lead single, "Get the Party Started" (written and produced by Perry), went top five in the U.S. and many other countries, and #1 in Australia. At the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, the music video won in the categories of Best Female Video and Best Dance Video. The album's other singles—"Don't Let Me Get Me", the Dallas Austin-produced "Just Like a Pill", and "Family Portrait"—were also radio and chart successes, with "Just Like a Pill" becoming Pink's first solo UK number-one hit. The singles were substantial hits on Adult Top 40 radio. "Missundaztood" was certified gold or platinum status in more than 20 countries.[55] It was the second best-selling album in the UK during 2002. "Missundaztood" and "Get the Party Started" earned nominations at the 2003 Grammy Awards for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, respectively. Faith Hill's 2002 album, Cry, features a song co-written by Pink and Perry. In 2002, Pink started a headlining an American, European, and Australian tour, the Party Tour. Additionally, she later became a supporting act for Lenny Kravitz's American tour.
In mid-2003, Pink contributed the song "Feel Good Time" to the soundtrack of the film Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, in which she had a cameo appearance as a motocross race ramp owner/promoter. "Feel Good Time" was co-written by singer Beck, produced by electronic music artist William Orbit, and based on the song "Fresh Garbage" by Spirit. It became Pink's first single to miss the top 40 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, although it was a hit in Europe and in Australia. During the same period, a song Pink co-wrote with Damon Elliott was released on Mýa's album Moodring.
"Feel Good Time" was included on non-U.S. editions of Pink's third album, Try This, which was released on November 11, 2003. Eight of the 13 tracks were co-written with Tim Armstrong of the band Rancid. Linda Perry was featured on the album as a writer and musician. Despite the album reaching the top ten on album charts in the US, in Canada, in the UK, and in Australia, sales were considerably lower than those of Missundaztood. However, it did go platinum in the US. The singles "Trouble" and "God Is a DJ" did not reach the US top 40 but did reach the top ten in other countries, and "Last to Know" was released as a single outside North America. "Trouble" earned Pink her second Grammy Award (for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance) at the 2004 Grammy Awards, and "Feel Good Time" was nominated in the category of Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. She toured extensively on the Try This Tour through Europe and Australia, where the album was better received.
In 2005, Pink collaborated with Lisa Marie Presley on the track "Shine", released on Presley's second album Now What. Pink took a break to write the songs for her fourth album, I'm Not Dead, which she said she titled as such because "It's about being alive and feisty and not sitting down and shutting up even though people would like you to."[56] Pink worked with producers Max Martin, Billy Mann, Christopher Rojas, Butch Walker, Lukasz Gottwald, and Josh Abraham on the album. The album's release through LaFace Records in April 2006 was a substantial success throughout the world, particularly in Australia. The album reached the top ten in the US, the top five in the UK, No. 1 in Germany, and was No. 1 in Australia for two non-consecutive weeks, though it was Pink's lowest seller in the US until the success of the single "U + Ur Hand" in early 2007. The album ranked 96th in the US during 2007.[57]
The album's lead single, "Stupid Girls", was Pink's biggest US hit since 2002 and earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Its music video, in which she parodies celebrities such as Lindsay Lohan, Jessica Simpson, Mary-Kate Olsen, and Paris Hilton,[58] won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video. Subsequent singles "Who Knew" and "U + Ur Hand" were substantial hits in Australia and Europe, and they later became top ten singles in the US. in 2007. The non-US singles were "Nobody Knows", a minor hit in the UK, Australia and Germany; "Dear Mr. President", an open letter to the US President George W. Bush which featured the Indigo Girls and became a No. 1 hit in Belgium as well as a top five hit in Germany, Australia, and other countries; "Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)", a UK top 40 and Australian top five entry; and "'Cuz I Can". The album has sold over 1.3 million copies in the US, as well as over 700,000 copies in Australia. The album proved very popular in Australia, with six top five singles and a record-breaking 62 weeks in the top 10; so far the album has gone 10 times platinum. In June 2008, the I'm Not Dead album returned to the top 50 of the Australian ARIA charts and remained there until November 2009.[59] In June 2009 the album returned once again to the Australian top ten album charts in its 142nd week in the national top fifty.[59] It re-entered at No. 10 on the back of her mammoth Funhouse Tour. As of 2010, the album has spent 162 weeks in the top 50 of the Australian ARIA albums chart.[59]
In support of the album, Pink embarked on the world I'm Not Dead Tour, for which ticket sales in Australia were particularly high; she sold approximately 307,000 tickets in Australia, giving her the record for the biggest concert attendance for an arena tour by a female artist.[60] One of the London shows on the tour was taped and released as a DVD, Pink: Live from Wembley Arena, where she sang Linda Perry's "Whats Up?". In 2006, Pink was chosen to sing the theme song for NBC Sunday Night Football, "Waiting All Day for Sunday Night", which is a take on "I Hate Myself for Lovin' You" by Joan Jett.[61] She contributed a cover of Rufus's "Tell Me Something Good" to the soundtrack of the film Happy Feet, and lent her name to PlayStation to promote the PSP, a special pink edition of which was released.[62]

Pink has named Janis Joplin as her biggest musical influence, saying "She was so inspiring by singing blues music when it wasn't culturally acceptable for white women, and she wore her heart on her sleeve. She was so witty and charming and intelligent, but she also battled an ugly-duckling syndrome. I would love to play her in a movie." Madonna is also one of her biggest influences. Pink has stated "I'd seen artists change styles and fail miserably, but I've also seen artists change and continue to do well. That's why Madonna has always been an inspiration for me." Additionally, Pink said "I wanted to do it my way with my career, and I had this arrogant notion that people weren't just interested in my music but me as a person. That was my bit of arrogance, I guess. That's something I learned from Madonna. I was a fan right from the first time I heard 'Holiday.'"[113] Pink also won her first talent show singing Madonna's "Oh Father".[114] Other influences include Joan Jett, Mary J. Blige, Billy Joel, Linda Perry, and Whitney Houston.[115][116]
Pink has a contralto vocal range.[117] Her voice is regarded as one of the greatest in pop music,[citation needed] and she refuses to use pitch correction in her recordings.[citation needed] Throughout her career, she has received applause from critics for her powerful vocals.[118][119][120][121] Her voice has been described as "raspy", "husky", and "distinctive."[122] James Montgomery of MTV calls her "a deceptively good singer [...] who can out-sing almost anyone".[121] The Guardian describes her voice as "prodigious".[123] Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times labelled her as "a powerhouse vocalist".[124] Pink has also received acclaim for her "raw", "soulful" voice and her ability to emote. The Inquirer defined her voice as "husky" and "gutsy", further complimenting her for developing into a "powerfully emotive vocalist", while comparing her to Janis Joplin.[125] The Star Tribune commends her by writing, "Her slightly raspy, slightly soulful voice made you feel the dysfunction in 'Family Portrait', the longing of 'Who Knew' and the empowerment in 'Perfect'."[126] CNN stated that Pink is known for singing "with the right level of emotion".[127] Fellow pop artist Kelly Clarkson believes that Pink's voice is "the best of our generation".[128]
Pink, aside from her musical feats, has also become known for her style and work outside of music. She has often been seen as "adventurous" with her hair, and has had styles such as fluorescent spikes to pink-streaked dreadlocks to a pitch-black skater cut.[129] Regarding her style, she told InStyle "I'm eclectic. I'm a tomboy, but I'm kind of a hippie and kind of a gangster [...] I don't know if that's a good thing, but it is my thing."[129]
Pink is a prominent campaigner for PETA, contributing her voice toward causes such as the protest against KFC.[130] In conjunction with PETA, she criticized the Australian wool industry over its use of mulesing. In January 2007, she stated that she had been misled by PETA about mulesing and that she had not done enough research before lending her name to the campaign.[131] Her campaigning led to a headlining concert called PAW (Party for Animals Worldwide) in Cardiff, Wales on August 21, 2007.[132]
In June 2012, Pink told Cosmopolitan magazine that her diet is mostly vegan, but she occasionally eats chicken and fish.[134]
Pink is also involved with several charities, including Human Rights Campaign, ONE Campaign, Prince's Trust, New York Restoration Project, Run for the Cure Foundation, Save the Children, Take Back the Night, UNICEF and World Society for the Protection of Animals.[135] As of May 2008, Pink has been officially recognized as an advocate for the RSPCA in Australia. On February 16, 2009, Pink announced she was donating $250,000 to the Red Cross Bushfire Appeal to aid the victims of the bushfires that swept through the Australian state of Victoria earlier that month.[136] Pink stated that she wanted to make "a tangible expression of support".[137] Pink also donated money to Autism Speaks.
In August 2012, Pink became a spokesmodel for CoverGirl, featuring in a fall 2013 advertising campaign themed "beauty with an edge".[138]
Pink has been described as an artist who has changed the scope of pop music. She has been credited for breaking boundaries and pushing the envelope throughout her career. She is often regarded as the "most trailblazing artist" of her generation.[124][139][140] Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times says, "Pink stood up for her music, broke the music industry's mold and scored a breakout hit, challenging a school of teen singers to find their own sounds as well." He adds, "[Pink] also started a race among other teen pop stars like Christina Aguilera to add substance to their own sound."[141] Referring to her as a "powerhouse vocalist", Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times asked, "Why isn't she an even bigger star?"[124] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone commented: "I think people respond to her sense of independence and dedication. It inspires people ... This is a prolific pop artist who is sometimes famous and successful, sometimes obscure, who nonetheless keeps making her own kind of music. Every few years, the spotlight comes back around to her—but her fans can trust that when the spotlight moves along, Pink will keep on writing Pink songs."[124] Powers adds that her mix of rock-style rebellion, emotional rawness, humor, and "infectious" dance beats created "a model for the mashup approach of latter-day divas such as Avril Lavigne, Katy Perry, Kesha, and even Rihanna."[124]
James Montgomery of MTV describes her as "a fabulously fearless pop artist" who can "out-sing almost anyone out there. She can out-crazy Gaga or Lily. She's the total pop-star package, everything you'd want in a singer/entertainer/icon. And still, she remains oddly off the radar. Such is the price of busting borders, I suppose."[140] Entertainment Weekly said: "She essentially invented the whole modern wave of Pop Diva Domination: You can draw a straight line from “Get This Party Started” to Katy Perry, Kesha, pre-messianic Lady Gaga, and post-weird Rihanna."[142] Glamour Magazine wrote: "When Pennsylvania-born Alecia Moore debuted in 2000, pop was dominated by long-locked blonds like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson. Pink changed the game. Without her, the last 13-years of big-voiced, tough chick music is hard to imagine."[143] Jon O'Brien of AllMusic stated that Pink's music provided "the benchmark for the careers of Kelly Clarkson and Katy Perry, to name just two."[144] "Although never quite achieving the cultural impact (and infamy) of contemporaries such as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, she’s proved surprisingly durable and influential (would there be any Katy Perry or Ke$ha without Pink?)", wrote John Murphy of musicOMH in his review of The Truth About Love.[145]
In a 2012 cover story on Pink, The Advocate wrote: "The singer has changed the sound of modern pop music irrevocably [...] paving the path for many of today’s most popular modern female artists, including Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, and Rihanna."[146] Bill Brotherton of the Boston Herald seconded this notion while reviewing The Truth About Love Tour, saying: "It’s hard to imagine that Katy Perry, Rihanna and even Gaga would have achieved superstar status without 33-year-old Alecia Moore leading the way."[147]
Following her performance at the American Music Awards of 2012, LZ Granderson of CNN wrote: "... our culture's biggest sin may well be the auto-tuned syrup we've allowed to dominate the pop charts. All-time chart records are handed to vacuous acts such as the Black Eyed Peas and singing awards are given to vocal lightweights such as Taylor Swift [...] But thank God for Pink. [...] While Christina Aguilera has a tendency to oversing, Britney Spears can't sing, and Lauryn Hill sorta stopped singing, Pink has managed to carve a brilliant 13-year-career by being something that is incredibly rare these days—an artist."[148] British soul singer Adele considers Pink's performance at Brixton Academy in London as one of "the most defining moments" in her life, saying "It was the Missundaztood record, so I was about 13 or 14. I had never heard, being in the room, someone sing like that live. I remember sort of feeling like I was in a wind tunnel, her voice just hitting me. It was incredible."[149][150]
Pink's work has inspired several other artists including Kelly Clarkson,[151] Taylor Swift,[152] Katy Perry,[153] Christina Aguilera,[154] Demi Lovato,[155] Ashley Tisdale,[156] Victoria Justice,[157] and Adele.[158]
On American Idol's 12th season, "Just Give Me a Reason", "Try", and "Fuckin' Perfect" were all covered by three of the top 4 finalists. Also Michelle Chamuel covered Pink four times on the fourth season of the reality television show The Voice.
Pink's internet and social media life has proven strong; she has 20 million followers on Twitter, 27 million likes on her Facebook page, and 4 million subscribers on her official YouTube account.
Pink met professional motocross racer Carey Hart at the 2001 X Games in Philadelphia. Following a brief separation in 2003, Pink proposed to Hart in June 2005 during a Mammoth Lakes motocross race; she was "assisting" in his race and wrote "Will You Marry Me? I’m serious!" on a pit board. He initially didn't notice and continued on for another lap. When he did notice later, he veered off the track to accept right then. She then made him finish the race because she wouldn't marry a loser.[159][160] They married in Costa Rica on January 7, 2006.[161]
After months of speculation, Pink announced in February 2008 that she and Hart had separated.[162][163] Hart subsequently appeared in the video for her 2008 song "So What",[164] which deals with their separation.[165] The couple sought marriage counseling during their separation[166] in hopes of reconciliation.[167] In February 2010, Pink confirmed that she and Hart were back together.[168] Hart appears with Pink in the music video for her songs "Just Give Me a Reason" and "True Love".[169][170]
In November 2010, Pink announced on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that she and Hart were expecting their first child.[171] On June 2, 2011, Pink gave birth to their daughter, Willow Sage Hart.[172]
In 2010, she appeared on Forbes The Celebrity 100 list at #27, with earnings of $44 million.[174] In 2011, she appeared on Forbes The Top-Earning Women in Music list at #6 with earnings of $22 million, with an average of 1 million per show on the road.[175] In 2009, Billboard put her at the 6th place on their Money Makers list, listing her earnings as $36,347,658.[176] In 2013, she appeared on Forbes list of Highest Paid Musicians, with the earnings of $32 million.[177]
A feud between Pink and Kanye West blossomed at the 2009 VMA awards when West jumped onstage and interrupted Taylor Swift while she was accepting her award for Best Female Video. "I'm sorry, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time," West declared during Swift's speech.[178] In a message on Twitter, Pink, who was in the audience, wrote: "Kanye west is the biggest piece of shit on earth. Quote me."[179] She added later: "My heart goes out to Taylor Swift. She is a sweet and talented girl and deserved her moment. She should know we all love her."
It was not until July 2013 that the matter was brought up again. A still unconfirmed recording of West from 2010 stated: "It ain't no love. What the fuck was Pink performing? Don’t nobody know that song. Pink performed twice! Two songs? How the f*ck Pink perform two songs and I didn’t even get asked to perform Heartless. Heartless is the biggest song of the year! It had the most spins of the first quarter! I don’t know that Pink song! But I noticed that she's pink!"[180] Although Swift was said to be deeply upset by the 2009 VMAs humiliation, she commented saying, in a tweet after the nomination announcement, "Two VMA nominations!! If you vote and get us one, I promise to keep a firmer grip on the mic this time ;)".[181]

1979September 08A Not-So-Pink BeginningJim and Judy Moore welcome their second child, Alecia. Though Alecia (who will become known to the world as Pink) enjoys a middle-class upbringing in Doylestown, Pa., outside Philadelphia, family dynamics are tense. By 3, she is already drawn to the rebellious stance of a rock star. "I've never fitted in," she tells The Mail in 2006. "I just wanted to get the hell out of that town and get on with my life."early 90sTroubled TeenAfter her parents' divorce, Pink becomes an angry child. "I was never allowed to go over to any of my friends' houses when I was little, because I was the bad influence," she tells the Sunday Telegraph in 2007. "None of their parents liked me and my own parents were scared to death of me – and for me." By 13, as a regular in the Philly club scene (writing songs, dancing and singing backup), Pink is into drugs, drinking, and heavy partying. At 15, she takes a near-fatal overdose of crystal meth, angel dust, ecstasy, cocaine and marijuana. Arrests for petty theft and trespassing follow.1995Precocious TalentAt 16, Pink gets her first record deal. Antonio "L.A." Reid (right) of LaFace Records, signs her as part of Choice, a female R& B/pop trio. Two years later, without much success in the studio, Choice disbands and Reid encourages Pink to go solo. It is around this time that she dyes her sometimes-green hair pink and chooses the name to match.2000April 04Pop DebutWith her first solo album, Can't Take Me Home, 20-year old Pink sells 3 million records, largely on the strength of three Top Ten singles, "There U Go," "Most Girls" and "You Make Me Sick." Her R&B sound is largely manufactured, and she knows it. "There was no blood, sweat or tears on my first album – and no emotional exchange between me and the musiciains," she tells London's Daily Mail in 2006.  "R& B is a conveyor belt." 2001Grammy AcclaimWith Christina Aguilera, Lil'Kim and Mya (right), Pink contributes vocals to a remake of the song, "Lady Marmalade," for the movie-musical, Moulin Rouge (starring Nicole Kidman). The collaborative single soars to No. 1, and at 22, Pink earns a Grammy award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. "When I won the Grammy I was happy and my parents were proud, but I felt like I was winning it for the team," she tells Playboy. November 20Into Her OwnStriving for a more representational sound, Pink brings in producer Linda Perry for her sophomore album, Missundaztood. Fueled by "Get the Party Started" and "Don't Let Me Get Me," the album sells 10 million copies worldwide and establishes Pink as a pop-rock staple. "Missundaztood gave me a sense of freedom and purpose," she tells Billboard. "It allowed me to exorcise a lot of my demons. The world has become my therapist. And it helped me to feel better about being an outcast, knowing that there's so many other people that share my pain." 2003NovemberA Stumble of SortsPink captures her second Grammy with the lead single "Trouble" from her third album, Try This. The album, harder-edged than Missundaztood, fails to scale the charts, and fans find it lacking. Sales reach only 700,000 in the U.S.  2006January 07I DoAfter four years of on-and-off romance (which includes a brief tryst with Tommy Lee), Pink and motocross racer Carey Hart marry on a Costa Rican beach. She wears a white dress ("to be a girl for a change") at an elegant affair with a rock and roll vibe (their first dance is to a song from Natural Born Killers). "I became traditional and annoying and emotional," the new Mrs. Hart tells PEOPLE. "We always talk about how, when we have kids, what are they going to rebel against? They'll end up playing chess and wearing little uniforms!" April 04Still Kickin'Pink address both personal ("Who Knew") and political ("Dear Mr. President") concerns on her fourth album, I'm Not Dead. The No. 1 single "Stupid Girls," with its enormously popular video, shows her at her pointed best, lampooning the celebrity crazed culture of Paris Hilton, Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears. "It was more of a social commentary on these girls, who think they have to be stick thin and have the latest handbag," she tells  The Mail. "There's nothing wrong with being sexy, but you have to be sexy for yourself, not society." 2008February 18Broken Hart-edPink announces her separation from Hart, saying on her website, "The most important thing for you all to know is that Carey and I love each other so, so much...We are best friends, and we will continue to be." Hart later appears in her video for her breakup hit "So What".

          Alecia "Pink" Moore was born in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, and later raised in Philadelphia. Her parents, James Jim Moore and Judy Judith Moore, divorced when she was very young. As a child, all Pink wanted out of life was to become a singer, and she was driven by the music of Madonna, Mary J. Blige, 4 Non Blondes, Janis Joplin, Billy Joel and Whitney Houston. Pink was a very unique teenager, and went through phases as a skateboarder, hip-hopper and gymnast. She spent several years as part of the club scene in Philadelphia, singing guest spots and performing for talent shows. At the age of 13, she was asked by a local DJ to sing back-up for his rap group, Schools of Thought. A short time later, she was discovered by a record executive and joined a female R&B group, Choice. When that didn't work out, she signed with LaFace Records and began her solo career. In spring 2000, she released her debut, "Can't Take Me Home". She co-wrote many songs and watched it go multi-platinum by the year's end. Her debut included the Top 10 hit, "There You Go", which was certified a gold single.

      She was voted one of Choice USA's "Top 30 Under 30" activists for reproductive freedom in 2004.
      Parodied Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, Mary-Kate Olsen, Jessica Simpson, Hilary Duff, Nicole Richie and several other Hollywood celebrities on the music video for her single "Stupid Girls", in which she deplored the lack of good role models for girls (February 2006).

      Has won two Grammy Awards for "Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals" in 2002 ("Lady Marmalade") and "Best Female Rock Performance" in 2004 ("Trouble").
      As of 2008, she has released four albums including "M!ssundaztood" (2001), which sold 13 million copies worldwide.

      Brought her mother a copy of the lyrics to her song "Family Portrait", which told how she felt about her parents breaking up, before the record was released. Her mother was deeply upset by the lyrics at first, but it led to a heart-to-heart talk between the two, that changed their relationship for the better.

      My dad raised me with some good advice: "Always tell the truth. Always shoot from the hip. You might not have many friends, but you'll never have enemies, because people will always know where you're coming from."
      I decided at 15 that I didn't want to be one of those artists that gets up and sings love songs they don't mean. I decided that I was going to be me to the fullest extent, that my songs were going to reflect relationships I've had, things I've been through, and even the stuff I'm embarrassed about.
      When I was in seventh grade my mom caught me smoking cigarettes and punished me by making me smoke the entire carton. All it did was piss me off because I was out of cigarettes.
      I appreciate being a girl more now than ever. There's a struggle involved in it, but it's so rewarding when you prove to all men that you might have something up on 'em.
      I have to speak for myself. As far as videos go--casting, the artwork, everything--I'm completely hands-on. You have to be if you want your points across.
      I've always loved to prove people wrong. I want to be able to cross color lines, because in music, there really is no barrier.
      It takes a lot of people years to turn a negative into a positive. It takes me, like, an album.
      Just read that I'm bisexual. So 1991. Good thing people write articles about me so I can get my facts straight. Can't wait for the day when people stop talking about sexual preference or that a woman is a CEO and actually start making the world liveable.
=======================================================
                Born Alecia Moore, Pink grew up in a small town just outside Philadelphia and made her singing debut at the age of thirteen, with a local rap group. Music was a huge part of her childhood; her father taught her the guitar and was a major influence on her style. After being spotted performing at a Philadelphia club, she was signed by MCA Records to complete the line-up of vocal group Basic Instinct. After a short spell with the trio, Moore moved on to another R&B outfit; Choice, who were signed by LaFace Records. Her writing contributions came to the attention of L.A. Reid, who signed her as a solo artist, and put her in the studio with the label’s leading writer/producers, including Darryl Simmons and co-founder Babyface. Her debut album, ‘Can't Take Me Home’, was released in April 2000 and hit the US charts with songs ‘There You Go’ and ‘Most Girls’. Pink moved away from her urban roots on the more successful ‘M!ssundaztood’, a harder-edged album featuring several tracks written and produced by her long-time idol, ex-4 Non Blondes leader Linda Perry. The album repeated the commercial success of her debut and featured the US top five singles, ‘Get The Party Started’ and ‘Just Like A Pill’. Her album ‘Try This’ in 2003 also spawned huge hit singles. Pink’s songs are written to compliment and display her vocal range and her love of the pop side of R&B. In April 2006, she released her fourth studio album, ‘I’m Not Dead’ and it went on to reach the top ten of the US charts and the top five in the UK. The prolific singer-songwriter released another chart-topping album in October 2008. ‘Funhouse’ reached number one in the UK and debuted at number two in the US. It also netted the star three Grammy nominations and five Video Music Award nominations. However, she is probably best known for her ‘tough girl’ image, (her dog is named f**ker) and her distinctive style. She is rarely seen without brightly coloured hair and, at only nineteen, she already had thirteen tattoos. She married motocross racer Carey Hart in 2006 after proposing to the sports star during a motocross race where she held up a sign asking if he would be her husband. The couple briefly split in 2008 but made a public announcement in 2009 that they were back together again. The 31-year-old confirmed during the ‘Ellen Degeneres Show’ that she is expecting a baby with Hart. She posted pictures of her pregnant belly on Twitter, stating that she had done so “because paparazzi of today have absolutely no photographic skill or artistry whatsoever, and their pictures are hideous”. The award-winning singer said that a three week photography class had made her “a far better photographer than any one of them”.   To find and purchase Pink's albums click here

Although initially viewed as another face in the late-'90s crowd of teen pop acts, Pink (professionally known as P!nk) quickly transcended and outgrew that label with her combination of pop songcraft and powerhouse, rock-influenced vocals. Born Alecia Moore on September 8, 1979, in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, P!nk received her nickname as a child, years before she dyed her hair accordingly. She grew up in a musical family and was a regular on the Philadelphia club scene by the age of 13, first as a dancer and then as a backing vocalist for the local hip-hop group Schoolz of Thought. At 14, she began writing her own songs; the same year, a local DJ at Club Fever began inviting her on-stage to sing a song every Friday.
P!nk was spotted one night by an executive for MCA Records, who asked her to audition for an R&B group called Basic Instinct. Although P!nk's strong vocals landed her the gig, the group imploded not long after. She was quickly recruited for a female R&B trio called Choice, who signed to L.A. Reid and Babyface's LaFace label on the strength of their demo; however, they too disbanded due to differences over musical direction. During Choice's brief studio time, producer Daryl Simmons asked P!nk to write a bridge section for the song "Just to Be Loving You." Impressed with the results, P!nk rediscovered her songwriting muse, and an equally impressed L.A. Reid soon gave her a solo deal with LaFace.
P!nk recorded her solo debut, Can't Take Me Home, with a variety of songwriting partners and dance-pop and R&B producers. Released in 2000, the album was a double-platinum hit; it spun off three Top Ten singles in "There U Go," "Most Girls," and "You Make Me Sick." She toured that summer as the opening act for *N Sync, but soon found herself tired of being pigeonholed as strictly a teen act despite her sassy, forthright persona. As she set about working on her follow-up album, P!nk took part in the remake of Patti LaBelle's "Lady Marmalade" featured on the Moulin Rouge soundtrack, which also featured powerhouse divas Christina Aguilera, Mya, and Lil' Kim. The song was a massive hit, topping the charts in both the U.S. and U.K. while expanding P!nk's own audience.
Toward the end of the year, P!nk released her next single, "Get the Party Started," which climbed into the Top Five and became the singer's most inescapable hit to date. Her accompanying sophomore album, M!ssundaztood, quickly went double platinum; it boasted a more personal voice and an eclectic sound, plus heavy contributions from ex-4 Non Blondes singer Linda Perry, who helped bring some more rock muscle to P!nk's sound (as did guest appearances by Steven Tyler and Richie Sambora). M!ssundaztood attracted positive critical notices as well, and its second single, "Don't Let Me Get Me," became another fast-rising Top Ten hit. 
P!nk next issued Try This in November 2003. The album continued her progression toward more rock-oriented material, due in part to the songwriting collaboration of Rancid frontman Tim Armstrong on eight of the album's tracks. Try This' lead single, "Trouble," cracked the upper regions of Billboard's Top 40 and earned P!nk a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. On the home front, P!nk wed motocross racer Carey Hart -- whom she had initially met at 2001's X-Games -- on January 7, 2006, in Costa Rica. 
Her next album, I'm Not Dead, appeared that April; its first single, "Stupid Girls," quickly became a hit, while "Who Knew" and "U + Ur Hand" both cracked the Top Ten. I'm Not Dead reached platinum status in several countries and helped ramp up anticipation for P!nk's follow-up, Funhouse, which arrived in October 2008. "So What," the album's leadoff single, became her first number one hit since "Lady Marmalade." Another hit, "Please Don't Leave Me," followed in 2009 and all her hits were collected on the 2010 release Greatest Hits...So Far!!!, which was preceded by the single "Raise Your Glass." Around the time of the release of Greatest Hits...So Far!!!, P!nk announced that she and her husband were expecting their first child.
In September 2012, P!nk released her sixth studio album, The Truth About Love. With production from Greg Kurstin, Butch Walker, Max Martin, Dan Wilson, and others, it became her first number one album in America and earned platinum status in half a dozen countries. The singles "Blow Me (One Last Kiss)," "Try," and "Just Give Me a Reason" all hit the Top Ten in the U.S., and the last became her fourth number one hit in America. P!nk mounted a yearlong tour through Australia, Europe, and North America, and at the end of 2013 she was named Woman of the Year by Billboard. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi

One of the most compelling pop stars of the 2000s, Pink spent her first five albums straddling genres or ignoring them entirely. Though her songs often recall the work of confessional female singer-songwriters, no one has ever accused her of being a folkie; early on, in fact, she presented herself as an R&B diva. Later, collaborations with Aerosmith's Steve Tyler and Rancid's Tim Armstrong — as well as live covers of hits by bands like AC/DC, Queen, and the Divinyls — established what she calls her "rock moves." At the same time, Pink has sounded as any conflicted as any grunge or hip-hop icon about her own stardom; in a couple of her better-known songs, she expressly set herself in opposition to teen idols of her era, even though it's not clear that many fans had lumped her in with them in the first place.
Born Alecia Beth Moore in 1979, to a nurse and a Vietnam veteran in the working class Philadelphia suburb of Doylestown, Pink endured a childhood that her songs have often depicted as tumultuous. But by early adolescence she was dancing and singing for local hip-hop troupes and pop-rock bands, as well as writing her own dark lyrics. 
Before long she was drafted as a member of a couple of major-label-corralled R&B groups that never wound up releasing records. But those connections led to a solo contract with L.A. Reid's LaFace Records, which put out her debut album, Can't Take Me Home (Number 26), in 2000; on the cover, as would become her habit, she spelled her name, "P!nk." Largely an R&B effort in the mode of TLC and Destiny's Child, and full of semi-symphonic breakdowns and complicated rhythms from producers like She'ksphere and Dallas Austin, the record produced three more-or-less soundalike hits, two of which — "There You Go" and "Most Girls" — went Top Ten in the U.S.
In 2001, Pink appeared with Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, and Mya on cover of Labelle's "Lady Marmalade" that was spawned by the film Moulin Rouge. The song topped the pop charts, but Pink began expressing second thoughts about her dance-pop image. And though she had another Top Ten pop hit and took home a pile of MTV Music Video Awards for the upbeat pumper "Get The Party Started," which could easily have fit onto her debut, she had other directions in mind. 
Her second album, late 2001's revealingly named Missundaztood (Number 6), was full of inward-looking laments with uncelebratory titles ("Misery," "Numb," "Dear Diary," "My Vietnam," "Family Portrait"); eight of 14 tracks were written with Linda Perry, from Nineties hippie-revivalists 4 Non Blondes. "L.A. told me/You'll be a pop star," Pink complained in one. "All that you'll have to change/Is everything you are/ Tired of being compared/To damn Britney Spears/She's so pretty/That just ain't me." But despite L.A. Reid's reported initial reluctance, Missundaztood wound up going platinum five times over — more than doubling the success of its seemingly more commercial predecessor.
The even more explicitly rock-oriented Try This (Number 9, 2003), Pink's third album, came out two years later. But it never quite exploded, despite eight songs fully or partially credited to Rancid's Tim Armstrong — which is to say, it sold a mere million copies in the U.S. Its biggest hit — the pop-punkish "Trouble" — peaked at a modest Number 68 in Billboard, but also earned Pink a Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. She also took home a Brit Award for Best International Female Artist in 2003.
Pink's next two albums went platinum as well, and she's managed to stay in the spotlight even when she hasn't had current product on the shelves. Songs she co-wrote have been recorded by artists ranging from Faith Hill to Lisa Marie Presley to Hilary Duff; she's appeared in movies such as Rollerball and Catacombs; and she's made a name as a vocal supporter of PETA's animal-rights causes. 
Though it took a few years to come out, 2006's I'm Not Dead (Number Six) certainly lived up to its title in terms of the visibility of its songs — the Indigo Girls-assisted anti-Dubya protest "Dear Mr. President" only scored on radio overseas, but "Stupid Girls" went Top Twenty in the U.S. right off the bat, helped by a promotional clip that skewered theoretically more frivolous girlies Paris Hilton and Jessica Simpson and won an MTV Best Pop Video Award. I'm Not Dead didn't really take off, though, until the Top Ten early 2007 hit "U + Ur Hand," wherein Pink informed a lousy suitor that he'd be pleasuring himself alone for the night.
In 2008, Pink finally managed a Number One pop single with one of her own songs — the feisty "So What," ostensibly a chronicle of her on-again/off-again relationship with motocrosser Carey Hart, whom she'd married in 2005 and separated from a couple years later. (The couple eventually reconciled.) Pink's fifth album, Funhouse (Number Two, 2008), produced a couple more introspective Top Twenty singles in "Sober" and "Please Don't Leave Me." By then, thanks in part to some highly acrobatic trapeze swinging, she'd established herself as a world-class live draw as well: In terms of gross receipts and attendance, her 2009 tour ranked only behind tours by U2, Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, and AC/DC.
