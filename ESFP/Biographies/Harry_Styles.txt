 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Harry Edward Styles was born on February 1 1994, the son of Anne Cox (née Selley) and Des Styles. At the age of 7 Harry's parents divorced and even though he maintained a good relationship with his father, Harry lived with his mother, and sister, Gemma Styles. Harry auditioned for British show, The X-Factor in 2010 singing "Isn't She Lovely" by Stevie Wonder. He was sent through with all yes's and one no from Louis. He went through multiple rounds, until he was kicked off at Bootcamp. However, Simon Cowell believed that Harry could be brought back, and into a group. Simon then put Liam Payne, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, and Harry Styles into a group. Harry thought of the name "One Direction", and they first performed "Torn" at the Judges' house in Spain. In the end of the X-Factor, One Direction came in 3rd place. Even though the boys were upset, Simon talked to them saying Sony wanted to sign them for a deal the following morning. One Direction then put out their first album "Up All Night" that hit No. 1 in the charts in Australia, United Kingdom, and the United States. With their hit single, "What Makes You Beautiful", the members of One Direction are leaving girls across the world in tears speechless, at their charming looks, and unique personalities. Girls all over are falling head over heals for this British/Irish boy band, and are becoming severely popular.
One Direction were formed at the bootcamp stage of The X Factor (2004) in 2010 when the judges felt Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne, Zayn Malik and Niall Horan were too good to throw away, but not interesting enough to make it as soloists. The decision to put the five boys in the group proved to be popular as they made it to The X Factor final and were the only band to be included on the 2011 X Factor Tour.
      After appearing on The X Factor (2004), he and One Direction band mate Louis Tomlinson moved in together.
      On his father's side, Harry is the grandson of Keith Frederick Styles and Beryl German. On his mother's side, Harry is the grandson of Brian William Selley and Mary Smith.
      I can see how you could get dragged into the bad stuff, but I've got good friends around me, good family. I think I've got my head screwed on.
      A lot of the time, the way it's portrayed is that I only see women in a sexual way. But I grew up with just my mum and sister, so I respect women a lot.
      You get moments all the time that kind of make you pinch yourself, some of them make you quite emotional. Winning a BRIT was a big moment because we were just so excited to be at the awards in the first place. Selling out Madison Square Garden was pretty amazing too. Then we woke to the news that our UK tour was sold out. It was crazy.
      I'm quite old-fashioned. I like going out to dinner. You have the chance to talk to somebody and get to know them better.
      I don't want to be viewed as a womanizer or whatever. I don't like going crazy crazy, I like having fun but it's nice to wake up in your own bed, isn't it?

Harry Edward Styles[1] (born 1 February 1994)[2][3] is an English pop singer and actor, known as a member of the boy band One Direction. He made his debut as a singer with his band White Eskimo, who performed locally in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, England. In 2010, Styles auditioned as a solo artist for the British television series The X Factor. After being eliminated as a solo performer, Styles was brought back into the competition, along with four other contestants, to form the group that would later become known as One Direction.
A native of Holmes Chapel, Styles attended Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School, and also worked part-time at a local bakery. He became interested in singing at a young age, performing at various talent shows, singing competitions and weddings. In addition to singing, Styles has also appeared in television and film, including the Nickelodeon series iCarly and the autobiographical concert film One Direction: This Is Us.
Since joining One Direction, Styles, along with bandmates Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson, have released three commercially successful albums, performed on a worldwide tour, and won several awards, including two BRIT Awards and four MTV Video Music Awards. Their debut single "What Makes You Beautiful" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, and has since sold over 5 million copies worldwide, making it among one the best-selling singles of all time.
Styles was born in Redditch, Worcestershire.[4][5][6] He is the son of Anne Cox (née Selley) and Desmond "Des" Styles.[7][8][9][10] Many of his ancestors were farm labourers in Norfolk.[11] Styles was raised in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, after his parents moved there along with his older sister, Gemma,[12] when he was a baby.[1] He attended Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School.[13] Styles' parents divorced when he was seven and his mother later remarried.[14] As a sixteen-year-old he worked part-time at the W. Mandeville Bakery in Holmes Chapel.[15]
As a child, Styles loved singing, noting Elvis Presley and The Beatles as his influences.[16] While at Holmes Chapel Comprehensive, Styles was the lead singer for the band White Eskimo,[17] which won a local Battle of the Bands competition.[18][dead link]
In 2010, Styles auditioned as a solo candidate for the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor.[19] He failed to progress to the "Boys" category at "judges' houses." Four others in his age group did as well, but after a suggestion by Nicole Scherzinger, a guest judge,[19] they were put together to form a five-piece boy band at Wembley Arena, in London, England, in July 2010, during the "bootcamp" stage of the competition,[20] thus qualifying for the "Groups" category. Subsequently, the group got together for two weeks to get to know each other and to practice.[21][22] Styles came up with the name One Direction.[21] For their qualifying song at "judges' houses", and their first song as a group, One Direction sang an acoustic version of "Torn".[23] Simon Cowell later commented that the performance convinced him that the group "were confident, fun, like a gang of friends, and kind of fearless as well."[24] Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were Cowell's last act in the competition.[25] The group quickly gained popularity in the UK.[24]
One Direction finished in third place and immediately after the final, their song "Forever Young", which would have been released if they had won The X Factor, was leaked onto the internet.[26] Shortly afterwards it was confirmed that One Direction had been signed by Cowell to a reported £2 million Syco Records record contract.[27][28] Recording for their debut album began in January 2011, as they flew to Los Angeles to work with RedOne, a record producer.[29] A book licensed by One Direction, One Direction: Forever Young (Our Official X Factor Story), was published by HarperCollins in February 2011,[30] subsequently topping The Sunday Times Best Seller list.[31] The same month, the boy band and other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour.[32] During the tour the group performed for 500,000 people throughout the UK.[33] After the tour concluded in April 2011, the group continued working on their debut album.[29] Recording took place in Stockholm, London and Los Angeles, as One Direction worked with producers Carl Falk, Savan Kotecha, Steve Mac, and Rami Yacoub, among others.[34][35] Styles came up with band name One Direction, which he thought would sound good when The X Factor announcer Peter Dickson read their name out on the live shows.[36]
Following The X Factor, One Direction were signed to Simon Cowell's Syco Entertainment in 2010.[37] One Direction released their first studio album, Up All Night, in 2011, followed by their second, Take Me Home, in 2012.[38] One Direction: This Is Us, a documentary about the band directed by Morgan Spurlock, was released in August 2013.[39] The film grossed more than $30 million worldwide its first weekend in theaters.[40] The band's third studio album, Midnight Memories, was released on 25 November 2013.[41]

Harry Styles, baby-faced (despite being 19-years-old) and blessed with the kind of curls young girls go crazy over. He's the youngest member of The X Factor finalists One Direction. And in fact, it was Harry himself who came up with the band name.
Before Harry Styles' high-profile girlfriends and racking up his millions of followers on Twitter, he was born in Cheshire. While studying at Homes Chapel comprehensive school, Harry tried auditioning for the seventh series of The X Factor in 2010. He was unsuccessful as a solo auditionee, but at the recommendation of guest judge Nicole ‘Don’tcha wish your girlfriend was hot like me’ Scherzinger, was teamed up with several other contestants to form One Direction and enter the group category of the show.
His fellow bandmates are Liam Payne from Wolverhampton, Niall Horan from Mullingar in Ireland, Zayn Malik from Bradford and Louis Tomlinson from Doncaster. They are all in their teens, they are all incredibly cute, and their faces are currently plastered all over the walls of teen and tweens up and down the country.
One Direction finished third in The X Factor 2010 and have gone on to sign a whopping £2 million deal with Simon Cowell’s label Syco, release a whole bunch of Number One singles in the UK, including What Makes You Beautiful and Gotta Be You, both taken from their Number One Album, Up All Night.
Harry and the boys recently travelled to the US of A and Australia, and made quite an impression on the locals; getting themselves a Billboard Number One with What Makes You Beautiful.
Harry hit the headlines when it was revealed he was seeing The Xtra Factor's host Caroline Flack, a whopping 16 years his senior. After a number of death threats and mickey takes, Caroline called it a day and the pair are now 'just friends'.
Since then Harry's had a rather turbulent relationship with Taylor Swift. But then again, who hasn't had a turbulent relationship with Taylor Swift?
Harry Styles didn’t just partake in a wet t-shirt competition, he partook in one that SHOWED OFF HIS NEW INK! HIS HOT BODY! HIS BEST BITS! (And also one that was, in fact, not a competition at all but part of One Direction’s latest video Live While We’re Young - though these are minor details…) 
Have you even wondered, have you ever sat down and thought: "what would happen if the wind blew Harry Styles' hair all crazy?" We know the answer to the question. The answer to that question is 'yes'. And that's because, up until know, Harry Styles' hair has been like Michael Jackson's face during the '80s, or 'Yahweh', the true name ...
It is a question that has kept us all up at night: “What,” you think, tossing and turning, “what would One Direction’s...

Harry Edward Styles[1] (Born on February 1, 1994) is a member of One Direction along with Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan, and Zayn Malik. He is the youngest member of the group.
   Harry when he was younger.  Harry Styles was born in Redditch, Worcestershire, England to Des Styles and Anne Cox. He has an older sister, Gemma. When Harry was seven years old, his parents divorced. His mother remarried in early June 2013 to Robin Twist. [2] As a child Harry loved singing. He's listed Elvis Presley as one of his influences.
Growing up Harry lived in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, England and attended Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School, a state comprehensive school.
 Harry was the lead singer for the band White Eskimo with band members Hayd Morris (lead guitarist), Nick Clough (bass guitarist), and Will Sweeny (drummer).[3] They came together to compete in a Battle of the Bands. The band won the competition, and it helped Harry realize that he loved performing in front of people.
In 2010, when he was sixteen years old, Harry auditioned for the seventh season of The X Factor. He wanted a professional opinion on his singing because up until then his mom was the one telling him he was a good singer. Before his audition he said, "Singing's what I want to do, and if people who can make that happen for me don't think that I should be doing that, then it's a major setback in my plans."
Harry sang "Isn't She Lovely" and received positive comments from Simon Cowell and Nicole Scherzinger, while Louis Walsh had doubts on whether he was ready to progress in the competition. At bootcamp, Harry sang "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" before being rejected and put into One Direction.
Following The X Factor, One Direction signed a record contract with Sony Music subsidiary Syco Music. They released their studio album, Up All Night. One Direction have come far, hit the top of the charts, have their own tour, and released Take Me Home as well.
Harry is very close to his mother, Anne, and his sister, Gemma. He even got tattoos dedicated to them and often shows his love for them.
Harry briefly dated Caroline Flack in 2011 when he was 17 and she was 32. Their relationship caused widespread controversy because of their fifteen year age gap. They met in 2010 while Harry was a contestant on The X Factor, and Caroline was the co-host of the companion show, The Xtra Factor. Harry would often flirt with Caroline during interviews, and admitted to being attracted to her. Romance rumors grew after October 16, 2011, when it was reported that Harry and Caroline were seen kissing at an X Factor after party. Both denied there was a relationship. Rumors went unproven until December 2011 when he was seen leaving her London home early in the morning after having spent the night.
Throughout the relationship, Caroline received death threats from many One Direction fans as well as intense media scrutiny during the relationship. Although at the time neither confirmed they were together, on January 26, 2012, through Twitter Harry revealed the relationship had mutually ended.[4] She and Harry still remain friends.

38. Harry want to lose his trademark curly locks but no-one will let him! He said: “I want to shave my hair off, and no one will really let me. Everyone’s telling me not to do it. And my argument is, like, I think my popularity is in my face, and not my hair.”
41. Harry celebrated reaching number one in America with ‘Up All Night’ by buying a… MATTRESS!! He explained to The Sun: "I'm going to treat myself to a new one. I need a good one. The one I'm using is still the one that was there when I moved in. The springs have gone." Rock and Roll!! 
44. Harry counts pop megastar Rihanna as one of his biggest fans. RiRi told The Mirror: "Harry, yeah. I watch their videos and I remember thinking, 'Wow, he's a star'. He seems very sure. It seems, like, it's so natural to him."

53. Such is the bromance between Harry and Louis, many fans fuse their names together to create Larry Stylinson! 
55. Cheryl Cole claims she has seen Harry in his underwear. She told Sugarscape: "Harry? I've seen Harry in his boxer shorts. Harry's a little brother type, but I get it; the girls go crazy for him - and the women."
57. Harry is a mummy’s boy! His mum Anne Cox told heat magazine: “Sometimes, he phones up to five times a day. When there’s a time difference, he tends to text saying, ‘I love you, Mum,’ or ‘I miss you’. He’s still my little boy.” Bless! 
60. When ‘Up All Night’ reached number one in America back in March, Harry described the moment as a “dream come true.” He said: "We simply cannot believe that we are No.1 in America! It's beyond a dream come true for us. We want to thank each and every one of our fans in the US who bought our album and we would also like to thank the American public for being so supportive of us."
61. Earlier this year Harry was forced to take action following a series of back problems. He told The Sun: "I have bad posture and I've been told to take Pilates once a week."
63. Harry has got a star tattoo on the inside of his left arm. Each point apparently represents a member of One Direction. 
65. Unsurprisingly, Harry loves his job. He says: “You can’t wish for things like this (being a pop star). You can’t sit and imagine that you actually get to do this job. If I had to call it a job, then this is my job, and I love my job.”

72. Harry openly admits he’s a bit clumsy. In fact, he’s dropped his shades down the bog not once, but twice! He tweeted: “Dropping your sunglasses down the toilet is a mistake you would think that you'd learn from. Apparently not.”

78. Harry’s favourite X Factor moment was singing on the charity single ‘Heroes’ (a cover of the David Bowie classic). The track reached number one in the UK and Ireland and raised tens of thousands of pounds for military charity Help The Heroes. 
80. In May 2012 Harry sold a signed charity wristband for a whopping £9010 on eBay. Once worn by Harry, the wristband was part of a Believe In Magic sale – a charity that spreads Magic to seriously and terminally ill children with experiences to make their lives happier.
84. If he wasn’t in One Direction, Harry reckons he’d be training to be a physiotherapist. Asked what he’d be up to without his lucky break Harry said: “I always wanted to be a physiotherapist and before I was in the band, I was studying, so I’d probably be working hard and studying for that.”
86. Harry has a crush on Adele. Back in February at the BRIT Awards he said she’s the one star he’d most like to snog there. He added: “I’d date Adele! She makes me go weak at the knees.” 
88. One of Harry’s favourite phrases is “Keep the change you filthy animal.” The line is from a fictional gangster movie called ‘Angels with Filthy Souls’ that Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) watches in the 1990 film Home Alone. 
89. Harry’s profile on Twitter reads: “Hello :D I'm 1/5 of One Direction..And if you follow, thank you..I Love You .xx”

91. One Direction were so exhausted from constantly touring that in March this year they all had vitamin injections to boost their energy levels. Harry had his in his bum! 
93. Harry is big fan of supercars. Back in April he splashed out on an Audi R8 Coupe and while on tour in Los Angeles in June he drove a £195,000 Ferrari. He also drives a Range Rover that cost him £15,000 to insure. Ouch! 
94. Harry has got FOUR NIPPLES. In addition to the normal pair he has two tiny ones further down his chest. 
95. Harry has joked that if all the 1D members liked the same girl they would fight for her. He told Top of the Pops Magazine: “I don't think we have liked the same girl yet as we all have quite different taste in girls, so we don't come across that problem, which is great. But if that were to happen? Fisticuffs!”
98. In early 2012, Harry played an ace prank his bandmate Zayn Malik. When Zayn was asleep, Harry shaved his initials ‘H.S.’ on his leg! Zayn told Twist magazine it “wasn’t too attractive.” 
99. Harry’s hair hasn’t always been curly – it was straight from when he was born until the end of primary school. 
100. Harry’s dad Des said the 15-year age gap between him and Caroline Flack was “ridiculous.” He said: "32 or whatever she was and Harry 17, that's a bit extreme."
101. Harry suffers badly from hay fever. In July 2011 he sarcastically wrote on Twitter: “I Love Hayfever… It’s My Favourite Thing.”
