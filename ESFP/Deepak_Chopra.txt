Karen Johnson is a co-founder of the Diamond Approach as it is taught in the Ridhwan School, a contemporary original spiritual understanding and path, expressing timeless wisdom on self-realization using the insights of our time. She is a colleague and friend of Hameed Ali (A.H. Almaas). Her life is dedicated to the discovery of inner freedom and sharing the treasures with humankind.
In this interview, we discussed how the Diamond Approach is evolving, what differentiates it from other traditions, and the most recent developments of the past 15 years, about which Karen and Hameed have only recently begun to teach, speak and write.
Neither the depths of spirit nor the surface of the mundane world can adequately express what reality is and what is possible for each of us. How can our human lives be both the arena for spiritual practice and enlightenment, and the occasion for our true being to express its infinite possibilities?
When we realize that we are each the miracle of matter and spirit and at the same time we are neither, our everyday ordinary experiences can become doorways to further possibilities of reality, of awakening to our spiritual potential in its endless possibilities. True Being lives through the particulars of our lives, utilizing them to reveal its potentialities. The Diamond Approach explores how to use our personal situations as occasions for practice and learning, and as opportunities for expression of our finer spiritual qualities. It enables people to work with their everyday experiences of work, relationships, play, creativity, love, sex and so on to learn to be the transcendent living a human life. Its students learn to employ each particular situation within this world to go beyond it in a way that includes it. Inclusive transcendence enables our human consciousness to view reality beyond the concepts of duality and nonduality. Each particular situation affords us the opportunity to use its energies and forces to liberate and optimize our experience. Following such path, it becomes natural to be of help to others and to life in general.

The iconography and texts of most spiritual traditions depict and describe a realm of physical existence more subtle than ordinary sensory perception reveals. The most commonly portrayed phenomena are halos in paintings of saints. But in addition to this evidence of the human “subtle body”, the traditions are abundant with paintings and stories of subtle beings such angels, gods, devas, demons, etc.
Is this mere mythology or does it suggest that subtle perception is part of spiritual development? So far, the non-dual community has not discussed this at all. The New Age community has, but often in a fanciful way that the non-dual community has, perhaps wisely, chosen to eschew. Yet many who have had abiding awakenings that non-dual traditions predict and respect discover, in time, that subtle perception begins to dawn. They begin to perceive auras, angels, devas, and the like as routinely as most of us see other human beings.
All, with the exception of Ruffina, have been interviewed on BatGap. (She’ll be interviewed in August.) See alphabetical menu on right to find their interviews.
whether it is an inevitable development on the path, or a special aptitude like musical or athletic ability,
the nature of our relationship with the beings which reside on subtler levels of creation. Do we and they support each other in some way?
whether subtle perception should be intentionally cultivated or whether it will develop on its own if and when it is meant to. If it can be developed, what are the prerequisites to and stages of its development?

Jeddah Mali is the Executive Director and founder of Global Paradigm Ltd, which delivers training programs for individuals and organizations seeking a completely new approach to the age-old dilemma of how to make life, business and society work effectively and harmoniously. Jeddah’s unique approach identifies and maps the cohesive design underlying every system, from an individual person to a solar system. It reveals the hidden patterns within every aspect of life that are responsible for how things turn out. Jeddah provides an in-depth examination into the nature and function of this design, and the mechanics that make it work. Our understanding and use of these mechanics determine the extent to which we can produce consistent and reliable results. Jeddah is sought after for her precise understanding of human beings, the contribution each person makes individually and collectively and the impact this has on the world in which we live. Her work examines the link between our design as human beings and our hardwired predisposition towards peace, collaboration and contentment.

Deepak Chopra (/ˈdiːpɑːk ˈtʃoʊprə/) (born October 22, 1947) is an Indian-American author, public speaker, and licensed physician who is a prominent alternative-medicine advocate and has been described as a New-Age guru.[2] The author of several dozen books and videos, he has become one of the best-known and wealthiest figures in the holistic-health movement.[3]
Chopra obtained his medical degree in India before emigrating in 1970 to the United States, where he specialized in endocrinology and became Chief of Staff at the New England Memorial Hospital (NEMH). In the 1980s he began practicing transcendental meditation (TM) and in 1985 resigned his position at NEHM to establish the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Center. Chopra left the TM movement in 1994 and founded the Chopra Center for Wellbeing, now located in Carlsbad, California.[4]
Combining principles from Ayurveda (Hindu traditional medicine) and mainstream medicine, Chopra's approach to health incorporates ideas about the mind-body relationship, teleology in nature and the primacy of consciousness over matter – that "consciousness creates reality."[5] He claims that his practices can extend the human lifespan and treat chronic disease, a position criticized by scientists, who say his treatments rely on the placebo effect, that he misuses terms and ideas from quantum physics (quantum mysticism), and that he provides people with false hope that may obscure the possibility of effective medical treatment.[6]
Chopra was born in New Delhi, India, to Krishan Lal Chopra (1919–2001) and Pushpa Chopra; his mother tongue is Punjabi (his first name, Deepak, means light).[7]
His paternal grandfather was a sergeant in the British Army. His father was a prominent cardiologist, head of the department of medicine and cardiology at New Delhi's Mool Chand Khairati Ram Hospital for over 25 years; he was also a lieutenant in the British army, serving as an army doctor at the front at Burma and acting as a medical adviser to Lord Mountbatten, viceroy of India.[8] As of 2014 Chopra's younger brother, Sanjiv, is a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and on staff at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.[9]
Chopra completed his primary education at St. Columba's School in New Delhi and graduated from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in 1969.[4] He spent his first months as a doctor working in rural India, including, he writes, six months in a village where the lights went out whenever it rained.[10] It was during his early career that he was drawn to study endocrinology, particularly neuroendocrinology, to find a biological basis for the influence of thoughts and emotions.[11]
He married in India in 1970 before emigrating with his wife that year to the United States; the couple have two children and three grandchildren as of 2014.[12] The Indian government had banned its doctors from sitting the American Medical Association exam needed to practice in America, so Chopra had to travel to Sri Lanka to sit it; after passing he arrived, penniless, in the United States to take up a clinical internship at Muhlenberg Hospital in Plainfield, New Jersey, where doctors from overseas were being recruited to replace those serving in Vietnam.[13]
Between 1971 and 1977 he completed residencies in internal medicine at the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Massachusetts, the VA Medical Center, St Elizabeth's Medical Center and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.[14] He earned his license to practice medicine in the state of Massachusetts in 1973, becoming board-certified in internal medicine, specializing in endocrinology.[15]
Chopra taught at the medical schools of Tufts University, Boston University and Harvard University, and became Chief of Staff at the New England Memorial Hospital (later known as the Boston Regional Medical Center) in Stoneham, Massachusetts, before establishing a private practice in Boston in endocrinology.[4]
While visiting New Delhi in 1981, he met the physician Brihaspati Dev Triguna, head of the Indian Council for Ayurvedic Medicine, whose advice prompted him to begin investigating Ayurvedic practices.[16] Chopra was "drinking black coffee by the hour and smoking at least a pack of cigarettes a day."[17] He took up transcendental meditation to help him stop; as of 2006 he continued to meditate for two hours every morning and half an hour in the evening.[18]
Chopra's involvement with TM led to a meeting, in 1984, with the leader of the TM movement, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who asked him to establish an Ayurvedic health center.[19] He left his position at the NEMH. Chopra said that one of the reasons he left was his disenchantment at having to prescribe too many drugs: "[W]hen all you do is prescribe medication, you start to feel like a legalized drug pusher. That doesn't mean that all prescriptions are useless, but it is true that 80 percent of all drugs prescribed today are of optional or marginal benefit."[20]
He became the founding president of the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine, one of the founders of Maharishi Ayur-Veda Products International, and medical director of the Maharishi Ayur-veda Health Center in Lancaster, Massachusetts. The center charged between $2,850 and $3,950 a week, offering Ayurvedic cleansing rituals such as massage, enemas and oil baths, with an extra charge of $1,000 for lessons in transcendental meditation. Celebrity patients included Elizabeth Taylor.[21] Chopra also became one of the TM movement's spokespersons. In 1989 the Maharishi awarded him the title "Dhanvantari of Heaven and Earth" (Dhanvantari is the Hindu physician to the gods).[22] That year Chopra's Quantum Healing: Exploring the Frontiers of Mind/Body Medicine was published, followed by Perfect Health: The Complete Mind/Body Guide (1990).[23]
In May 1991 the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published an article by Chopra and two others on Ayurvedic medicine and TM.[24] JAMA subsequently published an erratum stating that the lead author, Hari M. Sharma, had undisclosed financial interests, followed by a six-page article by JAMA associate editor Andrew A. Skolnick.[25] According to Science, several experts on meditation and traditional Indian medicine criticized JAMA for accepting the "shoddy science" of the original article.[26] Chopra and two TM groups sued Skolnick and JAMA for defamation, asking for $194 million in damages, but the case was dismissed in March 1993.[27]
By 1992 Chopra was serving on the National Institute of Health's ad hoc panel on alternative medicine.[28] In June 1993 he moved to California as executive director of Sharp HealthCare's Institute for Human Potential and Mind/Body Medicine, and head of their Center for Mind/Body Medicine, a clinic in an exclusive resort in Del Mar that charged $4,000 a week and included Michael Jackson's family among its clients.[29] Chopra and Jackson first met in 1988 and remained friends for 20 years; when Jackson died in 2009 after being administered prescription drugs, Chopra said he hoped it would be a call to action against the "cult of drug-pushing doctors, with their co-dependent relationships with addicted celebrities."[30]
Chopra left the Transcendental Meditation movement around the time he moved to California.[31] By his own account, the Maharishi had accused him of competing for the position of guru,[32] although Chopra rejects identification as a "guru".[33] Cynthia Ann Humes writes that the Maharishi was concerned, and not only with regard to Chopra, that rival systems were being taught at lower prices.[34] Chopra, for his part, was worried that his close association with the TM movement might prevent Ayurvedic medicine from being accepted as legitimate, particularly after the problems with the JAMA article.[35]
Chopra's Ageless Body, Timeless Mind: The Quantum Alternative to Growing Old was published in 1993. (Robert Sapolsky sued because the book used a chart of his without proper attribution; the issue was settled out of court.)[36] The book and his friendship with Michael Jackson gained him an interview on July 12 that year on Oprah, which made him a household name. Paul Offit writes that within 24 hours Chopra had sold 137,000 copies of his book and 400,000 by the end of the week.[37] Four days after the interview, the Maharishi National Council of the Age of Enlightenment wrote to TM centers in the United States, instructing them not to promote Chopra, and his name and books were removed from the movement's literature and health centers.[38] Neuroscientist Tony Nader became the movement's new "Dhanvantari of Heaven and Earth."[39]
Sharp HealthCare changed ownership in 1996 and Chopra left to set up the Chopra Center for Wellbeing with neurologist David Simon, now located at the Omni La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad, California.[40] In 2004 he received his California medical licence, and as of 2014 is affiliated with Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla.[41] Chopra is the owner and supervisor of the Mind-Body Medical Group within the Chopra center, which in addition to standard medical treatment offers personalized advice about nutrition, sleep-wake cycles and stress management, based on mainstream medicine and Ayurveda.[42] He is a fellow of the American College of Physicians and member of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists.[43]
As of 2014 Chopra serves as an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.[44] He participates annually as a lecturer at the Update in Internal Medicine event sponsored by Harvard Medical School and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.[45] Robert Carroll writes of Chopra charging $25,000 per lecture, "giving spiritual advice while warning against the ill effects of materialism."[46]
In 2005 Chopra was appointed as a senior scientist at Gallup, analysing the results of health and well-being surveys.[47] In 2009 he founded the Chopra Foundation, a tax-exempt 501(c) organization, to promote and research holistic medicine; the Foundation sponsors annual Sages and Scientists conferences.[48] He sits on the board of advisors of the National Ayurvedic Medical Association and the tech startup State.com.[49] Since 2005 he has been a board member of Men's Wearhouse, a men's clothing distributor, and in 2006 launched Virgin Comics with his son, Gotham Chopra, and entrepreneur Richard Branson.[50]
In 1999 Time magazine included Chopra in its list of the 20th century's heroes and icons. The following year Mikhail Gorbachev referred to him as "one of the most lucid and inspired philosophers of our time." Journalist Cosmo Landesman wrote in 2005 that Chopra was "hardly a man now, more a lucrative new age brand – the David Beckham of personal/spiritual growth."[51]
Scientists have criticized Chopra's mix of spirituality and science. According to Ptolemy Tompkins, the medical and scientific communities' opinion of him ranges from dismissive to damning; criticism includes claims that his approach could lure sick people away from effective treatments.[52] Science writer Michael Shermer has said that Chopra is "the very definition of what we mean by pseudoscience".[53]
English professor George O'Har places Chopra's "sophistries" alongside the emotivism of Oprah Winfrey.[54] Pediatrician Paul Kurtz writes that Chopra's "regnant spirituality" is reinforced by postmodern criticism of the notion of objectivity in science, while civil liberties activist Wendy Kaminer equates Chopra's views with irrational belief systems such as New Thought, Christian Science and Scientology.[55]
Sociologist Hans Baer argues that Chopra has not explored the potential benefits of a truly holistic approach to health, ignoring factors such as air and water pollution, racism and inequality, and failing to encourage people to become part of reform movements. Instead he offers an alternative form of medical hegemony, focusing on the individual, often wealthy, worried well.[56]

In 2013 he argued that militant skeptics were editing Wikipedia to prevent what he believes would be a fair representation of the views of such figures as Rupert Sheldrake. The result, he wrote, was that the encyclopedia's readers were denied the opportunity to read of attempts to "expand science beyond its conventional boundaries".[57] Biologist Jerry Coyne responded claiming that at Wikipedia, Chopra's "own lucrative brand of woo is finally exposed as a lot of scientifically-sounding psychobabble".[58]
According to Srinivas Aravamudan, in 2005 he was able to charge $25,000–30,000 per lecture five or six times a month.[59] Paul Offit stated, writing in 2013, that Chopra's business grossed around $20 million annually, built on the sale of courses, books, videos, herbal supplements and massage oils; a year's worth of anti-aging products can cost up to $10,000.[60] As of 2013 Chopra had written 75 books, 21 of them New York Times bestsellers, which have been translated into 35 languages.[61] Chopra is estimated to be worth over $80 million as of 2014.[62]
Chopra believes that "ageing is simply learned behaviour" that can be slowed or prevented.[63] Actress Demi Moore said she believed she might attain the age of 130 by following Chopra's teachings,[63] and Chopra himself has said he expects "to live way beyond 100".[64] Conversely, Chopra also says that aging can be accelerated, for example by a person engaging in "cynical mistrust".[65]
Robert Todd Carroll has characterized Chopra's promotion of lengthened life as selling "hope" that seems to be "a false hope based on an unscientific imagination steeped in mysticism and cheerily dispensed gibberish".[66]
Chopra speaks and writes regularly about metaphysics, the study of consciousness and Vedanta philosophy. He is a philosophical idealist, arguing for the primacy of consciousness over matter and for purpose and intelligence in nature – that mind, or "dynamically active consciousness," is a fundamental feature of the universe.[67]
In this view, consciousness is both subject and object.[68] It is consciousness, he writes, that creates reality; we are not "physical machines that have somehow learned to think ... [but] thoughts that have learned to create a physical machine."[69] He argues that the evolution of species is the evolution of consciousness seeking to express itself as multiple observers; the universe experiences itself through our brains: "We are the eyes of the universe looking at itself."[70] He opposes reductionist thinking in science and medicine, arguing that we can trace the physical structure of the body down to the molecular level and still have no explanation for beliefs, desires, memory and creativity.[71]
Chopra argues that everything that happens in the mind and brain is physically represented elsewhere in the body, with mental states (thoughts, feelings, perceptions and memories) directly influencing physiology by means of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, oxytocin and serotonin. He has stated, "Your mind, your body and your consciousness – which is your spirit – and your social interactions, your personal relationships, your environment, how you deal with the environment, and your biology are all inextricably woven into a single process ... By influencing one, you influence everything."[72]
Chopra and physicians at the Chopra Center practise integrative medicine, combining the medical model of conventional Western medicine with alternative therapies such as Ayurveda.[citation needed] According to Ayurveda, illness is caused by an imbalance in the patient's doshas or humours, and is treated with diet, exercise and meditative practices[73] - there is, however, no scientific evidence to show that Ayurveda is effective in treating any disease.[74]
In discussing healthcare Chopra has used the term "quantum healing," which he defined in Quantum Healing (1989) as the "ability of one mode of consciousness (the mind) to spontaneously correct the mistakes in another mode of consciousness (the body)."[75] This attempted to wed the Maharishi's version of Ayur-vedic medicine with concepts from physics, an example of what cultural historian Kenneth Zysk called "New Age Ayurveda."[76] The book introduced Chopra's view that a person's thoughts and feelings give rise to all cellular processes.[77]
Physicists have objected to Chopra's use of terms from quantum physics; he was awarded the satirical Ig Nobel Prize in physics in 1998 for "his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life, liberty, and the pursuit of economic happiness."[78] When Chopra and Jean Houston debated Sam Harris and Michael Shermer in 2010 on the question "Does God Have a Future?", Harris argued that Chopra's use of "spooky physics" merged two language games in a "completely unprincipled way."[79] Interviewed in 2007 by Richard Dawkins, Chopra said that he used the term quantum as a metaphor when discussing healing and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics.[80]
Chopra wrote in 2000 that his AIDS patients were combining mainstream medicine with activities based on Ayurveda, including taking herbs, meditation and yoga.[81] He acknowledges that AIDS is caused by the HIV virus, but claims that, "'[h]earing' the virus in its vicinity, the DNA mistakes it for a friendly or compatible sound". Ayurveda uses vibrations which are claimed to correct this supposed sound distortion.[82] Medical professor Lawrence Schneiderman writes that Chopra's treatment has "to put it mildly ... no supporting empirical data."[83]
In August 2001 ABC News aired a show segment on distance healing and prayer, in which Chopra attempted to relax a reporter in another room; the reporter's vital signs were recorded in charts said to show a correspondence between Chopra's periods of concentration and the subject's periods of relaxation. Health and science journalist Christopher Wanjek, calling it "an instructive example of how bad medicine is presented as exciting news," argued that more detailed examination of the charts showed the correlations were not as close as claimed.[84] After the show, a poll of its viewers found that 90 per cent believed in distance healing.[85]

The main criticism revolves around the fact that macroscopic objects are too large to exhibit inherently quantum properties like interference and wave function collapse.

Deepak Chopra is one of the leading mind-body spirit Gurus. He seeks to teach the benefits of incorporating meditation and a healthy lifestyle for increasing inner happiness.
Deepak Chopra was born in New Delhi, India in 1947. He attended the All India Institute of Medical sciences studying western medicine. In 1968 he came to America and began working in a New Jersey hospital. This led to a successful career in medicine in which he became chief of staff at the New England Memorial Hospital. He also established a growing private medical practise. During this time Deepak Chopra says that he used to smoke a packet of cigarettes a day and also he used to drink heavily to calm his nerves. Increasingly he became uneasy at his approach to life and also he became aware of the limitations of Western medicine. He felt there was something missing in his approach to medical care. Therefore he increasingly became interested in Ayurvedic medicine, which stresses a more holistic approach to medical care. 
After studying the ancient Indian system of ayurveda and yoga in 1995 He founded the The Chopra Center for Well Being in California. This serves as a vehicle for spreading his message of alternative medicine and holistic well being. He sees his mission as
His main teaching and beliefs are that to attain happiness we need to consider several things. Firstly we should find time for meditation and silencing the mind. This helps us to avoid negative emotions and thoughts. Deepak stresses that negative emotions are like toxins just like bad food could be. He also teaches that we should try to listen to the signals of our body and develop our intuition. With regard to physical health he says there is a close connection between our physical health and our state of mind. This is why he is often associated as one of the pre-eminent leaders of the mind body spirit movement. To improve physical health he says we should be very careful about what we eat. Also if we can eat in the right consciousness then it will help.
One of his most popular and successful books is the Seven Secrets of Success. In this book he says that to lead a successful (and happy) life it is important to consider the importance of following one’s true path in life (dharma) with an attitude of detachment and self giving. Like the Hindu yoga systems he also believes in the law of karma. (cause and effect). Although he shares many belief systems of Hinduism and yoga he does not seek to promote a version of Hinduism in his lectures and support groups. Although this has not stopped anti cult Christian groups such as The Christian Research Institute from criticising him for “bringing in Hinduism” through the back door. Such criticisms are widely repeated against many “new age” teachers and gurus.
In 1996 the Weekly Standard. Published an article by Matt Labash that reported allegations against Chopra. These were denied and Chopra sued both the magazine and Matt Labash for libel. The magazine  agreed to a settlement when the main witnesses appeared as unreliable. The magazine later published an apology.
Deepak Chopra has had over 42 books published selling over 20 million copies world wide. His books range from translations of the Sufi poet Rumi to “A Holistic Guide to Pregnancy and Childbirth” As a public speaker he is also in great demand and has appeared as a keynote speaker at many prestigious events including the inauguration of the State of the World Forum, hosted by Mikhail Gorbachev.
Dr. Chopra is a fellow of the American College of Physicians and a member of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists.

=======================================================
=======================================================
Deepak Chopra (born 1946) is an alternative medicine expert to some, and a money-making guru to others. He has sold over 10 million books in 30 languages, and is a friend and advisor to celebrities. His core belief, as Richard Acello of the San Diego Business Journal noted, is "that the human body and spirit are intimately connected."Born in New Delhi, India in 1946, Deepak Chopra was the eldest son of Krishan Chopra, a prominent cardiologist who served as the dean of a local hospital and a lieutenant in the British army. Chopra and his younger brother Sanjiv were raised in a privileged Hindu household. They read the classics of British literature and memorized the streets of London.In high school, Chopra wanted to be a journalist or an actor. It was a character in the Sinclair Lewis story Arrowsmith, that inspired him to become a doctor. In his 1988 autobiography, Return of the Rishi, Chopra described the Lewis novel: "It had what I needed - the hero was a doctor and the doctor was a hero. At moments he was almost a god, bringing healing to skeptical mortals like an angelic doctor."Chopra attended the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. He also developed an interest in existentialist philosophy. In 1995, he told Chip Brown in an Esquire, magazine interview, "I was motivated by an idealistic fever to find what you would call, for lack of any other expression, the meaning of life. I'm still struggling with that."Practiced Medicine in the United StatesChopra spent his first six months after completing medical school treating rural villagers in India. In 1970, at the age of 23, he came to the United States with his new wife, Rita. Chopra served as an intern for $200 a month at a 400-bed hospital in Plainfield, New Jersey. The hospital needed replacements for staff members who had been sent to Vietnam. His first duty as a doctor in the U.S. was to declare a patient dead. As he shared in Return of the Rishi, he soon learned that being a doctor had "little to do with healing and making people happy."Three years later, Chopra was board-certified in internal medicine and endocrinology, serving as a teaching and research fellow in endocrinology at a hospital affiliated with Tufts University. He worked in Boston-area hospitals, later spending a year in Everett, Massachusetts. In 1980, Chopra went to New England Memorial Hospital, where he was named chief-of-staff by the age of 35.Smoking too many cigarettes and drinking too much coffee and alcohol in an effort to relieve the stress of his busy life, Chopra decided that he had to make a change. He turned to his philosophical interests, reading a book on transcendental meditation (TM). The practice of TM helped him quit drinking, quit smoking, and unwind.Two Life-Changing MeetingsIn 1981, while on a trip to New Delhi, a friend took him to see a master Ayurvedic physician, Brihaspati Dev Triguna. Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word meaning "science of life," and focuses on balancing the flow of energy in the body. Triguna advised him to spend more time with his family and to take more time to sit quietly, among other things. The ancient wisdom of the Indian sages, or rishis, provided the basis for Chopra's new path. His visit to Triguna and its benefits to his own life, sparked his interest in pursuing an Ayurvedic approach to medicine.In 1985, Chopra met the founder of the TM movement, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, in Washington, D.C. The Maharishi, once a regular guest on the Tonight Show and spiritual advisor to the Beatles, had been promoting Ayurvedic medicine and marketing products for it. Chopra and his wife were invited by a colleague at Harvard to attend a lecture given by the Maharishi.After listening for several hours, the Chopras discreetly got up and walked into the lobby. Moments later, the Maharishi approached them, handing each a flower. He asked them to come up to his room. The two hesitated, knowing they would miss the last flight to Boston that night, but went anyway. They talked for two hours. "Maharishi did not lay out the details of Ayurveda for us that night, but he made the theme vividly clear. Health and disease are connected like variations on one melody. But disease is a wrong variation, a distortion of the theme," Chopra recalled in Return of the Rishi.Left Traditional MedicineChopra left his endocrinology practice to become the Maharishi's corporate officer and run an Ayurvedic clinic in Lancaster, Massachussets. In explaining why he left traditional medicine, Chopra told Acello, "I think it was just the fact that there is a lot of frustration when all you do is prescribe medication, you start to feel like a legalized drug pusher. That doesn't mean that all prescriptions are useless, but it is true that 80 percent of all drugs prescribed today are of optional or marginal benefit."Chopra did not give up material or personal success by leaving traditional medicine. He was the sole stockholder of Maharishi Ayur-Veda Products International until 1987, and was also a millionaire. In 1989, the Maharishi gave him a title that translated into "Lord of Immortality." Chopra's prolific writing career began soon after. In 1989, he published Quantum Healing: Exploring the Frontiers of Mind/ Body Medicine, which argued that one can overcome disease and stall the aging process through meditation and clean living. The next year, Chopra wrote Perfect Health: The Complete Mind/Body Guide. This was followed in 1991 by Unconditional Life: Discovering the Power to Fulfill Your Dreams. Chopra appeared on the popular television talk show, the Oprah Winfrey Show, to promote his latest book. Shortly after that appearance, it sold 130,000 copies in one day and Chopra was featured on the cover of People magazine.Opportunities in CaliforniaIn 1993, Chopra decided to go into business for himself, leaving the Maharishi's company. Of his break with the Maharishi, he told Brown in 1995, "Maharishi more or less told me I should stop writing books and doing workshops. I should either stay with him and join him in proselytizing, or leave." Chopra decided the time was right for a change. He and his wife and children, daughter Mallika, and son Gautama, left for La Jolla, California.Chopra went to work for Sharp Health Care in San Diego County. The Sharp Institute for Human Potential and Mind-Body Medicine was opened, with Chopra as its executive director. A $30,000 grant from the Office of Alternative Medicine in the National Institutes of Health helped fund a study of the impact of Ayurvedic methods in controlling blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, and stress. Chopra's plan for a book proving the efficacy of Ayurvedic methods was postponed, however. Having undergone a change in ownership in 1996, Sharp ended its association with Chopra and the Institute. Not long after, Chopra opened the Chopra Center of Well Being, a 14,000-square-foot facility on Fay Avenue in downtown La Jolla.Chopra never applied for a California medical license. He wanted to be free to teach and write, among other things, so he quit using "M.D." at the end of his name and started writing fiction. Chopra explored Celtic folklore in The Return of Merlin. He set up companies that would manage his seminars, media, and television appearances, as well as produce and sell Ayurvedic products. Chopra also set up a cable television station, the Global Healing Channel. He now has a multimedia company with six subsidiaries and over 100 employees called Infinite Possibilities International.Controversy and LawsuitsSome doctors have been opposed to Chopra's methods. Dr. Stephen Barret, author of The Health Robbers: A Close Look at Quackery in America, and William Jarvis, professor of public health at Loma Linda University and president of the National Council Against Health Fraud, have asserted that Chopra's theories are not subject to peer review.Tony Perry, writing for the Los Angeles Times noted that charges of sexual harassment, plagiarism, and libel have been leveled against the controversial physician. "Chopra is an aggressive adversary," he wrote. In 1997, the Weekly Standard, a Washington DC-based political magazine, was forced to issue an apology to Chopra, who had been referred to as a "huckster" and a "Hindu televangelist" in a feature story.Alternative Medicine Gained LegitimacyMany are impressed by Chopra and his beliefs. Members of the media have called him a "New Age superstar" and a "one man healing machine." In a 1996 feature story, Time magazine offered praise for his contribution, "Chopra may have done more than anyone else in the U.S. to create a vocabulary for the intersection of faith and medicine." Mainstream medicine has begun to listen. In November 1998, JAMA devoted an entire issue to alternative medicine."There's a whole grassroots movement in the United States that is dissatisfied with our prevailing system of medicine, where doctors have become superb technicians who know everything about the human body and really lousy healers because they know nothing about the human soul," Chopra told Lynn Sherr on Good Morning America on November 11, 1998.Other VenturesChopra has also entered the recording industry - with some help from the pop superstar, Madonna. In the fall of 1998, raSa records, a label that has a joint partnership with the New York-based hip hop label, Tommy Boy, released A Gift of Love. The album featured Chopra and friends reading the poems of Jalaluddin Rumi, a 13th-century Muslim mystic. American celebrities reading on the album included Madonna, Demi Moore, Martin Sheen, Blythe Danner, Goldie Hawn, and Debra Winger, among others. Composers Adam Plack and Yaron Fuchs created subtle background music.In addition to serving as the educational director of the Chopra Center for Well Being, Chopra also has a successful website (www.chopra.com) which features "the online store of infinite possibilities." Much material is offered free of charge. A different universal law is explained and a new meditation is offered every day. As Uri Geller explained in the Times of London, "Deepak believes in dharma, a force which directs your life when you agree to go with the flow. You cannot shape dharma - it happens. The multiple coincidences that appear to buffet your path are really synchronized aspects of destiny - synchrodestiny. It's an intriguing notion and one which he explains for free online."In looking at the success Chopra has enjoyed, Time reflected, "Other American doctors preceded him in their insights about the spirit's healing power. But Chopra, by accident of birth and nationality, was ideally positioned to tap into an entire pre-existing cultural tradition." Perry added, "People are listening to other voices, and Deepak Chopra is one of those voices."Further ReadingChopra, Deepak, Return of the Rishi, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1988.Austin American-Statesman, May 21, 1999.Business Daily, December 2, 1998.Chicago Tribune, September 13, 1995.Deseret News, February 15, 1996.Esquire, October 1, 1995.India Today Plus, March 1, 1996.Los Angeles Times, September 7, 1997; November 1, 1998.Newsweek, October 20, 1997.Palm Beach Post, April 7, 1998.San Diego Business Journal, October 20, 1997.Time, June 24, 1996.Times of London, August 11, 1999.Toastmaster, March, 1997.

Dubbed "the poet-prophet of alternative medicine" in the pages of Time, Deepak Chopra vaulted to international fame at the vanguard of the self-help publishing explosion, later expanding his multimedia empire to include a series of new age-themed albums recorded in collaboration with musicians including Eurythmics' Dave Stewart. Born in New Delhi in 1947, Chopra was the son of leading Indian cardiologist Krishran Chopra. He inevitably followed his father's footsteps and graduated from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in 1968. Upon relocating to the U.S. two years later, Chopra interned at a New Jersey hospital before continuing his studies at Burlington, MA's Lahey Clinic and the University of Virginia Hospital. A board-certified practitioner of internal medicine and endocrinology, Chopra taught at Tufts University and Boston University Schools of Medicine before he was appointed chief of staff at the New England Memorial Hospital. He also established his own private endocrinology practice, but following a return trip to New Delhi he found himself increasingly at odds with the guiding principles of Western medicine, embracing instead the paradigm that good health represents more than the mere absence of physical disease. In 1985, after meeting transcendental meditation founder and guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Chopra resigned his NEMH position to focus on holistic medicine, casting his lot with Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of natural healing, and founding the Massachusetts-based American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine.
In 1989, Chopra published his first book, Quantum Healing: Exploring the Frontiers of Mind/Body Medicine, combining elements of Hinduism and Western science to posit the body as a "network of intelligence" that can fight off disease and aging via meditation and clean living founded the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine. After splitting with the transcendental meditation faction in 1993 amid allegations the Maharishi was attempting to control his writing and speaking engagements, Chopra published his breakthrough effort, Ageless Body, Timeless Mind: The Quantum Alternative to Growing Old, selling more than 100,000 copies the day after his appearance on television's Oprah Winfrey Show. More than a dozen like-minded self-help bestsellers followed, among them The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success and The Path to Love: Spiritual Strategies for Healing. In 1995 Chopra founded the California-based Chopra Center for Well Being, essentially abandoning all pretense of clinical practice by declining to even apply for a state medical license. Despite pointed criticisms of his beliefs and practices -- as well as the hypocrisy of admonishing materialism while living in a multi-million-dollar mansion and driving a Jaguar -- Chopra remained an immensely popular figure, and after releasing a series of lucrative audiobooks, in 1998 he issued the album A Gift of Love, recruiting celebrity pals like Madonna and Goldie Hawn to read classical Indian poetry over Middle Eastern-inspired backing tracks. Three years later Chopra teamed with longtime friend Dave Stewart for Grow Younger, Live Longer. ~ Jason Ankeny, Rovi
Deepak Chopra (pron.: /ˈdiːpɑːk ˈtʃoʊprə/; born October 22, 1947) is an Indian-born American physician,[1] a holistic health/New Age guru,[2][3] and perhaps the wealthiest and most famous of America's alternative medicine practitioners.[4] Chopra has taught at the medical schools of Tufts University, Boston University and Harvard University. He became Chief of Staff at the New England Memorial Hospital (NEMH) in Massachusetts,[5] before establishing a private practice.[5] In 1985, Chopra met Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who invited him to study Ayurveda.[6][7] Chopra left his position at the NEMH and became the founding president of the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine, and was later named medical director of the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Center.[6][7][8]
In 1996, Chopra and neurologist David Simon founded the Chopra Center for Wellbeing, which incorporated Ayurveda in its regimen. The University of California, San Diego School of Medicine and the American Medical Association have granted continuing medical education credits for some programs offered to physicians at the Chopra Center.[5][6] In 2009, Chopra established the Chopra Foundation to advance the cause of mind/body spiritual healing, education, and research through fundraising for selected projects.[9]
Chopra has written more than 70 books, including 21 New York Times bestsellers. His books have been translated into 35 languages and sold more than 20 million copies worldwide.[10] Chopra has received many awards, including the Oceana Award (2009),[11] the Cinequest Life of a Maverick Award (2010),[12] Humanitarian Starlite Award (2010),[13] and the GOI Peace Award (2010).[14]
Chopra is a controversial figure. According to a 2008 article in Time magazine, he is "a magnet for criticism", primarily from those involved in science and medicine. His critics accuse him of creating a false sense of hope in sick individuals which may keep them away from effective medical care.[15]
Chopra was born in New Delhi, British India.[5][16] His father, Krishan Chopra (1919–2001) was a prominent Indian cardiologist, head of the department of medicine and cardiology at Mool Chand Khairati Ram Hospital, New Delhi, for over 25 years,[17] and a lieutenant in the British army.[5][16] His paternal grandfather was a sergeant in the British Army, who looked to Ayurveda for treatment for a heart condition when the condition did not improve with Western medicine.[18] Chopra's younger brother, Sanjiv, is a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and staff at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.[19]
As a young man, Chopra's desire was to become an actor or journalist, but he reports that he was inspired by a character in Arrowsmith by Sinclair Lewis and became a doctor.[12]
Chopra completed his primary education at St. Columba's School in New Delhi and graduated from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).[6]
Chopra's career falls into two parts. At first, Chopra adhered to mainstream medical practice; he then became an advocate of alternative medicine and a wealthy businessman[4] – continuing the long tradition of entrepreneurialism in the American medical system.[20]
After immigrating to the US in 1968, Chopra began his clinical internship and residency training at Muhlenberg Hospital in Plainfield, New Jersey. He had residency terms at the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Massachusetts, and at the University of Virginia Hospital.[5]
He earned his license to practice medicine in the state of Massachusetts in 1973[21] and received a California medical license in 2004.[22] Chopra is board-certified in internal medicine and specialized in endocrinology.[21] He is also a member of the American Medical Association (AMA).[23]
Chopra taught at the medical schools of Tufts University, Boston University and Harvard University. He became Chief of Staff at the New England Memorial Hospital in Stoneham, Massachusetts, later known as Boston Regional Medical Center, before establishing a private practice.[5]
After reading about the Transcendental Meditation technique (TM), Chopra and his wife learned the practice in 1981, and two months later they went on to learn the advanced TM-Sidhi program.[24] In a 1981 meeting between Chopra and Ayurvedic physician Brihaspati Dev Triguna in Delhi, India, Triguna advised Chopra to learn the TM technique.[6]
In 1985, Chopra met Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who invited him to study Ayurveda.[6][7] In that same year, Chopra left his position at the New England Memorial Hospital and became the founding president of the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine, and was later named medical director of the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Center for Stress Management and Behavioral Medicine.[6][7][8] He was initially the sole stockholder of Maharishi Ayurveda Products International, but divested after three months.[25] He has been called the TM movement's "poster boy" and "its leading Ayurvedic physician".[26] In 1989, the Maharishi awarded him with the title "Dhanvantari (Lord of Immortality), the keeper of perfect health for the world".[27]
By 1992, Chopra was serving on the National Institutes of Health ad hoc panel on alternative medicine.[10] In 1993, Chopra became executive director of the Sharp Institute for Human Potential and Mind–Body Medicine with a $30,000 grant from the Office of Alternative Medicine in the National Institutes to study Ayurvedic medicine.[6] Chopra's institute also maintained affiliation with Sharp Healthcare, in San Diego.[7][8] That same year Chopra moved with his family to Southern California where he lives with his wife and near his two adult children, Gotham and Mallika.[6]
Chopra left the Transcendental Meditation movement in January 1994. According to his own account, Chopra was accused by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi of attempting to compete with the Maharishi's position as guru.[28] Author Todd Carroll said Chopra left the TM organization when it “became too stressful” and was a “hindrance to his success”.[29]
In 1996, Chopra parted company with the Sharp Institute. That same year, Chopra and neurologist David Simon founded the Chopra Center for Wellbeing, which incorporated Ayurveda in its regimen, and was located in La Jolla, California. The University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine and American Medical Association have granted continuing medical education credits for some programs offered to physicians at the Chopra Center.[5][6][7] In 2002, Chopra and Simon relocated the Chopra Center to the grounds of La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad, California, continuing to offer mind-body wellness programs, medical consultations, and instruction in meditation, yoga, and Ayurveda.
Chopra and Simon also revived an ancient mantra-based meditation practice, traveling to India to study the origins of this technique, known as Primordial Sound Meditation. This form of meditation is now taught at the Chopra Center and by certified instructors who receive their training through Chopra Center University.
Chopra wrote about the contrast between spiritualism and science in his 2011 book War of the Worldviews - Science vs Spirituality, coauthored with CalTech Professor of Physics Leonard Mlodinow. In it he says he has a respect and admiration for the scientific method but he believes it has limitations and he contends there is a need for an expanded science that includes the reality and investigation of the observer, or consciousness.[30][31]
In 2005 Chopra was made a Senior Scientist at The Gallup Organization.[33] He currently serves as an Adjunct Professor of Executive Programs at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.[34]
He is also a weekly columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle, a regular contributor to The Washington Post's "On Faith" section and a prolific contributor to The Huffington Post.[35][36][37]
In 2006, Chopra launched Virgin Comics LLC with his son Gotham Chopra and entrepreneur Richard Branson. The company's purpose is to "spread peace and awareness through comics and trading cards that display traditional Kabalistic characters and stories."[5] Chopra was awarded the 2006 Ellis Island Medal of Honor by the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations.[40][41]
Chopra is heavily featured in UniGlobe Entertainment's cancer docudrama titled 1 a Minute talking about mind, body, spirit and the mystery of life and death.[42] The documentary is directed by actress Namrata Singh Gujral and also features cancer survivors Olivia Newton-John, Diahann Carroll, Melissa Etheridge, Mumtaz and Jaclyn Smith.
A friend of Michael Jackson for 20 years, Chopra has criticized the "cult of drug-pushing doctors, with their co-dependent relationships with addicted celebrities", saying that he hoped Jackson's death, attributed to an overdose of a prescription drug, would be a call to action.[43]
O'Har (2000) sees Chopra as an exemplification of the fact that human beings need "magic" in their lives, and places "the sophistries of Chopra" alongside the emotivism of Oprah Winfrey, the special effects and logic of Star Trek, and the magic of Harry Potter.[44]
According to Baer (2003), Chopra – as a wealthy individual – is an example of the American success story,[45] but one who has failed to explore some of the potential benefits of a truly alternative, holistic approach to health. Instead he merely offers an alternative form of medical hegemony, focused on the individual — particularly well-off members of the upper and middle-classes; the "worried well".[46]
Gamel (2008) also acknowledges Chopra's business success, thinking him "perhaps the wealthiest" of America's alternative medicine practitioners.[4] Medically, Gamel regards Chopra as a throwback to an age of ineffective remedies, dominated by the placebo effect of "touchy-feely therapies."[47]
Reviewing Susan Jacoby's book, The Age of American Unreason, Kaminer (2008) sees Chopra's popular reception in America as being symptomatic of many Americans' historical inability (as Jacoby puts it) "to distinguish between real scientists and those who peddled theories in the guise of science". Chopra's "nonsensical references to quantum physics" are placed in a lineage of American religious pseudoscience, extending back through Scientology to Christian Science.[48]
In August 2005, Chopra wrote a series of articles on the creation-evolution controversy and Intelligent design which were criticized by science writer Michael Shermer, founder of The Skeptics Society.[49][50][51]
Chopra has been criticized for his frequent references to the relationship of quantum mechanics to healing processes, a connection that has drawn skepticism from physicists who say it can be considered as contributing to the general confusion in the popular press regarding quantum measurement, decoherence and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.[52] In 1998, Chopra was awarded the satirical Ig Nobel Prize in physics for "his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life, liberty, and the pursuit of economic happiness".[53] According to the book Skeptics Dictionary, Chopra's "mind-body claims get even murkier as he tries to connect Ayurveda with quantum physics.”[29] Chopra also participated in the Channel 4 (UK) documentary The Enemies of Reason, where, when interviewed by scientist Richard Dawkins, he admitted that the term "quantum theory" was being used as a metaphor and that it has little to do with the actual quantum theory in physics.[54]
In 2012, reviewing War of the Worldviews – a book co-authored by Deepak Chopra and Leonard Mlodinow – physics professor Mark Alford explains that the work is set out as a debate between the two authors, "[covering] all the big questions: cosmology, life and evolution, the mind and brain, and God." Alford considers the two sides of the debate a false opposition, and concludes that "the counterpoint to Chopra's speculations is not science, with its complicated structure of facts, theories, and hypotheses, but something much more basic. The antidote to Chopra is Occam."[55]
According to a 2008 article in Time magazine, Chopra is “a magnet for criticism”, primarily from those involved in science and medicine. The Time article summarized Chopra's reception and popularity thus: "Of all the Asian gurus…, Chopra has arguably been the most successful at erasing apparent differences between East and West by packaging Eastern mystique in credible Western garb. …His quest to construct a pleasing and seamless model of the universe tends to jump to easy conclusions and to spackle over problematic gaps and inconsistencies in the ideas he presents — is obvious to all but his most starry-eyed fans. But grousing about such crimes — as many do — does little to explain his enormous popularity. Chopra is as rich as he is today not because he has been dishonest with anyone, but because his basic message — that love, health and happiness are possible, that mystery is real and that the universe is ultimately a friendly and benevolent place where orthodoxies old and new can meet and make peace with one another — is one that he wants to believe in just as sincerely as his readers do."[56][57]
In March 2010, Chopra and Jean Houston debated Sam Harris and Michael Shermer at Caltech on the question "Does God Have a Future?" Shermer and Harris criticized Chopra's use of scientific terminology to expound unrelated spiritual concepts.[58] Shermer has said that Chopra is "the very definition of what we mean by pseudoscience".[58]
In April 2010, Aseem Shukla criticized Chopra for suggesting that yoga did not have origins in Hinduism but is an older Indian spiritual tradition which predated Hinduism.[59] Later on, Chopra explained yoga as rooted in "consciousness alone" which is a universal, non-sectarian eternal wisdom of life expounded by Vedic rishis long before historic Hinduism ever arose. He further accused Aseem Shukla of having a "fundamentalist agenda". Dr. Shukla in a rejoinder titled "Dr. Chopra: Honor thy heritage" termed Deepak Chopra as an exponent of the art of "How to Deconstruct, Repackage and Sell Hindu Philosophy Without Calling it Hindu!" and to the allegation of "fundamentalist" he responded by accusing Chopra of raising the "bogey of communalism" in frustration to divert the argument.[60][61]
According to Business Week, one of Chopra's main messages is that by ridding oneself of negative emotions and developing intuition by listening to signals from the body, health can be improved. According to Chopra, slowing down or reversing the aging of the mind through his methods can increase one's lifespan up to the age of 120 years. As a result of his writings and lectures in this area, he is thought by some to be "one of the pre-eminent leaders of the mind-body-spirit movement".[12]
In its May 22/29, 1991 issue, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published an article coauthored by Chopra, Hari M. Sharma, and Brihaspati Dev Triguna: "Letter from New Delhi: Maharishi Ayur-Veda: Modern Insights Into Ancient Medicine".[62] JAMA editors claimed that Chopra and his co-authors had financial interests in "Maharishi Vedic Medicine" products and services. In the August 14, 1991 edition of JAMA, the editors published a financial disclosure correction[63] and followed up on October 2, 1991 with a six-page Medical News and Perspectives exposé.[64] An article discussing this chain of events was authored by Andrew A. Skolnick in the Newsletter of the National Association of Science Writers.[65] A 1992 defamation lawsuit brought against the article's author and the editor of JAMA was dismissed in 1993.[66][67] Media reports published four years later saying that there had been a monetary settlement of the case were later withdrawn as untrue.[68]
Chopra was sued for copyright infringement by Robert Sapolsky for using a stress endocrine chart without proper attribution, after the publication of Chopra’s book Ageless Body, Timeless Mind.[69] An out-of-court settlement resulted in Chopra attributing material that was researched by Sapolsky.[57] Chopra acknowledges that his thought has been inspired by Jiddu Krishnamurti and others.[29][70]
In 1996, The Weekly Standard published an article which accused Chopra of "plagiarism and soliciting a prostitute"; however, Chopra sued and the paper withdrew its statements and published an apology.[71]
In 1995, Chopra was the recipient of the Toastmasters "International Top Five Outstanding Speakers" award.[72] In 1997, Chopra was given the Golden Gavel Award by Toastmasters.[73][dead link]
He was presented the Medal of the Presidency of the Italian Republic awarded by the Pio Manzu International Scientific Committee. In the citation committee chairman and former Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev referred to Chopra as "one of the most lucid and inspired philosophers of our time".[74] Esquire magazine designated him as one of the "top ten motivational speakers in the country".[12][72]
He was the recipient in 2009 of the Oceana Award.[75] Also in 2009, Chopra established the Chopra Foundation with a mission to advance the cause of mind/body spiritual healing, education, and research through fundraising for selected projects.[76] In 2010 the Chopra Foundation sponsored the first Sages and Scientists Symposium, attended by a number of scientists, social scientists and artists from around the world, with a second symposium hosted in February 2011. The third symposium is scheduled for March 2012[77] with seminars relating to Alzheimer's Disease and "Past Life Memories" amongst others.[78]
In 2010, Chopra received the Cinequest Life of a Maverick Award for his collaborations with filmmakers Shekhar Kapur and his son, Gotham Chopra. The award goes to "inspirational individuals who touch the world of film while their greater lives exemplify the Maverick spirit."[12]
He received the 2010 Humanitarian Starlite Award "for his global force of human empowerment, well-being and for bringing light to the world."[79] Chopra is the recipient of the 2010 GOI Peace Award.[80]
Chopra has written more than 70 books with 21 New York Times bestsellers. His books have been translated into 35 languages and sold more than 20 million copies worldwide.[10] His book Peace Is the Way won the Quill Awards and The Book of Secrets: Unlocking the Hidden Dimensions of your Life received the Nautilus Award. FINS - Wall Street Journal, mentioned his book, “The Soul of Leadership”, as one of five best business books of 2011 to read for your career. Chopra is represented in the United States by the literary agency Trident Media Group.[81] His first book, Creating Health, is credited with helping to create initial, international recognition for Chopra.[5]

To say that prayers are answered isn't the same as saying that God answers prayers. In the first case, a thought manifests as reality. You wish, intend, or ask for an outcome, and the outcome appears. In the second case, a supernatural being in the sky listens to millions of...
Without taking a poll, it's safe to say that people who believe in God also believe that he answers prayers. If he didn't, one would be left with an indifferent, distant deity who pays no attention to human affairs. This alternative is hard to reconcile with faith, and so believers...
 By Deepak Chopra MD, Menas Kafatos, PhD., Subhash Kak, PhD., Rudolph E. Tanzi, PhD., and Neil Theise, MD A radically new view of reality is gaining ground, and its basic idea is thrilling: We live in a conscious universe. In the first two posts of this series...
Many of you may already know how vocal I have been in the past year regarding Wikipedia's bias covering such topic matters as mind body studies, new science, and of course my friend Rupert Sheldrake's biography page. Since Rupert and I began to speak out about the level of abuse...
By Deepak Chopra MD, Menas Kafatos, PhD., Subhash Kak, PhD., Rudolph E. Tanzi, PhD., and Neil Theise, MD   For at least two thousand years thinkers have tried to explain the human mind and disagreed heatedly, but a consensus has formed around one thing. When you try to figure out where the mind comes from, you...
By Deepak Chopra MD, Menas Kafatos, Ph.D., Subhash Kak, Ph.D., Neil Theise, Rudolph E. Tanzi, PhD., and Neil Theise, MDFor twenty years a conference bubbling with enthusiasm has taken place in Tucson to figure out the origins of the human mind. Its title is Toward...
For more than a decade the media have been eagerly reporting on exciting advances in brain research and genetics, which arrive almost monthly. These areas of science have become immensely confident and hopeful. They are the finger posts to a time when age-old mysteries about human nature will be explained...
It's commonly accepted that science and spirituality are not compatible. Science is considered our reliable way forward, while spirituality often regarded as a sentimental relic of our past we can't quite let go of. So to say it is necessary for the two to work together may seem unrealistic. For...
In the pursuit of knowledge about the universe, recent discoveries have pushed earlier than the Big Bang, bringing physics to the point when the early universe was doubling in size every hundredth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second. Such fine-scale measurement is awe-inspiring. The...
One of the biggest stumbling blocks for people who want to believe in God is the existence of bad things in our lives. The evening news carries enough stories about war, crime, famine, oppression, and much else that a loving God wouldn't permit. But as we saw in the first...
In every spiritual tradition, different as they are, God is taken to be the moral compass for human beings. He may or may not be a punisher. He may or may not sit in judgment, watching and weighing our every move. He may or may not be a He, since...
Even at a time when religion is declining in the West, most people remember the Biblical saying "As you sow, so shall you reap." They cling to a belief taught in childhood, that good is rewarded and evil punished. In the first post we started to look at the possibility...
We live in an especially dispirited time when people say, totally without irony, "Life is unfair" and "No good deed goes unpunished." Is there proof that life is, in fact, fair or unfair? The question doesn't even make sense if you believe that the universe is cold, random and devoid...
I appreciate the four pillars that Arianna Huffington advocates in her new book, Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder, but one of them - wisdom - will have a hard time thriving. She defines wisdom as reconnecting with one's inner...
 by Deepak Chopra, MD and Stuart Hameroff, MD, Anesthesiology, Psychology, Center for Consciousness Studies, The University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona The nature of consciousness, the reality it conveys, and our place in the universe remains unknown. Since ancient times, two types of views have approached these problems. In Western...
By Deepak Chopra, MD, Menas C. Kafatos, Ph.D., and Subhash Kak, Ph.D. We all live in the common-sense world, trusting in our five senses as if they transmit all reality to us. Yet the quantum revolution, as we've detailed in the last two posts, long ago undermined such a world...
By Deepak Chopra, MD, Menas Kafatos, Ph.D., and Subhash Kak, Ph.D. Although everyone as a practical matter accepts "reality as given" -- the world presented by the five senses -- that common-sense version of the world was radically undermined over a century ago with the advent of relativity and quantum...
By Deepak Chopra, MD, Menas Kafatos, Ph.D., and Subhash Kak, Ph.D. Despite their many divergences, science and philosophy are both led forward by reality. This is inevitable if facts, concepts, axioms, and other mental models are to be reliable. There are two ongoing projects, thousands of years old by now,...
Deepak Chopra, M.D., FACP and Rudolph E. Tanzi, Ph.D. There are two reasons why radical well being hasn't captured the imagination of the general public. As we saw in the first part, people all too often let their health go and then depend on the standard medical approach of drugs...
By Deepak Chopra, M.D. and Rudolph E. Tanzi, Ph.D. As far as our health goes, America is about a little of this and a lot of that. The little is self-care, the lot is drugs and surgery. Thirty years after a mind-body revolution took place in medicine and 50 years...
