Mel Colm-Cille Gerard Gibson AO (born January 3, 1956) is an actor, film director, producer and screenwriter. He was born in Peekskill, New York, moved with his parents to Sydney, when he was 12 years old, and later studied acting at the Australian National Institute of Dramatic Art.
After appearing as an action hero during the 1980s, Gibson went on to found Icon Entertainment, a Production Company which independent film director Atom Egoyan has called, "an alternative to the studio system."[2]
In 1995, Gibson produced, directed, and starred in the Academy Award-winning Braveheart. In 2004, he directed and produced The Passion of the Christ, a controversial film depicting the last hours in the life of Jesus Christ.
Gibson was born in Peekskill, New York, the sixth of eleven children, and the second son of Hutton Gibson and Irish-born Anne Patricia (née Reilly, died 1990).[3][4] His paternal grandmother was opera contralto Eva Mylott (1875–1920), who was born in Australia, to Irish parents,[5] while his paternal grandfather had English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh ancestry.[citation needed] One of Gibson's younger brothers, Donal, is also an actor. Gibson's first name comes from Saint Mel, fifth-century Irish saint, and founder of Gibson's mother's native diocese, Ardagh, while his second name, Colm-Cille,[6] is also shared by an Irish saint[7] and is the name of the parish in County Longford where Gibson's mother was born and raised. Because of his mother, Gibson holds dual Irish and American citizenship.[8]
Soon after being awarded US$145,000 in a work-related-injury lawsuit against New York Central Railroad on February 14, 1968, Hutton Gibson relocated his family to West Pymble, Sydney.[9] Mel Gibson was 12 years old at the time. The move to Hutton's mother's native Australia was for economic reasons, and because Hutton thought the Australian Defence Forces would reject his oldest son for the draft during the Vietnam War.[1]
Gibson was educated by members of the Congregation of Christian Brothers at St Leo's Catholic College in Wahroonga, New South Wales, during his high school years.[10][11]
Gibson gained very favorable notices from film critics when he first entered the cinematic scene, as well as comparisons to several classic movie stars. In 1982, Vincent Canby wrote that "Mr. Gibson recalls the young Steve McQueen... I can't define "star quality," but whatever it is, Mr. Gibson has it."[12] Gibson has also been likened to "a combination Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart."[13] Gibson's roles in the "Mad Max" series of films, Peter Weir's Gallipoli, and the "Lethal Weapon" series of films earned him the label of "action hero".[14] Later, Gibson expanded into a variety of acting projects including human dramas such as Hamlet, and comedic roles such as those in Maverick and What Women Want. He expanded beyond acting into directing and producing, with: The Man Without a Face, in 1993; Braveheart, in 1995; The Passion of the Christ, in 2004; and Apocalypto, in 2006. Jess Cagle of Time compared Gibson with Cary Grant, Sean Connery, and Robert Redford.[14] Connery once suggested Gibson should play the next James Bond to Connery's M. Gibson turned down the role, reportedly because he feared being typecast.[15]
Gibson studied at the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) in Sydney. The students at NIDA were classically trained in the British-theater tradition rather than in preparation for screen acting.[16] As students, Gibson and actress Judy Davis played the leads in Romeo and Juliet, and Gibson played the role of Queen Titania in an experimental production of A Midsummer Night's Dream.[17] After graduation in 1977,[18] Gibson immediately began work on the filming of Mad Max, but continued to work as a stage actor, and joined the State Theatre Company of South Australia in Adelaide. Gibson's theatrical credits include the character Estragon (opposite Geoffrey Rush) in Waiting for Godot, and the role of Biff Loman in a 1982 production of Death of a Salesman in Sydney. Gibson's most recent theatrical performance, opposite Sissy Spacek, was the 1993 production of Love Letters by A. R. Gurney, in Telluride, Colorado.[19]
While a student at NIDA, Gibson made his film debut in the 1977 film Summer City, for which he was paid $400.[20]
Gibson then played the title character in the film Mad Max (1979). He was paid $15000 for this role.[20] Shortly after making the film he did a season with the South Australian Theatre Company. During this period he shared a $30 a week apartment in Adelaide with his future wife Robyn. After Mad Max Gibson also played a mentally slow youth in the film Tim.[21]
During this period Gibson also appeared in Australian television series guest roles. He appeared in serial The Sullivans as naval lieutenant Ray Henderson,[22] in police procedural Cop Shop,[21] and in the pilot episode of prison serial Punishment which was produced in 1980, screened 1981.[23][24]
Gibson joined the cast of the World War II action film Attack Force Z, which was not released until 1982 when Gibson had become a bigger star. Director Peter Weir cast Gibson as one of the leads in the critically acclaimed World War I drama Gallipoli, which earned Gibson another Best Actor Award from the Australian Film Institute.[25] The film Gallipoli also helped to earn Gibson the reputation of a serious, versatile actor and gained him the Hollywood agent Ed Limato. The sequel Mad Max 2 was his first hit in America (released as The Road Warrior). In 1982 Gibson again attracted critical acclaim in Peter Weir's romantic thriller The Year of Living Dangerously. Following a year hiatus from film acting after the birth of his twin sons, Gibson took on the role of Fletcher Christian in The Bounty in 1984. Playing Max Rockatansky for the third time in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, in 1985, earned Gibson his first million dollar salary.[26]
Mel Gibson's first American film was Mark Rydell's 1984 drama The River, in which he and Sissy Spacek played struggling Tennessee farmers. Gibson then starred in the Gothic romance Mrs. Soffel for Australian director Gillian Armstrong. He and Matthew Modine played condemned convict brothers opposite Diane Keaton as the warden's wife who visits them to read the Bible. In 1985, after working on four films in a row, Gibson took almost two years off at his Australian cattle station.[27] He returned to play the role of Martin Riggs in Lethal Weapon, a film which helped to cement his status as a Hollywood "leading man".[28] Gibson's next film was Robert Towne's Tequila Sunrise, followed by Lethal Weapon 2, in 1989. Gibson next starred in three films back-to-back: Bird on a Wire, Air America, and Hamlet; all were released in 1990.
During the 1990s, Gibson alternated between commercial and personal projects. His films in the first half of the decade were Forever Young, Lethal Weapon 3, Maverick, and Braveheart. He then starred in Ransom, Conspiracy Theory, Lethal Weapon 4, and Payback. Gibson also served as the speaking and singing voice of John Smith in Disney's Pocahontas.
In 2000, Gibson acted in three films that each grossed over $100 million: The Patriot, Chicken Run, and What Women Want.[14] In 2002, Gibson appeared in the Vietnam War drama We Were Soldiers and M. Night Shyamalan's Signs, which became the highest-grossing film of Gibson's acting career.[29] While promoting Signs, Gibson said that he no longer wanted to be a movie star and would only act in film again if the script were truly extraordinary. In 2010, Gibson appeared in Edge of Darkness, which marked his first starring role since 2002[30] and was an adaptation of the BBC miniseries, Edge of Darkness.[31] In 2010, following an outburst at his ex-girlfriend that was made public, Gibson was dropped from the talent agency of William Morris Endeavor.[32]
After his success in Hollywood with the Lethal Weapon series, Gibson began to move into producing and directing. With partner Bruce Davey, Gibson formed Icon Productions in 1989 in order to make Hamlet.[33] In addition to producing or co-producing many of Gibson's own star vehicles, Icon has turned out many other small films, ranging from Immortal Beloved to An Ideal Husband. Gibson has taken supporting roles in some of these films, such as The Million Dollar Hotel and The Singing Detective. Gibson has also produced a number of projects for television, including a biopic on The Three Stooges and the 2008 PBS documentary Carrier. Icon has grown from being just a production company to also be an international distribution company and film exhibitor in Australia and New Zealand.[34]
In June 2010, Gibson was in Brownsville, Texas, filming scenes for the movie, How I Spent My Summer Vacation, about a career criminal put in a tough prison in Mexico.[35] In October 2010, it was reported[by whom?] that Gibson would have a small role in The Hangover: Part II,[36] but he was removed from the film after the cast and crew objected to his involvement.[37]
Mel Gibson has credited his directors, particularly George Miller, Peter Weir, and Richard Donner, with teaching him the craft of filmmaking and influencing him as a director. According to Robert Downey, Jr., studio executives encouraged Gibson in 1989 to try directing, an idea he rebuffed at the time.[38] Gibson made his directorial debut in 1993 with The Man Without a Face, followed two years later by Braveheart, which earned Gibson the Academy Award for Best Director. Gibson had long planned to direct a remake of Fahrenheit 451, but in 1999 the project was indefinitely postponed because of scheduling conflicts.[39] Gibson was scheduled to direct Robert Downey, Jr. in a Los Angeles stage production of Hamlet in January 2001, but Downey's drug relapse ended the project.[40] In 2002, while promoting We Were Soldiers and Signs to the press, Gibson mentioned that he was planning to pare back on acting and return to directing.[41] In September 2002, Gibson announced that he would direct a film called The Passion in Aramaic and Latin with no subtitles because he hoped to "transcend language barriers with filmic storytelling."[42] In 2004, he released the controversial film The Passion of the Christ, with subtitles, which he co-wrote, co-produced, and directed. The film went on to become the highest grossing rated R film of all time with $370,782,930 in U.S. box office sales.[43] Gibson directed a few episodes of Complete Savages for the ABC network. In 2006, he directed the action-adventure film Apocalypto, his second film to feature sparse dialogue in a non-English language.
Gibson's acting career began in 1976, with a role on the Australian television series The Sullivans. In his career, Gibson has appeared in 43 films, including the Mad Max and Lethal Weapon film series. In addition to acting, Gibson has also directed four films, including Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ; produced 11 films; and written two films. Films either starring or directed by Mel Gibson have earned over US$2.5 billion, in the United States alone.[44][45] Gibson's filmography includes television series, feature films, television films, and animated films.[citation needed]
Gibson got his breakthrough role as the leather-clad post-apocalyptic survivor in George Miller's Mad Max. The independently financed blockbuster helped to make him an international star everywhere but in the United States, where the actors' Australian accents were dubbed with American accents.[46] The original film spawned two sequels: Mad Max 2 (known in North America as The Road Warrior), and Mad Max 3 (known in North America as Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome). A fourth movie, Mad Max 4: Fury Road, is in development, but both Gibson and George Miller have indicated that the starring role would go to a younger actor.[47]
The 1981 Peter Weir film, Gallipoli is about a group of young men from rural Western Australia who enlist in the Australian Imperial Force during World War I. They are sent to invade the Ottoman Empire, where they take part in the 1915 Gallipoli Campaign. During the course of the movie, the young men slowly lose their innocence about the war. The climax of the movie centers around the catastrophic AIF offensive known as the Battle of the Nek.
Peter Weir cast Gibson in the role of Frank Dunne, an Irish-Australian drifter with an intense cynicism about fighting for the British Empire. Newcomer Mark Lee was recruited to play the idealistic Archy Hamilton after participating in a photo session for the director. Gibson later recalled:
"I'd auditioned for an earlier film and he told me right up front, 'I'm not going to cast you for this part. You're not old enough. But thanks for coming in, I just wanted to meet you.' He told me he wanted me for Gallipoli a couple of years later because I wasn't the archetypal Australian. He had Mark Lee, the angelic-looking, ideal Australian kid, and he wanted something of a modern sensibility. He thought the audience needed someone to relate to of their own time."[48]
Gibson later said that Gallipolli is, "Not really a war movie. That's just the backdrop. It's really the story of two young men."
The critically acclaimed film helped to further launch Gibson's career.[49] He won the award for Best Actor in a Leading Role from the Australian Film Institute.[25]
Gibson played a naïve but ambitious journalist opposite Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hunt in Peter Weir's atmospheric 1982 film The Year of Living Dangerously, based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Koch. The movie was both a critical and commercial success, and the upcoming Australian actor was heavily marketed by MGM studio. In his review of the film, Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, "If this film doesn't make an international star of Mr. Gibson, then nothing will. He possesses both the necessary talent and the screen presence."[50] According to John Hiscock of The Daily Telegraph, the film did, indeed, establish Gibson as an international talent.[51]
Gibson was initially reluctant to accept the role of Guy Hamilton. "I didn't necessarily see my role as a great challenge. My character was, like the film suggests, a puppet. And I went with that. It wasn't some star thing, even though they advertised it that way."[52] Gibson saw some similarities between himself and the character of Guy. "He's not a silver-tongued devil. He's kind of immature and he has some rough edges and I guess you could say the same for me."[13] Gibson has cited this screen performance as his personal favorite.[when?]
Gibson followed the footsteps of Errol Flynn, Clark Gable, and Marlon Brando by starring as Fletcher Christian in a cinematic retelling of the Mutiny on the Bounty. The resulting 1984 film The Bounty is considered to be the most historically accurate version. However, Gibson has expressed a belief that the film's revisionism did not go far enough. He has stated that his character should have been portrayed as the film's antagonist. He has further praised Anthony Hopkins's performance as Lieutenant William Bligh as the best aspect of the film.[52]
Gibson moved into more mainstream commercial filmmaking with the popular buddy cop Lethal Weapon series, which began with the 1987 original. In the films he played LAPD Detective Martin Riggs, a recently widowed Vietnam veteran with a death wish and a penchant for violence and gunplay. In the films, he is partnered with a reserved family man named Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover). Following the success of Lethal Weapon, director Richard Donner and principal cast revisited the characters in three sequels, Lethal Weapon 2 (1989), Lethal Weapon 3 (1993), and Lethal Weapon 4 (1998). With its fourth installment, the Lethal Weapon series embodied "the quintessence of the buddy cop pic".[53]
Gibson made the unusual transition from the action to classical genres, playing William Shakespeare's Danish prince in Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet. Gibson was cast alongside experienced Shakespearean actors Ian Holm, Alan Bates, and Paul Scofield. He compared working with Scofield to being "thrown into the ring with Mike Tyson".[54] Scofield said of Gibson "Not the sort of actor you'd think would make an ideal Hamlet, but he had enormous integrity and intelligence."[55]
In 1995, Mel Gibson directed, produced, and starred in Braveheart, a biopic of Sir William Wallace, a Scottish nationalist who was executed in 1305 for "high treason" against King Edward I of England. Gibson received two Academy Awards, Best Director and Best Picture, for his second directorial effort. In winning the Academy Award for Best Director, Gibson became only the sixth actor-turned-filmmaker to do so.[56] Braveheart influenced the Scottish nationalist movement and helped to revive the film genre of the historical epic; the Battle of Stirling Bridge sequence is considered by critics to be one of the all-time-best-directed battle scenes.[57]
The film's depiction of the Prince of Wales as an effeminate homosexual caused the film to be attacked by the Gay Alliance. The Gay Alliance was especially enraged by a scene in which King Edward I murders his son's male lover by throwing him out of a castle window.
Gibson, who had previously been reported making several homophobic statements,[58] now replied, "The fact that King Edward throws this character out a window has nothing to do with him being gay ... He's terrible to his son, to everybody."[59]
Gibson asserted that the reason that king Edward I kills his son's lover is because the king is a "psychopath".[60] Gibson also expressed bewilderment that some filmgoers laughed at this murder:
We cut a scene out, unfortunately ... where you really got to know that character (Edward II) and to understand his plight and his pain... But it just stopped the film in the first act so much that you thought, 'When's this story going to start?'[61]
Gibson directed, produced, co-wrote, and funded the 2004 film The Passion of the Christ, which chronicled the passion and death of Jesus (Jim Caviezel). The film was shot exclusively in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew. Although Gibson originally intended to release the film without subtitles; he eventually relented for theatrical exhibition. The film sparked divergent reviews, ranging from high praise to criticism of the violence.
The Anti-Defamation League further accused Gibson of anti-semitism over the film's unflattering depiction of Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin.
In The Nation, reviewer Katha Pollitt said, "Gibson has violated just about every precept of the (United States Conference of Catholic Bishops) conference's own 1988 'Criteria' for the portrayal of Jews in dramatizations of the Passion (no bloodthirsty Jews, no rabble, no use of Scripture that reinforces negative stereotypes of Jews, etc.) ... The priests have big noses and gnarly faces, lumpish bodies, yellow teeth; Herod Antipas and his court are a bizarre collection of oily-haired, epicene perverts. The 'good Jews' look like Italian movie stars (Italian sex symbol Monica Bellucci is Mary Magdalene); Mary, who would have been around 50 and appeared 70, could pass for a ripe 35."[62]
Among those to defend Gibson were Orthodox Jewish Rabbi Daniel Lapin and radio personality Michael Medved. Referring to ADL National Director Abraham Foxman, Rabbi Lapin said that by calling The Passion of the Christ anti-Semitic, "what he is saying is that the only way (for Christians) to escape the wrath of Foxman is to repudiate (their own) faith."
In an interview with the Globe and Mail, Gibson stated, "If anyone has distorted Gospel passages to rationalize cruelty towards Jews or anyone, it's in defiance of repeated Papal condemnation. The Papacy has condemned racism in any form... Jesus died for the sins of all times, and I'll be the first on the line for culpability".[63]
Eventually, the continued media attacks began to anger Gibson. After his father's Holocaust denial was sharply criticized in print by The New York Times writer Frank Rich,[64] Gibson retorted, "I want to kill him. I want his intestines on a stick.... I want to kill his dog."[65][66]
Gibson's Traditionalist Catholic upbringing was also the target of criticism. In a 2006 interview with Diane Sawyer, Gibson stated that he feels that his "human rights were violated" by the often vitriolic attacks on his person, his family, and his religious beliefs which were sparked by The Passion.[67]
The movie grossed US$611,899,420 worldwide and $370,782,930 in the US alone,[68] surpassing any motion picture starring Gibson.[69] In US box offices, it became the eighth (at the time) highest-grossing film in history[70] and the highest-grossing rated R film of all time.[71] The film was nominated for three Academy Awards[72] and won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Dramatic Motion Picture.[73]
Gibson received further critical acclaim for his directing of the 2006 action-adventure film Apocalypto.[74] Gibson's fourth directorial effort is set in Mesoamerica during the early 16th century against the turbulent end times of a Maya civilization. The sparse dialogue is spoken in the Yucatec Maya language by a cast of Native American descent.[75][76]
Gibson himself has stated that the film is an attempt at making a deliberate point about great civilizations and what causes them to decline and disintegrate. Gibson said, "People think that modern man is so enlightened, but we're susceptible to the same forces – and we are also capable of the same heroism and transcendence."[77][78] This theme is further explored by a quote from Will Durant, which is superimposed at the very beginning of the film: "A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."
Gibson starred in The Beaver, a film directed by former Maverick co-star Jodie Foster.[79] The Beaver premiered at The South by Southwest Festival in Austin, TX on March 16, 2011. The opening weekend in 22 theaters was considered a flop: it made $104,000 which comes to a per-theater average of $4,745.[80] The film's distributor, Summit Entertainment, had originally planned for a wide release of The Beaver for the weekend of 20 May, but after the initial box-office returns for the film, the company changed course and decided instead to give the film a "limited art-house run".[81] Michael Cieply of The New York Times observed on June 5, 2011, that the film had cleared just about $1 million, making it a certified "flop".[82] Director Jodie Foster opined that the film did not do well with American audiences because it was a dramedy, and "very often Americans are not comfortable with [that]".[83]
As of 2013, his cancelled projects included a film about the writing of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED),[84] and a Richard Donner-helmed film with the working title Sam and George.[85]
Asked in 2007 if he planned to return to acting and specifically to action roles, Gibson said: "I think I'm too old for that, but you never know. I just like telling stories. Entertainment is valid and I guess I'll probably do it again before it's over. You know, do something that people won't get mad with me for."[86]
He has also expressed an intention to direct a movie set during the Viking Age, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Like The Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto, he wants this speculative film to feature dialogue in period languages.[87] However, DiCaprio ultimately opted out of the project.[88] In a 2012 interview, Gibson announced that the project, which he has titled Berserker, was still moving forward.[89]
In 2011, it was announced that Gibson had commissioned a screenplay from Joe Eszterhas about the Maccabees. The film is to be distributed by Warner Brothers Pictures. The announcement generated significant controversy.[90] In April 2012, Eszterhas wrote a letter to Gibson accusing him of sabotaging their movie about the Maccabees because he "hates Jews", and citing a series of private incidents during which he allegedly heard Gibson express extremely racist views. Although written as a private letter, it was subsequently published on a film industry website.[91] In response, Gibson stated that he still intends to make the movie, but will not base it upon Eszterhas' script, which he called substandard.[92] Eszterhas then released audio tapes recorded secretly by his son of a number of Gibson's alleged "hateful rants".[93]
In a 2012 interview, Gibson explained that the Maccabees film was still in preparation. He explained that he was drawn to the Biblical account of the uprising due to its similarity to the American Old West genre.[89] Gibson is also set to appear as the lead villain in two action films: Luther Voz in Machete Kills in 2013 opposite Danny Trejo; and Conrad Stonebanks in The Expendables 3 in 2014 opposite Sylvester Stallone.
Gibson met Robyn Denise Moore in the late 1970s soon after filming Mad Max when they were both tenants at a house in Adelaide. At the time, Robyn was a dental nurse and Mel was an unknown actor working for the South Australian Theatre Company.[94] On June 7, 1980, Mel and Robyn Gibson were married in a Roman Catholic church in Forestville, New South Wales.[95] They have one daughter, six sons: Hannah (b. 1980), Edward (b. 1982), Christian (b. 1982), William (b. 1985), Louis (b. 1988), Milo (b. 1990), Thomas (b. 1999); and three grandchildren as of 2011[update].[96][97]
After 26 years of marriage, Mel and Robyn Gibson separated on July 29, 2006.[98][99] In a 2011 interview, Gibson stated that the separation began the day following his arrest for drunk driving in Malibu.[100] Robyn Gibson filed for divorce on April 13, 2009, citing irreconcilable differences. In a joint statement, the Gibsons declared, "Throughout our marriage and separation we have always strived to maintain the privacy and integrity of our family and will continue to do so."[6] The divorce filing followed the March 2009 release of photographs appearing to show him on a beach embracing Russian pianist Oksana Grigorieva.[101][102] Gibson's divorce was finalized on December 23, 2011, and the settlement with his ex-wife was said to be the highest in Hollywood history at over $400,000,000.[103]
On April 28, 2009, Gibson made a red carpet appearance with Grigorieva. Grigorieva, who had previously had a son with actor Timothy Dalton,[104] gave birth to Gibson's daughter Lucia (b. 2009).[105][106][107] In April 2010, it was made public that Gibson and Grigorieva had split.[108] On June 21, 2010, Grigorieva filed a restraining order against Gibson to keep him away from her and their child. The restraining order was modified the next day regarding Gibson's contact with their child.[109] Gibson obtained a restraining order against Grigorieva on June 25, 2010.[109][110] In response to claims by Grigorieva that an incident of domestic violence occurred in January 2010, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department launched a domestic violence investigation in July 2010.[111][112]
On July 9, 2010, some audio recordings alleged to be of Gibson were posted on the internet.[113] The same day Gibson was dropped by his agency, William Morris Endeavor.[113] Civil rights activists alleged that Gibson had shown patterns of racism, sexism and anti-Semitism and called for a boycott of Gibson's movies.[114]
Gibson's estranged wife, Robyn Gibson, filed a court statement declaring that she never experienced any abuse from Gibson,[115] while forensic experts have questioned the validity of some of the tapes.[116] In March 2011, Mel Gibson agreed to plead no contest to a misdemeanor battery charge.[117]
In April 2011, Gibson finally broke his silence about the incident in question. In an interview with Deadline.com, Gibson expressed gratitude to longtime friends Whoopi Goldberg and Jodie Foster, both of whom had spoken publicly in his defense. About the recordings, Gibson said,
I've never treated anyone badly or in a discriminatory way based on their gender, race, religion or sexuality – period. I don't blame some people for thinking that though, from the garbage they heard on those leaked tapes, which have been edited. You have to put it all in the proper context of being in an irrationally, heated discussion at the height of a breakdown, trying to get out of a really unhealthy relationship. It's one terribly awful moment in time, said to one person, in the span of one day and doesn't represent what I truly believe or how I've treated people my entire life.[100]
I was allowed to end the case and still maintain my innocence. It's called a West Plea[118] and it's not something that prosecutors normally allow. But in my case, the prosecutors and the judge agreed that it was the right thing to do. I could have continued to fight this for years and it probably would have come out fine. But I ended it for my children and my family. This was going to be such a circus. You don't drag other people in your life through this sewer needlessly, so I'll take the hit and move on.[100]
In August 2011, Gibson settled with Grigorieva and she was awarded $750,000, joint legal custody and a house in Sherman Oaks, California until their three-year-old daughter Lucia turns 18. In 2013, Grigorieva sued her attorneys accusing them of advising her to sign a bad agreement, including one with Gibson that holds her taking legal action against him would compromise her financial settlement.[119]
Gibson is a property investor, with multiple properties in Malibu, California, several locations in Costa Rica, a private island in Fiji and properties in Australia.[120][121] In December 2004, Gibson sold his 300-acre (1.2 km2) Australian farm in the Kiewa Valley for $6 million.[122] Also in December 2004, Gibson purchased Mago Island in Fiji from Tokyu Corporation of Japan for $15 million. Descendants of the original native inhabitants of Mago, who were displaced in the 1860s, have protested the purchase. Gibson stated it was his intention to retain the pristine environment of the undeveloped island.[123] In early 2005, he sold his 45,000-acre (180 km2) Montana ranch to a neighbour.[124] In April 2007 he purchased a 400-acre (1.6 km2) ranch in Costa Rica for $26 million, and in July 2007 he sold his 76-acre (310,000 m2) Tudor estate in Connecticut (which he purchased in 1994 for $9 million) for $40 million to an unnamed buyer.[125] Also that month, he sold a Malibu property for $30 million that he had purchased for $24 million two years before.[126] In 2008, he purchased the Malibu home of David Duchovny and Téa Leoni.[127]
Gibson has a reputation for practical jokes, puns, Stooge-inspired physical comedy, and doing outrageous things to shock people. As a director he sometimes breaks the tension on set by having his actors perform serious scenes wearing a red clown nose.[128] Helena Bonham Carter, who appeared alongside him in Hamlet, said of him, "He has a very basic sense of humor. It's a bit lavatorial and not very sophisticated."[129] During the filming of Hamlet, Gibson would relieve pressure on the set by mooning the cast and crew, directly following a serious scene.[130] In addition to inserting several homages to the Three Stooges in his Lethal Weapon movies, Gibson produced a 2000 television movie about the comedy group which starred Michael Chiklis as Curly Howard. As a gag,[citation needed] Gibson inserted a single frame of himself smoking a cigarette into the 2005 teaser trailer of Apocalypto.[131]
Gibson at the Christmas party for charity Mending Kids International in 2007. His former wife Robyn was president of the charity.
Gibson and his former wife have contributed a substantial amount of money to various charities, one of which is Healing the Children. According to Cris Embleton, one of the founders, the Gibsons gave millions to provide lifesaving medical treatment to needy children worldwide.[132][133] They also supported the restoration of Renaissance artwork[134] and gave millions of dollars to NIDA.[135]
Gibson donated $500,000 to the El Mirador Basin Project to protect the last tract of virgin rain forest in Central America and to fund archeological excavations in the "cradle of Mayan civilization."[136] In July 2007, Gibson again visited Central America to make arrangements for donations to the indigenous population. Gibson met with Costa Rican President Óscar Arias to discuss how to "channel the funds."[137] During the same month, Gibson pledged to give financial assistance to a Malaysian company named Green Rubber Global for a tire recycling factory located in Gallup, New Mexico.[138] While on a business trip to Singapore in September 2007, Gibson donated to a local charity for children with chronic and terminal illnesses.[139] Gibson is also a supporter of Angels at Risk, a nonprofit organization focusing on education about drug and alcohol abuse among teens.[140]
In a 2011 interview, Gibson said of his philanthropic works, "It gives you perspective. It's one of my faults, you tend to focus on yourself a lot. Which is not always the healthiest thing for your psyche or anything else. If you take a little time out to think about other people, it's good. It's uplifting."[141]
Gibson was raised a traditionalist Catholic.[1] When asked about the Catholic doctrine of "Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus", Gibson replied, "There is no salvation for those outside the Church ... I believe it. Put it this way. My wife is a saint. She's a much better person than I am. Honestly. She's... Episcopalian, Church of England. She prays, she believes in God, she knows Jesus, she believes in that stuff. And it's just not fair if she doesn't make it, she's better than I am. But that is a pronouncement from the chair. I go with it."[65][142] When he was asked whether John 14:6 is an intolerant position, he said that "through the merits of Jesus' sacrifice... even people who don't know Jesus are able to be saved, but through him."[143] Acquaintance Father William Fulco has said that Gibson denies neither the Pope nor Vatican II.[144] Gibson told Diane Sawyer that he believes non-Catholics and non-Christians can go to heaven.[67][145]
Gibson complimented filmmaker Michael Moore and his documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 when he and Moore were recognized at the 2005 People's Choice Awards.[147] Gibson's Icon Productions originally agreed to finance Moore's film, but later sold the rights to Miramax Films. Moore said that his agent Ari Emanuel claimed that "top Republicans" called Mel Gibson to tell him, "don't expect to get more invitations to the White House".[148] Icon's spokesman dismissed this story, saying "We never run from a controversy. You'd have to be out of your mind to think that of the company that just put out The Passion of the Christ."[149]
In a July 1995 interview with Playboy magazine, Gibson said President Bill Clinton was a "low-level opportunist" and someone was "telling him what to do". He said that the Rhodes Scholarship was established for young men and women who want to strive for a "new world order" and this was a campaign for Marxism.[150] Gibson later backed away from such conspiracy theories saying, "It was like: 'Hey, tell us a conspiracy'... so I laid out this thing, and suddenly, it was like I was talking the gospel truth, espousing all this political shit like I believed in it."[151] In the same 1995 Playboy interview, Gibson argued against ordaining women to the priesthood.[150][152][153]
In 2004, he publicly spoke out against taxpayer-funded embryonic stem-cell research that involves the cloning and destruction of human embryos.[154] In March 2005, he condemned the outcome of the Terri Schiavo case, referring to Schiavo's death as "state-sanctioned murder".[155]
Gibson questioned the Iraq War in March 2004.[156] In 2006, Gibson said that the "fearmongering" depicted in his film Apocalypto "reminds me a little of President Bush and his guys."[146]
The whole notion of politics is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why do you have to adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.[100]
Gibson has said that he started drinking at the age of 13.[157] In a 2002 interview about his time at NIDA, Gibson said, "I had really good highs but some very low lows. I found out recently I'm manic depressive."[158]
Gibson was banned from driving in Ontario for three months in 1984, after rear-ending a car in Toronto while under the influence of alcohol.[159] He retreated to his Australian farm for over a year to recover, but he continued to struggle with drinking. Despite this problem, Gibson gained a reputation in Hollywood for professionalism and punctuality such that Lethal Weapon 2 director Richard Donner was shocked when Gibson confided that he was drinking five pints of beer for breakfast.[67] Reflecting in 2003 and 2004, Gibson said that despair in his mid-30s led him to contemplate suicide, and he meditated on Christ's Passion to heal his wounds.[67][142][160] He took more time off acting in 1991 and sought professional help.[161] That year, Gibson's attorneys were unsuccessful at blocking the Sunday Mirror from publishing what Gibson shared at AA meetings.[162][clarification needed] In 1992, Gibson provided financial support to Hollywood's Recovery Center, saying, "Alcoholism is something that runs in my family. It's something that's close to me. People do come back from it, and it's a miracle."[163]
On July 28, 2006, Gibson was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) while speeding in his vehicle with an open container of alcohol, which is illegal in much of the United States. According to a 2011 article in Vanity Fair, Gibson first told the arresting officer, "My life is over. I'm fucked. Robyn's going to leave me."[164] According to the arrest report, Gibson exploded into an angry tirade when the arresting officer would not allow him to drive home. Gibson climaxed with the words, "Fucking Jews... the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world. Are you a Jew?"[165][166]
After the arrest report was leaked on TMZ.com, Gibson issued two apologies through his publicist,[167][168] and—in a televised interview with Diane Sawyer—he affirmed the accuracy of the quotations.[169] He further apologized for his "despicable" behavior, saying that the comments were "blurted out in a moment of insanity",[170] and asked to meet with Jewish leaders to help him "discern the appropriate path for healing."[171] After Gibson's arrest, his publicist said he had entered a recovery program to battle alcoholism.
On August 17, 2006, Gibson pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor drunken-driving charge and was sentenced to three years probation.[170] He was ordered to attend self-help meetings five times a week for four and a half months and three times a week for the remainder of the first year of his probation. He was also ordered to attend a First Offenders Program, was fined $1,300, and his license was restricted for 90 days.[170]
At a May 2007 progress hearing, Gibson was praised for his compliance with the terms of his probation and his extensive participation in a self-help program beyond what was required.[172]
In October 2011, Robert Downey, Jr., who has a history of overcoming legal problems and drug addiction, was honored at the 25th American Cinematheque Awards. Downey chose Gibson to present him with his award for his life's work. After Gibson's introduction, Downey did not discuss himself but instead explained he had chosen Gibson since he had helped Downey through his hardships. Downey then told the audience: "I humbly ask that you join me, unless you are completely without sin, and in which case you picked the wrong fucking industry, in forgiving my friend of his trespasses and offering him the same clean slate that you have me and allowing him to continue his great and ongoing contribution to our collective art without shame." After the speech, the two friends hugged onstage to applause.[173]

The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) accused Gibson of homophobia after a December 1991 interview in the Spanish newspaper El País in which he made derogatory comments about homosexuals.[58][153] Gibson later defended his comments[58] and rejected calls to apologize even as he faced fresh accusations of homophobia in the wake of his film Braveheart.[150] However, Gibson joined GLAAD in hosting 10 lesbian and gay filmmakers for an on-location seminar on the set of the movie Conspiracy Theory in January 1997.[174] In 1999 when asked about the comments to El País, Gibson said, "I shouldn't have said it, but I was tickling a bit of vodka during that interview, and the quote came back to bite me on the ass."[151]
Gibson's 2004 film The Passion of the Christ sparked a fierce debate over alleged antisemitic imagery and overtones. Gibson denied that the film was antisemitic, but critics remained divided. Some agreed that the film was consistent with the Gospels and traditional Catholic teachings, while others argued that it reflected a selective reading of the Gospels.
In July 2010, it was alleged that Gibson had been recorded during a phone call with Oksana Grigorieva suggesting that if she got "raped by a pack of niggers," she would be to blame.[175][176][177][178] Gibson was barred from coming near Grigorieva or her daughter due to a domestic violence-related restraining order.[175] The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department launched a domestic violence investigation against Gibson,[112] later dropped when Gibson pled no contest to a misdemeanor battery charge.[117]
On July 8, 2010, Gibson was alleged to have used the term "wetbacks" as he suggested turning in one of his employees to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.[113]
In 1985, Gibson was named the "Sexiest Man Alive" by People, the first person to be named so.[179] Gibson quietly declined the Chevalier des Arts et Lettres from the French government in 1995 as a protest against France's resumption of nuclear testing in the Southwest Pacific.[180] On July 25, 1997, Gibson was named an honorary Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), in recognition of his "service to the Australian film industry". The award was honorary because substantive awards are made only to Australian citizens.[181][182]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Mel Columcille Gerard Gibson was born on January 3, 1956, in Peekskill, New York, USA as the sixth of eleven children to parents Hutton Gibson, a railroad brakeman, and Ann Gibson, who was born in Australia and died in December of 1990. Though born in the US, Mel and his family moved to New South Wales, Australia. After high school, Mel studied at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, performing at the National Institute of Dramatic Arts alongside future film thespians Judy Davis and Geoffrey Rush. After college, Mel had a few stints on stage and starred in a few TV shows. Eventually, he was chosen to star in Mad Max (1979) and in a movie called Tim (1979), co-starring Piper Laurie. The small budgeted movie Mad Max (1979) made him known worldwide, while Tim (1979) garnered him an award for Best Actor from the Australian Film Institute (equivalent to the Oscar). Later, he went on to star in Gallipoli (1981), which earned him a second award for Best Actor from the AFI. In 1980, he married Robyn Moore and had seven children. In 1984, Mel made his American debut in The Bounty (1984), which co-starred Anthony Hopkins. Then in 1987, Mel starred in what would become his signature series, Lethal Weapon (1987), in which he played "Martin Riggs". In 1990, he took on the interesting starring role in Hamlet (1990), which garnered him some critical praise. He also made the more endearing Forever Young (1992) and the somewhat disturbing The Man Without a Face (1993). 1995 brought his most famous role as "Sir William Wallace" in Braveheart (1995), for which he won two Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director. From there, he made such box office hits as The Patriot (2000), Ransom (1996), and Payback (1999). Today, Mel remains an international superstar mogul, continuously topping the Hollywood power lists as well as the Most Beautiful and Sexiest lists.

Other members included actress Judy Davis and directors George Miller, Gillian Armstrong and Peter Weir.

      Ranked #10 in Premiere's 2004 annual "Power 100" list. Had ranked #15 in 2003. He is the highest-ranked actor on the 2004 list.
      Ranked number 1 on Forbes's 2004 "Celebrity 100 List". He was the highest paid celebrity in 2004 with a reported $210,000,000 salary from his The Passion of the Christ (2004) profits, plus a potential $150,000,000 that is yet to be accounted for. He made more money than Oprah Winfrey ($210,000,000), J.K. Rowling ($147,000,000), Tiger Woods & Michael Schumacher ($80,000,000 each) and Steven Spielberg ($75,000,000) in 2004.
      In the movie Forever Young (1992), he needed to appear older in the last few scenes. Because his eyes were so bright blue, no matter how many wrinkles they put on him, he did not look authentically older. So, he had to wear gray contacts, in order to look old.
      Along with Warren Beatty, Clint Eastwood, Robert Redford, Richard Attenborough and Kevin Costner one of 6 people to win and Academy Award for "Best Director", though they are mainly known as actors.

      Was offered the role of Eliot Ness in The Untouchables (1987), but had to decline because he was already working on one of the Lethal Weapon films.
      He turned down the role of Harvey Dent/Two Face in Batman Forever (1995), due to scheduling conflicts with Braveheart (1995).
      When Apocalypto (2006) is finished, he plans to donate six replicas of Mayan pyramids and several movie-set villages.
      In early December 2004, he flew to Fiji, where he bought the 2,160 hectare island of Mago from a Japanese hotel chain for $15 million. He plans to turn the Pacific paradise, which is home to forty residents (mostly coconut farmers and their families) into his own personal retreat. The South Pacific island boasts two lagoons and stunning white-sand beaches. The sale was finalized in March 2005.
      Gibson has been widely perceived as a conservative Republican, even though he has never identified himself as such. In March 2004 he expressed doubts over the Iraq war, in particular the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, although he maintained that President George W. Bush had "done a lot of good" elsewhere. At the People's Choice Awards ceremony in January 2005, Gibson again condemned the Iraq war and praised the liberal director Michael Moore and his documentary film Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004). Many of Gibson's positions are in accordance with traditional Catholicism. He released a statement in March 2005 condemning the euthanasia of Terri Schiavo, and has criticized stem cell research.
      He was the original choice to play Jack Stanton in Primary Colors (1998) but lost out to John Travolta.
      He was named after the Church of St. Mel in Clonmel, Co. Tipperary, Ireland where his mother's family is from.
      Was spoofed in both South Park (1997) and Family Guy (1999), and both of the times he was spoofed, there was a reference to the Looney Tunes cartoons. In the South Park (1997) episode "The Passion of the Jew", his character acts a lot like Daffy Duck in the cartoon Yankee Doodle Daffy (1943), while scaring Stan and Kenny, in the hopes that they will both torture him. And in the Family Guy (1999) episode "North by North Quahog", he chases Peter and Lois Griffin to the top of Mount Rushmore and is tricked into walking off a ledge, to which he plummets to the ground, very much like Wile E. Coyote does in several cartoons.
      He and his wife Robyn filed for divorce in April 2009. They had already been separated since August 2006.
      His performance as "Mad" Max Rockatansky in the "Mad Max" trilogy is ranked #78 on Premiere Magazine's 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.
Braveheart (1995) is ranked #62 on the American Film Institute's 100 Most Inspiring Movies of All Time.

Gibson's appearance marked his first public appearance since his DUI arrest on 28 July in Malibu.
      Director Martin Scorsese sent him the script for The Departed (2006), offering him the role of Ellerby. Gibson was unable to accept the role as he was starting production on Apocalypto (2006) that same year. Alec Baldwin later took the role.
Oliver Stone has tried casting him twice. Once as Jim Garrison in JFK (1991), and another time as Sgt. John McLoughlin in World Trade Center (2006).
      A chain smoker for most of his career, in 2004 Gibson's wife persuaded him to limit his addiction to just three cigarettes a day. However this did not last.
      On 27 January 1997, nine lesbian and gay filmmakers met with Gibson on the set of Conspiracy Theory (1997). Conceived and sponsored by GLAAD, the day long event gave the filmmakers the opportunity to meet with director Richard Donner, producer Joel Silver, and co-stars Patrick Stewart and Julia Roberts. A 40-minute lunch with Gibson, however, found the filmmakers not only discussing the inner workings of the industry but also Gibson's troubled relationship with the lesbian and gay community.
      Endorsed the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor of California in the 2006 mid-term elections.
      In interviews promoting The Passion of the Christ (2004), Gibson admitted that depression had led him to contemplate suicide, and that he made the film to "heal" himself.
      Along with Rolf Harris and Clive James, Gibson publicly supported keeping Queen Elizabeth II as head of state in an Australian poll in 1999.
      Voted the most powerful Christian in Hollywood in a poll by religious website Beliefnet.com in October 2007.

      He and Oksana Grigorieva became the parents of a girl, Lucia, on October 30, 2009, in Los Angeles.
      Turned down the chance to voice a parody of himself in the Family Guy (1999) episode "North by North-Quohag". He later admitted in an interview that he regretted the decision because he thought the episode was hilarious.

      His mother was born in County Longford, Ireland. His father was born in New York, of mostly Irish, as well as English, Scottish, and Welsh ancestry.
      I like directing much better. It's more fun, that's all there is to it. It's essentially the same job, which is storytelling, but you have more control over the way you want to tell the story. It's a high. I love it.
      My fears: everything from being afraid that I'm going to run out of cream for my cornflakes right up to someone chopping my privates off.
      On his involvement in Braveheart (1995) as actor, director and producer: "If you're going to wear three hats, you'd better grow two more heads."
      There is no salvation for those outside the Church...I believe it. Put it this way. My wife is a saint. She's a much better person than I am. Honestly. She's like, Episcopalian, Church of England. She prays, she believes in God, she knows Jesus, she believes in that stuff. And it's just not fair if she doesn't make it, she's better than I am. But that is a pronouncement from the chair. I go with it.
      On his religious beliefs: "I'm not a done deal. I'm a work in progress. I'm still extremely flawed."
      You can't live up to what people expect. Nobody can. But I guess that's my problem, not theirs.
      About the The Passion of the Christ (2004): This movie is about faith, hope, love and forgiveness. Themes that are as important now as they were in Jesus' time.
      I wasn't exactly the most zealous keeper-of-the-flame, you know? I was a pretty wild boy quite frankly. Even now when I'm trying more than I was before, I still fail every day at some level, but that's being human.
      I'd like to be able to wake up early every morning, but I don't. I'd like to quit smoking. I'd like to never lose my temper. The list goes on and on. I'd even like to get dressed by myself, and not have other people watching me.
      On human embryonic stem cell research: "I found that the cloning of human embryos will be used in the process and that, for me, I have an ethical problem with that. Why do I, as a taxpayer, have to fund something I believe is unethical?"
      The fear mongering we depict in this film reminds me a little of President Bush and his guys. [on Apocalypto (2006)]
      I feel a strange kinship with Michael [Moore]. They're trying to pit us against each other in the press, but it's a hologram. They really have got nothing to do with one another. It's just some kind of device, some left-right. He makes some salient points. There was some very expert, elliptical editing going on. However, what the hell are we doing in Iraq? No one can explain to me in a reasonable manner that I can accept why we're there, why we went there, and why we're still there.
      On his decision to cut a scene in which Caiaphas says "his blood be on us and on our children" soon Pontius Pilate washes his hands of Jesus: "I wanted it in. My brother said I was wimping out if I didn't include it. But, man, if I included that in there, they'd be coming after me at my house. They'd come to kill me."
      Asked whether The Passion of the Christ (2004) would be offensive to Jews today: "It's not meant to. I think it's meant to just tell the truth. I want to be as truthful as possible. But when you look at the reasons Christ came, he was crucified - he died for all mankind and he suffered for all mankind. So that, really, anyone who transgresses has to look at their own part or look at their own culpability."
      Vatican II corrupted the institution of the church. Look at the main fruits: dwindling numbers and pedophilia. - Time, January 27, 2003.
      I might go and go somewhere no-one can find me. You know where that is? You know where the place is no-one can find you? I was thinking of pitching my tent right next to the weapons of mass destruction. Then no-one would find me.
      I got to a very desperate place. Very desperate. Kind of jump-out-of-a-window kind of desperate. And I didn't want to hang around here, but I didn't want to check out. The other side was kind of scary. And I don't like heights, anyway. But when you get to that point where you don't want to live, and you don't want to die, it's a desperate, horrible place to be. And I just hit my knees. And I had to use The Passion of the Christ (2004) to heal my wounds.
      Asked whether his opposition to abortion and support for capital punishment makes him feel isolated in Hollywood: "Some kind of a dinosaur? No, you know you have to have these opinions about these things. I'm pretty firm on stuff like that. I don't feel like I'm howling in a hurricane. I just try to do my bit the way I think it should be done."
      "I probably sound like some egotist, you know, saying that the Roman Church is wrong, but I believe it is at the moment, since Vatican II." (1990)
      Opposition to The Passion of the Christ (2004) kind of put me back on my heels a little bit ... I expected some level of turbulence because when one delves into religion and politics - people's deeply held beliefs -- you're going to stir things up ... But it was a surprise to have shots being fired over the bow while I was still filming, and then to have various loud voices in the press - people who hadn't seen the work - really slinging mud.
      Asked if he felt besieged by the opposition to The Passion of the Christ (2004): Beseiged? No, not really. They're pretty pathetic actually. I sort of look at them now and feel sorry for them. They've given their best shot, they kind of came out with this mantra again and again and again, 'He's an anti-Semite, he's an anti-Semite, he's an anti-Semite, he's an anti-Semite.' I'm not. But they like to say that in newspapers. So it's kind of how those, anything repeated often enough slowly amalgamates into some sort of accepted truth.
      Obviously, nobody wants to touch something filmed in two dead languages. They think I'm crazy, and maybe I am. But maybe I'm a genius.
      There's something to do with the Federal Reserve that Lincoln did, Kennedy did and Reagan tried. I can't remember what it was. My dad told me about it. Everyone who did this particular thing that would have fixed the economy got undone. Anyway, I'll end up dead if I keep talking.
      My biggest weakness is that I'm excessive. Fortunately for everyone concerned, I'm not as excessive as I used to be.
      I think the Lethal Weapon movies contain my favorite performances. It sounds really crummy, I know, but although the work doesn't look hard, it's difficult to create effortless on screen.
      What worries me is that people will take this as fact. I'm not angry, per se, that it refutes everything I hold sacred, the foundations of my beliefs. The Da Vinci Code (2006) is an admitted work of fiction but it cleverly weaves fact into maverick theories in a way that will appear plausible to some.
      To be certain, neither I nor my film is anti-Semitic. The Passion is a movie meant to inspire, not offend. My intention in bringing it to the screen is to create a lasting work of art and engender serious thought among audiences of diverse faith backgrounds, or none, who have varying familiarity with this story. If the intense scrutiny during my twenty-five years in public life revealed I had ever persecuted or discriminated against anyone based on race or creed, I would be all too willing to make amends. But there is no such record. Nor do I hate anybody - certainly not the Jews ... They are my friends and associates, both in my work and social life. Thankfully, treasured friendships forged over decades are not easily shaken by nasty innuendo. Anti-Semitism is not only contrary to my personal beliefs, it is also contrary to the core message of my movie ... For those concerned about the content of this film, know that it conforms to the narratives of Christ's passion and death found in the four Gospels of the New Testament ... This is a movie about faith, hope, love and forgiveness - something sorely needed in these turbulent times.
      I'm not a preacher, and I'm not a pastor. But I really feel my career was leading me to make The Passion of the Christ (2004). The Holy Ghost was working through me on this film, and I was just directing traffic. I hope the film has the power to evangelize.
      [on his drunk driving relapse]: "I acted like a person completely out of control when I was arrested and said things that I do not believe to be true and which are despicable. The arresting officer was just doing his job and I feel fortunate that I was apprehended before I caused injury to any other person. I disgraced myself and my family with my behavior and for that I am truly sorry. I have battled with the disease of alcoholism for all of my adult life and profoundly regret my horrific relapse."
      Hollywood is a factory. You have to realize that you are working in a factory and you're part of the mechanism. If you break down, you'll be replaced.
      The precursors to a civilization that's going under are the same, time and time again. What's human sacrifice if not sending guys off to Iraq for no reason?
      I'll always continue to work. I've never much depended on anyone but myself, as far as that goes. And, hey, I'm not under the illusion that everything's just going to be hunky-dory work-wise forever. I've never been under that illusion. Things could go away tomorrow.
      I was subjected to a pretty brutal public beating. The film came out and, you could have heard a pin drop. Not even the crickets weren't chirping. But the other thing I never heard was one single word of apology. I thought I dealt with that stuff. But the human heart can bear the scars of resentment, and it will come out when you're overwrought and you take a few drinks. - On the hostile critical response to The Passion of the Christ (2004).
      My dad taught me my faith. I believe what he taught me. The man never lied to me in his life. People said, 'Well, he's just an old kook.' He's not an old kook. He's very intelligent. He's in complete possession of all his mental faculties. And if he says something he has a reason why he says it and he can back it up. Mensa wanted this guy, okay? He's very intelligent.
      They're not blameless in the Mideast conflict. Now when you're loaded the balance of how you see things comes out the wrong way. Let me be real clear, here. In sobriety here, in front of you, national television ... that I don't believe that Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world. I mean, that's an outrageous, drunken statement.
      "Film-making is what I love now. I don't want to be the star of a movie anymore." (December 2006)
      I felt like sending Michael Richards a note. I feel really badly for the guy. He was obviously in a state of stress. You don't need to be inebriated to be bent out of shape. But my heart went out to the guy. They'll probably torture him for a while and then let him go. I like him.
      [In response to winning more Oscars after his first]: "It's a wonderful feeling, but I'm not gonna kill myself trying to win another one."
      I've been chased by automobiles doing dangerous things on the freeway. People have tried to spit on me. It's made me totally paranoid. One day a gay group confronted me. They had signs, they were screaming and frothing at the mouth - pure hatred. It was wild. - After making apparently homophobic remarks in a 1992 interview with a Spanish magazine.
      Everyone always presumes I'm a Republican. I'm not. I couldn't vote for either one of those guys in the last election. I looked at the pair of them and was like, 'What do you want to do - get punched or get kicked?' It was a terrible choice to have to make. So I found somebody else on the ballot who was an independent who I liked the sound of. I can't even remember his name.
      I am politically incorrect, that's true. Political correctness to me is just intellectual terrorism. I find that really scary, and I won't be intimidated into changing my mind. Everyone isn't going to love you all the time.
      I shouldn't have said it, but I was tickling a bit of vodka during that interview, and the quote came back to bite me on the ass. - On his controversial 1992 interview with a Spanish magazine.
      I had really good highs but some very low lows. I found out recently I'm manic depressive. (2002)
      It's a hard game and everybody gets knifed at some point. But what's become really clear to me is that it's not rocket science at the end of the day. I wish I had that youthful spring in my step I once had, but hopefully, in some ways, I'm a lot better as far as maturity goes. (2009)
      Some people said that in telling the story we messed up history. It doesn't bother me because what I'm giving you is a cinematic experience, and I think films are there first to entertain, then teach, then inspire. There probably were historical inaccuracies - quite a few. But maybe there weren't, who's to say, because there was very little history about the man. It wasn't necessarily authentic. In some of the stuff I read about him, he wasn't as nice as he was on film. We romanticised it a bit, but that's the language of film - you have to make it cinematically acceptable. Actually, he was a monster - he always smelled of smoke because he was always burning people's villages down. He was like what the Vikings called a 'berserker'. But we kind of shifted the balance a bit because somebody's got to be the good guy and somebody the bad guy, and every story has its own point of view. That was our bias. - On Braveheart (1995).
      William Wallace was around 28 when he died and I was already ten years older than that, although at least my knees weren't wrinkly!
      When all's said and done, I did a pretty good hatchet job on my marriage. I'm to blame, if you're inclined to judge.
      Nobody is without sin. You have to try to make amends if you can. You have to shut up and move on and not whine about it. And you have to deal with it like a man. You've just got to accept your own culpability.
      I feel sorry for Tiger Woods. Why are we talking about this when we're sending 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan? He's being used as a diversion, and it just drives me crazy.
      I have aged. It's just a natural part of the holy human condition. What am I going to do? Get surgery? That just looks weird. Besides, that must hurt, so what's the point? I think I'm a lot better because maturity brings things out. I just wish I had that youthful spring again. But it's a trade-off, right?
      I did have bodyguards for a little while but it's a drag. If your number's up, its up. If I'm lying in bed and somebody comes into my room, I'll either wake up or I won't. And I'll either hit 'em with my big stick that I've got or my gun that I have stowed away... or they'll hit me. Look, in this day and age, you've got to be tooled up.
      I try and eat right but I don't work out much. I quit smoking so that's something in the right direction. I just don't do anything fun anymore. But that's dying, isn't it? You die in stages. You let things go in pieces. It's more than halfway through, right? Life's experiences, whether they be pleasant, unpleasant, torturous or excruciatingly wonderful and blissful, season you somehow and hopefully you learn from them. Isn't that what it's about?
      [on his return to acting after 8 years with Edge of Darkness (2010)] I think any kind of hiatus one takes in an artistic journey is going to make a huge difference. The pause will inform the choices that you make. I kind of felt I was getting stale so being away for a while has been good.
      [on his infamous anti-semitic rant to police in 2006] It's said that I went into a rant, but I think it went on for about five words. I was drunk. It just turned into a big thing. I apologized profusely -- not once but three times. So what's the problem? It's four years ago. Do I need to apologize again?
Barack Obama is a man with an impossible task on his hands. He got left a mess and I wish him all the best but I don't think he's going to fix it in five minutes and probably not in his entire tenure.
      [on why he temporarily quit acting after Signs (2002)] I felt ham-fisted. M. Night Shyamalan told me I was just doing too much. I looked around and I was the oldest guy on the set and I felt like the least sophisticated. I decided I needed to rethink everything. I got into this because I wanted to be good. I walked away because I don't know that I was bringing much new to anything. Another seven or eight years of living informs the choices one makes.
      You ask anybody what their number one fear is and it's public humiliation. Multiply that on a global scale and that's what I've been through. It changes you. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. It's really that simple. You can't do anything but live in the moment and leave the future in the hands of providence and don't regret the past too much. Maybe just take a lesson from it.
      Feminists don't like me, and I don't like them. I don't get their point. I don't know why feminists have it out for me, but that's their problem, not mine.
      I've never treated anyone badly or in a discriminatory way based on their gender, race, religion, or sexuality - period. I don't blame some people for thinking that though, from the garbage they heard on those leaked tapes, which have been edited. You have to put it all in the proper context of being in an irrationally, heated discussion at the height of a breakdown, trying to get out of a really unhealthy relationship. It's one terribly, awful moment in time, said to one person, in the span of one day and doesn't represent what I truly believe or how I've treated people my entire life.
      Depression is like that. It's somewhere one can be caught. You can get stuck there. Initially, it does stem from a certain amount of egotism. What does it do to everyone around in the family? It is an illness. It is a disease. And, I think there is a better understanding of it. A guy said to me one time, something really profound, and it's so simple. It's that depression lies. It's a liar and you have to shut it down. There is nothing that alleviates it more than going out and doing something for someone else. It's almost like instant healing. Get away from yourself. People can't even get out of bed and it gets really severe. I've never been at that stage. Everyone goes through low and high and low and high and some people are blessed to be created on an even keel all the way through - but not me.
      [on Jodie Foster] You couldn't get two people who are more diametrically opposed on everything that they think about religion and politics than we do. But there's a core of goodness there that's undeniable, and I just love her.
      [on Steven Spielberg] The first film of Steven's I saw was Duel (1971). It was amazing. I was 19 and I went to see it and it was really, really compelling. And then there were all these stories: "The guy made it for no money!" I'm like, "Wow, that's kind of brilliant." And it was really brilliant. He's a master - so many great films. One of the best he made, people hardly recognized him for it: Empire of the Sun (1987). Phenomenal movie! The thing that bothered me about that was it seemed like nobody noticed, but it was this masterpiece! [2009]
=======================================================
Born to Hutton Gibson and Anne Reilly Gibson, Mel is the sixth of eleven children. In 1968, when Gibson was 12-years-old, the family emigrated to Sydney, Australia.
His father had won $21,000 as a contestant on international game show ‘Jeopardy’ and had also received $145,000 compensation for a 1964 work accident that had caused him to lose his job as brakeman for New York City Railroad.
It was an opportunity for Hutton to get his sons away from the cultural changes of 1960s America, which he felt were immoral. He chose Australia, as it was his wife’s homeland, her mother having been an opera singer who had emigrated to the US years before, and she had extended family living there. Gibson kept his American citizenship and acquired an Australian accent.
Gibson attended school at St Leo’s College, run by Christian Brothers but constantly rebelled against their rules. His exasperated father eventually moved him to Asquith High state school, where he settled in to become a typical Aussie teenager. Gibson had no particular vocational yearning, thinking perhaps he may become a priest at one stage and then considering journalism. Extremely shy, he dated little, and usually took his friends along for moral support. He did however enjoy elaborately staged practical jokes and was an excellent mimic, having a penchant for different accents.
It was these skills that made his sister apply, on his behalf but without his knowledge, to the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney. At the time, Gibson had graduated from school and was working at an orange juice-bottling factory. When he was offered a place to study acting at the Institute of Dramatic Art, he gladly accepted, moving out of his parents’ home and in with three of his friends, one of whom was Geoffrey Rush (now an Oscar winning actor). He overcame his stage fright (a result of his shyness) and put all his effort into the course, thoroughly enjoying the theatrical work. Gibson graduated in 1977 and began working on the small screen, appearing in television series ‘The Sullivans’ (1976-1983), ‘Cop Shop’ (1977-1984) and ‘Punishment’ (1981).
However, he hated television work as compared to the theatre, maintaining that good acting was only done within time constraints. He joined the South Australia Theatre Company and toured with ‘Waiting for Godot’. It was during this tour, whilst in Adelaide, that he met his future wife, Robyn Moore, who was working as a dental nurse. They were married on 7 June 1980 and went on to have seven children, first a daughter Hannah (b. 1980) and then six sons, twins Edward and Christian (b. 1982), Willie (b. 1985), Louis (b. 1988), Milo (b. 1990) and Tommy (b. 1999).
Gibson’s first big screen debut came in the form of an uncredited role as a baseball player in ‘I Never Promised You a Rose Garden’ (1977). However, it wasn’t long before he met director Phil Avalon and was cast in his low-budget surfer movie called ‘Summer City’ (1977), enjoying a brief relationship with co-star Deborah Foreman.
Two years later, Gibson was offered the lead role in George Miller’s sensational ‘Mad Max’ (1979). In a strange twist of fate, on the night before the audition Gibson was involved in a boozy fight, which left him with stitches in his head and a badly bruised and beaten face. It was the last thing he needed when trying to impress a casting crew, but it was in fact this ‘look’ that clinched the deal. In a role that secured his arrival as a star, Gibson played ‘Mad’ Max Rockatansky, a ruthless, leather-clad survivor in the savage post-apocalyptic Australian Outback. The film became a cult hit that has since been followed by sequels.
Playing the title role in ‘Tim’ (1979) won Gibson his first Best Actor in a Lead Role Award from The Australian Film Institute and playing Frank Dunne in Peter Weir’s WW1 drama ‘Gallipoli’ (1981) won him his second. Not only was Gibson gaining big screen experience, his acting efforts were being noticed and rewarded, at least in Australia. With his offbeat charm, his magnetism, his piercingly blue eyes and his boyish good looks, he was becoming an obvious choice for male lead roles.
‘Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior’ (1981) was another runaway hit and finally made a star of Gibson in America. To follow were two more war dramas, the mediocre ‘Attack Force Z’ (1982) and the ‘The Year of Living Dangerously’ (1982) with Sigourney Weaver. He starred as Fletcher Christian with Anthony Hopkins, Laurence Olivier, Daniel Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson in ‘The Bounty’ (1984). At this stage, Gibson was already struggling with alcoholism, finding that the inebriation took away his shyness and that he generally drank a whole lot more when he was away from his family, when filming. This caused an on-set rift between himself and Hopkins, a teetotaller at the time. In fact, in Toronto 1984, an inebriated Gibson rear-ended another driver. He pleaded guilty to drunk driving and was fined $300.
Gibson then worked on his first film with an American director and for the first time, adopted an American accent. It was New Yorker Mark Rydell’s epic love story ‘The River’ (1984), in which Gibson starred opposite Sissy Spaceck. He played prisoner Ed Biddle, with Diane Keaton and Matthew Modine, in the romantic drama ‘Mrs Soffel’ (1984) before returning once more to Australia and his Mad Max role, to film the third in the series. It was ‘Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome’ (1985) with Tina Turner as Aunty Entity.
Unbeknownst to Gibson, he was about to become one of the biggest action heroes of all time. Upon his return to America, he was offered the role of Sergeant Martin Riggs in the ‘Lethal Weapon’ series. His partner in this “buddy film” genre was Danny Glover, with whom he shared great onscreen chemistry, helping the series that has spanned almost two decades, to become enormously successful. Between ‘Lethal Weapon’ (1987) and ‘Lethal Weapon 2’ (1989), Gibson starred in the action romance ‘Tequila Sunrise’ (1988) with Michele Pfeiffer and Kurt Russell. Then came adventure comedy ‘Bird on a Wire’ (1990) with David Carradine and the delightful Goldie Hawn, and action comedy ‘Air America’ (1990) with Robert Downey Jr, about the Vietnam War.
In an unusual switch of genres, from action to classical, Gibson played the Danish Prince in Franco Zeffirelli’s ‘Hamlet’ (1990) with co-stars Glenn Close, Alan Bates and Paul Schofield, and certainly held his own. During the filming of ‘Hamlet’, chain-smoking Gibson changed to nicotine gum in an effort to better control his breathing, for the improved delivery of his lines. In 1991 he began treatment for alcoholism, with his wife threatening to leave him if he refused. He then starred with Elijah Wood and Jamie Lee Curtis in ‘Forever Young’ (1992) for which he was also Executive Producer but this role went uncredited. ‘Lethal Weapon 3’ (1992) scored its by-now-usual box-office hit and Gibson made his directorial debut with ‘The Man Without a Face’ (1993). In this heart-warming drama he starred as Justin McLeod. Next was his role as the gambling Bret Maverick Jr in ‘Maverick’ (1994), with charming lady thief played by Jodie Foster.
The unforgettable historical epic ‘Braveheart’ (1995) was Gibson’s second opportunity as Director, in which he played the lead role of 13th century Scottish rebel and hero William Wallace. The film was signed by Icon Productions, a company co-owned by Gibson and Bruce Davey, and Gibson achieved invigorating performances, brutal battle scenes and touching story telling. In short, with very little prior experience at Directing, Gibson surpassed everyone’s expectations by winning two Oscars at the 1996 Academy Awards, for Best Picture and Best Director, as well as a 1996 Golden Globe Award for Best Director. Also released in 1995 was Disney’s animated movie ‘Pocahontas’ for which Gibson provided the voice of John Smith, proving his singing abilities.
‘Ransom’ (1996) was a fast-paced kidnap story that had Gibson playing rich airline owner Tom Mullen, with Rene Russo and Gary Sinese. Julia Roberts starred with Gibson in romantic thriller ‘Conspiracy Theory’ (1997). Also that year were two uncredited cameo roles, as Scott the Body Piercer in ‘Fathers' Day’ (1997) and as Frances’ father in ‘FairyTale: A True Story’ (1997). In 1997, he was awarded the Officer of the Order of Australia, the country’s highest honour. Then came ‘Lethal Weapon 4’ (1998) and the next year, Gibson provided the voice for one episode of the cult television series ‘The Simpsons’ (1999). He played Porter in ‘Payback’ (1999), a remake of the 1968 crime thriller that starred Lee Marvin and Angie Dickinson.
Wim Wenders directed ‘The Million Dollar Hotel’ (2000) in which Gibson played FBI agent Detective Skinner alongside Milla Jovovich and Jeremy Davies. He then provided the voice of Rocky Rhodes the Rhode Island Red Rooster in the much loved animated film ‘Chicken Run’ (2000). ‘The Patriot’ (2000) was a slightly sentimental take on the American revolutionary war and then Gibson played a chauvinistic executive who, after an accident, is able to hear what women are thinking in ‘What Women Want’ (2000) with Helen Hunt, Marissa Tomei, Alan Alda and Bette Midler.
Gibson played Lt. Col. Hal Moore opposite Madeleine Stowe as Julie Moore in ‘We Were Soldiers’ (2002), a true story about the Vietnam War. In ‘Signs’ (2002) he was the Reverend Graham Hess and Joaquin Phoenix played his brother, Merrill Hess, in a story involving crop circles, car accidents and tests of faith. Gibson won a Global Achievement Award from the Australian Film Institute in 2002 in recognition of his contribution to acting. ‘The Singing Detective’ (2003), in which Gibson played a psychotherapist with Robert Downey Jr, Robin Wright Penn and Katie Holmes, topped the box office charts and was America’s biggest summer hit of 2003.
In ‘Paparazzi’ (2004), which he produced, Gibson played an uncredited role as an Anger Management Therapy patient. He admitted to drug and alcohol abuse in a 2004 Primetime interview with Diane Sawyer. Gibson committed himself to rehabilitation, having reached a low point of depression and guilt surrounding his behaviour and having even considered suicide. The need to reconnect with his spiritual side and his own strongly religious upbringing inspired him to direct and produce the film ‘The Passion of the Christ’ (2004). It had been ten years in the research and making and Gibson reportedly spent $25 million of his own money on the project. The blockbuster, created by Icon Productions, the production company co-owned by Gibson and Bruce Davey, was surrounded by controversy before the film was even released. Not since Martin Scorsese’s ‘The Last Temptation of Christ’ (1988) had a religious movie caused such a stir.
Gibson’s father was accused of having denied the Holocaust, to which Gibson replied that his father had been questioning the number of Jewish deaths rather than having denied it ever happened. Jewish pressure groups such as the Anti-Defamation League and the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, responded immediately. Not to be left out, a group of Catholic ecumenists, activists and scholars compiled a list of transgressions in the script and demanded that the film be entirely remade. Some people in Hollywood even turned against Gibson during this difficult time. Determined to see his dream to fruition, he held his ground, even daring to have his actors speak entirely in Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin (although it was all subtitled).
The film told the story of the last hours of Christ in harrowing detail, vividly portraying his violent beatings and humiliation and made for intensely disturbing viewing. The Catholic Church distanced itself from the entire issue, which meant the film remained uncensored. Despite all the controversy, Gibson’s instincts had been correct and the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Original Music Score, Best Cinematography and Best Makeup and won the People’s Choice Award for Best Drama. ‘The Passion of the Christ’ (2004) became the highest grossing R-rated film in American history and the 8th highest grossing movie of all time.
Inspired by this success, Gibson went on to direct the epic ‘Apocalypto’ and was also Executive Producer, Producer and Writer. The title is Greek for “new beginning” or “unveiling”. The film is set during the time of the decline of the Mayan civilization 600 years ago. As in ‘The Passion of the Christ’ (2004), Gibson used local dialect - in this case, Yucatec Maya – and unknown actors. Once again this was self-financed by Gibson, with Icon Productions retaining the international rights whilst Disney will distribute the film in the US.
The man who began his career being typecast as an action hero but who soon proved his great versatility as an actor, is certainly not slowing down after nearly three decades in the business. There is talk of the release of the fourth Mad Max movie, which is in the pre-production stage, with the working title of ‘Mad Max: Fury Road’. ‘Sam and George’, a drama directed by Richard Donner, is due for release in 2008. In the story about old friends reuniting, Gibson plays a man released from prison after serving twenty years for a crime he did not commit.
This award winning actor, director and producer is actually a fiercely private man who genuinely loves his wife and children. He and his wife donate to various charities, particularly those helping needy children around the world. His company, Icon Productions now has offices worldwide and produces international films and television shows. Brought up by strictly Catholic parents, Gibson spent years of drinking, smoking, brawling, gambling and womanising before battling his addictions and the controversy surrounding his personal views and behaviour. He has, at times, voiced prejudiced, anti-Semitic and homophobic statements and been fined more than once for driving misdemeanours involving alcohol, yet he always manages to recover from these incidents.
On 28th July 2006 Gibson fell foul of the law in a return to his old drinking habits. After being pulled over for speeding and drunk driving on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, he swore and made a number of sexist and anti-Semitic statements, one of which was, “F***ing Jews… Jews are responsible for all wars in the world.” He was arrested and charged with DUI (Driving Under the Influence) with a blood alcohol level above California’s 0.08 legal limit. He was also cited for a vehicle code infraction for having an open bottle of Tequila in his car when he was stopped. The following day, he issued two formal apologies for his behaviour and his comments upon being arrested, specifically apologising to the Jewish community in the second one. On 17th August 2006, he pleaded guilty to his charges and was sentenced to three years on probation, his licence was restricted for 90 days and he was fined $1 300. The Superior Court Judge also ordered Gibson to attend regular Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and to enter a rehabilitation programme.
With such talent and potential to keep achieving in the world of entertainment, here’s hoping Gibson manages to conquer his addictions once and for all and that his desire to become more spiritual will help him through the process and eradicate the controversy that often clouds an otherwise bright and ambitious character.
After 26 years of marriage, Mel and Robyn Gibson separated on 29 July 2006. In a 2011 interview, Gibson revealed that the separation occurred the day after his drunk driving arrest.In a joint statement, the couple said: "Throughout our marriage and separation we have always strived to maintain the privacy and integrity of our family and will continue to do so."Robyn cited irreconcilable differences and filed for divorce on 13 April 2009 after the publication of Mel embracing Russian pianist Oksana Grigorieva on a beach.The divorce was finalised on 23 December 2011, with the settlement reaching $400,000,000 - one of the largest in Hollywood history.Gibson made his first red carpet appearance with Grigorieva on 28 April 2009 and she gave birth to their daughter Lucia on 30 October 2009. In April 2010, it was revealed the pair had split and each party took out a restraining order on the other.He returned to film in 'The Edge of Darkness' as a homicide detective investigating his daughter's death in 2010.Gibson starred alongside Jodie Foster, who also directed 'The Beaver' in 2011 as a troubled husband and executive who adopts a beaver hand puppet as his sole mean of communication.In 2012, Gibson will star in 'Get the Gringo' playing a career criminal placed in a tough prison by Mexican officials for nine years. He also wrote the screenplay.
=======================================================
Way before Russell, Cate and Hugh Jackman, even before Geoffrey Rush and Sam Neill, the Antipodes could boast of a mega-star in the Hollywood firmament. One of the brightest, in fact. Mel Gibson was without doubt one of the biggest action heroes of the Eighties and Nineties. Furthermore, when he decided to produce, direct and star in his own action movie, Braveheart, he even snapped up a couple of Oscars - a very, very rare occurrence in the genre. Following this with his self-financed mega-hit The Passion Of The Christ and the epic Apocalypto, he even looked set to out-do Clint Eastwood and become the most successful actor-turned-director of modern times.Yet Mel Columcille Gerard Gibson isn't, strictly speaking, Australian at all. He was born on the 3rd of January, 1956, in Peekskill, New York, the sixth of eleven children. His father, Hutton, was a brakeman for New York Central Railroad and, considering New York City no place to raise children, moved the family north to Croton-on-Hudson, then on to nearby Verplanck Point and, by 1961, on to a farmhouse at Mount Vision. Times were hard and Hutton figured he'd run the farm and do his rail job too. So he spent weekdays in New York City while the family (isolated by mother Anne's inability to drive) stuck out on the farm. It was tough, but a great place to be a kid.In 1964, disaster struck when Hutton suffered a serious work accident and lost his job. The Gibsons were forced to move into cheap rented accommodation, with the older children having to take jobs, while Hutton entered into a compensation battle with the company. It would take three years to work out. When it did, though, it worked out well. Hutton was a strict and traditional Catholic - having at one point studied for the priesthood - and did not really approve of the cultural changes in the Sixties, regarding the hippies' penchant for mind-expansion and promiscuity as a sad sign of moral decline. Consequently, when he won $145,000 compensation, and a further $21,000 from the Jeopardy! gameshow (very bright, the Gibsons), he decided to take the family to Australia, Anne's homeland (her mother had been an opera singer who'd emigrated to the States).It's been said that the Gibsons moved to escape the draft for Vietnam. Not true. Hutton had served in WW2 and truly despised war, but his sons could still have been drafted from Australia. Indeed, Mel's eldest brother WAS drafted, only to fail the initial tests. Also, Anne had an extended family there which would surely help as Hutton recovered from the accident.So, off they went, via Ireland, Scotland, England and Rome, where the kids were shown their Celtic heritage (Mel's the name of an Irish saint - and it's NOT Melvin) and spent time at the Vatican. They arrived in Australia in November of 1968 and settled in a suburb north of Sydney. Mel was sent to St Leo's College, run by the Christian Brothers, where he was picked on mercilessly for his accent. Rebelling against the repressive regime, he got "whacked around for smoking, fighting, not following their stupid rules". Eventually, Hutton pulled him out and sent him to a state school - Asquith High - where he became a proper Aussie bloke, drinking , brawling and the rest. He did date a little, but usually with his mates along, being extremely shy.. After school, he thought of the priesthood, then journalism, but he had no genuine vocation, ending up employed at an orange juice bottling plant in Sydney. His sister Sheila, though, was a big admirer of Mel's elaborately staged jokes, his talent for mimicry and his ability with accents - he had, after all, learned to speak 'Strine. So, she filled in an application form for him to join the National Institute of Dramatic Arts, at the University of New South Wales. Having tested the water (and some adventure) by taking a course at the New Zealand Drama School in Wellington, Mel went along to NIDA and, somehow, was accepted.It wasn't easy to begin with. Mel didn't take it seriously and so suffered the disapproval of students who did. He grew his hair and a beard and did all those Seventies things that have very little to do with disciplined work. He moved out of his parents' home to share a flat with three other guys. You can imagine...But, after a while, he began to make an effort, conquering the terrible stage fright that had seen him have to sit down during his first ever performance. Playing Romeo alongside fellow student Judy Davis, he was a real success. With his hair and beard removed, people began to take notice of his extraordinary good looks. He shared a flat with Geoffrey Rush and began to exhibit some of Rush's flair and enthusiasm for theatre.At the end of 1976, Mel and his student-buddy Steve Bisley (Bisley would appear, as Goose, in Mel's breakthrough hit Mad Max) met producer Phil Avalon and found themselves cast in the lightweight surfer movie Summer City. They were paid the union minimum of $400 but it was experience, and fun. Mel enjoyed a relationship with co-star Deborah Foreman who, once it was over, was reported to have attempted suicide at a boozy party. The movie was a success in one respect. Mel was taken on by agent Bill Shannahan, who scored him a part in The Sullivans. This was good exposure, but Mel hated TV work, believing time constraints meant little genuinely good work was done. To learn his craft, he joined the South Australia Theatre Company and toured with Waiting For Godot. When renting a room in Adelaide, he entered the kitchen one day to find a pretty young woman, a dental assistant named Robyn Moore, making breakfast. She had a boyfriend then but, by June of 1980 she and Mel would be married, now having seven children.Now Shannahan really came good. He got Mel an audition for the producer/director George Miller, then casting for a futuristic feast of ultraviolence called Mad Max. The night before, Mel got drunk at a party (as he often did) and became involved in a fight with three other men. They pounded him good and proper, and he showed up at the audition with stitches in his head, his nose all over the place and his jaw out of line. Incredibly, he was the perfect Max Rockatansky - possibly the most severely battered hero in screen history.The filming was hard. With a budget of just a few hundred thousand, the cast and crew all lived in the same house, and all helped out moving equipment. And it came off. Mel shone as a cop whose wife and kid are run down and killed by a fearsome motor-gang led by The Toecutter. This, as the title suggests, makes him mad, and he goes after them, giving his final victim the choice of either dying in an inferno or cutting his own foot off. Boosted by word-of-mouth rumours that it was exceptionally brutal - remember, this was Video Nasty time, when many films were benefiting from being banned - Mad Max was a sensation, taking over $100 million. Unfazed, Mel continued his stage education, appearing in Oedipus Rex and Henry IV. Always keen to expand his repertoire, he also starred in Tim, written by Colleen McCullough. Here he played a labourer of below-average intelligence who's befriended by older woman Piper Laurie. Choosing to highlight his character's innocence, rather than his disability, Gibson was charming and convincing, and won the Best Actor Award from the Australian Film Institute.Now came more stage-work, and then the war movie Attack Force Z, a bad experience. Mel was disappointed that director Philip Noyce (later to make Dead Calm and Patriot Games) had left the project and, like the rest of a cast including Sam Neil, was also annoyed at the star-treatment meted out to John Philip Law. After filming ended in Thailand, he returned to Australia and, now married and needing the money, took a part in the prison drama Punishment.Thank the Lord, matters quickly improved. Peter Weir, who'd helped re-generate the Aussie film industry with his marvellous Picnic At Hanging Rock, wanted Mel to star alongside newcomer Mark Lee in the war drama, Gallipoli. The pair would play young sprinters whose athletic careers are halted when they're sent into action in Turkey during WW1. The army uses their talents by having them race through the trenches with important messages, while the British commanders are foolishly and mercilessly sending troops over the top into unanswerable machine-gun fire. It was an extremely moving movie, and not the last time Mel would be involved in Brit-bashing. Both Braveheart and The Patriot would also portray the denizens of this sceptred isle, this earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, this other Eden - DEMI-PARADISE - as a gang of plummy-voiced butchers. He'd answer outraged complaints with a cute and funny "Hey, we're giving the Germans a break". In Australia, of course, it didn't matter. Gallipoli won Gibson a second Best Actor Award.. Next came another monster hit, as he returned to Mad Max. In The Road Warrior, we see Max years after the original killing and revenge, wandering the desolate landscape with a hound whose food he selfishly gobbles himself. No semblance of law remains and a community of nice people is under siege by a fantastically dangerous horde of punky marauders. Will Max help them escape with their fuel? Not a chance. At least not until - thanks to the marauders - all his bones are broken and his eyes are popping out of his head.Mad Max 2, undoubtedly one of the best and most exciting action films ever made, was another massive hit and made Gibson a star in America. But, rather than go down the action hero route (he'd turn down a part in The Running Man), he chose to play a reporter in Indonesia when revolution struck in 1965, in Peter Weir's The Year Of Living Dangerously. Here he had an onscreen affair with Sigourney Weaver (they had to raise his shoes for this, though Mel, at 5'9", is not short). Linda Hunt, as his crazy, tiny photographer, would win an Oscar. From here, Mel moved on to The Bounty, playing Fletcher Christian to Anthony Hopkins' Captain Bligh. The cast featured the cream of the British and Irish crop - Laurence Olivier, Edward Fox, Liam Neeson, Daniel Day-Lewis, plus stalwarts like Bernard Hill and Philip Davis and, further down the bill, John Sessions and Neil Morrissey. The movie was filmed on Moorea, an island near Tahiti, and the shoot was marked by some serious drinking sessions. When away from his family (the kids were coming regularly now), Mel would hit the sauce with abandon. It was reported that, on one occasion, he got into another bar brawl and was so badly bruised they had to change the order of shooting. A year or so later, he'd be charged with drinking and driving, receiving a three month ban and a $300 fine. Like many very shy people, Mel found life to be more fun and himself to be more gregarious after a few drinks. But it became a problem and, by the early Nineties, he'd entered a programme to sort himself out.After The Bounty came the first movie where Mel adopted an American accent, when he and Sissy Spacek battled to keep their farm in The River (Spacek would be Oscar-nominated). Then, once again trying to steer clear of action parts, he played a jailbird helped to escape by besotted warden's wife Diane Keaton in Mrs Soffel (helmed by Aussie director Gillian Armstrong). After this came Mad Max 3: Beyond Thunderdome, a fairly weak sequel that featured Tina Turner and, more interestingly, Angelo Rossitto - a dwarf from the brilliant Freaks - as The Master.Now came another monster, Lethal Weapon, the first of a series of four. This was a superior buddy movie, with Gibson playing maverick cop Martin Riggs, constantly taunting the more conservative partner, family man Danny Glover. But it wasn't JUST a buddy movie. One of the opening scenes, where Riggs has lost his wife and is contemplating suicide, saw Mel deliver a truly moving performance, excellent by anyone's standards. With the financial proceeds from his last two movies, Mel bought a 300-acre cattle ranch in the Kiewa Valley in northern Victoria, then a house in Malibu, so he wouldn't have to be away from his family so much, and the kids could stick to the same school.After Lethal Weapon came Tequila Sunrise, where Mel played a drug dealer pursued by an old friend, now a policeman (played by Kurt Russell), with the pair of them falling for restauranteuse Michelle Pfeiffer. Gibson and Russell would become great friends and Mel, who'd been seeking a strong comedy for some years, now made Bird On A Wire with Russell's wife, Goldie Hawn. Then came another war flick, Air America.With the Lethal Weapon franchise now in full swing, this was enough action for a while. Gibson turned down the lead in Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves (he also turned down the role of James Bond, TWICE - after Roger Moore had departed, and then after Timothy Dalton), and took on Shakespeare's finest, Hamlet. Directed by Franco Zeffirelli, and co-starring such heavyweights as Glenn Close, Alan Bates and Paul Schofield, the movie was a huge risk for Gibson. Some critics jeered, unable to accept that Mad Max might dare to follow in the footsteps of Olivier, but Gibson really was good, more than holding his own in terrifying company. And he kept on with his "interesting" projects. Next came the tear-jerking Forever Young, where he played a man frozen for fifty years, then woken up by Elijah Wood (later Frodo Baggins in The Lord Of The Rings). Then he played alongside another kid in Man Without A Face, where he played a horribly scarred recluse who becomes a young boy's mentor. Importantly, this was also Mel's first directing experience - the thoroughly unlikely practice run for Braveheart.Mel had formed a production company, called Icon, and had signed a $42 million, four-picture deal with Warners and got moving fast. Mel's love of opera (inherited from his gran, probably) and classical music led Icon to produce Immortal Beloved. Later, they'd make Anna Karenina, 187 and Fairy Tale: A Love Story, the last of which would see Mel turn up in the last shot as the little heroine's daddy, returned from the war. First, though, there was the Mel-starring Maverick, written by William Goldman and directed by Lethal Weapon's Richard Donner.But it was Icon's next production that made Mel undeniably the biggest star in Hollywood. Randall Wallace (later to write Mel's We Were Soldiers), sent a script to Icon concerning William Wallace, a Scottish hero who, partly for freedom's sake and partly due to the brutalizing of his wife, went to war with Edward I and nearly won. Mel, who'd always love epics like Spartacus, went for it. The wife angle was familiar too, with Gibson taking to calling his character Mad Mac. As said, aside from the infinitely smaller Man Without A Face, Gibson had little experience of directing, and none of directing on this scale - and he knew it. Filming in Ireland, he took to carrying around a book he'd had made, titled A Beginner's Guide To Directing The Epic. He had, though, done his homework, studying the battle sequences in Kubrick's Spartacus and Orson Welles' Chimes At Midnight. He knew what he wanted and, with the help of the Irish army reserve, serving as extras, he got it. Braveheart was a mighty achievement. Aided by great performances from Gibson, Angus Macfadyen as Robert The Bruce and especially from Patrick McGoohan as Edward Longshanks, it was invigorating, touching and tremendously brutal. The battle sequences were amongst the best ever filmed, and the story-telling was strong too. Gibson surprised everyone - for action films are not traditionally the Academy's favourites - by taking the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director.Turning down the role of another Brit icon, Steed in The Avengers, Gibson moved on to a string of huge hits. In Ransom he played a rich man taking all manner of crazy risks to rescue his kidnapped daughter. In Conspiracy Theory, co-starring Julia Roberts (who he kept sending dried rats) and directed once again by Richard Donner, he was a geek cabbie who gets drawn into a real CIA plot. Then, after Lethal Weapon 4, where Martin Riggs was unfortunately a parody of himself, there was the harsh and thrilling Payback, a remake of Lee Marvin's Point Blank with Gibson as Porter, calmly and coldly beating and threatening everyone till he gets his money back. Mel had every right to be a bit tetchy - he suffered appendicitis during the shoot and production was halted for a week while he was in hospital.After this came Wim Wenders' more arty The Million Dollar Hotel where Gibson played an FBI agent investigating the bizarre occupants of run-down hostelry. The movie was apparently based on the ideas of U2 singer Bono, his band having performed on top of the same hotel when filming the video for Where The Streets Have No Name. After this, Mel provided the voice of Rocky Rhodes The Rhode Island Red Rooster in the animation Chicken Run (he'd earlier provided the voice of John Smith in Disney's Pocahontas).Now came two more Big Ones. In The Patriot, as Colonel Benjamin "Ghost" Martin, he took on the English forces during the American revolutionary war. The movie was a tad sentimental and borrowed heavily from Michael Mann's superior Last Of The Mohicans. But audiences lapped it up, as they did Mel's next offering, What Women Want. Here he was ad exec Nick Marshall, a macho sexist who, having been electrocuted in the bath, can suddenly hear what women are thinking. This, of course, causes much hilarity, both in his "romantic" life and in his relationship with his teenage daughter who's plotting her first sexual experience. The movie made well over $300 million, and aside from winning him a Golden Globe nomination (he'd also received one for Ransom), it justified Mel's now incredible pay-packets. For The Patriot he received a then-groundbreaking $25 million. On he went to We Were Soldiers, the true story of a band of 400 elite US soldiers surrounded by 2000 North Vietnamese in one of the bloodiest conflicts of recent times. Like Saving Private Ryan, much of the movie was an extended battle sequence, but it was searingly effective, nonetheless. And there was also emotional weight added by Mel's relationship with his screen wife, the excellent Madeleine Stowe.After this, he took the lead in Signs, M. Night Shyamalan's follow-up to The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Here he played a Pennsylvania farmer and former priest, his faith destroyed by a terrible accident. As bizarre and frightening events began to occur all over the world, mysterious crop circles appeared in his fields and the suspense racked up as Shyamalan reinvented the modern terror-flick. It was another massive hit for Gibson, recouping a budget of $62 million in its first weekend, topping the box office charts and later returning to the top for another two weeks. Soon passing the $200 million barrier, it was America's biggest summer hit, even outdoing Goldmember.Gibson's next outing would be another fascinating piece - Keith Gordon's film adaptation of Dennis Potter's legendary TV series The Singing Detective. Here Robert Downey Jr would replace Michael Gambon as the pulp fiction writer driven to the verge of madness by psoriasis and living in a weird world of painful reality, hallucination and vengeful daydreams. Gibson, near unrecognisable in skullcap and thick-lensed glasses, would play his psychotherapist, attempting to understand his patient's bitter tongue and violent temper.This wild variation of roles might make one think Gibson was jaded with Hollywood life and seeking to interest himself as an actor. In fact, he was filling in time as he pursued perhaps the greatest project of his life. As said, the late Eighties had seen him falling off the rails. He'd been a womaniser and a heavy drinker, behaviour that, striking against his religious background, had racked him with guilt and, he'd later admit, even had him considering suicide. After rehab he'd sworn off the booze and, seeking to re-connect with his spiritual core, began work on a new cinematic adaptation of the final days of Jesus. Braveheart had convinced him that he was capable, his acting had earned sufficient finance, Icon Productions gave him the machinery. 2003 would see the controversy begin.. In keeping with his traditionalist beliefs, The Passion Of The Christ stayed true to the words of the Gospels. For added authenticity, Gibson dared to have his actors speak in Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin, with subtitled translations. Beyond this, he did not shy away from the violence and degradation suffered by Jesus as he was betrayed, beaten, scourged, humiliated and crucified. The movie would be an intensely disturbing experience, but it created waves long before it was released. That Gibson's father was accused of being a "Holocaust denier" didn't help (Gibson retorted that his dad had simply claimed that less than 6 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis). Jewish pressure groups such as the Anti-Defamation League and the Simon Wiesenthal Centre leapt on the movie. A group of scholars, activists and Catholic ecumenists, keen that the Jews should not be offended, somehow got hold of the script and compiled an 18-page list of Gibson's supposed transgressions (basically they were demanding that the film be remade entirely). People in Hollywood began to turn against him. Life was becoming very difficult, dangerous even.. Courageously, Gibson and Icon held their ground. The group of complainants, they said, were in possession of a stolen script and should return it immediately. Meanwhile, Icon's PR people began to target Christian groups, evangelicals and conservative columnists. There was a long series of screenings, with Gibson usually present to personally charm the audience. Crucially, the Catholic Church distanced itself from the furore, meaning that any complaints were not official. The movie would remain uncensored. Apart, that is, from the one line that most believed to be the most contentious of all - "His blood be on us, and on our children". Genuinely fearing the reaction of extremists if he did not compromise in some way, Gibson would have the line spoken, but remove its subtitle.As it turned out, the controversy proved to be the best marketing tool in screen history. Before The Passion Of The Christ was released on Ash Wednesday, 2004, interest from Christian groups and the general public was such that a new record was set for pre-sales. The film stormed to Number One at the US box office and would return there over the Good Friday weekend. It would be the highest grossing R film in US history. Taking $370 million in America and $604 million worldwide it would be the 29th biggest movie of all time. There would be 203 million rentals in the States. And Gibson, who financed it to the tune of $25 million, who appeared in the film only as the hands that nail Jesus to the cross, was projected to make $360 million in 2004 alone. A year later his fortune would be estimated at $850 million, making him by far the wealthiest actor in the world.Of course, for Gibson The Passion wasn't about money, it was about the public expression of his traditionalist beliefs. Through an entity he controlled called the AJ Reilly Foundation he'd built a traditionalist chapel called Holy Family near his home in the Agoura Hills where he worshipped daily. He was seriously making up for those years of sinning. But he was also human enough to bend, to learn, to adapt. He'd publicly state the debt he owed to his wife for standing by him. He'd also admit to being too strict a disciplinarian with his first three children (the eldest, Hannah, would actually enter a drug rehab programme in February, 2004). Perhaps by way of recompense, he'd buy for the family the Fijian island of Mago - 2,160 hectares of paradise for $15 million.. As for acting, Gibson would now be seldom seen. He'd pop up very briefly as an anger management patient in the crude thriller Paparazzi, but mostly his energies were now directed into production and directing. With offices worldwide, Icon were now dealing with classy international pictures like Whale Rider and Maria Full Of Grace (like Miramax but not so crass), as well as TV shows like Complete Savages, apparently based on Gibson's own home life. Also, Gibson had another directorial project on the go. This would be Apocalypto, an epic set at the end of the Mayan civilisation, where decadent leaders decide the gods must be appeased by more temples and human sacrifices and a would-be victim, having fled into the forest, must find some way to save his nation and its soul. Gibson would find more controversy when, though known as a staunch Republican, he said he saw parallels between his film's despotic villains and the government of George W Bush. He'd recently also spoken out against euthanasia and stem cell research and, having donated millions of children's hospitals, was proving difficult for liberals to demonize.Having been a star for twenty-five years, Mel Gibson is now one of the biggest. Thankfully, he still works hard to produce good material and, perhaps better still, refuses to take his celebrity seriously. When voted The Sexiest Man Alive, for instance, he said "That implies there are a lot of dead guys who got more points than me". Perhaps it's due to Australia. His character was formed there, his career was launched there, and they know it, in 1997 making him an Officer of the Order of Australia, the highest award they could confer (well, they couldn't make him captain of the cricket team, could they?). So forget the Yank stuff, the guy's obviously a fair dinkum Aussie. Dominic Wills

Birth Name: Mel Columcille Gerard GibsonBirth Place: Peekskill, NYDate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 01/03/1956, CapricornProfession: Actor; director; producer; screenwriter
A walking dichotomy, this controversial Hollywood megastar is the embodiment of prankster and preacher, hero and villain, success and failure, both on and off screen. Born in the U.S. but raised in Australia from age 12, the ruggedly handsome, blue-eyed actor hit it big (at least Down Under) in 1979, with a pair of antithetical films. He earned an Australian Film Institute Award as a mentally challenged laborer involved with an older woman in Tim, and proved himself an able action hero in Mad Max, which launched a successful franchise. But his international breakthrough came two years later, when he again showcased his range as a short-distance runner in the World War I-set Gallipoli (snagging him a second Australian Film Institute Award) and a return run as Mad Max in The Road Warrior. Hollywood pounced on the actor, and while his U.S. career got off to a rocky start with a number of flops, he became an icon playing a crazy cop in the 1987 smash Lethal Weapon, marking the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Gibson and director Richard Donner. Over the years, the two worked together on a number of movies, including three more Lethal Weapon flicks. He worked steadily in the 1990s and even went behind the camera, winning an Oscar for best director for his second feature, the Scottish war saga Braveheart. Although the devout Catholic was well liked in Hollywood, charming his costars with his outrageous on-set pranks and donating millions to charity, he was never one to shy away from controversy. In 2004, Gibson wrote, produced, directed and independently financed The Passion of Christ, an extremely graphic depiction of Jesus Christ's suffering on the day of his crucifixion. Critics claimed that the film had an anti-Semitic slant---a claim the auteur disputed on various TV news shows---and regardless of the film's social politics, it was a box-office smash. After keeping a low profile for the next two years, Gibson's name was suddenly plastered all over the media again when he made anti-Semitic remarks while being arrested for drunken driving in July 2006. He quickly checked into rehab, but the incident took a huge toll on his professional and personal life. A month after his arrest, he separated from Robyn Moore, his wife of 28 years with whom he had seven children. She filed for divorce in April 2009 citing "irreconcilable differences." And in October 2009, Gibson welcomed another child with then-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva, but the pair called it quits several months later. In 2010, Gibson appeared on-screen again, in the revenge thriller film, Edge of Darkness, while preparing to go behind the camera again, stating that he'd be helming an upcoming Viking movie.Mel Gibson Fast Facts:
 The night before his Mad Max audition, a bar fight left him with a black eye and stitches---the exact apocalyptic, world-weary look that director George Miller was seeking. When the 1979 film was released stateside, an American actor dubbed Gibson's voice. 
Was arrested in 1984 for drunken driving while filming Mrs. Soffel, 22 years before his much more infamous DUI arrest in 2006. 
Named People magazine's first Sexiest Man Alive in 1985 and has been frequently cited in their annual Most Beautiful People issue. 
His father was involved with the Alliance for Catholic Tradition, a group opposed to the more liberal philosophies of the post-Vatican II Catholic Church; this influenced Mel's own conservative stance. 
A renowned practical joker, he has famously played pranks on costars including Rene Russo and Julia Roberts, and director Ron Howard. 
Produced a number of TV projects, including the short-lived sitcom Complete Savages, which was loosely inspired by his own life. 
 His self-financed directorial vision of the final hours leading to the crucifixion of Jesus, 2004's The Passion of the Christ, spurred debate over a possible anti-Semitic backlash while breaking box-office records. 
Two years later, he was involved in another headline-producing situation with the Jewish community when he made anti-Semitic remarks during the course of a drunken-driving arrest. 
Decided to take a break from acting in 2002, so he could focus on writing, producing and directing. Made a major break from his near-hiatus with a starring role in the 2010 big-screen adaption of the BBC series Edge of Darkness, which did not fare well at the box office.

Despite a thick Australian accent in some of his earlier films, actor Mel Gibson was born in Peeksill, NY, to Irish Catholic parents on January 3rd, 1956. One of eleven children, Gibson didn't set foot in Australia until 1968, and only developed an Aussie accent after his classmates teased him for his American tongue. Mel Gibson's looks have certainly helped him develop a largely female following similar to the equally rugged Harrison Ford, but since his 1976 screen debut in Summer City, Gibson has been recognized as a critical as well as physiological success. Though he had, at one point, set his sights on journalism, Gibson caught the acting bug by the time he had reached college age, and studied at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney, Australia, despite what he describes as a crippling ordeal with stage fright. Luckily, this was something he overcame relatively quickly -- Gibson was still a student when he filmed Summer City and it didn't take long before he had found work playing supporting roles for the South Australia Theatre Company after his graduation.  By 1979, Gibson had already demonstrated a unique versatility. In the drama Tim, a then 22-year-old Gibson played the role of a mildly retarded handy man well enough to win him a Sammy award -- one of the Australian entertainment industry's highest accolades -- while his leather clad portrayal of a post-apocalyptic cop in Mad Max helped the young actor gain popularity with a very different type of audience. Gibson wouldn't become internationally famous, however, until after his performance in Mad Max 2 (1981), one of the few sequels to have proved superior to its predecessor.  In 1983, Gibson collaborated with director Peter Weir for the second time (though it was largely overlooked during the success of Mad Max 2, Gibson starred in Weir's powerful WWI drama Gallipoli in 1981) for The Year of Living Dangerously, in which he played a callous reporter responsible for covering a bloody Indonesian coup. Shortly afterwards, Gibson made his Hollywood debut in The Bounty with Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins, and starred opposite Sissy Spacek in The River during the same year. He would also star in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985) alongside singer Tina Turner. After the third installment to the Mad Max franchise, Gibson took a two-year break, only to reappear opposite Danny Glover in director Richard Donner's smash hit Lethal Weapon. The role featured Gibson as Martin Riggs, a volatile police officer reeling from the death of his wife, and cemented a spot as one of Hollywood's premier action stars. Rather than letting himself become typecast, however, Gibson would surprise critics and audiences alike when he accepted the title role in Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet (1990). Though his performance earned mixed reviews, he was applauded for taking on such a famously tragic script. In the early '90s, Gibson founded ICON Productions, and through it made his directorial debut with 1993's The Man Without a Face. The film, which also starred Gibson as a horrifically burned teacher harboring a secret, achieved only middling box-office success, though it was considered a well-wrought effort for a first-time director. Gibson would fare much better in 1994 when he rejoined Richard Donner in the movie adaptation of Maverick; however, it would be another year before Gibson's penchant for acting, directing, and producing was given its due. In 1995, Gibson swept the Oscars with Braveheart, his epic account of 13th century Scottish leader William Wallace's lifelong struggle to forge an independent nation. Later that year, he lent his vocal talents -- surprising many with his ability to carry a tune -- for the part of John Smith in Disney's animated feature Pocahontas.  Through the '90s, Gibson's popularity and reputation continued to grow, thanks to such films as Ransom (1996) and Conspiracy Theory (1997). In 1998, Gibson further increased this popularity with the success of two films, Lethal Weapon 4 and Payback. More success followed in 2000 due to the actor's lead role as an animated rooster in Nick Park and Peter Lord's hugely acclaimed Chicken Run, and to his work as the titular hero of Roland Emmerich's blockbuster period epic The Patriot (2000). After taking up arms in the battlefield of a more modern era in the Vietman drama We Were Soldiers in 2002, Gibson would step in front of the cameras once more for Sixth Sense director M. Night Shyamalan's dramatic sci-fi thriller Signs (also 2002). The film starred Gibson as a grieving patriarch whose rural existence was even further disturbed by the discovery of several crop circles on his property. Gibson would return to more familiar territory in Randall Wallace's We Were Soldiers -- a 2002 war drama which found Gibson in the role of Lt. Col. Hal Moore, commander of the First Battalion, Seventh Cavalry -- the same regiment so fatefully led by George Armstrong Custer. In 2003, Gibson starred alongside Robert Downey Jr. and Robin Wright-Penn in a remake of The Singing Detective.  The year 2004 saw Gibson return to the director's chair for The Passion of The Christ. Funded by 25 million of Gibson's own dollars, the religious drama generated controversy amid cries of anti-Semitism. Despite the debates surrounding the film -- and the fact that all of the dialogue was spoken in Latin and Aramaic -- it nearly recouped its budget in the first day of release. The actor stepped behind the camera again in 2006 with the Mayan tale Apocalypto and was preparing to product a TV movie about the Holocaust, but by this time, public attention was not pointed at Gibson's career choices. That summer, he was pulled over for drunk driving at which time he made extremely derogatory comments about Jewish people to the arresting officer. When word of Gibson's drunken, bigoted tirade made it to the press, the speculation of the actor's anti-Semitic leanings that had circulated because of the choices he'd made in his depiction of the crucifixion in Passion of the Christ seemed confirmed. Gibson's father being an admitted holocaust denier hadn't helped matters and now it seemed that no PR campaign could help. Gibson publicly apologized, expressed extreme regret for his comments, and checked himself into rehab. Still, the plug was pulled on Gibson's Holocaust project and the filmmaker's reputation was irreparably tarnished. ~ Sandra Brennan, Rovi

Mel Gibson, in full Mel Columcille Gerard Gibson   (born January 3, 1956, Peekskill, New York, U.S.), American-born Australian actor, who became an international star with a series of action-adventure films in the 1980s and later earned acclaim as a director and producer.
When he was 12 years old, Gibson’s family moved to Australia. In 1974 he enrolled in the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney, and while at school he made his film debut playing a surfer in Summer City (1977). After graduating in 1977, he joined the State Theatre Company of South Australia. Two years later he starred as a renegade cop seeking revenge in the futuristic action film Mad Max (1979). His portrayal of a mentally disabled handyman in the romance Tim (1979) earned Gibson the Australian Film Institute’s award for best actor. He won the award again in 1981 for his performance in the war drama Gallipoli.
With the release of Mad Max 2 (1981; U.S. title The Road Warrior [1982]), Gibson became an international star. He subsequently established himself as a top box office draw with Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985) and the action-packed Lethal Weapon series. In addition, he earned critical praise for more-serious fare, including The Year of Living Dangerously (1982) and Hamlet (1990), the first film made by his production company, ICON Productions. In 1993 he made his directorial debut with The Man Without a Face, in which he also starred. Gibson next directed the epic Braveheart (1995), in which he portrayed the Scottish national hero Sir William Wallace. The film won five Academy Awards, including best picture and best director.
After a string of successful films—including Ransom (1996) and Signs (2002)—Gibson returned to directing with The Passion of the Christ (2004), an account of the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ’s life that was based primarily on the biblical Gospels, with dialogue in Aramaic and Latin (with English subtitles). Although The Passion was a box office success, among the top-grossing movies of all time, some critics charged that the film was anti-Semitic, gratuitously violent, and historically inaccurate. In 2006 Apocalypto was released. Directed by Gibson, the violent film was set during the collapse of the Mayan empire and featured dialogue in Mayan (with English subtitles).
Gibson’s popularity declined somewhat in the early 21st century, owing in part to a string of offscreen incidents that many believed demonstrated a hostility toward certain minority groups, particularly Jews. In 2010 he returned to acting, portraying a police detective investigating his daughter’s murder in Edge of Darkness; it was his first starring role in eight years. The following year he portrayed a depressed man whose life is invigorated by his use of a hand puppet in the drama The Beaver. Gibson’s later films include Machete Kills (2013), an over-the-top action thriller in which he played a villain.

Here is a true story by Paul Harvey. Pass it to anyone who you think would find it interesting and inspiring. You will be surprised who this young man turned out to be. (Do not look at the bottom if this letter until you have read it fully.)
Years ago a hardworking man took his family from New York State to Australia to take advantage of a work opportunity there. Part of this man's family was handsome young son who had aspirations of joining the circus as a trapeze artist or an actor. This young fellow, biding his time until a circus job or even one as a stagehand came along, worked at the local shipyards which bordered on the worst section of town. Walking home from work one evening this young man was attacked by five thugs who wanted to rob him. Instead of just giving up his money the young fellow resisted. However they bested him easily and proceeded to beat him to a pulp.  They mashed his face with their boots, and kicked and beat his body brutally with clubs, leaving him for dead. When the police happened to find him lying in the road they assumed he was dead and called for the Morgue Wagon.
On the way to the morgue a policeman heard him gasp for air, and they immediately took him to the emergency unit at the hospital. When he was placed on a gurney a nurse remarked to her horror, that his young man no longer had a face. Each eye socket was smashed, his skull, legs, and arms fractured, his nose literally hanging from his face, all is teeth were gone, and his jaw was almost completely torn from his skull. Although his life was spared he spent over year in the hospital. When he finally left his body may have healed but his face was disgusting to look at. He was no longer the handsome youth that everyone admired.
When the young man started to look for work again he was turned down by everyone just on account of the way he looked. One potential employer suggested to him that he join the freak show at the circus as The Man Who Had No Face. And he did this for a while. He was still rejected by everyone and no one wanted to be seen in his company. He had thoughts of suicide. This went on for five years.
One day he passed a church and sought some solace there. Entering the church he encountered a priest who had saw him sobbing while kneeling in a pew. The priest took pity on him and took him to the rectory where they talked at length. The priest was impressed with him to such a degree that he said that he would do everything possible for him that could be done to restore his dignity and life, if the young man would promise to be the best Catholic he could be, and trust in God's mercy to free him from his torturous life. The young man went to Mass and communion every day, and after thanking God for saving his life, asked God to only give him peace of mind and the grace to be the best man he could ever be in His eyes.
The priest, through his personal contacts was able to secure the services of the best plastic surgeon in Australia. They would be no cost to the young man, as the doctor was the priest's best friend. The doctor too was so impressed by the young man, whose outlook now on life, even though he had experienced the worse was filled with good humor and love.
The surgery was a miraculous success. All the best dental work was also done for him. The young man became everything he promised God he would be. He was also blessed with a wonderful, beautiful wife, and many children, and success in an industry which would have been the furthest thing from his mind as a career if not for the goodness of God and the love of the people who cared for him. This he acknowledges publicly.
His life was the inspiration for his production of the movie "The Man Without A  Face." He is to be admired by all of us as a God fearing man, a political conservative, and an example to all as a true man of courage.     
Origins:   This piece, which began circulating in the latter half of the year 2000, is neither an accurate 
description of actor/director Mel Gibson's early life nor a transcription of a radio piece by commentator 
Paul Harvey. Suffice it to say that someone took the framework of Mel Gibson's biography and built upon it a touching but completely fictitious house of glurge.
Mel Gibson's father did move his family from New York to Sydney, Australia, when Mel was 12, but the similarities between this piece and Mel's real life end there.  Young Mel wasn't dreaming of "joining the circus as a trapeze artist"; he was a Catholic high school student mulling over the possibilities of becoming a chef or a journalist and ended up enrolling in the University of New South Wales' National Institute of Dramatic Art.  Young Mel had a role in the low-budget film Summer City while still a student and then appeared in a number of productions with the State Theatre Company of South Australia before the lucky break that catapulted him to stardom: being chosen for the lead role in George Miller's action film Mad Max.
A little bit of truth may have sneaked into the story quoted above at this point.  The night before his Mad Max audition, Gibson reportedly came in a poor second in a barroom brawl, ending up with a face "like a busted grapefruit."  He then had to audition for the Mad Max role with a bruised, swollen, discolored, and freshly stitched face — an appearance that, legend has it, helped win over producers who wanted someone weathered and rough-looking to take the part.  
 The beating Gibson received did not, however, leave him with "smashed eye sockets," fracture his "skull, legs, and arms," result in the loss of "all his teeth" or a nose that was "hanging from his face" or a "jaw almost completely torn from his skull."  He didn't spend "over a year in the hospital," nor did five years pass with Mel in agony before "plastic surgery restored his looks."  His face got smashed up a bit, he required a few stitches to close some open cuts, and a few weeks later he was good as new.  (However, some Hollywood pundits maintain that even the milder "barroom brawl" version was a bit of fiction invented by a publicist.) 
Mel Gibson did direct and star in The Man Without a Face, a 1993 film about a man who became a recluse after his face was disfigured in an automobile accident, but the movie was based upon a novel by Isabelle Holland, not Mel Gibson's life.
Many of our readers have sworn to us they heard Paul Harvey recite this piece, exactly as reproduced above, on one of his broadcasts.  Paul Harvey did offer a "Rest of the Story" segment about Mel Gibson on 24 June 2000, and it was a typically (for Paul Harvey) exaggerated version of the truth, but it didn't come close to the glurge reproduced here.  What he reported, verbatim, was this:
In all his years as a cop, Ollie Gerrick had never seen a beating case like the one before him. The boy's face was smashed in. His partner say he wouldn't survive. The ambulance arrived and took him to the hospital and when he came to, the doctors told him the rest of the story. He was in the hospital and then he remembered that night in the bar. It was late the next night that the young man remembered he had an important appointment. He realized it was tomorrow. He struggled to get out of bed but the nurse restrained him. The next morning, he got out of bed and looked in the mirror and he didn't recognize himself. Nevertheless, he went on to the job interview. Despite the bar fight in October of 1977. He showed up for a role in a movie and the producers were looking for someone unknown who was really tough looking. He got the role they were casting for. They were looking for someone to play the rugged role of Mad Max and this Australian with the beaten up face went on to become one of our best modern-day actors. We know him as Mel Gibson, and now you know the rest of the story.
Update:   The February 2004 release of the film The Passion of the Christ, financed and directed by Mel Gibson, started this legend circulating anew, often with tacked-on codas such as the following:
Note: This may well help in the understanding of why Mel Gibson's love for the Lord is why he has made such a powerful movie "The Passion" that's coming out February 25th to demonstrate Jesus love and sacrifice for us.

Magazine poll in 1996. He has also won three Australian Film Institute awards, two Blockbuster Entertainment awards for Favorite Actor, Four People's Choice Awards for Favorite Motion Picture Actor and a Golden Globe for Best Director of Braveheart.
His friends know him as a prankster, conservative thinker, self-deprecating humorist and staunch Roman Catholic opposed to birth control and abortion. Alcoholics Anonymous know him as someone struggling to control
"My biggest weakness is that I'm excessive," he says.  "Fortunately for everyone concerned, I'm not as excessive as I used to be."
Gibson has no truck with feminists and he is not a favorite of theirs either. He believes that women are not equal, just different. He believes in capital punishment as well as the right to bear arms. He encourages his kids to run around the woods and "kill"
each other with paint balls. He bragged once that his then six-year-old was a "regular killing machine."  As for his opinion of former president Bill Clinton, he characterizes him as a "low level opportunist."
On the softer side, Gibson is an opera buff and an aficionado of Beethoven. His fellow actors can't say enough about him as a colleague who cares about everyone's performance. Having won an Academy Award for Best Director for his work on Braveheart, several years later, Gibson took on another project close to his heartThe Passion of the Christ. The story of the last days of Jesus Christ, the film was the center of much controversy, due to the fact that Gibson, who directed the film but did not act role in it, claims the entire film will be in a foreign language, without subtitles and in addition, various religious groups have been protesting and/or praising the film. However, it wound up being a huge hit, grossing over US$370 million at the domestic box office alone. 
He has since directed Apocalypto (2006), a film about the Mayan culture, spoken in Yucatec Maya. In July 2006, Gibson made anti-Semitic remarks while being arrested for drunk driving. He later apologized, but the incident was deemed by many to be a black spot on Gibson's career. It became clear that it hadn't affected the success of his movie, however, as Apocalypto opened in the top spot at the weekend box office in December 2006. He most recently starred in Machete Kills(2013)alongside Danny Trejo and Sofia Vergara. 
Gibson and his wife of 28 years, Robyn, with whom he has seven children, were divorced in 2009, the same year his Russian mistress, Oksana, gave birth to a daughter. They have since also split.
