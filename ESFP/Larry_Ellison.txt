					Teachers can find prepared lesson plans featuring Lawrence Ellison in the Achievement Curriculum section:
Lawrence J. Ellison was born in the Bronx, New York. At nine months, he contracted pneumonia, and his unmarried 19-year-old mother gave him to her  aunt and uncle in Chicago to raise. Lawrence was raised in a two-bedroom apartment on the city's South Side. Until he was twelve years old he did not know that he was adopted. His adoptive father had lost his real estate business in the Great Depression and made a modest living as an auditor for the public housing authority. As a boy, Larry Ellison showed an independent, rebellious streak and often clashed with his adoptive father. From an early age, he showed a strong aptitude for math and science, and was named science student of the year at the University of Illinois. 
During the final exams in his second year, Larry Ellison's adoptive mother died, and he dropped out of school. He enrolled at the University of Chicago the following fall, but dropped out again after the first semester. His adoptive father was now convinced that Larry would never make anything of himself, but the seemingly aimless young man had already learned the rudiments of computer programming in Chicago. He took this skill with him to Berkeley, California, arriving with just enough money for fast food and a few tanks of gas. For the next eight years, Ellison bounced from job to job, working as a technician for Fireman's Fund and Wells Fargo bank. As a programmer at Amdahl Corporation, he participated in building the first IBM-compatible mainframe system. 
In 1977, Ellison and two of his Amdahl colleagues, Robert Miner and Ed Oates, founded their own company, Software Development Labs. From the beginning, Ellison served as Chief Executive Officer. Ellison had come across a paper called "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks" by Edgar F. ("Ted") Codd, describing a concept Codd had developed at IBM. Codd's employers saw no commercial potential in the concept of a Structured Query Language (SQL), but Larry Ellison did.
Ellison and his partners won a two-year contract to build a relational database management system (RDBMS) for the CIA. The project's code name: Oracle. They finished the project a year ahead of schedule and used the extra time to develop their system for commercial applications. They named their commercial RDBMS Oracle as well. In 1980, Ellison's company had only eight employees, and revenues were less than $1 million, but the following year, IBM itself adopted Oracle for its mainframe systems, and Oracle's sales doubled every year for the next seven years,. The million dollar company was becoming a billion dollar company. Ellison renamed the company Oracle Corporation, for its best-selling product.
Oracle went public in 1986, raising $31.5 million with its initial public offering, but the firm's zealous young staff habitually overstated revenues, and in 1990 the company posted its first losses. Oracle's market capitalization fell by 80 percent and the company appeared to be on the verge of bankruptcy. Accepting the need for drastic change, he replaced much of the original senior staff with more experienced managers. For the first time, he delegated the management side of the business to professionals, and channeled his own energies into product development. A new version of the database program Oracle 7, released in 1992, swept the field and made Oracle the industry leader in database management software. In only two years the company's stock had regained much of its previous value.
Even as Oracle's fortunes rose again, Ellison suffered a series of personal mishaps. Long an enthusiast of strenuous outdoor activities, Ellison suffered serious injuries while body surfing and mountain biking. He recovered from major surgery, and continued to race his 78-foot yacht, Sayonara, and to practice aerobatics in a succession of private jets, including decommissioned fighter planes. In 1998, Ellison and Sayonara won the Sydney to Hobart race, overcoming near-hurricane winds that sank five other boats, drowning six participants. Ellison is a principal supporter of the BMW Oracle Racing team, which has been a significant force in America's Cup competition. His yacht, Rising Sun, over 450 feet long, is one of the largest privately owned vessels in the world. 
Oracle's fortunes continued to rise throughout the 1990s. America's banks, airlines, automobile companies and retail giants all came to depend on Oracle's database programs. Under Ellison's leadership, Oracle became a pioneer in providing business applications over the Internet. Oracle benefited hugely from the growth of electronic commerce; its net profits increased by 76 percent in a single quarter of the year 2000. As the stocks of other high tech companies fluctuated wildly, Oracle held its value, and its largest shareholder, founder and CEO Larry Ellison, came close to a long-cherished goal, surpassing Microsoft's Bill Gates to become the richest man in the world.
Beginning in 2004, Ellison set out to increase Oracle's market share through a series of strategic acquisitions. Oracle spent more than $25 billion in only three years to buy a flock of companies and large and small, makers of software for managing data, identity, retail inventory and logistics. The first major acquisition was PeopleSoft, purchased at the end of 2004 for $10.3 billion. No sooner was the ink dry on the PeopleSoft deal than Ellison trumped rival SAP to acquire retail software developer Retek. Within the following year, Oracle also acquired competitor Siebel Systems. Ellison capped this buying spree with the acquisition of business intelligence software provider Hyperion Solutions in 2007. Two years later, in the depths of a global recession, Ellison once again acted boldly, acquiring computer hardware and software manufacturer Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion. Oracle became the world's largest business software company, supplying all 100 of of the Fortune Global 100. 
Today, Lawrence Ellison has his principal home in Woodside, California. He served as President of Oracle from 1978 to 1996, and undertook two stints as Chairman of the Board, from 1990 to 1992, and again from 1995 to 2004. Since its founding, he has been Oracle's only Chief Executive Officer. 
After many years of pursuing a victory in the America's Cup yacht race, Ellison triumphed at last in 2010. Ellison joined the crew of the BMW Oracle for the second leg of the two-day competition, when the giant trimaran, with its revolutionary 223-foot wing sail, ended the race five minutes and 25 seconds ahead of the second-place finisher. Ellison's victory brought the 159-year-old America's Cup, the oldest trophy in international sports, back to the United States for the first time in 15 years.
The America's Cup race is scheduled by agreement between the defending champion and the challenger who has qualified through a preceding series of races. In recent decades, the contest has been held roughly once every three years. The United States, represented by the Golden Gate Yacht Club and Ellison's Team Oracle had their first opportunity to defend their hard-won title in September 2013. At Ellison's insistence, the 2103 contest was held in San Francisco Bay, where it could easily be witnessed by spectators on shore.  The contest consisted of a series of races, with the cup going to the first team to win nine races. Both teams now raced wing-sail catamarans. The competing craft would be the most technically sophisticated -- and most expensive -- racing yachts ever built. The opening rounds went badly for Team Oracle, with challenger New Zealand Emirates taking the lead. New Zealand won the first eight races, apparently dooming the Oracle team to defeat. In a stunning turnaround, Oracle took the next race, and the next, and the next, winning the contest nine races to eight. Just as Ellison revolutionized  the world of business software, so has he transformed the sport of yacht racing.

Lawrence Joseph "Larry" Ellison (born August 17, 1944) is an American businessman, best known as the co-founder and chief executive officer of Oracle Corporation, an enterprise software company. In 2014, Forbes listed him as the third-wealthiest man in America and as the fifth-wealthiest person in the world, with a fortune of $52 billion.[2]
Larry Ellison was born in New York City to an unwed Jewish mother.[3][4][5][6] His father was an Italian American US Air Force pilot. After Ellison contracted pneumonia at the age of nine months, his mother gave him to her aunt and uncle for adoption.[6] He did not meet his biological mother again until he was 48.[7]
Ellison graduated from Eugene Field Elementary School in Chicago in January 1958 and attended Sullivan High School at least through the fall of 1959 before moving to Chicago's South Shore, a middle-class Jewish neighborhood. Ellison remembers his adoptive mother as warm and loving, in contrast to his austere, unsupportive, and often distant adoptive father, who adopted the name Ellison to honor his point of entry into the United States, Ellis Island. Louis Ellison was a government employee who had made a small fortune in Chicago real estate, only to lose it during the Great Depression.[6]
Although Ellison was raised in a Reform Jewish home by his adoptive parents, who attended synagogue regularly, he remained a religious skeptic. Ellison states: "While I think I am religious in one sense, the particular dogmas of Judaism are not dogmas I subscribe to. I don't believe that they are real. They're interesting stories. They're interesting mythology, and I certainly respect people who believe these are literally true, but I don't. I see no evidence for this stuff." At age thirteen, Ellison refused to have a bar mitzvah celebration.[8] Ellison says that he has a love affair with Israel that is not connected to religious sentiments, but rather due to the innovative spirit of Israelis, particularly in the technology sector.[9]
He left the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign after his second year, after not taking his final exams because his adoptive mother had just died. After spending a summer in northern California, Ellison attended the University of Chicago for one term, where he first encountered computer design. In 1966, aged 22, he moved to northern California.
During the 1970s, after a brief stint at Amdahl Corporation, Ellison began working for Ampex Corporation. His projects included a database for the CIA, which he named "Oracle". Ellison was inspired by a paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database systems called "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks".[10] In 1977, he founded Software Development Laboratories (SDL) with two partners and an investment of $2,000; $1,200 of the money was his.
In 1979 the company renamed itself Relational Software Inc., and in 1982 officially became Oracle Systems Corporation after its flagship product, the Oracle database. Ellison had heard about the IBM System R database, also based on Codd's theories, and wanted Oracle to achieve compatibility with it, but IBM made this impossible by refusing to share System R's code. The initial release of Oracle[when?] was called Oracle 2; there was no Oracle 1.[citation needed]
In 1990, Oracle laid off 10% of its work force (about 400 people) because it was losing money. This crisis, which almost resulted in Oracle's bankruptcy, came about because of Oracle's "up-front" marketing strategy, in which sales people urged potential customers to buy the largest possible amount of software all at once. The sales people then booked the value of future license sales in the current quarter, thereby increasing their bonuses. This became a problem when the future sales subsequently failed to materialize. Oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice, and had to settle class-action lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings. Ellison would later say that Oracle had made "an incredible business mistake".[citation needed]
Although IBM dominated the mainframe relational database market with its DB2 and SQL/DS database products, it delayed entering the market for a relational database on UNIX and Windows operating-systems. This left the door open for Sybase, Oracle, Informix, and eventually Microsoft to dominate mid-range systems and microcomputers.
Around this time, Oracle fell behind Sybase. From 1990 to 1993, Sybase was the fastest growing database company and the database industry's darling vendor, but soon fell victim to merger mania. Sybase's 1996 merger with Powersoft resulted in a loss of focus on its core database technology. In 1993, Sybase sold the rights to its database software running under the Windows operating system to Microsoft Corporation, which now markets it under the name "SQL Server".
In 1994, Informix overtook Sybase and became Oracle's most important rival. The intense war between Informix CEO Phil White and Ellison was front page Silicon Valley news for three years. In April 1997, Informix announced a major revenue shortfall and earnings restatements. Phil White eventually landed in jail, and IBM absorbed Informix in 2001. Also in 1997, Ellison was made a director of Apple Computer after Steve Jobs returned to the company. Ellison resigned in 2002, saying "my schedule does not currently allow me to attend enough of the formal board meetings to warrant a role as a director".[11]
With the defeat of Informix and of Sybase, Oracle enjoyed years of industry dominance until the rise of Microsoft SQL Server in the late 1990s and IBM's acquisition of Informix Software in 2001 to complement their DB2 database. As of 2013[update] Oracle's main competition for new database licenses on UNIX, Linux, and Windows operating systems comes from IBM's DB2 and from Microsoft SQL Server, which only runs on Windows. IBM's DB2 still dominates the mainframe database market.
In 2005, Oracle Corporation paid Ellison a $975,000 salary, a $6,500,000 bonus, and other compensation of $955,100.[12] In 2007, Ellison earned a total compensation of $61,180,524, which included a base salary of $1,000,000, a cash bonus of $8,369,000, and options granted of $50,087,100.[13] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $84,598,700, which included a base salary of $1,000,000, a cash bonus of $10,779,000, no stock grants, and options granted of $71,372,700.[14] In the year ending May 31, 2009 he made $56.8 million.[15] In 2006, Forbes ranked him as the richest Californian.[2]
In April 2009, after a tug-of-war with IBM and Hewlett-Packard, Oracle announced its intent to buy Sun Microsystems.[16]
On July 2, 2009, for the fourth year in a row, Oracle's board awarded Ellison another 7 million stock options.[17] On August 22, 2009, it was reported that Ellison would be paid only $1 for his base salary for the fiscal year of 2010, down from the $1,000,000 he was paid in fiscal 2009.[1]
The European Union approved Oracle's acquisition of Sun Microsystems on January 21, 2010, and agreed that Oracle's acquisition of Sun "has the potential to revitalize important assets and create new and innovative products".[18] The Sun acquisition also gave Oracle control of the popular MySQL open source database, which Sun had acquired in 2008.[19]
On August 9, 2010, Ellison denounced Hewlett-Packard's board for firing CEO Mark Hurd, writing that "the HP board just made the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago." (Ellison and Hurd are close personal friends.)[20] Then on September 6, Oracle hired Mark Hurd and made him Co-President alongside Safra A. Catz. Ellison retained the CEO position.[21]
As of March 10, 2010 the Forbes list of billionaires ranked Ellison as the sixth-richest person in the world. Ellison is the third-richest American, with an estimated net worth of US $28 billion.[2] On July 27, 2010, The Wall Street Journal reported that Ellison was the best-paid executive in the last decade, collecting a total compensation of US $1.84 billion.[22] In September 2011, Ellison was listed on the Forbes List of Billionaires as the fifth richest man in the world. Ellison is still the third richest American, with a net worth of about $36.5 billion.
Ellison owns stakes in Salesforce.com, NetSuite, Quark Biotechnology Inc. and Astex Pharmaceuticals.[23][24] In June 2012, Ellison agreed to buy 98 percent of the Hawaiian island of Lana'i from David Murdock's company, Castle & Cooke. The price was reported to be between $500 million and $600 million.[25]
Ellison agreed to settle a four year-old insider-trading lawsuit by offering to pay $100 million in October 2012.[26] As of September 2012, Ellison was listed on the Forbes List of Billionaires as the third richest American citizen, behind Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, with a net worth of $44 billion. As of October 2012, Ellison was listed just behind David Hamilton Koch as the 8th richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.[27]
Nancy Wheeler Jenkins from 1977 to 1978. They married six months before Ellison founded Software Development Laboratories. In 1978, the couple divorced. Wheeler gave up any claim on her husband's company for $500.[31]
Barbara Boothe from 1983 to 1986. Barbara was a former receptionist at Relational Software Inc (RSI).[31] They had two children, David and Megan, film producers at Skydance Productions and Annapurna Pictures, respectively.[32]
Melanie Craft, a romance novelist, from 2003 to 2010. They married on December 18, 2003, at his Woodside estate. Ellison's late friend Steve Jobs, former CEO and co-founder of Apple, Inc, was the official wedding photographer,[33] and Representative Tom Lantos officiated. They divorced in 2010.[34]
Ellison made a brief cameo appearance in the 2010 movie Iron Man 2.[35] In 2010, Ellison purchased a 50% share of the BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament.[36] Ellison owns many exotic cars, including an Audi R8 and a McLaren F1. His favorite is the Acura NSX, which he was known to give as gifts each year during its production.[24] Ellison is also reportedly the owner of a Lexus LFA and a Lexus LS600hL.[37]
BMW Oracle Racing was the Challenger of Record on behalf of the Golden Gate Yacht Club of San Francisco for the 2007 America's Cup in Valencia, Spain until eliminated from the 2007 Louis Vuitton Cup challenger selection series in the semi-finals. On February 14, 2010, Ellison's yacht USA 17 won the second race (in the best of three "deed of gift" series) of the 33rd America's Cup, after winning the first race two days earlier. Securing a historic victory, Ellison and his BMW Oracle team became the first challengers to win a "deed of gift" match. The Cup returned to American shores for the first time since 1995. Ellison was a crew member for the second race.[38]
Previously, Ellison filed several legal challenges, through the Golden Gate Yacht Club, against the way that Ernesto Bertarelli (also one of the world's richest men) proposed to organize the 33rd America's Cup following the 2007 victory of Bertarelli's team Alinghi.[39] The races were finally held[clarification needed] in February 2010 in Valencia, Spain.
In 2010, Ellison ended his ownership of the eighth largest yacht in the world, named Rising Sun. Ellison sold his remaining shares in the yacht[40] to music and film mogul David Geffen. Rising Sun is 453 ft. (138 m) long,[41] and reportedly cost over $200 million to build. He "downsized" to Musashi, a 288-foot (88 m) yacht built by Feadship.[42]
On September 25, 2013, Larry Ellison's Oracle Team USA defeated the Emirates Team New Zealand to win the 34th America's Cup in San Francisco Bay, California.[43] Oracle Team USA had been penalized two points in the final due to cheating by some Oracle Team USA team members during the America's Cup World Series warm-up events.[44]
Ellison is a licensed pilot who has owned several aircraft. He was cited by the city of San Jose, California for violating its limits on late-night takeoffs and landings from San Jose Mineta International Airport by planes weighing more than 75,000 pounds (34 019 kg). In January 2000, Ellison sued over the interpretation of the airport rule, contending that his Gulfstream V "plane is certified by the manufacturer to fly at two weights: 75,000 pounds, and at 90,000 pounds, for heavier loads or long flights requiring more fuel. But the pilot only lands the plane in San Jose when it weighs 75,000 pounds or less, and has the logs to prove it."[45]
US District Judge Jeremy Fogel ruled in Ellison's favor in June 2001, calling for a waiver for Ellison's jet, but did not invalidate the curfew.[46]
Ellison also owns at least two military jets: a SIAI-Marchetti S.211, a training aircraft designed in Italy, and a decommissioned MiG-29, which the US government has refused him permission to import.[47]
Ellison styled his estimated $110 million Woodside, California, estate after feudal Japanese architecture, complete with a man-made 2.3-acre (9,300 m2) lake and an extensive seismic retrofit (37°24′44.34″N 122°14′51.40″W﻿ / ﻿37.4123167°N 122.2476111°W﻿ / 37.4123167; -122.2476111).[48]
In 2004 and 2005, he purchased more than 12 properties in Malibu, California, worth more than $180 million. The $65 million Ellison spent on five contiguous lots at Malibu's Carbon Beach was the most costly residential transaction in United States history until Ron Perelman sold his Palm Beach, Florida, compound for $70 million later that same year.[49] His entertainment system cost $1 million, and includes a rock concert-sized video projector at one end of a drained swimming pool, using the gaping hole as a giant subwoofer.[50]
In early 2010, he purchased the Astor's Beechwood Mansion in Newport, Rhode Island, for $10.5 million. The property was the former summer home of the prominent Astor family. In 2011, he purchased the 249 acre Porcupine Creek Estate and private golf course in Rancho Mirage, California for $42.9 million. The property was the former home of Yellowstone Club founder Tim Blixseth, and was sold to Ellison by creditors following their divorce and bankruptcy.[51]
On June 21, 2012, Hawaii's governor, Neil Abercrombie, declared that Ellison had signed an agreement to buy most of the island of Lanai from the Castle & Cooke company, owned by David H. Murdock. Ellison owns 98% of Lanai, Hawaii's sixth-largest island.[52]
In order to settle an insider trading lawsuit arising from Ellison's selling nearly $1 billion of Oracle stock, he was allowed to donate $100 million to his own charitable foundation without admitting wrongdoing. A California judge refused to allow Oracle to pay Ellison's legal fees of $24 million. Ellison's lawyer had argued that if Ellison were to pay the fees, that could be construed as an admission of guilt. His charitable donations to Stanford University raised questions about the independence of two Stanford professors who evaluated the case's merits for Oracle.[53]
In response to the September 11 terrorist attacks, Ellison made a controversial offer to donate software to the federal government that would enable it to build and run a national identification database and issue ID cards.[54]
Forbes 2004 list of charitable donations made by the wealthiest 400 Americans stated that Ellison had donated $151,092,103, about 1% of his estimated personal wealth.[55] In June 2006, he announced he would not honor his earlier pledge of $115 million to Harvard University, claiming it was due to the departure of former President Lawrence Summers. Oracle spokesman Bob Wynne announced, "It was really Larry Summers' brainchild and once it looked like Larry Summers was leaving, Larry Ellison reconsidered ... [I]t was Larry Ellison and Larry Summers that had initially come up with this notion."[56]
In 2007, Ellison pledged $500,000 to fortify a community centre in Sderot, Israel, after discovering that the building was not fortified from rocket attacks.[57]
In August 2010, it was reported that Ellison is one of the 40 billionaires who has signed "The Giving Pledge".[58][59] Ellison wrote: "Many years ago, I put virtually all of my assets into a trust with the intent of giving away at least 95 percent of my wealth to charitable causes. I have already given hundreds of millions of dollars to medical research and education, and I will give billions more over time. Until now, I have done this giving quietly because I have long believed that charitable giving is a personal and private matter."[60]

At 67, Ellison is the fifth richest person on the planet with a net worth of $33 billion, Forbes says.
No one enjoys money like Larry. He collects real estate, cars, airplanes, yachts. As a self-made man that came from modest beginnings, he has also developed an ego the size of his fortune.
Besides spending unfathomable amounts of money acquiring stuff, Ellison says and does so many outrageous things, that satirical stories about him have been widely reported as true and true stories about him have been widely reported as false.

 Larry Ellison started the high-flying tech company Oracle with $1,200 in 1977 and turned it into a billion-dollar Silicon Valley giant. If Bill Gates is the tech world's nerd king, Ellison is its Warren Beatty: racing yachts, buying jets, and romancing beautiful women. His rise to fame and fortune is a tale of entrepreneurial brilliance, ruthless tactics, and a constant stream of half-truths and outright fabrications for which the man and his company are notorious.Investigative reporter Mike Wilson, with access to Ellison himself and more than 125 of his friends, enemies, and former Oracle employees, has created an eye-opening, utterly fascinating portrayal of a Silicon Valley success story ... filled with the stuff that dreams and cultural icons are made of.

       It seems like all of the biggest names in the computer industry are getting the celebrity bio treatment these days. But no corporate CEO deserves it more than Larry Ellison, the charismatic head of Oracle Corp. This isn't your standard, dry, "learn-from-his-example" type of life. It's not that Ellison's life doesn't offer the same lessons in hard-won business success as some of his colleague's, because it certainly does. It's just vastly more entertaining. In The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison, author Mike Wilson delivers a fascinating and genuinely interesting portrayal of Silicon Valley's most notorious bad boy, constructed from hundreds of interviews with friends, colleagues, and those unfortunate enough to stand in Ellison's way. There are plenty of behind-the-scenes stories of the growth and worldwide success of Oracle, which Ellison founded in 1977. Plus, there's plenty of the good stuff: tales of Ellison's truly fast-lane lifestyle, filled with big boats, beautiful women, and celebrity friends. While this book probably won't transform you into a fan of Ellison's, you will be grateful for a chance to observe him--from a safe distance. The punchline is "God doesn't think he's Larry Ellison," of course.
       An authorized biography of Oracle's founder and brash billionaire leader. Ellison, the adopted son of a Jewish couple from Chicago, seems to specialize in reinventing himself. By all accounts, he grew up on middle-class South Shore Drive, but he has told reporters that he lived in the South Side ghetto. He was an uninspired student who never received a college degree but would maintain something of an obsession with the University of Chicago and imply he had an advanced degree in physics. Ellison is also an indifferent student of language but has arranged his home with all the trappings of a Japanese lord, and a few boats and helicopters to boot. These grand inconsistencies--delightful to some, horribly irritating to others, including many former employees--go a long way to explaining Ellison's unbelievable success at marketing his Oracle database software, used by thousands of companies. One employee, a devout Mormon named Rick Bennett, even considered his ubiquitous software akin to ``an instrument of God'' and believed Ellison pivotal to modern-day Mormonism. Wilson, an investigative reporter for the St. Petersburg Times, wisely focuses much of the attention on Ellison's one-sided feud with Bill Gates (who views Ellison as something of a gadfly but doesn't mention his name at all in his book, The Road Ahead) and documents his obsession nicely. He also does a fair job of explaining Ellison's vision for the NC, an inexpensive computer that provides quick access to the Internet and stores all of its software on a network server, rather than on a hard drive. While some in the computer business see the NC as the future computer for schools, many others see it as a $500 empty box and a poor attempt to topple Microsoft. While the title is the funniest line of the book, this is an engaging, humanizing look at a Silicon Valley megalomaniac. (8 pages b&w photos) -- Copyright ©1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

  One funny thing happened soon after I finished the book.slang1@hotmail.comThe author tried the address the book as a novel, skipping around in time and making it difficult to follow.BertIt's really a funny book to me when I try to learn more about this Silicon Valley outspoken playboy.Kwok Ching Kwong
  It's a very good book in terms of the history of the computing giants that shaped the world. It kept my attention long enough to dedicate 2 days to reading it cover to cover. As an Oracle programmer, it helped me understand some of the thoughts I had of the company since working with their product since the early 90's.The author tried the address the book as a novel, skipping around in time and making it difficult to follow. You go from 1977 to 1989 to 1991 to 1984 to 1996 to ... (you get what I mean). Confusing.This is the type of book that needed to be more linear in timeline or overlapping in timeline, but not arranged the way it was. Still, very enjoyable and worth the read for those that enjoy the behind the scenes action that shaped technology as we know it today.
7 of 7 people found the following review helpfulGreat history of Oracle from many different perspectives
  Yes, I liked it. As an Oracle UK employee it filled in information on many  of the myths that float around the company. It would make good reading for  anyone who would like to get an insight into what drives Larry and how he  views himself (and wants others to view him as well).The book is well  written but compared to other biographies that I have read, does not  capture and hold the reader. I found some of the chapters very hard going  (particularly the discussions of in depth finance) but others held my  attention well.The book is worth reading merely for the information that  it contains from realtives, friends and even interviews with Larry.
  I found out about this book in an Oracle training class two years ago but put off reading it until now.  THIS BOOK KNOCKED MY SOCKS OFF!  The most fascinating thing about this story was that I had witnessed almost all the book's events in my own experiences working for other high-tech startup  companies here in the Denver area.  I was constantly saying to myself, as I  read, "That's exactly what happened when I was working at (fill in the  blank) Inc!". The same personalities (some even worse), the same  marketing pressures, the same technical problems, the same product support  problems, the same legal problems, the same IPOs, and some of the same  rewards (but I didn't receive as many stock options ;^).I would HIGHLY  recommend this book to any (technical) person who is considering working  for a high-tech startup for the first time.  This is the greatest and most  accurate tale (at least in my experience) that is available of day-to-day  life in a startup company.  Some of the stuff that happens at these types  of companies is SO WEIRD that you usually have to see it for yourself to  believe it. This book gives a VERY GOOD look at "the weird  stuff".
  Having worked for Oracle as a technical support rep, back when there were only five of us in the US and seven worldwide (we kept our support database on paper because the database was too slow and prone to corruption!), I too  recommend book."The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison"  is a 'must-read' for anyone considering  buying a relational database  management system, working in the industry, or for anyone who is simply  wants to mercilessly crush their competition with mediocre products and  high pressure sales tactics. Larry Ellison makes Machievelli look like  Saint Francis. However, like Ghengis Khan, you have to admire his  accomplishments.
  A fascinating read, but I was quite surprised to  find no discussion of Attention Deficit Disorder  in this book.  Much of Mr. Ellison's behavior is quite 'understandable' assuming he 'suffers from' / 'is blessed with' ADD.  Read 'Driven to Distraction' along with this book and see if you agree.
  I always recommend this book to people starting their own firms when they ask me what they should do to build their business. I like this book because it gives a glimpse at what really goes on out there instead of motivational BS so many books throw around. Before Oracle, Larry was working at another firm but he wanted to set up his own company. He stayed at his job but rented an office in the same building to launch his own firm at the same time without telling anybody. I thought that was brilliant. He would ride the elevator a few floors to his own firm but still have access to the resources of the larger company while maintaining his salary and building his business the whole time.Academics are always shocked when I mention what really goes on in the business world and this book gives an up close look.
  The book flows well, is interesting to read, and gives good insight into Larry Ellison himself as well as Oracle.  There is considerable background material that all seems relevant as the book progresses.  Ellison was interviewed 4 times for this book, and while the book reflects overall a favorable opinion of him, it also seems very truthful and frank.  I gained a better insight of the software and database industry from reading the book.  Was also helpful in analyzing Ellison and his leadership strategies.
  I found the book a fairly easy read.  It was informative and each quote was marked with a 'who said it' reference in the back of the book. The book paints a grand picture of Larry but also gives you the sense that you may not want to buy a used car from him. Overall the book gives you the insight that Larry got to be a billionaire due to a crafty ability to sell to people, and a complete determination to win. Many of the stories within the book are interesting and entertaining even if some of them may be fabrications of the people who told them. I recommend this book if you know anything about Larry and Oracle already.
      Is Ellison this boring?  I had heard good things about this book but it reads like a piece in the NYT Book Review.
      Very entertaining and easy to read. The author doesn't get into meticulous technical details, but instead creates a coupling story about the life of Larry Ellison and the success...
      This was a great book about a fascinating man and his company.  Ellison is driven, unethical, intelligent, erratic - makes for a very interesting read.
      This is a fascinating book about one of the most interesting technology giants alive today.  Really makes you realize that where you come from still affects you much later on in...
      I must say that I am a fan of the Oracle CEO and founder.  When Mr. Ellison puts his mind and wealth to a project or a cause magical things happen.
      I purchased this book to read for part of my research for a paper I wrote on the entrepreneurial success of Larry Ellison.
      Could not stop reading this book, but it sure seems like a smear campaign against Ellison at times. However, I do think that the book presents genuine and honest feedback from...
      I absoultly loved this book. I am currently recieving my MBA, and it gave me a whole new perspective about how busniess can be, how it can suceed, and fail.
      Okay, so who is this guy Larry Ellison? He's the man behind Oracle, one of the world's largest software companies.
      This book was a great read, and it was a blast reading about the great Larry Ellison. Larry Ellison's personality comes out in this book.

Founder and CEO of the world’s largest business software company Mr. Larry Ellison is not only one of the world’s richest persons alive but is also one of the most flamboyant and outspoken of the lot. A cavalier business personality, he knows how to dress for occasions with his tailor made Italian suits and shirts making him look as if he was born to be a billionaire. Ellison was born to an unwed 19 year old mother. When he was just nine months, her mother gave his child to be adopted by her aunt and uncle in Chicago.
It was 48 long years, before Ellison met his biological mother. In 1977, Ellison and his two colleagues Robert Miner and Ed Oates found a company called Software Development Labs, where they came across a paper called “A Relational Model of Data for large Shared Data Banks, which became the basis of their soon-to-be-found fortune. His prime came in 2000, when for a brief period of time he left behind Bill Gates to become the richest person in the world. Other than the humongous amount of wealth that he has, Ellison is known as a quite multi faceted character: a brusque businessman, marketing genius and a playboy. Owing to his voracious appetite for new estates, he has been tagged as the newest trophy buyer in the country.
He follows a simple approach, “Buy the best, without compromise”. The scores of properties he has includes two holdings in Woodside, California, a hotel and two restaurants in Malibu along with two other homes, a 249-acre state in Palm Springs, which he got for $49 million and a garden property in Kyoto Japan worth at least $86 million. Ellison has a penchant for adventures, sailing and outdoor sports that has cost him more than a few million dollars and made him rivals with a few fellow billionaires (read Paul Allen). He has two grown children, Megan and David, both dabbling in the movie business, and is recently divorced from his most recent wife, romance novelist Melanie Craft.
"A corporation's primary goal is to make money. Government's primary role is to take a big chunk of that money and give it to others."
"Bill Gates wants people to think he's Edison, when he's really Rockefeller. Referring to Gates as the smartest man in America isn't right... wealth isn't the same thing as intelligence."
"“If an innovative piece of software comes along, Microsoft copies it and makes it part of Windows, ... This is not innovation. This is the end of innovation.”"
""Everyone thought the acquisition strategy was extremely risky because no one had ever done it successfully. In other words, it was innovative.""
""I think after a certain amount, I’m going to give almost everything I have to charity. What else can you do with it? You can't spend it, even if you try. I've been trying.""
"“We will still be enormously profitable and by far the most profitable enterprise software company.”"
""What they're doing is not the least bit subtle. The result of all the innovation will be bankruptcy for Netscape,""
""I've never experienced anything remotely like this. It's been a very emotional experience to get here. This is not what this is supposed to be about. A lot of us are upset.""
""Microsoft isn't good at security. We're good at that and I don't think sending a memo is going to help,""
