Justin Drew Bieber (/ˈbiːbər/; born March 1, 1994)[4][5] is a Canadian singer-songwriter, dancer, and actor.[6][2] Marketing executive, Scooter Braun first discovered Bieber through his videos in 2007.[7] Braun was impressed with the videos, and contacted Bieber's mother Pattie about wanting to work with him. After convincing Bieber's mother, Braun arranged for Bieber to meet with Usher Raymond IV in Atlanta, Georgia. Bieber was signed to RBMG,[8] and then to an Island Records recording contract offered by record executive, L.A. Reid.[3][9]
Bieber released his debut EP, My World, in November 2009. It was certified platinum in the United States. He became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut record to chart on the Billboard Hot 100.[10] Bieber released his first full-length studio album, My World 2.0, in March 2010. It debuted at or near number one in several countries and was certified platinum in the United States. It was preceded by the single "Baby". He followed up the release of his debut album with his first headlining tour, the My World Tour, the remix albums My Worlds Acoustic and Never Say Never – The Remixes, and the 3D biopic-concert film Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. Bieber released his second studio album Under the Mistletoe in November 2011, when it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Bieber released his third studio album Believe in June 2012. It became his fourth chart topper in the United States, debuting at number-one on the Billboard 200.
Bieber has received numerous awards, including both Artist of the Year Awards, at the 2010 American Music Awards, and the 2012 American Music Awards, and was nominated for Best New Artist and Best Pop Vocal Album at the 53rd Grammy Awards. With a global fan base, termed as "Beliebers", and over 40 million followers on Twitter, he was named by Forbes magazine in 2012 as the third-most powerful celebrity in the world.[11] However Bieber fell to number 9 on the list in 2013.[12]
Bieber was born on March 1, 1994, in London, Ontario, at St Joseph's Hospital,[13] and was raised in Stratford, Ontario.[14] He is the son of Jeremy Jack Bieber and Patricia "Pattie" Mallette. Bieber's parents were never married.[15] Pattie raised her son with the help of her mother, Diane, and stepfather, Bruce.[16] His mother is of French descent; his paternal great-grandfather was of German ancestry, and his other roots are English and Irish.[17][18][19] He has stated that he believes that he has some undetermined Aboriginal Canadian ancestry.[20]
Through Jeremy, Bieber has two younger half-siblings, Jasmyn (born 2009) and Jaxon (born 2010).[21] Pattie worked a series of low-paying office jobs, raising Bieber as a single mother in low-income housing. Bieber has maintained contact with his father.[22]
Bieber attended a French-language immersion elementary school in Stratford, the Jeanne Sauvé Catholic School.[16] Growing up, he learnt to play the piano, drums, guitar, and trumpet.[14][23] In early 2007, aged 12, Bieber sang Ne-Yo's "So Sick" for a local singing competition in Stratford and was placed second.[23][24] Mallette posted a video of the performance on YouTube for their family and friends to see. She continued to upload videos of Bieber singing covers of various R&B songs, and Bieber's popularity on the site grew.[9]
While searching for videos of a different singer, Scooter Braun, a former marketing executive of So So Def, clicked on one of Bieber's 2007 videos by accident. Impressed, Braun tracked down the theater Bieber was performing in, located Bieber's school, and finally contacted Mallette, who was reluctant because of Braun's Judaism. She remembered praying, "God, I gave him to you. You could send me a Christian man, a Christian label!" and "God, you don't want this Jewish kid to be Justin's man, do you?" However, church elders convinced her to let Bieber go with Braun. At 13, Bieber went to Atlanta, Georgia, with Braun to record demo tapes.[22] Bieber began signing for Usher one week later.[25]
Bieber was soon signed to Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG), a joint venture between Braun and Usher.[8] Justin Timberlake was also reportedly in the running to sign Bieber, but lost the bidding war to Usher.[8][26] Usher then sought assistance in finding a label home for the artist from then manager Chris Hicks, who helped engineer an audition with his contact L.A. Reid of The Island Def Jam Music Group.[27] Reid signed Bieber to Island Records in October 2008 (resulting in a joint venture between RBMG and Island Records) and appointed Hicks as executive Vice-President of Def Jam where he would be able to manage Bieber's career at the label.[3][8][9][27] Bieber then moved to Atlanta with his mother to pursue further work with Braun and Usher.[8] Braun became Bieber's manager in 2008.[9]
Bieber's first single, "One Time", was released to radio while Bieber was still recording his debut album.[28] The song reached number 12 on the Canadian Hot 100 during its first week of release in July 2009,[9] and later peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100. During fall 2009, it had success in international markets.[29] The song was certified Platinum in Canada and the US and Gold in Australia and New Zealand.[30][31][32] His first release, an extended play entitled My World, was released on November 17, 2009. The album's second single, "One Less Lonely Girl", and two promo singles, "Love Me", and "Favorite Girl", were released exclusively on the iTunes Store and charted within the top forty of the Billboard Hot 100.[29] "One Less Lonely Girl" was later also released to radio and peaked within the top fifteen in Canada and the US, being certified Gold in the latter.[29] My World was eventually certified Platinum in the US and Double Platinum in both Canada and the United Kingdom.[33][34] To promote the album, Bieber performed on several live shows such as mtvU's VMA 09 Tour, European program The Dome, YTV's The Next Star, The Today Show,[35][36] The Wendy Williams Show, Lopez Tonight, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, It's On with Alexa Chung, Good Morning America, Chelsea Lately, and BET's 106 & Park with Rihanna. Bieber also guest starred in an episode of True Jackson, VP in late 2009.
Bieber performed Stevie Wonder's "Someday at Christmas" for U.S. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama at the White House for Christmas in Washington, which was broadcast on December 20, 2009, on US television broadcaster TNT.[37] Bieber was also one of the performers at Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest on December 31, 2009.[38] Bieber was a presenter at the 52nd Grammy Awards on January 31, 2010. He was invited to be a vocalist for the remake of "We Are the World" (a song written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie) for its 25th anniversary to benefit Haiti after the earthquake. Bieber sings the opening line, which was sung by Lionel Richie in the original version.[39]
On March 12, 2010, a version of K'naan's "Wavin' Flag" recorded by a collective of Canadian musicians known as Young Artists for Haiti was released. Bieber is featured in the song, performing the closing lines.[40]
In January 2010, "Baby", was released from his debut album, My World 2.0. The song featured Ludacris, and became an international hit. It charted at number five on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, peaked at number three on the Canadian Hot 100[41] and reached the top ten in several international markets.[29] Two promo singles "Never Let You Go", and "U Smile" were top thirty hits on the U.S. Hot 100, and top twenty hits in Canada.[29] According to review aggregator Metacritic, the album has received "generally favorable reviews".[42] It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, making Bieber the youngest solo male act to top the chart since Stevie Wonder in 1963.[43] My World 2.0 also debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, Irish Albums Chart, Australian Albums Chart, and the New Zealand Albums Chart[29] and reached the top ten of fifteen other countries.[44][45]
To promote the album, Bieber appeared on several live programs including The View, the 2010 Kids Choice Awards, Nightline, Late Show with David Letterman, The Dome and 106 & Park.[46] Sean Kingston appeared on the album's next single, "Eenie Meenie". The song reached the top ten in the United Kingdom and Australia, and the top-twenty of most other markets. On April 10, 2010, Bieber was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live.[47] On July 4, 2010, Bieber performed at the Macy's Fourth of July Fireworks Spectacular in New York City.[48] The following single from My World 2.0, "Somebody to Love", was released in April 2010, and a remix was released featuring Bieber's mentor Usher. On June 23, 2010, Bieber went on his first official headlining tour, the My World Tour, starting in Hartford, Connecticut, to promote My World and My World 2.0. In July 2010, it was reported that Bieber was the most searched for celebrity on the Internet.[49] That same month his music video for "Baby", surpassed Lady Gaga's "Bad Romance" to become the most viewed, and most disliked YouTube video ever.[50][51] In September 2010, it was reported that Bieber accounted for three percent of all traffic on Twitter, according to an employee of the social-networking site.[52]
In Bieber's second album, because of puberty, his voice was deeper than it was in his first album.[53] In April 2010, the singer discussing his vocals remarked, "It cracks. Like every teenage boy, I'm dealing with it and I have the best vocal coach in the world. [...] Some of the notes I hit on "Baby" I can't hit anymore. We have to lower the key when I sing live."[54] Bieber guest-starred in the season premiere of the CBS crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which aired on September 23, 2010. He played a "troubled teen who is faced with a difficult decision regarding his only brother", who is also a serial bomber. Bieber was also in a subsequent episode which aired on February 17, 2011, in which his character is killed.[55] Bieber performed a medley of "U Smile", "Baby", and "Somebody to Love" and briefly played the drums at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010.[56] Bieber announced in October 2010 that he would be releasing an acoustic album, called My Worlds Acoustic.[57] It was released on November 26, 2010 in the United States and featured acoustic versions of songs from his previous albums, and accompanied the release of a completely new song titled "Pray".[58]
A 3-D part-biopic, part-concert film starring Bieber entitled Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, was released on February 11, 2011, directed by Step Up 3D director Jon Chu. It topped the box office with an estimated gross of $12.4 million on its opening day from 3,105 theaters.[59] It grossed $30.3 million for the weekend and was narrowly beaten by the romantic comedy Just Go with It, which grossed $31 million.[60] Never Say Never reportedly exceeded industry expectations, nearly matching the $31.1 million grossed by Miley Cyrus's 2008 3-D concert film, Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert, which holds the record for the top debut for a music-documentary.[61] Never Say Never grossed a total of $98,441,954 worldwide.[62] The film is accompanied by his second remix album, Never Say Never – The Remixes, released February 14, 2011, and features remixes of songs from his debut album, with guest appearances from Miley Cyrus, Chris Brown, and Kanye West, among others.[63]
In June 2011, Bieber was ranked #2 on the Forbes list of Best-Paid Celebrities under 30. He is the youngest star, and 1 of 7 musicians on the list, having raked in $53 million in a 12-month period.[64] On November 1, 2011, Bieber released Under the Mistletoe, his second studio album. It debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200, selling 210,000 copies in its first week of release.[65]
In late 2011, Bieber began recording his third studio album, entitled Believe. The following week, Bieber appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to announce that the first single would be called "Boyfriend" and would be released on March 26, 2012.[66] The song debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, selling a total of 521,000 digital units, the second-highest-ever debut digital sales week.[67] Bill Werde of Billboard noted that it failed to debut at number one because the digital download of the track was available only through iTunes Store, "restricting the buying option for those that do not frequent the Apple retail store."[68] "Boyfriend" became Bieber's first single ever to reach the top position on the Canadian Hot 100 by debuting at number one and staying on for one week.[67]
His third studio album, Believe was released on June 19, 2012, by Island Records. The album marks a musical departure from the teen pop sound of his previous releases, and incorporates elements of dance-pop and R&B genres. Intent on developing a more "mature" sound, Bieber collaborated with a wide range of urban producers for the release as well as some long-time collaborators, including Darkchild, Hit-Boy, Diplo, and Max Martin. Entertainment Weekly praised Bieber's musical shift, calling the album both a "reinvention and a reintroduction."[69] Rolling Stone noted the deeper voice and more "intense" beats found on the album, although it lampooned one of his euphemisms for newfound sexual maturity ("If you spread your wings, you can fly away with me").[70] Believe debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming his fourth number-one album.[71][72][73] The album sold 57,000 copies in its first week in Canada, debuting atop the Canadian Albums Chart.[74]
The Believe Tour, which further promoted the album, began in September 2012 in Glendale, Arizona.[75] On December 14, 2012, Bieber appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where he announced plans to release an acoustic album titled Believe Acoustic, which was released on January 29, 2013.[76]
On March 7, 2013, Bieber fainted backstage at London's O2 Arena after complaining of breathing problems throughout his performance and was taken to hospital.[77] Bieber cancelled his second Lisbon, Portugal concert at the Pavilhão Atlântico, which was to be held on March 12, due to low ticket sales. The concert on March 11 went on.[78] In mid-August 2013, a remixed duet version of Michael Jackson's previously unreleased song "Slave To The Rhythm", featuring Justin Bieber leaked online.[79] Later, a song titled "Twerk" by rapper Lil Twist, featuring Bieber as well as Miley Cyrus, also leaked.[80]
On October 3, 2013, Bieber announced that he would release a new song every Monday for 10 weeks as a lead-up to the film Justin Bieber's Believe, which entered production in May 2012 and was released on December 25, 2013. The film is a follow-up to Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, and Jon M. Chu returned to direct.[81][82][83] The first song of Music Mondays, "Heartbreaker", was released on October 7. The second song, "All That Matters", was released on October 14, followed by "Hold Tight" on October 21, "Recovery" on October 28, "Bad Day" on November 4, and "All Bad" on November 11. The seventh song, "PYD" featuring R. Kelly, was released on November 18; it was followed by "Roller Coaster" on November 25, and "Change Me" on December 2. The final song, "Confident" featuring Chance The Rapper, was released on December 9, 2013. That same day, it was announced that all 10 tracks will be featured on an upcoming collection called Journals. It reportedly featured five additional unreleased songs, a music video for "All That Matters", and a trailer for Believe. Journals was only available for purchase via iTunes for a limited time only: from December 23, 2013 to January 9, 2014. The titles of the five new additional songs are: "One Life", "Backpack" featuring Lil Wayne, "What's Hatinin" featuring Future, "Swap It Out", and "Memphis" featuring Big Sean and Diplo.[84]
Usher commented that while he and Bieber were both signed at the same age, "I had the chance to ramp up my success, where this has happened to Bieber abruptly." As a result, Usher, Braun, Bieber's bodyguard and other adults surrounding Bieber constantly coach him on handling fame and his public image.[22] After signing Bieber, Usher appointed one of his former assistants, Ryan Good, to be Bieber's road manager and stylist. Good, once nicknamed Bieber's "swagger coach", created a "streetwise look" for the singer which consisted of baseball caps, hoodies, dog chains and flashy sneakers. Amy Kaufman of The Los Angeles Times comments, "Though a product of a middle-class suburban upbringing in Stratford, Ontario, Bieber's manner of dress and speech ("Wassup man, how you doin'?" or "It's like, you know, whateva' ") suggest he's mimicking his favorite rappers."[85]
Bieber is often featured in teen magazines such as Tiger Beat,[22] and has been labeled as a "teen heartthrob".[86] Wax statues of Bieber are on display at Madame Tussauds wax museums in New York, Amsterdam, and London.[87] His change of hairstyle in 2010, and the consequent alterations to Bieber products, led to it being called "the most expensive musical haircut of all time".[88]
In 2010, Bieber was frequently criticized for looking and sounding younger than his age,[89] and the following year for his androgynous appearance, which has been frequently noted in the media, including when he appeared on the cover of LOVE magazine's androgyny issue in 2011.[90] His teen-pop music, image (especially as a heart-throb to young teenage girls), and the media attention he receives have additionally been criticized,[89] and he has been a frequent target of Internet bloggers and message board posters, notably by users of Internet message board 4chan and users of YouTube.[91] Nick Collins of The Daily Telegraph said that "Bieber's character appears to strike a particularly sour note with his Internet critics" who have questioned his manner of speech, among other things.[89]
His fanbase is known as "Beliebers", which the Chicago Tribune included as one of the top buzzwords of 2010.[92] Bieber's early fanbase developed on YouTube, and predated the release of Bieber's first album.[93][94] Bieber's management team makes an effort to mobilize and coordinate Bieber's fans into taking actions related to Bieber, such as greeting him at airports.[95]
In May 2013, a poll by Public Policy Polling found that Bieber's favorability ratings among Americans were 20% positive, 26% mixed and 54% negative.[96][97] Bieber's first arrest in January 2014, coupled with a string of brushes with the law and controversial incidents in 2013, led to comments that his image has been transformed from "boy-next-door" to "bad boy".[98][99][100] In March 2014, Bieber's win of the fans' choice prize at the Juno Awards received a mix of cheers and boos from the Canadian audience.[101][102]
Bieber has had several run-ins with the law around the world before his first arrest in 2014,[98][99] including when he was accused of reckless driving in his neighborhood in 2012 and charged in Brazil with vandalism in 2013.[98][103] On January 23, 2014, Bieber was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida together with singer Khalil, on suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI), driving with an (over six month) expired licence and resisting arrest without violence.[104][105][106] Police said that Bieber told authorities he had consumed alcohol, smoked marijuana and taken prescription drugs.[98] Bieber was released on a $2,500 bond.[107] A toxicology report revealed that Bieber had THC (a component in marijuana) and the anti-anxiety medication Xanax in his system at the time of his arrest.[108][109] On January 29, Bieber surrendered to the Toronto Police Services, who charged him with assaulting a limousine driver in Toronto on December 30, 2013.[110][111][112]
Bieber's voice marked the transition from his puberty to adulthood, as his voice gradually matured to a high tenor.[113][114][115] Bieber was heavily influenced by Michael Jackson, Usher, Ne-Yo, Boys II Men, Stevie Wonder, Justin Timberlake, New Kids on the Block, Tupac, and The Beatles.[116][117]
According to Jan Hoffman of The New York Times, part of Bieber's appeal stems from his YouTube channel. Long before the November 2009 release of the EP, My World, his YouTube videos attracted millions of views.[22] Braun recognized the appeal. Before flying him to Atlanta, Braun wanted to "build him up more on YouTube first" and had Bieber record more home videos for the channel. "I said: 'Justin, sing like there’s no one in the room. But let's not use expensive cameras.' We'll give it to kids, let them do the work, so that they feel like it's theirs", recalled Braun.[22] Bieber continues to upload videos to the same channel and has opened a Twitter account, from which he interacts with fans regularly;[9] his account was reported in November 2010 to have more than six million followers.[118] Bieber surpassed Lady Gaga for having the most followed person on Twitter in January 2013. In early November 2013, Katy Perry surpassed him for having the most followers.[119]
Bieber was frequently a trending topic on Twitter when the feature first launched[120] because his fans frequently discussed him on the network,[121] and he was named the top trending star on Twitter in 2010;[122] Klout gave his account a score of 100.[123][124] In April 2013, the social media analysis company Socialbakers concluded that 16.7 million of Bieber's 37 million Twitter followers are not genuine.[125][126]
Bieber identifies as a Christian, and has said he believes he has a relationship with Jesus, that he talks to him and that "he's the reason I'm here".[127] Bieber reflects his faith in a rap video with Brandon Burke titled #iPledge, in which he "talks candidly about his appreciation for the tenet of forgiveness in the Christian faith."[128] Regarding sexual abstinence, Bieber told Rolling Stone in 2010: "I don't think you should have sex with anyone unless you love them." He added that he does not "believe in abortion" and that it is "like killing a baby".[129][130] He described sexual orientation as "everyone's own decision,"[131] and has contributed to the It Gets Better Project,[132] which aims to prevent suicide among LGBT youth.[133]
Now residing in the United States on an O-1 visa,[134] Bieber has said he is not interested in obtaining U.S. citizenship and has criticized America's health care system. Praising Canada as being "the best country in the world", he cited its health care system as a model example.[129] According to Scooter Braun, Bieber says the Jewish prayer Shema Yisrael before every show he gives.[135] Bieber started dating actress and singer Selena Gomez in December 2010.[136][137] In January 2013, it was reported that Bieber and Gomez had ended their relationship.[138][139]
Aside from his career as a musician, Bieber has also ventured into the business world by becoming a venture capitalist and technology investor. Bieber made his first startup investment in 2009. Since then, he has been quietly investing millions of dollars in a dozen small technology start ups that include Stamped, Spotify, Shots, and game-for-good company SoJo Studios. He has said that he is not going to invest in something he does not like, as he has to believe in the product.[140][141] Bieber endorsed Adidas beside Derrick Rose and Venus Williams in 2012.[142]
Bieber supports Pencils of Promise,[143] a charity founded by Adam Braun, the younger brother of Bieber's manager. The organization builds schools in developing countries, and Bieber became manager for the organization's campaign in Guatemala. He currently serves as a celebrity spokesman for the organization[144] by running ads for the charity and its campaign "Schools4All",[145][146] and promising to visit schools that donate the most funds to the organization.[147] He takes part in the charity's fund-raising galas and donates parts of the proceeds from his concerts and line of fragrances "Someday"[148] and various merchandising to the charity. Bieber appeared in an animal welfare PSA for PETA encouraging people to volunteer at and adopt from animal shelters instead of buying pets from breeders or pet stores.[149] Bieber himself adopted a papillon named Sam from a shelter.[150]

=======================================================
2006Bieber BeginningsAt 12, Bieber – who teaches himself to play piano, trumpet and guitar in his native Stratford, Ontario – places second in a local talent competition. His single mom Patricia Mallette uploads the footage of his performance on YouTube for family and friends to watch, but the video attracts strangers as well.2007Ruling the 'TubeSoon after, YouTubers request Bieber to sing songs, and his covers of Usher, Justin Timberlake and Chris Brown attract an online following. "People always say, 'Did you try to get famous off YouTube?' I'm like, 'Not at all,'" Bieber tells PEOPLE. "I was just doing it for fun." Meanwhile, Atlanta-based music exec Scooter Braun discovers Bieber's YouTube channel. "My gut was going crazy," Braun recalls. "So I tracked him down."
Ushered ThroughNow Bieber's manager, Braun flies the young singer and his mom to Atlanta, where he records demos and more YouTube videos, grabbing the attention of both Usher and Timberlake who are interested in signing Bieber. Eventually, Usher prevails, signing Bieber to Island Def Jam records. "His voice was magical and his personality was so keen," says Usher, adding, "Sometimes he's like a little brother or a son to me."2009'Blast' OffWith "swagger coaching" by Usher and his online followers behind him, Bieber releases his first album, My World, which debuts at No. 6 on the Billboard charts on the strength of his single, "One Time." "What I have is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," Bieber tells PEOPLE. "And I'm having a blast."2010SpringThe Big TimeAfter opening for Taylor Swift, singing for the Obamas, and topping the albums charts with My World 2.0, Bieber makes his cover debut on PEOPLE. "I have so many things, but where'd this come from?" Bieber marvels of his stardom. "Out of nowhere. Someone, like, pinch me."
Bieber Fever!Bieber amasses more than 5 million fans and counting on Facebook and Twitter, which is reminiscent of another fan-driven pop presence. "It's like Beatlemania," says Bieber's road manager and stylist Ryan Good. "Mass hysteria. Loud screaming, crying, passing out. It's amazing." The tween dream's fans are so fanatic that a Twitpic of Bieber with Kim Kardashian, garnered the reality star death threats. "Ladies calm down," he wrote. "No need 4 threats. Let's all be friends and hang out often."2011JanuaryK-I-S-S-I-N-GAfter playing coy about his romance with Selena Gomez, Bieber and the Disney star are caught kissing during a Caribbean vacation in St. Lucia. "She's really cool. She's an amazing person," he told MTV News in December, adding, "I gotta keep some things to myself."February 11'Never Say Never'Bieber makes his big screen debut (and takes himself 3D!) with his performance documentary, Never Say Never, which follows his Canadian beginnings to his sold-out concert at Madison Square Garden. "I wanted people to know that I'm not just some product, that I'm just a regular person, and I've been a musician my whole life," he tells The New York Times of his film, which takes in $30 million, just a million shy of toppling Jennifer Aniston's No. 1 flick, Just Go With It.2012NovemberBoyfriend No MoreAfter almost two years of dating, Bieber and Gomez part ways amid speculation about their rocky romance, which included cryptic Twitter posts, breakup rumors and sightings of the Canadian pop star with other women in recent months. "I don't know really what's even going on in my life," he says as word of the split breaks. "To even assess that doesn't make sense."2013May 19Second TryFollowing months of on-again, off-again speculation, Bieber and Gomez reunite for the Billboard Music Awards, where they share a kiss and sit next to each other in the audience. But by fall, the reconciliation proves short-lived, and the couple parts ways again.

        Canadian pop singer Justin Bieber was barely into his teens when he released his 2009 debut, My World, and became one of the youngest success stories in contemporary pop when it sold a whopping five million copies worldwide. For the next three years, successive releases -- including remix compilations, acoustic sets, a documentary tie-in, a Christmas album, and even some proper studio recordings -- shot forth at a dizzying rate. Bieber's developed a massive global following, named Beliebers. During the 2010s, his recording activity slowed, and he had more of a presence on celebrity gossip websites than on sales charts.  A native of Stratford, Ontario, Bieber placed second in a local 2007 singing competition and began posting his performances on YouTube. The videos caught the attention of Scooter Braun, a talent agent and former So So Def marketing executive, who helped Bieber land an impromptu audition with the R&B star Usher. Impressed by what he saw, Usher -- along with Island/Def Jam chairman L.A. Reid -- quickly signed the 15-year-old Bieber to a recording contract. Bieber released his first single, "One Time," in May 2009. Supported by a popular video that featured an appearance by Usher, "One Time" went platinum in both Canada and America, a feat that was replicated later that year with the release of My World. The disc was technically an EP, featuring only seven songs, but it reached number six on the Billboard 200 album chart and sold over a million copies. Less than a year after his debut, Bieber returned with the "second half" of My World, a ten-song release titled My World 2.0. Further demonstrating his and his management's marketing power, over 8,000 fans who pre-ordered My World 2.0 had their head shots used in a photo mosaic (formed to look like a portrait of Bieber) that was displayed on the back side of the disc's booklet. The release topped the Billboard 200. A few weeks later, a combination of My World and My World 2.0, titled My Worlds, appeared in some territories. By the end of 2010, Bieber issued My Worlds Acoustic, a set featuring acoustic versions of nine songs off the My World discs, as well as one new song. The following February, the 3-D documentary Never Say Never was released to theaters. The seven-track Never Say Never: The Remixes, released just days after the film, maintained the flow of Bieber product, and featured appearances from the likes of Kanye West, Usher, and Miley Cyrus. Just in time for Christmas 2011 came the holiday-themed Under the Mistletoe, complete with several celebrity guest duets and an original song, "Mistletoe," for the first single, which entered the Holiday Songs chart at number two. In 2012, Bieber returned with the proper follow-up to My World 2.0, titled Believe. With a sound based in dance and R&B, it featured production from Darkchild, Diplo, and Max Martin. Believe became his fourth number one album, paced by Top Ten hits for "Boyfriend," "As Long as You Love Me" (featuring Big Sean), and "Beauty and a Beat" (featuring Nicki Minaj). Believe Acoustic, a sequel to My Worlds Acoustic, followed in 2013. Late that year, Bieber released the first in a weekly series of singles. Nearly all of them charted, led by Top 40 showings for "All Around the World" (featuring Ludacris) and "Heartbreaker." Those songs, as well as others, were compiled for release as Journals, an album that failed to chart. He also released a concert film for Christmas 2013, Justin Bieber's Believe. ~ Matt Collar & Andy Kellman, Rovi

Justin Bieber (born Justin Drew is a Canadian singer, dancer, rapper, songwriter and actor. He was discovered by manager Scooter Braun and soon became the protégé of singer Usher. Bieber’s single “Baby” is the second-most-viewed video on YouTube ever and boosted sales of his double platinum debut full-length album, 2010′s My World 2.0. He followed that record with a concert documentary titled Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. Bieber then released a holiday album, Under The Mistletoe. He released his third studio album, Believe, in 2012. Outside of music, Justin has drawn a massive amount of publicity for his on-off relationship with singer/actress Selena Gomez.
Justin Bieber began dating Selena Gomez in 2011. After cheating rumors involving Victoria’s Secret model Barbara Palvin, the couple split for good in January 2013. Justin and Selena have since attempted to reunite, but nothing full-blown has ever materialized.

Then on Jan. 23, 2014, Justin was arrested for DUI and drag racing in Miami, Fla. Less than a week later, Justin was charged with assault for allegedly attacking his limo driver while in Toronto on Jan. 28, 2014.

(The Richest, 2013)Justin Bieber: ChildhoodJustin Bieber was raised by his mother, Pattie Mallette, in Ontario, Canada. At the age of 12, he entered a local singing competition and came second. Bieber went on to teach himself to play the guitar, drums and the trumpet.With the help of his mother, Bieber then started to post videos on YouTube of his own covers of songs by artists such as Chris Brown, Usher, Justin Timberlake and Stevie Wonder. These videos were seen by the record company executive Scooter Braun, who flew Bieber to Atlanta to meet and perform in front of Usher. Eventually, he was signed to Island Records. Bieber moved to Atlanta with his mother, so that Justin could work more closely with Usher and Braun.Justin Bieber: Music CareerJustin Bieber's debut album was entitled My World and was released in November 2009. Usher appears as a guest vocalist on the album and also appears in the video for 'One Time'. The track reached number on in Canada and also experienced global success. 'One Time' was followed by the release of singles such as 'One Less Lonely Girl', 'Love Me' and 'Favourite Girl'.During a promotional tour, Justin Bieber was due to appear at a shopping mall in Long Island, but the visit had to be cancelled when an unexpected crowd of over 3,000 turned up and threatened to breach safety restrictions. A number of Bieber's fans suffered minor injuries n the foray that ensued. The vice-president of Island Records was arrested over the incident, as he was reported to have disadvantaged the police's crowd control efforts. Similarly, Scooter Braun was charged with reckless endangerment and criminal nuisance in relation to the event.At the Christmas in Washington event, Justin Bieber performed for the US President, Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama. He sang 'Someday at Christmas', by Stevie Wonder. A few weeks later, Justin Bieber was one of the guests on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest, along with The Black Eyed Peas and Jennifer Lopez. Bieber was also chosen as a presenter at the 52nd Grammy Awards.Bieber was also asked to perform on the re-recording of 'We Are the World', which was sold to raise money for victims of the Haiti earthquake. Among the huge number of artists on the recording were Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers, Akon, T-Pain, Kanye West and Miley Cyrus.Justin Bieber's track 'Baby', released in early 2010, features the hip-hop artist Ludacris. In April of that year, Bieber was a guest on Saturday Night Live and was the subject of a comedy skit featuring himself and regular Saturday Night Live comedian Tina Fey.
He released a follow-up to 'My World' entitled 'My World 2.0' in 2010 which top the charts in several countries including the US and Canada. He promoted the release with appearances on 'The View', the 2010 'Kids Choice Awards' and 'The Late Show with David Letterman' among others. Later that year he was a musical guest on 'Saturday Night Live' and he also went on his first headline tour 'the My World Tour'. He achieved rather negative fame when it was revealed that one of Justin Bieber's music videos, 'Baby', had become the most viewed video on YouTube as well as the most hated.
Bieber made his second foray into acting with a role in 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation' in a 2010 and 2011 episode. 2011 also saw him star in his own biopic movie 'Justin Bieber: Never Say Never' directed by Jon Chu. It topped the box office with a $12.4 million gross on its opening and he subsequently released a remix album entitled 'Never Say Never - The Remixes'. That year he released second studio album 'Under the Mistletoe' which again hit number one in the US and Canada.
He started recording his most highly lauded album yet, 'Believe', at the end of 2011 and in 2012 announced on 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show' that the first single was ' Boyfriend '. It was his first number one hit in Canada and reached number two in the US and UK on its release. 'Believe' itself became a number one in several countries and included collaborations with Darkchild, Hit-Boy, Diplo and Max Martin. He followed it up with his Believe Tour.In 2013, he released an acoustic version of 'Believe' entitled simply ' Believe Acoustic', and later appeared once again on 'Saturday Night Live'. During his Believe Tour, he collapsed with apparent breathing problems at London's O2 Arena when he was backstage and was rushed to hospital. Another issue arose in London when he arrived 2 hours late for a concert, leaving parents angry and fans extremely upset.
2013 also saw him appear in a remixed version of Michael Jackson's unreleased track 'Slave To The Rhythm', as well as collaborating with Lil Twist and Miley Cyrus in Twist's song 'Twerk'. In October, he began his 'Music Mondays' project, releasing a single every week in the run up to his second movie 'Believe 3D'. 'Heartbreaker' was the first track to be released in this series and all ten were announced to feature in a collection called 'Journals'. 
Justin Bieber is a Christian and has previously said that he doesn't believe in abortion and has supported LGBT rights campaigns. 
His mentor Usher suggested Bieber follow a vegan diet after vomiting on stage in 2012 when he drank milk.
In 2013, he was attacked by a man in a Toronto nightclub. Security stepped in by Bieber lost his temper and proceeded to launch an angry attack on the man as he was taken to the ground. This is not the only violent scandal Bieber has been involved with; he was caught on camera shouting and attempting to launch himself at a photographer outside his hotel in London that same year. He had also allegedly spat at one of his neighbours following an argument.
Other controversies include the star getting pulled over in San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles in 2012, after speeding at more than 100 miles an hour in an apparent bid to lose paparazzi tailing him. He has repeatedly caused anger among his neighbours for his reckless driving. In 2013, a paparazzo named Chris Guerra was run over and killed after attempting to snap Bieber in his Ferrari, however it was not Bieber driving it at that time. He also caused some serious annoyance among fans when he was photographed smoking a joint. He later apologised and even made a joke out of it when he hosted 'Saturday Night Live'.
Bieber had a pet capuchin monkey named Mally confiscated at a German airport  when he arrived to play some shows. He caused controversy after apparently abandoning it, leaving it to be re-homed somewhere else. Also in Germany, he visited the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam and caused outrage when he wrote in the guest book, 'Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber.'

hey Justin its me Alicia herring off kik . I cant get on it anymore because I got grounded sorry for that 
Our names are Deniesha, Kennedy, and Carelle. We have a project in vocal class. It is a group project in which the students have to select singers, songwriters or musicians and discuss how their music affected a change in society and in their lives. We then have to contact the singer, songwriter or musician and make a video explaining how their music affected the community, and how it affected them personally. We would love to interview you. We chose you because you are very talented. Please respond by Monday March 24, 2014.
Haha, I found out Justin's number, and I started to call him andit actually rang!! I was too chicken to actually say anything so as soon as I heard it ringing I hung up. It's 1-386-441-9664. Try it!!!
Hey Justin my name is Christina and I am your biggest fan Justin us beliebers love u a lot and were just asking please ignore the trouble forget the social media I know how hard it must be you love your fans and music thats what you do and just concentrate on ur carrier and be that real Justin u r kind forgiving we all love u Justin ♥♥ ~Christina
Justin I'm 61 years old, and I love your music.  Don't let this get you down.  I am appalled at the Americans who signed that petition.  In fact I think they are just envious of you.  They have no right to try to get you out of this country.  How much money did other people make from your singing?  Are they standing by you now?  Well in my opinion you should stay here and you should get a good lawyer to defend yourself.  We have thousands of illegal immigrants in this country and they pick on you?? Hang in there if you read this.  I think you belong here.  If you do read this and want to talk this is my email.  bruja928@msn.com
IMO Justin deep down is a good guy who just got lost in all the fame.  He was taken from childhood and became a big star at such a young age.  I worry about him and hope that he remembers his roots.  Think about how difficult it must have been to be famous, and not really have a chance to grow up, do things that kids get to do, make mistakes that we all made as kids and have those opportunities to learn from them.  Justin had all these outsiders run every minute of his life once he became a star, that can't be easy for any kid.  Now he's making a few mistakes (as we all did) but since he's a big celeb, everyone is watching him and pointing fingers.  I pray for him and really hope that he stays true to himself and gets through this.  Don't be scared to get some help, if you are really suffering from depression, talk about it, we're all human, we understand.  Justin, if you read this, take care of yourself, find your true friends, ditch those who don't care about you and be true to yourself.  Take care and god bless.
