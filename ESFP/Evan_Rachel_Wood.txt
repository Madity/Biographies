Evan Rachel Wood (born September 7, 1987)[2] is an American actress, fashion model and singer. She began acting in the 1990s, appearing in several television series, including American Gothic (1995–1996) and Once and Again (1999–2002). Wood made her début as a leading film actress at the age of nine in Digging to China (1998) and became well known after her transition to a more adult-oriented Golden Globe-nominated role in the teen drama film Thirteen (2003).[3]
Wood continued acting mostly in independent films, including Pretty Persuasion (2005), Down in the Valley (2006), Running with Scissors (2006), and in the big studio production Across the Universe (2007). Since 2008, Wood has appeared in more mainstream films, including The Wrestler (2008), Whatever Works (2009) and The Ides of March (2011). She has also returned to television, playing the supporting role of Queen Sophie-Anne on True Blood from 2009 to 2011 and playing Kate Winslet's daughter in the HBO miniseries Mildred Pierce (2011), a role for which she was nominated for the Golden Globe and Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
Wood has been described by The Guardian as "one of the best actresses of her generation."[4] Her personal life, particularly her relationship with Marilyn Manson, to whom she was previously engaged, has attracted press attention.[5] In 2012, she married English actor Jamie Bell, with whom she has one son. They separated in 2014.
Wood was born in Raleigh, North Carolina. Her father, Ira David Wood III, is a locally prominent actor, singer, theater director, and playwright; he is the Executive Director of a local regional theatre company called Theatre in the Park.[6] Her mother, Sara Lynn Moore (b. March 6, 1958), is an actress, director, and acting coach.[4] Wood's brother, Ira David Wood IV, is also an actor; she has two other brothers, Dana and Thomas, and a sister named Aden. Her paternal aunt, Carol Winstead Wood, was a Hollywood production designer.[7]
Wood and her brothers were actively involved in Theatre in the Park while growing up, including an appearance by her in the 1987 production of her father's internationally renowned musical comedy adaptation of A Christmas Carol when she was just a few months old.[8] Subsequently, she played the Ghost of Christmas Past in several productions at the theater, and she later starred as Helen Keller alongside her mother (who played Anne Sullivan) in a production of The Miracle Worker, under her father's direction.[9][10] Wood briefly attended Cary Elementary, a public school in Cary, North Carolina. She was subsequently home-schooled and received her high school diploma at age 15.[11]
Wood began her career appearing in several made-for-television films from 1994 onward,[12] also playing an occasional role in the television series American Gothic. In 1996, Wood's parents separated and later divorced, and Wood moved with her mother to her mother's native Los Angeles County, California.[4][13] After a one-season role on the television drama Profiler, Wood was cast in the supporting role of Jessie Sammler on the television show Once and Again.
Wood's first major screen role was in the low-budget 1998 film Digging to China, which also starred Kevin Bacon and Mary Stuart Masterson. The film won the Children's Jury Award at the Chicago International Children's Film Festival.[14] Wood remembers the role as initially being hard, but notes that it "eventually led to her decision that acting is something she might never want to stop doing."[4] She also had a role in Practical Magic, a fantasy film directed by Griffin Dunne, starring Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman, that same year.
Wood made her teenage debut as a leading film actress in 2002's Little Secrets, directed by Blair Treu, where she played aspiring 14-year-old concert violinist Emily Lindstrom. For that role, she was nominated for Best Leading Young Actress at the Young Artist Awards.[15] That same year, Wood played a supporting role in the Andrew Niccol-directed science fiction satirical drama film, S1m0ne, which starred Al Pacino. Wood's breakthrough movie role followed with the 2003 film Thirteen. She played the role of Tracy Louise Freeland, one of two young teens who sink into a downward spiral of hard drugs, sex, and petty crime. Her performance was nominated for a Golden Globe Award as Best Actress - Drama and for a Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Award for Best Actress. During the time of Thirteen's release, Vanity Fair named Wood as one of the It Girls of Hollywood, and she appeared, along with the other actresses, on the magazine's July 2003 cover.[16] A supporting role opposite Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones in Ron Howard's The Missing, in which she played the kidnapped daughter, Lilly Gilkeson, followed the same year. Also in 2003 she played the part of Nora Easton in the episode "Got Murder?" of TV series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.
In 2005, Wood appeared in the Mike Binder-directed The Upside of Anger, opposite Kevin Costner and Joan Allen, a well-reviewed film in which Wood played Lavender "Popeye" Wolfmeyer, one of four sisters dealing with their father's absence. Her character also narrated the film.[4] Wood's next two starring roles were in dark independent films. In the 2005 Grand Jury Prize Sundance Film Festival nominee Pretty Persuasion, a black comedy/satirical focusing on themes of sexual harassment and discrimination in schools and attitudes about females in media and society, Wood played Kimberly Joyce, a manipulative, sexually active high-schooler. One critic commented, "Wood does flip cynicism with such precise, easy rhythms and with such obvious pleasure in naughtiness that she's impossible to hate."[17]
In Down in the Valley, which was directed by David Jacobson, Wood's character, Tobe, falls in love with an older man, a cowboy who is at odds with modern society (Edward Norton). Of her performance, it was written that "Wood conveys every bit of the adamant certainty and aching vulnerability inherent in late adolescence."[18] Wood has commented on her choice of sexually themed roles, saying that she is not aiming for the "shock factor" in her film choices.[4] In 2005, Wood starred in the music videos for Bright Eyes' "At the Bottom of Everything" and Green Day's "Wake Me Up When September Ends".
In September 2006, Wood received Premiere magazine's "Spotlight Award for Emerging Talent."[19] Also in 2006, she was described by The Guardian as being "wise beyond her years" and as "one of the best actresses of her generation."[4] Later in 2006, Wood appeared with an all-star ensemble cast as Natalie Finch in the Golden Globe-nominated 2006 comedy-drama film Running with Scissors. Directed by Ryan Murphy and starring Annette Bening, the film was based on the memoir by Augusten Burroughs, which is a semi-autobiographical account of Burroughs' childhood in a dysfunctional family. Wood was awarded the 2007 Cannes Film Festival Chopard Trophy for Female Revelation for her performance.[20]
Wood had roles in two films released in September 2007. King of California, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival,[21] a story of a bipolar jazz musician (Michael Douglas) and his long-suffering teenage daughter, Miranda (Wood), who are reunited after his two-year stay in a mental institution and who embark on a quixotic search for Spanish treasure. One review praised Wood's performance as "excellent".[22]
Across the Universe, a Julie Taymor-directed musical that was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award and was set in Liverpool, New York City, and Vietnam, focused on the tribulations of several characters during the counter-cultural revolution of the 1960s. It was set to the songs of The Beatles. Wood, who has described the music of The Beatles as a major part of her life, played Lucy, who develops a relationship with Jude (Jim Sturgess).[23] The film featured her singing musical numbers and she describes the role as her favorite, calling director Julie Taymor "one of the most amazing directors out there."[24] One critic wrote that "Wood brings much-needed emotional depth."[25] Wood provided the voice of an alien named Mala, a mechanically inclined free-thinker, in Battle for Terra, a 2008 computer-animated science fiction film about a peaceful alien planet that faces destruction from colonization by the displaced remainder of the human race. The film won the 2008 Grand Prize at the Ottawa International Animation Festival. The film showed at the San Francisco International Film Festival, where she received an award at the Midnight Awards along with Elijah Wood.[26]
Wood starred in 2008's Vadim Perelman-directed The Life Before Her Eyes, based on the Laura Kasischke novel of the same name, about the friendship of two teens of opposite character who are involved in a Columbine-like shooting incident at their school and are forced to make an impossible choice. Wood played the younger version of Uma Thurman's character, Diana. One critic cited her performance as "hands-down extraordinary".[27] Wood stated that she intended the film to be the last one in which she played a teenager.[28] In the same year, she also co-starred in director Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler,[29] winner of the Golden Lion Award for Best Film at the Venice Film Festival, about Randy "Ram" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a professional wrestler from the 1980s who is forced to retire after a heart attack threatens to kill him the next time he wrestles. Wood played Stephanie, Randy "Ram" Robinson's estranged daughter. Of her performance, one critic wrote, "Once her character stops stonewalling her father and hears him out, Wood provides a fine foil for Rourke in their turbulent scenes together."[30]
Wood co-starred in Woody Allen's Whatever Works,[31] which premiered at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival, playing the young wife of Larry David's[32] character. In May 2009, she played Juliet in six fundraising performances of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet at the Theater In The Park.[33] The production was directed by her brother, who also starred. Wood had a recurring role in the second and third seasons of the HBO supernatural drama series, True Blood, from 2009 to 2011 as Sophie-Anne Leclerq. She appeared at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010.[34] Wood had a role in the film The Conspirator, which premiered at Ford's Theatre in Washington D. C. in April, 2011, directed by Robert Redford (about the conspiracy surrounding the assassination of Abraham Lincoln). She also had a role in The Ides of March.[35] She portrayed the title character's daughter in the 2011 HBO miniseries Mildred Pierce, for which she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.
Wood began dating British actor Jamie Bell in 2005 after they co-starred in the music video for Green Day's song "Wake Me Up When September Ends."[37] They got matching tattoos of each other's initials; in Wood's case, a "J" on her left ankle.[38] After a year together, the relationship ended in 2006.[37] Wood later commented that, "We had matching tattoos because we knew our love would last forever. Trouble is, it didn't, things happened, we split. But I don't regret the tattoo. It reminds me of a great, great period in my life."[39]
In January 2007, Wood's relationship with Marilyn Manson became public.[40] The two met at a party at the Chateau Marmont Hotel; Wood has stated that she was attracted to Manson's frequent use of black eye liner and once described their relationship as "healthy and loving."[41] Two portraits of Wood, painted by Manson, have been exhibited at the Celebritarian Corporation Gallery of Fine Art.[42] Wood is also the inspiration behind Manson's song "Heart-Shaped Glasses", and she appeared with Manson in the song's music video. Manson has said that Wood's appearance was the highest-paid music video role ever.[28] The couple split in November 2008; according to Wood, they "both decided to take some time apart so [they] could concentrate on work."[43] They later re-united and it was reported in early January 2010 that the couple was engaged to be married.[44] Wood and Manson ended their engagement in August 2010.[45]
In the summer of 2011, Wood was reported to have rekindled her relationship with Jamie Bell, five years after they first broke up.[39] The couple married in a small ceremony on October 30, 2012.[46] They have one son, born in July 2013.[47] Wood had a natural home birth with her son, and publicly thanked Ricki Lake, creator of the documentary The Business of Being Born, for inspiring her decision.[48] In May 2014, Wood and Bell announced that they had separated after 19 months of marriage.[49]
In August 2012, Wood identified herself as bisexual on Twitter.[50][51] Wood's mother is a convert to Judaism and Wood's father is Christian.[52][53] In 2003, Wood described herself as Jewish.[54] In 2012, she stated, "I believe in God but I am not religious. I am spiritual. My definition of God isn't in any religion. It's very personal".[55]

      Met her husband Jamie Bell at Sundance Film Festival. While dating, they went on to shoot Green Day's music video for "Wake Me Up When September Ends", where they play a couple.
      Wood says that her character in Across the Universe (2007), whom she describes as an "old soul, street smart and ahead of her time", is close to her real-life personality. Wood also describes herself as being "laid back" and "not a party girl", citing her choice to stay away from what is considered a typical Hollywood lifestyle.

      Returned to work 6 months after giving birth to her son to begin filming 10 Things I Hate About Life (2014).
      I look back on some of the stuff I wore and I'm so embarrassed. I definitely blame it on this clique of girls I was friends with back then. I've been talked into wearing stuff that I didn't want to wear. Now, I like very simple, elegant things, by 'Oscar de la Renta' or Armani.
      What's nice about acting is that you're not just left with yourself all the time, but you get to see the world through so many different people's eyes.
      Growing up on screen is painful. I have had to go through puberty with millions watching.... I hope to have a career like Jodie Foster, going from child to adult actress.
      If the world were to end tomorrow, I really believe I could say I have lived a full life already - and that I have been extremely lucky.
      Once you commit, you commit. You can't hold back. We all knew that the only way we would pull this [movie] off was for everyone to give everything they had. I could not hold back. On playing "Tracy" in the movie Thirteen (2003).
      Whenever something bad happens, I just always have to tell myself that this is happening for a reason, and I have to be learning something from this and taking something away from this. And you just have to think about the big picture, and you have to remember just how small you are in the grand scheme of things, and that in the long run, you're probably going to be okay. So that's all I kept thinking about...just trying to make the best out of .
      Oh God, I worry about everything, such as I'm gonna say something stupid. I'm not good at communicating what's going on in my head.
      I just hate all that (showbusiness mingling). I just have to come back to reality for a little bit, have a real life. I'm pretty laid-back. I hang out with my friends, read, go to concerts and try and travel as much as I can. I'm not a party girl, I don't eat at the Ivy and I'm not shopping on Rodeo Drive. It's pretty easy to stay out of that if you want to. There are other places. I really like being able to go out anywhere and nobody really cares.
      It is a little weird, and I do feel a little bit disoriented sometimes. I'm usually pretty shy around people and pretty private. So yeah, it is a little weird all of a sudden to see yourself everywhere with your tongue hanging out! And a pierced tongue! - on her fame.
      I used to not even be able to order pizza on the phone because I was just so shy. I think that's why so much comes out on-screen, because that's my time to let go in a safe place. When you're doing that, it's all written down on paper and it's total fiction.
      I'm such a crazy perfectionist, I probably stood in Linens 'n Things looking at the square plates or the round plates for, like, 10 minutes, going, "God, this is a big decision. These are my first plates! What am I going to get? What do I do?! - on being independent, and getting her own home.
      And crazy, by the way, is the highest compliment I pay. Manson is definitely crazy. Hopefully I am, too.
      [on dating Marilyn Manson] Everyone is so worried that I'm losing myself, but really I'm finding myself. I've never been more comfortable in my own skin.
      You get a script that's not very good, and they're offering you millions of dollars, but you think: Okay, this script is so bad, I won't even do it for a million dollars... And then it gets to No. 1 at the box office, and people ask, "Don't you regret not doing that?" Not really.
      [on translating scripts onto the screen]: A script can just be a blueprint, and you've got to go in and build it and color it in and paint it.
      I won't just take my clothes off for anybody. It has to be the right circumstances. I couldn't have thought of a better way to do it because it wasn't a sex scene. It's a sleeping woman and somebody is singing something, which is one of the most beautiful songs written about a woman, period. And he's singing about you. (on doing her first nude scene in Across the Universe (2007))
      If I go to see a Beatles film, I want it to be weird and artistic and interesting and experimental and psychedelic and dark at times and also beautiful -- and that's what this is. (on Across the Universe (2007))
      I like to do movies that I don't expect everyone to like. If someone comes up to me and says, 'I hated that movie you did,' I think, at least you felt passionate about it. It stuck with you and you had some feeling about it.
      I'd love to [make an album], but I've just never met people who didn't want to turn me into some pop diva.
      He's the best guy friend I have. I've always hung out with guys, but it's hard to find really good guy relationships that don't get weird. And it never has with us, once. (on Across the Universe (2007) co-star Jim Sturgess)
      We never have to explain anything. He can say something, or I can say something, and we automatically get it. And that's really nice when you can find somebody who needs no explanation. (on boyfriend Marilyn Manson)
      Falling in love is one of the scariest and hardest things that someone can do, but it's also the most amazing thing that can happen to you.
      I've always had a real fascination with Alice in Wonderland and really related to it in some way. And since I was little, people always nicknamed me Alice, even total strangers. I do know I'm always in Wonderland. And I'm definitely just as curious. I don't mind being amongst the mad people, I enjoy it.

=======================================================
late 1980sWelcome, EvanWood's father David (a theater director) and mother Sara (an actress) put their baby daughter in his productions. "Once I was old enough to walk and talk, I was pushed out on stage, and I just kind of did it ever since," she tells the Los Angeles Times in 2005. "It wasn't until I was about 9 or some thing that I realized that this was a really special thing I was getting to do and I wanted to keep doing it." In 1995, she appears in the supernatural series, American Gothic.1997Once and AgainAfter her parents' divorce, Wood moves to L.A. with her mother, where she is cast as Billy Campbell's daughter (right) on the ABC drama, Once and Again. As Jessie, Wood tackles an eating disorder and an attraction to a female classmate. "I remember the first episode I directed after the pilot," the show's producer Marshall Herskovitz tells Newsweek. "There was a scene where she had to break down and cry. I'm sitting there watching her in the monitor, and I started to cry. That was the first time in 25 years of directing that I cried on the set." After three seasons, the critically acclaimed series is cancelled due to low ratings.1998September 11Feature DebutWood, 11, makes her feature debut as a girl who befriends a mentally handicapped Kevin Bacon in Digging to China (left). In the coming years, she appears with Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman in Practical Magic and Cate Blanchett in Ron Howard's The Missing. "I think she is scarily good," Andrew Niccol, who directed her in S1m0ne, tells the Los Angeles Times. "The great thing about Evan is that there is an intelligence behind her eyes. There is something going on. The thing about her is, I don't know where she gets it from. She has amazing maturity." 2003January 17Thirteen"I put it down. I was afraid of it for a while because of the subject matter. It was so intense," Wood tells the Los Angeles Times of reading the screenplay for Thirteen, in which she plays a teen who changes overnight from polite girl-next-door to having sex, shoplifting and doing drugs. "I had never really done anything like that. I phoned my agent and, right then, I said, 'I have to do this movie.'" The film, which also stars Holly Hunter and Nikki Reed (right), introduces Wood to a larger audience of critics and indie film directors.2005April 01Switching GearsWood plays Joan Allen's youngest daughter in The Upside of Anger with Keri Russell and Erika Christensen (right). "It was nice to play a sane girl for a change, nice to have this sweet film to balance everything out, because everybody thinks I just go for extreme roles," Wood tells L.A.'s Daily News.AugustRinging BellWood appears in Green Day's "Wake Me Up When September Ends" music video alongside Billy Elliott star Jamie Bell (left). They begin dating, and step out together as a couple at the premiere of 2005's King Kong. "I think Jamie is awesome. And it's even better when you know him because he's just a completely different person on screen," Wood says. 2006June 23The Real Mean GirlIn Pretty Persuasion, Wood plays a 15-year-old mischievous vixen who frames a teacher for sexual harassment. L.A.'s Daily News says the film makes Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams' Mean Girls "look like a Girl Scout Jamboree," while the New York Times says Wood "is a screen monster worthy to stand beside Suzanne Stone, Nicole Kidman's fame-obsessed television weather reporter in To Die For."August 27Running with ScissorsAlongside Annette Bening and Gwyneth Paltrow, Wood plays the bold daughter of an eccentric psychotherapist in the film adaptation of Augusten Burroughs' bestselling memoir Running with Scissors. Of playing another dark teen, she tells Newsweek, "There are plenty of movies about teens and proms. That's what I want to shy away from, to show there's many more levels."2007JanuaryDating Marilyn MansonWeeks after Marilyn Manson, 38, files for divorce from Dita Von Teese, 34, Wood, 19, is linked to the rocker. Sources tell PEOPLE that their relationship was a factor in Manson's divorce. "I've found my double, my twin," Manson tells France's Le Parisien newspaper. "She's l9 and certainly that's very young, but that's not a problem for me." Wood, who appears in Manson's "Heart-Shaped Glasses" music video (inset), tells the British edition of Elle that he is "lovely, really human and just amazing. It may surprise you just how healthy and loving our relationship is." September 12Belting Beatles TunesWood sings Beatles hits in the musical drama set during the Vietnam War protests in Across the Universe with Jim Sturgess (right). "The hardest part is singing live and acting at the same time," Wood, who sings "If I Fell" in the film, tells USA Today. "You have to show emotion and sing the song well. These are the most well-loved songs, so you don't want to disappoint." Director Julie Taymor adds: "She's the best young actress out there...she has been doing this since she was a child. She's like an old-time movie star."

Her relationship with Marilyn Manson has received considerable news coverage.[1] In August 2010, after being engaged for eight months the couple decided to separate. 
Wood was born in Raleigh, North Carolina to Ira David Wood III, an award-winning actor, singer, theatre director and playwright, and Sara Lynn Moore, an actress. Her brother, Ira David Wood IV, is also an actor. She also has a half brother, Dana, from her mother's first marriage. Her aunt, Carol Winstead Wood, is a Hollywood production designer. Wood is Jewish according to Jewish Law as her mother is a convert.
Wood and her brother were actively involved in their father's theatre, Theatre In The Park, while growing up; she appeared in a production of A Christmas Carol at the theatre when she was a few months old, and later starred as Helen Keller in a production of The Miracle Worker, under her father's direction.
She appeared in several made-for-television films from 1994 and onwards, also playing an occasional role in the television series American Gothic. In early 1997, Wood's parents separated and later divorced, and Wood moved with her mother to her mother's native Los Angeles, where Wood was cast in the supporting role of Jessie Sammler on the television show Once and Again. Wood's first major screen role was in the low-budget 1998 film, Digging to China, which also starred Kevin Bacon and Mary Stuart Masterson. Wood remembers the role as initially being "hard", but notes that it eventually led to her decision that acting is something she "might never want to stop doing."
Wood left regular school at the age of eleven, and was home schooled, because of bullying and difficulty with teachers, who Wood says treated her like she was "spoiled" because she was an actress. She later drew upon her experiences with bullying to portray a malicious high school student in Pretty Persuasion. Wood subsequently appeared in a number of films catering to a teenage audience, including Little Secrets. She was set to have the leading role in the films Raise Your Voice and Mean Girls, but was unable to because of production scheduling changes. Wood's breakthrough movie role followed, with the controversial 2003 independent film Thirteen, for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award as Best Actress - Drama. During the time of Thirteen's release, Vanity Fair named Wood as one of the It Girls of Hollywood, and she appeared, along with the other actresses, on the magazine's July 2003 cover.
Her next two starring roles were in the dark independent films, Pretty Persuasion, in which she played a villainous, sexually active high-schooler, and Down in the Valley, in which her character engages in a sexual relationship with an older man posing as a cowboy. Wood has commented on her choice of sexually themed roles, saying that she is not aiming for the "shock factor" in her film choices, and adding that she hopes her roles "spread awareness" about the consequences of deviant behavior among teenagers, citing that she has known people who behave similarly to her film characters.
In 2005, Wood starred in the music videos for Bright Eyes' "At the Bottom of Everything" and Green Day's "Wake Me Up When September Ends". In September of 2006, she received Premiere magazine's "Spotlight Award for Emerging Talent".
Wood has roles in several as-yet unreleased films, including King of California, and Across the Universe, a musical directed by Julie Taymor and set in the United Kingdom, United States and Vietnam; she will perform musical numbers in the film. During August and September 2006, Wood filmed In Bloom, in which she plays a younger version of a character played by Uma Thurman.
In the summer of 2009 she will be playing the role of an over 500 year old French vampire in the second season of HBO's "True Blood".
Wood was homeschooled due to bullying, and received her high school diploma at age fifteen. She has a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and enjoys singing, having recorded the songs "Christmas Isn't Christmas Without You" and "Silver and Gold" for the School's out Christmas Album, which featured various artists. Wood is now considering taking part-time college courses, but is not yet pursuing a full-time college education.
Wood has said that her character in Across the Universe, whom she describes as an "old soul, street smart and ahead of her time", is close to her real-life personality. Wood also describes herself as being "laid back" and "not a party girl", citing her choice to stay away from what is considered a typical Hollywood lifestyle.
In 2006, Wood, who was described by The Guardian as an "Anglophile", dated her "Wake Me Up When September Ends" music video co-star, English actor Jamie Bell. She is also a friend of actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
In January 2007, reports emerged romantically linking Wood to shock rock star Marilyn Manson before he made public his estrangement from his wife, Dita Von Teese. Wood was allegedly a factor in the demise of their relationship according to Von Teese, who stated she was not supportive of Manson's lifestyle whereas Wood was. Two portraits of Wood, painted by Manson, were part of the inagural exhibition at The Celebritarian Corporation Gallery of Fine Art. Manson subsequently confirmed that the two were together in a BBC Radio 1 interview with presenter Zane Lowe. Wood inspired much of Manson's Eat Me, Drink Me album including the lead single "Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)". Later in 2007 Wood appeared with Manson in the music video, "Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)", having simulated sex with him in the video. Manson dedicated the album to Wood.
On November 5, 2008, it was reported that Manson and Wood had separated as of late October. According to the Bio Channel's authorised documentary on Manson, the course of the separation was Wood's refusal of Manson's engagement proposal. The two were separated through much of the recording but reunited after Manson's seventh album The High End of Low was finished. Before Manson set out to promote the album, they separated once more with Manson dating the pornographic actress Stoya.
In November 2009 Manson confirmed he had once more reunited with Wood and the two announced their engagement in January 2010. Seven months later, during the recording of Born Villain, it emerged that Manson and Wood had called off their engagement.
Wood has several tattoos, a number of which are related to Manson. On Feburary 14, 2007 she had a black heart with a lightning bolt at the centre inked on her thigh. This was at the same session that Manson had his spiral heart tattoo. Her second Manson-related tattoo, dating from around January 2009, is of a 15 behind her right ear matching Manson's. After the two became engaged, Evan had another tattoo related to Manson, of a heart intertwined with an infinity symbol. Her other tattoos are a 'j' on her left ankle for former (and current) boyfriend Jamie Bell; the Edgar Allan Poe quote, "All that we see or seem, is but a dream within a dream" across her upper back; a candle based on a design by Shel Silverstein, also on on her back; the word "unless" underneath her right breast; and another on the inside of her lower lip, of a word she has yet to disclose. She formerly had a Beatles themed tattoo of a strawberry on her right ankle, which she first covered up with a black diamond in reference to both Pink Floyd and her own nickname of "Crazy Diamond", before having the tattoo removed. 
 Evan is currently pregnant with British actor Jamie Bell's child, whom she has also been married to since October 2012.
 Evan was often referred to as "Snowflake" during The High End of Low tour, as she would frequently hold on to the band's supply of cocaine.

AMC is banking big on Turn, its new spy series set during the Revolutionary War. With Breaking Bad over and Mad Men entering its final season, not to mention last year's non-starter Low Winter Sun, the network is in desperate need of a drama besides The Walking Dead on which to hang its storytelling hat.

The film's director Gil Junger will write and direct a spin-off film, entitled 10 Things I Hate About Life, Vulture reports. Evan Rachel Wood and Suburgatory's Thomas McDonell will star as two people who meet-cute right when they are about to commit suicide.
