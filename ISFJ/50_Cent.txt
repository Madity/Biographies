Curtis James Jackson III (born July 6, 1975), better known by his stage name 50 Cent, is an American rapper, entrepreneur, investor, and actor from New York City, New York. He rose to fame with the release of his albums Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2003) and The Massacre (2005). His major-label debut Get Rich or Die Tryin', has been certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[1] 50 Cent also gained prominence with East Coast hip hop group G-Unit, of which he is the de facto leader.
Born in the South Jamaica neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens, Jackson began drug dealing at the age of twelve during the 1980s crack epidemic.[2] After leaving drug dealing to pursue a rap career, he was shot at and struck by nine bullets during an incident in 2000. After releasing his album Guess Who's Back? in 2002, Jackson was discovered by rapper Eminem and signed to Interscope Records, Shady Records and Aftermath Entertainment. With the help of Eminem and Dr. Dre, who produced his first major commercial successes, Jackson became one of the world's highest selling rappers. In 2003, he founded the record label G-Unit Records, which signed several successful rappers such as Young Buck, Lloyd Banks, and Tony Yayo.
Throughout his music career, Jackson has sold over 30 million albums worldwide and won several awards, including a Grammy Award, 13 Billboard Music Awards, six World Music Awards, three American Music Awards and four BET Awards.[3] He has also pursued an acting career, appearing in the semi-autobiographical film Get Rich or Die Tryin' in 2005, the Iraq War film Home of the Brave in 2006, and Righteous Kill in 2008. 50 Cent was ranked as the sixth-best artist of the 2000s by Billboard magazine. The magazine also ranked him as the fourth top male artist and as the third top rapper behind Eminem and Nelly.[4] Billboard magazine also ranked him as the sixth best and most successful Hot 100 Artist of the 2000s[5] and as the number one rap artist of the 2000s.[6] Billboard ranked his album Get Rich or Die Tryin' as the twelfth best album of the 2000s[7] and his album The Massacre as the 37th best album of the 2000s.[8] 50 Cent released his fifth studio album, Animal Ambition on June 3, 2014, and is also reported to be working on his seventh studio album, Street King Immortal, which is set to be released shortly after Animal Ambition.
Curtis Jackson III was born and raised in South Jamaica, a poverty-stricken urban neighborhood in Queens, New York City. He was raised solely by his mother, Sabrina, who gave birth to him at the age of fifteen. 50 Cent stated that his mother worked as a cocaine dealer and was a lesbian.[9] The line "Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl" from "Hate It or Love It" featuring The Game also refers to his mother's sexuality.[10] In 1983, she became unconscious after having consumed a drugged drink and eventually died as a result of the gas in her apartment turned on amidst closed windows.[11][12] Following her death, Jackson moved into his grandparents' house with his eight aunts and uncles.[13][14][15] He recalls, "My grandmother told me, 'Your mother's not coming home. She's not gonna come back to pick you up. You're gonna stay with us now.' That's when I started adjusting to the streets a little bit".[16]
At age eleven, Jackson started boxing. The following year, Jackson started working with narcotics but informed his grandparents he attended school programs.[17] During this time, he began bringing guns and drug money to school. When Jackson was fourteen years old, a neighbor opened a boxing gym for local youth. He recalled: "When I wasn't killing time in school, I was sparring in the gym or selling crack on the strip."[18] In the mid-1980s, Jackson competed in the Junior Olympics as an amateur boxer. He later stated: "I was competitive in the ring and hip-hop is competitive too... I think rappers condition themselves like boxers, so they all kind of feel like they're the champ".[19] At the age of sixteen, he was caught by metal detectors at Andrew Jackson High School. He later explained that he was embarrassed by his subsequent arrest and confessed to his grandmother that he was selling drugs.[16]
Afterwards, Jackson was sent to correctional boot camp. Following his release, he adopted the nickname "50 Cent" as a metaphor for "change".[20] The name was derived from Kelvin Martin, a Brooklyn robber known as "50 Cent". Jackson chose the name "because it says everything I want it to say. I'm the same kind of person 50 Cent was. I provide for myself by any means".[21]
In 1996, when he was 21 years old, Jackson started rapping in a friend's basement. He used turntables to record over instrumentals.[22] Another friend introduced him to Jam Master Jay of Run–D.M.C. who was organizing his label Jam Master Jay Records. Jay taught Jackson how to count bars, write choruses, structure songs, and create a record.[23][24] Jackson's first official appearance was on a song titled "React" with the group Onyx on their 1998 album Shut 'Em Down. He credited Jam Master Jay as an influence who helped him improve his ability to write hooks.[19] Jay produced Jackson's first album. The album was shelved and never released.[11]
In 1999, after leaving Jam Master Jay, the platinum-selling producers Trackmasters took notice of Jackson and signed him to Columbia Records. They sent him to a studio in Upstate New York where he produced thirty-six songs in two weeks.[12] Eighteen were included on his unofficially released album, Power of the Dollar in 2000.[25] He also started the now-defunct Hollow Point Entertainment with former G-Unit affiliate Bang 'Em Smurf.[26][27]
Jackson's popularity increased after the controversial underground single, "How to Rob", which he wrote in thirty minutes while in a car on the way to his studio.[20][28] The track comically explains how he would rob famous artists. He explained the reasoning behind song's content as, "There's a hundred artists on that label, you gotta separate yourself from that group and make yourself relevant".[20] Rappers Jay-Z, Kurupt, Sticky Fingaz, Big Pun, DMX, Wyclef Jean and the Wu-Tang Clan replied to the song[28] and Nas, who received the track positively, invited Jackson to travel on a promotional tour for his Nastradamus album.[15] The song was intended to be released with "Thug Love" featuring Destiny's Child, but two days before he was scheduled to film the "Thug Love" music video, Jackson was shot and confined to a hospital due to his injuries.[29]
On May 24, 2000, Jackson was attacked by a gunman, alleged to be Darryl "Hommo" Baum, outside his grandmother's former home in South Jamaica, Queens. He went into a friend's car, but was asked to return to the house to get jewelry.
His son was in the house, while his grandmother was in the front yard.[12] Upon returning to the back seat of the car and already seated, another car pulled up nearby. An assailant then walked up to Jackson's left side with a 9mm handgun and fired nine shots at close range. He was shot nine times: in the hand (a round hit his right thumb, to where the bullet passed through and out his little finger), arm, hip, both legs, chest, and his face (his left cheek).[11][16][30] The face wound resulted in a swollen tongue, the loss of a wisdom tooth, and a small slur in his voice.[15][16][31] (He maintains a bullet fragment in his tongue because it was thought that taking it out would further damage his nerves and taste buds.[32]) His friend also sustained a gunshot wound to the hand. They were driven to the hospital where Jackson spent thirteen days.
Baum, the alleged shooter, was killed three weeks later.[33] He was also Mike Tyson's close friend and bodyguard.[34]
Jackson recalled the incident saying, "It happens so fast that you don't even get a chance to shoot back.... I was scared the whole time.... I was looking in the rear-view mirror like, 'Oh shit, somebody shot me in the face! It burns, burns, burns.'"[16] In his autobiography, From Pieces to Weight: Once upon a Time in Southside Queens, he wrote, "After I got shot nine times at close range and didn't die, I started to think that I must have a purpose in life... How much more damage could that shell have done? Give me an inch in this direction or that one, and I'm gone".[13] He used a walker for the first six weeks and fully recovered after five months. When he left the hospital, he stayed in the Poconos with his then-girlfriend and son. His workout regimen helped him attain his muscular physique.[11][16][35] While in the hospital, Jackson signed a publishing deal with Columbia Records. However, he was dropped from the label and "blacklisted" in the recording industry because of his song "Ghetto Qu'ran".[36]
Unable to find a studio to work within the U.S, he traveled to Canada.[37][38] Along with his business partner Sha Money XL, he recorded over thirty songs for mixtapes, with the purpose of building a reputation.
According to Shady Records A&R Marc Labelle in an interview with HitQuarters, Jackson shrewdly used the mixtape circuit to his own advantage saying, "He took all the hottest beats from every artist and flipped them with better hooks. They then got into all the markets on the mixtapes and all the mixtape DJs were messing with them."[39] Jackson's popularity rose and in 2002, he released material independently on the mixtape, Guess Who's Back?. Beginning to attract interest, and now backed by G-Unit, Jackson continued to release music including 50 Cent Is the Future. The mixtape revisited material by Jay-Z and Raphael Saadiq.[25]
In 2002, Eminem listened to a copy of Jackson's Guess Who's Back? CD. He received the CD through Jackson's attorney, who was working with Eminem's manager Paul Rosenberg.[29] Impressed with the album, Eminem invited Jackson to fly to Los Angeles, where he was introduced to Dr. Dre.[11][23][29] After signing a $1 million record deal,[23] Jackson released the mixtape, No Mercy, No Fear. It featured one new track, "Wanksta", which was put on Eminem's 8 Mile soundtrack.[25] He was also signed to Chris Lighty's Violator Management and Sha Money XL's Money Management Group.
In February 2003, Jackson released his commercial debut album, Get Rich or Die Tryin'. AllMusic described it as "probably the most hyped debut album by a rap artist in about a decade".[40] Rolling Stone noted the album for its "dark synth grooves, buzzy keyboards and a persistently funky bounce" with Jackson complementing the production in "an unflappable, laid-back flow".[41] Get Rich or Die Tryin' debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 872,000 copies in the first four days.[42] The lead single, "In da Club", which The Source noted for its "blaring horns, funky organs, guitar riffs and sparse hand claps",[43] broke a Billboard record as the most listened-to song in radio history within a week.[44]
Interscope Records granted Jackson his own label, G-Unit Records, in 2003.[45] He signed Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, and Young Buck as the established members of G-Unit. Banks, Yayo and 50 Cent, or G-Unit as they are collectively known, released their debut album Beg for Mercy, on November 13, 2003, under the newly founded label. West Coast rapper The Game, was later signed under a joint venture with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment.
In March 2005, Jackson's second commercial album, The Massacre, sold 1.14 million copies in the first four days-the highest in an abbreviated sales cycle[42]- and peaked at number one on the Billboard 200 for six weeks.[46]
He became the first solo artist to have three singles on the Billboard top five in the same week with "Candy Shop", "Disco Inferno", and "How We Do".[47] Rolling Stone noted that "50's secret weapon is his singing voice - the deceptively amateur-sounding tenor croon that he deploys on almost every chorus".[48]
After The Game's departure, Jackson signed singer Olivia and rap veterans Mobb Deep to G-Unit Records. Spider Loc, M.O.P., 40 Glocc and Young Hot Rod later joined the label.[49][50] Jackson expressed interest in working with rappers outside of G-Unit, such as Lil' Scrappy of BME, LL Cool J from Def Jam, Mase from Bad Boy, and Freeway of Roc-A-Fella, some of whom he recorded with.[51]
In September 2007, he released his third album Curtis, which was inspired by his life before Get Rich or Die Tryin'.[52] It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 691,000 units in the first week,[53] behind Kanye West's Graduation, whom he had a sales competition with, as both albums were released on the same day.
He confirmed on TRL on September 10, 2008 that his fourth studio album, Before I Self Destruct, will be "done and released in November". On May 18, 2009, Jackson released a song entitled "Ok, You're Right". The song was produced by Dr. Dre and was included in Before I Self Destruct. In fall 2009, 50 Cent appeared in the new season of VH1's Behind the Music. On September 3, 2009, months upon the release of Before I Self Destruct, Jackson posted a video[54] for the Soundkillers' Phoenix[55] produced track "Flight 187" which introduced his mixtape, the 50th LAW, and was also featured as a bonus track on his iTunes release of Before I Self Destruct. The song ignited speculation that there was tension between rapper 50 Cent and Jay Z for Jackson's comments in the song.[56]
In an interview with the British entertainment website ContactMusic, 50 Cent announced that he was working on a dance album named Black Magic. 50 Cent said he was inspired by the European nightclubs. "First they played hip-hop which suddenly changed to uptempo songs, known as Eurodance".[57] He went on The Invitation Tour in the summer of 2010, in support of Before I Self Destruct album, and the then shelved Black Magic album. He "recorded 20 songs to a whole different album concept" before he put those to the side and did something different.[58]
50 Cent revealed that he wanted his new album to have the same "aggression" as his debut record, Get Rich or Die Tryin'.[59][60]
He later tweeted that the album was "80 percent done", and stated that fans can expect the album in the summer of 2011; however, the album was delayed to 2012, due to tensions and disagreements at Interscope Records, Later 50 Cent said that he will release his album in November 2011[61] and it has also been confirmed that "Black Magic" was no longer the album's title.[61] 50 Cent has already confirmed that Eminem will appear on the album, but he also confirmed that he has been working with new producers such as Boi-1da and Alex da Kid.[62] Cardiak, who produced Lloyd Banks' “Start It Up”, also confirmed that he had produced a song for the upcoming album.[63]
DJ Whoo Kid confirmed in an interview that 50 Cent was filming a new movie with Robert De Niro in New Orleans.[64]
50 Cent released the first song from his fifth studio album, titled "Outlaw", to the Internet on June 16, 2011.[65] The single was produced by Cardiak. It was released to iTunes on July 19, 2011,[66] although 50 Cent confirmed through his Twitter account that the song was not the album's first single.[67]
Unlike his previous literary efforts — which focus on his life story and the rules of power — this time he's aiming at a teen audience with a semi-autobiographical novel about bullying. According to a statement from the book's publisher, the first-person novel is slated for release in January 2012 and will tell the story of a 13-year-old schoolyard bully "who finds redemption as he faces what he's done."[68]
50 Cent has promised to deliver his fifth studio album album over the past few years, but the LP may be delayed until 2012. In a series of tweets, 50 Cent explained that him and his label Interscope Records aren’t on the same page on how to roll out the album and that he’s delaying its release until they see eye to eye.[61]
50 Cent later suggested that his album will be releasing in November 2011, along with his headphone line SMS by 50.[61]
50 Cent spoke to MTV in relation to the possibility of leaving Interscope Records. "I don't know," 50 told MTV News when asked if he would ink back with Interscope once his five-album deal was fulfilled. "It will all be clear in the negotiations following me turning this actual album in. And, of course, the performance and how they actually treat the work will determine whether you still want to stay in that position or not."[69]
On June 20, 2011, 50 Cent announced that he will release an LP titled Before I Self Destruct II. The announced sequel to his 2009 LP is suggested to be released after his fifth studio album.[70]
On June 26, 2011, 50 Cent planned to shoot a music video for the lead single from his fifth studio album titled "I'm On It".[71] However, the music video never surfaced.[72]
50 Cent spoke to Shade45 in relation guest appearances for his fifth studio album. "I did four songs in Detroit with Eminem. I did two with Just Blaze, a Boi-1da joint, and I did something with Alex da Kid. We made two that are definite singles and the other two are the kinds of records that we been making, more aimed at my core audience, more aggressive, more of a different kind of energy to it."[73]
In September 2011, 50 Cent released a song titled "Street King Energy Track #7" in attempt to promote his charitable energy drink Street King.[74] On September 28, 2011, it was confirmed that 50 Cent is shooting a music video for his lead single from his fifth studio album titled "Girls Go Wild", which features Jeremih.[75][76]
50 Cent's fifth studio album, Street King Immortal, was due to be released on November 13, 2012.[77] Initially reported to be released during the summer of 2012,[78] the release date of Street King Immortal has since been revised on several occasions, largely due to disagreements between 50 Cent and Interscope over the release and promotion of the album, which led to the album's brief cancellation. The first single, "New Day", was released on July 27, 2012, featuring Dr. Dre and Alicia Keys. The song was produced by Dr. Dre, mixed by Eminem, and written by 50 Cent, Alicia Keys, Royce da 5'9", and Dr. Dre. A solo version by Alicia Keys was leaked by her husband, Swizz Beatz. "My Life" was the album's second single, featuring fellow rapper Eminem and Maroon 5's lead singer Adam Levine, released on November 26, 2012. 50 Cent confirmed the album's release date to February 26, 2013, in commemoration of 10 years anniversary of his debut album Get Rich or Die Tryin'.[79] However, the album is still yet to be released and currently has no set release date.[80]
In January 2014, 50 Cent said he plans on releasing a project called Animal Ambition in the first quarter of 2014 and that Street King Immortal will come out after.[81][82] On February 20, 2014, 50 Cent left Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope, after a 12-year union and subsequently signed himself and his G-Unit imprint to Caroline Records and Capitol Records[83] 50 Cent owed Interscope one more album due to the deal he initially signed but was let out of the deal anyway due to his friendship with Eminem and Dr. Dre. Speaking on the matter 50 Cent said, "I’m a special case and situation. It’s also because of the leverage of having the strong relationships with Eminem and Dr. Dre. They don’t want me to be uncomfortable. They value our friendship to the point that they would never want [to jeopardize] it over that little bit of money."[84] On the same day he announced that his fifth studio album Animal Ambition, would be released on June 3, 2014.[85] On February 21 along with the news of his leaving Interscope Records, 50 Cent also released the first track off of his Animal Ambition. The track, entitled "Funeral", was released with an accompanying video via Forbes.com. The track was produced by Jake One and is a continuation of his song 50 Bars, from a previous album. It was also announced that 2 more tracks from Animal Ambition would be released on March 18.[86] While performing at SXSW in Austin, Texas 50 Cent performed a new song from his forthcoming Animal Ambition Lp entitled "Hold On."[87] That song as well as another track entitled "Don't Worry 'Bout It" were released with accompanying videos for each on March 18.[88] 50 Cent has stated that prosperity will be a theme of the album stating, "This project, I had to search for a concept, a really good concept, in my perspective, and that was prosperity. I outlined all the things that would be a part of prosperity, positive and negative [for Animal Ambition]." [89]
In 2005, Jackson made a cameo appearance on The Simpsons episode "Pranksta Rap", in which he makes light of his legal troubles. The same year, he starred alongside Terrence Howard in the semi-autobiographical film Get Rich or Die Tryin'. He starred in the 2006 film Home of the Brave, as a soldier returning home from the Iraq War, traumatized after killing an Iraqi woman.[90] Jackson is working[when?] on a role as a fighter in an Angola State Prison in Spectacular Regret alongside Nicolas Cage, and starred opposite Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in 2008's Righteous Kill, a movie regarding a police death.[91]
In 2008, Jackson started a reality television show on MTV titled 50 Cent: The Money and the Power; the winning contestant, Ryan Mayberry, won a $100,000 investment from Jackson.[92]
Jackson provided the voice-over as the protagonist in the video game 50 Cent: Bulletproof, which was released for PlayStation 2, Xbox, and the PlayStation Portable. Its sequel, 50 Cent: Blood on the Sand, was released in early 2009.[93][94]
In the business world, Jackson has established himself in a variety of industries. Most notably, he started his own record label G Unit Records after gaining national success in 2003.[45] In November 2003, he signed a five-year deal with Reebok to distribute a "G-Unit Sneakers" line as part of his G-Unit Clothing Company.[95][96]
He worked with Glacéau to create a vitamin water drink called Formula 50. In 2007, Coca-Cola purchased Glacéau for US$4.1 billion. Forbes estimated Jackson, who owns a stake in the company, earned $100 million from the deal after taxes.[97] He has teamed up with Right Guard to launch a body spray called Pure 50 RGX Body Spray and a condom line called Magic Stick Condoms,[98] in which he planned to donate part of the proceeds to HIV awareness.[99] Jackson has signed a multi-year deal with Steiner Sports to sell his memorabilia.[100]
In August 2007, Jackson announced plans to launch a dietary supplement company in conjunction with his movie Spectacular Regret.[101]
Jackson has also started two film production companies, one called G-Unit Films in 2003 and another called Cheetah Vision in 2008.[102][103] G-Unit Films later folded and Jackson began to focus his efforts on his second film company.[104] In 2010, Jackson's second film production company Cheetah Vision landed $200 million in funding.[105]
In July 2011, Jackson shifted his entrepreneurial ambitions towards philanthropy. He revealed his initiative to provide food for one billion starving people in Africa by 2016. 50 Cent teamed up with Pure Growth Partners to launch a charitable energy drink called Street King that will help aid in combating world hunger. For every purchase of Street King, a portion of the sales will go to providing a daily meal to an underprivileged child around the world. The partnership coincides with Jackson's mission statement of feeding a billion people in Africa over the next five years: "50 Cent and I share a common vision: to address the world's problems through smart and sustainable business models," said Chris Clarke, the founder and CEO of Pure Growth Partners. "With the rampant starvation in Africa and hunger afflicting children worldwide, we need socially responsible businesses that affect real change now more than ever." Similarly, Jackson stated: "I'm inspired by Clarke's vision and innovative approaches to tackling serious issues. It's our mission with Street King to really change children's lives around the world."[106][107] Jackson founded SMS Audio, selling headphones with the name Street by 50. He has pledged to donate a portion of the sales to charity.[108]
In 2007, Jackson was the second wealthiest performer in the rap industry, behind Jay-Z.[109] He resides in Farmington, Connecticut, in the former mansion of ex-boxer Mike Tyson.[110] He is consistently ranked among the richest figures in the American hip hop scene. In 2014, Jackson was ranked the fifth richest figure in American hip hop with a net worth estimated at $140 million.[111]
In December 2008 Jackson told the Canadian press that he had been affected by the recession, losing several million dollars in the stock market as an investor. He also went on to say that he had been unable to sell his Connecticut mansion and pushed Before I Self-Destruct back because of the recent economic downturn.[112]
On July 21, 2012, Jackson moved into the sports entertainment business where he announced that he became a licensed boxing promoter, for his new company TMT, short for The Money Team. He acquired a license to promote in the state of New York and is in the process of being licensed in Nevada, where most of the major boxing events are held. As a former amateur boxer himself, Jackson has begun scouting for boxing talent. He has already signed gold medalist and former featherweight champion Yuriorkis Gamboa and middleweight, and former Olympic medalist Andre Dirrell.[113] On July 29, 2012, Jackson and his close friend Floyd Mayweather, Jr. signed IBF Featherweight Champion, Billy Dib. They also revealed plans to challenge MMA for box office dominance and change the landscape of boxing, with TMT Promotions.[114] The boxer Zab Judah stated a deal with 50 Cent, making him a possible fourth athlete signed to the company.[115]
In December 2012, Floyd Mayweather and Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson announced they had gone their separate ways with the latter taking over their promotions company. Jackson then founded a new promotion under the name SMS Promotions without the help of Mayweather.[116] Current boxer's signed to SMS are Yuriorkis Gamboa, Andre Dirrell, Billy Dib, James Kirkland (boxer), Luis Olivares and Donte Strayhorn.
In August 2005, shortly before appearing in Get Rich or Die Tryin', Jackson published an autobiography entitled From Pieces to Weight: Once upon a Time in Southside Queens. In it, Jackson explores the cultural and economic forces that led him to sell cocaine and crack, details his entrepreneurship as a drug-dealer and then as a rapper, and reflects on his own ethos and on society.
On January 4, 2007, Jackson launched his G-Unit Books imprint at the Time Warner Building.[121] He also co-wrote The Ski Mask Way, a novel about a small-time drug dealer who attempts to rob his employers, which is to be turned into a film.[99] Jackson said he read Robert Greene's The 33 Strategies of War and worked with the author on a book titled The 50th Law, an urban take on The 48 Laws of Power.[99][122] In May 2008, Jackson met billionaire Patrice Motsepe to forge a joint venture selling 50 Cent-branded platinum.[123]
In 2012 50 Cent signed a deal with Smarter Comics to produce his first graphic novel. The novel is a semi-autobiographical story about how people can obtain the life style of 50. The book is available online and through Amazon.[125]
On October 13, 1997, Jackson's then-girlfriend Shaniqua Tompkins gave birth to their only child, a son named Marquise Jackson.[2][126][127] The birth of Jackson's son Marquise changed his outlook on life. He stated: "When my son came into my life, my priorities changed, because I wanted to have the relationship with him, that I didn't have with my father."[128] He credited his son for inspiring his career and being "motivation to go in a different direction".[129]
He put the mansion for sale at $18.5 million to move closer to his son who lives in Long Island with his ex-girlfriend.[130] On October 12, 2007, the Mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut declared it "50 Cent Curtis Jackson Day". He was honored with a key to the city and an official proclamation.[131]
Jackson has a tattoo of "Marquise" with an axe on his right biceps. "The axe is 'cause I'm a warrior. I don't want him to be one, though,"[38] he explains. He also has "50", "Southside", and "Cold World" inscribed on his back because "I'm a product of that environment. It's on my back, though, so it's all behind me."[38]
On June 25, 2012, at around 11:18 p.m, 50 Cent was involved in a car accident on New York's Long Island Expressway. A Mack truck rear-ended the bullet-proof SUV in which he was traveling and almost caused his vehicle to flip over, reported the New York Post. 50 Cent suffered neck and back injuries, but was released from the hospital within hours. His unidentified driver was also hospitalized.[132]
In 2005, Jackson expressed support for President George W. Bush after rapper Kanye West criticized him for the slow response in assisting the Hurricane Katrina victims.[133] If his felony convictions did not prevent him from voting, he claimed he would have voted for Bush.[134] He later stated that Bush "has less compassion than the average human. By all means, I don't aspire to be like George Bush."[135] In September 2007, Jackson told Time magazine that he was not endorsing any candidate in 2008, but that he "liked Hillary," referring to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.[136] Six months later, the rapper told MTV news he had switched his support to Barack Obama after hearing him speak, but was generally not interested in politics.[137][138] When asked his view of President Barack Obama's May 9, 2012 endorsement of gay marriage, 50 Cent said "I'm for it," as well as "I've encouraged same-sex activities. I've engaged in fetish areas a couple times."[139] However, he has been criticized for anti-gay comments[140] and making jokes about anti-gay violence in the past.[140][141][142]
On June 29, 1994, Jackson was arrested for helping to sell four vials of cocaine to an undercover police officer. He was arrested again three weeks later when police searched his home and found heroin, ten ounces of crack cocaine, and a starter gun. He was sentenced to three to nine years in prison, but managed to serve six months in a shock incarceration boot camp where he earned his GED. Jackson said that he did not use cocaine himself, he only sold it.[13][143][144]
His ex-girlfriend Shaniqua Tompkins sued Jackson for $50 million, claiming that he said that he would take care of her for life; the suit, which includes 15 claims was later dismissed by a judge, calling it "an unfortunate tale of a love relationship gone sour."[145]
50 Cent was arrested on January 1, 2003 with four other members of his entourage. Police reportedly found two guns inside a parked car outside a Manhattan nightclub. The rapper, 27 at the time, was arrested shortly before 2 a.m. and charged with two counts of criminal possession of a weapon. Police conducted a search of the vehicle due to tinted windows. They recovered a .25 caliber handgun and a .45 caliber pistol.[146]
50 Cent was sentenced to two years probation on July 22, 2005 from an incident in May 2004 when 50 Cent jumped into the audience after being hit with a water bottle.[147] He was charged with three counts of assault and battery.[147]
In May 2008, one of his homes in New York purchased for 2.4 million dollars in January 2007 and at the center of a lawsuit between Jackson and ex-girlfriend Shaniqua Tompkins caught fire on May 30, 2008 while he was out of town filming for a movie in Louisiana.[148]
On August 5, 2013, 50 Cent entered a not guilty plea to domestic violence and vandalism charges in a Los Angeles Count court. He was charged with one count of domestic violence and four counts of vandalism. If convicted of all 5 charges, he could face up to 5 years in jail and $46,000 in fines. Model-actress Daphne Joy, accused 50 Cent of kicking her and ransacking the bedroom during an argument at her condo in the Toluca Lake neighborhood in Los Angeles on June 23. Authorities allege 50 Cent caused $7,100 in damage to property and left the scene before police arrived.[149]
On July 21, 2007, Jackson filed a $1 million lawsuit against advertising company Traffix Inc. of Pearl River, New York for using his image in a promotion which he claimed threatened his safety. He became aware of the Internet advertisement after one of his staff members saw it on a MySpace page. According to court documents, the advertisement features a cartoon image of the rapper and the message, "Shoot the rapper and you will win $5000 or five ring tones guaranteed". Although the advertisement did not use his name, the image allegedly intended to resemble him, suggesting he endorsed the product. The lawsuit calls it a "vile, tasteless and despicable" use of 50 Cent's image that "quite literally calls for violence against him". The lawsuit seeks for unspecified punitive damages and a permanent injunction against the use of his image without permission.[150][151]
In November 2009, 50 Cent won in a lawsuit against Taco Bell over the fast food chain using his name to promote the brand without his permission.[152]
Before signing with Interscope, Jackson engaged in a well-publicized dispute with rapper Ja Rule and his label The Inc.. Jackson claims that a friend robbed Ja Rule of his jewelry and that Ja Rule accused him of setting it up.[153] However, Ja Rule claimed the conflict stemmed from a video shoot in Queens because Jackson did not like seeing him "getting so much love" from the neighborhood.[154] In March 2000, while at The Hit Factory studio in New York, Jackson had an altercation with Murder Inc. associates. He was treated for three stitches after receiving a stab wound.[153][155] Rapper Black Child claimed responsibility for the stabbing, saying he acted in self-defense because he thought someone reached for a gun.[156]
An affidavit by an IRS agent suggested that Murder Inc. had ties to Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff, a New York drug lord who was suspected of being involved in the murder of Jam Master Jay and the shooting of Jackson. An excerpt of the affidavit read:
The investigation has uncovered a conspiracy involving McGriff and others to murder a rap artist who has released songs containing lyrics regarding McGriff's criminal activities. The rap artist was shot in 2000, survived and thereafter refused to cooperate with law enforcement regarding the shooting. Messages transmitted over the Murder Inc. pager indicate that McGriff is involved in an ongoing plot to kill this rap artist, and that he communicates with Murder Inc. employees concerning the target.[37]
In an interview with MTV, Ja Rule acknowledged his defeat against 50 Cent and stated that his 2009 album, The Mirror, will not be continuing any past feuds that he has engaged in. He said: There was a lot of things I wanted to say, and I didn't want there to be any bitter records on the album. Because I'm not bitter about anything that happened [in the past few years].
In May 2011, it was confirmed that both Ja Rule and 50 cent squashed the feud. Ja Rule said "I’m cool. We ain’t beefing no more. We’ll never collaborate. That’s just what it is. You don’t have to be at war with somebody, but it’s also kind of like U.S. and another country that they may not get along with. We don’t gotta go to war, but we’re not friends either. But we can coincide inside of a world. He’s doing him, and he’s not thinking about me, and I’m doing me and I’m not thinking about him."[157]
Although he was close with The Game, before The Game released his debut album The Documentary, they soon became at odds. After its release, Jackson felt The Game was disloyal for saying he did not want to participate in G-Unit's feuds with other rappers and even wanting to work with artists they were feuding with. He also claimed that he wrote six songs on the album and was not receiving proper credit for his work, which The Game denied.[158]
Jackson later dismissed The Game from G-Unit on Hot 97 radio. After the announcement, The Game, who was a guest earlier in the evening, attempted to enter the building with his entourage. After being denied entry, one of his associates was shot in the leg during a confrontation with a group of men leaving the building.[159][160] When the situation escalated, both rappers held a press conference to announce their reconciliation.[161] Fans had mixed feelings as to whether the rappers created a publicity stunt to boost the sales of the albums they had just released.[162] Nevertheless, even after the situation deflated,[163] G-Unit criticized The Game's street credibility. The group denounced The Game and announced that they will not be featured on his albums. During a Summer Jam performance, The Game launched a boycott of G-Unit called "G-Unot".[164]
After the performance at Summer Jam, The Game responded with "300 Bars and Runnin'", an extended "diss" aimed at G-Unit as well as members of Roc-A-Fella Records on the mixtape You Know What It Is Vol. 3. Jackson responded through his "Piggy Bank" music video, which features The Game as a Mr. Potato Head doll and also parodies other rivals.[165] Since then both groups continued to attack each other. The Game released two more mixtapes, Ghost Unit and a mixtape/DVD called Stop Snitchin, Stop Lyin.
Jackson posted a cover of The Game's head on the body of a male stripper for "Hate It or Love It (G-Unit Radio Part 21)" mixtape, as a response to The Game displaying pictures of G-Unit dressed as Village People.[166] Although he was signed to Aftermath Entertainment, The Game left the label and signed with Geffen Records to terminate his contractual obligations with G-Unit (although others claim Jackson pressured Dr. Dre to kick him off).[167] G-Unit member Spider Loc had also began to insult The Game on various songs. In addition, The Game released "240 Bars (Spider Joke)" and "100 Bars (The Funeral)" both attacking G-Unit, Spider Loc and others. Jackson's response was "Not Rich, Still Lyin'" where he mocks The Game.[168] Lloyd Banks replied to the Game on a Rap City freestyle booth session. The Game quickly released a "diss" record called "SoundScan" where The Game pokes fun at Lloyd Banks' album Rotten Apple falling thirteen spots on the Billboard 200 chart and disappointing second week sales. Lloyd Banks replied on his mixtape Mo' Money In The Bank Pt. 5: Gang Green Season Continues with a song called "Showtime (The Game's Over)". Lloyd Banks states that Jackson wrote half of The Game's first album The Documentary and pokes fun at The Game's suicidal thoughts.
In October 2006, The Game extended a peace treaty to Jackson, which was not immediately replied to.[169] However, a couple days later, on Power 106, he stated that the treaty was only offered for one day.[170] On The Game's album, Doctor's Advocate, he claims that the feud is over on a few of the songs.
In July 2009, The Game stated the beef was squashed with help from Michael Jackson and Diddy,[171] and he apologized for his actions during the beef.[172] Tony Yayo said that neither Jackson (50 Cent) or G-Unit would accept his apology.[173] Since then, The Game continued his old "G-Unot" ways at live concerts. Jackson released "So Disrespectful" a diss song on Before I Self Destruct targeting Jay-Z, The Game and Young Buck.[174] Game later responded with the song "Shake", poking fun of the music video for 50's single "Candy Shop", quote, "Me and 50 aint agreeing on shit so I had to (Shake) Aint no telling what he putting in that protein (Shake) Seen the candy shop video look at this nigga (Shake) And thats the same shit that made the nigga Young Buck (Shake)". He also takes shots at Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo, in which he says, "I'm surprised that Lloyd Banks and Yayo didn't (Shake) Wasn't selling no records Jimmy Iovine said (Shake)". Game also dissed G-Unit several times on the song "400 Bars".
In September 2011, 50 Cent dissed Game on the song "Love, Hate, Love", in which Game responded to on his Twitter, saying he was going to diss him back after his tour was finished, quote:
[@50Cent I'm on tour doin shows but as soon as @avanterose find a studio for me i'm killin yo "Planet of the Apes" face havin ass nigga
In January 2009, Rick Ross started a feud with 50 Cent because he supposedly looked at him the wrong way at the BET Awards. However, Jackson told news sources that he did not even remember seeing Rick Ross there.[175] In late January, a track entitled "Mafia Music" by Rick Ross, leaked onto the Internet. There were several lines that seem to diss Jackson. Days later, Jackson released "Officer Ricky (Go Head, Try Me)" in response to Rick Ross's disparaging remarks on his "Mafia Music" song. The next day Rick Ross appeared on Shade 45, and told Jackson to come up with something better in 24 hours.
Before going to Venezuela, Jackson uploaded a video entitled "Warning Shot", where he warns Rick Ross: "I'ma fuck your life up for fun". In addition, Jackson released the first of a series of "Officer Ricky" cartoons. Early February, Jackson once again made a video which he uploaded to YouTube where he interviews "Tia", the mother of one of Rick Ross's children. She verifies his being a correctional officer and claims his whole persona is fake and fraudulent.[176] On Thursday, February 5, 2009, The Game, who Jackson has a long-standing "beef" with, called up Seattle's KUBE 93 Radio Station. When asked about the beef between Jackson and Rick Ross, The Game sided with Jackson and said that things are not looking good for Rick Ross. However, he offered to help Rick Ross get out of this situation, stating "Rick Ross, holla at your boy, man," and "50 eating you, boy."[177]
On his album Deeper Than Rap, Ross references Jackson in the song "In Cold Blood". A video for the song was released that portrayed Jackson's mock funeral. Upon release, Ross stated that he has ended Jackson's career.[178]
In an interview, Jackson said: "Rick Ross is Albert From CB4. You ever seen the movie? He's Albert," he added. "It never gets worse than this. You get a guy that was a correctional officer come out and base his entire career on writing material from a drug dealer's perspective such as "Freeway" Ricky Ross."[179]
Their feud was reignited recently at the 2012 BET Hip Hop Awards. Members of G-Unit (Kidd Kidd, Mike Knox, Tony Yayo) and 50 Cent are seen on video beating up Gunplay, a member of Rick Ross' Maybach Music Group. Gunplay's Maybach Music diamond necklace was also taken during the brawl. Days later, 50 Cent made an appearance at a bowling alley in Washington D.C. sporting his chain.[180]
On January 30, 2013, 50 Cent claimed via Twitter that the drive-by shooting that Rick Ross experienced on his birthday two days ago was "staged," reigniting the feud again.[181]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Born in the South Jamaica section of Queens, Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson has lived in New York City all his life. Raised by his grandparents after his father ran out and his mother was shot when he was only eight. Growing up, the Queens rapper originally wanted to be a heavyweight boxer, but eventually fell back on rapping. DJs had taken it upon themselves to release two Best of 50 Cent mix CDs, before he had even signed to a major label. 50 Cent hit the scene with "How To Rob" and he's been on a rampage ever since dealing with bootleggers, label back stabbing and other platinum selling artists trying to get at him physically. In 1999 his album Power of the Dollar, was heavily bootlegged and Trackmasters/Columbia never released it. Supposedly, Trackmasters weren't comfortable with him being caught up in the streets and getting shot three days before filming the video for "Thug Love," (with Destiny's Child) -- his first single. 50 was shot three times that night, two shots hitting him in the head, the bullet that struck his face he carries as a reminder of what happened. That event led to the fall out with Columbia and negotiating his release from their grasps. He still showed love and rhymed over a Trackmasters produced remix of "I'm Gonna Be Alright" on J-Lo's latest album, but rivals at Murder Inc. had 50 cut from the track which could have launched the rapper. This all changed in one night when Eminem said on a radio show that "50 Cent is definitely my favorite rapper right now, he's the only one keeping it real." The very next day a bidding war started on 50, ending when 50 signed to Eminem's very own label Shady/Aftermath. 50 Cent's fame has exploded, being produced by Dr. Dre and Eminem and finally making his debut album "Get rich or Die Tryin'." 50 has full access and advantage of the streets through mix-tapes; that's his forum because he controls it. 50 Cent is the most anticipated artist of 2003. It's well deserved because he's "been patiently waiting."
      His debut album "Get Rich or Die Tryin'" was the highest debut ever with 900,000 copies sold in the first week.
      He bought former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson's Farmington, CT, mansion for $4.1 million. The house is approximately 50,000 sq. ft., has 52 rooms and was bought by Tyson for $2.7 million in 1996. Its features include five Jacuzzis, 25 full baths, 18 bedrooms, an elevator, two billiard rooms, a movie theater and a locker room.
      Recorded an album in 1999 titled "Power of the Dollar" but it was shelved by Columbia Records due to his legal problems at the time.
      Released a series of street mixtapes in 2002. They became so popular that Eminem heard them and signed him to his record label. Even after his success, 50 still releases street mixtapes on a regular basis.
      Album "The Massacre" was originally titled "St. Valentine's Day Massacre" and set for a February 15 release date, but production problems forced it to be set back to March 8.
      His cartoon-like photo on the cover of his album "The Massacre" was meant to make him look like a Ninja Turtle, his son's favorite cartoon characters. He is also a fan of the cartoon, his favorite turtle being Donatello.
      His group, G-Unit, includes Tony Yayo, and Lloyd Banks. Young Buck and Game were once members but a well-publicized feud developed.
      Jackson was hurt in a car crash on New York's Long Island Expressway on the night of June 25, 2012. A Mack truck rear-ended the bullet-proof SUV that he was traveling in and almost caused his vehicle to flip over, reported the New York Post. Jackson suffered neck and back injuries, but was released from the hospital within hours. His unidentified driver was also hospitalized.
      Currently touring everywhere possible with artists like Busta Rhymes, Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z, Sean Paul, Chingy, and Bone Crusher on the Roc Tha Mic Tour. [June 2003]
      Re-released "The Massacre" with an additional DVD of music videos for each song. [November 2005]
      Currently filming a motion picture called "Home of the Brave" with Jessica Biel and Samuel L. Jackson. [March 2006]
      Finishing up sophomore album entitled "The Massacre" scheduled for a March 2005 release [January 2005]
      [on his feud with rapper Ja Rule] Right now he's desperate. He should be talking about me, not Eminem and [Dr. Dre] and everybody else. He'll lose, he knows that. The route that he has to take is the "I'm a mad gangsta" hardcore route, and ain't nobody gonna believe him.
      In Hollywood they say there's no business like show business. In the hood they say there's no business like ho' business.
      A man becomes as attractive as an attractive woman when he becomes successful and is publicly noted. Power's an aphrodisiac.
      I think it's easier for the general public to embrace me in a negative way. You have people who already have a perception of me that says I'm a bad person.
      I don't display emotions. I have every feeling that everyone else has but I've developed ways to suppress them. Anger is one of my most comfortable feelings.
      In my neighborhood if you're too aggressive, you intimidate someone, they kill you. Or if you decide to be emotional and you start crying, you're a victim. You know, the kid in the schoolyard that doesn't want to fight always leaves with a black eye. You have to find a way to stay in the middle, somewhere where people just don't mess with you because they know that you don't have a problem with it if it goes there.
      [on his feuds with many of his fellow rappers, such as Nas, Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Shyne, Game, Ja Rule, Sheek Louch and Styles P., among others] If they keep comin' at me, I'll just keep responding back until they don't exist anymore. I got the time and energy to ruin what is left of their careers, if they want to do that.
      A lot of kids join the army to get a college education. That's why they do it, and they get sent into these horrible situations.
      I got a chance to watch a lot of my mother's sisters and brothers at different periods experiment with the use of drugs or alcohol and I see them respond so differently that I stay away...I've had an experience (with alcohol) that made me paranoid because of it and I stayed away from it following that.

50 Cent was one of the biggest stars hip-hop produced in the 2000s, a muscled and menacing, yet imperturbably cool presence with a near-mythic backstory. The protégé of Dr. Dre and Eminem, 50 Cent made music that was both gangsta and good fun. His 2003 debut, the nine-times-platinum Get Rich or Die Tryin', made him a star. Though his popularity diminished somewhat by the end of decade, 50 Cent's bank account didn't suffer since he also spent the 2000s establishing himself as a hip-hop entrepreneur. 
He was born Curtis Jackson in Queens, NY, on July 6, 1975, and was raised by his single mother, a crack dealer, until she was murdered when he was eight. Living with his grandparents, 50 Cent competed as an amateur boxer but soon became a crack dealer himself. Jackson was arrested while in 10th grade, but by eighteen, he was making $5,000 a day selling crack and heroin. 
50 Cent began rapping in high scool. In 1996, a friend introduced him to Run-D.M.C.'s Jam Master Jay, who was starting a record label, JMJ Records. Jay produced an album for 50, though it went unreleased.  50 later recorded an album for Columbia Records in 2000, Power of the Dollar. (The label declined to release that one, too, though it's been heavily bootlegged.) 
In April of that year, 50 Cent was shot nine times outside his grandmother's home; in a 2003 cover story for Rolling Strone, Touré chronicled the aftermath of the shooting: "[50] spent thirteen days in the hospital, then staggered out on a walker. Six weeks later, he began walking on his own. Now life was more precious to him. He began working on his body with endless push-ups, pull-ups and sit-ups that turned him from kinda fat to chiseled. But more important for an MC, there was now a large, squarish hole through the left side of his lower jaw and a piece of bullet left in his tongue. He'd lost a bottom tooth and a U-shaped chunk of his gums, but his lazy tongue and the hole in his jaw gave him a slur like no one in hip-hop. 'There's a different sound now when I talk, 'cause of the air around the tooth,' 50 says. 'Gettin' shot just totally fixed my instrument.'"
50 set about releasing a cavalcade of menacing, diss-heavy mixtapes —  No Mercy, No Fear, recorded with his G-Unit crew in 2002, is one of the best.  50 soon caught the attention of Eminem, who touted 50 as "the illest motherfucker in the world." Along with partner Dr. Dre, Eminem signed 50 to Shady Records and Aftermath Entertainment. While gearing up for his debut, 50 released Guess Who's Back?, a commercially available collection of his early work that finds a middle ground between the off-the-cuff rhymes of his mixtapes and the more polished assault of his official studio albums.
Get Rich or Die Tryin' had a boatload of advance buzz; a feud with rapper Ja Rule also helped 50 increase his profile. Nobody seemed surprised when became a blockbuster. "Wanksta," one of Jam Master Jay's last productions, and the Dre-produced party anthem "In Da Club" tore up the pop charts, and the album was full of slick, powerful hooks—the half-sung, half-shouted chants of "Life's on the Line," the slick steel drum on "P.I.M.P." 50 gets stoned, gets laid and fires off gunshots like it's nothing, all the while employing a steady, laid-back cadence. 
After conquering the world, 50 became a business, scoring his own G-Unit clothing line, his own PlayStation game, a semi-biographical movie (also called Get Rich or Die Tryin'), and even his own Vitamin Water flavor. His record label, G-Unit, released a stream of high-profile, no-bullshit gangsta rap from The Game, and a handful of releases from his G-Unit stable. On Forbes magazine's 2007 list of "Hip Hop Cash Kings," 50, worth $32 million, ranked second behind Jay-Z. 
But while 50's profile remained high, his modus operandi of "get even richer or die trying" had a deleterious affect on his music. On The Massacre, 50 leaned on his "cuddly thug" persona, serenely seething about cocaine coming out of his pores but also luring girls into the "Candy Shop," crooning to strippers on "Disco Inferno" or getting downright goofy with Eminem on "Gatman And Robbin'." The album debuted at Number One
By 2007's Curtis, 50's appeal had slipped. The album was released the same day as Kanye West's Graduation, and SoundScan showed that rap fans in 2007 were definitely more eager to lap up West's self-introspection than 50's circa-2003 bullets-and-braggadocio. 2009's Before I Self Destruct should have been received as 50's triumphant comeback record — but this no-fanfare, all-meat-no-gristle record didn't receive nearly as much buzz as past 50 albums.

Though he would later struggle with the nature of his fame as well as market expectations, 50 Cent endured substantial obstacles throughout his young yet remarkably dramatic life before becoming the most discussed figure in rap, if not pop music in general, circa 2003. Following an unsuccessful late-'90s run at mainstream success (foiled by an attempt on his life in 2000) and a successful run on the New York mixtape circuit (driven by his early-2000s bout with Ja Rule), Eminem signed 50 Cent to a seven-figure contract in 2002 and helmed his quick rise toward crossover success in 2003. The product of a broken home in the rough Jamaica neighborhood of Queens and, in turn, the storied hood's hustling streets themselves, 50 Cent lived everything most rappers write rhymes about but not all actually experience: drugs, crimes, imprisonments, stabbings, and most infamously of all, shootings. Of course, such experiences became 50 Cent's rhetorical stock-in-trade. He reveled in his oft-told past, he called out wannabe gangstas, and he made headlines. He even looked like the ideal East Coast hardcore rapper: big-framed with oft-showcased biceps, abs, and tattoos as well as his trademark bulletproof vest, pistol, and iced crucifix. But all-importantly, 50 Cent may have fit the mold of a prototypical hardcore rapper, but he could also craft a catchy hook. As a result, his music crossed over to the pop market, appealing to both those who liked his roughneck posturing and rags-to-riches story as well as those who liked his knack for churning out naughty singalong club tracks. And too, 50 Cent didn't forget about his posse. He helped his G-Unit crew grow into a successful franchise, spawning platinum-selling solo albums for his group members, lucrative licensing deals for the brand name, and sell-out arena tours to promote the franchise internationally. By the time of his third album (Curtis, 2007), however, 50 Cent faced a formidable backlash, particularly among hip-hop purists, who were displeased by his turn toward crossover pop-rap and thus away from street-level credibility. 
Born Curtis James Jackson III on July 6, 1975, and raised in Southside Jamaica, Queens, New York City, 50 Cent grew up in a broken home. His hustler mother passed away when he was only eight, and his father departed soon after, leaving his grandmother to parent him. As a teen, he followed the lead of his mother and began hustling. The crack trade proved lucrative for 50 Cent, until he eventually encountered the law, that is, and got arrested repeatedly in 1994. It's around this point in time that he traded crime for hip-hop. His break came in 1996 when he met Run-D.M.C.'s Jam Master Jay, who gave him a tape of beats and asked him to rap over it. Impressed by what he heard, Jay signed the aspiring rapper to his JMJ Records label. Not much resulted from the deal, though, and 50 Cent affiliated himself with Trackmasters, a commercially successful New York-based production duo known for their work with such artists as Nas and Jay-Z. Trackmasters signed the rapper to their Columbia sublabel and began work on his debut album, Power of the Dollar. A trio of singles preceded the album's proposed release: "Your Life's on the Line," "Thug Love" (featuring Destiny's Child), and "How to Rob." The latter generated a significant buzz, attracting a lot of attention for its baiting lyrics, which detail how 50 Cent would rob specific big-name rappers. This willingness to rap openly and brashly and the attention it attracted came back to haunt him, however. His first post-success brush with death came shortly after the release of "How to Rob," when he was stabbed at the Hit Factory studio on West 54th Street in Manhattan. Shortly afterward came his most storied incident. On May 24, 2000, just before Columbia was set to release Power of the Dollar, an assassin attempted to take 50 Cent's life on 161st Street in Jamaica, Queens (near where Jam Master Jay would later be fatally shot two and half years later), shooting him nine times with a 9mm pistol while the rapper sat helpless in the passenger seat of a car. One shot pierced his cheek, another his hand, and the seven others his legs and thighs, yet he survived, barely. Even so, Columbia wanted nothing to do with 50 Cent when they heard the news, shelving Power of the Dollar and parting ways with the now-controversial rapper. 
During the next two years, 50 Cent returned to the rap underground where he began. He formed a collective (G-Unit, which also featured Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo), worked closely with producer Sha Money XL (who had also been signed to JMJ around the same time that 50 Cent had), and began churning out mixtapes (selections from which were later compiled on Guess Who's Back? in 2002). These mixtape recordings (many of which were hosted by DJ Whoo Kid on CDs such as No Mercy, No Fear and Automatic Gunfire), earned the rapper an esteemed reputation on the streets of New York. Some of them featured 50 Cent and his G-Unit companions rapping over popular beats, others mocked popular rappers (namely Ja Rule, who quickly became an arch-rival), and a few discussed his shooting. This constant mixtape presence throughout 2000-2002 garnered industry attention as well as street esteem, particularly when Eminem declared on a radio show his admiration for 50 Cent. A bidding war ensued, driving up the signing price into the million-plus figures in the process and slowly moving the rapper into the up-and-coming spotlight once again as word spread. Despite the bidding war, Eminem indeed got his man, signing 50 Cent to a joint deal with Shady/Aftermath -- the former label Em's, the latter Dr. Dre's. During the successive months, 50 Cent worked closely with Eminem and Dre, who were both credited as executive produced on his upcoming debut, Get Rich or Die Tryin', each of them producing a few tracks for the highly awaited album. Before Get Rich dropped, though, Eminem debuted 50 Cent on the 8 Mile soundtrack. The song "Wanksta," previously released on the No Mercy, No Fear mixtape, became a runaway hit in late 2002, setting the stage for "In da Club," the Dre-produced lead single from Get Rich. The two singles became sizable crossover hits -- the former peaking at number 13 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, the latter at number one -- and Interscope (Shady/Aftermath's parent company) consequently had to move up Get Rich's release date to combat bootlegging. 
Amid all this, 50 Cent made headlines repeatedly. Most notably, he was tied to Jam Master Jay's shooting in October 2002, the F.B.I.'s investigation of Murder Inc's relationship to former drug dealer Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff, and a shooting incident at the offices of Violator Management. Furthermore, he made more headlines when he was jailed on New Year's Eve 2002 for gun possession. The media recounted his life story ad nauseam, particularly his storied brush with death -- and not just the expected media outlets like MTV -- even such unlikely mainstream publications as The New York Times ran feature stories ("Amid Much Anticipation, a Rapper Makes a Debut"). By the time Get Rich finally streeted on February 6, 2003, 50 Cent had become the most discussed figure in the music industry, and bootlegged or not, his initial sales figures reflected this (a record-breaking 872,000 units moved in five days, the best-selling debut album since SoundScan started its tracking system in May 1991), as did his omnipresence in the media. Late in the year, following another round of popular hits, "21 Questions" (which charted number one on the Hot 100) and "P.I.M.P." (number three), 50 Cent made his group debut with G-Unit, Beg for Mercy. The album charted at number two and spawned a couple Top 15 hits, "Stunt 101" and "Wanna Get to Know You." In 2004, 50 Cent stayed on the sidelines for the most part as G-Unit affiliates Lloyd Banks and Young Buck released popular solo albums. Another G-Unit affiliate, the Game, released his debut in January 2005, and it proved the most successful among these solo spin-offs, in particular the singles "How We Do" and "Love It or Hate It," both Top Five hits that prominently featured 50 Cent. As these singles were riding high on the charts, however, 50 Cent and the Game were feuding, and the latter was acrimoniously booted out of G-Unit. There were also feuds with Fat Joe and Jadakiss (instigated by the song "Piggy Bank") during the run-up to the March 2005 release of The Massacre, 50 Cent's second album. Nearly as popular as Get Rich or Die Tryin', The Massacre debuted at number one, sold millions (over ten million worldwide), and spawned a series of smash hits ("Disco Inferno," "Candy Shop," "Just a Lil Bit"). 
By this point in time, 50 Cent's fame overshadowed his music, thereby predicating "street" credibility issues that would haunt him in the years to follow. For instance, the marketing rollout of The Massacre carried over into ventures such as the video game 50 Cent: Bulletproof, the semi-autobiographical film Get Rich or Die Tryin', and the soundtrack to that film -- all released in 2005, along with other product. The fallout from 50 Cent's overexposure was evident via the singles from the film soundtrack ("Hustler's Ambition," "Window Shopper," "Best Friend," "Have a Party"), which failed to gain much traction in the marketplace, charting modestly relative to past singles. The next round of G-Unit solo releases (Tony Yayo's Thoughts of a Predicate Felon, 2005; Mobb Deep's Blood Money, 2005; Lloyd Banks' Rotten Apple, 2006; Young Buck's Buck the World, 2007) didn't perform commercially well, either, and it's wasn't entirely surprising when plans for another, Olivia's Behind Closed Doors, were shelved. The grim outlook didn't bode well for 50 Cent's next album, which was pushed back repeatedly and retitled a couple times. The final title, Curtis, was inspired by yet another feud, this one with Cam'ron, who taunted 50 Cent, somewhat oddly, by addressing him by his born name. After a pair of lead singles, "Straight to the Bank" and "Amusement Park," failed to connect in the marketplace, Curtis was reworked one last time and pushed back from a summer release date to a fall one (i.e., the memorable date September 11, which -- to the glee of industry observers -- pitted the album against Kanye West's Graduation). A second round of singles, "I Get Money" and "Ayo Technology," was released in the latter half of the summer, while the video for a fifth single, "Follow My Lead," was leaked to the Internet -- to the frustration of 50 Cent, who reportedly cursed out Interscope for endangering the commercial prospects of his album -- over a month before street date. ~ Jason Birchmeier, Rovi

Biography50 Cent (born Curtis James Jackson, 6.7.1975)50 Cent is an American rapper whose albums Get Rich Or Die Tryin' and The Massacre have both achieved multi-platinum status.50 Cent's ChildhoodCurtis Jackson was born in the Queens suburb of New York to Sabrina Jackson, a drug dealer. She died when Curtis was 8, when he was sent to live with his grandparents. Despite a disadvantaged start in life, Curtis Jackson competed in the Junior Olympics as an amateur boxer in the mid-1980's.	However, he began dealing drugs during the 1980's crack epidemic, aged 12.)Jackson was arrested in 1994 for selling cocaine to an undercover police officer. He was sentenced to three to nine years in prison but served only six months in an incarceration boot camp.The nickname '50 Cent' was adopted as a metaphor for change. He took the name from a robber in the 1980s named Kelvin Martin, whose nickname was also 50 Cent.In 2000, when he had quit dealing to pursue a music career, he was shot nine times.50 Cent's Musical Career50 Cent started out rapping in a friend's basement. When he was introduced to Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC, Jay taught him to count bars, structure songs and record tracks.Jay produced his first record, though it was never released. In 1999, though, best-selling producers Trackmasters became interested in 50 Cent and signed him to Columbia Records. They recorded 36 songs in two weeks, half of which became the unofficially released album Power of the Dollar (2000). The controversial song 'How To Rob' earned him a support slot on Nas' tour.50 Cent was then picked up by US rapper Eminem, who introduced him to Dr Dre, (who went on to produce 50 Cent's music) and signed him to Interscope Records, after he heard 50 Cent's debut album, Guess Who's Back?Helped by Eminem and Dr. Dre, who produced his next album, 50 Cent became on the best-selling rap artists in the world. A new track, 'Wanksta' was included on the soundtrack to Eminem's film, 8 Mile and he also signed to Chris Lighty's Violator Management and Sha Money XL's Money Management Group.His first commercial album, Get Rich Or Die Tryin' was released in 2003. The album debuted at number one in the Billboard 200 and sold 872,000 in the first four days alone.Interscope Records granted 50 Cent license to set up his own label, G-Unit Records. G-Unit released tracks by Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck and later, rap veterans Mobb Deep.	50 Cent released his second commercial album in 2005. Entitled The Massacre, it sold 1.4 million copies in the first four days and again reached number one in the Billboard 200.The third album by 50 Cent, Curtis was released in 2007. The album was said to be inspired by his life before becoming a famous rap artist. It debuted at number two in the Billboard 200 charts and his wealth was recognized by Forbes which placed him second behind Jay-Z in the rap industry.50 Cent's Private Life50 Cent has been involved in a well-publicised feud with rapper Ja Rule and his label Murder Inc. Records. Engaging in various 'disses' via the medium of their own mixtapes, 50 Cent claimed that the feud began when Ja Rule spotted 50 Cent with a man who had robbed him of his jewellery. Ja Rule, on the other hand, claimed that it stemmed from aa video shoot in Queens, because 50 Cent could not stand Ja Rule getting so much respect from the neighbourhood.In 2005, 50 Cent went on to start a feud with G-Unit rapper The Game. He felt that The Game was disloyal for refusing to back G-Unit in their dispute with other rappers and was also trying to work with rappers that they were feuding with. 50 Cent dismissed the Game from G-Unit on Hot 97 radio. G-Unit attempted to enter the radio building and one of his associates was shot in the leg during the attempt. They eventually were reconciled, and many fans wondered if the whole debacle was a publicity stunt.50 Cent now lives in Farrington, Connecticut in the former home of Mike Tyson. His son lives in Long Island with 50 Cent's ex-girlfriend. The Mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut declared October 12 2007 "50 Cent Curtis Jackson Day."

How do you contact any of these people to assist you with either meeting your child and/or assisting in getting the word out to assist in saving your childs life? I have a 22 year old who was born with a complex congenital heart defect and polycystic disease. He has had multiple surgical corrections but after many leaps and bounds his heart has been holding up but his kidneys have not. My son as with many young adults these days has this obsession with many of the rappers and the lifestyles they portray as reality. Due to his condition he was homeschooled for the vast majority of his child hood due to many hospitalizations and because the NYC school system had a fear of what could occur.. as did I. So socialization was limited to the neighborhood in Astoria where we stayed until he was 18 because I could not bring myself to leave because of my fears and needed to be close to the better Hospitals. 2 years ago he was added to the list for a Kidney, however UNOs does not have special perimeters .. his heart defect and other issues are not there concern only a list of individuals in a line. NEXT.. the fact that he only has 3 chambers and special tubing to circulate blood doesn't matter, nor that dialysis will probably elevate his blood pressure and kill him. Because polycystic kidneys is hereditary disease all of the family members on my mother's side carry the same gene and we all have one form of the disease we cannot donate and all other family members have diabetes, hypertension, etc. Then there are the long list of his "BOYS" that were always so willing to help until he really needed it. It is a hard lesson to learn for any normal person that you really do not has friends but even harder for a person that didn't have a social life until 15 and wanted only to be normal. Didn't care if people perceived him as different things since he was so skinny and drawn because he didn't want pity, or anyone to think he was weak because he has a severe congenital heart defect and a kidney disorder. I have tried for 2 1/2 years to obtain a donor using social media and word of mouth, well I have had several people ask me for large sums of money and then several stalk me and tell me I was killing my son by not paying them, then I had several people string me and even worse him along for extended periods of time.. stating they went for testing meeting etc. well they never did. My son is now in the last stage of renal failure. He has not only lost an extensive amount of weight that he couldn't afford to but his breathing and actions have changed. They will try dialysis if they have the opportunity however the prognosis is not good .. he does not want to die but has been forced to deal with it as even living on dialysis if possible is just not living to him. 50 cent has been a person he really looks up to not only for the music but how he has over come many obstacles and is a self made man. But there are many others he respects. I am his mother so of course I want him to live but even more importantly I want him to be happy. Not being able to help your child is the worst feeling in the world and for 22 years it has beaten me down. I am not proud of that and I am hoping someone out there in this world is still good.
