Jessica Ann Simpson (born July 10, 1980) is an American recording artist,[2] actress, television personality and fashion designer who made her debut in 1999. Since that time, Simpson has made many recordings, starred in several television shows, movies and commercials, launched a line of hair and beauty products and designed fragrances, shoes and handbags for women. She has devoted time to philanthropic efforts including Operation Smile and a USO-hosted tour for troops stationed overseas. She started the Jessica Simpson Collection in 2006.
Simpson rose to fame with the release of her debut single, "I Wanna Love You Forever", which peaked inside the Top 5 of the Billboard Hot 100.[4] Subsequently, her debut album Sweet Kisses went on to be certified 2x Platinum in the United States, and sold over four million copies worldwide. Her 2001 single "Irresistible" became her second Top 20 hit, while the album of the same name became her first to enter the Top 10 of the Billboard 200, and went on to receive a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Her third studio album, In This Skin, went on to become her best selling album worldwide, receiving a 3x Platinum certification from the RIAA and peaking at number 2 on the Billboard 200, her highest charting album to date. Following the release of a Christmas album, Simpson released A Public Affair in 2006, and the album became her third Top 10 hit on the Billboard 200. She ventured into the country music market in 2008 and released Do You Know. In October 2010, she released her first compilation album and last album under the label of Epic Records, with the name Playlist: The Very Best of Jessica Simpson. A month later she released her second Christmas album Happy Christmas under the label eleveneleven and Primary Wave Records (owned by EMI). She has achieved seven Billboard Top 40 hits, three gold and two multi-platinum RIAA certified studio albums, four of which have reached the top 10 on the US Billboard 200.[5][6] Simpson has sold over 30 million albums worldwide.[7] In 2013, VH1 ranked Simpson #32 on their 100 Sexiest Artists of All Time list.[8]
Starting in 2003, Simpson starred with her then-husband Nick Lachey in the MTV reality show Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica. The show aired from 2003 to 2005. After her divorce from Lachey, Simpson appeared in films including The Dukes of Hazzard (2005), Employee of the Month (2006), and Private Valentine: Blonde & Dangerous (2008). Simpson was featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The View, The Price of Beauty, and The Early Show. Her appearances on The Price of Beauty gained generally positive reception, pulling in 1 million viewers on its premiere. The show was also nominated for a Teen Choice Award. She also recorded the show's theme song, "Who We Are".
Jessica Ann Simpson was born July 10, 1980, in Abilene, Texas, the daughter of Joe Simpson, a minister and psychologist, and Tina Simpson.[9] She has a younger sister, Ashlee, who is also a singer. Simpson's father gave her a purity ring at the age of 12, and Simpson has often stated she remained a virgin until marriage.[10] Her parents were married in 1978 and filed for divorce in 2012.[11][12] Their divorce was finalized in 2013.[13][14] Simpson has stated that she grew up in Dallas, but her parents now live in McGregor, Texas.[15]
Simpson began singing at a local Baptist church, where her father also worked as the congregation's youth minister. At age twelve, she unsuccessfully auditioned for The Mickey Mouse Club.[16] Simpson has stated that they were put in groups and had acting and vocal coaches to help them. According to Jessica, Justin Timberlake was in a group with her. She explained that she had frozen after getting on stage to sing, and later commented that she had felt "intimidated" by the other performers. The following year, Simpson attended a church camp, where she sang Dolly Parton's "I Will Always Love You" and an arrangement of "Amazing Grace".[17] At the camp, she was introduced to the founder of Proclaim Records, a minor Gospel music record label. She recorded an album, Jessica, but she was dismissed from the label when it went bankrupt. Jessica was never officially released except for a small pressing funded by her grandmother.[18][19] When Simpson was sixteen years old, Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola heard Jessica. Mottola was impressed with Simpson’s musical talent and skill. Simpson was immediately signed to the label. She dropped out of J. J. Pearce High School but later earned her GED.[20][21]
Simpson began working with producers such as Louis Biancaniello, Robbie Nevil, Evan Rogers, and Cory Rooney. Biancaniello worked with Simpson on three of the albums eleven tracks, including "I Wanna Love You Forever", "Where You Are", and "Heart of Innocence". Rooney produced the track "I Think I'm in Love with You", which was later released as the album's third single. During this time, Simpson began dating Nick Lachey. Simpson and Lachey recorded a duet, "Where You Are", which later became the album's second single.[22] She also worked with Destiny's Child.
Simpson also collaborated with Sam Watters for the album. Watters produced the singles "I Wanna Love You Forever" and "Where You Are", as well as "Heart of Innocence". Watters also co-wrote the track "I Wanna Love You Forever", along with Louis Biancaniello. Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers also produced the tracks "I've Got My Eyes On You" and "Betcha She Don't Love You" together, though neither tracks were released as singles. Simpson's label wanted Sweet Kisses to be different from Aguilera's and Spears' debut albums, in that they were sexually risque, especially the lead singles from both albums.[citation needed] For Sweet Kisses, the label decided they wanted Simpson to be the "anti-sex appeal", to which Simpson would sing about love and romance rather than sexual themes. Simpson's "virgin" image was thought as a great idea by the label, who felt that it would draw in listeners by making a girl whom they could relate to. Simpson also announced in an interview that she would be abstinent until marriage, which helped listeners give her the appearance the label was hoping for.[23]
Simpson's debut single, "I Wanna Love You Forever", was released on September 28, 1999. The single entered the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 3.[24] "I Wanna Love You Forever" went on to be certified Platinum by the RIAA less than three months after its release.[25] Outside of the United States, the single was successful, as it peaked within the top ten in most European nations and Australia, which reached the Top-ten in Norway, Sweden, UK, Switzerland, Belgium, Canada and Australia.[26][27][28][29] Simpson's debut album, Sweet Kisses, was released on November 23, 1999. The album debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200, selling 65,000 copies in its first week,[30] significantly lower than expected by Columbia Records.[citation needed] To boost record sales, the label released the second single "Where You Are", but could not reach the success of its predecessor "I Wanna Love You Forever".[citation needed] While Sweet Kisses was kept in the top 60 for several weeks, the label decided to make one last attempt to launch the third single from the album.[citation needed] "I Think I'm in Love with You" was released in May 2000, peaking at No. 25 in August 2000.[31] In total, the album stayed on the chart for 62 weeks.[31] The album was certified 2× Platinum by the RIAA.[32] The album has sold about 1.9 million copies in the US, and over 4 million copies worldwide.[33]
In 2000, Simpson started recording the follow-up to Sweet Kisses, with what Columbia considered more radio-friendly, up-tempo tracks. The commercial performance of her debut album led Simpson to reevaluate her career and although she was enjoying some success, she felt she could improve on this. Feeling her more "innocent" image would halt her career from developing further, Simpson adopted a sexier image and newer sound, at the suggestion of the Columbia executives[34] She moved into the teen-pop genre, as she felt that restyling herself to match the image of Spears and Aguilera would help remake her career.[34] She separated from her then-boyfriend Nick Lachey, in March 2001, feeling the need to concentrate on her career. Her new image was promoted through appearances on many events, where Simpson wore revealing outfits.[34] The development of this image coincided with the production and release of her second studio effort, Irresistible.[34] Simpson said that she wanted to portray a "sexier, more mature style".[34] "I recorded [Sweet Kisses] when I was 17 years old and I'm 21 [this month] so there is four years of growth involved," Simpson said in an interview with Coventry Newspapers in July 2001.[35] In an interview with Cosmopolitan in June 2001, she explained, "This record is about who I am now. The music is edgier, and I'm all grown up."[34] According to Terri Doughtery, author of People in the News: Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, Simpson hoped her new image would bring more attention to the power of her voice.[34] "It's not just me singing about being in love. I also have heartbreak songs and girls telling off guys songs. It's going to take me a while to recoup [on] this album, because we spent a lot of money on it," Simpson said to Entertainment Weekly.[36]
The lead single from the album, "Irresistible", was released on April 12, 2001, as a CD single.[37] The song received generally negative reviews from music critics. They criticized the sexuality of its lyrics[38] and the over-usage of digital sound manipulators,[39] with Associated Press calling it "unimaginative". In 2003, the song won a Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) "Pop Music Award".[40][41] "Irresistible" became a moderate commercial success, peaking within the top twenty hit in the United States and in eleven countries.[42][43] The song was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).[44] The accompanying music video was directed by Simon Brand, and features Simpson dressed as a spy, trying to compromise some evidence in a laboratory.[45] Record producer Jermaine Dupri of So So Def Recordings remixed the song within a Hip-Hop—tinged genre style which featured rap artist Lil Bow Wow.[46] Released on May 25, 2001 Irresistible debuted at number 6 in June 2001 on the Billboard 200 chart,[47] with 127,000[48] copies sold in its first week. It was later certified Gold[49] by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling or shipments of 500,000 copies or more. At the date, the album has sold 3 million copies worldwide. She toured with Destiny's Child, Nelly, and Eve on MTV's first Total Request Live (TRL) Tour, which spanned thirty dates in the US.[50][51] Simpson later embarked on her first headlining tour, The DreamChaser Tour. The tour began in August, but due to the September 11, 2001 attacks could not complete the planned dates.[52]
Following the announcement of her wedding to Nick Lachey, it was confirmed they would star in the reality show Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica, which began airing on MTV. The show was originally intended for Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley, but the couple decided not to continue with the project after the start of pre-production. It was shelved until 2002, when Jessica's father and manager, Joe Simpson, contacted MTV about producing a show starring his daughter and her new husband. Newlyweds quickly became a pop culture phenomenon and is credited with making her a household name. "I never knew that just doing the show would give me that pedestal to step on," Simpson told Blender magazine.[53]
On February 1, 2004, Simpson performed during the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. On July 22, Simpson released the lead single from her upcoming third studio album. The single, "Sweetest Sin", dealt with the topic of Simpson losing her virginity to then husband Nick Lachey. The recording process of "Sweetest Sin" was documented in an episode of Simpson's reality series, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica.[54] Simpson originally recorded "Sweetest Sin" confidentially in a slightly remixed form and announced she was pleased with its progress. However, her superiors at Columbia Records told her that she had made the song too "challenging"; in essence, they felt that potential listeners of the song would be alienated by singing they would not be able to duplicate. Simpson was filmed breaking into tears when she received the news. Later, she re-recorded her vocals with the assistance of Nick Lachey, whom she brought along because she felt he was a good vocal producer.[55] On August 9, 2003, the song debuted at number forty on Billboard Pop Songs, reaching number thirty-seven two weeks later.[56] "Sweetest Sin" failed to make into the Hot 100 chart, peaking at number twenty-four on Bubbling Under Hot 100.[57]
Simpson's third studio album, In This Skin, was released on August 19, 2003 to coincide with the series premiere of Newlyweds. In This Skin, debuted at number ten on the Billboard 200, with sales of 64,000 in its first week. The album quickly declined down the charts, failing to match the success of Simpson's previous efforts. By January 2004, the album had sold just 565,000 copies.[58] "With You" was released as the album's second single, largely in hopes that the song would revive In This Skin on the charts. In the United States, the song debuted at number sixty-five on the Billboard Hot 100, on the issue dated December 27, 2003.[59] In March 20, 2004, the single reached its peak position of number fourteen and stayed on the chart for twenty-three weeks. "With You" became Simpson's fourth top-forty single in the US and her second highest peak on the chart since "I Wanna Love You Forever" (1999).[31] The song also peaked at number one on Billboard Pop Songs chart and was her first number one on the chart.[31] Due to the strong sales, the single was certified Gold by RIAA for selling 500,000 copies.[60] In 2004, Columbia Records decided to re-release In This Skin with several new tracks in order to utilize the success of the singer. With "With You" on the top of the radio charts in February 2004, Simpson released her third single, "Take My Breath Away", as the first single from the new re-release. The re-release worked as In This Skin jumped to number two on the Billboard charts, selling over 157,000[61] copies that week. The album stayed in the top ten for eight non-consecutive weeks and stayed in the Top 100 for sixty-one weeks. The album spent a total of 75 weeks on the Billboard 200.[62] In December 2004, In This Skin was certified 3x Multi Platinum by the RIAA for sales more than 3 million copies only in U.S.[63][64] The album ranked the No. 14 in Billboard Year End Charts Albums 2004.[65] According to Simpson's biography, the album has sold 4 million copies in US, to date.[66]
Simpson and Lachey starred in the television special The Nick and Jessica Variety Hour which aired in 2004 and was compared to The Sonny & Cher Show.[67] In late 2004, Simpson released her first Christmas album, Rejoyce: The Christmas Album. It includes a duet with her sister, Ashlee Simpson, on the song "Little Drummer Boy". Additionally, it also includes a duet with Nick Lachey, Simpson's husband at the time, on "Baby, It's Cold Outside". The cover of Amy Grant's "Breath of Heaven (Mary's Song)" is notable, as Simpson has said that Grant is one of her favorite recording artists and her role model.[68] Rejoyce was certified gold by the RIAA in January 2005.[69] Its singles are "Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow" and "What Christmas Means To Me" (although no accompanying video was produced); the song "O Holy Night has a video. In 2005, Newlyweds won a People's Choice Award for Favorite Reality Show before wrapping shortly after.[70]
In the summer of 2005, Simpson sang the national anthem at the Indy 500 before making her first appearance in a motion picture as Daisy Duke in the movie version of the television series The Dukes of Hazzard.[71] The film was No. 1 at the box office its opening weekend, and grossed $30.7 million on 3,785 screens. It also had an adjusted-dollar rank of No. 14 all-time for August releases. The film eventually collected $110.5 million worldwide, although it was much less financially successful outside the U.S.[72] Simpson appeared on The Dukes of Hazzard soundtrack, releasing "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'", a cover of the 1966 Nancy Sinatra. The song peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100 and won a People's Choice Award for Favorite Song from a Movie, in 2006.[73][74] The song's video featured Simpson as Daisy Duke. It contains scenes of her flirting and singing in a bar and then later washing the General Lee car, wearing a skin-tight, revealing pink bikini. In some countries the video was banned for its overtly sexual content. Simpson received criticism from a Christian group calling itself "The Resistance", for the sexualized image she used in the music video for "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'".[75] In response, Simpson stated, "It didn't really surprise me because I grew up with a lot of that backlash. That's why I didn't end up going into the Christian music industry. I think that if they're really good Christians the judgment wouldn't be there."[76]
In 2005, MTV reported that Simpson had begun working on her fifth studio album.[77] It was also reported that Simpson had parted ways with Columbia, and would release future albums through Epic Records. The album's lead single, "A Public Affair", was released on June 29, 2006, the day before her divorce from Nick Lachey was finalized. The Yahoo! Music download of the song gained media attention because it was made available in MP3 format, without Digital Rights Management, which is normally used to restrict copying of commercially released singles. However, the price to download the song was US$1.99, higher than the $0.99 norm for most DRM-restricted tracks. The increased price was rationalized not by the DRM-free format, but by offering users the ability to "personalize" the song with a specific name.[78] The single was released in United States, Canada and Australia in 2006. Later the song was released in Europe in February 2007. The single debuted at number thirty-nine on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart,[79] Simpson's second highest debut after "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'". It had previously debuted at number twenty on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, which represents the twenty-five singles below the Hot 100's number 100 position that have not yet appeared on the Hot 100. Digital download sales were moderate until the release of the single's music video. In late July, "A Public Affair" joined her sister Ashlee's song "Invisible" in the top ten on the U.S. iTunes Store's list of most popular songs, the first time in iTunes history that two siblings had different songs in the top ten. The song peaked in its fifth week on the Hot 100. In October 2006 the song peaked at number 1 on Hot Dance Club Play. "A Public Affair" was certified Gold in US for obtaining more than 500,000 downloads.
On August 29, 2006, Simpson released her fifth studio album A Public Affair under Epic Records. The album debuted at number 5 on the Billboard 200,[31] selling over 101,000 copies in its first week, the highest first week sales of Simpson's albums. A Public Affair shipped 500,000 units in the US and was certified Gold by the RIAA. In Canada the album debuted at number 6, marking Simpson's highest position on the albums chart in Canada and was later certified Gold for 50,000 copies sold. A Public Affair also made the Top 40 in Japan, Ireland and Australia, in the latter country peaking lower than In This Skin which reached number 13 and was certified Platinum. Despite the title track becoming an international hit, the album has sold just 1 million copies to date, and is considered by and large a commercial failure compared to Simpson's previous work.
Simpson's second film, Employee of the Month, was released October 6, 2006. With poor reviews, the film took in $11.8 million in its opening weekend, debuting at number 4 just behind Open Season.[80] In December 2006, while performing a tribute to Dolly Parton at the Kennedy Center Awards, she botched the lyrics, getting flustered in front of a crowd that included prominent persons such as Steven Spielberg, Shania Twain, and President Bush. Though Simpson was given the chance to redo the song for cameras, her portion was edited out of the CBS broadcast.[81][82] In December 2007, Simpson co-starred with Luke Wilson in her third film, Blonde Ambition. The film opened in eight theaters in Texas (the home state of both Simpson and Wilson), and earned US $6,422. It was released on DVD in January 2008.[83] Blonde Ambition fared better overseas, where it grossed $253,008 in Ukraine its opening weekend.[84]
In September 2007, Simpson's father, and manager, Joe Simpson stated to People magazine that Simpson was considering doing a country album. Joe Simpson told People that she is "talking about doing a country record and going back to her roots, being from Texas."[85] "Come On Over", first leaked onto the internet on May 27, 2008. Shortly after, country radio stations around the country began giving the single radio play. In the United States, "Come on Over" became the most-added song to country radio for the week of June 6, 2008, debuting at number forty-one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. It broke a record held by Miranda Lambert ("Me and Charlie Talking") and Brad Cotter ("I Meant To") for highest-debuting first chart entry by a solo artist; both artists debuted at number forty-two on that same chart.[86] The video for the first single, "Come On Over", premiered on Simpson's official website in July 2008.[87] The single peaked at number eighteen on the Billboard Hot Country Songs. Prior to the album release, Simpson performed at select state fairs and visited various country music radio stations in order to promote the album. On July 19, 2008, Simpson performed at the Country Thunder Festival in Wisconsin. She was booed by the crowd and received a poor reception from country music critics.[88] She responded by saying, "I don't know what your perception is of Jessica Simpson or what tabloid you buy, but I just want you to know that I'm just a girl from Texas; I’m just like you. I'm doing what I love and dating a boy."[89]
The country album, titled Do You Know, was released on September 9, 2008.[90] Despite selling only 65,000 copies in its first week, Do You Know debuted at number four on the Billboard 200, but fell rapidly, dropping out of that list in only nine weeks.[91] At the same time, it dropped rapidly out of the top twenty on the Country Albums Chart, where it had held the top spot for only one week. Overall, the album has dramatically underperformed compared to the sales of Simpson's previous album, which was also widely regarded as a commercial failure. As of early 2009, it has sold 173,000 copies in the United States.[92] Sales in Australia and the UK were far more poor, with the album barely managing to enter the top 100 in Australia, at number 95. In 2009, it was announced that Simpson would be supporting the Rascal Flatts on tour that January[93] during the final leg of their "Bob That Head Tour". The tour kicked off on January 17, 2009 in Kansas City, Missouri running over 20 shows ending on March 14, 2009 in Irvine, California. Simpson's next movie, Major Movie Star (later renamed Private Valentine: Blonde and Dangerous) was released to DVD on February 3, 2009.[94]
Simpson's VH1 documentary series, The Price of Beauty, began airing in March 2010. The series followed Simpson around the world, introducing viewers to the different perceptions of beauty in different cultures.[95][96][97] The premiere episode attracted one million viewers,[98][99] but Simpson revealed that the series would return in 2011 with a format change.[100] Initially, Simpson planned to release a new studio album that would end her contract with her label, Epic Records.[101] However, a greatest hits compilation, Playlist: The Very Best of Jessica Simpson, was released in late October instead.[102] Simpson's second holiday album Happy Christmas was released under eleveneleven and Primary Wave in November 2010.[103][104][105] In June 2011, it was announced that Simpson participated as a mentor in NBC's reality show Fashion Star with Elle Macpherson.[106] In July 2011, she appeared on Fashion Star alongside Nicole Richie.[107]
During her first pregnancy in 2012, Simpson signed a multimillion dollar endorsement deal with Weight Watchers, in which she agreed to use the Weight Watchers diet plan after giving birth to lose the approximately 70 pounds she gained during her pregnancy.[108][109] Her first TV commercial for the company began airing in September 2012.[110][111] In December, Simpson confirmed reports that she was pregnant again and[112][113] Weight Watchers announced that she would discontinue following the company's diet plan during her pregnancy.[114] On March 8, 2013, the second and final season of Fashion Star premiered on NBC and ended on May 10, 2013.[115][116]
During the recording of her debut album Sweet Kisses, Simpson became involved with Nick Lachey.[117] Despite the pair splitting up when Jessica began recording Irresistible, she later began dating Nick Lachey once again. They married on October 26, 2002.[118] She famously announced she had remained a virgin until her marriage.[119] In November 2005, Simpson and Lachey announced they were separating.[120] Simpson filed for divorce on December 16, 2005, citing "irreconcilable differences."[citation needed] Their divorce was finalized on June 30, 2006.[121]
In November 2007, Simpson began dating Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. The relationship was controversial among some Dallas Cowboys fans, and she was blamed for Romo's poor performances. Some of the Cowboys' fans gave her the nickname "Yoko Romo" in reference to Yoko Ono, who many Beatles fans blamed for "ruining" John Lennon.[122] Even then-President George W. Bush jokingly endorsed the "Jessica jinx" after the Giants went on to win the Super Bowl in 2008. During the traditional White House reception for the winning team, President Bush was quoted as saying: "We're going to send Jessica Simpson to the Democrat National Convention".[123]
In November 2010, Simpson became engaged to Eric Johnson, a retired NFL tight end, whom she had been dating since May.[125] The couple have two children: daughter Maxwell Drew Johnson (born May 1, 2012)[126][127][128] and son Ace Knute Johnson (born June 30, 2013).[129] The couple is due to marry in 2014.[130]

A parallel line named Dessert Treats was launched the following year in February 2005. The new line was marketed at a much younger audience.[131] Simpson and stylist Ken Pavés launched a line of hair and beauty products on the Home Shopping Network.[132] Simpson also created the Jessica Simpson Collection (JSC) in which she designs and markets a line of handbags and (primarily high-heeled) shoes and boots.[133] JSC was projected to become the first celebrity brand to break $1 billion in annual sales,[134] and would launch an e-commerce beauty site with celebrity aesthetician Nerida Joy, BeautyMint, on October 31, 2011.[135] The Jessica Simpson's Intimates began selling in major department stores and online shopping sites in spring 2009.[136] Simpson has launched a fragrance line. Her fragrance was made by Parlux Fragrances. Her debut perfume, Fancy, was launched in 2008. The success of Fancy spawned three more fragrances, Fancy Love, Fancy Nights and I Fancy You.[137] As of February 2014[update], the brand is worth USD$1 billion.[138]
Simpson has made commercials for Pizza Hut, Proactiv Solution and a commercial for Ice Breakers with her sister Ashlee Simpson. In 2005, she started advertising Proactiv Solution, an over-the-counter acne medicine. In 2006, she premiered in another Pizza Hut commercial for the Super Bowl XL broadcast. She sang "These Bites Are Made For Poppin'," in reference to the song "These Boots Are Made For Walkin'," to advertise the new Cheesy Bites Pizza.[139] In 2007, the Super Bowl featured her third Pizza Hut commercial, which again promoted the Cheesy Bites Pizza.[140] She has also advertised DirecTV in character as Daisy Duke.[141]
Simpson is Operation Smile's International Youth Ambassador.[142][143] In March 2007, Simpson donated a new Chrysler minivan to the Elim orphanage in Nuevo Laredo. Simpson won a Chrysler Crossfire sports car at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, but exchanged the $50,000 luxury car for a minivan so she could help the orphanage.[144]
Jessica Simpson is a Republican.[145] Simpson endorsed George W. Bush for president in 2004,[146] but was later said to have "snubbed" him by canceling an appearance at a 2006 Republican fundraiser in Washington, D.C. The singer's father, Joe Simpson, explained that he and Jessica are "big supporters" of the president, who invited them. But they felt it was inappropriate to attend a political fundraiser.[147]
Simpson has listed Mariah Carey, Aretha Franklin, Sade, and Whitney Houston as influences on her music.[148] She has also stated that Faith Hill, Shania Twain and Martina McBride helped influence her for her debut country album, Do You Know.[149]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Jessica Ann Simpson was born July 10, 1980 in Abilene, Texas to Joe and Tina Simpson. She grew up in Richardson, Texas, living a normal childhood as the daughter of a youth minister. In church, she was able to shine, using her gifted voice to attract an independent record producer. This producer was the first of many to see the potential for greatness in Jessica. However, because of the lack of finances the independent label went bankrupt, preventing Jessica's album from reaching wider audiences.Although heartbroken, Jessica's dream to be on the radio remained. With support from her family, and her father's managerial talents, Jessica's independent album managed to work its way to Tommy Mottola's desk, then President of Columbia Records. He was won over by her "pure heart" and strong voice. Jessica's singing career with Columbia would take her all over the world many times over and include three major albums reaching Gold, Platinum, and double Platinum.As a born performer, it was only natural for Jessica to spend more time in front of the camera both in television and feature films. Audiences were naturally drawn to her open and uncensored attitude, contributing to the success of the reality television series Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica (2003), which she starred in alongside her then husband Nick Lachey. She followed up the show by making the bold choice to fill in the famous "Daisy Duke shorts" alongside Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott in her debut performance for the film version of The Dukes of Hazzard (2005).
      Auditioned for MMC (1989) as a child, but lost the part to future stars like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera (who was later her competition in the music industry).
      Attended J.J. Pearce High School in Richardson, Texas (1995-1998), where she was very active in theater arts. She dropped out as a junior to further pursue her singing career.
      Attended Richardson North Junior High in Richardson, Texas, where she was a cheerleader and a part of the co-ed choir. She never graduated, but dropped out and earned a GED.
      Elder sister of Ashlee Simpson. Their parents are Joe Simpson and Tina Simpson. Joe worked as a psychologist and a Baptist minister in Texas but now manages his daughters' musical careers and their official websites. Mom, Tina, helps run her clothing empire.
      Hosted Saturday Night Live (1975) on 17 January 2004 with her husband, Nick Lachey. She parodied Britney Spears and Paris Hilton.
      She and her ex-husband Nick Lachey lived in Calabasas, California, which was also the location of their show Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica (2003).
      Beat out Britney Spears, for the role of Daisy Duke, in the upcoming movie, The Dukes of Hazzard (2005).
      She played a dumb blonde on her television series, but according to her mother (in the August issue of Vanity Fair) her I.Q. was in the 160s in fifth grade, which would have placed her in the "genius" category at the time. Whether or not her I.Q. has remained consistent is unknown.
      Her all-time favorite song is Berlin's "Take My Breath Away". She sang a re-recording of the song.
      Has a song by Adam Green named "Jessica" dedicated to her, including the lyrics "Jessica Simpson, where has your love gone? It's not in your music, no. So where has it gone then?"

      Had a dog named Daisy (a malti-poo), which was a gift to Jessica from Nick Lachey, until Daisy was snatched and killed by a coyote in September of 2009.
      Made the tabloid headlines after attending a bachelorette party for friend Jennifer MacFarlane, where the entertainment was provided by two members of the "Genital Origami" troupe Puppetry of the Penis. She reportedly "howled and giggled" at the duo's routine, which included such installations as "The Fruit Bat" and "The Turtle." (November 2004)
      She is famous for keeping her virginity until her wedding night. She was questioned by an interviewer about it and when she addressed it openly, she was shocked that it was made into such a big deal by the media. She quickly became a positive role model for teenage girls and young women.

      Recently discovered that she is allergic to cheese, wheat, coffee, chocolate, tomatoes, corn and hot peppers.
      In 2007 when she was the girlfriend of Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, she appeared up in the Cowboys' stadium luxury box during a December game against the Eagles. She was wearing a pink Cowboys jersey with Romo's number. Unfortunately, this did not help Romo as he had his worst game of the season, throwing three interceptions in a 10-6 loss.

      She and Nick have a variety show on ABC called The Nick & Jessica Variety Hour (2004). [April 2004]
      [about losing a spot on MMC (1989) to Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera] I wanted to give up, but my family kept me going.
      [about how successful her future album may be] I'm right there ready to explode . . . or I could go pfffffft. No one could ever hear from me again.
      [in "CosmoGIRL", 2/01] I have this fear of talking to people. I'm worried they won't like me. I've always had that insecurity. I tried to go up to Céline Dion at the Billboard Awards last year [2000]. She was right there, but I couldn't do it.
      After 9-11, I knew that I never ever wanted to be away from Nick [husband Nick Lachey] ever for the rest of my life.
      Faith has helped me to be a strong person and stay level headed. It brings me peace. In this business you definitely need peace.
      I want to be a diva... like people-totally-respect-my-music diva, not diva like carry-my-diet-Coke-around.
      Natural beauty is really happiness with who you are. It you like who you are on the inside, that'll come through on the outside.
      Everybody from my record label to my father as my manager was like, "Don't get married". But when I got married my career began.
      [on Operation Smile] Nick [husband Nick Lachey] and I have gotten a lot of attention for doing a "reality" show on television, but the ability to give a child his or her smile back is the kind of reality that really deserves the attention. We are both so happy to play a small part in the wonderful work Operation Smile does for children.
      I think that freshness and that innocence is something that is missing from a lot of female singers. I'm certainly not denying that I'm young, but I'm not fluff.
      I'm such a sucker for sappy songs. I'm a big romantic, and I love love. I love singing about it and listening to songs about it
      My mom was really worried I'd grow up looking strange, so every night before I went to bed, she'd pull my legs and stretch them so they'd be in proportion with the rest of my body.
      I don't really care what I'm famous for. As long as I get to do the movie roles I want to do and still make records.
      I don't want people walking out of a movie thinking I was trying to act or be some movie star. I want them to think, "That might make me like Jessica a little bit more."
      [introducing herself to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton in December 2004] You've done a nice job decorating the White House.
      My first kiss was when I was 14. I could tell it was coming because Jason picked up a handful of mints. We had been going out for over a year, so it was really special.
      [on plastic surgery] I'm not against plastic surgery. I do believe that it becomes an addiction to people. But if you're doing it for yourself, then you're doing it for yourself. If you're doing it to make heads turn when you walk down the street and get noticed, then I think that's a bunch of BS.
      Why go through your life with regrets? Every decision you make determines who you are. If you make a bad one, you fix it. It makes you stronger.
      [on the "perils" of being a curvaceous Christian pop star] I had doors slammed in my face as a 14-year-old because my boobs were too big.
      I love to hug - fans, friends and family alike - so it hurts when the security guards tell me I can't do it at record stores during autograph parties...which they often do.
      My bra and underwear always have to match. I love that. I've collected a whole lot of sets. When a girl has on color-coordinated underpants, she just feels sexy. And I've been a cheerleader, so I should know!
      My #1 beauty tip is as follows: look someone in the eye when greeting them, smile, and follow up with a hug. I got that from my mom...and it's never failed me yet!
      When I was born, my dad wanted to christen me "Misty Dawn Simpson." But my mom talked him out of it - "Jessica Ann" was her idea, and it stuck - so you tell ME what it's like having a twin sister with that name.
      I will never do nudity. I don't care how dark and intellectual the role could be, you know. I don't care if I frickin' could get an Oscar for it, I'm not going to do it.
      [When asked when she feels the most beautiful]: I feel most beautiful when I am in my bathtub, listening to Sade. I also feel beautiful when I laugh and when I'm with my friends and I just have a T-shirt and booty shorts on.

Carolinagirl7314: You have EVERYTHING? Sounds like you have about as much sense as Jessica does. Want some chicken from the sea? Jessica might be attractive, however, she has nothing at all above that. Her movies flop, her concerts dont draw money, she is nothing but a pretty face and tits. Hollywood already has tons of those, and most of them can count to 5. Jessica go work on the farm and get out of Hollywood.
i think jessica simpson is the hottest person alive and im goin 2 c that movie and i dont care wut other ppl think of her ..... and ..did i mention she was hot
I'm a huge fan of both Jessica and Nick.  I have all the Newlyweds DVDs, and I see how much they both loved each other.  I'm having a hard time excepting that she's going for a divorce.  Has there been any marriage counsling?  Marriage is so important, and it's a full-time job.  I know that I don't know the true details, but it does seem that they're not trying to work at the problems.
I loved Nick and Jess on Newleyweds but even watching the show seemed all FAKE to me. I mean it was a reality show but cameras were around. Imagine how they were when cameras weren't around? So we just all assume "Oh, they seemed happy on the show" But again what do we know when cams weren't around? Noone files for a divorce like its fun & games. Its serious business. Obviously, she wasn't happy enough to even try marriage counseling and work it out. It sux this had to happen because they were like soul-mates but everything happens for a reason and again, we the fans only see whats going on in their lives when cameras are around..DONT FORGET THAT!
I think that they both are at fault. Yes, Nick may have cheated but Jessica should have taken care of her man like she was supposed to and maybe he wouldn't have went anywhere else. She never really ever seemed that into him on their reality TV show. C'mon really a girl from Texas that can't cook????? Go figure!!!!!! Nick deserves someone who is going to take care of him, like a REAL lady. She blew it big time.
I am a big Jessica Simpson fan and I honestly don't see anything wrong with a female wanting to look sexy, even if they are a christian. She is very beautiful and talented and if she wants to show it, that does'nt make her a "non-christian".  All women want to look beautiful.  And I own some of her dessert merchandise and I think it's awesome!  If people want to turn it into something sexual, that's their problem, not Jessica's.  There is forbidden fruit everywhere, and if teens are going to use Dessert beauty to indulge in sexual activities, then they were bound to have sex anyway. JESSICA SIMPSON RULES!!!!!!!!!!!
f**k off .. all of you... every star in hollywood does at least  ONE   video like jessica simpson and that's ok with you all but if jessica simpson does it,it's not right you are such airheads..I don't understand how you n be alive with such stupid brains!!

I think the rude comments about Jessica are horrible! I'm Nick's age & I have everything they have ever made together (video's, cd's & all the Newleyweds DVD's). I hate that their marriage didn't work out. Jessica IS  a Christian. Get off of her people! I love how she is! I pray that her & Nick will get back together. He shouldn't have cheated even if it just was a kiss. I'm pulling for Jessica Simpson Lachey ALL the way! Go Jessica!

Disproving the idea that a basic grasp of general knowledge, in fact, any kind of knowledge, is a prerequisite to becoming a world celebrity, Jessica Simpson was the US intellectual equivalent of Jade Goody. But what she lacked in brain-power, the ‘Newlyweds’ star made up with her sheer persistence to be a pop star.
Jessica learnt to sing in the local Baptist church choir and her Christian/Country roots would form a continual thread throughout her career. She hoped to launch her professional career by joining 'The Mickey Mouse Club' (the launch pad for her more successful rivals, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera), but the 12-year-old was rejected. Disappointed but undaunted, Simpson continued to sing in the Christian music circuit after being discovered by a small music label while performing at church camp.
With her father as her manager and her mother as her stylist, Simpson eventually signed with Sony and toured with popular boy bands during the late 1990s. She released her first album, 'Sweet Kisses', in 1999 and her second, 'Irresistible', including the hit single 'I Wanna Love You Forever', in 2001. Success for Simpson remained just out of reach, however. Her albums received a somewhat lukewarm response and were eclipsed by the enormous success of pop contemporaries Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
It wasn't until after she married 98° crooner Nick Lachey and starred in MTV's reality show 'Newlyweds' that Simpson's career took off. The show followed the couple around for their first year of marriage (and then their second), providing the insatiable audience with a peek at their glamorous and mundane world. Boosted by the success of the show, Simpson's third album, 'In This Skin', was re-released in 2004, becoming a huge hit among MTV viewers. That year, the couple also produced 'The Nick and Jessica Variety Hour' on ABC and enjoyed a successful turn as hosts of 'Saturday Night Live'.
Simpson soon turned to acting with a leading role in 'Dukes of Hazzard' (2005), the big screen remake of the popular television series. By the end of that same year, Simpson and Lachey filed for divorce. Her career also seemed to flounder, appearing opposite comedian Dane Cook in the lacklustre comedy 'Employee of the Month' (2006) and receiving little notice for her next album 'A Public Affair' (2006).
Returning to her love of country music, Simpson recorded 'Do You Know' (2008). The album made it into the top five of Billboard's album charts. She co-wrote many of the songs for the album, which featured a duet with Dolly Parton on the title track. Simpson is now working on a new reality show entitled 'The Price of Beauty', which will explore beauty treatments, fashions, and fads.
Her last relationship with American footballer Tony Romo ended after his career suffered and even President Bush blamed Simpson, calling the decline in his fortunes, the "Jessica Jinx".In 2010, Jessica released a greatest hits album 'Playlist: The Very Best of Jessica Simpson', along with a Christmas album which was released in November of that year.While Simpson may not have been as successful as the likes of Britney and Christina in her music career, the star has developed a hugely popular clothing empire.
In fact, the Jessica Simpson Collection is on track to become the first celebrity fashion line to generate more than a billion dollars in annual sales. Simpson's mother is the company's co-creative director.
She has also found love again and is set to marry former NFL player Eric Johnson. Simpson told Women's Wear Daily in 2011 that the pair may opt for a low-key ceremony when they tie the knot as they have both been married before.
In 2011, the star said she has spoken to the makers of the US X Factor about being a judge on the show. The singer and fashion designer said it "would be a lot of fun" and suggested that mentoring up-and-coming singers is something she might like to do.However, this job was given to Nicole Scherzinger of Pussycat Dolls fame. Jessica did work as a mentor on NBC's new reality show 'Fashion Star' with Elle McPherson. The singer appeared on the show in July 2011 alongside Christina Aguilera.
Simpson made an official announcement that she is pregnant with her first child on her official website at Halloween.
She dressed up as a mummy Halloween costume and cradled her baby bump. She joked that she is going to be a mummy herself after months of speculation surrounding the star. In November 2011, she was thought to be six months gone.
The singer also postponed her wedding to Johnson, which was set to take place in November 2011 as she wants to wait until after the birth of their child.
Simpson explained that the couple will still get married but she doesn't want the stress of a wedding when she is pregnant.
A source told People magazine: "They're both still really committed to getting married, and were both really into making decisions about what kind of wedding they wanted."

In the late Nineties, blonde beauty Jessica Simpson lined up behind multiplatinum teen queens Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears to cash in on the era's teen-pop phenomenon. But while Simpson achieved Top 10 success with the single "I Wanna Love You Forever" (Number Three, 1999), her star was on the wane by the turn of the millennium. In 2003, things took a dramatic turn when she and then-husband Nick Lachey of the boy band 98 Degrees, landed an MTV reality show, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica. The marriage didn't last, but the show became a pop culture phenomenon, making Simpson a household name. As the 2000s unfolded, Simpson appeared in movies, TV specials, commercials and launched her own designer clothing line.
She was born Jessica Ann Simpson on July 10th, 1980 in Dallas, Texas, to Joe and Tina Simpson. Her father, a youth minister, raised her and younger sister Ashlee in the Baptist faith. Jessica sang in her church choir and eventually auditioned for a role in the same Mickey Mouse Club revival show that launched the careers of Spears, Aguilera and Justin Timberlake. Simpson didn't make the MMC, but she eventually attracted the attention of a small Contemporary Christian Music label and began recording her Christian-pop debut, Jessica. The label folded before the album came out, but her grandmother bankrolled an independent pressing. Simpson attained some success on the Christian-music circuit, performing shows with CCM stars such as Kirk Franklin. At 17, she moved over to the secular market, signing with Columbia Records and releasing her major-label debut, Sweet Kisses (Number 25), in 1999.
Columbia positioned Simpson as a wholesome version of Spears and Aguilera. She advocated sexual abstinence, and her first single, "I Wanna Love You Forever," was more of an adult contemporary ballad than the kind of dance-pop her two teen-queen rivals made. Simpson toured with 98 Degrees and appeared as Lachey's girlfriend in the video for the group's hit song "My Everything." The couple soon struck up a real-life relationship. When Kisses stalled on the charts, Columbia released a second single, the dance-pop song "I Think I'm in Love with You," which looped the beat and guitar part from John Mellencamp's 1982 hit "Jack and Diane." The single reached Number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2001, she released her second album, Irresistible, which got a big push from MTV, reaching Number Six on the Billboard 200.
She and Lachey were married on October 26th, 2002, and Simpson appeared on some episodes of That '70s Show as she began to branch out into acting. In 2003, she released her third album, In This Skin, which charted moderately well and spawned the single "Sweetest Sin." But she never attained the success of her two rivals, Spears and Aguilera.
That same year, Simpson and Lachey's reality show Newlyweds began airing on MTV, and by the following year the pair were a staple of celebrity weeklies and gossip columns, with Simpson playing the role of the bumbling wife. Simpson's father, Joe, had taken the idea of airing his daughter's private life to MTV, and was constantly present throughout its making. His management decisions — putting his daughter's life on public display — became the topic of much debate in the media and among record executives. But one thing was clear: Newlyweds was a resounding success. And when Columbia rereleased In This Skin in 2003, the album shot to Number Two and its single, "With You," reached Number One on the Top 40 Mainstream pop chart and Number 14 on the Hot 100. A second single, Simpson's cover of Berlin's 1986 Number One hit "Take My Breath Away," reached Number 20. With a more mature sound, Simpson had pulled herself out of the teen-pop ghetto once and for all, but her gaffes on Newlyweds earned her a reputation for being a "dumb blonde." Throughout the show's run, from 2003 to 2005, viewers and critics debated whether Simpson was acting or playing herself.
In April 2004, Simpson appeared with her husband in the ABC television special The Nick and Jessica Variety Hour, a throwback to the variety TV of the Seventies such as The Sonny & Cher Show. In December, Simpson released the holiday collection ReJoyce: The Christmas Album (Number 14, 2004). The following year, she appeared as Daisy Duke in a movie remake of Seventies TV show The Dukes of Hazzard. The movie topped box office sales the weekend of its release, grossing more than $30 million. For the soundtrack, Simpson remade Nancy Sinatra's Number One single of 1966, "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'" (Number 14, 2005), and appeared as Daisy Duke in the video. Her next film role came in the 2006 comedy Employee of the Month. The following year, she was in the Luke Wilson comedy Blonde Ambition, which grossed only $1,332 its opening weekend and went swiftly to DVD.
In 2006, after much tabloid speculation, Simpson and Lachey divorced. Simpson moved from Columbia Records to Epic Records and released the poppy A Public Affair (Number Five, 2006), which deliberately alludes to the media storm surrounding her marriage to Lachey. The album sold more than 100,000 copies its first week, and the title track became a Top 20 hit single, but the record floundered after that. In 2007, word spread that Simpson was relocating to Nashville to explore making a country album. In June 2008 her first country single, "Come on Over," received mostly positive reviews and debuted at Number 41 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart, making it the best debut by an artist with no prior history on the chart.
Since her split with Lachey, Simpson has been linked with new men ranging from the blues-pop singer John Mayer to Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. Debate over whether her father is overly involved in her personal and professional life has continued to follow the singer.
