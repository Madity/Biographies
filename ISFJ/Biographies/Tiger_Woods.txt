Eldrick Tont "Tiger" Woods (born December 30, 1975)[4][5] is an American professional golfer who is among the most successful golfers of all time. Formerly World No. 1, he has been one of the highest-paid athletes in the world for several years.
Woods turned professional in 1996, and by April 1997 he had already won his first major, the 1997 Masters in a record-breaking performance, winning the tournament by 12 strokes and pocketing $486,000. He first reached the number one position in the world rankings in June 1997. Through the 2000s, Woods was the dominant force in golf, spending 264 weeks from August 1999 to September 2004 and 281 weeks from June 2005 to October 2010 as world number one. From December 2009 to early April 2010, Woods took leave from professional golf to focus on his marriage after he admitted infidelity. His many extra-marital indescretions were revealed by several different women, through many worldwide media sources.[6] This was followed by a loss of golf form, and his ranking gradually fell to a low of No. 58 in November 2011.[7][8] He ended a career-long winless streak of 107 weeks when he captured the Chevron World Challenge in December 2011.[8] After winning the Arnold Palmer Invitational on March 25, 2013, he ascended to the No.1 ranking once again, holding the top spot until May 2014.
Woods has broken numerous golf records. He has been world number one for the most consecutive weeks and for the greatest total number of weeks of any other golfer. He has been awarded PGA Player of the Year a record eleven times,[9] the Byron Nelson Award for lowest adjusted scoring average a record eight times, and has the record of leading the money list in ten different seasons. He has won 14 professional major golf championships, the second highest of any player (Jack Nicklaus leads with 18), and 79 PGA Tour events, second all time behind Sam Snead, who had 82 wins.[10] He has more career major wins and career PGA Tour wins than any other active golfer. He is the youngest player to achieve the career Grand Slam, and the youngest and fastest to win 50 tournaments on tour. Additionally, Woods is only the second golfer, after Jack Nicklaus, to have achieved a career Grand Slam three times. Woods has won 18 World Golf Championships, and won at least one of those events in each of the first 11 years after they began in 1999. Woods is the only golfer to win both The Silver Medal and The Gold Medal at The Open Championship.
Woods was born in Cypress, California, to Earl (1932–2006) and Kultida (Tida) Woods (born 1944). He is the only child of their marriage; however, he does have two half-brothers, Earl Jr. (born 1955) and Kevin (born 1957), and a half-sister, Royce (born 1958) from the 18-year marriage of Earl Woods and his first wife, Barbara Woods Gray.[11] Earl, a retired lieutenant colonel and Vietnam War veteran, was of mostly African American, as well as Caucasian, and possible Native American and Chinese, ancestry.[12] Kultida (née Punsawad), originally from Thailand (where Earl had met her on a tour of duty in 1968), is of mixed Thai, Chinese, and Dutch ancestry.[13] He refers to his ethnic make-up as "Cablinasian" (a syllabic abbreviation he coined from Caucasian, Black, American Indian, and Asian).[14]
Woods' first name, Eldrick, was coined by his mother because it began with "E" (for Earl) and ended with "K" (for Kultida). His middle name Tont is a traditional Thai name. He was nicknamed Tiger in honor of his father's friend Col. Vuong Dang Phong, who had also been known as Tiger.[15]
Woods has a niece, Cheyenne Woods, who played for Wake Forest University's golf team and turned professional in 2012, making her pro debut in the LPGA Championship.[16]

Woods grew up in Orange County, California. He was a child prodigy, introduced to golf before the age of two, by his athletic father Earl, a single-figure handicap amateur golfer who had been one of the earliest African-American college baseball players at Kansas State University.[17] In 1978, Tiger putted against comedian Bob Hope in a television appearance on The Mike Douglas Show. At age three, he shot a 48 over nine holes over the Cypress Navy course, and at age five, he appeared in Golf Digest and on ABC's That's Incredible.[18] Before turning seven, Tiger won the Under Age 10 section of the Drive, Pitch, and Putt competition, held at the Navy Golf Course in Cypress, California.[19] In 1984 at the age of eight, he won the 9–10 boys' event, the youngest age group available, at the Junior World Golf Championships.[20] He first broke 80 at age eight.[21] He went on to win the Junior World Championships six times, including four consecutive wins from 1988 to 1991.[22][23][24][25][26]
Woods' father Earl wrote that Tiger first defeated him at the age of 11 years, with Earl trying his best. Earl lost to Tiger every time from then on.[27][28] Woods first broke 70 on a regulation golf course at age 12.[29]
Woods' first major national junior tournament was the 1989 Big I, when he was 13 years old. Woods was paired with pro John Daly, then relatively unknown, in the final round; the event's format placed a professional with each group of juniors who had qualified. Daly birdied three of the last four holes to beat Woods by only one stroke.[30] As a young teenager, Woods first met Jack Nicklaus in Los Angeles at the Bel-Air Country Club, when Nicklaus was performing a clinic for the club's members. Woods was part of the show, and impressed Nicklaus and the crowd with his skills and potential.[31] Earl Woods had researched in detail the career accomplishments of Nicklaus, and had set his young son the goals of breaking those records.[29]
While attending Western High School in Anaheim at the age of 15, Woods became the youngest ever U.S. Junior Amateur champion (a record which stood until it was broken by Jim Liu in 2010).[32] He was named 1991's Southern California Amateur Player of the Year (for the second consecutive year) and Golf Digest Junior Amateur Player of the Year. In 1992, he defended his title at the U.S. Junior Amateur Championship, becoming the first multiple winner; competed in his first PGA Tour event, the Nissan Los Angeles Open (he missed the 36-hole cut); and was named Golf Digest Amateur Player of the Year, Golf World Player of the Year, and Golfweek National Amateur of the Year.[33][34]
The following year, Woods won his third consecutive U.S. Junior Amateur Championship; he remains the event's only three-time winner.[35] In 1994, at the TPC at Sawgrass in Florida, he became the youngest-ever winner of the U.S. Amateur Championship, a record he held until 2008 when it was broken by Danny Lee.[36] He was a member of the American team at the 1994 Eisenhower Trophy World Amateur Golf Team Championships (winning), and the 1995 Walker Cup (losing).[37][38]
Woods graduated from Western High School in 1994 at age 18, and was voted "Most Likely to Succeed" among the graduating class. He had starred for the high school's golf team under coach Don Crosby.[39]
Woods was recruited very heavily by college golf powers, and chose Stanford University, the 1994 NCAA Division I champions. He enrolled at Stanford in the fall of 1994 under a golf scholarship, winning his first collegiate event, the 40th Annual William H. Tucker Invitational, that September.[40] He declared a major in economics, and was nicknamed "Urkel" by college teammate Notah Begay III.[41] In 1995, he successfully defended his U.S. Amateur title at the Newport Country Club in Rhode Island[36] and was voted Pac-10 Player of the Year, NCAA First Team All-American, and Stanford's Male Freshman of the Year (an award that encompasses all sports).[42][43]
Woods participated in his first PGA Tour major, the 1995 Masters Tournament, and tied for 41st as the only amateur to make the cut. At age 20 in 1996, he became the first golfer to win three consecutive U.S. Amateur titles[44] and won the NCAA individual golf championship.[45] In winning the Silver Medal as leading amateur at The Open Championship, he tied the record for an amateur aggregate score of 281.[46] He left college after two years and turned professional. In 1996, Woods moved out of California, stating in 2013 that it was due to the state's tax rate.[47][48][49]
Woods became a professional golfer in August 1996, and immediately signed deals with Nike, Inc. and Titleist that ranked as the most lucrative endorsement contracts in golf history at that time.[50][51] Woods was named Sports Illustrated's 1996 Sportsman of the Year and PGA Tour Rookie of the Year.[52] In April 1997, he won his first major, the Masters, becoming the tournament's youngest-ever winner.[53] Two months later, he set the record for the fastest-ever ascent to No. 1 in the Official World Golf Rankings.[54] After a lackluster 1998, Woods finished the 1999 season with eight wins, including the PGA Championship, a feat not achieved since 1974.[55][56]
In 2000, Woods achieved six consecutive wins, the longest winning streak since 1948. One of these was the 2000 U.S. Open, where he broke or tied nine tournament records in what Sports Illustrated called "the greatest performance in golf history," in which Woods won the tournament by a 15-stroke margin and earned a check for $800,000.[57] At age 24, he became the youngest golfer to achieve the Career Grand Slam.[58] At the end of 2000, Woods had won nine of the twenty PGA Tour events he entered and had broken the record for lowest scoring average in tour history. He was named the Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, the only athlete to be honored twice, and was ranked by Golf Digest magazine as the twelfth-best golfer of all time.[59][60]
Woods' victory in the 2001 Masters Tournament made him the first player to hold all four major professional golf titles at the same time, although not in the same calendar year.[61] Following a stellar 2001 and 2002 in which Woods continued to dominate the tour, Woods' career hit a "slump".[55][62] He did not win a major in 2003 or 2004. In September 2004, Vijay Singh overtook Woods in the Official World Golf Rankings, ending Woods' record streak of 264 weeks at #1.[63]
Woods rebounded in 2005, winning six official PGA Tour money events and reclaiming the top spot in July after swapping it back and forth with Singh over the first half of the year.[64]
In 2006, Woods began dominantly, winning his first two PGA tournaments but failing to capture his fifth Masters championship in April.[65][66] Following the death of his father in May, Woods took a nine-week hiatus from the tour and appeared rusty upon his return at the U.S. Open, missing the cut at Winged Foot.[67] However, he quickly returned to form and ended the year by winning six consecutive tour events. At the season's close, with 54 wins and 12 majors wins, Woods had broken the tour records for both total wins and total majors wins over eleven seasons.[68]
Woods continued to excel in 2007 and the first part of 2008. In April 2008, he underwent knee surgery and missed the next two months on the tour.[69] Woods returned for the 2008 U.S. Open, where he struggled the first day but ultimately claimed a dramatic victory over Rocco Mediate, after which Mediate said, "This guy does things that are just not normal by any stretch of the imagination," and Kenny Perry added, "He beat everybody on one leg."[70][71][72] Two days later, Woods announced that he would miss the remainder of the season due to further knee surgery, and that his knee was more severely damaged than previously revealed, prompting even greater praise for his U.S. Open performance. Woods called it "my greatest ever championship."[73][74][75] In Woods' absence, TV ratings for the remainder of the season suffered a huge decline from 2007.[76]
Upon Woods' much-anticipated return in 2009, he performed well, including a spectacular performance at the 2009 Presidents Cup, but failed to win a major, the first year since 2004 that he had not done so.[77][78][79] After his marital infidelities came to light at the end of 2009 and received massive media coverage, Woods announced in December that he would be taking an indefinite break from competitive golf. In February 2010, he delivered a televised apology for his behavior. During this period, several companies ended their endorsement deals with Woods.
Woods returned to competition in April at the 2010 Masters Tournament, where he finished in a tie for fourth place.[80] He followed the Masters with poor showings at the Quail Hollow Championship and the Players Championship, where he withdrew in the fourth round citing injury.[81] Shortly afterward, Hank Haney, Woods' coach since 2003, resigned the position; he was replaced in August by Sean Foley. The rest of the season went badly for Woods, who failed to win a single event for the first time since turning professional, while nevertheless finishing the season ranked No. 2 in the world.
Woods' performance continued to suffer in 2011, taking its toll on his ranking. After falling to No. 7 in March, he rebounded to No. 5 with a strong showing at the 2011 Masters Tournament, where he tied for fourth place.[82][83][84] Due to leg injuries incurred at the Masters, he missed several summer events; in July he fired his longtime caddy Steve Williams, replacing him temporarily with friend Bryon Bell.[85][86] After returning to tournament play in August, Woods continued to falter, and his ranking gradually fell to a low of #58.[8] He rose to No. 50 in mid-November after a third-place finish at the Emirates Australian Open, and broke his winless streak with a victory at December's Chevron World Challenge.[8][87]
Woods began his 2012 season with two tournaments (the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship and the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am) where he started off well, but struggled on the final rounds. Following the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, where he was knocked out in the second round by missing a 5-foot putt,[88] Woods revised his putting technique and tied for second at the Honda Classic, with the lowest final round score in his PGA Tour career. After a short time off due to another leg injury, Woods won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, his first win on the PGA Tour since the BMW Championship in September 2009. Following several dismal performances, Woods notched his 73rd PGA Tour win at the Memorial Tournament in June, tying Jack Nicklaus' record for most PGA Tour victories;[89] a month later, Woods surpassed Nicklaus' record with a win at the AT&T National.[90]
2013 would bring a return of Woods' dominating play. He won the Farmers Insurance Open in January 2013 by four shots for his 75th PGA Tour win. It was the seventh time he had won the event.[91] In March, he won the WGC-Cadillac Championship, also for the seventh time, giving him his 17th WGC title and first since 2009.[92] Two weeks later, he won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, winning the event for a record-tying 8th time. The win moved him back to the top of the world rankings.[93] To commemorate that achievement, Nike was quick to launch an ad with the tagline "winning takes care of everything".[94]
On April 13, 2013, Woods was up for disqualification from the 2013 Masters Tournament over claims he took an illegal drop after his third shot on the par-5 15th hole bounced off of the pin and into the water. After further review, Woods was assessed a two-stroke penalty for the drop and not disqualified.[95] He finished T4 in the event. Woods won The Players Championship in May 2013, his second career win at the event, notching his fourth win of the 2013 season. It was the quickest he had ever gotten to four wins in any season in his professional career.
Woods had a poor showing at the 2013 U.S Open as a result of an elbow injury sustained at The Players Championship. In finishing at +13, he recorded his worst score ever as a professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner Justin Rose. After a prolonged break because of the injury, during which he missed the Greenbrier Classic and his own AT&T National, he returned at the Open Championship at Muirfield. Despite being in contention all week and beginning the final round only two stokes behind Lee Westwood, he struggled with the speed of the greens and could only manage a 3-over-par 74 which left him tied for 6th place, five strokes behind eventual winner Phil Mickelson. Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15 year history. His second round 61 matched his record score on the PGA Tour and could easily have been a 59 were it not for some short missed birdie putts on the closing holes. This gave him a seven stroke lead which he held on to for the rest of the tournament. Woods would never contend at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club and would come short of winning a major for the 5th full season, only contending in two of the four majors in 2013.
After a slow start to 2014, Woods injured himself during the Honda Classic and was unable to finish, withdrawing after 13 holes of the final round citing back pain.[96] He subsequently competed in the WGC-Cadillac Championship but was visibly in pain during much of the last round. He was forced to skip the Arnold Palmer Invitational at the end of March 2014[97] and, on April 1, announced that he would miss the Masters Tournament for the first time since 1994 after undergoing a microdiscectomy.[98]
On August 20, 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver announced that Woods would be inducted into the California Hall of Fame. He was inducted December 5, 2007 at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts in Sacramento.[99][100]
He has been named "Athlete of the Decade" by the Associated Press in December 2009.[101] He has been named Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year a record-tying four times, and is the only person to be named Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year more than once.
Since his record-breaking win at the 1997 Masters Tournament, golf's increased popularity is commonly attributed to Woods' presence. He is credited by some sources for dramatically increasing prize money in golf, generating interest in new audiences, and for drawing the largest TV audiences in golf history.[52][102][103][104][105][106]
During the first decade of his professional career, Woods was the world's most marketable athlete.[107] Shortly after his 21st birthday in 1996, he began signing endorsement deals with numerous companies, including General Motors, Titleist, General Mills, American Express, Accenture, and Nike, Inc. In 2000, he signed a 5-year, $105 million contract extension with Nike. It was the largest endorsing deal ever signed by an athlete at that time.[108] Woods' endorsement has been credited with playing a significant role in taking the Nike Golf brand from a "start-up" golf company earlier in the past decade, to becoming the leading golf apparel company in the world, and a major player in the equipment and golf ball market.[107][109] Nike Golf is one of the fastest growing brands in the sport, with an estimated $600 million in sales.[110] Woods has been described as the "ultimate endorser" for Nike Golf,[110] frequently seen wearing Nike gear during tournaments, and even in advertisements for other products.[108] Woods receives a percentage from the sales of Nike Golf apparel, footwear, golf equipment, golf balls,[107] and has a building named after him at Nike's headquarters campus in Beaverton, Oregon.[111]

In 2002, Woods was involved in every aspect of the launch of Buick's Rendezvous SUV. A company spokesman stated that Buick was happy with the value of Woods' endorsement, pointing out that more than 130,000 Rendezvous vehicles were sold in 2002 and 2003. "That exceeded our forecasts," he was quoted as saying, "It has to be in recognition of Tiger." In February 2004, Buick renewed Woods' endorsement contract for another five years, in a deal reportedly worth $40 million.[108]
Woods collaborated closely with TAG Heuer to develop the world's first professional golf watch, released in April 2005.[112] The lightweight, titanium-construction watch, designed to be worn while playing the game, incorporates numerous innovative design features to accommodate golf play. It is capable of absorbing up to 5,000 Gs of shock, far in excess of the forces generated by a normal golf swing.[112] In 2006, the TAG Heuer Professional Golf Watch won the prestigious iF product design award in the Leisure/Lifestyle category.[113]
Woods also endorses the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series of video games; he has done so since 1999.[114] In 2006, he signed a six-year contract with Electronic Arts, the series' publisher.[115]
In February 2007, along with Roger Federer and Thierry Henry, Woods became an ambassador for the "Gillette Champions" marketing campaign. Gillette did not disclose financial terms, though an expert estimated the deal could total between $10 million and $20 million.[116]
In October 2007, Gatorade announced that Woods would have his own brand of sports drink starting in March 2008. "Gatorade Tiger" was his first U.S. deal with a beverage company and his first licensing agreement. Although no figures were officially disclosed, Golfweek magazine reported that it was for five years and could pay him as much as $100 million.[117] The company decided in early fall 2009 to discontinue the drink due to weak sales.[118]
According to Golf Digest, Woods made $769,440,709 from 1996 to 2007,[119] and the magazine predicted that by 2010, Woods would pass one billion dollars in earnings.[120] In 2009, Forbes confirmed that Woods was indeed the world's first athlete to earn over a billion dollars in his career (before taxes), after accounting for the $10 million bonus Woods received for the FedEx Cup title.[121][122] The same year, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $600 million, making him the second richest "African American" behind only Oprah Winfrey.[123]
In July 2011, Woods appeared on a 15-second Japanese television commercial, endorsing a heat back rub by Kowa Co., the Vantelin Kowa rub. Details of the deal, which was made in late 2010, were not disclosed.[124]
In October 2012, it was announced that Woods had signed an exclusive endorsement deal with Fuse Science, Inc, a sports nutrition firm.[125]
A case was initiated in 1997 by Woods and fellow golfer, Arnold Palmer in the effort to stop the unauthorized sale of their images and alleged signatures in the memorabilia market against Bruce Matthews, the owner of Gotta Have It Golf, Inc. and others. Matthews and associated parties, counter claimed that Woods and his company, ETW Corporation committed several acts including, breach of contract, breach of implied duty of good faith and violations of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. [126] Palmer was also named in the counter-suit, accused of violating the same licensing agreement in conjunction with his company Arnold Palmer Enterprises.
On March 12, 2014, a Florida jury found in favor of Gotta Have It on its breach of contract and other related claims, rejected ETW's counterclaims, and awarded Gotta Have It $668,346 in damages.[127][128] The award may end up exceeding $1 million once interest has been factored in, though the ruling may be appealed.
Early in Woods' career, a small number of golf experts expressed concern about his impact on the competitiveness of the game and the public appeal of professional golf. Sportswriter Bill Lyon of Knight-Ridder asked in a column, "Isn't Tiger Woods actually bad for golf?" (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he was not).[129] At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week.
A related effect was measured by economist Jennifer Brown of the University of California, Berkeley who found that other golfers played worse when competing against Woods than when he was not in the tournament. The scores of highly skilled (exempt) golfers are nearly one stroke higher when playing against Woods. This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in 2003–04. Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when facing a "superstar" competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort.[130]
Many courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including Major Championship sites like Augusta National) have added yardage to their tees in an effort to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods, a strategy that became known as "Tiger-Proofing". Woods said he welcomed the change, in that adding yardage to courses did not affect his ability to win.[131]
When Woods first joined the professional tour in 1996, his long drives had a large impact on the world of golf.[132][133] However, when he did not upgrade his equipment in the following years (insisting upon the use of True Temper Dynamic Gold steel-shafted clubs and smaller steel clubheads that promoted accuracy over distance),[134] many opponents caught up to him. Phil Mickelson even made a joke in 2003 about Woods using "inferior equipment", which did not sit well with Nike, Titleist or Woods.[135][136] During 2004, Woods finally upgraded his driver technology to a larger clubhead and graphite shaft, which, coupled with his clubhead speed, made him one of the Tour's lengthier players off the tee once again.
Despite his power advantage, Woods has always focused on developing an excellent all-around game. Although in recent years he has typically been near the bottom of the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for putting in more hours of practice than most.[137][138][139]
From mid-1993, while he was still an amateur, until 2004, Woods worked almost exclusively with leading swing coach Butch Harmon. From mid-1997, Harmon and Woods fashioned a major redevelopment of Woods' full swing, achieving greater consistency, better distance control, and better kinesiology. The changes began to pay off in 1999.[140] From March 2004 to 2010, Woods was coached by Hank Haney, who worked on flattening his swing plane. Woods continued to win tournaments with Haney, but his driving accuracy dropped significantly. Haney resigned in May 2010 and was replaced by Sean Foley. [141]
Mike "Fluff" Cowan served as Woods' caddy from the start of his professional career until March 1999.[142] He was replaced by Steve Williams, who became a close friend of Woods and is often credited with helping him with key shots and putts.[143] In June 2011, Woods fired Williams and replaced him with Woods' friend Bryon Bell, on an interim basis. Joe LaCava, a former caddy of both Fred Couples and Dustin Johnson, was hired by Woods shortly after.[144]

The Tiger Woods Foundation was established in 1996 by Woods and his father Earl, with the primary goal of promoting golf among inner-city children.[148][149] The foundation has conducted junior golf clinics across the country, and sponsors the Tiger Woods Foundation National Junior Golf Team in the Junior World Golf Championships.[150][151] As of December 2010, TWF employed approximately 55 people.[152][153]
The foundation operates the Tiger Woods Learning Center, a $50 million, 35,000-square-foot facility in Anaheim, California, providing college-access programs for underserved youth.[150][152][154] The TWLC opened in 2006 and features seven classrooms, extensive multi-media facilities and an outdoor golf teaching area.[150] The center has since expanded to four additional campuses: two in Washington, DC; one in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and one in Stuart, Florida.[154]

The foundation benefits from the annual Chevron World Challenge and AT&T National golf tournaments hosted by Woods.[152] In October 2011, the foundation hosted the first Tiger Woods Invitational at Pebble Beach.[155] Other annual fundraisers have included the concert events Block Party, last held in 2009 in Anaheim, and Tiger Jam, last held in 2011 in Las Vegas after a one-year hiatus.[152][156][157][158]
In November 2006, Woods announced his intention to begin designing golf courses around the world through a new company, Tiger Woods Design.[159] A month later, he announced that the company's first course would be in Dubai as part of a 25.3 million-square-foot development, The Tiger Woods Dubai.[160] The Al Ruwaya Golf Course was initially expected to finish construction in 2009.[160] As of February 2010, only seven holes had been completed; in April 2011, The New York Times reported that the project had been shelved permanently.[161][162] In 2013, the parntership between Tiger Woods Design and Dubai Holding was dissolved.[163]
Tiger Woods Design has taken on two other courses, neither of which has materialized. In August 2007, Woods announced The Cliffs at High Carolina, a private course in the Blue Ridge Mountains near Asheville, North Carolina.[164] After a groundbreaking in November 2008, the project suffered cash flow problems and suspended construction.[162] A third course, in Punta Brava, Mexico, was announced in October 2008, but incurred delays due to issues with permits and an environmental impact study.[162][165] Construction on the Punta Brava course has not yet begun.[162]
The problems encountered by these projects have been credited to factors including overly optimistic estimates of their value; declines throughout the global economy, particularly the U.S. crash in home prices; and decreased appeal of Woods following his 2009 infidelity scandal.[162]
Woods wrote a golf instruction column for Golf Digest magazine from 1997 to February 2011.[166] In 2001 he wrote a best-selling golf instruction book, How I Play Golf, which had the largest print run of any golf book for its first edition, 1.5 million copies.[167]
In November 2003, Woods became engaged to Elin Nordegren, a Swedish former model and daughter of former minister of migration Barbro Holmberg and radio journalist Thomas Nordegren.[168] They were introduced during The Open Championship in 2001 by Swedish golfer Jesper Parnevik, who had employed her as an au pair. They married on October 5, 2004, at the Sandy Lane resort in Barbados, and lived at Isleworth, a community in Windermere, a suburb of Orlando, Florida.[169][170] In 2006, they purchased a $39 million estate in Jupiter Island, Florida, and began constructing a 10,000-square-foot home; Woods moved there in 2010 following the couple's divorce.[170][171]
Woods and Nordegren's first child, a daughter named Sam Alexis Woods, was born in 2007. Woods chose the name because his own father had always called him Sam.[172] Their son, Charlie Axel Woods, was born in 2009.[173]
On November 25, 2009, supermarket tabloid The National Enquirer published a story claiming that Woods had an extramarital affair with New York City nightclub manager Rachel Uchitel, a claim she denied.[174] Two days later, around 2:30 a.m. on November 27, Woods left home in his Cadillac Escalade SUV and, while still on his street, collided with a fire hydrant, a tree, and several hedges.[175] He was treated for minor facial lacerations and received a ticket for careless driving.[175][176] Following intense media speculation about the accident, Woods released a statement on his website taking sole responsibility for the accident, calling it a "private matter" and crediting his wife for helping him from the car.[177][178] On November 30, Woods announced that he would not be appearing at his own charity golf tournament, the Chevron World Challenge, nor any other tournaments in 2009, due to his injuries.[179]
On December 2, following the release by US Weekly of a voicemail message allegedly left by Tiger for a mistress, Woods released another statement in which he admitted "transgressions" and apologized to "all of those who have supported [him] over the years", while reiterating his and his family's right to privacy.[174][180] Over the next few days, more than a dozen women claimed in various media outlets to have had affairs with Woods.[6] On December 11, he released a third statement admitting to infidelity and apologizing again, as well as announcing that he would be taking "an indefinite break from professional golf."[6]
In the days and months following Woods' admission of infidelity, several companies re-evaluated their relationships with him. Accenture, AT&T, Gatorade and General Motors completely ended their sponsorship deals, while Gillette suspended advertising featuring Woods.[181][182][183] TAG Heuer dropped Woods from advertising in December 2009 and officially ended their deal when his contract expired in August 2011.[181][184] The magazine Golf Digest suspended Woods' monthly column beginning with the February 2010 issue.[185] In contrast, Nike continued to support Woods, as did Electronic Arts, which was working with Woods on the game Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online.[186] A December 2009 study estimated the shareholder loss caused by Woods' affairs to be between $5 billion and $12 billion.[187][188][189]
On February 19, 2010, Woods gave a televised statement in which he said he had been in a 45-day therapy program since the end of December. He again apologized for his actions. "I thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to," he said. "I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. I felt I was entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn't have to go far to find them. I was wrong. I was foolish." He said he did not know yet when he would be returning to golf.[190][191] He announced a few weeks later on March 16 that he would be returning at the 2010 Masters Tournament on April 8.[192]
From childhood Woods was raised as a Buddhist, and he actively practiced this faith from childhood until well into his adult professional golf career.[194] In a 2000 article, Woods was quoted as saying he "believes in Buddhism... Not every aspect, but most of it."[195] He has attributed his deviations and infidelity to his losing track of Buddhism. He said, "Buddhism teaches me to stop following every impulse and to learn restraint. Obviously I lost track of what I was taught."[196]
Tiger Woods is registered to vote as an independent.[197] In January 2009, Woods delivered a speech commemorating the military at the We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial.[198][199] In April 2009, Woods visited the White House while in the Washington, D.C. area promoting the golf tournament he hosts, the AT&T National.[200]
Woods underwent laser eye surgery in 1999. Before this surgery, Woods' eyesight was minus 11, meaning he was almost legally blind. He considered the surgery a big help in his career and a good alternative to the glasses and contact lenses.[201] He immediately started winning tour events after the surgery. He received money from TLC Laser Eye Centers to endorse them.[202] In 2007, he had a second laser eye surgery when his vision began to deteriorate again.[203]
Woods has won 79 official PGA Tour events including 14 majors. He is 14–1 when going into the final round of a major with at least a share of the lead. He has been heralded as "the greatest closer in history" by multiple golf experts.[205][206][207] He owns the lowest career scoring average and the most career earnings of any player in PGA Tour history.
Woods victory at the 2013 Players Championship also marked a win in his 300th PGA Tour start.[208] He also won golf tournaments in his 100th (in 2000) and 200th (in 2006) tour starts.[209][210]
Woods has spent the most consecutive and cumulative weeks atop the world rankings. He is one of five players (along with Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, and Jack Nicklaus) to have won all four professional major championships in his career, known as the Career Grand Slam, and was the youngest to do so.[211] Woods is the only player to have won all four professional major championships in a row, accomplishing the feat in the 2000–2001 seasons.

	                Check out Tiger's latest video gameTiger Woods is the only child of Earl Woods, a retired US Army lieutenant colonel who fought in Vietnam, and his wife Kutilda, a native of Thailand. The couple had met in Bangkok during the Vietnam War and named their son Eldrick. He was nicknamed Tiger after his father’s friend, Vuong Dang Phong, a Vietnamese soldier whom Earl had also called Tiger. Close to his parents, Woods had a happy childhood growing up in Cypress, near Los Angeles, California. He remembers loving his bicycle and skateboard but his intense interest in golf began very young. He was a mere six months old when he would watch and mimic his father hitting golf balls into a net. At age two he was putting with Bob Hope on the Mike Douglas Show and at age three he played a round of 48 for nine holes. Golf Digest featured the five-year-old Woods and he appeared on ABC’s ‘That’s Incredible’. He was eight when he won the 1984 Junior World Golf Championships, having to enter the 9-10 boys’ event as it was the youngest group available. He went on to win the Optimist International Junior tournament six times, at ages 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 15. To this day, he is the event’s youngest ever player and the only multiple winner. Suffering with a bad stutter as a boy, his intense desire to win helped him overcome it, largely by talking to the eternally patient family dog, but also trying extra hard at school. He attended Western High School in Anaheim, California. At age 16, Woods entered his first professional tournament, the 1992 Nissan Los Angeles Open and in 1993, he played in three PGA Tour events. In 1994, he tied for 34th place in the Johnnie Walker Asian Classic in Thailand and participated in three more PGA Tour events before starting at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. Also in 1994, he won the Western Amateur and represented the US in the World Amateur Golf Team Championships in France, becoming the youngest person ever to win the event. He won the 1995 Walker Cup Match in Wales. As an amateur golfer, Woods achieved an impressive amount, winning six USGA national championships as well as the NCAA title. He was the 1991 and 1992 Golf Digest Player of the Year, 1994 Golfweek National Amateur of the Year and chosen for the Fred Haskins and Jack Nicklaus College Player of the Year awards in 1996. The final flourish in his amateur career was to win his third consecutive US Amateur title, ending with a record 18 consecutive match-play victories. No one before Woods had won the US Junior Amateur more than once and he was the youngest ever to win it, at age 15 in 1991. He was also the youngest player ever to win the US Amateur title, at age 18 in 1994. With all his golfing talent, Woods decided to leave college after being there two years, in order to enter the sport professionally.On 27 August 1996, he became a professional golfer at the age of 20, under the guidance of coach Butch Harmon, and was soon to prove to the world that he was somewhat of a golfing prodigy. In order for Woods to earn a player’s card for the PGA Tour, there were only seven events left in 1996 in which he could prove himself. His first tournament as a professional golfer was the 1996 Greater Milwaukee Open in which he tied for 60th place, winning $2,544, his first cheque as a professional player. Woods remains justifiably proud of winning two of the remaining 1996 tournaments, as well as being placed in the top 30 money winners qualifying for the Tour Championship and finishing overall in 25th place. He had more than earned his professional player’s card. Woods was selected as Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year in 1996, an honour that he would again enjoy in 2000, making him the first person to win it more than once. He was also named 1996 PGA Rookie of the Year. On 15 June 1997, at age 21 years, 24 weeks, he won the season-opening Mercedes Championships with a birdie in a playoff with Tom Lehman, making him the youngest ever number one golfer, taking the title from Bernhard Langer who was youngest in 1986 at age 29 years, 31 weeks. Winning The Masters by a record margin of twelve strokes, he then became the youngest Masters winner at age 21 years, three months and 14 days. To this day, it is the winning of The Masters that is his proudest moment. He also became the first major championship winner of African or Asian heritage. Woods went on to win four PGA Tour events in 1997, as well as one overseas. He gained the 1997 Arnold Palmer Award when he became the leading money winner, with a then-record £2,066,833 and a worldwide earning of £2,440,831 over 25 events. In 1997, Woods achieved the most rapid progression ever to number one position on the Official World Golf Rankings and he later remained in Rankings top position for a record 264 consecutive weeks, from 15 August 1999 to 29 August 2004. The Associated Press named Woods Male Athlete of the Year in 1997 and again in 1999 and 2000, making him the only athlete besides Michael Jordan to win the award three times. He was 1997 ESPY Male Athlete of the Year, in a tie with Ken Griffey Jr., and again in 1999 and 2000. He was selected Player of the Year in 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 by the PGA Tour, winning the Jack Nicklaus Award, the PGA of America and the Golf Writers Association of America.Woods beat South African Ernie Els in the 1998 Johnnie Walker Classic in Thailand in a dramatic playoff. He had been eleven strokes behind Els after two rounds and clinched his victory with a birdie on the second playoff hole. 1999 was his third full season as a professional, and Woods was showing everyone just how talented he was. He had eight wins on the PGA Tour, including the PGA Championship, and earned £6,616,585, which was a full £2,974,679 more than second place David Duval. In fact, he won 52 percent of the possible prize money, which was nearly 82 percent more than the runner-up. Woods achieved another record by being the first player since Johnny Miller in 1974 to have eight PGA Tour victories in one year. Ending 1999 with a flourish, he won four consecutive PGA Tour events and then had two more, making a total of six successive wins. In 1999 and 2000, he was named World Sportsman of the Year, as voted by the founding members of the World Sports Academy for the Laureus Sports Awards. In 2000, he was chosen as the World Champion of Champions by L’Equipe in France and Reuters selected him as Sportsman of the Year. Whilst the accolades were rolling in, Woods continued to concentrate on improving his game and it showed. His adjusted scoring average for 2000 was 67.79 strokes, which was the lowest ever achieved and which broke his own record of 68.43 in 1999. For this performance, Woods won the Bryon Nelson Award on the PGA Tour as well as the Vardon Trophy from the PGA of America. His actual scoring average in 2000 was 68.17 strokes, which broke Nelson’s 1945 record of 68.33 strokes. Winning his first British Open Championships in 2000, he became the youngest to complete the career Grand Slam of professional major championships and the fifth ever to do so. The previous four golfers were Ben Hogan, Gene Sarazen, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus. With his second Masters victory in 2001, Woods became the first ever to hold all four professional major championships at the same time, a feat dubbed the “Tiger Slam”. He went on to win The Masters Tournaments in 2001, 2002 and 2005. He won the 1999, 2000 and 2006 PGA Championships and the 2000 and 2002 US Open Championships. He became the first since Denny Shute in 1936-7 to win the PGA championship in consecutive years. Woods also won the 2005 and 2006 British Open Championships.In 2000, he won no less than eleven tournaments (nine on PGA Tour, one on PGA European Tour and the PGA Grand Slam) as well as winning the World Cup team title for the United States, with David Duval. His nine PGA Tour victories were the fifth highest total ever and were the most since Sam Snead’s eleven wins in 1950. In 2001, he had five wins on the PGA Tour and eight wins worldwide. In 2002, five wins on the PGA Tour and seven wins worldwide made him the PGA Tour’s leading money winner for the fourth consecutive year with £6,912,625 and £8,417,188 worldwide. He holds the record for the lowest score in relation to par, in each of the four major championships. His records are 270 (18 under par) in the Masters, 272 (12 under par) in the US Open, 269 (19 under par) in the British Open, and 270 (18 under par) in the 2000 PGA Championship, a record he shares with Bob May. With everything going brilliantly in his career, the 28-year-old golf superstar’s personal life was also taking an upturn. In November 2003, Woods and his Swedish model girlfriend, Elin Nordegren, were engaged. They were married on 5 October 2004 and took a honeymoon cruise on their boat to Puerto Rico. In March 2004, Woods began being coached by Hank Haney and that year, was named the highest earning US sportsman, with a total of $89.4 million in winnings and endorsements. Since his 21st birthday, Woods has signed several endorsement deals, including American Express, General Motors, General Mills, Accenture and Nike. His five-year, £100 million contract with Nike was, at the time, the largest endorsement deal ever signed by an athlete. He also endorses the ‘Tiger Woods PGA Tour’ video game series and collaborated with Tag Heuer in developing the world’s first professional golf watch, released in April 2005. In early January 2006, in celebration of his 30th birthday (30 December 2005), Woods bought a luxury estate on Jupiter Island, Florida. Once again breaking records, the $40 million he paid was the highest sale price for property in what has been dubbed the ‘Most Expensive ZIP Code’.Sadly, the high that Woods was experiencing would soon all come crashing down. He was devastated when Earl Woods, his 74-year-old father, died on 3 May 2006 after his long battle against prostate cancer. Woods had lost one of his most important mentors and a father he had always dearly loved. He took nine weeks out from golfing in order to be with his family. When he returned for the 2006 US Open, it was evident that his heart wasn’t entirely in his game and for the first time in his professional career, he failed to qualify for the weekend at a major. With his steely core of determination and perhaps remembering his father’s words to him as a young man, “I promise you one thing: you’ll never meet another person as tough as you”, Woods bounced back with an improved game. He won the British Open with 18 under par and was quite emotional when he dedicated his victory to the memory of his father. A few weeks later, he won the PGA Championship with another 18 below par and with only three bogeys, he tied for fewest bogeys in a major. Feeling strongly about the parental support he had enjoyed, Woods wanted to share that with the community. In February 2006, he opened the first ‘Tiger Woods Learning Center’ in Anaheim, California, not far from where he grew up. He put in over $5 million for the foundation that aims to provide children aged 10 to 18 with mentoring and guidance. After consultation with the children of the community to find out what they wanted to see on the curriculum, the foundation offers courses such as computers, creative writing and rocketry. Also planned are summer programmes, weekend and community outreach programmes. The extensive multi-media facilities will allow the opportunity for online learning and the centre has an outdoor area for teaching golf. Claiming this project was closer to his heart than golf, Woods plans to open more centres of this kind around the world. Woods arranges an annual fund raising concert called ‘Tiger Jam’ and donates his winnings from the annual off-season charity golf tournament, the Target World Challenge, to his foundation. His Tiger Woods Foundation National Junior Golf Team has eighteen members and competes in the annual Junior World Golf Championships.The Tavistock Group, which includes Woods and Ernie Els, recently bought an estate in New Providence in the Bahamas, with plans to develop an exclusive residential community there. Prior to the modernisation of the secluded Albany House, it was used as the location for the filming of several scenes in the Bond movie ‘Casino Royale’. The film was the first Ian Fleming James Bond novel and hit cinemas in November 2006 with Daniel Craig as Bond. Believing it necessary to support children, especially those disadvantaged in any way, Woods has been involved in youth projects and charities since he and his father, Earl, established The Tiger Woods Foundation in 1996. The projects include golf clinics that culminate in a community festival, a grant programme, university scholarships and the ‘Start Something’ character development programme, which by 2003 had more than a million participants. Somewhat of a child prodigy, his drive, skill and determination to pursue his dream, along with the unfailing support he received from his parents, have made Woods the phenomenal sportsman and thoroughly likeable man he is today. In the words of his late father, Earl Woods, “He doesn't need a challenge, I think that is the worst misconception going: That the number-one golfer needs a number-two golfer to push him. Tiger is pushed by history and by records and by his own goals. He doesn't need anybody pushing him.” By 2010, Woods had won 14 professional major golf championships, placing him second to Jack Nicklaus who leads with 18, and bagged 71 PGA Tour trophies, placing him third of all time. Figures from Sports Illustrated's SI.com also revealed that Woods was the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, having earned an estimated $90.5 million from winnings and endorsements in 2010. However, the same year turned into a nightmare for the world's best golfer when lurid details that had begun emerging about his private life in 2009 unravelled into a global scandal. His well groomed image of "Mr Clean" started falling apart when the National Enquirer revealed in November 2009 that he had had an affair with nightclub manager Rachel Uchitel. The next few weeks turned his life upside down when the media cottoned onto the story, leading to the emergence of a dozen women, including porn actresses, who claimed to have had affairs with Woods. Despite issuing an apology expressing regret for "transgressions" and saying "I have let my family down", sponsors and advertisers started cutting ties with him. Long-term sponsors including Gillette, Accenture, Nielsen and AT&T cut him loose. Woods and his wife Elin officially divorced in August 2010 and two months later a bad year became worse when he also lost the world number one ranking to Lee Westwood in October.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          At age 21, Tiger Woods became the youngest Masters champ and the first golfer since Jerry Pate in 1976 to win in the first major he played. In 1997, Woods took the lead at the Augusta golf classic and then put on a golf clinic never seen before. He fired a 3-under-par 69 and broke the tournament 72-hole record with an unbelievable 18-under 270. The 12-stroke margin of victory was the largest in Masters history. Woods was chosen as the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year and ESPY Male Athlete of the Year in 1997. He was also one of the most accomplished amateur golfers in history, winning six USGA national championships, an NCAA title during his two years at Stanford University, and an unprecedented three consecutive U.S. Amateur Championships. He finished first on the PGA Tour five times in 1999. More importantly, Woods opened wide a door of society in becoming the first African American, as well as the first Asian American, to win a major. Woods was granted dual citizenship by the Thai government (his mother, Kultida, is of half Thai and one quarter Chinese, descent) in 1997 prior to playing in the Asian Honda Classic. Woods has captured the hearts and imaginations of even non-golf fans around the world. Affable and good looking, he became an international star and a prime endorser of golfing equipment and apparel. Born Eldrick Woods on December 30, 1975, in Cypress, California, his distinctive nickname "Tiger" came from his father Earl's Green Beret army past. "Tiger" had been the moniker of a South Vietnamese officer who saved Earl's life on several occasions. As a child, Woods was one of junior golf's most accomplished players. He putted against Bob Hope on The Mike Douglas Show (1961) at the improbable age of 2, shot 48 for nine holes at age 3, and was featured in "Golf Digest" at age 5. Woods won several major youth titles in southern California. He won three straight U.S. Amateur titles in 1994, 1995 and 1996 after winning three consecutive U.S. Junior Amateur titles in 1991, 1992 and 1993. He turned professional in the summer of 1996, and the game of golf hasn't been the same since. Sense of humor intact, Woods once observed, "Hockey is a sport for white men. Basketball is a sport for black men. Golf is a sport for white men dressed like black pimps".

      Returns to golf at The Masters after a hiatus from the sport lasting nearly five months [April 2010]
      I think the best thing is being able to play golf competitively for a living. Ever since I was a little boy, that's something I've always wanted to do, and now I get a chance to live out my dreams.
      I've done it before. It won't be the last time. You're going to go years where you just don't win. That's okay, as long as you keep trying to improve.
      I am pretty health-conscious, so when my girlfriend and/or I make dinner--no, I don't have a cook!--we choose the healthier options: lean meats, steamed veggies, fish, etc. Of course, there are always those cravings for the "bad foods" that I do give in to once in a while!
      My body is a little bit sore from all of the practicing and playing and training, and your mind gets a little tired of it, too. It's nice to be able to recharge and come back fresh for the remainder of the year.
      We have a lot of fun every year, and I really enjoy being part of junior golf and the development of these players.

For more Tiger Woods trivia, try one (or all) of the Tiger Woods QuizzesTiger Woods Biography:The world had never before seen a golfing phenom the likes of Tiger Woods. A golfer whose amazing youth and amateur exploits were followed up by equally amazing professional exploits. 
Woods was imitating his father's golf swing at age 6 months, while still in his crib. At age 2, he appeared on the "Mike Douglas Show" and putted with Bob Hope. At age 3, he shot 48 for 9 holes, and at age 5 he was featured in Golf Digest.And then the really impressive stuff started. Woods won the Optimist International Junior tournament 6 times, starting at age 8. He won three U.S. Junior Amateurs, the first to do so. His first of three straight U.S. Amateur titles came in 1994.
He turned pro in late summer 1996 and played 7 tournaments on the PGA Tour, needing to finish in the Top 125 in money to avoid having to go through Q-School. Woods won twice and posted 5 straight Top 5 finishes.
In 1997, he won The Masters for his first major. Woods won just once in 1998, but in 1999 he began a string of consecutive Player of the Year awards that didn't end until Vijay Singh won the title in 2004.
He won 8 times in 1999, then 9 more times in 2000. Woods' 2000 season is arguably the best ever on the PGA Tour. He became the second golfer to win three professional majors in one year and broke Byron Nelson's more-than-50-year-old scoring average record.
In 2001, when he won the Masters, Woods became the first golfer to hold all four professional majors at the same time.
Tiger Woods holds or shares the record for the low score in relation to par in all four professional majors. He's won the U.S. Open by 15 strokes, the Masters by 12 and the British Open by 8 strokes.
A swing change slowed his winning a bit in 2004, and his record streak of consecutive cuts ended at 142 in 2005. But he roared back with two majors in '05.
Woods took a couple months off in 2006 following the death of his father, and missed the cut in his return at the U.S. Open. But then he won the next two majors and reeled off wins in the next eight tournaments he played.
In 2008, Woods won a dramatic playoff victory in the U.S. Open, then revealed that he was playing with a torn ACL and with a fracture in his leg. He underwent surgery shortly after and missed the next eight months. The 2009 WGC Accenture Match Play Championship marked his return.
In late 2009, Woods was involved in a 1-car accident outside his Florida home that started a chain of events leading to him undergoing counseling for sex addiction, the revelation of multiple mistresses, and divorce from wife Elin. On the heels of that, Woods had his first winless season as a professional in 2010.
Woods went winless again in tour events in 2011, but did win his own Chevron World Challenge late in the year. He finally got back in the PGA Tour winner's circle with a 5-shot victory at the 2012 Arnold Palmer Invitational.
In 2013, he won the Arnold Palmer Invitational again, for the eighth time, tying Sam Snead's record for most wins in the same tournament.
The Tiger Woods Foundation, launched by Woods and his father in 1996, has raised millions of dollars to help underprivileged youth get started in golf and succeed in life. He has also launched a golf course design business.

Eldrick (Tiger) Woods, now 38 years of age, has had an unprecedented career since becoming a professional golfer in the late summer of 1996. He has won 105 tournaments, 79 of those on the PGA TOUR, including the 1997, 2001, 2002 and 2005 Masters Tournaments, 1999, 2000, 2006 and 2007 PGA Championships, 2000, 2002, and 2008 U.S. Open Championships, and 2000, 2005 and 2006 Open Championships. With his second Masters victory in 2001, Tiger became the first ever to hold all four professional major championships at the same time.
In winning the 2000 British Open, Woods became the youngest to complete the career Grand Slam of professional major championships and only the fifth ever to do so, following Ben Hogan, Gene Sarazen, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus. Tiger also was the youngest Masters champion ever, at the age of 21 years, three months and 14 days, and was the first major championship winner of African or Asian heritage.
Woods holds or shares the record for the low score in relation to par in three of the four major championships. His records are 270 (18-under par) in the 1997 Masters, 269 (19-under par) in the 2000 British Open, and he shares the record of 270 (18-under par) with Bob May in the 2000 PGA Championship, which Tiger won by one stroke in a three-hole playoff. He held the U.S. Open records of 272 and 12-under par (set in the 2000) until 2011.
The U.S. Open and Masters victories came by record margins, 15 strokes and 12 strokes, respectively, and the U.S. Open triumph swept aside the 13-stroke major championship standard which had stood for 138 years, established by Old Tom Morris in the 1862 British Open. The record margin for the U.S. Open had been 11 strokes by Willie Smith in 1899. In the Masters, Woods broke the record margin of nine strokes set by Nicklaus in 1965. Tiger won the Open Championship by eight strokes, the largest margin since J. H. Taylor in 1913.
He is the career victories leader among active players on the PGA TOUR, and is the career money list leader. In 2012, he passed Jack Nicklaus for second in PGA TOUR career victories (74), trailing only Sam Snead (82).
Tiger increased his record total on the PGA TOUR career money list to $109,504,139 through 2013, and had won $132,349,133 worldwide.

Woods announced the creation of Tiger Woods Design, a golf-course design company, in 2006 to utilize Tiger's worldwide experience, his limitless pursuit of excellence and his love of golf to create a unique collection of amazing golf courses.
He is the son of Earl Woods, a retired lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army, and his wife, Kultida, a native of Thailand. He was nicknamed Tiger after a Vietnamese soldier and friend of his father, Vuong Dang Phong, to whom his father had also given that nickname.
Born on Dec. 30, 1975, Woods grew up in Cypress, Calif., 35 miles southeast of Los Angeles He was not out of the crib before he took an interest in golf, at age 6 months, watching as his father hit golf balls into a net and imitating his swing. He appeared on the Mike Douglas Show at age 2, putting with Bob Hope. He shot 48 for nine holes at age 3 and was featured in Golf Digest at age 5. He won the Optimist International Junior tournament six times at ages 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
Tiger played in his first professional tournament in 1992, at age 16, at the Nissan Los Angeles Open and in three more PGA TOUR events in 1993. He made the 36-hole cut and tied for 34th place in the 1994 Johnnie Walker Asian Classic in Thailand and had three additional PGA TOUR appearances. He entered Stanford University in 1994 and in two years, he won 10 collegiate events, concluding with the NCAA title. His other amateur victories included the 1994 Western Amateur. He represented the United States in the 1994 World Amateur Team Championships in France and the 1995 Walker Cup Match in Wales.
He played his first major championships in 1995, making the 36-hole cuts in The Masters and the British Open, but had to withdraw from the U.S. Open because of an injured wrist. Tiger also made the cuts in the Motorola Western Open and Scottish Open. He played in three more major championships in 1996, making the cuts in two. After missing the cut in The Masters, he led the U.S. Open after 13 holes of the first round before finishing tied for 82nd place. Tiger posted a 281 total to tie the record for an amateur in the British Open, and his 66 in the second round equaled the lowest ever by an amateur. He tied for 22nd place.
Among the honors received as an amateur, Woods was Golf Digest Player of the Year in 1991 and 1992, Golf World Player of the Year in 1992 and 1993, Golfweek National Amateur of the Year in 1992, Golf World Man of the Year in 1994, and he was chosen for the Fred Haskins and Jack Nicklaus College Player of the Year awards in 1996.
Woods compiled one of the most impressive amateur records in golf history, winning six USGA national championships, plus the NCAA title, before turning professional on Aug. 27, 1996. He concluded his amateur career by winning an unprecedented third consecutive U.S. Amateur title, finishing with a record 18 consecutive match-play victories.
Woods won the U.S. Junior Amateur three times and was the first to win that title more than once. He was the youngest ever to win the U.S. Junior Amateur (age 15 in 1991) and the youngest ever to win the U.S. Amateur (age 18 in 1994). With his U.S. Open victory, Tiger became the first ever to hold that title along with the U.S. Junior Amateur and U.S. Amateur titles.
The week after winning his third U.S. Amateur title, Woods played his first tournament as a professional in the Greater Milwaukee Open. It was one of only seven events left in 1996 for him to finish among the top 125 money winners and earn a player's card for the PGA TOUR.
He won twice and placed among the top 30 money winners qualifying for THE TOUR Championship. He finished 25th with $790,594 and won $940,420 for the year worldwide in 11 tournaments. He was the first rookie since 1990 to win twice and the first player since 1982 to have five consecutive top-five finishes.
Starting 1997 in spectacular fashion, Tiger won the season-opening Mercedes Championships with a birdie in a playoff over Tom Lehman with a six-iron shot that drew perfectly to the flag, landing two feet right of the hole and spinning back to within inches.

He won $2,440,831 worldwide in 25 events.
He achieved No. 1 on the Official World Golf Ranking for the most rapid progression ever to that position. On June 15, 1997, in his 42nd week as a professional, Woods became the youngest-ever No. 1 golfer at age 21 years, 24 weeks. The previous youngest was Bernhard Langer, age 29 years, 31 weeks in 1986.
In 1998, Woods won one event on the PGA TOUR and three times overall. He was fourth on the money list with $1,841,117 and earned $2,927,006 worldwide in 26 events. His most dramatic triumph was over Ernie Els in the Johnnie Walker Classic in Thailand. Tiger rallied with 65 in the final round after starting tied for 18th place, eight strokes behind Els, whom he beat with a birdie on the second playoff hole. He had been 11 strokes behind Els after two rounds.
In his third full season as a professional, 1999, Woods won eight times on the PGA TOUR, including the PGA Championship, and earned $6,616,585. He had a margin of $2,974,679 over runner-up David Duval, a figure greater than the previous single-year PGA TOUR record.
His dominance was such that Woods won 52 percent of all the prize money he could have won. He won 81.7 percent more than the runner-up, the highest margin since Byron Nelson in 1945 (87.2 percent) and Hogan in 1946 (85 percent). He was the first to have as many as eight PGA TOUR victories in one year since Johnny Miller won eight in 1974.
The best previous start on the PGA TOUR was by Horton Smith, who had eight PGA TOUR victories in 1929 at age 21 and 15 career victories in 1931 at age 23. By winning eight PGA TOUR titles and 11 overall in 1999, Woods had posted career totals of 15 PGA TOUR victories and 21 overall at age 23. The comparable figures for Nicklaus, through age 24 in 1964, were 12 PGA TOUR victories and 17 overall. Nicklaus had been a professional golfer for three years, one year less than Tiger.
Tiger won four consecutive PGA TOUR events to end 1999 and started 2000 with two more victories for a total of six in succession. He had to come from behind for the fifth and sixth victories. He played the last three holes in 4-under par at the Mercedes Championships, then defeated Els in a playoff with a 40-foot birdie putt. He trailed Matt Gogel by seven strokes with seven holes left in the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, then played the last four holes in four under par to win by two strokes.
In 2000, Woods matched the record of Hogan in 1953 in winning three professional majors the same year. Hogan won The Masters, U.S. Open and British Open. Tiger also became the first since Denny Shute in 1936-37 to win the PGA Championship in consecutive years.
Woods won 11 tournaments in 2000, nine on the PGA TOUR, one on the PGA European TOUR and the PGA Grand Slam. In addition, Woods and Duval won the World Cup team title for the U.S. He earned $9,188,321 on the PGA TOUR ($11,034,530 worldwide) and broke the TOUR record of $6,616,585, which he set in 1999. His nine PGA TOUR victories in 2000 equaled the fifth highest total ever and were the most since Sam Snead won 11 in 1950.
Woods won five times on the PGA TOUR in 2001 and eight times worldwide. He won five times again on TOUR in 2002, and seven times worldwide, and was the TOUR's leading money winner for the fourth consecutive year with $6,912,625 ($8,417,188 worldwide).
At the conclusion of 2002, Woods' eight professional major championships and three U.S. Amateur titles brought his total to 11 majors through age 26, two more than Nicklaus at that age. Nicklaus had seven professional major victories and two U.S. Amateur titles.
He won a total of 20 times from 2003-06, lead the TOUR's money list twice and capturing four majors (2005 Masters, 2005-06 British Open and 2006 PGA Championship). He began 2007 with his seventh consecutive PGA TOUR victory and ended the year with a total of seven official wins including a second-consecutive PGA Championship, a first-place finish on the TOUR money list, a seventh career Vardon Trophy and a win at the Target World Challenge. In 2008, he won four of six PGA TOUR events including his 14th major at the U.S. Open -- his last event of the year before season-ending knee surgery -- plus the Dubai Desert Classic and finished second on the TOUR money list in just six starts.

Tiger Woods has been learning the game of golf since he was six months old. Check out Kidzworld's biography on golf's greatest player.
Tiger's real first name is Eldrick. He was born on December 30, 1975 and grew up in Cypress, California. A young Tiger began taking an interest in golf when he was just six months old. He would watch his father, Earl, hit golf balls into a net and would try imitating his swing. He was given the nickname Tiger after a Vietnamese soldier and friend of his father, to whom his father had also given that nickname. Tiger Woods appeared on television practicing his swing at the age of two and by the time he was three, he had already shot a 48 on a nine-hole course. When he was just five, the golf world began to take notice of Tiger Woods and he was featured on the cover of Golf Digest.
Tiger Woods was just 16 and still in high school when he played in his first professional golf tournament -  the Nissan Los Angeles Open. Two years later, he went to college at Stanford University where he won ten collegiate events and the NCAA title. While he appeared in only a handful of professional tournaments during his years in college, it wouldn't be long before Tiger Woods would be winning pro events at a ridiculous rate.
Tiger Woods turned pro in the summer of 1996 at the age of 20 and won two tournaments in his first season on the PGA tour. The following year, Tiger Woods won four tournaments and became the youngest golfer to win the Masters. He was also selected as the 1997 PGA Player of the Year. Since turning pro, Tiger Woods has devoured just about every competition he's entered. He's won 71 official PGA Tour events, including four Masters, 4 PGA Championships, three US Opens and three British Opens. He's also won nearly $110 million in prize money and he's still only 33 years old! Tiger Woods lost his number one spot in the world golf rankings in September 2004 and was briefly ranked third in the world behind Ernie Els and V.J. Singh.  But his playoff victory at the 2005 Masters and a convincing victory at the 2005 British Open has placed him firmly on top of the golf world's rankings once again.
 It has been called one of the most anticipated returns on sports history when Tiger returned to the PGA Tour event after and eight month layoff. It was at the WGC-Accenture Match Play where he lost to Tim Clark in the second round.  Then Woods won his 71st carreer title at the BMW Championship. In November 2009, Tiger went on his 38th European Tour win and had his first win of the PGA Tour of Australasia . 
On November 25, 2009, the National Enquirer published a story alleging Tiger Woods had an affair with a night club hostess in New York; the woman in question denies the claims. On November 27 the golfer crashed his Cadillac Escalade into a fire hydrant and a neighbor's tree at 2:25 a.m. and, after his wife, Elin Nordegren, said she used a golf club to smash out the car's windows to get to her husband, was briefly hospitalized. On November 28 Tiger released a statement on his website saying the crash, which left him with cuts and bruises, was his fault. On November 30, Tiger withdrew from the annual Chevron World Challenge golf tournament due to his injuries and said he won't compete again until 2010. On December 1 the Florida Highway Patrol completed its investigation of the crash, deeming it an accident and charging Tiger $164 in fines.
Here's where the story starts to get interesting. On December 2, 2009, Us Weekly magazine published a cover story saying an LA waitress claims she had an almost three-year affair with Tiger Woods - and has proof in 300 text messages and a November 24, 2009 voice mail that she met the top golfer in 2007, just two months before Elin gave birth to the couple's first child. Three hours after the story dropped, Tiger admitted the story is true and apologized in a statement on his website:
“I have not been true to my values and the behaviour my family deserves. I am not without faults and I am far short of perfect. I am dealing with my behaviour and personal failings behind closed doors with my family. Those feelings should be shared by us alone.”
Although he promised to speak publicly in a news conference on December 3 the event was called off just one hour before it was set to start. And on December 8 reports started surfacing that Elin had moved out of the family home. Now, as the days go on, more and more women that say they had affairs with Tiger Woods while he was married seem to be coming out of the woodwork - but how many are telling the truth and how many are just looking for the fortune and fame that may come with being associated with (and bringing down) one of the best athlete's in the world? We'll keep you posted!
On Novemeber 27, 2009, Tiger Woods was taken to hospital after an early morning car accident near his home. Woods was released from the hospital in good condition.
On October 5, 2004, Tiger Woods got married to his long-time girlfriend, Swedish bombshell, Elin Nordegren. The pair tied the knot at a lavish wedding ceremony in Barbados.
Woods has won fourteen professional major  golf championships , the second highest of any male player, and 71 PGA Tour events, third all time.

(born Dec. 30, 1975, Cypress, Calif., U.S.) U.S. golfer. The child of a Thai mother and an African American father, Woods was a golf prodigy and won the first of three consecutive U.S. Junior Amateur Championships (199193) when he was 15 years old. In 1994 at age 18 he became the youngest winner of the U.S. Amateur competition, which he also won in 1995 and 1996. In 1997 Woods at age 21 became the youngest player and the first of African or Asian descent ever to win the Masters Tournament, winning by a record margin of 12 strokes. Winner of five other PGA tournaments in 1997, Woods became the youngest player ever ranked first in world golf competition. On July 23, 2000, Woods became the fifth playerafter Gene Sarazen, Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan, and Gary Playerin golf history, and the youngest, to achieve a career grand slam of the four major championships (the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open, and PGA Championship). In 2005 he completed his second career grand slam.
American athlete Tiger Woods (born 1975) is the youngest man ever, and the first man of color, to win the Masters Tournament of golf.On April 13, 1997, Tiger Woods made golfing history when he won the prestigious Masters tournament of golf. The win was a record breaker in many ways. Woods, at age twenty-one, was the youngest person ever to win the Masters Tournament. He beat the competition with a record-breaking score of 270 for seventy-two holes. He secured the win with a twelve-stroke lead, the largest victory margin in the history of the tournament. Woods, a man of ethnic complexity, further distinguished himself as the first non-white to win the Masters, and in doing so he helped to dissolve many stereotypical notions and attitudes regarding minorities in the sport of golf.Tiger Woods was born Eldrick Woods on December 30, 1975, in Cypress, California. He was the only child of Earl and Kultida Woods. His parents identified their son's talent at an unusually early age. They said that he was playing with a putter before he could walk. The boy was gifted not only with exceptional playing abilities, but he also possessed a passion for the sport itself. Woods first came to notoriety on a syndicated talk show when he beat the famed comedian and avid golfer Bob Hope in a putting contest. The young boy was only three at the time, and he was quickly hailed as a prodigy. Not long after that, when he was five years old, Woods was featured on the popular television magazine That's Incredible!Woods' father has never denied that he devoted his energies to developing his son's talent and to furthering the boy's career as a golfer. During practice sessions, Tiger learned to maintain his composure and to hold his concentration while his father persistently made extremely loud noises and created other distractions. "I was using golf to teach him about life…. About how to handle responsibility and pressure," his father explained to Alex Tresniowski of People.All the while, Tiger's mother made sure that her son's rare talent and his budding golf career would not interfere with his childhood or his future happiness. His mother was a native of Thailand and very familiar with the mystical precepts of Buddhism, and she passed this philosophy on to her son.As Woods' special talents became increasingly evident, his parents stressed personality, kindness, and self-esteem. They impressed upon their son that he was not to throw tantrums or be rude or think of himself as any better than the next person. John McCormick and Sharon Begley of Newsweek said of his parents, "[Tiger Woods is] best-known as perhaps the finest young golfer in history. But to his parents, it's more important that Tiger Woods is a fine young man. It took love, rules, respect, confidence and trust to get there."In many ways Woods grew up as a typical middle-class American boy. He developed a taste for junk food and an affection for playing video games. He also spent a fair share of his time clowning around in front of his father's ever-present video camera. As for playing golf, there is no question that the sport was the focus of his childhood. He spent many hours practicing his swing and playing in youth tournaments. Woods was eight years old when he won his first formal competition. From that point he became virtually unstoppable, amassing trophies and breaking amateur records everywhere. Media accounts of the boy prodigy had reached nearly legendary proportions by 1994, when he entered Stanford University as a freshman on a full golfing scholarship.During his first year of college, Woods won the U.S. Amateur title and qualified to play in the Masters tournament in Augusta, Georgia, in the spring of 1995. Although he played as an amateur-not for prize money-Woods' reputation preceded him. Biographer John Strege wrote about that first Masters tournament in Tiger: A Biography of Tiger Woods, "Golf great Nick Price was there. So were Nick Faldo, John Daly and Fuzzy Zoeller, all of them consigned to relative obscurity on this Monday of Masters week. All eyes were on Woods." By 1996, Woods had won three consecutive U.S. Amateur titles, an unprecedented accomplishment in itself. Woods was only twenty years old, yet there was not much else for him to accomplish as an amateur. He carefully weighed the advantages of finishing college against the prospect of leaving school and entering the sport of professional golf. The temptation to turn professional was enhanced by lucrative offers of endorsement contracts. In August of 1996, Woods decided to quit college in order to play professional golf.Four months later in December, Woods celebrated his twenty-first birthday. He marked the occasion with a legal name change, from Eldrick to Tiger. Woods had been called Tiger by his father even as a youngster. The nickname stuck, and Woods had always been known to his friends, and to the press, as Tiger. It soon became evident that he was destined for success. Sports Illustrated named him 1996 "Sportsman of the Year," and by January of 1997, he had already won three professional tournaments. He was a media sensation.In April of 1997, and only eight months into his professional career, Woods played in the prestigious Masters tournament held at Georgia's Augusta National Golf Club. The Masters title is perhaps the most coveted honor in the world of golf. In addition to a hefty prize purse, first-place winners are awarded a green blazer to symbolize their membership among the most elite golfers in the world. Contestants are typically well into their thirties or even their forties by the time they win the Masters Tournament. That year Woods competed against golfing greats, but managed to best the most seasoned competition.When the tournament was over, Woods had made history as the youngest person ever to win the Masters title. His score was an unprecedented 270 strokes. His victory margin set another record-twelve strokes ahead of the runner-up. This feat was enhanced by the fact that Woods was the first man of color ever to win the title. He accepted all of these honors with grace and humility, and gave tribute to the black golfers who came before him and helped pave the way. He also honored his mother (who is Asian) by reminding the world of his diverse ethnic background; he is African-American, Thai, Chinese, Native American, and Caucasian. He discouraged the press from labeling him exclusively as African American, because it showed complete disregard for his mother's Asian heritage. During an interview for the Oprah Winfrey Show, he reiterated an innovative description that he had coined for himself as a child, "I'm a Cablinasian." He was quoted also by John Feinstein of Newsweek, concerning the issue of race, "I don't consider myself a Great Black Hope. I'm just a golfer who happens to be black and Asian."Less than three months passed until July 6, 1997, when Woods won the Western Open. Critics attributed his astounding success to uncanny persistence and an extraordinary desire to win. "He thinks, therefore he wins," reported the Detroit News, on the day after the Western Open. Woods seemed unstoppable. Some of the greatest golfers in the world offered sportsmanly tribute to the young hero. His enormous popularity and unprecedented success prompted Frank Deford of Newsweek to write, "It's getting so that the only other famous person on the golf circuit is Tiger's caddie … suddenly you understand: there is no second-best golfer in the world…. It is just Tiger Woods." In less than one year as a professional golfer Woods' career winnings totaled over $1,000,000. In addition to prize money earned, he signed multi-million dollar contracts to endorse a variety of products, from sports equipment to investment funds.To many observers, Tiger Woods' rise to fame is tied to issues of race and ethnicity as well as to outstanding athletic performance on the golfing course. "Tiger threatened one of the last bastions of white supremacy," wrote Strege in his biography of Woods. Although accusations of racial discrimination had been leveled against the Professional Golf Association (PGA) for many years, little was done. According to Rick Reilly of Sports Illustrated, the Augusta National Tournament founder, Clifford Roberts, once remarked, "As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black." Policies were slowly changed to ensure that black golfers would be allowed to compete on a par with whites, but the Augusta National Golf Club didn't accept its first African American member until 1990.Woods, with his easy style, his unpretentious disposition, and his powerful 300-yard drives, successfully commanded the respect and attention of golf's predominantly white culture. "Golf has shied away from [racism] for too long," Woods commented to Time. "Some clubs have brought in tokens, but nothing really has changed. I hope what I'm doing can change that." Robert Beck of Sports Illustrated called the ethnically diverse golfer, "A one-man Rainbow Coalition." By all reports, he rises graciously to every occasion, handling the media as well as his peers, with tact and aplomb. Joe Stroud of the Detroit Free Press commented, "He is a photogenic young man…. He is about as remarkable a combination of power and finesse as I've ever seen."Woods is credited too with popularizing the sport of golf, not only among blacks and other minorities, but among children of all backgrounds. Jennifer Mills of Cable-TV explained the depth of the Tiger Woods phenomenon, "He is bringing a whole new set of people to the golf course who have never been here before…. Kids of every race are dying to see him. They look up at what he's doing and for the first time feel, 'Hey, maybe I could do that."' His personal sponsorship of programs for children has been reported for years, and at least one corporate sponsor found that in order to secure an endorsement from Tiger Woods the price would include the added cost of a generous donation to the Tiger Woods Foundation for inner city children. A Time review of the twenty-five most influential people of 1997 reported, "Woods doesn't simply take his money and play. He conducts clinics for inner-city kids, and he … will create opportunities for youngsters who would otherwise never get a chance."Further ReadingStrege, John, Tiger: A Biography of Tiger Woods, Broadway Books, 1997.Christian Science Monitor, December 5, 1996.Detroit Free Press, January 13, 1997; April 14, 1997, p. 1D; April 23, 1997, p. 1D; May 2, 1997, p. 10A; May 7, 1997, p.

Life's WorkTiger Woods is a great athlete, and well on the road to becoming a hero. Before the age of 20, he'd already attracted thousands of worshippers. For example, Sports Illustrated, the American bible of sports coverage rarely reserves ten pages to profile a college kid. But the magazine fairly gushed with reverence over the young golfer in March of 1995, exclaiming, "Only 19, amateur sensation Tiger Woods has the golf world shaking its head in awe." Likewise, Newsweek heralded Woods's prodigious talent, declaring in bold print: "He can hit like [Greg] Norman, putt like [Jack] Nicklaus, and think like a Stanford freshman. He's already the best 19-year-old American golfer ever." According to the Cincinnati Post, on August 27, 1996, he sent a message to the tour officials at the Greater Woods that read, "This is to confirm that, as of now, I am professional golfer." Reasoned The Source, Woods turned pro, "because there were no challenges left for him at the amateur level...."Writers had ample reason to employ so many superlatives. At the age of 15, Woods had become not only the first black man to win the U.S. Junior Amateur Championship, but also its youngest victor. He was also the first male to win three U.S. Junior titles--1991, 1992, 1993--and had enjoyed a few casual rounds with professional golfers Sam Snead, Greg Norman, Jack Nicklaus, and John Daly. Woods's amateur title also qualified him for a trio of prestigious professional events--the Masters, the U.S. Open, and the British Open. Perhaps more importantly, the Stanford freshman captured the latter championship by staging the greatest comeback in a game in the 99-year history of the tournament. It was a dazzling performance that suggested Woods was a champion of the highest order.Tom Watson, a tried and true legend himself, called Woods "the most important young golfer in the last 50 years." Another golfing great, Bryon Nelson, told Newsweek that compared to the youthful games of Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, and Tom Watson, Woods stood alone. "I've seen 'em all," he said, adding, "This fellow has no weakness." Coach Butch Harmon, who tutored Greg Norman and later Woods, declared, "He handles pressure like a 30-year-old. And his creativity is amazing. Some of the shots I've seen him hit remind me of Norman and Arnold Palmer."Despite the outpouring of professional praise, Woods did not abandon his college studies to join the pro tour following his historic win. The New York Times stated that Woods played golf with the "steadfast persistence of a man many years his senior," and the same could be said of his life off the greens. Woods was committed to his studies at Stanford, determined to maintain a 3.0 grade point average and become the top collegiate golfer in the country. Never mind that millions in endorsements and prize money was essentially his for the asking. Woods, and his parents, weren't yet ready to cash in on his talent. "Money can't buy us," Tiger's mother, Kultida (Tida), a native of Thailand, told Rick Reilly of Sports Illustrated. "What [does] he need money for? If you turn him pro, you take his youth away from him."According to Woods, his youth was a normal one. "I did the same things every kid did," he told Newsweek. "I studied and went to the mall. I was addicted to TV wrestling, rap music, and The Simpsons. I got into trouble and got out of it. I loved my parents and obeyed what they told me. The only difference is I can sometimes hit a little ball into a hole in less strokes than some other people." But that was hardly the only difference. Typical childhoods, after all, are not launched on the golf course: Woods was introduced to the game at nine months. By the age of three, he'd already scored 50 for nine holes and outputted Bob Hope on the Mike Douglas Show. Still, if observers needed further proof that Woods was a child prodi gy, they got it when he hit a hole-in-one at the age of six and broke 80 by the age of eight.His extraordinary success, in part, stemmed from early psychological training, including a series of subliminal tapes that Woods began listening to at the age of six. The messages intended to shape an unshakable confidence with declarations like: "I focus and give it my all!," "My will moves mountain!," "I believe in me!," and "I will my own destiny!" As Reilly of Sports Illustrated reported, "From the beginning, the boy understood what the tape was for, and he liked it. He would pop in the tape while swinging in front of the mirror or putting on the carpet or watching videos of old Masters tournaments. In fact, he played the tape so often that it would have driven any other parents quite nuts." Hardly the stuff of a normal childhood.Earl and Kultida Woods were not ordinary parents. Earl, a former Green Beret and U.S. Army officer, discovered golf at the age of 42, after he had served his time in Vietnam and Thailand and met and married Tida, a woman 14 years his junior. A gifted athlete, Earl had competed in collegiate baseball; a catcher, he was the first black player at Kansas State. When Tiger came along, Earl was determined that his son start golf early. Taking him to the Navy Golf Course--just five minutes from their home--Earl put a putter into Tiger's hands before he could walk and taught him the fundamentals of the game before he could barely talk. By the age of two, Tiger could offer rather advanced criticism of other people's swings. By second grade, Woods won his first international tournament. 10-year-old Tiger began taking formal lessons with golf pro legend John Anselmo and would continue to do so until he was 17. At 11, he had played some 30 junior tournaments in Southern California, winning every title.Woods's adeptness was not limited to golf. During his teen years he participated in many sports. Newsweek acknowledged that Woods was "a natural switch-hitter [in baseball], loved playing shooting guard [in basketball], was a wide receiver [in football], and a 400-meter runner [in track]." But golf always seemed to be his main love, so much so that his parents often had to remind or encourage him to do other things. The pleasure he derived from doing so well on the course was always apparent. Even as a pro, Sports Illustrated's Gary Van Sickle noted, "He smiles on the course and looks as if he's having fun. He emotes, whether it's punching the air with an uppercut ... or straight-arming a putt into the hole." And the tougher the challenge, the more Woods enjoyed himself. As Van Sickle remarked, "Woods ... is a dangerous golfer. Difficult situations bring out the best in him."If one single secret to Tiger's early success exists, it was mental toughness. Earl Woods tried to ensure that his son's swing would not unravel during the pressure of competition. When Tiger practiced, Earl made it his mission to drive his son to distraction by jingling change, dropping golf bags, tearing open the Velcro on his glove, anything to unnerve the young golfer. As Reilly reported, "What his dad tried to do, whenever possible, was cheat, distract, harass, and annoy him. You spend 20 years in the military, train with the Green Berets, do two tours of [Viet]Nam and one of Thailand, you learn a few things about psychological warfare." The concentration that the elder Woods had to maintain during combat was passed on to his son for the purpose of winning a golf game rather than a war. "The boy learned coldness, too. Eventually, nothing the father did could make him flinch. The boy who once heard subliminal messages under rippling brooks now couldn't hear a thing," Reilly concluded.Indeed, it was Tiger's ability to focus, his almost otherworldly capacity for concentration and poise, that made all the difference during the 1994 Amateur Championship. When Woods found himself six holes down after 13 holes of the 36-hole final, he began his improbable comeback. Heading into the final nine, he had closed the gap but still held a precarious three-hole deficit. He continued to find his birdies--golf scores of one stroke less than standard on a hole--pulling even with the leader, Trip Kuehne of Oklahoma State, by the 17th hole.It was then that Woods created some magic, hitting a "fearless tee shot," in the words of some spectators, on a par-3. The ball landed on the green, just four paces from the water's edge. "You don't see too many pros hit it right of that pin," Kuehne later recalled for the New York Times. "It was a great gamble that paid off." Woods dropped a 14-foot putt and played steadily on the 18th to become the youngest winner of America's oldest golf championship, as well as the event's first black champion. "When Tiger won his first U.S. Junior [in 1991]," his father told Sports Illustrated, "I said to him, 'Son, you have done something no black person in the United States has ever done, and you will forever be a part of history.' But this is ungodly in its ramifications."It is possible that Tiger Woods and his family did not fully anticipate the implications of his success. For one, African Americans promptly heralded Woods as the next "Great Black Hope." Woods, in turn, sought to distance himself from the people who wanted to pigeonhole him. He did not want to assume the role of a crusader. Again and again he pointed out to the press that he was not only African American but also part Thai, part Chinese, and part Indian. On applications requesting ethnic identity, he described himself as Asian.Tida, in particular, voiced her dismay at the racial stereotyping. "All the media try to put black in him," she told Sports Illustrated. "Why don't they ask who half of Tiger is from? In the United States, one little part black is all black. Nobody wants to listen to me. I been trying to explain to people, but they don't understand. To say he is 100 percent black is to deny his heritage. To deny his grandmother and grandfather. To deny me!" Some writers took offense to the Woods's racial stance. Jet magazine, for example, subtly voiced this retort: "Woods's description of his racial identity led one observer to wonder how he could say he is only 25 percent black, when his father is black." The public exchange was an early sign that Woods's fame was going to force him to confront issues of race.Other pitfalls emerged in the wake of Woods's great feat. As coach Harmon confessed to Reilly of Sports Illustrated, "This young man is one of the best young players to come out of this country in a long, long time. That is the good news. The bad news is that he has to live up to it now." The question on most everyone's mind was, would Tiger succeed as a professional? It seemed unlikely that the young star would pass up so many millions to be made off his sport, "especially now," as Sports Illustrated noted, "that he has been stamped with the undeniable look of a future superstar." So eager were companies to own a piece of Woods that they called Stanford trying to negotiate deals to start lines of Tiger Woods sporting apparel and Tiger Woods clubs. "Nobody believes," Newsweek suggested, "Woods will live up to his avowed goal of staying at Stanford for four years, passing up the tour and the hundreds of millions of dollars awaiting him in the endorsement villa ge."Still, heading into his sophomore year, Woods remained an amateur. Tida, for one, was determined that her son earn a degree. No amount of money, in her eyes, could replace the value of a good education. Earl was inclined to leave his son's future open to other possibilities. If Tiger completely dominated college golf during his sophomore and junior years, he told Sports Illustrated, then perhaps his son would joined the tour, juggling tournaments around his Stanford schedule. For all the promise of glamour and gold, the family's decision to invest in education was a prudent one. As the New York Times pointed out, "Winners of the U.S. Amateur do not necessarily go on to become great golfers--the roll call of amateur champions who had marginal careers is a lengthy one."Speculation about the future of Tiger Woods ended, however, in the late summer of 1996, when the 20-year-old, joined the professional ranks. He quickly won two of his first seven Professional Golf Association (PGA) starts, which Newsweek cheekily noted was "the most successful professional golf debut since dimples on the ball." In just seven weeks, he went from his debut at the Greater Milwaukee Open, where he finished in 60th place, to coming "within range of his stated goal of making the top 125 on the money list and earning a PGA Tour exemption [meaning he would not have to play in the 1997 PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament]," according to Gary Van Sickle in Sports Illustrated. Van Sickle further asserted that "By winning in [the] Las Vegas [Invitational], in only his fifth start as a pro, Tiger Woods proved beyond a doubt that his time had come."Though some felt his initial pro games were shaky--for example, in his third professional event, the Quad City Classic, he blew the lead in the final round--Woods steadily improved. And, as Reilly assessed, Woods was "making history almost daily." Having found his rhythm, Woods was the picture of confidence, telling Reilly, "I really haven't [even] played my best golf yet." Woods was scoring off the field as well having signed $60 million in endorsements with Nike and Titleist. Still, PGA Tour veteran and friend Davis Love III cautioned to Van Sickle, "He's not playing for the money. He's trying to win. He thinks about winning and nothing else."Despite being driven, Love's comment was not exactly true, however. Like many young adults, Woods anticipated the many rites of passage. The same article mentioned that Woods, "was looking forward to returning to Las Vegas in a year, when he'll be 21. 'I'll be legal,' Woods said, smiling. I can actually do some stuff around here." Though he feels he had a "normal" childhood, Woods has worked harder than most of his peers in order to accomplish all that he has. "You guys don't understand," he chastised Reilly. "When I played in those [early] tournaments, I was either in high school or college. I'd get dumped into the toughest places to play, and I usually was trying to study, get papers done and everything else."In 1997 Woods proved again he was capable of doing anything he set out to do. At 21, he became the youngest player and first African American to win the Masters. This important win had many repercussions, both positive and negative. Golfer Ron Townsend, the first African-American member of the Augusta National told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, "What [Woods is] doing is great for America and great for golf. He's just an amazing talent, and it's pleasure to watch him play."But one incident threatened to tarnish Wood's star. At the ceremony, while Woods accepted his green jacket and trophy, one of the other golfers, Fuzzy Zoeller, made a tasteless joke that many thought was racist. Woods brushed it off and Zoeller apologized.Since winning the Masters, Woods has become Mr. Golf. Swarms of people followed him all over the golf courses watching his every move. Instead of quietly following the sport, many of the "new" crowd behaved as if it were a contact sport, not one of subdued concentration. Every time Woods played, ratings went up and when he won, they were astronomical. "He has changed the way the public looks at golf. Tiger has become one of the most prominent worldwide personalities in current times," former CBS Sports president Neal Pilson told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. His face has been on the box of Wheaties and promptly turned into a collector's item. Woods has been compared to golf great Jack Nicklaus and basketball legend Michael Jordan.Both Woods' winnings and endorsement deals, with Nike and Buick among others, has made him one of the highest paid athletes. He was ranked number two in Forbes magazine. He has been the subject of many books, including his own, How I Play Golf, published in October of 2001. His father has also been published, his tome aptly titled, Training A Tiger: A Father's Account of How to Raise a Winner in Both Golf and Life. Woods has also been the topic of sports videos and he has his own video games.In six years, Woods has 29 PGA Tour victories. He has won six majors, including the PGA Championship and U.S. Open. He even did a Grand Slam, by winning four majors consecutively. According to the Cincinnati Post, he played 52 consecutive rounds at par or better. During the 2000 season, Woods played under par at every tournament. He has even shattered or matched many records. He told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, " My goal is to obviously be the best. It's a lofty goal, and if I do, great. If I don't, at least I tried." His father told the Cincinnati Post, "He finally reached maturity last year. Now, he's trying to bring under control the resources that he has."In 2001 Wood's golf game, according to many, was below average. Many blamed everything from his swing to injury to Woods suffering from burnout. Some have even blamed love. According to Sports Illustrated, rumors floated that he was infatuated with a well-known volleyball star and model. But Woods shrugged it off. He told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, "That's golf. It's part of playing sports. You can't play well all of the time. You can't have everything go your way ..."Though his play may have been off the first half of the year, Woods rallied back and won his second Masters. "This is really special. When I won [the Masters] in '97, I hadn't been pro a full year yet. I was a little young, a little naive. I didn't appreciate what I had done. I have a much better appreciation for major championships now," he was quoted as saying in Jet.After continuing to serve as golf's public face, win major tournaments in the late 1990s through 2002, and doing well on the tour in general, Woods' dominance eased in 2003 and 2004. Woods won two majors in 2002, the Masters and the U.S. Open, as well as three other events, but also had surgery in December to remove fluid from his knee. After recovering and returning to the PGA Tour, Woods again won five tournaments, including the American Express Championship, in 2003, but no majors. He did not even finish in the top ten at the Masters or U.S. Open. Observers believe Woods was having problems with his game, especially accuracy off the tee, and it suffered in part because of a break with coach Harmon.Woods struggled on a greater scale in 2004, having problems with his putting and swing for much of the year. After an early victory at the Match Play Championship, he did not do well in most stroke play tournaments for much of the year. Woods continued to not play well at the majors, finishing 22nd at the Masters. Critics were quick to blame his father's poor health and his impending nuptials to Swedish nanny/model Elin Nordegren for Woods' poor golf game. Despite the distractions, Woods finished the year with two victories at Japan's Dunlop Phoenix and the Target World Challenge, and finished second at PGA Tour Championship. He still managed to finish the year ranked second in the world, after Vijay Singh. In keeping with his goal to start a family, he married Nordegren in October 2004.One reason for Woods' renewal at the end of 2004 was the help of a new coach, Hank Hanley. The pair developed an improved swing that Woods had confidence in. Woods hoped that 2005 would mark his roaring return to dominance of men's professonal golf. He began the year by finishing second at the Mercedes Championship.Woods won six major tournaments that year, notably the British Open and the Masters. He won the points-based PGA Player of the Year Award for the seventh time in nine years. He told Gary Van Sickle in Sports Illustrated that despite his success, he continually looked for ways to improve his game: "The drive is always to get better. You can always get better, no matter what."To help keep himself grounded, Woods relies on "The Brothers"--basketball players, Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley and former football player and sportscaster Ahmad Rashad. These three have been mentoring Woods since he met Jordan after winning the 1997 Masters. The four keep in constant contact and have given or asked for advice from one another. Though he raised him to be a formidable force and taught him all the fundamentals of golf and helped him keep his focus, Earl Woods gave control of his golf career to Woods when the elder Woods became seriously ill with cancer in the late 1990s. His father remained in charge of the Tiger Woods Foundation and Tiger Woods Inc. He also occasionally attended tournaments when his health allowed, but often watched his son's victories on TV.Perhaps most inspiring about Woods' accomplishments as such a young man is that he has literally, and single-handedly, transformed the image of the game, making it more attractive to a wider spectrum of people while glamorizing it. "Tiger Woods is the biggest draw of any athlete on television these days," ABC Sports president Howard Katz exclaimed to the Dallas Morning News. As Reilly pointed out, "Golf used to be four white guys sitting around a pinochle table talking about their shaft flexes... . Now golf is [supermodel] Cindy Crawford sending Woods a letter." Indeed, Woods's presence has attracted a multitude of new fans to the sport of golf--minorities and young people among them. Van Sickle reiterated Jack Nicklaus's belief that "someone would come along who could hit 30 yards past everyone else, much as he did decades ago, have a great short game, and dominate the sport." In so many ways, Woods already has. Though golf is and will be an integral part of his life for many years to come, as he has matured, he has come to appreciate his victories and his life outside of golf. He commented to Sports Illustrated, "No doubt about it, I have a wonderful balance in my life. I've learned what's best for me."

Happy 30th birthday to Tiger Woods.  The champion golfer won his first Masters in 1997, when he was 21, the youngest winner ever.  In 2001, he became one of an elite group of golfers to simultaneously hold the four major tournament titles:  US Open, British Open, PGA Championship and Masters.  By 2005 he had nine major golf championships under his belt.  Woods is the only person to be twice named Sports Illustrated magazine's Sportsman of the Year, in 1996 and 2000.  Woods' real first name is Eldrick; when he was very young, his father nicknamed him Tiger in honor of his friend, a South Vietnamese army officer.
Woods, Tiger (Eldrick Woods), 1975-, American golfer, b. Cypress, Calif. The son of a African-American father and a Thai mother, he was a college star at Stanford and became the only three-time (1994-96) U.S. amateur champion before turning professional in 1997. Seeming to justify publicity promoting him as the "future of golf," Woods won the 1997 Masters in a runaway. After mixed success in 1998, he won the Professional Golfers Association (PGA) Championship and again dominated golf in 1999. In 2000, Woods won the U.S. and British opens and PGA Championship, setting or tying several records in the process and becoming the youngest of only five golfers to achieve a career Grand Slam. Woods's victory at the Masters in 2001 made him the first golfer to win all four major professional championships in a row. He has since won the Masters (2002, 2005), U.S. Open (2002, 2008), British Open (2005-6), and PGA Championship (2006-7) twice, and achieved more than 50 tournament victories by age 30, a PGA record. In 2007 he won the inaugural FedEx Cup, a four-tournament championship. Lurid revelations of marital infidelities in 2009 tarnished his personal reputation.
Popular name of Eldrick Woods, a golfer who in 1997 set three Masters tournament records: he won by the fewest strokes ever (18-under-par 270 for four rounds), beat the runner-up by twelve strokes, and became at twenty-one the youngest man ever to win. He then went on to win many other titles in a sport traditionally dominated by whites.
It has been suggested that Tiger Woods Foundation and Tiger Woods Learning Center be merged into this article or section. (Discuss) Proposed since November 2012. 
Eldrick Tont "Tiger" Woods (born December 30, 1975)[4][5] is an American professional golfer whose achievements to date rank him among the most successful golfers of all time. Formerly the World No. 1, he was the highest-paid athlete in the world according to Forbes for several years.
Woods turned professional in 1996, and by April 1997 he had already won his first major, the 1997 Masters in a record-breaking performance. He first reached the number one position in the world rankings in June 1997. Through the 2000s, Woods was the dominant force in golf, spending 264 weeks from August 1999 to September 2004 and 281 weeks from June 2005 to October 2010 as world number one. From December 2009 to early April 2010, Woods took leave from professional golf to focus on his marriage after he admitted infidelity. His multiple infidelities were revealed by several different women, through many worldwide media sources.[6] This was followed by a loss of form, and his ranking gradually fell to a low of No. 58 in November 2011.[7][8] He snapped a career-long winless streak of 107 weeks when he captured the Chevron World Challenge in December 2011.[8] As of February 3, 2013, he is ranked No. 2, after winning the Farmers Insurance Open for the 7th time.
Woods has broken numerous golf records. He has been world number one for the most consecutive weeks and for the greatest total number of weeks of any other golfer. He has been awarded PGA Player of the Year a record ten times,[9] the Byron Nelson Award for lowest adjusted scoring average a record eight times, and has the record of leading the money list in nine different seasons. He has won 14 professional major golf championships, the second highest of any player (Jack Nicklaus leads with 18), and 76 PGA Tour events, 2nd all time behind Sam Snead.[10] He has more career major wins and career PGA Tour wins than any other active golfer. He is the youngest player to achieve the career Grand Slam, and the youngest and fastest to win 50 tournaments on tour. Additionally, Woods is only the second golfer, after Jack Nicklaus, to have achieved a career Grand Slam three times. Woods has won 17 World Golf Championships, and won at least one of those events in each of the first 11 years after they began in 1999.
Woods was born in Cypress, California, to Earl (1932–2006) and Kultida (Tida) Woods (born 1944). He is the only child of their marriage, but does have two half-brothers, Earl Jr. (born 1955) and Kevin (born 1957), and a half-sister, Royce (born 1958) from the 18-year marriage of Earl Woods and his first wife, Barbara Woods Gray.[11] Earl, a retired lieutenant colonel and Vietnam War veteran, was of African American, Native American, and possibly Chinese ancestry.[12] Kultida (née Punsawad), originally from Thailand (where Earl had met her on a tour of duty in 1968), is of mixed Thai, Chinese, and Dutch ancestry.[13] He refers to his ethnic make-up as "Cablinasian" (a syllabic abbreviation he coined from Caucasian, Black, American Indian, and Asian).[14]
Woods' first name, Eldrick, was coined by his mother because it began with "E" (for Earl) and ended with "K" (for Kultida). His middle name Tont is a traditional Thai name. He was nicknamed Tiger in honor of his father's friend Col. Vuong Dang Phong, who had also been known as Tiger.[15]
Woods has a niece, Cheyenne Woods, who played for Wake Forest University's golf team and turned professional in 2012, making her pro debut in the LPGA Championship.[16]

Woods grew up in Orange County, California. He was a child prodigy, introduced to golf before the age of two, by his athletic father Earl, a single-figure handicap amateur golfer who had been one of the earliest African-American college baseball players at Kansas State University.[17] In 1978, Tiger putted against comedian Bob Hope in a television appearance on The Mike Douglas Show. At age three, he shot a 48 over nine holes over the Cypress Navy course, and at age five, he appeared in Golf Digest and on ABC's That's Incredible.[18] Before turning seven, Tiger won the Under Age 10 section of the Drive, Pitch, and Putt competition, held at the Navy Golf Course in Cypress, California.[19] In 1984 at the age of eight, he won the 9–10 boys' event, the youngest age group available, at the Junior World Golf Championships.[20] He first broke 80 at age eight.[21] He went on to win the Junior World Championships six times, including four consecutive wins from 1988 to 1991.[22][23][24][25][26]
Woods' father Earl wrote that Tiger first beat him when he was 11 years old, with Earl trying his best. Earl lost to Tiger every time from then on.[27][28] Woods first broke 70 on a regulation golf course at age 12.[29]
Woods' first major national junior tournament was the 1989 Big I, when he was 13 years old. Woods was paired with pro John Daly, then relatively unknown, in the final round; the event's format placed a professional with each group of juniors who had qualified. Daly birdied three of the last four holes to beat Woods by only one stroke.[30] As a young teenager, Woods first met Jack Nicklaus in Los Angeles at the Bel-Air Country Club, when Nicklaus was performing a clinic for the club's members. Woods was part of the show, and impressed Nicklaus and the crowd with his skills and potential.[31] Earl Woods had researched in detail the career accomplishments of Nicklaus, and had set his young son the goals of breaking those records.[29]
While attending Western High School in Anaheim at the age of 15, Woods became the youngest ever U.S. Junior Amateur champion (a record which stood until it was broken by Jin Liu in 2010).[32] He was named 1991's Southern California Amateur Player of the Year (for the second consecutive year) and Golf Digest Junior Amateur Player of the Year. In 1992, he defended his title at the U.S. Junior Amateur Championship, becoming the first multiple winner; competed in his first PGA Tour event, the Nissan Los Angeles Open (he missed the 36-hole cut); and was named Golf Digest Amateur Player of the Year, Golf World Player of the Year, and Golfweek National Amateur of the Year.[33][34]
The following year, Woods won his third consecutive U.S. Junior Amateur Championship; he remains the event's only three-time winner.[35] In 1994, at the TPC at Sawgrass in Florida, he became the youngest-ever winner of the U.S. Amateur Championship, a record that stood until 2008 when it was broken by Danny Lee.[36] He was a member of the American team at the 1994 Eisenhower Trophy World Amateur Golf Team Championships (winning), and the 1995 Walker Cup (losing).[37][38]
Woods graduated from Western High School in 1994 at age 18, and was voted "Most Likely to Succeed" among the graduating class. He had starred for the high school's golf team under coach Don Crosby.[39]
Woods was recruited very heavily by college golf powers, and chose Stanford University, the 1994 NCAA Division I champion. He enrolled at Stanford in the fall of 1994 under a golf scholarship, winning his first collegiate event, the 40th Annual William H. Tucker Invitational, that September.[40] He declared a major in economics, and was nicknamed "Urkel" by college teammate Notah Begay III.[41] In 1995, he successfully defended his U.S. Amateur title at the Newport Country Club in Rhode Island[36] and was voted Pac-10 Player of the Year, NCAA First Team All-American, and Stanford's Male Freshman of the Year (an award that encompasses all sports).[42][43] He participated in his first PGA Tour major, the 1995 Masters Tournament, and tied for 41st as the only amateur to make the cut. At age 20 in 1996, he became the first golfer to win three consecutive U.S. Amateur titles[44] and won the NCAA individual golf championship.[45] In winning the Silver Medal as leading amateur at The Open Championship, he tied the record for an amateur aggregate score of 281.[46] He left college after two years and turned professional. In 1996, Woods moved out of California, stating in 2013 that it was due to the state's tax rate.[47][48][49]
Woods became a professional golfer in August 1996, and immediately signed deals with Nike, Inc. and Titleist that ranked as the most lucrative endorsement contracts in golf history at that time.[50][51] Woods was named Sports Illustrated's 1996 Sportsman of the Year and PGA Tour Rookie of the Year.[52] In April 1997, he won his first major, the Masters, becoming the tournament's youngest-ever winner.[53] Two months later, he set the record for the fastest-ever ascent to No. 1 in the Official World Golf Rankings.[54] After a lackluster 1998, Woods finished the 1999 season with eight wins, including the PGA Championship, a feat not achieved since 1974.[55][56]
In 2000, Woods achieved six consecutive wins, the longest winning streak since 1948. One of these was the 2000 U.S. Open, where he broke or tied nine tournament records in what Sports Illustrated called "the greatest performance in golf history."[57] At age 24, he became the youngest golfer to achieve the Career Grand Slam.[58] At the end of 2000, Woods had won nine of the twenty PGA Tour events he entered and had broken the record for lowest scoring average in tour history. He was named the Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, the only athlete to be honored twice, and was ranked by Golf Digest magazine as the twelfth-best golfer of all time.[59][60]
Woods' victory in the 2001 Masters Tournament made him the first player to hold all four major professional golf titles at the same time.[61] Following a stellar 2001 and 2002 in which Woods continued to dominate the tour, Woods' career hit a "slump".[55][62] He did not win a major in 2003 or 2004. In September 2004, Vijay Singh overtook Woods in the Official World Golf Rankings, breaking Woods' record streak of 264 weeks at #1.[63]
Woods rebounded in 2005, winning six official PGA Tour money events and reclaiming the top spot in July after swapping it back and forth with Singh over the first half of the year.[64]
In 2006, Woods began dominantly, winning his first two PGA tournaments but failing to capture his fifth Masters championship in April.[65][66] Following the death of his father in May, Woods took a nine-week hiatus from the tour and appeared rusty upon his return at the U.S. Open, missing the cut at Winged Foot.[67] However, he quickly returned to form and ended the year by winning six consecutive tour events. At the season's close, with 54 wins and 12 majors wins, Woods had broken the tour records for both total wins and total majors wins over eleven seasons.[68]
Woods continued to excel in 2007 and the first part of 2008. In April 2008, he underwent knee surgery and missed the next two months on the tour.[69] Woods returned for the 2008 U.S. Open, where he struggled the first day but ultimately claimed a dramatic victory over Rocco Mediate, after which Mediate said, "This guy does things that are just not normal by any stretch of the imagination," and Kenny Perry added, "He beat everybody on one leg."[70][71][72] Two days later, Woods announced that he would miss the remainder of the season due to further knee surgery, and that his knee was more severely damaged than previously revealed, prompting even greater praise for his U.S. Open performance. Woods called it "my greatest ever championship."[73][74][75] In Woods' absence, TV ratings for the remainder of the season suffered a huge decline from 2007.[76]
Upon Woods' much-anticipated return in 2009, he performed well, including a spectacular performance at the 2009 Presidents Cup, but failed to win a major, the first year since 2004 that he had not done so.[77][78][79] After his marital infidelities came to light at the end of 2009 and received massive media coverage, Woods announced in December that he would be taking an indefinite break from competitive golf. In February 2010, he delivered a televised apology for his behavior. During this period, several companies ended their endorsement deals with Woods.
Woods returned to competition in April at the 2010 Masters Tournament, where he finished in a tie for fourth place.[80] He followed the Masters with poor showings at the Quail Hollow Championship and the Players Championship, where he withdrew in the fourth round citing injury.[81] Shortly afterward, Woods' coach since 2003, Hank Haney, resigned the position; he was replaced in August by Sean Foley. The rest of the season went badly for Woods, who failed to win a single event for the first time since turning professional, while nevertheless finishing the season ranked No. 2 in the world.
Woods' performance continued to suffer in 2011, taking its toll on his ranking. After falling to No. 7 in March, he rebounded to No. 5 with a strong showing at the 2011 Masters Tournament, where he tied for fourth place.[82][83][84] Due to leg injuries incurred at the Masters, he missed several summer events; in July he fired his longtime caddy Steve Williams, replacing him temporarily with friend Bryon Bell.[85][86] After returning to tournament play in August, Woods continued to falter, and his ranking gradually fell to a low of #58.[8] He rose to No. 50 in mid-November after a third-place win at the Emirates Australian Open, and broke his winless streak with a victory at December's Chevron World Challenge.[8][87]
Woods began his 2012 season with two tournaments (the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship and the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am) where he started off well, but struggled on the final rounds. Following the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, where he was knocked out in the second round by missing a 5-foot putt,[88] Woods revised his putting technique and tied for second at the Honda Classic, with the lowest final round score in his PGA Tour career. After a short time off due to another leg injury, Woods won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, his first win on the PGA Tour since the BMW Championship in September 2009. Following several dismal performances, Woods notched his 73rd PGA Tour win at the Memorial Tournament in June, tying Jack Nicklaus' record for most PGA Tour victories;[89] a month later, Woods surpassed Nicklaus' record with a win at the AT&T National.[90]
On August 20, 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver announced that Woods would be inducted into the California Hall of Fame. He was inducted December 5, 2007 at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts in Sacramento.[91][92]
He has been named "Athlete of the Decade" by the Associated Press in December 2009.[93] He has been named Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year a record-tying four times, and is the only person to be named Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year more than once.
Since his record-breaking win at the 1997 Masters Tournament, golf's increased popularity is commonly attributed to Woods' presence. He is credited by some sources for dramatically increasing prize money in golf, generating interest in new audiences, and for drawing the largest TV audiences in golf history.[52][94][95][96][97][98]
Woods has been called the world's most marketable athlete.[99] Shortly after his 21st birthday in 1996, he began signing endorsement deals with numerous companies, including General Motors, Titleist, General Mills, American Express, Accenture, and Nike, Inc. In 2000, he signed a 5-year, $105 million contract extension with Nike. It was the largest endorsing deal ever signed by an athlete at that time.[100] Woods' endorsement has been credited with playing a significant role in taking the Nike Golf brand from a "start-up" golf company earlier in the past decade, to becoming the leading golf apparel company in the world, and a major player in the equipment and golf ball market.[99][101] Nike Golf is one of the fastest growing brands in the sport, with an estimated $600 million in sales.[102] Woods has been described as the "ultimate endorser" for Nike Golf,[102] frequently seen wearing Nike gear during tournaments, and even in advertisements for other products.[100] Woods receives a percentage from the sales of Nike Golf apparel, footwear, golf equipment, golf balls,[99] and has a building named after him at Nike's headquarters campus in Beaverton, Oregon.[103]

In 2002, Woods was involved in every aspect of the launch of Buick's Rendezvous SUV. A company spokesman stated that Buick was happy with the value of Woods' endorsement, pointing out that more than 130,000 Rendezvous vehicles were sold in 2002 and 2003. "That exceeded our forecasts," he was quoted as saying, "It has to be in recognition of Tiger." In February 2004, Buick renewed Woods' endorsement contract for another five years, in a deal reportedly worth $40 million.[100]
Woods collaborated closely with TAG Heuer to develop the world's first professional golf watch, released in April 2005.[104] The lightweight, titanium-construction watch, designed to be worn while playing the game, incorporates numerous innovative design features to accommodate golf play. It is capable of absorbing up to 5,000 Gs of shock, far in excess of the forces generated by a normal golf swing.[104] In 2006, the TAG Heuer Professional Golf Watch won the prestigious iF product design award in the Leisure/Lifestyle category.[105]
Woods also endorses the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series of video games; he has done so since 1999.[106] In 2006, he signed a six-year contract with Electronic Arts, the series' publisher.[107]
In February 2007, along with Roger Federer and Thierry Henry, Woods became an ambassador for the "Gillette Champions" marketing campaign. Gillette did not disclose financial terms, though an expert estimated the deal could total between $10 million and $20 million.[108]
In October 2007, Gatorade announced that Woods would have his own brand of sports drink starting in March 2008. "Gatorade Tiger" was his first U.S. deal with a beverage company and his first licensing agreement. Although no figures were officially disclosed, Golfweek magazine reported that it was for five years and could pay him as much as $100 million.[109] The company decided in early fall 2009 to discontinue the drink due to weak sales.[110]
According to Golf Digest, Woods made $769,440,709 from 1996 to 2007,[111] and the magazine predicted that by 2010, Woods would pass one billion dollars in earnings.[112] In 2009, Forbes confirmed that Woods was indeed the world's first athlete to earn over a billion dollars in his career (before taxes), after accounting for the $10 million bonus Woods received for the FedEx Cup title.[113][114] The same year, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $600 million, making him the second richest "African American" behind only Oprah Winfrey.[115]
In July 2011, Woods appeared on a 15-second Japanese television commercial, endorsing a heat back rub by Kowa Co., the Vantelin Kowa rub. Details of the deal, which was made in late 2010, were not disclosed.[116]
In October 2012, it was announced that Woods had signed an exclusive endorsement deal with Fuse Science, Inc, a sports nutrition firm.[117]
Early in Woods' career, a small number of golf experts expressed concern about his impact on the competitiveness of the game and the public appeal of professional golf. Sportswriter Bill Lyon of Knight-Ridder asked in a column, "Isn't Tiger Woods actually bad for golf?" (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he was not).[118] At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week.
A related effect was measured by economist Jennifer Brown of the University of California, Berkeley who found that other golfers played worse when competing against Woods than when he was not in the tournament. The scores of highly skilled (exempt) golfers are nearly one stroke higher when playing against Woods. This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in 2003–04. Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when facing a "superstar" competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort.[119]
Many courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including Major Championship sites like Augusta National) have added yardage to their tees in an effort to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods, a strategy that became known as "Tiger-Proofing". Woods said he welcomed the change, in that adding yardage to courses did not affect his ability to win.[120]
When Woods first joined the professional tour in 1996, his long drives had a large impact on the world of golf.[121][122] However, when he did not upgrade his equipment in the following years (insisting upon the use of True Temper Dynamic Gold steel-shafted clubs and smaller steel clubheads that promoted accuracy over distance),[123] many opponents caught up to him. Phil Mickelson even made a joke in 2003 about Woods using "inferior equipment", which did not sit well with Nike, Titleist or Woods.[124][125] During 2004, Woods finally upgraded his driver technology to a larger clubhead and graphite shaft, which, coupled with his clubhead speed, made him one of the Tour's lengthier players off the tee once again.
Despite his power advantage, Woods has always focused on developing an excellent all-around game. Although in recent years he has typically been near the bottom of the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for putting in more hours of practice than most.[126][127][128]
From mid-1993, while he was still an amateur, until 2004, Woods worked almost exclusively with leading swing coach Butch Harmon. From mid-1997, Harmon and Woods fashioned a major redevelopment of Woods' full swing, achieving greater consistency, better distance control, and better kinesiology. The changes began to pay off in 1999.[129] From March 2004 to 2010, Woods was coached by Hank Haney, who worked on flattening his swing plane. Woods continued to win tournaments with Haney, but his driving accuracy dropped significantly. Haney resigned in May 2010 and was replaced by Sean Foley. [130]
Mike "Fluff" Cowan served as Woods' caddy from the start of his professional career until March 1999.[131] He was replaced by Steve Williams, who became a close friend of Woods and is often credited with helping him with key shots and putts.[132] In June 2011, Woods fired Williams and replaced him with Woods' friend Bryon Bell, on an interim basis. Joe LaCava, a former caddy of both Fred Couples and Dustin Johnson, was hired by Woods shortly after.[133]

Woods has won 76 official PGA Tour events including 14 majors. He is 14–1 when going into the final round of a major with at least a share of the lead. He has been heralded as "the greatest closer in history" by multiple golf experts.[139][140][141] He owns the lowest career scoring average and the most career earnings of any player in PGA Tour history.
He has spent the most consecutive and cumulative weeks atop the world rankings. He is one of five players (along with Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, and Jack Nicklaus) to have won all four professional major championships in his career, known as the Career Grand Slam, and was the youngest to do so.[142] Woods is the only player to have won all four professional major championships in a row, accomplishing the feat in the 2000–2001 seasons.
The Tiger Woods Foundation was established in 1996 by Woods and his father Earl, with the primary goal of promoting golf among inner-city children.[143][144] The foundation has conducted junior golf clinics across the country, and sponsors the Tiger Woods Foundation National Junior Golf Team in the Junior World Golf Championships.[145][146] As of December 2010, TWF employed approximately 55 people.[147][148]
The foundation operates the Tiger Woods Learning Center, a $50 million, 35,000-square-foot facility in Anaheim, California, providing college-access programs for underserved youth.[145][147][149] The TWLC opened in 2006 and features seven classrooms, extensive multi-media facilities and an outdoor golf teaching area.[145] The center has since expanded to four additional campuses: two in Washington, DC; one in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and one in Stuart, Florida.[149]
The foundation benefits from the annual Chevron World Challenge and AT&T National golf tournaments hosted by Woods.[147] In October 2011, the foundation hosted the first Tiger Woods Invitational at Pebble Beach.[150] Other annual fundraisers have included the concert events Block Party, last held in 2009 in Anaheim, and Tiger Jam, last held in 2011 in Las Vegas after a one-year hiatus.[147][151][152][153]
In November 2006, Woods announced his intention to begin designing golf courses around the world through a new company, Tiger Woods Design.[154] A month later, he announced that the company's first course would be in Dubai as part of a 25.3 million-square-foot development, The Tiger Woods Dubai.[155] The Al Ruwaya Golf Course was initially expected to finish construction in 2009.[155] As of February 2010, only seven holes had been completed; in April 2011, the New York Times reported that the project had been shelved permanently.[156][157]
Tiger Woods Design has taken on two other courses, neither of which has materialized. In August 2007, Woods announced The Cliffs at High Carolina, a private course in the Blue Ridge Mountains near Asheville, North Carolina.[158] After a groundbreaking in November 2008, the project suffered cash flow problems and suspended construction.[157] A third course, in Punta Brava, Mexico, was announced in October 2008, but incurred delays due to issues with permits and an environmental impact study.[157][159] Construction on the Punta Brava course has not yet begun.[157]
The problems encountered by these projects have been credited to factors including overly optimistic estimates of their value; declines throughout the global economy, particularly the U.S. crash in home prices; and decreased appeal of Woods following his 2009 infidelity scandal.[157]
Woods wrote a golf instruction column for Golf Digest magazine from 1997 to February 2011.[160] In 2001 he wrote a best-selling golf instruction book, How I Play Golf, which had the largest print run of any golf book for its first edition, 1.5 million copies.[161]
In November 2003, Woods became engaged to Elin Nordegren, a Swedish former model and daughter of former minister of migration Barbro Holmberg and radio journalist Thomas Nordegren.[162] They were introduced during The Open Championship in 2001 by Swedish golfer Jesper Parnevik, who had employed her as an au pair. They married on October 5, 2004, at the Sandy Lane resort in Barbados, and lived at Isleworth, a community in Windermere, a suburb of Orlando, Florida.[163][164] In 2006, they purchased a $39 million estate in Jupiter Island, Florida, and began constructing a 10,000-square-foot home; Woods moved there in 2010 following the couple's divorce.[164][165]
Woods and Nordegren's first child, a daughter named Sam Alexis Woods, was born on June 18, 2007. Woods chose the name because his own father had always called him Sam.[166] Their son, Charlie Axel Woods, was born on February 8, 2009.[167]
On November 25, 2009, supermarket tabloid The National Enquirer published a story claiming that Woods had an extramarital affair with New York City nightclub manager Rachel Uchitel, a claim she denied.[168] Two days later, around 2:30 a.m. on November 27, Woods left home in his Cadillac Escalade SUV and, while still on his street, collided with a fire hydrant, a tree, and several hedges.[169] He was treated for minor facial lacerations and received a ticket for careless driving.[169][170] Following intense media speculation about the accident, Woods released a statement on his website taking sole responsibility for the accident, calling it a "private matter" and crediting his wife for helping him from the car.[171][172] On November 30, Woods announced that he would not be appearing at his own charity golf tournament, the Chevron World Challenge, nor any other tournaments in 2009, due to his injuries.[173]
On December 2, following the release by US Weekly of a voicemail message allegedly left by Tiger for a mistress, Woods released another statement in which he admitted "transgressions" and apologized to "all of those who have supported [him] over the years", while reiterating his and his family's right to privacy.[168][174] Over the next several days, more than a dozen women claimed in various media outlets to have had affairs with Woods.[6] On December 11, he released a third statement admitting to infidelity and apologizing again, as well as announcing that he would be taking "an indefinite break from professional golf."[6]
In the days and months following Woods' admission of infidelity, several companies re-evaluated their relationships with him. Accenture, AT&T, Gatorade and General Motors completely ended their sponsorship deals, while Gillette suspended advertising featuring Woods.[175][176][177] TAG Heuer dropped Woods from advertising in December 2009 and officially ended their deal when his contract expired in August 2011.[175][178] The magazine Golf Digest suspended Woods' monthly column beginning with the February 2010 issue.[179] In contrast, Nike continued to support Woods, as did Electronic Arts, which was working with Woods on the game Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online.[180] A December 2009 study estimated the shareholder loss caused by Woods' affairs to be between $5 billion and $12 billion.[181][182]
On February 19, 2010, Woods gave a televised statement in which he said he had been in a 45-day therapy program since the end of December. He again apologized for his actions. "I thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to," he said. "I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. I felt I was entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn't have to go far to find them. I was wrong. I was foolish." He said he did not know yet when he would be returning to golf.[183][184] He announced a few weeks later on March 16 that he would be returning at the 2010 Masters Tournament on April 8.[185]
Woods giving a speech at We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial (January 2009)
From childhood Woods was raised as a Buddhist, and actively practised this faith from childhood until well into his adult professional golf career.[187] In a 2000 article, Woods was quoted as saying he "believes in Buddhism... Not every aspect, but most of it."[188] He has attributed his deviations and infidelity to his losing track of Buddhism. He said that "Buddhism teaches me to stop following every impulse and to learn restraint. Obviously I lost track of what I was taught."[189]
Tiger Woods is registered to vote as an independent.[190] In January 2009, Woods delivered a speech commemorating the military at the We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial.[191][192] In April 2009, Woods visited the White House while in the Washington, D.C. area promoting the golf tournament he hosts, the AT&T National.[193]
Woods underwent laser eye surgery in 1999. Before this surgery, Woods eyesight was minus 11, meaning he was almost legally blind. He considered the surgery a big help in his career and a good alternative to the glasses and contact lenses.[194] He immediately started winning tour events after the surgery. He received money from TLC Laser Eye Centers to endorse them.[195] In 2007, he had a second laser eye surgery when his vision began to deteriorate again.[196]
