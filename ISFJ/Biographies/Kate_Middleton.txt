Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge (Catherine Elizabeth "Kate"; née Middleton; born 9 January 1982),[2] is the wife of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge. Following his father Charles, Prince of Wales, William is second in line to succeed his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, as monarch of 16 Commonwealth realms.[3]
Middleton grew up in Chapel Row, a village near Newbury, Berkshire, England.[4] She studied art history in Scotland at the University of St Andrews, where she met William in 2001. Their engagement was announced on 16 November 2010, and she attended many high-profile royal events before they married on 29 April 2011 at Westminster Abbey.
She has had a major impact upon British and American fashion which has been termed the "Kate Middleton effect", and in 2012 was selected as one of the "Most Influential People in the World" by Time magazine.[5][6] On 22 July 2013, she gave birth to a boy, Prince George of Cambridge, who is now third in the line of succession to the British throne.[7][8]
Catherine Elizabeth Middleton was born at Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading on 9 January 1982, and christened at St Andrew's Bradfield, Berkshire, on 20 June 1982.[9][10]:32 She is the eldest of three children born to Carole (née Goldsmith), a former flight attendant, and Michael Middleton, who also worked as a flight attendant prior to becoming a flight dispatcher for British Airways. Her parents were married on 21 June 1980, at the parish church of Dorney, Buckinghamshire.[11] In 1987, they founded Party Pieces, a mail order company that sells party supplies and decorations. Party Pieces is a private company with an estimated worth of £30 million.[12][13][14] The Middletons have another daughter, Philippa "Pippa",[15][16] and a son, James William Middleton.[16] The family complained about press harassment of Pippa and Carole following Middleton's engagement.[17]
Middleton's paternal ancestors were from Leeds, West Yorkshire. Her paternal great-grandmother, Olive, was a member of the Lupton family, who, for a number of generations, were woollen cloth merchants and manufacturers, active in civic affairs.[16][18] Her maternal ancestors, the Harrisons, were working-class labourers and miners from Sunderland and County Durham.[19]
Michael and Carole Middleton worked for British Airways, in Amman, Jordan, from May 1984 to September 1986. In Jordan, Middleton went to an English language nursery school[20] before returning to their home in Berkshire.[21] Following her return from Amman, Middleton was enrolled at St Andrew's School near the village of Pangbourne in Berkshire, then briefly at Downe House.[22] She attended Marlborough College, a co-educational independent boarding school in Wiltshire,[23] and graduated in 2005, from the University of St Andrews in Fife, Scotland, with an undergraduate MA (2:1 Hons) in the History of Art.[24] In November 2006, Middleton accepted a position as an accessory buyer with the clothing chain Jigsaw.[25]
In 2001, Middleton met Prince William while they were students at the University of St. Andrews. The couple began dating in 2003, although their relationship remained unconfirmed.[26][27] On 17 October 2005, Middleton complained through her lawyer about harassment from the media, stating that she had done nothing significant to warrant publicity.[28]
In February 2006, it was announced that Middleton would receive her own 24-hour security detail supplied by the Royalty Protection branch (SO14). Many speculated that she and Prince William would soon be engaged, since she would not otherwise be entitled to this service.
No engagement was forthcoming and Middleton was not granted an allowance to fund this security. Media attention increased around the time of her 25th birthday in January 2007, prompting warnings from both The Prince of Wales and Prince William and from Middleton's lawyers, who threatened legal action. Two newspaper groups, News International, which publishes The Times and The Sun; and the Guardian Media Group, publishers of The Guardian, decided to refrain from publishing paparazzi photographs of her.[29] Middleton attended at least one event as an official royal guest: Prince William's Passing Out Parade at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst on 15 December 2006.[30]
On 17 May 2008, Middleton attended the wedding of Prince William's cousin Peter Phillips to Autumn Kelly, which the prince did not attend.[31] On 19 July 2008, she was a guest at the wedding of Lady Rose Windsor and George Gilman. Prince William was away on military operations in the Caribbean, serving aboard HMS Iron Duke.[32] In 2010, Middleton pursued an invasion of privacy claim against two agencies and photographer Niraj Tanna, who took pictures of her over Christmas 2009.[33] She obtained a public apology, £5,000 in damages, and legal costs.[34]
In April 2007 Prince William and Middleton split up. The couple decided to break up during a holiday in the Swiss resort of Zermatt.[35] Clarence House declined to comment about the relationship's end, according to The Times, stating, "We don't comment on Prince William's private life".[36] Newspapers speculated about the reasons for the split, although these reports relied on anonymous sources. Middleton and her family attended the Concert for Diana at Wembley Stadium, where she and Prince William sat two rows apart. The couple were subsequently seen together in public on a number of occasions and news sources stated that they had "rekindled their relationship".[37]

Prince William and Catherine Middleton became engaged in October 2010, in Kenya, during a 10-day trip to the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy to celebrate Prince William's passing his RAF helicopter search and rescue course.[38][39] Clarence House announced the engagement on 16 November 2010.[38][40] Prince William gave Middleton the engagement ring that had belonged to his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The couple married in Westminster Abbey on 29 April 2011,[41] (St. Catherine's Day) with the day declared a bank holiday in the United Kingdom. Estimates of the global audience for the wedding ranged around 300 million or more, whilst 26 million watched the event live in Britain alone.[42][43][44]
In October, several months after the wedding, Commonwealth leaders pledged that they would implement changes in British royal succession law to adopt absolute primogeniture, meaning that the first child of the Duke and Duchess would be eligible to take the throne regardless of whether it is male or female.[45]
On 3 December 2012, St James's Palace announced that the Duchess was pregnant with her first child. The announcement was made earlier in the pregnancy than is traditional as she had been admitted to King Edward VII's Hospital Sister Agnes suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum and stayed there for three days.[46][47] On 14 January 2013, St James's Palace announced that the child was due to be born in July 2013, and that the condition of the Duchess was improving.[48]
In January 2013, the Queen issued new letters patent enabling all children of the eldest son, as opposed to only the eldest son, of the Prince of Wales to enjoy the princely title and style of Royal Highness.[49]
The Duchess was admitted to St Mary's Hospital in London in the early stages of labour on the morning of 22 July 2013, and gave birth to a boy, weighing 8 pounds 6 ounces (3.80 kg), at 16:24 BST that day.[7][8][50] On 24 July 2013, Kensington Palace announced that the baby would be named George Alexander Louis.[51]
Catherine became prominent for her fashion style and has been placed on numerous "best dressed" lists.[52][53] She was selected by The Daily Telegraph as the "Most Promising Newcomer" in its 2006 list of style winners and losers.[54] Tatler placed her at number 8 on its yearly listing of the top ten style icons in 2007.[55] She was featured in People magazine's 2007 and 2010 best-dressed lists.[56] Middleton was named as one of Richard Blackwell's ten "Fabulous Fashion Independents" of 2007.[57] In June 2008, Style.com selected Middleton as their monthly beauty icon.[58] In July 2008, Middleton was included in Vanity Fair's international best-dressed list.[59] In February 2011, she was named the Top Fashion Buzzword of the 2011 season by the Global Language Monitor.[60] In January 2012, she was voted 'Headwear Person of the Year.'[61] Middleton was number one on Vanity Fair's annual Best Dressed lists in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013; she also appeared as the cover star in 2012.[62][63] She was awarded the accolade of 'Best Celebrity Smile' in May 2012, after placing first in a poll by Bupa.[64]
Middleton was formally introduced to public life on 24 February 2011, two months before the wedding, when she and Prince William attended a lifeboat-naming ceremony in Trearddur, Anglesey, in North Wales.[65] A day later they appeared in St Andrews to launch the university's 600th anniversary celebrations. On 16 February 2011, Clarence House announced that the Duke and Duchess's first royal tour of Canada would take place in July 2011.[66] In May 2011, shortly after the wedding, Clarence House announced that the Duke and Duchess would extend their tour to visit California. This was to be the Duchess of Cambridge's first visit to the United States.[67]
The Duke and Duchess meet with U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama at Buckingham Palace a few weeks after the wedding.
The Duchess's first official engagement after the wedding came in May, when she and her husband met with Barack Obama, the President of the United States, and First Lady Michelle Obama.[68] In June 2011, the Duke and Duchess presented medals to members of the Irish Guards.[69]
On 26 October 2011, she undertook her first solo event for In Kind Direct, stepping in for the Prince of Wales, who was in Saudi Arabia.[70] On 2 November, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the UNICEF Supply Division Centre for supplying food to malnourished African children in Copenhagen, Denmark.[71][72]
On St Patrick's Day, 17 March 2012, the Duchess carried out the traditional awarding of shamrocks to the Irish Guards at their base in Aldershot; this was her first solo military engagement. On 19 March, she gave her first speaking engagement for the opening of the Treehouse, a new children's hospice opened by East Anglia's Children's Hospices (EACH), a charity of which she is a patron.[73]
Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge supporting British Olympic Team at a dinner in countdown to the 2012 Olympics in London, 11 May 2012
The Duchess has involved herself with the charities supported by her husband and his brother, Prince Harry. On 29 September 2011, the Duchess officially became a patron of The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry. In November 2011, April 2012, and November 2012, she and the Duke attended the biannual Princes' Charities Forum, which unites the various charitable interests of the two princes.[74] In June 2012, The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry was renamed The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, to reflect Catherine's contribution to the charity.[75]
The Duke and Duchess were announced as Ambassadors for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, alongside Prince Harry.[76] The Duchess attended both the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the Olympics.[77] On 29 August 2012, the Duchess attended the Paralympic Opening Ceremony accompanied by her husband, the Duke of Cambridge.[78] As part of her role, the Duchess attended numerous sporting events throughout the games.
In September 2012, the Duke and Duchess embarked on a tour of Singapore, Malaysia, Tuvalu, and the Solomon Islands as part of the Royal Jubilee celebrations. During this overseas visit, the Duchess made her first official speech abroad, while visiting a hospice in Malaysia, drawing on her experience as patron of East Anglia's Children's Hospices.[79]
Due to her pregnancy, the Duchess carried out fewer engagements in 2013 than in previous years. After the birth of Prince George, she carried out her first engagement in late August when she accompanied the Duke to meet runners preparing for an ultra-marathon on the isle of Anglesey, where they have a residence.[80]
At the beginning of March 2014 details were announced of the half-month long tour to New Zealand and Australia that the Duchess and her husband and son would be taking from 16 to 25 April.[81] The tour was Catherine's first visit to the area and Prince George's first major public appearance since his christening in October 2013.[82] The tour began in New Zealand where they visited Wellington, Blenheim, Auckland, Dunedin, Queenstown and Christchurch. It ended in Australia where they visited Sydney, the Blue Mountains, Brisbane, Uluru, Adelaide, and Canberra.[83]
In March 2011, William and Catherine set up a gift fund held by The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry to allow well-wishers who want to give them a wedding gift to donate money to charities they care about instead.[84] The gift fund supported 26 charities of the couple's choice, incorporating the armed forces, children, the elderly, art, sport and conservation. These causes are close to their hearts and reflect the experiences, passions and values of their lives so far.[85][86]
The Duchess supports charities The Art Room, National Portrait Gallery, London, East Anglia's Children's Hospice, Action on Addiction, Place2be, Natural History Museum and Sportsaid.[87][88] The Natural History Museum is a patronage formerly held by Diana, Princess of Wales.
She is also a local volunteer leader with the Scout Association in north Wales.[89] In October 2012, the Duchess gave her royal backing to the M-PACT programme (Moving Parents and Children Together), one of the only UK programmes to focus specifically on the impact of drug addiction on families as a whole.[90]
Her first official portrait was unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery in January 2013, meeting mixed reviews from both critics and audiences.[91]
In 1997, William's mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, died in a road accident in Paris while being chased by paparazzi.[92] This incident has influenced the Duke's attitude towards intrusive media attention.[93] Both the Duchess and her husband have been clear that, when off-duty, their privacy should be respected,[93] yet the media, at times, has violated the couple's wishes.
In 2009, before her engagement to William, Middleton was awarded £10,000 damages and an apology from the photographic press agency Rex Features Ltd after she was photographed playing tennis on Christmas Eve when on holiday in Cornwall.[94]
On 13 September 2012, it was reported that the French edition of "la presse people" magazine Closer and the Italian gossip magazine Chi, had both published photographs of the Duchess sun-bathing topless while on holiday at the Château d'Autet[93] (a private château on a 260-ha estate some 71 km[95] north of Aix-en-Provence). Analysts from The Times believed that the photograph was taken from the D22 (Vaucluse) road half a kilometre from the pool – a distance that would require an 800-mm or a 1000-mm lens.[96] On 17 September 2012, the Duke and Duchess laid a criminal complaint to the French Prosecution Department and launched a claim for civil damages at the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Nanterre;[97] the following day the courts granted an injunction against Closer prohibiting further publication of the pictures and also announced that a criminal investigation would be initiated.[98] Under French law, punitive damages cannot be awarded[99] but such intrusions of privacy are a criminal offence carrying a maximum jail sentence of one year and a fine of up to €45,000 for individuals and €225,000 for companies.[100][101]
In December 2012, two Australian radio hosts, Michael Christian and Mel Greig, called King Edward VII's Hospital Sister Agnes where the Duchess was an in-patient for hyperemesis gravidarum. Pretending to be the Queen and the Prince of Wales, Greig and Christian telephoned the hospital and spoke to a nurse, enquiring about the Duchess's condition. Following a hospital inquiry and a public backlash against the hoax, the nurse who put the call through, Jacintha Saldanha, committed suicide.[102] The radio hosts subsequently apologised for their actions.[103]
In its second breach of privacy, in February 2013, Chi published the first photos of Catherine's exposed baby bump, taken during her vacation on the private island of Mustique. The British press have refused to publish the paparazzi shots out of respect for the couple.[104]
Following international attention regarding the wedding, Lifetime aired a TV film entitled William & Kate on 18 April 2011, in the US.[105] The film premiered in the UK on 24 April 2011.[106] Middleton[107] was played by Camilla Luddington[108] and Prince William by Nico Evers-Swindell.[109] TV programmes were also shown in the UK prior to the wedding which provided deeper insights into the couple's relationship and backgrounds, including When Kate Met William[110] and Channel 4's Meet the Middletons.[111]
A second TV film was produced that covers similar ground to William & Kate. That film, titled William & Catherine: A Royal Romance and filmed in Bucharest,[112] stars Alice St. Clair as Kate Middleton and Dan Amboyer as Prince William.[113] Of note in this second television film is the appearance of Jane Alexander as the Queen and Victor Garber as the Prince of Wales. The film aired on 27 August 2011, in the United States on the Hallmark Channel.[114][115]
Catherine's full title and style is Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge, Countess of Strathearn and Lady Carrickfergus.[117][120][121][124]
Unlike the majority of royal brides, and in contrast to most previous consorts-in-waiting for over 350 years, Catherine's immediate family is neither aristocratic nor royal.[125][126] On the morning of their wedding day on 29 April 2011, at 8:00 am, officials at Buckingham Palace announced that in accordance with royal tradition and on recognition of the day by the Queen, Prince William was created Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus.[118]

In September 2013, the Queen granted a conjugal coat of arms to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, consisting of their individual arms displayed side by side, beneath a helm and coronet denoting the Duke's status as grandson of the Sovereign.[129] Below is shown the earlier grant of the Duchess's personal arms, impaled with those of her husband.
The Duchess bears the arms of her husband, Prince William, The Duke of Cambridge, impaled with those of her father, Michael Middleton. The coat of arms was granted to Middleton by the College of Arms on 19 April 2011. Thomas Woodcock, Garter King of Arms, the senior officer of the College of Arms, helped the family with the design.[130] The Duchess of Cambridge's coat of arms denotes that Catherine is the daughter of Michael Middleton and the wife of the Duke of Cambridge.[131]
Quarterly 1st and 4th Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or armed and langed Azure (England), 2nd Or a lion rampant Gules armed and langued Azure within a double tressure flory counterflory of the second (Scotland), 3rd Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (Ireland), the whole differenced with a label of three points Argent with the central point charged with an escallop Gules (Prince William); Impaled with a shield per pale Azure and Gules, a chevron Or, cotised Argent, between three acorns slipped and leaved Or (Middleton).[130]
To the dexter the Lion as borne and used as a Supporter by "Our Dearly Beloved Grandson His Royal Highness Prince William of Wales Duke of Cambridge" and to the sinister a Hind Argent unguled and gorged with "a Coronet of Our Dearly Beloved Grandson's degree Or". The hind is white (argent) and is hooved, unguled and has about its neck (is gorged with) the Duke of Cambridge's coronet. Both the hooves and coronet are gold (Or).[132]
The dividing line (between two colours) down the centre is a canting of the name 'Middle-ton'. The acorns (from the oak tree) are a traditional symbol of England and a feature of west Berkshire, where the family have lived for 30 years. The three acorns also denote the family's three children. The gold chevron in the centre of the arms is an allusion to Carole Middleton's maiden name of Goldsmith. The two white chevronels (narrow chevrons above and below the gold chevron) symbolise peaks and mountains, and the family's love of the Lake District and skiing.[130]
Her previous coat of arms depicted the shield from her father Michael Middleton's coat of arms shaped into a lozenge hanging from a blue ribbon symbolising her unmarried state. Her sister Pippa also uses the same lozenge-shaped coat of arms. Her brother, James, bears his father's arms, with a gold label for difference. In due course James will inherit his father's full coat of arms.[130]

      Gave birth to her 1st child at age 31, a son George Alexander Louis on July 22, 2013. Child's father is her husband, Prince William Windsor.
      Actually William wasn't there for quite a bit of the time initially, he wasn't there for Freshers Week, so it did take a bit of time for us to get to know each other but we did become very close friends from quite early.
      Well I think if you really go out with someone for quite a long time you do get to know each other very, very well, you go through the good times, you go through the bad times. You know both personally, but also within a relationship as well.
      I think, the people around home are very supportive to us and those are the people who really matter to us, our close friends and close family and I think if they feel you are doing the right thing you can only be true to yourself and you sort of have to ignore a lot of what's said, obviously take it on board, but you have to be yourself really and that's how I have stuck by it really.
      I really hope I can make a difference, even in the smallest way. I am looking forward to helping as much as I can.

Catherine Elizabeth "Kate" Middleton (born 9 January 1982)  married to Prince William of Wales, elder son of Prince Charles, and the late Diana, Princess of Wales.
After her marriage, the official title of Miss Catherine Middleton is - Her Royal Highness The    Duchess of Cambridge.
Born at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, Berkshire, England, Middleton is the elder daughter of self-made millionaire Michael Middleton (born 1949), who was an airline officer at the time of her birth, and his wife, the former Carole Goldsmith, who was an air hostess. Her parents now own Party Pieces, a mail order company that sells children's party paraphernalia. She has a younger sister, Philippa ("Pippa") and a younger brother, James.
Middleton was raised in Bucklebury, Berkshire, in the south of England. She went to St Andrew's School, Pangbourne until she was 13 and then attended the public school Marlborough College (the same school William's cousin Princess Eugenie of York attends), where she passed eleven GCSEs and three A-level exams. Like the Prince, Middleton was a student at the University of St Andrews in Fife, Scotland. She graduated in 2005 with a 2:1 (Upper Second-Class) MA (Hons) degree in History of Art.
In early 2006, it was rumoured that Middleton intended to found her own mail order company, selling high-end children's clothes. After a key investor stepped down, however, she decided to hold off on this plan. In November 2006, she accepted a position as an accessories buyer assistant with the British clothing chain Jigsaw.
While attending the University of St Andrews in 2001, Middleton met Prince William of Wales. At the time, Middleton was already in her second year at St Andrews. Since around Christmas of 2003 she and Prince William have been involved in a relationship that has been subjected to intense media attention.
The couple were first seen publicly on a ski trip in Klosters in April 2004. During 2005, the British media began speculating that the Prince and Middleton would eventually become engaged. 
Middleton's status as the girlfriend of Prince William  brought widespread media coverage in the UK and abroad, and was often photographed on her daily outings. On 17 October 2005, she complained through her lawyer about harassment from the media, stating that, she had done nothing to court publicity. In December 2005, the German magazine Das Nee published photos of the exterior of Middleton's London flat, revealing its location in London. This prompted a security review by police amidst concerns for her safety and a report in the London Evening Standard that Prince William was considering going to the European Court of Human Rights over concerns for Middleton's and his own privacy.
In February 2006, it was announced that Middleton would receive her own 24-hour security detail supplied by the Royalty and Diplomatic Protection Department. This fuelled further speculation that she and Prince William would soon be engaged, since she would not, otherwise, be entitled to this service. No engagement occurred, and Middleton was not granted an allowance to fund this security.      
In 2007, the couple briefly split after struggling to find time as Prince William pursued his army career. However, they soon came back together.        
On 16th November, 2010, Kate Middleton and Prince William announced their plans to marry in the new year.
Announcing their engagement Prince William said: "The timing is right now, we are both very, very happy."
            Miss Middleton added that joining the Royal Family was a "daunting prospect" but said: "Hopefully I'll take it in my stride." 
Kate Middleton and Prince William were married on Friday 29th April 2011 at Westminster Abbey, London. Catherine Middleton wore a  dress designed by Sarah Burton. The dress was ivory gown with lace applique    floral detail and an intricate train measuring  two metres 70 centimetres. Her tiara  was a little known 1936 Cartier "halo". It was loaned to her by the present Queen, a tradition for Royal Weddings.
On the morning of the wedding, the Queen gave a new title to her grandson, Prince William - The Duke of Cambridge. They have also been given the Scottish titles of Earl and Countess of    Strathearn. The couples third title is a Northern Irish one, Baron and Baroness    Carrickfergus.  
The official title for  Miss Catherine Middleton on her marriage is Her Royal Highness The    Duchess of Cambridge.
After the wedding, the couple intend to continue residing on the Isle of Anglesey in North Wales, where Prince William is based as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot.

                Kate Middleton was a student at the University of St Andrews in Fife, Scotland, where she graduated in 2005 with a bachelor's degree in the History of Art. In 2001, while in her second year at the University of St Andrews, Middleton met the future king. Since 2003, she and the prince have been in an on-again-off-again relationship that has been the subject of intense media scrutiny.She was born on 9 January 1982, in Berkshire, England, to pilot Michael and flight attendant Carole Middleton. In 1987, the Middletons founded their own party goods company, which helped to make them millionaires. Kate, the oldest of three children, has a younger sister, Philippa (Pippa), and a younger brother, James. Middleton attended the exclusive St Andrew's Prep School until she was 13 and then Marlborough College, where she passed 11 GCSEs and three A-level exams. She studied the History of Art at St Andrew's where she met Prince William, who is second in line to the throne, and the pair started a romantic relationship in 2003. In February 2006, it was announced that Middleton would receive her own 24-hour security detail from the Royalty and Diplomatic Protection Department. This led to rumours that Middleton was being groomed for a position of royalty. In 2007, however, the couple publicly split. Media reports said otherwise, as Middleton had been spotted at several royal events accompanied by the prince, and other rumours indicated that the couple had been living together. Both parties denied the rumours. In November 2006, Middleton accepted a position as an assistant accessories buyer with the British clothing chain Jigsaw, but it was reported that she left the company in order to study portrait photography. In 2010, it was revealed that Kate Middleton had been working on plans to start a new bakery business with her brother, James. Since 2007, James Middleton has been running The Cake Kit Company, with the goal of encouraging kids to cook and making the baking of party cakes easier. On 16 November 2010, it was announced that Prince William and Kate Middleton were engaged, with the wedding due to take place on 29 April 2011 at Westminster Abbey in London. Prince William had popped the question in October during a holiday in Kenya. It was also stated that the couple would live in north Wales, where Prince William is stationed with the Royal Air Force. On 5 January 2011, Clarence House released further details of the royal wedding. On the day of the wedding, which was declared a national bank holiday, Kate Middleton travelled to the service at Westminster Abbey by car following a route that took her past the Mall, Horse Guards Parade, Whitehall and Parliament Square in London.  The wedding service commenced at 11am on 29 April 2011 and the Dean of Westminster conducted the service, the Archbishop of Canterbury married the couple and the Bishop of London provided the address. She wore a wedding dress designed by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, as well as a tiara lent to her by the Queen. Her sister was maid of honour and wore a dress by the same designer. Middleton had a total of four bridesmaids and two pageboys. Once the service had been completed the married couple set off along a processional route by carriage to Buckingham Palace. The Queen gave a reception for the new couple and guests selected from the couple's official and social circles. During the reception, the Royal couple appeared on the balcony of the palace and enjoyed their first public kiss (two in fact) before the RAF conducted a fly-pass. The Prince of Wales hosted a private dinner, at Buckingham Palace in the evening, for the couple and their close friends and family. Kate Middleton and Prince William danced their first dance to a live performance of 'Your Song' by singer Ellie Golding. The reception ended at 3am with a small firework display. The event was watched by 26.3 million people in the UK alone and 500 street parties were held to commemorate the wedding. In honour of the wedding, luxury lifestyle magazine Tatler created a colourful cover featuring Kate Middleton's face portrayed in an Andy Warhol style for its February issue. Since the wedding, the Royal couple have moved into some rooms in Kensington Palace, although they consider their home to be their rented cottage in Anglesey. Middleton's wedding dress has also been displayed at Buckingham Palace for visitors to see, with more than 600,000 people paying to view the gown. On 18 October 2011, it was revealed that the new Duchess of Cambridge has undertaken her first act of personal charity. She wrote a handwritten letter to nine-year-old Fabian Bate, who has leukemia, praising him for his strength. She first met the youngster at the Royal Marsden Hospital on a visit to the new children's ward with her husband in September.

The Duchess of Cambridge (née Kate Middleton) profile: news, photos, style, videos and more – HELLO! Online
							Negotiating the cameras when you're pregnant with the 21st century's most anticipated baby is pretty daunting. Unless, perhaps, you're Kate Middleton. The wife of Prince William has handled the attention with the grace and good humour that the public has come to expect from her.						
						Back in 2000, as a pupil of Marlborough College, she can scarcely have imagined the implications her choice of university would have. 
Reviewing the reading material for her course, she can have had little idea that a brush with one particular fellow student would mean all her decisions from fashion choices to the name of a new puppy would come under intense scrutiny.
Signing up for a degree in History of Art at St Andrews brought her into the orbit of William Arthur Philip Louis Windsor, second in line to the throne and the future King. 
As housemates sharing a cottage in the Scottish town, Kate and the Prince fell for each other, and embarked on a romance that became a source of media interest across the world. 
At St Andrews the duo were protected from tabloid scrutiny by a gentleman's agreement between newspaper editors and the royal household. The slender brunette, who did well in both her school and university exams, would have been all too aware that the bubble of privacy would burst as soon as they graduated, however. 
University over, the Prince and his sweetheart moved to London where they found themselves facing new challenges. Kate set up home in the capital and accepted a position as a junior buyer with High Street fashion chain Jigsaw. Her royal beau, meanwhile, threw himself into the rigours of military training. 
While her sudden celebrity can't have been easy for the young graduate, she handled herself with poise and dignity. 
Catherine Elizabeth Middleton was born – the eldest of three children – on January 9, 1982, to Carol and Michael, both former British Airways employees. 
She grew up in a modest home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, where her family ran a party supplies business. This stable middle class upbringing stood her in good stead during the transition period. 
The romance between the Bucklebury lass and her blue-blooded beau appeared to be going from strength to strength, with Kate joining William, his father and brother, on several skiing holidays. 
By early 2006, speculation was rife that an engagement announcement was imminent, with one High Street store even going so far as to commission commemorative memorabilia. It came as a shock to royal watchers, therefore, to discover in April that the pair had called time on the romance and were to go their own ways. 
The separation didn't last long, however. By June there was speculation they'd rekindled their romance. And this seemed to be confirmed when in July Kate, accompanied by her mum, attended the Concert For Diana at Wembley Stadium – although the couple sat two rows apart and insisted they were "just good friends". 
With reports they'd decided to give their romance a second chance filling the papers, the couple were careful to conduct their relationship out of the limelight, and were rarely seen out clubbing together at their old haunts.
In late 2007, Kate resigned from her job at Jigsaw and later went on to take up a production post with her parents' firm. Working for mum and dad meant she was able to take time out to join the Prince on foreign holidays, support him on the sidelines at polo matches and attend family events as their relationship once again grew in strength.
In November 2010, Clarence House confirmed that Prince William had proposed to Kate a month earlier, and that the couple were engaged and set to marry.
On April 29 2011, Kate officially stepped into the royal circle and left her previous life as a commoner behind. 
The setting for the wedding of the century was Westminster Abbey. The bride was radiant in an Alexander McQueen ivory lace and silk dress featuring rose, thistle, daffodil and shamrock motifs, representing the four countries of the United Kingdom. 
She walked out Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge; from now on her every move would be headline news around the globe.
Fashionistas approved of her 'high-low' style, which married designer labels with High Street brands such as Topshop, Reiss and Zara.
The Duchess also won plaudits for her charity work with organisations such as Action on Addiction, East Anglia's Children's Hospice, The Scout Association and The National Portrait Gallery benefitting from her support. 
There have been tricky moments along way such as when she and her husband were photographed in intimate circumstances on a holiday in France. 
Aides issued a strongly worded statement on their behalf saying: "The incident is reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, and all the more upsetting to The Duke and Duchess for being so." 
Their unity and natural rapport has delivered other notable successes including their tour of Canada and the United States shortly after their wedding, their support for Team GB at the Olympics and the triumph of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. 
When it was announced in 2012 that Kate was expecting her first child the reaction was one of universal delight. On 22 July the following year, she gave birth to a little boy whom the couple named George Alexander Louis.
Named for the Queen's father and grandfather, he will eventually reign as King George VII. His arrival was celebrated with gun salutes in Green Park and the Tower of London, while the bells at Westminster Abbey rang for three hours continuously. 
The couple showed their little Prince off in a photocall outside St Mary's Hospital, London before whisking him off to the Middleton family home.
The King who will occupy the throne toward the end of the 21st century was to spend the first weeks of his life outside the walls of a palace, giving him the sort of excellent start that his mother herself had.

Catherine, Duchess of CambridgeRoyal ConsortBorn: 9 January 1982Birthplace: Reading, Berkshire, EnglandBest known as: The wife of Prince William, and the Duchess of CambridgeName at birth: Catherine MiddletonKate Middleton married Britain's Prince William on April 29, 2011 and is now known as the Duchess of Cambridge. She was known as Kate Middleton when she met the future king while both were studying art history at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. They became friends while sharing housing with other students in 2001, and began dating in 2003. Kate Middleton graduated from St. Andrews in 2005 with a degree in art history. She moved to London after graduation, and in 2006 began working as an accessory buyer for the fashion chain Jigsaw. Her status as a royal girlfriend generated intense media interest into 2007, when she and William ended their relationship. But they reunited later that year, and engagement speculation intensified. On 16 November 2010, the Royal Family announced that Kate Middleton and Prince William were engaged to be married. William is second in line to the British throne (behind Queen Elizabeth and her son, William's father, Prince Charles), making Kate the likely future queen of Great Britain. The Royal Wedding was held on 29 April 2011, a Friday, at Westminster Abbey in London. Queen Elizabeth announced before the wedding that she had bestowed the title of Duke of Cambridge on William, making Kate the Duchess of Cambridge, and the Queen also gave William and Kate the Scottish titles of Earl and Countess of Strathearn -- possibly a nod to their meeting at St. Andrews. Buckingham Palace announced on December 3, 2012 that the Duchess was pregnant with her first child. The child, a son, was born on 22 July 2013; he was named George Alexander Louis and is known as Prince George of Cambridge.  The child is now third in line to the throne, behind Prince Charles and Prince William.Extra credit: The Duchess of Cambridge has two siblings: a sister, Philippa (called Pippa, born 6 September 1983) and a brother, James (b. 1987). Pippa was the maid of honor at her sister's wedding... Kate Middleton's wedding dress was designed by Sarah Burton of the Alexander McQueen fashion house... Kate Middleton's parents are the founders of Party Pieces, a mail-order company that (according to its website) "specialises in providing top quality products for children's parties and delivering them to customers within a few days with a minimum of fuss"... British tabloids nicknamed her "Waity Katie" as her relationship with Prince William stretched on without an engagement... Many sources have called her Catherine since her engagement and marriage. According to the Royal Family's official website, "Miss Middleton uses both names equally, and she has never expressed a preference for either Catherine or Kate since her engagement to Prince William. Catherine is the name that Miss Middleton grew up with in her family, and Kate is the name that she tends to use in a work context"... Kate Middleton was born at Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, according to a 2009 story in The Daily Mail.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC. All rights reserved.
