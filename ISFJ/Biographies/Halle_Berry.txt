Halle Maria Berry (born Maria Halle Berry; August 14, 1966)[1] is an American actress and former fashion model. She won an Academy Award for Best Actress in 2002 for her performance in Monster's Ball, becoming the first and, as of 2014, the only woman of African-American descent to win an Oscar for a leading role. She was one of the highest paid actresses in Hollywood during the 2000s, and has been involved in the production side of several of the films in which she performed. Berry is also a Revlon spokesmodel.[2]
Before becoming an actress, Berry entered several beauty contests, finishing as the 1st runner-up in the Miss USA Pageant and coming in 6th place in the Miss World Pageant in 1986.[3] Her breakthrough film role was in 1992's Boomerang, which led to roles in films such as The Flintstones (1994), Bulworth (1998) and Introducing Dorothy Dandridge (1999), for which she won the Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, amongst many other awards. In addition to her Academy Award win, Berry reached a higher level of prominence in the new millennium with roles such as Storm in the X-Men film series (2000–present), Swordfish (2001), and Die Another Day (2002), where she played Bond Girl Jinx, later finding success in the 2010s with movies such as Cloud Atlas (2012) and The Call (2013).
Divorced from baseball player David Justice and musician Eric Benét, Berry has a daughter by model Gabriel Aubry, and a son with her current husband, actor Olivier Martinez.
Berry was born Maria Halle Berry, though her name was legally changed to Halle Maria Berry at the age of five.[4] Berry's parents selected her middle name from Halle's Department Store, which was then a local landmark in her birthplace of Cleveland, Ohio.[5] Her mother, Judith Ann (née Hawkins),[6] who has English and German ancestry, was a psychiatric nurse.[7] Her father, Jerome Jesse Berry, was an African American hospital attendant in the same psychiatric ward where her mother worked; he later became a bus driver.[5][8] Berry's maternal grandmother, Nellie Dicken, was born in the United Kingdom (Sawley, Derbyshire, England), while her maternal grandfather, Earl Ellsworth Hawkins, was born in Ohio.[9] Berry's parents divorced when she was four years old; she and her older sister, Heidi Berry-Henderson,[10] were raised exclusively by her mother.[5] Berry has said in published reports that she has been estranged from her father since her childhood,[5][11] noting in 1992, "I haven't heard from him since [he left]. Maybe he's not alive."[10]
Berry graduated from Bedford High School. She worked in the children's department at Higbee's Department store. She then studied at Cuyahoga Community College. In the 1980s, she entered several beauty contests, winning Miss Teen All American in 1985 and Miss Ohio USA in 1986.[3] She was the 1986 Miss USA first runner-up to Christy Fichtner of Texas. In the Miss USA 1986 pageant interview competition, she said she hoped to become an entertainer or to have something to do with the media. Her interview was awarded the highest score by the judges.[12] She was the first African-American Miss World entrant in 1986, where she finished sixth and Trinidad and Tobago's Giselle Laronde was crowned Miss World.[13] Berry then traveled to Chicago to pursue a career in modeling.[14]
In 1989, Berry moved to New York City to pursue her acting ambitions. During her early time there, she ran out of money and had to live briefly in a homeless shelter.[14][15][16] Later in 1989, her situation improved and she was cast in the role of model Emily Franklin in the short-lived ABC television series Living Dolls, which was shot in New York and was a spin-off of the hit series Who's the Boss?.[14] During the taping of Living Dolls, she lapsed into a coma and was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.[17][18][19] After the cancellation of Living Dolls, she moved to Los Angeles.[14] She went on to have a recurring role on the long-running primetime serial Knots Landing.
Her film debut was in a small role for Spike Lee's Jungle Fever (1991), in which she played Vivian, a drug addict.[5] That same year, Berry had her first co-starring role in Strictly Business. In 1992, Berry portrayed a career woman who falls for Eddie Murphy in the romantic comedy Boomerang. The following year, she caught the public's attention as a headstrong biracial slave in the TV adaptation of Queen: The Story of an American Family, based on the book by Alex Haley. Berry was in the live-action Flintstones movie playing the part of "Sharon Stone", a sultry secretary who seduced Fred Flintstone.[20]
Berry tackled a more serious role, playing a former drug addict struggling to regain custody of her son in Losing Isaiah (1995), starring opposite Jessica Lange. She portrayed Sandra Beecher in Race the Sun (1996), which was based on a true story, shot in Australia, and co-starred alongside Kurt Russell in Executive Decision. Beginning in 1996, she was a Revlon spokeswoman for seven years and renewed her contract in 2004.[2][21]
She starred alongside Natalie Deselle Reid in the 1997 comedy film B*A*P*S. In 1998, Berry received praise for her role in Bulworth as an intelligent woman raised by activists who gives a politician (Warren Beatty) a new lease on life. The same year, she played the singer Zola Taylor, one of the three wives of pop singer Frankie Lymon, in the biopic Why Do Fools Fall in Love. In the 1999 HBO biopic Introducing Dorothy Dandridge, she portrayed the first black woman to be nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award, and it was to Berry a heart-felt project that she introduced, co-produced and fought intensely for it to come through.[5] Berry's performance was recognized with several awards, including an Emmy and a Golden Globe.[3][22]
Berry portrayed the mutant superhero Storm in the film adaptation of the comic book series X-Men (2000) and its sequels, X2: X-Men United (2003), X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) and X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014). In 2001, Berry appeared in the film Swordfish, which featured her first topless scene.[23] At first, she refused to be filmed topless in a sunbathing scene, but she changed her mind when Warner Brothers raised her fee substantially.[24] The brief flash of her breasts added $500,000 to her fee.[25] Berry considered these stories to be rumors and was quick to deny them.[23][26] After turning down numerous roles that required nudity, she said she decided to make Swordfish because her then-husband, Eric Benét, supported her and encouraged her to take risks.[27]
She appeared as Leticia Musgrove, the troubled wife of an executed murderer (Sean Combs), in the 2001 feature film Monster's Ball. Her performance was awarded the National Board of Review and the Screen Actors Guild best-actress prizes; in an interesting coincidence she became the first African-American to win the Academy Award for Best Actress (earlier in her career, she portrayed Dorothy Dandridge, the first African-American to be nominated for Best Actress, and who was born at the same hospital as Berry, in Cleveland, Ohio).[28] The NAACP issued the statement: "Congratulations to Halle Berry and Denzel Washington for giving us hope and making us proud. If this is a sign that Hollywood is finally ready to give opportunity and judge performance based on skill and not on skin color then it is a good thing."[29] Her role also generated controversy. Berry's graphic nude love scene with a racist character played by co-star Billy Bob Thornton was the subject of much media chatter and discussion among African-Americans. Many in the African-American community were critical of Berry for taking the part.[27] Berry responded: "I don't really see a reason to ever go that far again. That was a unique movie. That scene was special and pivotal and needed to be there, and it would be a really special script that would require something like that again."[27]
Berry asked for a higher fee for Revlon advertisements after winning the Academy Award. Ron Perelman, the cosmetics firm's chief, congratulated her, saying how happy he was that she modeled for his company. She replied, "Of course, you'll have to pay me more." Perelman stalked off in a rage.[30] Her win at the Academy Awards led to two famous "Oscar moments." In accepting her award, she gave an acceptance speech honoring previous black actresses who had never had the opportunity. She said, "This moment is so much bigger than me. This is for every nameless, faceless woman of colour who now has a chance tonight because this door has been opened."[31] One year later, as she presented the Best Actor award, winner Adrien Brody ran on stage and, instead of giving her the standard peck on the cheek, planted a long kiss on Berry.
As Bond girl Giacinta 'Jinx' Johnson in the 2002 blockbuster Die Another Day, Berry recreated a scene from Dr. No, emerging from the surf to be greeted by James Bond as Ursula Andress had 40 years earlier.[32] Lindy Hemming, costume designer on Die Another Day, had insisted that Berry wear a bikini and knife as a homage.[33] Berry has said of the scene: "It's splashy", "exciting", "sexy", "provocative" and "it will keep me still out there after winning an Oscar."[27] The bikini scene was shot in Cadiz; the location was reportedly cold and windy, and footage has been released of Berry wrapped in thick towels in between takes to try to stay warm.[34] According to an ITV news poll, Jinx was voted the fourth toughest girl on screen of all time.[35] Berry was hurt during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye. It was removed in a 30-minute operation.[36] After Berry won the Academy Award, rewrites were commissioned to give her more screentime for X2.[37]
She starred in the psychological thriller Gothika opposite Robert Downey, Jr. in November 2003, during which she broke her arm in a scene with Downey, who twisted her arm too hard. Production was halted for eight weeks.[38] It was a moderate hit at the United States box office, taking in $60 million; it earned another $80 million abroad.[39] Berry appeared in the nu metal band Limp Bizkit's music video for Behind Blue Eyes for the motion picture soundtrack for the film. The same year, she was named #1 in FHM's 100 Sexiest Women in the World poll.[40]
Berry received $12.5 million for the title role in the film Catwoman,[39] a $100 million movie; it grossed $17 million on its first weekend.[41] She was awarded a "worst actress" Razzie award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so)[42] with a sense of humor, considering it an experience of the "rock bottom" in order to be "at the top".[43] Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, "I never in my life thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, my mother told me that if you could not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner."[28] The Fund for Animals praised Berry's compassion towards cats and for squelching rumors that she was keeping a Bengal tiger from the sets of Catwoman as a "pet."[44]
Her next film appearance was in the Oprah Winfrey-produced ABC TV movie Their Eyes Were Watching God (2005), an adaptation of Zora Neale Hurston's novel, in which Berry portrayed Janie Crawford, a free-spirited woman whose unconventional sexual mores upset her 1920s contemporaries in a small community. She was nominated for an Emmy for this TV film. Meanwhile, she voiced the character of Cappy, one of the many mechanical beings in the animated feature Robots (2005).[45]
Berry is involved in production of films and television. She served as executive producer on Introducing Dorothy Dandridge in 1999, and Lackawanna Blues in 2005. Berry both produced and starred in the thriller Perfect Stranger with Bruce Willis and in Things We Lost in the Fire with Benicio del Toro, the first film in which she worked with a female director, Danish Susanne Bier, a new feeling of "thinking the same way", which she appreciated.[46] Berry then starred in the film Frankie and Alice, in which she plays Frankie Murdoch, a young multiracial American women with dissociative identity disorder struggling against her alter personality to retain her true self. She was awarded the African-American Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama.
Berry was one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood during 2000's, earning an estimated $10 million per film.[47] In July 2007, she topped In Touch magazine's list of the world's most fabulous 40-something celebrities. On April 3, 2007, she was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in front of the Kodak Theatre at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard for her contributions to the film industry.[48] As of 2013, Berry's worldwide box office gross has been more than 3.3 billion US$. In 2011, she appeared in New Year's Eve. She played one of the leads in the film Cloud Atlas, which was released in October 2012.[49] On October 4, 2013 Berry signed on to star in the CBS drama series Extant.[50] Berry will play Molly Watts, an astronaut who struggles to reconnect with her husband and android son after spending 13 months in space. The show will premier on July 9, 2014.[51][52] She will also serve as a co-executive producer on the series. Berry has served for many years as the face of Revlon cosmetics and as the face of Versace. The Coty Inc. fragrance company signed Berry to market her debut fragrance in March 2008. Berry was delighted, saying that she had created her own fragrances at home by mixing scents.[53]
In March 2014 Berry launched new production company, 606 Films, with producing partner Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas. Named after the Anti-Paparazzi Bill, SB 606, that the actress pushed for and was signed into law by Californian Governor Jerry Brown in the fall of 2013. The new company emerges as part of a deal for Berry to star in the CBS sci-fi drama Extant. 606 Films will be housed within CBS.[54]
In February 2000, Berry was involved in a traffic collision in which she left the scene of the accident. Some in the media complained that her misdemeanor hit and run charge was preferential treatment;[55][56] she had also been the driver in an alleged hit-and-run incident three years earlier in which no charges were filed.[57] Berry pleaded no contest, did community service, paid a fine and was placed on three years' probation.[58] A civil lawsuit was settled out of court.[59][60]
Berry dated Chicago dentist John Ronan from March 1989 to October 1991.[61] In November 1993, Ronan sued Berry for $80,000 in what he claimed were unpaid loans to help launch her career.[62] Berry contended that the money was a gift, and a judge dismissed the case because Ronan did not list Berry as a debtor when he filed for bankruptcy in 1992.[63]
Berry married baseball player David Justice shortly after midnight on January 1, 1993.[64] Following their separation in February 1996, Berry stated publicly that she was so depressed that she considered taking her own life,[65][66] Berry and Justice were officially divorced on June 24, 1997.[67]
Berry married her second husband, Eric Benét, on January 24, 2001, following a two-year courtship.[27][68] but by early October 2003 they had separated,[68] with the divorce finalized on January 3, 2005.[69][70] Benét underwent treatment for sex addiction in 2002.[71]
Berry began dating French Canadian model Gabriel Aubry in November 2005. The couple met at a Versace photoshoot.[72] Berry gave birth to their daughter, Nahla, on March 16, 2008.[73] On April 30, 2010, Berry and Aubry announced their separation.[74]
Berry began dating French actor Olivier Martinez in 2010 after they met while filming Dark Tide in South Africa.[75] They confirmed their engagement in March 2012,[76][77] and married in France on July 13, 2013.[78] They have a son, Maceo, born on October 5, 2013.[79]
After their 2010 separation, Berry and Aubry became involved in a highly publicized custody battle,[80][81][82] centered primarily on Berry's desire to move with their daughter Nahla from Los Angeles, where Berry and Aubry currently reside, to Martinez's native France. Aubry objected to the move, on the grounds that it would interfere with their joint custody arrangement.[83] In November 2012, a judge denied Berry's request to move Nahla to France in light of Aubry's objections.[84] Less than two weeks later, on November 22, 2012, Aubry and Martinez were both treated at a hospital for injuries after engaging in a physical altercation at Berry's residence. Martinez performed a citizen's arrest on Aubry, and because it was considered a domestic violence incident, was granted a temporary emergency protective order preventing Aubry from coming within 100 yards of Berry, Martinez, and Nahla until November 29, 2012.[85] In turn, Aubry obtained a temporary restraining order against Martinez on November 26, 2012, asserting that the fight began when Martinez threatened to kill Aubry if he did not allow the couple to move to France.[86] Leaked court documents included photos showing significant injuries to Aubry's face, which were widely displayed in the media.[87] On November 29, 2012, Berry's lawyer announced that Berry and Aubry had reached an amicable custody agreement in court.[88]
Along with Pierce Brosnan, Cindy Crawford, Jane Seymour, Dick Van Dyke, Téa Leoni, and Daryl Hannah, Berry successfully fought in 2006 against the Cabrillo Port Liquefied Natural Gas facility that was proposed off the coast of Malibu.[89] Berry said, "I care about the air we breathe, I care about the marine life and the ecosystem of the ocean."[90] In May 2007, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the facility.[91] Hasty Pudding Theatricals gave her its 2006 Woman of The Year award.[92]
Berry took part in a nearly 2000-house cell-phone bank campaign for Barack Obama in February 2008.[93] In April 2013, she appeared in a video clip for Gucci's "Chime for Change" campaign that aims to raise funds and awareness of women's issues in terms of education, health, and justice.[94] In August 2013, Berry testified alongside Jennifer Garner before the Assembly Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would protect celebrities' children from harassment by photographers.[95] The bill passed in September.[96]
Berry was ranked No. 1 on People's "50 Most Beautiful People in the World" list in 2003 after making the top ten seven times and appeared No. 1 on FHM 100 Sexiest Women in the World the same year.[97][98] She was named Esquire magazine's "Sexiest Woman Alive" in October 2008, about which she stated "I don't know exactly what it means, but being 42 and having just had a baby, I think I'll take it."[99][100] Men's Health ranked her at No. 35 on their "100 Hottest Women of All-Time" list.[101] In 2009, she was voted #23 on Empire's 100 Sexiest Film Stars.[102] The same year, rapper Hurricane Chris released a song entitled "Halle Berry (She's Fine)", extolling Berry's beauty and sex appeal.[103]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Halle Berry was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to an African-American father, Jerome Berry, a former hospital attendant, and a European-American mother, Judith (Hawkins) Berry, a retired psychiatric nurse. Halle has an older sister named Heidi Berry. Halle first came into the spotlight at seventeen years when she won the Miss Teen All-American Pageant, representing the state of Ohio in 1985 and, a year later in 1986, when she was the first runner-up in the Miss U.S.A. Pageant. After participating in the pageant, Halle became a model. It eventually led to her first weekly TV series, 1989's Living Dolls (1989), where she soon gained a reputation for her on-set tenacity, preferring to "live" her roles and remaining in character even when the cameras stopped rolling. It paid off though when she reportedly refused to bathe for several days before starting work on her role as a crack addict in Spike Lee's Jungle Fever (1991) because the role provided her big screen breakthrough. The following year, she was cast as Eddie Murphy's love interest in Boomerang (1992), one of the few times that Murphy was evenly matched on screen. In 1994, Berry gained a youthful following for her performance as sexy secretary "Sharon Stone" in The Flintstones (1994). She next had a highly publicized costarring role with Jessica Lange in the adoption drama Losing Isaiah (1995). Though the movie received mixed reviews, Berry didn't let that slow her down, and continued down her path to super-stardom. In 1998, she received critical success when she starred as a street smart young woman who takes up with a struggling politician in Warren Beatty's Bulworth (1998). The following year, she won even greater acclaim for her role as actress Dorothy Dandridge in made-for-cable's Introducing Dorothy Dandridge (1999), for which she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a TV Movie/Mini-Series.

      She was placed on three years probation and ordered to pay $13,500 in fines and penalties after pleading no contest on May 10, 2000 to a misdemeanor charge of leaving the scene of a traffic accident. The judge also ordered the actress to perform 200 hours of community service and to make restitution as determined by the outcome of civil litigation arising from the February accident when she was driving a rented Chevrolet Blazer and ran a red light and crashed into another car on Sunset Boulevard. She left the scene of the accident before authorities arrived, suffered a gash to her head that required 20 stitches to close, and the woman (Hetal Raythatha) driving the other vehicle broke her wrist. Halle reported the accident to a police officer at the hospital where she sought treatment.

      "This moment is so much bigger than me, This moment is for Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll... It's for the women that stand beside me, Jada Pinkett Smith, Angela Bassett, Vivica A. Fox... and it's for every nameless, faceless woman of color that now has a chance, because the door tonight has been opened." During her Oscar acceptance speech.
      On choosing both serious and popcorn-movie roles: "There's art and there's commerce. You have to find a way to mesh the two. It's important to do the little movies just for the love of the art. But it's those big movies that take you around the world and make you globally famous."
      I'll never get married again, and I always hate to say never to anything, but I will never marry again.
      I was black growing up in an all-white neighborhood, so I felt like I just didn't fit in. Like I wasn't as good as everybody else, or as smart, or whatever.
      Blackness is a state of mind and I identify with the black community. Mainly, because I realized, early on, when I walk into a room, people see a black woman, they don't see a white women. So out of that reason alone, I identify more with the black community.
      I don't see a white woman. I see a black woman, even though my mother is white [her father Jerome is black]. Knowing that has made my life easier, I think.
      I want to be the next Spike Lee. I want to help other black folks to get into Hollywood and be successful in Hollywood.
      What is my real purpose here? I've looked at what I do. I make believe and make movies. I entertain people and get paid for it. Sometimes it seems like such a shallow existence. How insignificant in the scheme of life.
      When I was a kid, my mother told me that if you could not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner. And I hope to God I never see these people again. - on accepting her Razzie Award for Worst Actress.
      I never wanted to be a model. My modeling career was nothing but a stepping stone to my acting career and that's all I ever saw it as. A pointless rock in the river that has to be stepped on in order to get to the meaningful oasis of acting.
      I guess you could say I have bad taste in men. But I no longer feel the need to be someone's wife.
      (On receiving a film festival award while pregnant) I am three times the girl I used to be. This is the second red carpet where I didn't have to think about sucking in my stomach - because I can't!
      You think you know what love is - until you have a child and discover that unconditional mother love.
      I once was stupid enough to say, in a previous relationship, 'I'm going to be with this person forever,' and realised, as I grew, that I don't know if forever is possible.
      When you have children, you get to see things all over again. So I've never laughed as hard, I've never done more silly things. And I go to great lengths to make my daughter laugh.
      [on her evolving style and archiving her clothes] My style has evolved in a nice way, but everyone has bad moments. Someone just showed me a photo from the '80s in which I was wearing a polka-dot and flower-print suit with puffy sleeves. At the time I thought I was stylin'! But no.
      [on what she's learned through the growth of her career and aging] Throughout my career I have been talked out of things I wanted to do, and when I look back I think, I should have followed my instincts. I relied on others to guide me because I thought they knew better. But as I've gotten older, I've learned to trust myself.
      [on having short hair] I think I am at my best when my hair is short. It's easier to take care of and more of who I am. Women are conditioned to think we need long hair. I see that happening with my daughter. She is so in love with her hair right now. She says, 'Look, Mommy - it's so long!" As women, we think it defines us, and we learn that at a young age.
      [on her fashion advice for anyone] Don't be a slave to trends. People who are never develop their own style. I have friends who are tragic-always trying to wear the latest thing, and it doesn't always look good on them. I mean, that may be good on Kate Moss on the runway, but honey, you can't pull it off.
      I'm embracing the fact that with each new year comes a new line on my face, and that just makes me more of who I'm evolving into.

                Halle Berry is living proof that some models can act. Beauty queen, desired model and finally successful actress, Berry was the first African American woman to win the Best Actress Oscar for her part in ‘Monsters Ball’ - the story of a woman who has an affair with a racist ex-jailer who oversaw the execution of her husband.Born to an African American father and a white mother on 14 August 1966, Berry had difficulty as a child, fitting neither in the black community nor the white. She capitalised on her looks on the catwalk as a young teenager, and later turned to professional modelling.  The TV series 'Living Dolls' (1989) was her first acting job and from there she moved on to 'Knots Landing' (1991). As a TV actress, Berry gained the reputation of living her roles - she would continue in character for the entire duration of a shoot, regardless of whether the cameras were rolling or not.  Her method worked well for her first film, Spike Lee's 'Jungle Fever (1991), when she refused to bathe for days before starting to act the role of a crack addict. The film announced the arrival of a formidable actress who was immediately rewarded with two nods - the nominations for Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress and for most promising actress.  Flitting between comic and hard-hitting roles, Berry established a healthy rapport with her audience and the critics, winning her considerable acclaim in the late 1990s. A number of roles in movies including 'The Last Boy Scout', 'The Flintstones', 'Losing Isaiah', 'The Rich Man's Wife' and 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love' followed before she gained the attention of critics once more in a television film directed by Martha Coolidge. 1999's 'Introducing Dorothy Dandridge' earned Berry a Primetime Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award and her second NAACP Image Award.  Less commended was her part opposite John Travolta in the terrible thriller 'Swordfish'. The film sold itself as the first to reveal Berry's breasts, and did little to recommend her as a serious actress. Director Marc Forster, undeterred by this blip, went on to cast Berry in 'Monster's Ball', a role that brilliantly revealed an inner turmoil and brought the actress to the brink of superstardom.  Berry's crowning glory came in 2001 when her part in the film not only catapulted her into history books as the first African American woman to win the Academy Award for Best Actress, but won her several other accolades and nominations. These included the Screen Actors Guild, BAFTA and Golden Globe awards for best actress.  Such achievement deserved even more rewards and 2002 delivered one when she became a Bond Girl in 'Die Another Day' alongside Pierce Brosnan. However, her appearance in 'Catwoman' (2004) landed her a less than desired Razzie Award for Worst Actress and, being "a good loser", she actually turned up to receive it.  One of her most notable roles in recent years is the mutant Storm, who can manipulate the weather, in the 'X-Men' film franchise. She first played this character in 2000's 'X-Men', followed by 'X2' in 2003 and 'X-Men: The Last Stand' in 2006.  She has also acted in the thriller 'Gothika' with Robert Downey JR in 2003. Berry then voiced the character Cappy in the animated 'Robots' in 2005. This was followed by 'Perfect Stranger' and 'Things We Lost In The Fire' in 2007. After this she took a three-year sabbatical as she gave birth to her daughter Nahla Ariela Aubry on 16 March 2008. She took some time out to focus on bringing up her child with Gabriel Aubry.  Berry returned to film in 2010 with a role in 'Frankie & Alice', which was followed by a role in 'New Year's Eve' in 2011. This year, she has appeared in 'Dark Tide' and 'Cloud Atlas' which also stars Tom Hanks, Ben Whishaw and Hugh Grant. She is currently filming 'The Hive', which will be released in 2013, along with 'Shoe Addicts Anonymous', which also features Berry.  Her personal life has been mixed thanks to two failed marriages to David Justice between 1992 and 1997 and musician Eric Benét from 2001 to 2005. She was also involved with Gabriel Aubry, who was her partner from 2005 to 2010 and she is currently seeing Olivier Martinez. In March 2012, the French actor confirmed his engagement to Berry.

Life's Work"I don't want to be just a sex goddess," film and television actress Halle Berry divulged to Lawrence Chua in Elle, "but then I don't want to play just crackheads either." Notable whether playing ingénues or junkies, she has performed roles in films as diverse as Boomerang, which starred Eddie Murphy, and filmmaker Spike Lee's controversial Jungle Fever. A former model and first runner-up in the Miss USA pageant, Berry, who also appeared on television as Debbie Porter on Knots Landing, postulates that planning helped her leap to leading lady status in the film industry. The actress told Chua, "Preparation, luck and opportunity seemed to come together at the same time."Born to a white mother and black father, Berry grew up in Cleveland, Ohio. Her parents separated when she was four years old. Halle and her sister Heidi were raised by their mother, Judith, a registered nurse. Throughout her childhood, Berry recalled, she was so shy her mother had to coax her to leave home to go downtown. Being the offspring of a biracial couple, Berry had her initial encounter with prejudice as a youngster, when her family moved from an inner-city neighborhood to suburban Cleveland. "People would call me 'zebra' and leave Oreo cookies in our mailbox," she recounted to Chua. When she questioned her mother about these incidents, Berry related in Ebony, her mother explained, "I'm white, and you are Black.... What do you see when you look in the mirror? You see what everyone else sees. They don't know that you're biracial. They don't know who your mother is, and they aren't going to care."From the time she was in grade school, Berry wanted to be an actress. She related to Laurie Werner in USA Weekend, "I would imitate scenes from The Wizard of Oz. I even had the right dog." A cheerleader, Berry also became prom queen and class president during her high school years. When she was 17 years old, Berry was surprised to learn one of her high school boyfriends had entered her name in the Miss Teen Ohio beauty pageant. Winning the title, she then entered a succession of other pageants, including Miss World, in which she won the dress competition. Berry was also named first runner-up in the Miss USA competition after her selection as Miss Ohio in 1985.In 1986 Berry enrolled at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland to study broadcast journalism. When she took an internship at a local radio station, Berry discovered she disliked reporting. She left college before completing her degree to pursue modeling and study acting in Chicago. Her mother encouraged the career transition, Berry divulged to Chua: "When I left home to start acting, [my mother's] attitude was, 'Keep your chin up, go do it; but if you fail, home is always here.'"While in Chicago, Berry auditioned for a role in producer Aaron Spelling's television pilot Charlie's Angels '88. Although the show did not materialize, Spelling was impressed with Berry's screen test. He encouraged her not to give up acting. Two big breaks in the young actress's career came with a three-week USO tour with Bob Hope and a starring role as a teenage fashion model in the short-lived television series Living Dolls. Berry remarked in Ebony, "Here I was an ex-model, a former beauty queen and when Living Dolls was canceled, I was playing a model. People weren't taking me seriously."Hoping audiences would view her differently, Berry prepared for her next role as a crack addict named Vivien in Jungle Fever by interviewing several crack addicts and going ten days without a bath. Although her role brought her acclaim, Berry took a recurring part in the television series Knots Landing for financial purposes. "I'm a real miser," the actress told Werner. "I want a cushion," she added.After Berry's 1991 appearance as a femme fatale in the motion picture Strictly Business, Peter Biskind wrote in Premiere, "Berry may still be playing somebody's girlfriend, but clearly her star is ascending." The actress almost lost the leading role of Natalie in the comedy. She recalled to Chua, "I found out that they hired me, thought I was too light-skinned, hired someone darker, realized that was a mistake, and then hired me again. And I understood that I had gone through all of this agony for two weeks just because of my skin color."Although critics were divided in their reviews of the film, Berry's portrayal marked a turning point in her career. Her appearance in leading roles was assured with her selection as Damon Wayans' exotic dancer girlfriend in the movie The Last Boy Scout. Vincent Canby of the New York Times wrote, "The best thing in the film is Halle Berry. She is an actress who is going places." Berry researched her role in the movie by paying the owner of a Hollywood strip joint to let her dance. After the film's success, Berry commented to Biskind, "I don't want to rise to superstardom overnight, like Julia Roberts. There's no place to go but down.""Though she is an imposing beauty ... Berry's radiant looks belie the strengths that have made her a young actress worth watching," wrote Chua in 1992, after the release of the comedy Boomerang. Judy Gerstel of the Detroit Free Press lauded Berry in the film as "versatile," noting that her role as Angela was "played to doe-eyed perfection." The year Boomerang was released, Ebony profiled the young actress as an image breaker: "A down-to-earth, drop-dead gorgeous woman, Berry exudes confidence, having already shattered the Hollywood adage that models can't act."As her film career picked up steam, Berry began a relationship with Atlanta Braves baseball player, David Justice. Their whirlwind courtship began in 1992 and ended when Berry proposed to him, and the couple were married on New Year's Day in 1993. She told Ebony in 1994 that Justice was her "soulmate, my rock, my prince on a white horse." Compared to the other men Berry had been involved with, Justice was Prince Charming. One of her ex-boyfriends sued her and sold his story to a national tabloid newspaper. Another ex hit her in the ear so hard she lost 80 percent of her hearing in that ear.The couple were likened to another famous couple, Marilyn Monroe and Joe Dimaggio. And like them, the marriage ended in divorce. Just a couple of months after celebrating their third anniversary, Justice asked for a divorce. It devastated Berry. She told Ebony in 1997: "I was numb for probably two months. I was walking around in a daze. I didn't know how to function. I would wake up in the middle of the night and think this is just a bad dream. I kept saying, 'No, this isn't really real. David's just on a road trip.'"Her friends rallied to support Berry--her mother even flew to Los Angeles to be with her. But she still had self-doubts and thoughts of suicide. Berry even made an attempt by getting in her car to inhale toxic fumes, but she recalled to Ebony, "somewhere in my heart, I think I knew I didn't really want to end my life. I just wanted to end the pain."Berry entered therapy and threw herself into her work. Her next film, B.A.P.S., was a comedy directed by Robert Townsend. She described to Ebony how working on this film helped her heal, "It's a comedy, and I wasn't very funny, so I wasn't confident that I would be able to be in that space. But it turned out to be therapeutic. I could laugh and be silly and let go of all that negative energy."Throughout her acting career, Berry has sought roles that were diverse. She went from a hip-hop dancer in Strictly Business to a college co-ed in The Program to playing a recovering drug addict fighting for her son in Losing Isaiah--she won raves for this portrayal. She is also known to play characters of the past. She portrayed Alex Haley's paternal grandmother in "Queen," a television miniseries. She took a turn as a pre-historic secretary in the live-action film, The Flintstones, and she played Sheba in "Solomon and Sheba," a made for cable television movie. This also marked the first time an African American has portrayed Sheba, who was an Ethiopian. In one year alone, Berry portrayed the love interest of Warren Beatty in Bulworth, then a young woman trying to choose between two men while dealing with her past in "The Wedding," produced by Oprah Winfrey, and Why Do Fools Fall In Love?, a movie based on singer Frankie Lymon's life, where she played Zola Taylor, a member of the singing group The Platters and one of Lymon's wives.In addition to becoming one of Hollywood's best known African American actresses, Berry returned to modeling when she signed with Revlon Cosmetics. She also signed on for many more movie appearances. Berry was a huge hit in the 1999 HBO biopic Introducing Dorothy Dandridge. The film told the life story of Dandridge, a promising young nightclub singer-turned-actress who faced racial prejudice during the 1950s as she tried to become a star. Dandridge was the first black sex symbol of the big screen and the first black actress to receive an Academy Award nomination, though she never achieved star status because of her skin color. Berry, herself, was eager to play the role and counts Dandridge among her idols. As Berry told Jet, "I was mesmerized by her poise and her charisma. I had never seen a Black woman quite like that in a film. She was someone I could admire and aspire to be like. She gave me hope."Playing Dandridge pushed Berry to new heights as an actress and she impressed director Martha Coolidge, who told Jet, "There couldn't be a better person  to portray Dorothy Dandridge. She is beautiful in the same way. She also has an incredible sensitivity. She is absolutely driven in the same way and, even today, feels the same outrage at limitations placed on her that Dorothy felt in her day." Berry won several awards for her role, including a Golden Globe for best performance by an actress in a miniseries or made-for-TV motion picture.Berry was just getting stared. In 2001 she blew audiences away in Monster's Ball, portraying Leticia Musgrove, a black woman who becomes involved with her husband's white prison guard executioner. Renowned movie critic Roger Ebert proclaimed the movie to be the best of the year. Sure enough, Berry won an Academy Award for best actress in a leading role, becoming the first African American to win in that category.Berry also tried her hand at sci-fi fantasy, starring in X-Men in 2000 and X2 in 2003, proving herself to be a successful action heroine who could draw people into the box office. X-Men had a colossal opening, drawing $54 million its first weekend, which was the largest-ever opening for a non-sequel film. Berry failed, however, in trying to bring the comic-book heroine Catwoman to life in 2004. This flick garnered horrible reviews, especially for Berry. Critics lambasted her performance, saying she never should have taken the role, which was more suited for a person with a dancing background who could pull off the feline moves. Berry's performance was so bad it earned her a Razzie Award for worst actress. Putting the failure behind her, Berry turned to filming X-Men 3, due in 2006, and looked forward to the future. Despite the shortcomings of some of her films, Berry, unlike Dandridge, has successfully fought Hollywood's racism and risen above her circumstances. She has proven to herself--and others--that she is a fighter and will continue to do so.

A woman whose combination of talent, tenacity, and beauty has made her one of Hollywood's busiest actors, Halle Berry has enjoyed a level of success that has come from years of hard work and her share of career pitfalls. 
Berry's interest in show business came courtesy of her participation in a number of beauty pageants throughout her teens, including the 1986 Miss U.S.A. Pageant. A native of Cleveland, OH, where she was born to an African-American father and white mother on August 14, 1968, Berry was raised by her mother, a psychiatric nurse, following her parents' divorce. At the age of 17, she appeared in the spotlight for the first time as the winner of the Miss Teen All-American Pageant, and subsequently became a model. Berry won her first professional acting gig on the TV series Living Dolls, and then appeared on Knots Landing before winning her first big-screen role in Spike Lee's Jungle Fever. It was on the set of the film that she first earned her reputation for her full commitment to acting, reportedly refusing to bathe for weeks in preparation for her portrayal of a crack addict.
Following her film debut, Berry was cast opposite Eddie Murphy in Boomerang (1992) as the comedian's love interest; not only did she hold her own against Murphy, but the same year she did acclaimed work in the title role of the Alex Haley miniseries Queen, playing a young woman struggling against the brutal conditions of slavery.
After a comedic turn as sultry secretary Sharon Stone in the 1994 live-action version of The Flintstones, Berry returned to more serious fare with her role in the adoption drama Losing Isaiah (1995). Starring opposite Jessica Lange as a former crack addict battling to win custody of her child, who as a baby was adopted by an affluent white couple, Berry earned a mixed reception from critics, some of whom noted that her scenes with Lange highlighted Berry's own shortcomings.
However, critical opinion of the actress' work was overwhelmingly favorable in 1998, when she starred as a street smart young woman who comes to the aid of a bumbling politician in Warren Beatty's Bullworth. The following year, Berry won even greater acclaim -- and an Emmy and Golden Globe -- for her turn as tragic screen siren Dorothy Dandridge in the made-for-cable Introducing Dorothy Dandridge. Unfortunately, any acclaim Berry enjoyed was overshadowed by her widely publicized brush with the law in February of 2000, when she allegedly ran a red light, slammed into another car, and then left the scene of the accident. The actress, who suffered a gash to her forehead (the driver of the other car sustained a broken wrist), was booked in a misdemeanor court in early April of that year.
Fortunately for Berry, her subsequent onscreen work removed the spotlight from her legal troubles; that same year, she starred as Storm in Bryan Singer's hugely successful adaptation of The X-Men. The film was a box office hit, but her next popcorn flick, the thriller Swordfish, which touted itself as the first movie to feature Berry baring her breasts, had a less impressive reception.
Berry again bared more than her character's inner turmoil in Monster's Ball (2001), a romantic drama directed by Marc Forster that starred the actress as a woman who becomes involved with an ex-prison-guard (Billy Bob Thornton) who oversaw the prison execution of her husband (Sean Combs). Berry earned wide critical praise for her work in the film, as well as Golden Globe and Oscar nominations for Best Actress. And though she may have lost out to Sissy Spacek in the Golden Globes, her night at the Oscars found Berry the favored performer as took home a statue for Best Actress. A momentous footnote in  Academy Award history, Berry's win marked the first time an African American had been bestowed that particular honor.
Although her turn in the James Bond flick Die Another Day was so successful that talk began of a spin-off film, Berry's first true post-Oscar vehicle Gothika proved to be unpopular with both critics and moviegoers. Luckily, 2003 wasn't a total loss for her though as X2: X-Men United was a box-office smash and was regarded by many to be superior to its predecessor. Sticking with comic-books as source-material, Berry could be seen in Catwoman the following Summer. The film was the biggest flop of her career, panned by audiences and critics, and earning the actress a coveted Razzie for her terrible performance. She won back a great deal of respect, however, by starring in the made for TV adaptation of the Zora Neale Hurston novel Their Eyes Were Watching God the next year. She followed this moving performance with a return to her X-Men comrades for X-Men: The Last Stand in 2006, then signed on to star alongside a decidedly creepy Bruce Willis in the suspense thriller Perfect Stranger (2007), directed by James Foley.
She next took on the uplifting psychological drama Things We Lost in the Fire (2007) - as an emotionally shattered housewife, reeling from the tragic violent death of her husband. She followed this up with the light hearted one-crazy-night romcom New Year's Eve, followed by the oceanic thriller Dark Tide, from the director of Into the Blue. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi

Halle Maria Berry (pron.: /ˈhæli ˈbɛri/; born August 14, 1966[1]) is an American actress and former fashion model. Berry received an Emmy, Golden Globe, SAG, and an NAACP Image Award for Introducing Dorothy Dandridge[2] and won an Academy Award for Best Actress and was nominated for a BAFTA Award in 2001 for her performance in Monster's Ball, becoming the first and only woman of African American descent to have won the award for Best Actress. She is one of the highest paid actresses in Hollywood and has been involved in the production side of several of the films in which she performed. Berry is also a Revlon spokesmodel.[3][4]
Before becoming an actress, Berry entered several beauty contests, finishing as the 1st runner-up in the Miss USA Pageant (1986), and coming in 6th place in the Miss World Pageant in 1986.[2] She made her film debut in 1991 with a brief appearance in Jungle Fever. Her breakthrough was in 1992's Boomerang, which led to roles in films such as The Flintstones (1994) and Bulworth (1998). In addition to her Academy Award win, the 21st century brought a new level of prominence to Berry, with roles in films such as Storm in the X-Men film series (2000-present), Die Another Day (2002), where she played Bond Girl Jinx, and Cloud Atlas (2012). She also won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress in 2005 for Catwoman and accepted the award in person, one of the few people to do so.[5]
Berry was born Maria Halle Berry, though her name was legally changed to Halle Maria Berry in 1971.[6] Berry's parents selected her middle name from Halle's Department Store, which was then a local landmark in her birthplace of Cleveland, Ohio.[7] Her mother, Judith Ann (née Hawkins),[8] who is of English and Polish descent, was a psychiatric nurse.[9] Her father, Jerome Jesse Berry, was an African American hospital attendant in the same psychiatric ward where her mother worked; he later became a bus driver.[7][10] Berry's maternal grandmother, Nellie Dicken, was born in Sawley, Derbyshire, England, while her maternal grandfather, Earl Ellsworth Hawkins, was born in Ohio.[11] Berry's parents divorced when she was four years old; she and her older sister Heidi[12] were raised exclusively by her mother.[7] Berry has said in published reports that she has been estranged from her father since her childhood,[7][13] noting in 1992, "I haven't heard from him since [he left]. Maybe he's not alive."[12]
Berry graduated from Bedford High School. She worked in the children's department at Higbee's Department store. She then studied at Cuyahoga Community College. In the 1980s, she entered several beauty contests, winning Miss Teen All American in 1985 and Miss Ohio USA in 1986.[2] She was the 1986 Miss USA first runner-up to Christy Fichtner of Texas. In the Miss USA 1986 pageant interview competition, she said she hoped to become an entertainer or to have something to do with the media. Her interview was awarded the highest score by the judges.[14] She was the first African-American Miss World entrant in 1986, where she finished sixth and Trinidad and Tobago's Giselle Laronde was crowned Miss World.[15]
Berry traveled to Chicago in the late 1980s to pursue a career in modeling and acting.[16] One of her first acting projects was Chicago Force, a television series for local cable by Gordon Lake Productions.
In 1989, Berry moved to New York City to further pursue her acting ambitions. During her early time there she ran out of money and had to live briefly in a homeless shelter.[16][17][18] Later in 1989, her situation improved and she was cast in the role of model Emily Franklin in the short-lived ABC television series Living Dolls, which was shot in New York and was a spin-off of the hit series Who's the Boss?.[16] During the taping of Living Dolls, she lapsed into a coma and was diagnosed with diabetes.[19][20] After the cancellation of Living Dolls, she moved to Los Angeles.[16] She went on to have a recurring role on the long-running primetime serial Knots Landing.
Her film debut was in a small role for Spike Lee's Jungle Fever (1991), in which she played Vivian, a drug addict.[7] That same year, Berry had her first co-starring role in Strictly Business. In 1992, Berry portrayed a career woman who falls for Eddie Murphy in the romantic comedy Boomerang. That same year, she caught the public's attention as a headstrong biracial slave in the TV adaptation of Queen: The Story of an American Family, based on the book by Alex Haley. Berry was in the live-action Flintstones movie playing the part of "Sharon Stone", a sultry secretary who seduced Fred Flintstone.[21]
Berry tackled a more serious role, playing a former drug addict struggling to regain custody of her son in Losing Isaiah (1995), starring opposite Jessica Lange. She portrayed Sandra Beecher in Race the Sun (1996), which was based on a true story, shot in Australia, and co-starred alongside Kurt Russell in Executive Decision. Beginning in 1996, she was a Revlon spokeswoman for seven years and renewed her contract in 2004.[4][22]
She starred alongside Natalie Deselle Reid in the 1997 comedy film, B*A*P*S. In 1998, Berry received praise for her role in Bulworth as an intelligent woman raised by activists who gives a politician (Warren Beatty) a new lease on life. The same year, she played the singer Zola Taylor, one of the three wives of pop singer Frankie Lymon, in the biopic Why Do Fools Fall in Love. In the 1999 HBO biopic Introducing Dorothy Dandridge, she portrayed the first black woman to be nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award, and it was to Berry a heart-felt project that she introduced, co-produced and fought intensely for it to come through.[7] Berry's performance was recognized with several awards, including an Emmy and a Golden Globe.[2][23]
Berry portrayed the mutant superhero Storm in the film adaptation of the comic book series X-Men (2000) and its sequels, X2: X-Men United (2003), X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) and X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014). In 2001, Berry appeared in the film Swordfish, which featured her first topless scene.[24] At first, she refused to be filmed topless in a sunbathing scene, but she changed her mind when Warner Brothers raised her fee substantially.[25] The brief flash of her breasts added $500,000 to her fee.[26] Berry considered these stories to be rumors and was quick to deny them.[24][27] After turning down numerous roles that required nudity, she said she decided to make Swordfish because her husband, Benét, supported her and encouraged her to take risks.[28]
She appeared as Leticia Musgrove, the troubled wife of an executed murderer, in the 2001 feature film Monster's Ball. Her performance was awarded the National Board of Review and the Screen Actors Guild best-actress prizes; in an interesting coincidence she became the first African-American to win the Academy Award for Best Actress (earlier in her career she portrayed Dorothy Dandridge, the first African-American to be nominated for Best Actress, and who was born at the same hospital as Berry, in Cleveland, Ohio).[29] The NAACP issued the statement: "Congratulations to Halle Berry and Denzel Washington for giving us hope and making us proud. If this is a sign that Hollywood is finally ready to give opportunity and judge performance based on skill and not on skin color then it is a good thing."[30] Her role also generated controversy. Berry's graphic nude love scene with a racist character played by co-star Billy Bob Thornton was the subject of much media chatter and discussion among African-Americans. Many in the African-American community were critical of Berry for taking the part.[28] Berry responded: "I don't really see a reason to ever go that far again. That was a unique movie. That scene was special and pivotal and needed to be there, and it would be a really special script that would require something like that again."[28]
Berry asked for a higher fee for Revlon advertisements after winning the Academy Award. Ron Perelman, the cosmetics firm's chief, congratulated her, saying how happy he was that she modeled for his company. She replied, "Of course, you'll have to pay me more." Perelman stalked off in a rage.[31] Her win at the Academy Awards led to two famous "Oscar moments." In accepting her award, she gave an acceptance speech honoring previous black actresses who had never had the opportunity. She said, "This moment is so much bigger than me. This is for every nameless, faceless woman of colour who now has a chance tonight because this door has been opened."[32] One year later, as she presented the Best Actor award, winner Adrien Brody ran on stage and, instead of giving her the standard peck on the cheek, planted a long kiss on Berry.
As Bond girl Giacinta 'Jinx' Johnson in the 2002 blockbuster Die Another Day, Berry recreated a scene from Dr. No, emerging from the surf to be greeted by James Bond as Ursula Andress had 40 years earlier.[33] Lindy Hemming, costume designer on Die Another Day, had insisted that Berry wear a bikini and knife as an homage.[34] Berry has said of the scene: "It's splashy", "exciting", "sexy", "provocative" and "it will keep me still out there after winning an Oscar."[28] The bikini scene was shot in Cadiz; the location was reportedly cold and windy, and footage has been released of Berry wrapped in thick towels in between takes to avoid catching a chill.[35] According to an ITV news poll, Jinx was voted the fourth toughest girl on screen of all time.[36] Berry was hurt during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye. It was removed in a 30-minute operation.[37] After Berry won the Academy Award, rewrites were commissioned to give her more screentime for X2.[38]
She starred in the psychological thriller Gothika opposite Robert Downey, Jr. in November 2003, during which she broke her arm in a scene with Downey, who twisted her arm too hard. Production was halted for eight weeks.[39] It was a moderate hit at the United States box office, taking in $60 million; it earned another $80 million abroad.[40] Berry appeared in the Limp Bizkit music video for Behind Blue Eyes for the motion picture soundtrack for the film. The same year, she was named #1 in FHM's 100 Sexiest Women in the World poll.[41]
Berry received $12.5 million for the title role in the film Catwoman,[40] a $100 million movie; it grossed $17 million on its first weekend.[42] She was awarded a "worst actress" Razzie award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, to ever do so)[43] with a sense of humor, considering it an experience of the "rock bottom" in order to be "at the top".[5] Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, "I never in my life thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, my mother told me that if you could not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner."[29] The Fund for Animals praised Berry's compassion towards cats and for squelching rumors that she was keeping a Bengal tiger from the sets of Catwoman as a "pet."[44]
Her next film appearance was in the Oprah Winfrey-produced ABC TV movie Their Eyes Were Watching God (2005), an adaptation of Zora Neale Hurston's novel, in which Berry portrayed Janie Crawford, a free-spirited woman whose unconventional sexual mores upset her 1920s contemporaries in a small community. She was nominated for an Emmy for this TV film. Meanwhile, she voiced the character of Cappy, one of the many mechanical beings in the animated feature Robots (2005).[45]
Berry is involved in production of films and television. She served as executive producer on Introducing Dorothy Dandridge in 1999, and Lackawanna Blues in 2005. Berry both produced and starred in the thriller Perfect Stranger with Bruce Willis and in Things We Lost in the Fire with Benicio del Toro, the first film in which she worked with a female director, Danish Susanne Bier, a new feeling of "thinking the same way", which she appreciated.[46] Berry then starred in the film Frankie and Alice, in which she plays Frankie Murdoch, a young multiracial American women with dissociative identity disorder struggling against her alter personality to retain her true self. She was awarded the African-American Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama.
Berry is one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood, earning $10 million per film.[3] In July 2007, she topped In Touch magazine's list of the world's most fabulous 40-something celebrities. On April 3, 2007, she was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in front of the Kodak Theatre at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard for her contributions to the film industry.[47][48] As of 2011, Berry's worldwide box office gross has been more than 2.7 billion US$. In 2011, she appeared in New Year's Eve. She played one of the leads in the film Cloud Atlas, which was released in October 2012.[49] Berry has served for many years as the face of Revlon cosmetics and as the face of Versace. The Coty Inc. fragrance company signed Berry to market her debut fragrance in March 2008. Berry was delighted, saying that she had created her own fragrances at home by mixing scents.[50]
Berry has been married twice. Her first marriage was to former baseball player David Justice, from 1993[51] to 1996. Their divorce was finalized in 1997.[52] Berry has stated publicly that she was so depressed after her breakup with Justice that she considered taking her own life,[53] but she was concerned about how the afterlife would be for someone who had committed suicide.[54][55]
She was married to Eric Benét from early 2001 to 2005.[28][56] Berry credited Benét with support after she was involved in a February 2000 traffic collision, in which she left the scene of the accident. Some in the media complained that her misdemeanor hit and run charge was preferential treatment;[57][58] she had also been the driver in an alleged hit and run incident three years earlier in which no charges were filed.[59] The incident became fodder for comedians. Berry pleaded no contest, did community service, paid a fine and was placed on three years' probation.[60] A civil lawsuit was settled out of court.[61][62] The divorce was finalized in January 2005.[63]
Berry began dating Québécois model Gabriel Aubry in November 2005. The couple met at a Versace photoshoot.[64] Berry gave birth to a girl named Nahla Ariela Aubry in 2008, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.[65] Nahla means "honeybee" in Arabic; Ariela is Hebrew for "lion for God".[66] On April 30, 2010, Berry and Aubry announced their separation.[67] Berry subsequently began dating French actor Olivier Martinez in 2010. Martinez confirmed their engagement in March 2012.[68][69]
After their 2010 separation, Berry and Aubry became involved in a highly-publicized custody battle,[70][71][72] centered primarily on Berry's desire to move with their daughter Nahla from Los Angeles, where Berry and Aubry currently reside, to Martinez's native France. Aubry objected to the move, on the grounds that it would interfere with their joint custody arrangement.[73] In November 2012, a judge denied Berry's request to move Nahla to France in light of Aubry's objections.[74] Less than two weeks later, on November 22, 2012, Aubry and Martinez were both treated at a hospital for injuries after engaging in a physical altercation at Berry's residence. Martinez performed a citizen's arrest on Aubry, and because it was considered a domestic violence incident, was granted a temporary emergency protective order preventing Aubry from coming within 100 yards of Berry, Martinez, and Nahla until November 29, 2012.[75] In turn, Aubry obtained a temporary restraining order against Martinez on November 26, 2012, asserting that the fight began when Martinez threatened to kill Aubry if he did not allow the couple to move to France.[76] Leaked court documents included photos showing significant injuries to Aubry's face, which were widely displayed in the media.[77] On November 29, 2012, Berry's lawyer announced that Berry and Aubry had reached an amicable custody agreement in court.[78]
Along with Pierce Brosnan, Cindy Crawford, Jane Seymour, Dick Van Dyke, Téa Leoni, and Daryl Hannah, Berry successfully fought in 2006 against the Cabrillo Port Liquefied Natural Gas facility that was proposed off the coast of Malibu.[79] Berry said, "I care about the air we breathe, I care about the marine life and the ecosystem of the ocean."[80] In May 2007, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the facility.[81] Hasty Pudding Theatricals gave her its 2006 Woman of The Year award.[82]
Berry took part in a nearly 2000-house cell-phone bank campaign for Barack Obama in February 2008.[83]
Berry was ranked No. 1 on People's "50 Most Beautiful People In The World," in 2003 after making the top ten list seven times and appeared No. 1 on FHM 100 Sexiest Women in the World the same year.[84][85] She was named Esquire magazine's "Sexiest Woman Alive" in October 2008, about which she stated "I don't know exactly what it means, but being 42 and having just had a baby, I think I'll take it."[86][87] Men's Health ranked her at No. 35 on their "100 Hottest Women of All-Time" list.[88] In 2009, she was voted #23 on Empire's 100 Sexiest Film Stars.[89] The same year, rapper Hurricane Chris released a song entitled "Halle Berry (She's Fine)," extolling Berry's beauty and sex appeal.[90]
