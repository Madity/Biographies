David Howell Petraeus AO (/pɨˈtreɪ.əs/; born November 7, 1952) is a retired American military officer and public official. He served as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency from September 6, 2011,[3] until his resignation on November 9, 2012.[4] Prior to his assuming the directorship of the CIA, Petraeus was a highly decorated four-star general, serving over 37 years in the United States Army. His last assignments in the Army were as commander of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and Commander, U.S. Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A) from July 4, 2010, to July 18, 2011. His other four-star assignments include serving as the 10th Commander, U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) from October 13, 2008, to June 30, 2010, and as Commanding General, Multi-National Force – Iraq (MNF-I) from February 10, 2007, to September 16, 2008.[5] As commander of MNF-I, Petraeus oversaw all coalition forces in Iraq.[6][7]
Petraeus has a B.S. degree from the United States Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1974 as a distinguished cadet (top 5% of his class). In his class were three other future four-star generals, Martin Dempsey, Walter L. Sharp and Keith B. Alexander. He was the General George C. Marshall Award winner as the top graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College class of 1983.[8] He subsequently earned an M.P.A. in 1985 and a Ph.D. degree in International Relations in 1987 from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. He later served as Assistant Professor of International Relations at the United States Military Academy and also completed a fellowship at Georgetown University.[9]
Petraeus has repeatedly stated that he has no plans to run for elected political office.[10][11][12][13] On June 23, 2010, President Barack Obama nominated Petraeus to succeed General Stanley McChrystal as commanding general of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, technically a step down from his position as Commander of United States Central Command, which oversees the military efforts in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Central Asia, the Arabian Peninsula, and Egypt.[14][15][16]
On June 30, 2011, Petraeus was unanimously confirmed as the next Director of the CIA by the U.S. Senate 94–0.[17] Petraeus relinquished command of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan on July 18, 2011, and retired from the U.S. Army on August 31, 2011.[18] On November 9, 2012, General Petraeus resigned from his position as Director of the CIA, citing his extramarital affair which was reportedly discovered in the course of an FBI investigation.[19]
Petraeus was born in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York, the son of Miriam (née Howell), a librarian, and Sixtus Petraeus, a Frisian[20] sea captain from Franeker, Netherlands.[21] His mother was American, a resident of Brooklyn, New York.[22] His father had sailed to the United States from the Netherlands at the start of World War II.[23] They met at the Seamen's Church Institute of New York and New Jersey and married. Sixtus Petraeus commanded a Liberty ship for the U.S.A. for the duration of World War II.[22] The family moved after the war, settling in Cornwall-on-Hudson, where David Petraeus grew up and graduated from Cornwall Central High School in 1970.
Petraeus went on to the United States Military Academy at West Point. Petraeus was on the intercollegiate soccer and ski teams, was a cadet captain on the brigade staff, and was a "distinguished cadet" academically, graduating in the top 5% of the Class of 1974 (ranked 43rd overall). In the class yearbook, Petraeus was remembered as "always going for it in sports, academics, leadership, and even his social life".[24]
While a cadet, Petraeus started dating the daughter of Army General William A. Knowlton (the West Point superintendent at the time), Hollister "Holly" Knowlton (born c. 1953).[25] Two months after graduation Petraeus married her.[2][26] Holly, who is multi-lingual, was a National Merit Scholar in high school, and graduated summa cum laude from Dickinson College. They have a daughter and son, Anne and Stephen. Petraeus administered the oath of office at his son's 2009 commissioning into the Army after his son's graduation from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[27][28] His son went on to serve in Afghanistan as a member of 3rd Platoon, Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team.[29]
Petraeus' official residence in the United States is a small property in the community of Springfield, New Hampshire, which his wife inherited from her family.[30] Registered to vote in that state as a Republican, Petraeus once told a friend that he was a Rockefeller Republican.[31]
Petraeus graduated from West Point in 1974. He earned the General George C. Marshall Award as the top graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College Class of 1983 at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He subsequently earned an M.P.A. in 1985 and a PhD degree in international relations in 1987 from Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, at that time served as an Assistant Professor of International Relations at the U.S. Military Academy from 1985 to 1987. His doctoral dissertation was entitled "The American Military and the Lessons of Vietnam: A Study of Military Influence and the Use of Force in the Post-Vietnam Era".[32] He also completed a military fellowship at Georgetown University's Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service in 1994–1995,[citation needed] although he was called away early to serve in Haiti as the Chief of Operations for NATO there in early 1995.[33]
From late 2005 through February 2007,[34] Petraeus served as Commanding General of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center (CAC) located there. As commander of CAC, Petraeus was responsible for oversight of the Command and General Staff College and seventeen other schools, centers, and training programs as well as for developing the Army's doctrinal manuals, training the Army's officers, and supervising the Army's center for the collection and dissemination of lessons learned. During his time at CAC, Petraeus and Marine Lt. Gen. James N. Mattis jointly oversaw the publication of Field Manual 3–24, Counterinsurgency, the body of which was written by an extraordinarily diverse group of military officers, academics, human rights advocates, and journalists who had been assembled by Petraeus and Mattis.[35][36] Additionally, at both Fort Leavenworth and throughout the military's schools and training programs, Petraeus integrated the study of counterinsurgency into lesson plans and training exercises. In recognition of the fact that soldiers in Iraq often performed duties far different from those they trained for, Petraeus also stressed the importance of teaching soldiers how to think as well as how to fight and the need to foster flexibility and adaptability in leaders,[37][38] he has been called "the world's leading expert in counter-insurgency warfare".[39] Later, having refined his ideas on counterinsurgency based on the implementation of the new counterinsurgency doctrine in Iraq, he published both in Iraq as well as in the Sep/Oct 2008 edition of Military Review his "Commander's Counterinsurgency Guidance" to help guide leaders and units in the Multi-National Force-Iraq.[40]
Upon his graduation from West Point in 1974, Petraeus was commissioned an infantry officer. After completing Ranger School (Distinguished Honor Graduate and other honors), Petraeus was assigned to the 509th Airborne Battalion Combat Team, a light infantry unit in Vicenza, Italy. Ever since, light infantry has been at the core of his career, punctuated by assignments to mechanized units, unit commands, staff assignments, and educational institutions. After leaving the 509th as a first lieutenant, Petraeus began a brief association with mechanized units when he became assistant operations officer on the staff of the 2nd Brigade, 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) at Fort Stewart, Georgia. In 1979, he assumed command of a company in the same division: ALPHA Company, 2nd Battalion, 19th Infantry Regiment (Mechanized), and then served as that battalion's operations officer, a major's position that he held as a junior captain. In 1988–1989, he also served as operations officer to the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized)'s 1st Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment (Mechanized) and its 1st Brigade.
In 1981, Petraeus became aide-de-camp to the Commanding General of the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized).[41] He spent the next few years furthering his military and civilian education, including spending 1982–83 at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, attending the Command and General Staff College. At graduation in 1983, he was the General George C. Marshall Award winner as the top graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College. From 1983–85 he was at Princeton; and 1985–87 at West Point. After earning his PhD and teaching at West Point, Petraeus continued up the rungs of the command ladder, serving as military assistant to Gen. John Galvin, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. From there, he moved to the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized) and then to a post as aide and assistant executive officer to the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Carl Vuono, in Washington, D.C.
Upon promotion to lieutenant colonel, Petraeus moved from the office of the Chief of Staff to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where he commanded the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault)'s 3rd Battalion 187th Infantry Regiment, known as the "Iron Rakkasans",[42] from 1991–1993. During this period, he suffered one of the more dramatic incidents in his career; in 1991 he was accidentally shot in the chest with an M-16 assault rifle during a live-fire exercise when a soldier tripped and his rifle discharged.[43] He was taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, where he was operated on by future U.S. Senator Bill Frist. The hospital released him early after he did fifty push-ups without resting, just a few days after the accident.[44][45]
During 1993–94, Petraeus continued his long association with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) as the division's Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3 (plans, operations and training) and installation Director of Plans, Training, and Mobilization (DPTM). In 1995, he was assigned to the United Nations Mission in Haiti Military Staff as its Chief Operations Officer during Operation Uphold Democracy. His next command, from 1995–97, was the 1st Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division, centered on the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment. At that post, his brigade's training cycle at Fort Polk's Joint Readiness Training Center for low-intensity warfare was chronicled by novelist and military enthusiast Tom Clancy in his book Airborne. From 1997–99 Petraeus served in the Pentagon as Executive Assistant to the Director of the Joint Staff and then to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Henry Shelton, who described Petraeus as "a high-energy individual who likes to lead from the front, in any field he is going into".[46] In 1999, as a brigadier general, Petraeus returned to the 82nd, serving as the assistant division commander for operations and then, briefly, as acting commanding general. During his time with the 82nd, he deployed to Kuwait as part of Operation Desert Spring, the continuous rotation of combat forces through Kuwait during the decade after the Gulf War.
From the 82nd, he moved on to serve as Chief of Staff of XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg during 2000–2001. In 2000, Petraeus suffered his second major injury, when, during a civilian skydiving jump, his parachute collapsed at low altitude due to a hook turn, resulting in a hard landing that broke his pelvis. He was selected for promotion to Major General in 2001.[47] During 2001–2002, as a brigadier general, Petraeus served a ten-month tour in Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of Operation Joint Forge. In Bosnia, he was the NATO Stabilization Force Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations as well as the Deputy Commander of the U.S. Joint Interagency Counter-Terrorism Task Force, a command created after the September 11 attacks to add counterterrorism capability to the U.S. forces attached to the NATO command in Bosnia. In 2004, he was promoted to Lieutenant General.[48] In 2007, he was promoted to General.[49] On April 23, 2008, Secretary of Defense Gates announced that President Bush was nominating General Petraeus to command U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM), headquartered in Tampa, Florida. The nomination required and received Senate confirmation.[50] He was confirmed by the Senate on June 30, 2010,[51] and took over command from temporary commander Lieutenant-General Sir Nick Parker on July 4, 2010.[52]
Maj. Gen. David H. Petraeus (right), commanding general, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), looks on as Lt. Gen. William S. Wallace, V Corps commanding general speaks to soldiers, March 21, 2003, Kuwait.
In 2003, Petraeus, then a Major General, saw combat for the first time when he commanded the 101st Airborne Division during V Corps's drive to Baghdad. In a campaign chronicled in detail by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Rick Atkinson of The Washington Post in the book In the Company of Soldiers, Petraeus led his division through fierce fighting south of Baghdad, in Karbala, Hilla and Najaf. Following the fall of Baghdad, the division conducted the longest heliborne assault on record in order to reach Ninawa Province, where it would spend much of 2003. The 1st Brigade was responsible for the area south of Mosul, the 2nd Brigade for the city itself, and the 3rd Brigade for the region stretching toward the Syrian border. An often-repeated story of Petraeus' time with the 101st is his asking of embedded The Washington Post reporter Rick Atkinson to "Tell me how this ends,"[53] an anecdote he and other journalists have used to portray Petraeus as an early recognizer of the difficulties that would follow the fall of Baghdad.[41][54][55][56][57][58]
In Mosul, a city of nearly two million people, Petraeus and the 101st employed classic counterinsurgency methods to build security and stability, including conducting targeted kinetic operations and using force judiciously, jump-starting the economy, building local security forces, staging elections for the city council within weeks of their arrival, overseeing a program of public works, reinvigorating the political process,[59][60][61] and launching 4,500 reconstruction projects in Iraq.[62] This approach can be attributed to Petraeus, who had been steeped in nation-building during his previous tours in nations such as Bosnia and Haiti and thus approached nation-building as a central military mission and who was "prepared to act while the civilian authority in Baghdad was still getting organized," according to Michael Gordon of The New York Times.[63] Some Iraqis gave Petraeus the nickname 'King David',[59][64] which was later adopted by some of his colleagues.[65][66][67] In 2004, Newsweek stated that "It's widely accepted that no force worked harder to win Iraqi hearts and minds than the 101st Air Assault Division led by Petraeus."[68]
One of the General's major public works was the restoration and re-opening of the University of Mosul.[69][70] Petraeus strongly supported the use of commanders' discretionary funds for public works, telling Coalition Provisional Authority director L. Paul Bremer "Money is ammunition" during the director's first visit to Mosul.[71][72] Petraeus' often repeated[73][74][75] catchphrase was later incorporated into official military briefings[76][77] and was also eventually incorporated into the U.S. Army Counterinsurgency Field Manual drafted with Petraeus' oversight.[78]
In February 2004, the 101st was replaced in Mosul by a portion of I Corps headquarters, but operational forces consisted solely of a unit roughly one quarter its size—a Stryker brigade. The following summer, the Governor of Nineveh Province was assassinated and most of the Sunni Arab Provincial Council members walked out in the ensuing selection of the new governor, leaving Kurdish members in charge of a predominantly Sunni Arab province. Later that year, the local police commander defected to the Kurdish Minister of Interior in Irbil after repeated assassination attempts against him, attacks on his house, and the kidnapping of his sister. The largely Sunni Arab police collapsed under insurgent attacks launched at the same time Coalition Forces attacked Fallujah in November 2004.
There are differing explanations for the apparent collapse of the police force in Mosul. The Guardian quoted an anonymous US diplomat saying "Mosul basically collapsed after he [Petraeus] left". Former diplomat Peter Galbraith criticized Petraeus' command of the 101st, saying his achievements have been exaggerated and his reputation is inflated. He wrote for The New York Review of Books that "Petraeus ignored warnings from America's Kurdish allies that he was appointing the wrong people to key positions in Mosul's local government and police."[79] On the other hand, in the book Fiasco, The Washington Post reporter Tom Ricks wrote that "Mosul was quiet while he (Petraeus) was there, and likely would have remained so had his successor had as many troops as he had—and as much understanding of counterinsurgency techniques." Ricks went on to say that "the population-oriented approach Petraeus took in Mosul in 2003 would be the one the entire U.S. Army in Iraq was trying to adopt in 2006."[80] Time columnist Joe Klein largely agreed with Ricks, writing that the Stryker brigade that replaced the 101st "didn't do any of the local governance that Petraeus had done". Moving away from counterinsurgency principles, "they were occupiers, not builders."[81] The New York Times reporter Michael Gordon and retired General Bernard Trainor echoed Ricks and Klein, including in their book Cobra II a quote that Petraeus "did it right and won over Mosul".[82]
In June 2004, less than six months after the 101st returned to the U.S., Petraeus was promoted to lieutenant general and became the first commander of the Multi-National Security Transition Command Iraq. This newly created command had responsibility for training, equipping, and mentoring Iraq's growing army, police, and other security forces as well as developing Iraq's security institutions and building associated infrastructure, such as training bases, police stations, and border forts. During Petraeus' fifteen months at the helm of MNSTC-I, he stood up a three-star command virtually from scratch and in the midst of serious fighting in places like Fallujah, Mosul, and Najaf. By the end of his command, some 100,000 Iraqi Security Forces had been trained; Iraqi Army and Police were being employed in combat; countless reconstruction projects had been executed; and hundreds of thousands of weapons, body armor, and other equipment had been distributed in what was described as the "largest military procurement and distribution effort since World War II", at a cost of over $11 billion.[83]
In September 2004, Petraeus wrote an article for The Washington Post in which he described the tangible progress being made in building Iraq's security forces from the ground up while also noting the many challenges associated with doing so. "Although there have been reverses – not to mention horrific terrorist attacks," Petraeus wrote, "there has been progress in the effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for their own security, something they are keen to do."[84] Some of the challenges involved in building security forces had to do with accomplishing this task in the midst of a tough insurgency—or, as Petraeus wrote, "making the mission akin to repairing an aircraft while in flight – and while being shot at". Other challenges included allegations of corruption as well as efforts to improve Iraq's supply accountability procedures. For example, according to former Interim Iraq Governing Council member Ali A. Allawi in The Occupation of Iraq: Winning the War, Losing the Peace, "under the very noses of the security transition command, officials both inside and outside the ministry of defense were planning to embezzle most, if not all, of the procurement budget of the army".[85] The Washington Post stated in August 2007 that the Pentagon had lost track of approximately 30% of weapons supplied to the Iraqi security forces. The General Accounting Office said that the weapons distribution was haphazard, rushed, and did not follow established procedures—particularly from 2004 to 2005, when security training was led by Petraeus and Iraq's security forces began to see combat in places like Najaf and Samarra.[86] Over a hundred thousand AK-47 assault rifles and pistols were delivered to Iraqi forces without full documentation, and some of the missing weapons may have been abducted by Iraqi insurgents.[87][88] Thousands of body armour pieces have also been lost.[89] The Independent has stated that the military believed "the situation on the ground was so urgent, and the agency responsible for recording the transfers of arms so short staffed, that field commanders had little choice in the matter."[90] The Pentagon conducted its own investigation, and accountability was subsequently regained for many of the weapons.[91]
Following his second tour in Iraq, Petraeus authored a widely read article in Military Review, listing fourteen observations he had made during two tours in Iraq, including: do not do too much with your own hands, money is ammunition, increasing the number of stakeholders is critical to success, success in a counterinsurgency requires more than just military operations, ultimate success depends on local leaders, there is no substitute for flexible and adaptable leaders, and, finally, a leader's most important task is to set the right tone.[92]
In January 2007, as part of his overhauled Iraq strategy, President George W. Bush announced that Petraeus would succeed Gen. George Casey as commanding general of MNF-I to lead all U.S. troops in Iraq. On January 23, the Senate Armed Services Committee held Petraeus' nomination hearing, during which he testified on his ideas for Iraq, particularly the strategy underpinning the "surge" of forces. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that "security of the population, especially in Baghdad, and in partnership with the Iraqi Security Forces, will be the focus of the military effort." He went on to state that security will require establishing a persistent presence, especially in Iraq's most threatened neighborhoods. He also noted the critical importance of helping Iraq increase its governmental capacity, develop employment programs, and improve daily life for its citizens.[93]
Throughout Petraeus' tenure in Iraq, Multi-National Force-Iraq endeavored to work with the Government of Iraq to carry out this strategy that focuses on securing the population. Doing so required establishing—and maintaining—persistent presence by living among the population, separating reconcilable Iraqis from irreconcilable enemies, relentlessly pursuing the enemy, taking back sanctuaries and then holding areas that have been cleared, and continuing to develop Iraq's security forces and to support local security forces, often called Sons of Iraq, and to integrate them into the Iraqi Army and Police and other employment programs.[94][95][96]
The strategy underpinning the "surge" of forces, as well as the ideas Petraeus included in US army Field Manual 3–24, Counterinsurgency, have been referred to by some journalists and politicians as the "Petraeus Doctrine," although the surge itself was proposed a few months before Petraeus took command. Despite the misgivings of most Democratic and a few Republican senators over the proposed implementation of the "Petraeus Doctrine" in Iraq, specifically regarding the troop surge, Petraeus was unanimously confirmed as a four-star general and MNF-I commander on January 27.[97][98]
Before leaving for Iraq, Petraeus recruited a number of highly educated military officers, nicknamed "Petraeus guys" or "designated thinkers", to advise him as commander, including Col. Mike Meese, head of the Social Sciences Department at West Point and Col. H.R. McMaster, famous for his leadership at the Battle of 73 Easting in the Gulf War and in the pacification of Tal Afar more recently, as well as for his doctoral dissertation on Vietnam-era civil-military relations entitled Dereliction of Duty. While most of Petraeus' closest advisers are American military officers, he also hired Lt. Col. David Kilcullen of the Australian Army, who was working for the US State Department.[99] Kilcullen upon his return from Iraq published The Accidental Guerrilla,[100] and has discussed the central front of the war and lessons learned in Iraq in The Washington Post.[101]
U.S. Army Gen. David H. Petraeus, the commander of Multi-National Force – Iraq, briefs reporters at the Pentagon April 26, 2007, on his view of the current military situation in Iraq.
After taking command of MNF-I on February 10, 2007, Petraeus inspected U.S. and Iraqi units all over Iraq, visiting outposts in greater Baghdad, Tikrit, Baquba, Ramadi, Mosul, Kirkuk, Bayji, Samarra, Basrah and as far west as al-Hit and Al Qaim. In April 2007, Petraeus made his first visit to Washington as MNF-I Commander, reporting to President Bush and Congress on the progress of the "surge" and the overall situation in Iraq. During this visit he met privately with members of Congress and reportedly argued against setting a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq.[102]
By late May 2007, Congress did not impose any timetables in war funding legislation for troop withdrawal.[103] The enacted legislation did mandate that Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, deliver a report to Congress by September 15, 2007, detailing their assessment of the military, economic and political situation of Iraq.
In June 2007, Petraeus stated in an interview that there were "astonishing signs of normalcy" in Baghdad, and this comment drew criticism from Senate majority leader Harry Reid. In the same interview, however, Petraeus stated that "many problems remain" and he noted the need to help the Iraqis "stitch back together the fabric of society that was torn during the height of sectarian violence" in late 2006.[104] Petraeus also warned that he expected that the situation in Iraq would require the continued deployment of the elevated troop level of more than 150,000 beyond September 2007; he also stated that U.S. involvement in Iraq could last years afterward.[105] These statements are representative of the fact that throughout their time in Iraq, Petraeus and Crocker remained circumspect and refused to classify themselves as optimists or pessimists, noting, instead, that they were realists and that the reality in Iraq was very hard. They also repeatedly emphasized the importance of forthright reports and an unvarnished approach.[106][107] "Indeed, Petraeus' realistic approach and assessments were lauded during the McLaughlin Group's 2008 Year-End Awards, when Monica Crowley nominated Petraeus for the most honest person of the year, stating, "...[H]e spoke about the great successes of the surge in Iraq, but he always tempered it, never sugar-coated it."[108]
In July 2007, the White House submitted to Congress the interim report on Iraq, which stated that coalition forces had made satisfactory progress on 6 of 18 benchmarks set by Congress. On September 7, 2007, in a letter addressed to the troops he was commanding, Petraeus wrote that much military progress had been made, but that the national level political progress that was hoped for had not been achieved.[109] Petraeus' Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq was delivered to Congress on September 10, 2007.
On August 15, 2007, the Los Angeles Times stated that, according to unnamed administration officials, the report "would actually be written by the White House, with inputs from officials throughout the government".[110] However, Petraeus declared in his testimony to Congress that "I wrote this testimony myself." He further elaborated that his testimony to Congress "has not been cleared by, nor shared with, anyone in the Pentagon, the White House, or Congress".[111][112]

In his September Congressional testimony, Petraeus stated that "As a bottom line up front, the military objectives of the surge are, in large measure, being met." He cited numerous factors for this progress, to include the fact that Coalition and Iraqi Forces had dealt significant blows to Al-Qaeda Iraq and had disrupted Shia militias, that ethno-sectarian violence had been reduced, and that the tribal rejection of Al-Qaeda had spread from Anbar Province to numerous other locations across Iraq. Based on this progress and additional progress expected to be achieved, Petraeus recommended drawing down the surge forces from Iraq and gradually transitioning increased responsibilities to Iraqi Forces, as their capabilities and conditions on the ground permitted.[113]
Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada argued Petraeus' "plan is just more of the same" and "is neither a drawdown or a change in mission that we need". Democratic Representative Robert Wexler of Florida accused Petraeus of "cherry-picking statistics" and "massaging information".[114] Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Lantos of California called the General and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker "Two of our nation's most capable public servants" and said Democrats feel "esteem for their professionalism". He also said that "We can no longer take their assertions on Iraq at face value"; concluding, "We need to get out of Iraq, for that country's sake as well as our own."[115]
Republican Presidential candidate Duncan Hunter called the report "a candid, independent assessment given with integrity".[116] Republican Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona stated that "I commend General Petraeus for his honest and forthright assessment of the situation in Iraq."[117] Anti-war Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska criticized the report while praising Petraeus, saying "It's not your fault, general... It's not Ambassador Crocker's fault. It's this administration's fault."[118] A USA Today/Gallup poll taken after Petraeus' report to Congress showed virtually no change in public opinion toward the war.[119] A Pew Research Center survey found that most Americans who have heard about the report approve of Petraeus' recommendations.[120]
On September 20, the Senate passed an amendment by Republican John Cornyn III of Texas designed to "strongly condemn personal attacks on the honor and integrity of General Petraeus". Cornyn drafted the amendment in response to a controversial full-page ad by the liberal group Moveon.org in the September 10, 2007, edition of The New York Times. All forty-nine Republican Senators and twenty-two Democratic Senators voted in support.[121] The House passed a similar resolution by a 341–79 vote on September 26.
In December 2007, The Washington Post's "Fact Checker" stated that "While some of Petraeus's statistics are open to challenge, his claims about a general reduction in violence have been borne out over subsequent months. It now looks as if Petraeus was broadly right on this issue at least".[122]
Based on the conditions on the ground, in October 2007, Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker revised their campaign plan for Iraq. In recognition of the progress made against Al Qaeda Iraq, one of the major points would be "shifting the U.S. military effort to focus more on countering Shiite militias".[123]
On February 18, 2008, USA Today stated that "the U.S. effort has shown more success" and that, after the number of troops reached its peak in fall 2007, "U.S. deaths were at their lowest levels since the 2003 invasion, civilian casualties were down, and street life was resuming in Baghdad."[124] In light of the significant reduction in violence and as the surge brigades began to redeploy without replacement, Petraeus characterized the progress as tenuous, fragile, and reversible and repeatedly reminded all involved that much work remains to be done.[125][126] During an early February trip to Iraq, Defense Secretary Robert Gates endorsed the idea of a period of consolidation and evaluation upon completion of the withdrawal of surge brigades from Iraq.[127]
Petraeus and Crocker continued these themes at their two full days of testimony before Congress on April 8 and 9th. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that "there has been significant but uneven security progress in Iraq," while also noting that "the situation in certain areas is still unsatisfactory and that innumerable challenges remain" and that "the progress made since last spring is fragile and reversible." He also recommended a continuation of the drawdown of surge forces as well as a 45-day period of consolidation and evaluation after the final surge brigade has redeployed in late July.[128] Analysts for USA Today and The New York Times stated that the hearings "lacked the suspense of last September's debate," but they did include sharp questioning as well as both skepticism and praise from various Congressional leaders.[129][130]
In late May 2008, the Senate Armed Services Committee held nomination hearings for Petraeus and Lieutenant General Ray Odierno to lead United States Central Command and Multi-National Force-Iraq, respectively. During the hearings, Committee Chairman Carl Levin praised these two men, stating that "we owe Gen. Petraeus and Gen. Odierno a debt of gratitude for the commitment, determination and strength that they brought to their areas of responsibility. And regardless of how long the administration may choose to remain engaged in the strife in that country, our troops are better off with the leadership these two distinguished soldiers provide."[131] During his opening statement, Petraeus discussed four principles that would guide his efforts if confirmed as CENTCOM Commander: seeking to strengthen international partnerships; taking a "whole of government" approach; pursuing comprehensive efforts and solutions; and, finally, both supporting efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan and ensuring readiness for possible contingency operations in the future. Petraeus also noted that during the week before his testimony, the number of security incidents in Iraq was the lowest in over four years.[132] After Petraeus' return to Baghdad, and despite the continued drawdown of surge forces as well as recent Iraqi-led operations in places like Basrah, Mosul, and Baghdad, the number of security incidents in Iraq remained at their lowest level in over four years.[133]

In September 2008, Petraeus gave an interview to BBC News stating that he did not think using the term "victory" in describing the Iraq war was appropriate, saying "This is not the sort of struggle where you take a hill, plant the flag and go home to a victory parade... it's not war with a simple slogan."[134]
Petraeus had discussed the term 'victory' before in March 2008, saying to NPR News that "an Iraq that is at peace with itself, at peace with its neighbors, that has a government that is representative of—and responsive to—its citizenry and is a contributing member of the global community" could arguably be called 'victory'.[135] On the eve of his change of command, in September 2008, Petraeus stated that "I don't use terms like victory or defeat... I'm a realist, not an optimist or a pessimist. And the reality is that there has been significant progress but there are still serious challenges."[136]

On September 16, 2008, Petraeus formally gave over his command in Iraq to General Raymond T. Odierno in a government ceremony presided by Defense Secretary Robert Gates.[136] During the ceremony, Gates stated that Petraeus "played a historic role" and created the "translation of a great strategy into a great success in very difficult circumstances". Gates also told Petraeus he believed "history will regard you as one of our nation's greatest battle captains."[136] He presented Petraeus with the Defense Distinguished Service Medal.[136] At the event, Petraeus mentioned the difficulty in getting the Sons of Iraq absorbed in the central Government of Iraq and warned about future consequences if the effort stalls.[136] Indeed, when speaking of these and other challenges, Petraeus is the first to note that "the gains [achieved in Iraq] are tenuous and unlikely to survive without an American effort that outlasts his tenure". Even so, as Petraeus departed Iraq, it was clear to all that he was leaving a much different Iraq than the one that existed when he took command in February 2007. As described by Dexter Filkins, "violence has plummeted from its apocalyptic peaks, Iraqi leaders are asserting themselves, and streets that once seemed dead are flourishing with life."[137] This is also illustrated by the Iraq Trends charts that the MNF-I produces weekly. The January 3, 2009, "Iraq Trends Chart" clearly depicts over time, the increases in incidents followed by the sharp decline as described by Dexter Filkens and others.
General Petraeus' critical role in Iraq has been widely acknowledged by commands of the coalition forces. In her introduction of Petraeus at the Baccalaureate ceremony for the Class of 2009, Princeton University President Shirley Tilghman described his accomplishments. While acknowledging that much remains to be accomplished in Iraq, Tilghman paid tribute to Petraeus' "leadership in rethinking American military strategy through his principles of counterinsurgency," which are, she said, "eliminating 'simplistic definitions of victory and defeat in favor of incremental and nuanced progress'."[138]
On October 31, 2008, Petraeus assumed command of the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) headquartered in Tampa, Florida. Petraeus was responsible for U.S. operations in 20 countries spreading from Egypt to Pakistan—including Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. During his time at CENTCOM, Petraeus advocated that countering the terrorist threats in the CENTCOM region requires more than just counter-terrorism forces, demanding instead whole-of-governments, comprehensive approaches akin to those of counterinsurgency.[139] Petraeus reiterated this view in a 2009 interview published in Parade magazine.[140] In a recent interview for Newsweek magazine's "Interview Issue: The View From People Who Make a Difference", Petraeus expressed his support for President Obama's announced Afghanistan strategy and discussed his view that reconciliation efforts in Afghanistan should for the time being occur "at the lower and midlevels".[141]
In mid-August 2009, Petraeus established the Afghanistan-Pakistan Center of Excellence within the USCENTCOM Directorate of Intelligence to provide leadership to coordinate, integrate and focus analysis efforts in support of operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan.[142]
On March 16, 2010, testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Petraeus described the continuing Israeli–Palestinian conflict as a challenge to U.S. interests in the region. According to the testimony, the conflict was "fomenting anti-American sentiment" due to "a perception of U.S. favoritism for Israel". This was widely commented on in the media.[143][144][145][146] When questioned by journalist Philip Klein, Petraeus said the original reporter "picked apart" and "spun" his speech. He believes there are many important factors standing in the way of peace, including "a whole bunch of extremist organizations, some of which by the way deny Israel's right to exist. There's a country that has a nuclear program who denies that the Holocaust took place. So again we have all these factors in there. This [Israel] is just one."[147][148]
In March 2010, Petraeus visited the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College to speak about Iraq and Afghanistan.[149] Petraeus spoke a few days after the seventh anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, noting the successful changes in Iraq since the U.S. troop surge. The visit to Saint Anselm created rumors that Petraeus was contemplating a run for the Presidency; however, he denied the speculation saying that he was not aware that the college has been the site of numerous presidential debates.[150]
Toward the close of his tenure as CENTCOM Commander, including in his interview published in Vanity Fair, Petraeus discussed the effort to determine and send to Afghanistan the right "inputs" for success there; these inputs include several structures and organizations that proved important in Iraq, including "an engagement cell to support reconciliation...a finance cell to go after financing of the enemy...[a] really robust detainee-operations task force, a rule-of-law task force, an energy-fusion cell – all these other sort of nonstandard missions that are very important."[151]
On May 5, 2010, the New York Times published an article that there was mounting evidence of a Taliban role in the Times Square bombing plot.[152] On May 7, 2010, Petraeus announced that Times Square bombing suspect, Faisal Shahzad, is a "lone wolf" terrorist who did not work with others.[153] On May 10, 2010, Attorney General Eric Holder said that the evidence shows the Pakistani Taliban directed this plot.[154]
On June 23, 2010, President Obama announced that he would nominate Petraeus to succeed General Stanley A. McChrystal as the commander of U.S. Forces in Afghanistan. The change of command was prompted by McChrystal's comments about the Obama administration and its policies in Afghanistan during an interview with Rolling Stone magazine.[15] The nomination was technically a positional step down from his position as commander of Central Command, however the President said that he believed that he was the best man for the job. After being confirmed by the Senate on June 30,[51] Petraeus formally assumed command on July 4.[155] During the assumption of command remarks,[156] Petraeus provided his vision and goals to NATO, the members of his command, and his Afghan partners. As he was known to do while the Commander in Iraq, Petraeus delivered his first Letter to the Troops[157] on the same day he assumed command.[158]
On August 1, 2010, shortly after the disclosure of the Afghan war logs on Wikileaks, Petraeus issued his updated Tactical Directive for the prevention of civilian casualties, providing guidance and intent for the use of force by the U.S. military units operating in Afghanistan (replacing the July 1, 2009 version). This directive reinforced the concept of "disciplined use of force in partnership with Afghan Security Forces" in the fight against insurgent forces.
We must never forget that the center of gravity in this struggle is the Afghan people; it is they who will ultimately determine the future of Afghanistan ... Prior to the use of fires, the commander approving the strike must determine that no civilians are present. If unable to assess the risk of civilian presence, fires are prohibited, except under of the following two conditions (specific conditions deleted due to operational security; however, they have to do with the risk to ISAF and Afghan forces).[159]
In the October 2010 issue of Army Magazine, Petraeus discussed changes that had taken place over the previous 18 months, including sections discussing "setting the conditions for progress", "capitalizing on the conditions for progress", "improving security", "supporting governance expansion", "promoting economic development", "reducing corruption", and "our troopers: carrying out a difficult mission".[160]
In early March 2011, Petraeus made a "rare apology" following a NATO helicopter airstrike under his command which resulted in the deaths of nine Afghan boys and the wounding of a 10th, as they gathered firewood in Eastern Afghanistan. In a statement, Petraeus apologized to the members of the Afghan government, the people of Afghanistan and the surviving family members, and said: "These deaths should have never happened." Several journalists and observers noted the humanitarian candor in Petraeus' open regrets.[161][162] Petraeus relinquished command of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan on July 18.[163] He received the Defense Distinguished Service Medal and the NATO Meritorious Service Medal for his service.
Petraeus retired from the U.S. Army on August 31, 2011. His retirement ceremony was held at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall.[164] During this ceremony, he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal by Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn.[165] During the ceremony, Lynn in his remarks noted that, General Petraeus has played an important role as both a combat leader and strategist in the post-9/11 world. Lynn also cited General Petraeus' efforts in current counter insurgency strategy.[166] Admiral Michael Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in his remarks compared General Petraeus to Ulysses S. Grant, John J. Pershing, George Marshall and Dwight D. Eisenhower as one of the great battle captains of American history.[167] For his 38 years of service Petraeus receives a $220,000 annual pension.[168]
On April 28, 2011, President Barack Obama announced that he had nominated Petraeus to become the new Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.[169] The nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate 94–0 on June 30, 2011.[170] Petraeus was sworn in at the White House on September 6[171] and then ceremonially sworn in by Vice President Joe Biden at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia on October 11, 2011.[172]
Petraeus' tenure at the CIA was more low profile than that of his predecessor, Leon Panetta, declining to give media interviews while Director and speaking to Congress in closed sessions. He also differed from Panetta in management style, as an article in The New York Times published just days before his resignation said Panetta "wooed the work force and often did not question operational details, [while] Petraeus is a demanding boss who does not hesitate to order substandard work redone or details of plans adjusted."[173]
Although Petraeus was given good marks by most observers for his work heading the CIA,[173] during October 2012 some critics took issue with the availability of accurate information from the CIA concerning a terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, the month prior. On September 11 four Americans had been killed, including the Ambassador, and more than thirty evacuated. Only seven of those evacuated did not work for the CIA. According to a Wall Street Journal story, other government agencies complained about being left "largely in the dark about the CIA's role," with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton telephoning Petraeus directly the night of the attacks seeking assistance. Although the "State Department believed it had a formal agreement with the CIA to provide backup security," "the CIA didn't have the same understanding about its security responsibilities," said the Wall Street Journal.[174]
According to Petraeus associate Steven A. Boylan, Petraeus began an affair with Paula Broadwell, principal author of his biography, All In: The Education of General David Petraeus, in late 2011 when he was no longer an active duty military officer. Petraeus reportedly ended the affair in the summer of 2012, around the time that he learned that Broadwell had been sending harassing emails to a longstanding family friend of the Petraeuses, Jill Kelley.[175]
Kelley, a Florida socialite who frequently entertained senior military personnel at her and her husband's Tampa mansion,[176] had approached an acquaintance who worked for the FBI Tampa Field Office in the late spring with regard to anonymous emails she considered threatening.[175] The Bureau traced the emails to Broadwell, and noted that Broadwell appeared to be exchanging intimate messages with an email account belonging to Petraeus, which instigated an investigation into whether that account had been hacked into or was someone posing as Petraeus.[177][178][179] According to an Associated Press report, rather than transmit emails to each other's inbox, which would have left a more obvious email trail, Petraeus and Broadwell left messages in a draft folder and the draft messages were then read by the other person when they logged into the same account.[180]
Although US Attorney General Eric Holder was aware that the FBI had discovered the affair,[181] it was not until November 6, 2012, that Petraeus' nominal superior, Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper, was advised. That same evening Clapper called Petraeus and urged him to resign. Clapper notified the White House the next day, November 7. After being briefed on November 8, President Obama summoned Petraeus to the White House where Petraeus offered his resignation.[182] Obama accepted his resignation on November 9,[183][184] and Petraeus cited his affair when announcing that same day that he would resign as CIA Director.[185]
Petraeus had a strategy to influence military conditions by using the press relations effectively in the theater and in Washington, according to critics who assessed the general's military career after his fall from power. On November 13, 2012, Lawrence Korb, Ray McGovern, and Gareth Porter appearing on Al Jazeera English assessed the general's extensive military-media strategy linking his writings on counterguerrilla operations and subsequent military media efforts to his downfall with a female biographer. Critics observed that the Petraeus media strategy would prove damaging for American policy in the future because of the omissions and distorted interpretations that Washington policymakers, other experts, and the American public accepted from the highly effective Petraeus media contacts.[186]
Military historians have noted the absence of field records for the Iraq and Afghanistan military campaigns, but have not personally been critical of the commanders in theater.[187] One additional aspect of Petraeus' career that has come under increased scrutiny since his affair came to light has been his lack of a direct combat record in relation to the many awards he received. In particular, his Bronze Star Medal with Valor device has been mentioned in several media reports and questioned by several former Army officers.[188] Counter to what many may think or believe, those comments were refuted by the accounts of Petraeus' actions during the Battles of Najaf, Karbala, and Hillah by Rick Atkinson, the three-time Pulitzer Prize winning author who rode with Petraeus during the initial fight to Baghdad in March–April 2003 and whose book "In the Company of Soldiers" describes that time (e.g., pages 263-271, which describe bullets whistling overhead and ricocheting around Petraeus). The citation for Petraeus' Bronze Star w/"V" device also notes his 'leadership under fire,' and the award of the Combat Action Badge reflects the same.

On March 28, 2013, Petraeus joined the American Corporate Partners (ACP), a national nonprofit organization that connects post-9/11 veterans to business professionals for career guidance. In March 2013, Petraeus has accepted the role of Honorary Chairmen of the OSS Society.[189]
Petraeus was named a visiting professor at Macaulay Honors College at the City University of New York (CUNY) in July 2013. According to a statement from Petraeus, "I look forward to leading a seminar at Macaulay that examines the developments that could position the United States - and our North American partners - to lead the world out of the current global economic slowdown."[190] After his anticipated $200,000 salary for the academic year drew fire from critics, Petraeus agreed to take on the teaching position for just $1 in order to keep the focus on the students and away from any monetary controversy.[191] In September 2013 Petraeus was harassed by students at CUNY while walking on campus.[192]
On May 1, 2013, the University of Southern California named Petraeus as a Judge Widney Professor, "a title reserved for eminent individuals from the arts, sciences, professions, business and community and national leadership."[193] The president of the Currahee Board of Trustees announced May 6, 2013, that Petraeus agreed to serve on the board of trustees that preserves Camp Toccoa. During WWII, four of the main parachute infantry regiments of the Army trained at Camp Toccoa prior to their deployment.[194]
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., a New York investment firm, hired Petraeus as chairman of the firm's newly created KKR Global Institute in May 2013. Petraeus will support its investment teams and portfolio companies when studying new investments, especially in new locations.[195]
Team Rubicon, an organization that focuses[clarification needed] individuals with military experience and first responders to deploy emergency response teams announced on June 18, 2013, that Petraeus has joined its board of advisors.[196]
Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) named Petraeus as a Senior Vice President of the organization in August 2013. According to RUSI, "The honorary role was created by RUSI's trustees and advisory council in recognition of General Petraeus' long association with the Institute and his distinguished contribution to the study and development of defence and international security concepts, as well as his implementation of those concepts in operations in the Balkans, Iraq, and Afghanistan".[197]
In October, Petraeus joined the Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government as a non-resident senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. According to the school, Petraeus will jointly lead a new project focusing on the technological, scientific and economic dynamics that are spurring renewed North American competitiveness. "The Coming North America Decades" project will analyze how potential policy choices could effect this ongoing transformation.[198]
On February 10, 2014, the University of Exeter in England named Petraeus as an Honorary Visiting Professor of the Strategy and Security Institute. Alongside the other honorary faculty, the appointment will help inform the Institute's key objectives of exploring policymaking, strategy, and security.[199]
General Petraeus was diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer in February 2009 and underwent two months of successful radiation treatment at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.[200] The diagnosis and treatment was not publicly disclosed until October 2009 because Petraeus and his family regarded his illness as a personal matter that did not interfere with the performance of his duties.[201]
On June 15, 2010, Petraeus momentarily fainted while being questioned by the Senate Armed Services Committee. He quickly recovered and was able to walk and exit the room without assistance.[202] He attributed the episode to possible dehydration.
In 2007, Time named Petraeus one of the 100 most influential leaders and revolutionaries of the year as well as one of its four runners up for Time Person of the Year.[212][213] He was also named the second most influential American conservative by The Daily Telegraph[214] as well as The Daily Telegraph's 2007 Man of the Year.[215][216] In 2005, Petraeus was identified as one of America's top leaders by U.S. News & World Report.[217]
In 2008, a poll conducted by Foreign Policy and Prospect magazines selected Petraeus as one of the world's top 100 public intellectuals.[218] Also in 2008, the Static Line Association named Petraeus as its 2008 Airborne Man of the Year, and Der Spiegel named him "America's most respected soldier."[219] As 2008 came to a close, Newsweek named him the 16th most powerful person in the world in its December 20, 2008, edition,[220] and Prospect magazine named him the "Public Intellectual of the Year".[221] He was also named as one of the "75 Best People in the World" in the October 2009 issue of Esquire,[222]
The OSS Society awarded Petraeus its Donovan Award May 2, 2009. In his introduction of Petraeus, Maj. Gen. John K. Singlub, USA, Ret., a 2007 award recipient and OSS Society chairman, said "The William J. Donovan Award is given to an individual who has rendered distinguished service in the interests of the democratic process, public service, courage in all its forms and the cause of freedom."[223] The National Committee on American Foreign Policy (NCAFP) during its 35th Anniversary Gala and Award Dinner on May 28, 2009 in New York City, presented the George F. Kennan Award for Distinguished Public Service to Petraeus.[224] The American Legion awarded its highest honor, the Distinguished Service Medal on August 25, 2009 at its 91st National Convention in Louisville, Kentucky.[225]
On February 20, 2010, Petraeus received Princeton University's Madison Medal, named after the fourth president of the United States, who many[who?] consider to be Princeton's first graduate student. Established by the Association of Princeton Graduate Alumni, it is presented each year by the University to an alumnus or alumna of the Graduate School who has had a distinguished career, advanced the cause of graduate education or achieved an outstanding record of public service.[226] May 27, 2010, The Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum awarded its Freedom Award to Petraeus. "The Intrepid Museum's mission is to honor the men and women who have served our nation. General Petraeus has led our troops overseas in that exact effort, and we are indebted to his leadership and love of country", said Susan Marenoff, Executive Director of the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum. "This annual event throws a spotlight on individuals who have gone above and beyond the call of duty for our nation."[227] On September 20, the American Political Science Association (APSA) presented Petraeus with its 2010 Hubert H. Humphrey Award in recognition of notable public service by a political scientist.[228] On December 9, 2010, Barbara Walters picked Petraeus for the Most Fascinating Person of 2010. Walters called the top commander in Afghanistan "an American hero".[229] Petraeus was chosen as "one of Time magazine's 50 "People Who Mattered" in December 2010.[230] The same year he was named number 12 of 50 people who mattered in 2010 by the New Statesmen magazine,[231] and Petraeus was listed as number 8 of 100 Foreign Policy Top 100 Global Thinkers for 2011.[232]
Early January 2011, Pete Hegseth and Wade Zirkle from Vets for Freedom, wrote an Op-Ed for the Wall Street Journal making a claim that Petraeus should be promoted to Five-Star which would make him General of the Army.[233] In April, Petraeus was named in the 2011 Time 100.[234] The Institute for the Study of War, 2011, National Security Leadership Award was presented to Petraeus on August 4, 2011. The New Statesman annual survey presents the most influential people from pop stars and dissident activists to tech gurus and heads of state, the people doing most to shape our world keep changing.

According to de Maizière, he is an "outstanding strategist and a true friend of the German people."[239] On March 16, 2012, the Dutch Minister of Defense Hans Hillen knighted Petraeus at the Hague with the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Orange Nassau with swords. The Minister thanked Petraeus in his speech for his, "unconditional support to the Dutch troops and for being a driving force behind a successful mission. Through his personal efforts for cooperation between the Netherlands and America, the Netherlands could achieve significant operational successes with the Task Force Uruzgan."[240]
Captured correspondence from Osama Bin Laden "Letters from Abbottabad"[241] revealed that in May 2010, Bin Laden wanted to target President Barack Obama and General Petraeus, "The reason for concentrating on them is that Obama is the head of infidelity and killing him automatically will make Biden take over the presidency for the remainder of the term, as it is the norm over there. Biden is totally unprepared for that post, which will lead the U.S. into a crisis." It further went on to say, "As for Petraeus, he is the man of the hour in this last year of the war, and killing him would alter the war's path."[242]
The Command and General Staff College Foundation's 2012 Distinguished Leadership Award was presented to Petraeus on May 10, 2012.[243] Petraeus was a recipient of the 2012 Jefferson Award for Public Service, which was presented on June 19, 2012, at a Washington D.C luncheon.[244] The Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) presented Petraeus with its Patriot Award during the 121st Continental Congress held in DAR Constitution Hall.

	General David H. Petraeus assumed command of the NATO International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and U.S. Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A) on July 4, 2010 after serving for over 20 months as Commander, United States Central Command.
	Before his assignment as CENTCOM Commander, General Petraeus commanded Multi-National Force-Iraq where he led US and Coalition Forces during “the surge.”  Prior to his tour as MNF-I Commander, he commanded the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center and Fort Leavenworth, during which time he oversaw the development of the Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Manual.  Before that assignment, he served for over 15 months as the first Commander of the Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq and the NATO Training Mission-Iraq.  That deployment to Iraq followed his command of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), during which he led the “Screaming Eagles” in combat during the fight to Baghdad and throughout the first year of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  His command of the 101st followed a year deployed on Operation Joint Forge in Bosnia, where he was the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations of the NATO Stabilization Force and the Deputy Commander of the US Joint Counter-Terrorism Task Force-Bosnia. Prior to his tour in Bosnia, he spent two years at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, serving first as the Assistant Division Commander for Operations of the 82nd Airborne Division and then as the Chief of Staff of XVIII Airborne Corps. 
	General Petraeus was commissioned in the Infantry upon graduation as a “distinguished cadet” from the United States Military Academy in 1974.  In addition to the posts noted above, he subsequently held leadership positions in airborne, mechanized, and air assault infantry units in Europe, the United States, and the Middle East, including command of a battalion in the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) and a brigade in the 82nd Airborne Division.  In addition, he served in a number of staff assignments:  Aide to the Chief of Staff of the Army; battalion, brigade, and division operations officer; Military Assistant to the Supreme Allied Commander-Europe; Chief of Operations of the United Nations Force in Haiti; and Executive Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
	General Petraeus was the General George C. Marshall Award winner as the top graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College Class of 1983.  He subsequently earned MPA and Ph.D. degrees in international relations from Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, and he later served as an Assistant Professor of International Relations at the US Military Academy.  He also completed a fellowship at Georgetown University.
	Awards and decorations earned by General Petraeus include two awards of the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, two awards of the Distinguished Service Medal, the Bronze Star Medal for valor, the State Department Distinguished Service Award, the NATO Meritorious Service Medal, the Gold Award of the Iraqi Order of the Date Palm, the French Légion d’Honneur, the Polish Order of Merit, the Order of Australia, and the National Defense Cross of the Czech Republic.  He is a Master Parachutist and Air Assault and Ranger qualified.  He has also earned the Combat Action Badge and French, British, and German Jump Wings.  In 2005 he was recognized by the U.S. News and World Report as one of America’s 25 Best Leaders, and in 2007 he was one of four runners-up for Time Person of the Year.  In 2009, he was selected by Foreign Policy magazine as one of the world’s top 100 public intellectuals and by Esquire magazine as one of the 75 Most Influential People of the 21st Century.  Most recently, he was awarded the George Kennan Award by the National Committee on American Foreign Policy and the 2010 James Madison Medal by Princeton University.

 General David Petraeus is the most transformative leader the American military has seen since the generation of Marshall. In the New York Times bestseller All In, military expert Paula Broadwell examines Petraeus's career, his intellectual development as a military officer, and his impact on the U.S. military.Afforded extensive access by General Petraeus, his mentors, his subordinates, and his longtime friends, Broadwell reported on the front lines of fighting and at the strategic command in Afghanistan to chronicle the experiences of this American general as they were brought to bear in the terrible crucible of war. All In draws on hundreds of hours of exclusive interviews with Petraeus and his top officers and soldiers to tell the inside story of this commander's development and leadership in war. When Petraeus assumed command in Afghanistan in July 2010, the conflict looked as bleak as at any moment in America's nine years on the ground there. Petraeus's defining idea—counterinsurgency—was immediate put to its most difficult test: the hard lessons learned during the surge in Iraq were to be applied in a radically different theater. All In examines the impact in Afghanistan of new counterinsurgency as well as counterterrorism strategies through the commands of several Petraeus protégés. Broadwell examines his evolution as a solider from his education at West Point in the wake of Vietnam to his earlier service in Central America, Haiti, Kuwait, Bosnia, and Iraq. All In also documents the general's role in the war in Washington, going behind the scenes of negotiations during policy reviews of the war in Afghanistan in Congress, the Pentagon, and the White House. Broadwell ultimately appraises Petraeus's impact on the entire U.S. military: Thanks to this man's influence, the military is better prepared to fight using a comprehensive blend of civil-military activities. As America surveys a decade of untraditional warfare, this much is clear: The career of General David Petraeus profoundly shaped our military and left an indelible mark on its rising leaders.

"A valuable perspective on how Gen. Petraeus—the most successful U.S. general of his generation—approached the war in Afghanistan... It is, in fact, probably the best depiction yet of Gen. Petraeus's management style." —The Wall Street Journal "General Petraeus is one of the most important Americans of our time, in or out of uniform. This riveting, insider's account of his life and education is at once instructive and inspiring." —Tom Brokaw, Anchor and Managing Editor, NBC Nightly News; author of The Greatest Generation "This majestic biography will set the standard for all future works about General Petraeus. With superb narrative skill, Broadwell simultaneously provides an intimate look at Petraeus the man, a fascinating account of modern warfare, and an elegant study of leadership." —Doris Kearns Goodwin, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of No Ordinary Time "Teddy Roosevelt once said that it is not enough to be intelligent; a leader must also be honest and fearless. In General David Petraeus (himself a T.R. fan), America has been fortunate to have a soldier-scholar who is all three. Paula Broadwell, soldier-scholar in her own right, tells the Petraeus story masterfully, providing especially rich detail and insight into his Afghanistan mission. This book helps us understand how Petraeus has become the living legend he is." —David Gergen, author of Eyewitness to Power "This is the best book yet on General David Petraeus, written by a remarkable former Army officer who spent months on the ground in Afghanistan herself. Paula Broadwell captures his basic tenets of counterinsurgency and basic approach to leadership—as well as Petraeus's personal qualities and character—in a highly readable and pithy fashion. No one gives a truer picture of the war, or of the finest general of this era and one of the greatest in modern American history." —Michael O'Hanlon, Senior Fellow, the Brookings Institution "All In vividly demonstrates the influence General David Petraeus has had on a whole generation of military officers-showing by the force of his personal example what it means to be tough, loyal, committed, and smart. Paula Broadwell takes readers into the briefing rooms and onto the battlefields to better understand the lessons and sacrifices of America's wars." —Nathaniel Fick, New York Times bestselling author of One Bullet Away "Anyone seeking to understand the nature of American warfighting in the 21st century, how it is both like and utterly unlike that of any previous one, needs to understand Petraeus, his remarkable career, his thinking, and his character. All In is an excellent place to start. It is fascinating and insightful, informed by remarkable access to the man both on and off the battlefield." —Mark Bowden, author of Black Hawk Down "There have been several books written about parts of the career of David Petraeus, but this is the first one that could be called a biography of the most prominent American general since World War II. It is written with an insider's lively understanding of the workings of today's Army. I've known David Petraeus since he was a colonel and written two books in which he appeared, but I still learned a lot about him from this book. All In feels at times like we are sitting at his side in Afghanistan, reading his e-mails over his shoulder." —Thomas E. Ricks, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Generals, Fiasco, and The Gamble "Broadwell's excellent biography portrays [Petraeus] as a modern exemplar of the soldier-scholar-statesman and one who has exerted a profound influence on the American military establishment." —Mackubin Thomas Owens, Foreign Affairs
Paula Broadwell served in the military for over a decade and has more than fifteen years experience in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency. She lives in Charlotte, North Carolina.   Vernon Loeb is the metro editor at the Washington Post.

  I have to say this book really left a lot to be desired.  Paula Broadwell tried to tell one good story I am sure but she failed and instead told several bad ones.  There is no cohesion to this story and instead we see a mishmash of bad ones. We are mislead by the title.  The book really doesn't do a good job explaining Petraeus or his command style.  We see a confusing mix of a biography, a first hand account of the ground situation in Afghanistan and then a view of the struggles winning the hearts and minds of the Afghani people.This book lacks vision and really doesn't tell the reader anything earth shattering or more depth than one could find by reading Time or watching CNN.  There is nothing new under the sun here.  Seriously, don't waste your time no matter what the professional critics say.
  Much wasn't really brought to light or revealed here. One never gets a sense about how Petraeus makes judgements, where he failed and would have done better, or has any insight into him and the thought process.  I found The Fourth Star much more robust and insightful.  Paula is obviously a fan and didn't have any objectivity in the book. Petraeus is either awesome or super awesome. OK.  Got it. Next? There is no more depth.
  You'll love this book if you like bureaucratic history and thinly veiled hero worshiping.  Lots of pages about team building and communication in a large organization.  For that stuff, I prefer David Novak's, Taking People with You.  As an biography, it was very disappointing.  You find out that David Petraeus can run at youthful speeds for miles, but he doesn't seem to ever breathe hard, sweat or get a sore tendon.  That is, the book lacks human details and insight into the man.  I doubt that General Petraeus is just a phenomenal bureaucrat, but I'll have to wait for a great biography to find out.
39 of 44 people found the following review helpfulI have to say I was quite disappointed with this book....
  I purchased this book with the desire to understand the insides of the man Gen. Petraeus.  Unfortunately this book reads like a news magazine.  This is little insight into the man.  It is a bland history of the sequence of events in his life.
33 of 37 people found the following review helpfulAlot about Afghanistan, not so much about the soldier-scholar development
  I was really excited getting this book.  I love military history and learning about military leaders, and this book looked like it would give me a view of one of the greatest military minds of our generation.  I was disappointed in how much the education of Gen. Petraeus was left out of a book whose subtitle is "The Education of General David Petraeus."  You read some about his time at West Point, Leavenworth, Princeton, but primarily this book is a recount of his time in Afghanistan.  As commander ISAF, Gen Petraeus did apply much of what he learned over his years of study and experience in the Army.  However, the book fails to bring these two ideas together, turning into a recount of events instead of a book about Gen. Petraeus.  Overall, the content disappointingly fails to live up to the title.
  A well-written first effort by this author, however for those of us up to speed on military doctrine and recent military history, little new was presented. There was very little about Petraeus' family, or his wife's. A lot of the same old war stories. I was frankly a bit disappointed.
  First, let me confess that I probably would never have read this book without the scandal attached to it. I also mostly skimmed through the middle and end sections. I wasn't expecting a tell-all story of their affair, but I was curious to see hypocrisy in action. My favorite part of the book was the ironic and glowing reviews on the book jacket.I think I can be pretty objective on the actual content of the book. I had some minimal expectations of learning something about Petraeus and maybe hearing a few interesting stories. I noticed immediately that sections of the writing in the book didn't seem to match others. Some parts were really very bad and lacked grammatical cohesion. It was shockingly bad writing for a Harvard grad and PhD candidate. Other parts were written in a grammatically solid but mind-numbingly boring style. I think the differences could be from heavy editing or the different co-authors.Lots of time is spent excessively covering small details that add nothing to the readers enjoyment of this book. Some examples of this I can recall are the paragraphs on the genealogy of Holly Petraeus back to the 1600s and her father's school grades. I didn't learn anything about Petreus's leadership or his unique views on the the war. It seemed like a lot of fluff and propaganda type stuff. This is the kind of "leadership" information you would find in a brochure at a self help seminar. It didn't show any of the gritty truth of reality. Thus, I skimmed through most of the book.I noticed one reviewer complain that since the scandal broke there have been more "one star" reviews. I don't think this is entirely due to personal animosity towards Petraeus or Broadwell. I think rather the "five star" reviewers prior to the scandal were biased in favor of the book because people had such admiration for Petraeus they overlooked the book's flaws.Please excuse the typos I probably inserted in this review. I'm too lazy to look for them :)
  I read the book--at the time I thought it was so much flattery of the General. General P was a "political" general--first, marrying the Superintendent's (MG Knowlton) daughter gave him a fast track forward advantage within his USMA class pursuit of stars. Paula gives credit to MG Knowlton for the Hamlet Evaluation System(HES) in RVN--(that was a total failure IMHO as an advisor with John Paul Vann in Pleiku). However, General P did his doctoral thesis on Vietnam at Princeton, but never served there.Question for SECDEF and OMB DOD analysts: Why did General P need a PhD? A waste of money and time. Paula reports that General P is surrounded by his many "mentees" who are active duty PhD's!! The  Army Mentorship Program that needs review. She reported he had  a "flat" organization where all his many mentees at any rank can advise him. Question for SECDEF: How many personnel were in General P's entourage in AFGHANISTAN? Count all mentees, aides-de-camp, stenos, speechwriters, cooks, uniform managers, drivers, personal security, and others. On the Imus show, the author of Assassin was in country and claimed the General P's entourage exceeded in numbers of the George Bush road entourage.Question for SECDEF: Examine the results of Army promotion boards for the last 10 years--what was the selections rate of Petraeus mentees compared to mentees of others, and those with no mentor--the officers who can do the job on their own without special supporters of higher rank. An equal opportunity problem?Question for SECDEF: Was Paula recalled for active duty for book writing or otherwise paid for the book effort by DOD funds?
      After I finished it I passed it onto one of my sons who is at LtCol in the Army.  He is a great fan of Gen Petraeus
      This book provides excellent insight to a great military leader in a significant time in military history.  Put aside all the personal indiscretions of the author and the subject.
      All In! I'm sure that's what she said.  I am waiting for her autobiography and the chapter that talks about winning her way to the top.
      My son is acquainted with the General as he is career Army.  I bought this for my brother, who enjoyed the read.
      It gives you behind the scenes look of what really was going on in the war of Afghanistan when Petraeus was in command.
      Do not be dissuaded by the negative reviews and the sensationalism that surround Ms. Broadwell's "All In: The Education of General David Petraeus.
      I have read a number of books on current general and find it very interesting on all their experiences and the amount of higher that each of them have.
      This book was a let down. It would be impossible to read without the abbreviation dictionary provided.
      I didn't really expect much from this book and I was not disappointed. Read like a TV documentary and with very little interesting details.
      This book is poorly written and a lot of "facts" are grossly overstated or simply incorrect. There's no real analysis either. Don't waste your time on it.

David H. PetraeusMilitary LeaderBorn: 7 November 1952Birthplace: Cornwall-on-Hudson, New YorkBest known as: The former CIA director who commanded U.S. forces in IraqGeneral David Howell Petraeus led the American military "surge" in Iraq (2007-08) and commanded international forces in Afghanistan (2010-11) before resigning as CIA director under cloud of scandal in 2012. David Petraeus grew up in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York and graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1974. After graduating from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College (1983), he earned advanced degrees in public administration (1985) and international relations (1987) from Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. David Petraeus led the 101st Airborne in the 2003 attack on Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. He was then charged with training the new Iraqi Army, a position he held from June of 2004 until September of 2005. Petraeus returned to a command position at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he worked on new strategies for counterinsurgency training. Known as an upbeat reporter amid naysaying prognosticators, Petraeus publicly supported President George W. Bush's Iraq policy, drawing criticisms from the president's political opponents. Petraeus became the commander of the Multi-National Force - Iraq (MFN-I) in February of 2007 and was charged with leading a "surge" of troops in a new strategy against anti-U.S. forces. He was succeeded in that post by General Ray Odierno in September of 2008 and made commander of the U.S. Central Command, overseeing operations in Central Asia and the Middle East. Petraeus was named in June of 2010 to replace General Stanley McChrystal as the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and served in that post until August of 2011, when he took over as director of the CIA.David Petraeus resigned as CIA director on November 9, 2012 after announcing that he had cheated on his wife: "After being married for over 37 years, I showed extremely poor judgment by engaging in an extramarital affair." News reports said that the affair was with Paula Broadwell, a West Point graduate who wrote a 2012 biography of the general titled All In: The Education of General David Petraeus. (The affair was reportedly discovered after Broadwell sent threatening anonymous emails to Florida socialite Jill Kelley, whom she apparently considered a romantic rival.)  Petraeus's resignation, and the salacious details around it, quickly blew up into the most-covered political scandal of 2012.Extra credit: David Petreaus was called "Peaches" when he was a kid, and the nickname has stuck with him among close friends...  His last name is pronounced pe-TRAY-us... The political advocacy group MoveOn.org accused David Petraeus of sugarcoating progress reports from Iraq in a controversial September 2007 advertising campaign that called him "General Betray Us."Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC.

=======================================================
U.S. Army Gen. David Petraeus, Commander of American forces in Iraq, testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committe on Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C., April 8, 2008.
One year ago Saturday, Gen. David Petraeus resigned as head of the CIA in the wake of revelations that he had carried on an extramarital affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell. The scandal only got weirder with each new detail. Broadwell, who is also married but was anxious that Petraeus’ eye was wandering to Tampa socialite, Jill Kelley, sent Kelley a series of anonymous, threatening emails. With the help of a dogged (some say obsessed) FBI agent, Kelley got the Bureau on the case, which eventually grew so large it turned to Kelley herself, and to an email exchange — characterized as “flirty” to the AP by a government official — she had with Gen. John Allen. Petraeus’ and Broadwell’s use of draft emails in a private Gmail account led to more than a few chuckles that even the nation’s top spy couldn’t keep his email private.
“After being married for over 37 years, I showed extremely poor judgment by engaging in an extramarital affair,” Petraeus said in his statement when he resigned. “Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours.”
F. Scott Fitzgerald once said there are no second acts in American life – but that’s not really true anymore. American public life is full of stories of redemption and reinvention, and the Petraeus scandal is no different. A year later, the key players are moving on — or trying to, at least. To paraphrase another dead writer, the past, after all, is prologue.
The star of the scandal quickly found a home in academia. In the past year he has taken up teaching positions at USC, The City University of New York, and Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. He’s also keeping busy with various professional advisory roles, including a position as chairman of the investment firm KKR’s Global Institute. And a year after he resigned, he found himself back in the news with questions about why he reportedly advised downgrading an Army captain’s Medal of Honor nomination.
The scandal’s leading lady spent time in seclusion in Washington, D.C., in the weeks immediately after the news broke, before reconciling with her family and returning home to Charlotte, N.C. In the past year she has tiptoed back into public life in Charlotte, volunteering with veterans groups (and writing about it for Politico and the Daily Beast) while giving the occasional speech or interview with local media. She even made a little foray into local politics, donating $100 to Charlotte’s Republican mayoral candidate Edwin Peacock (he lost). “I’m not focused on the past,” Broadwell said in August. “It was a devastating thing for our family and we still have some healing to do, but we’ve very focused now on how we can continue to contribute and use this for the greater good, too.”
Kelley, the Tampa socialite who notified the FBI after receiving threatening emails from Broadwell, has become something of an Internet privacy activist in the wake of the scandal. In June, she sued the FBI and the Pentagon for what she alleges were repeated violations of her privacy and disregard for her status as a victim of cyberstalking. She penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday linking her experience to recent revelations about the National Security Agency’s sweeping surveillance programs. “I hope that my family’s story is a case study about the damage that can be caused by the government’s electronic overreach,” she wrote.
The four-star Marine Corps General, who received strange anonymous emails from Broadwell advising him to steer clear of Kelley, retired from military life after fallout from the scandal delayed his prospects of becoming Supreme Allied Commander of NATO. He cited his wife’s health at the time of his resignation. In June, Allen became a Distinguished Fellow at the Brookings Institution and has become a vocal critic of the President Barack Obama’s decision to withdraw American troops from Iraq.
A previous version of this article incorrectly identified the person with whom Petraeus shared draft emails in a private Gmail account. It was Paula Broadwell. The article also incorrectly characterized the sender of emails that a government official had described to the AP as flirtatious. The emails were said to be an exchange between Allen and Kelley. 
These people whine about their "privacy" and "rights", but if THEY had a chance to spy on YOU or ME, they would do it in a MINUTE.  These types of people are RUTHLESS at getting their WAY.  They don't care who they step on, as long as it is NOT THEM that is getting stepped on.  Yeah, they need to turn the spy machine off, but these people are HARDLY the reason we should.  If anything, they make the case (to some people, not ME) we should be spying on these ego-maniacs.  I don't feel sorry for ANY of these people and if I was running for OFFICE I would NOT take a political "contribution" from them.  She is just trying to climb the power ladder again.  Bob Burnitt
Two old school generals out of the way over one incident. Not bad.The old,  "two birds with one stone" trick.Somebody wants certain military leaders out of the way. And in the case of Patraeus, this was a soldier who had the integrity to admit when he messed up. 'The DC crowd has many members who screwed up but refused to resign. Some hang on, but others had to be forced to resign. See the difference?Pay attention in the future to "scandals" that get other effective military leaders removed. It will continue to happen because SOMEBODY wants them gone. Somebody wants them replaced by "selected others".
By the way, these generals such as Petareus and Allen reportedly get annual pensions of around $200,000-225,000. That's a gift from taxpayers. You're welcome, you phonies. 
David Petraeus is extraordinarily diminishedHe has an agent who has placed him in some jobs, but he is over. He has penned a couple of articles in publications such as Foreign Policy, and most commenters have no respect for him. If he runs for anything, it would have to be in his native NY. Those folks were ready to elect weiner Weiner as mayor, so they would probably go for General Professor Warrior Scholar Petraeus. That said, when do we get to read his e-mails to Scott Broadwell's wife?
A man with Petraeus' lapsed judgment does not belong in the office of the director of CIA.  The harm that he could do at USC, CUNY and Harvard is probably small compared to the good he could do. KKR's shareholders must have knowingly voted on his appointment.  As to the other characters, who cares?
It was a sex scandal.   There are always second acts after a sex scandal.  He could have worn a diaper and still had a second act.
@lordofthefly He's a big phony, all his talk about [discipline] etc.  His 'running' everyday was part of his overall 'self discipline' I bet he was preaching that to his squeeze Broadwell as they 'ran' together.  These big phony double dealing people NEVER get what they really deserve.  They all suffer from POOR CHARACTER.  BB
@mglarochelle So true even generals think sometimes with their penis, no matter how they are hanging.
@jmac There is a second act to most everything in life, obama is living his second act and not doing so well.
@Openminded1 @jmac  Obama's eight year record will top Bush and Reagan.   One tripled the National Debt (Reagan) one was given  a budget surplus (by Clinton) and proceeded to blow it and then  to double the National Debt (even bigger than Reagan tripling it, and then proceeded to give Obama over a trillion in debt for his budget for the year (remember, Bush was handed a surplus).  Obama was handed a Great Recession heading for a Great Depression that he pulled us out of and then finally got health care reform passed (after a century of trying).   He's tops your guys any day.  
 @kanga @jmac @Openminded1 "We went from a $5.6 trillion surplus that George Bush inherited to over ... $11-plus trillion debt when George Bush left office."
@jmac @Openminded1 "one was given a budget surplus"...................  there's where ya lost me jmuc.
@jmac @Openminded1 I do not have any guys Jmac, i did not like anyone who ran certainly not Obama or the Mormon, Mccain at least to me is a good american and has paid is dues in the military. I would have rather voted for Snoop Dog then Obama, at least you know what you get with Snoop.
