Kate Noelle "Katie" Holmes (born December 18, 1978) is an American actress and model who first achieved fame for her role as Joey Potter on The WB television teen drama Dawson's Creek from 1998 to 2003. Since Dawson's Creek, Holmes' career has consisted of movie roles such as in Batman Begins, art house films such as The Ice Storm, horror films such as Don't Be Afraid of the Dark and thrillers including Abandon. She has also played on Broadway in a production of Arthur Miller's All My Sons and had numerous guest roles on television programs such as How I Met Your Mother.
Holmes was born in Toledo, Ohio.[8] She is the youngest of five children born to Kathleen (née Stothers), a homemaker and philanthropist, and Martin Joseph Holmes, Sr., an attorney.[9][10] She has three sisters and one brother: Tamera, Holly Ann, Martin Joseph, Jr., and Nancy Kay.[4] Holmes was baptized a Roman Catholic and attended Christ the King Church in Toledo.[11]
She graduated from the all-female Notre Dame Academy in Toledo (also her mother's alma mater), where she was a 4.0 student.[12][13] At St. John's Jesuit, a nearby all-male high school, Holmes appeared in school musicals, playing a waitress in Hello, Dolly! and Lola in Damn Yankees.[14] She scored 1310 out of 1600 on her SAT and was accepted to Columbia University (and attended for a summer session);[8][12] her father wanted her to become a doctor.[13]
At age 14, she began classes at a modeling school in Toledo run by Margaret O'Brien, who took her to the International Modeling and Talent Association (IMTA) Competition held in New York City in 1996. Eventually, Holmes was signed to an agent after performing a monologue from To Kill a Mockingbird.[7] An audition tape was sent to the casting director for the 1997 film The Ice Storm, directed by Ang Lee. She was cast in the role of Libbets Casey, in the film which starred Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver.[14]
In January 1997, Holmes went to Los Angeles for pilot season, when producers cast and shoot new programs in the hopes of securing a spot on a network schedule. The Toledo Blade reported she was offered the lead in Buffy the Vampire Slayer but she turned it down.[14] Columbia Tri-Star Television, producer of a new show named Dawson's Creek that was created by screenwriter Kevin Williamson, asked her to come to Los Angeles to audition, but there was a conflict with her schedule. "I was doing my school play, Damn Yankees. And I was playing Lola. I even got to wear the feather boa. I thought, 'There is no way I'm not playing Lola to go audition for some network. I couldn't let my school down. We had already sold a lot of tickets. So I told Kevin and The WB, 'I'm sorry. I just can't meet with you this week. I've got other commitments.'"[6][14][15]
The producers permitted her to audition on videotape. Holmes read for the part of Joey Potter, the tomboy best friend of the title character Dawson, on a videotape shot in her basement, her mother reading Dawson's lines.[6][16] The Hollywood Reporter claimed the story of Holmes's audition "has become the stuff of legend" and "no one even thought that it was weird that one of the female leads would audition via Federal Express."[17] Holmes won the part. Paul Stupin, executive producer of the show, said his first reaction on seeing her audition tape was "That's Joey Potter!"[18] Creator and executive producer Kevin Williamson said Holmes has a "unique combination of talent, beauty and skill that makes Hollywood come calling. But that's just the beginning. To meet her is to instantly fall under her spell."[19] Williamson thought she had exactly the right look for Joey Potter. "She had those eyes, those eyes just stained with loneliness."[20] While Dawson's Creek was met with mixed reviews,[21] Holmes attained national attention.[22][23] Holmes was soon on the covers of magazines such as Seventeen, TV Guide, and Rolling Stone. Jancee Dunn, an editor at Rolling Stone said she was chosen for the cover because "every time you mention Dawson's Creek you tend to get a lot of dolphin-like shrieks from teenage girls. The fact that she is drop-dead gorgeous didn't hurt either."[24]
During her time as a series regular on Dawson's Creek, Holmes first leading role in a film came in 1998's Disturbing Behavior, a Scream-era Stepford Wives-goes-to-high school thriller, where she was a loner from the wrong side of the tracks. The film was recut from what the director intended. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote her character, Rachel, "dresses in black and likes to strike poses on the beds of pickup trucks and is a bad girl who is in great danger of becoming a very good one."[25][26] Despite the fact that it received mixed reviews and was not a huge financial success, the actress won a MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance for the role and also received a Saturn Award nomination for the part. Holmes, though, said the film was "just horrible."[13] In 1999 Holmes played a disaffected supermarket clerk in Doug Liman's ensemble piece Go.[27] The film received excellent reviews and made a profit, and Holmes herself was liked by critics. The same year, in Kevin Williamson's Teaching Mrs. Tingle, which he wrote and directed, Holmes played a straight-A student whose vindictive teacher (Helen Mirren) threatens to keep her from a desperately needed scholarship.[28] Also in 1999, she had an uncredited cameo with Dawson's Creek co-star Joshua Jackson in Muppets from Space, which was also filmed in Wilmington where Dawson's Creek also filmed on location.[29]
The year 2000 saw Holmes feature in two film roles. The first was in Wonder Boys, directed by Curtis Hanson from the novel by Michael Chabon. The film told the story of a creative writing teacher at a university, with Michael Douglas in the leading role. Holmes had a small role (six and one-half minutes of screen time) as Hannah Green, the talented student who lusts after Professor Grady Tripp (Douglas's character, who is her instructor and landlord. Many leading critics at the time took favorable notice to Holmes in the film. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said she was "just right as the beauty with kind of a crush on the old man."[20][30][31] Her second feature film during 2000 was The Gift, a Southern Gothic story directed by Sam Raimi and starring Cate Blanchett, she played the antithesis of Joey Potter: a promiscuous rich girl having affairs with everyone from a sociopathic wife-beater (Keanu Reeves) to the district attorney (Gary Cole), and is murdered by her fiancé (Greg Kinnear). Holmes did her first nude scene for the film, in a scene where her character was about to be murdered. Her appearance was lamented by Variety's Steven Kotler.[32] In Ohio, the scene met with disapproval from Russ Lemmon writing in the Toledo Blade.[33]
Holmes hosted Saturday Night Live on February 24, 2001, participating in a send-up of Dawson's Creek where she falls madly in love with Chris Kattan's Mr. Peepers character and singing "Big Spender" from Sweet Charity. In the 2002 film Abandon, written by Oscar winner Stephen Gaghan, Holmes plays a delusional, homicidal college student named "Katie". Todd McCarthy of Variety and Roger Ebert commended her performance,[34] but other critics savaged it.[35] During the final season of Dawson's Creek, Holmes played the mistress of the public relations flack played by Colin Farrell in Phone Booth, which was both critically and financially successful. She also appeared as Robert Downey, Jr.'s nurse in The Singing Detective (2003). Dawson's Creek ended its run in 2003, and Holmes was the only actor to appear in all 128 episodes. "It was very difficult for me to leave Wilmington, to have my little glass bubble burst and move on. I hate change. On the other hand it was refreshing to play someone else", she said in 2004.[36]
Holmes' first starring role post-Dawson's Creek was in 2003's Pieces of April, a gritty comedy about a dysfunctional family on Thanksgiving. Many critics and audiences agreed that Holmes had given her best performance in the film as April. Variety said it was "one of her best film performances."[37] "Each actor shines", wrote Elvis Mitchell, "even Ms. Holmes, whose beauty seems to have fogged the minds of her previous directors" in playing "a brat who is slaving to find her inner decency and barely has the equipment for such an achievement, let alone to serve a meal whose salmonella potential could claim an entire borough. Yet it is her surliness, as well as her intransigent determination to make Thanksgiving work, that keeps the laughs coming."[38] Holmes also received a Satellite Award for Best Actress for the role. On the November 9, 2003 episode, she was Punk'd by Ashton Kutcher and the next year she was the subject of an episode of the MTV program Diary.[39]
Holmes was a contender for the role of Christine Daaé in 2004's The Phantom of the Opera,[40] but lost the role to Emmy Rossum. She later played the President's daughter in First Daughter, which was originally to be released in January 2004 on the same day as Chasing Liberty, another film about a president's daughter, but was ultimately released in September 2004 to dismal reviews and ticket sales. First Daughter, directed by Forest Whitaker, also starred Michael Keaton as her father and Marc Blucas as her love interest. The Hollywood Reporter's Kirk Honeycutt called her character, Samantha Mackenzie, "a startling example of how a studio film can dumb down and neutralize the comic abilities of a lively young star."[41] In the 2005 film Batman Begins, the most successful film of her career to date,[42] she played Rachel Dawes, an attorney in the Gotham City district attorney's office and the childhood sweetheart of the title character. Variety was unenthusiastic. "Holmes is OK", was its critic's sole remark on her performance.[43] She was nominated for a Golden Raspberry for "worst supporting actress" for the film.[44] But not all were negative, as she was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress in the same role.
In 2005, Holmes characterised her film career as being a string of "bombs." "Usually I'm not even in the top ten", she said, the highest grossing film of her career then being Phone Booth.[3] She lamented "It's not like I have a lot of stuff that's great just waiting for me to sign on to."[45] She also appeared in the film version of Christopher Buckley's satirical novel Thank You for Smoking about a tobacco lobbyist played by Aaron Eckhart, whom Holmes's character, a Washington reporter, seduces. Variety wrote one of the film's "sole relatively weak notes [came] from Holmes, who lacks even a hint of the wiliness of a ruthless reporter" and The New York Times said the cast was "exceptionally fine" except for Holmes, who "strain[ed] credulity" in her role.[46][47] The film ended up a success, even earning a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Also in 2005, Holmes had agreed to play in Shame on You, a biopic about the country singer Spade Cooley written and directed by Dennis Quaid, as the wife whom Cooley (played by Quaid) stomps to death. But the picture, set to shoot in New Orleans, Louisiana, was delayed by Hurricane Katrina, and Holmes dropped out because of her pregnancy.[48][49][50] After her daughter Suri Cruise was born in April 2006, Holmes took a hiatus from her acting career throughout 2006 and 2007.
After speculation about Holmes reprising her role in The Dark Knight, the sequel to Batman Begins, it was finally confirmed that she would not appear. Her role was later recast with Maggie Gyllenhaal in her place.[51] Instead, Holmes decided to star in the comedy Mad Money, opposite Diane Keaton and Queen Latifah in 2008. The film flopped.[52] The Canadian Press criticized Holmes's performance "While Keaton has long done zany and giddy well, and she and Latifah have an interesting contrast of personalities, Holmes' presence feels like an afterthought."[53] The New York Post, the New York Times and Variety also criticized Holmes' performance in the film, and the New York Times called Holmes "the movie's weakest link".[54][55]
Returning to television in 2008, Holmes appeared in an episode of Eli Stone as Grace, a lawyer, and her singing and dancing was praised by Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly.[56] Holmes made her Broadway debut in the revival of Arthur Miller's All My Sons[57] in October 2008. She opened to mixed reviews. Ben Brantley of The New York Times claimed "the neophyte Ms. Holmes" is a "sad casualty" of director Simon McBurney's "high concept approach" to the play. He adds that "Ms. Holmes delivers most of her lines with meaningful asperity, italicizing every word."[58] Clive Barnes of the New York Post was similarly unimpressed by Holmes – and had few compliments for her co-stars. He wrote, "Lithgow starts in a sunny, benign fashion, but eventually finds himself screeching alongside Holmes, looking tough under a glossy wig."[59] However, the New York Daily News' Joe Dziemianowicz took a more positive view of her stage debut, writing, "Holmes, a TV and film vet, makes a fine Broadway debut. Her rather grand speech pattern takes getting used to, but she seems comfortable and adds a fitting glint of glamour."[60] In 2009, Holmes appeared in the National Memorial Day Concert on the Mall in Washington, D.C. in a dialogue with Dianne Wiest celebrating the life of an American veteran seriously wounded in Iraq, José Pequeño.[61]
In early July 2009, Holmes began filming a remake of the 1970s ABC telemovie Don't Be Afraid of the Dark; the film was released in August 2011.[62] Also in 2011, Holmes played the role of Jackie Kennedy in the TV miniseries The Kennedys. Linda Stasi felt that Holmes took a while to get into the role, but was ultimately convincing as Kennedy.[63] Bob Owen felt that while Holmes resembled Kennedy, Holmes could not perform her accent correctly.[64] Dorothy Rabinovitz felt that while Holmes had Kennedy's "whispery tone", that she could not pull off Kennedy's class.[65] In October 2011, she also portrayed "Slutty Pumpkin" (Naomi), in the TV show How I Met Your Mother, episode "The Slutty Pumpkin Returns".
In late 2012, Holmes was set to appear in Theresa Rebeck's Dead Accounts on Broadway.[66] Holmes and Chace Crawford were reportedly cast as the leads in the romantic comedy Responsible Adults, to begin shooting in Los Angeles in "Fall 2011".[67] In 2012, Holmes was reported to be cast in a film adaptation of Anton Checkov's The Seagull.[68] Holmes is also reportedly co-writing and co-producing a film called Molly, about a single mother.[69]
Holmes was annually named by both the British and American editions of FHM magazine as one of the sexiest women in the world from 1999 forward. She was named one of People's "50 Most Beautiful People" in 2003; its sibling Teen People declared her one of the "25 Hottest Stars Under 25" that year;[70][71] and in 2005, People said she was one of the ten best dressed stars that year.[72] She has appeared in advertisements for Garnier Lumia haircolor, Coach leather goods, and clothing retailer The Gap.[73]
After much speculation, in late November 2008, it was confirmed that she would be the new face of the spring 2009 campaign for the high-end fashion line Miu Miu.[74] In 2008, Holmes started a high fashion clothing line called Holmes & Yang with longtime stylist Jeanne Yang.[75] Model Heidi Klum is a fan of the line.[76] In July 2009, Holmes, Nigel Lythgoe, Adam Shankman, and Carrie Ann Inaba announced the launch of a dance scholarship fund called the Dizzy Feet Foundation.[77]
Beginning January 2011, she became the new face of Ann Taylor Spring 11 collection.[78] In April 2011, she ranked 6th in People magazine's annual 100 Most Beautiful issue.[79] Holmes & Yang presented their fashion line at New York Fashion Week for the first time in September 2012.[80][81] Holmes will act as the face for the Bobbi Brown Cosmetics brand in spring 2013 and Holmes will have her own capsule collection of color cosmetics in fall of that year.[82] In 2013, she also did an ad campaign for IRIS Jewelry.[83]
Holmes dated her Dawson's Creek co-star Joshua Jackson early in the show's run.[84] She met actor Chris Klein in 2000. Klein and Holmes were engaged in late 2003, but in early 2005 she and Klein ended their relationship.[85][86][87][88] Klein and Holmes have remained friends of varying degree since the breakup.[89]
Weeks after her relationship with Klein ended, Holmes began dating actor Tom Cruise. Holmes, who was raised a Roman Catholic,[90] began studying Scientology shortly after the couple began dating.[91] They got engaged in June 2005.[92] On November 18, 2006, Holmes and Cruise were married in a Scientology ceremony at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, Italy.[93] The actors' publicist said the couple had "officialized" their marriage in Los Angeles the day before the Italian ceremony.[94]
In April 2006, Holmes gave birth to her daughter Suri. The name has Persian and Hebrew origins.[95] The first photographs of Suri appeared in the October 2006 issue of Vanity Fair, shot by Annie Leibovitz,[96] and became the publication's second best selling issue of all time, selling more than 700,000 copies.[97]
On June 29, 2012, it was announced that Holmes had filed for divorce from Cruise in New York after five years of marriage.[98][99] Following the announcement, those close to Holmes stated that Holmes believed she had reason to fear that Cruise would abduct Suri, and also feared intimidation by the Church of Scientology.[100][101] On July 9, 2012, it was announced the couple signed a divorce settlement worked out by their lawyers.[102] This was the first divorce for Holmes and the third for Cruise.[103][104] Holmes has custody of Suri.[105] Because New York law requires that all divorce documents remain sealed, the exact terms of the settlement are not publicly available.[106]
In July 2012, following the divorce of Holmes and Cruise, it was announced that their six-year-old daughter, Suri Cruise, would begin schooling in New York City in September 2012.[107][108][109] Suri was previously home-schooled.
In early March 2011, Holmes filed a $50-million libel lawsuit against Star magazine following a cover story which insinuated that she took drugs.[110] The suit was settled on April 27, 2011, when Star wrote a public apology in the May 6, 2011, issue along with an undisclosed "substantial" donation to Holmes' charity Dizzy Feet Foundation.[111]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Born and raised in Toledo, Ohio, Katie Holmes acted in high school theater productions before meeting a manager who encouraged her to go to LA for television's pilot season. She won a part in the acclaimed feature film The Ice Storm (1997) in her very first audition, but she didn't stop there. A videotape was sent to Dawson's Creek (1998), a new production by the acclaimed writer Kevin Williamson (Scream (1996), I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)), which landed her the series regular role of Joey Potter.
          Born two months premature at four pounds, Kate Noelle Holmes made her first appearance on December 18, 1978, in Toledo, Ohio. Her parents, Martin and Kathleen, say that her strong-willed personality is probably from being born premature. Being the youngest in the Holmes clan, completing the family of three other sisters and one brother, Katie was always the baby. As a teenager, she began attending modeling school. When she was sixteen, her teacher invited her to go to a modeling competition with other girls from her class. She competed in the International Modeling and Talent Association by singing, dancing, and reciting a monologue from To Kill a Mockingbird (1962). By the end of that time in New York, Katie won many awards. But she said she didn't want to model because it wasn't challenging enough. So when she was seventeen, Katie went to Los Angeles to audition for movies. Luckily, on her second audition, she was cast in the movie, The Ice Storm (1997), directed by Ang Lee. Katie's character was Libbets Casey, a rich New Yorker, who is pursued by two of the main characters. It was a small part, but it marked the beginning of her professional acting career.After the excitement of her first movie, Katie began sending in audition tapes for pilot shows. During that time, she was also starring in her all-girls Catholic high school musical, Damn Yankees, as Lola. After Kevin Williamson received her audition tape for his new show, Dawson's Creek (1998), the producers wanted her to come to Hollywood right away and read live for them. But because they wanted her to come on the opening night for Damn Yankees, Katie had to tell them she couldn't make it. Fortunately, the show's producers wanted her so much for that role, they rescheduled her callback and the result was she got the part as Joey Potter.During her first year with Dawson's Creek (1998), Katie was able to do two movies, Disturbing Behavior (1998) and Go (1999), and, for the former, she won Best Breakthrough Female Performance in the 1999 MTV Movie Awards. The following year, she starred next to Michael Douglas in Wonder Boys (2000), playing Hannah Green, a published author and a boarder at her teacher's (Douglas) house, who has a crush on him, and tries to seduce him.Her first leading role came in 2002, with Abandon (2002). She played a college student named Katie Burke, who is haunted by the mysterious disappearance of her boyfriend who vanished two years prior.With Dawson's Creek (1998) coming to a close after six years in May of 2003, it was a bittersweet thing for all the cast. Accustomed to being in North Carolina filming ten months out of a year, the cast members now had the opportunity to make more movies. Katie demonstrated this in October, when she had two new movies, Pieces of April (2003) and The Singing Detective (2003), coming out in that month alone. Pieces of April (2003) is a charming Thanksgiving movie about April (Holmes), the black sheep of her family, who wants to give her family the perfect dinner before her mother passes on. The Singing Detective (2003) is a dark musical where the main character (Robert Downey Jr.) is a writer in a hospital for skin conditions who writes a dark world of seduction and murder in his mind. Katie Holmes plays the kind Nurse Mills who tends to his every need. She also gets to lip sync and dance in this movie. Her 2004 movie schedule included the upcoming romantic movie First Daughter (2004), in which she plays the President's (Michael Keaton) daughter, Samantha, who wants to go to college without any Secret Service tagging along. Currently filming for release in 2005 is Batman Begins (2005), a new Batman movie where Katie plays Rachel Dawes, a childhood sweetheart and love interest to Batman/Bruce Wayne.
      Her father Martin Joseph Holmes, Sr. is a lawyer, an attorney specializing in divorces, and her mother Kathleen (Kathy) A. Stothers is a homemaker and a philanthropist.
      Deferred attending Columbia University twice, but finally took a single photography class in the summer of 2000.
      Bought a Wilmington, North Carolina townhouse, while filming Dawson's Creek (1998), and lived there for ten months of the year.
      Was lined up to have a 3 episode guest spot on Friends (1994) but had to pull out due to scheduling conflicts.
      Sang Eponine's theme song, "On My Own" from Les Miserables, in an episode of Dawson's Creek (1998).

      Noisy underground British artist 'Firexit' has two songs with references to Katie, one called "K H" (Katie's initials) and a song called "The reason I can't have her" featuring samples of Katie singing 'On my own' from a Dawson's Creek (1998) episode.
      Auditioned for the role as Buffy Summers in the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997), but was too young.
      Has worked with two Batmans. In Batman Begins (2005), she works with Christian Bale. Her previous film was First Daughter (2004), in which her father, the President, is played by Michael Keaton.
      Holmes's couch-jumping-worthy engagement ring is a Edwardian-style oval- shaped diamond ring of about 5 carats in a pave setting.
      On November 18, 2006, married Tom Cruise at the Odescalchi Castle in Lake Bracciano, Italy in front of family and friends. Lots of celebrity guests included Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, Brooke Shields and Chris Henchy, Richard Gere, Victoria Beckham and David Beckham, Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony, and Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy, John Travolta and Kelly Preston, Jenna Elfman and Bodhi Elfman and Leah Remini.
      Almost cast opposite Patrick Wilson (her co-star on Broadway's "All My Sons"), in the film version of The Phantom of the Opera (2004) as "Christine Daae", but was considered too old to play the part.

      Is back in Wilmington, North Carolina filming the 6th (and probably final) season of Dawson's Creek (1998). [October 2002]
      Starring on Broadway's "All My Sons" opposite John Lithgow, Dianne Wiest and Patrick Wilson. [September 2008]
      I know this sounds dorky, but I'm always having this out-of-body experience with my career. I can't wait to write it down. I can't wait to tell my grandchildren. It's amazing.
      I've kept in touch with a lot of my high school friends. When I'm home, I see them. It's really cool.
      It's important to try to be creative. I paint, and my mom is going to teach me how to make clothes. I think people should have passions.
      My family always keeps me in check. I have three older sisters, and they work their butts off. They're all very supportive of my career, but I know what's really important is kids and family.
      I felt so proud to be having a baby and so excited. And I felt closer to other women - to my sisters, to my mom. I felt empowered, like, 'I've given birth. I did it! There's nothing I can't handle. I've really enjoyed this time that I have taken to be with Suri as well as the challenges of the first couple of months: feeding and pumping, learning to decipher what each cry means - is she hungry? Is she tired? Does she need a fresh diaper? - and figuring out how to really help her.

Priorities, PrioritiesIn her mother's sewing room, Holmes records a home-video audition for Dawson's Creek. Williamson asks her to fly out to L.A. for a screen test, but Holmes declines; the trip coincides with her performance in her high school musical Damn Yankees.

February 25Riskier Wonder GirlOnscreen for six and half minutes in Wonder Boys, Holmes plays a coed temptress trying to seduce her aging professor played by Michael Douglas, who calls Holmes "a natural." She continues to break her wholesome image with her first nude scene in The Gift opposite Greg Kinnear (right). "I thought it was important to the scene and to the character," she tells GQ.

Home >> Tom Cruise,  Katie Holmes >> Katie Holmes Is "Disappointed" About New Tell-All Biography! The Past Just Won't Stay In The Past!
Not gonna lie — We’re all dying to know the secrets behind everything TomKat. The beginning, middle, AND end. But we can’t imagine how frustrating this intrusion of privacy must be for the now free Katie Holmes.
Marc Shapiro’s Who Is Katie Holmes? An Unauthorized Biography was released on Wednesday — a tell all book that goes all the way back to Katie’s childhood through her marriage to ex-hubby Tom Cruise.
“Katie has been so focused on Suri and getting her career back on track, that she just doesn’t see the point in someone publishing a book with stories that have already been reported in the past… She’s disappointed that people try to capitalize on her life…especially when it’s certain things from the past she’s been trying to let go of or forget.”
“Katie Holmes is not the typical Hollywood rags to riches story. In true storybook fashion she came out of nowhere to become the next big thing with Dawson’s Creek, but after her sudden stardom she became just another working actress. She did films that never boosted her back up the ladder to true stardom."
“She tossed her career away when she married Tom Cruise. Now, post TomKat, the fire is burning again and she has returned to her true love, with the possibility of true accomplishment. The Katie Holmes story we tell is something everyone, in varying degrees, has experienced and we can all relate to.”
As disappointing as this must be for Katie, don’t you worry. She's "laser focused right now on her future."

You're the last one, you ugly homo, to offer fake sympathy about her privacy being invaded. You are the WORST one about wringing stories for every last possible drop of filth. You beat a horse until it's not only dead, it's long decomposed. You don't care who gets hurt, not even if children are involved. You are a hypocritical, phony asshole, and this is why you're doomed to be a z-lister. God help that kid whose life you're going to destroy.

Her parents were Kathleen Stothers and Martin Holmes (a divorce attorney). She is the youngest of five siblings.Katie was raised as a Roman Catholic and attended the all-girl Notre Dame Academy. She appeared in school musicals at the nearby all-male school, playing a waiter in Hello, Dolly! and Lola in Damn Yankees.Katie Holmes: Acting CareerAged 14, Holmes started attending modeling classes in Toledo. She performed a monologue from To Kill A Mockingbird at an international talent competition and the tape was sent to the casting director for Ang Lee's The Ice Storm. She was cast in the film as Libbets Casey.In 1997, Holmes reportedly turned down the lead role in Buffy The Vampire Slayer.When the auditions for Dawson's Creek clashed with her school performance of Hello Dolly!, Katie was permitted to audition for the role of Joey Potter via videotape, with her mother reading Dawson's lines.Katie filmed Dawson's Creek in her spring break each year whilst she was at school. She later moved to Wilmington, where the show was filmed, once The WB had picked it up. The series was widely marketed and Holmes became hugely popular, with many casting agents looking to cast 'a Katie Holmes' type. She soon appeared on the cover of magazines such as Seventeen and Rolling Stone. In 1998, she was given the role of grand marshal at Toledo's Thanksgiving Day parade.Katie Holmes' first lead role in a film came in Disturbing Behaviour, released in 1998. Although Holmes described the film as "horrible", she won a MTV Movie Award for her performance. The next year, she appeared in Doug Liman's hit, Go. The same year, Teaching Mrs. Tingle was released, in which she played a student whose teacher (played by Helen Mirren) tries to prevent her from gaining a scholarship. In 2000, Holmes had a small role in Curtis Hanson's Wonder Boys and Sam Raimi's The Gift, which also featured Cate Blanchett and Keanu Reeves. The Gift is notable for featuring Holmes in her first nude scene.Other film appearances include Abandon (2002), Phone Booth (2002) and The Singing Detective (2003), when she played Robert Downey Jr.'s nurse. In 2004, Katie played the president's daughter in First Daughter . The film received terrible reviews and suffered from very poor ticket sales at the cinema. The most successful film of Holmes' career was Batman Begins, released in 2005. In the film, she plays Rachel Dawes, a Gotham City attorney. She also appeared in Thank You For Smoking, alongside Aaron Eckhart.Katie Holmes: Personal LifeDuring the first and second season of Dawson's Creek, Katie Holmes dated co-star Joshua Jackson but the relationship ended on friendly terms.

Less than a month later, Cruise proposed at the top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris.Katie Holmes gave birth to her first child, a girl named Suri, on 18.4.2006, exactly one year after her and Cruise had met. Photographer Annie Liebowitz took the first public photographs of Suri, for Vanity Fair.
