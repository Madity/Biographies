Sir Philip Anthony Hopkins, CBE (born 31 December 1937) is a Welsh actor of film, stage, and television, and a composer and painter. After graduating from the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama in 1957, he trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, and was then spotted by Laurence Olivier who invited him to join the Royal National Theatre. In 1968, he got his break in film in The Lion in Winter playing Richard I.
Considered to be one of the greatest living actors,[1][2][3] Hopkins is well known for his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, its sequel Hannibal, and the prequel Red Dragon. Other notable films include The Mask of Zorro, The Bounty, Meet Joe Black, The Elephant Man, Magic, 84 Charing Cross Road, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Legends of the Fall, Thor, The Remains of the Day, Amistad, Nixon, The World's Fastest Indian, Instinct, and Fracture.
Along with his Academy Award, Hopkins has also won three BAFTA Awards, two Emmys and the Cecil B. DeMille Award. In 1993, Hopkins was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to the arts.[4] He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003, and was made a Fellow of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2008.[5][6]
Hopkins was born in Margam, Port Talbot, Wales, on 31 December 1937, the son of Muriel Anne (née Yeats) and Richard Arthur Hopkins, a baker.[7] His schooldays were unproductive; he found that he would rather immerse himself in art, such as painting and drawing, or playing the piano, than attend to his studies. In 1949, to instill discipline, his parents insisted he attend Jones' West Monmouth Boys' School in Pontypool, Wales. He remained there for five terms and was then educated at Cowbridge Grammar School in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales.[8]
Hopkins was influenced and encouraged to become an actor by Welsh compatriot Richard Burton (who was also born in Port Talbot), whom he met briefly at the age of 15. To that end, he enrolled at the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama in Cardiff, Wales, from which he graduated in 1957.[4] After two years in the British Army doing his national service, he moved to London, where he trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.[9]
Hopkins made his first professional stage appearance in the Palace Theatre, Swansea, in 1960 with Swansea Little Theatre's production of Have a Cigarette.[10]
In 1965, after several years in repertory, he was spotted by Sir Laurence Olivier, who invited him to join the Royal National Theatre.[4] Hopkins became Olivier's understudy, and filled in when Olivier was struck with appendicitis during a production of August Strindberg's The Dance of Death. Olivier later noted in his memoir, Confessions of an Actor, that "A new young actor in the company of exceptional promise named Anthony Hopkins was understudying me and walked away with the part of Edgar like a cat with a mouse between its teeth."[11] Despite his success at the National, Hopkins tired of repeating the same roles nightly and yearned to be in films. He made his small-screen debut in a 1967 BBC broadcast of A Flea in Her Ear. In 1968, he got his break in The Lion in Winter playing Richard I, along with Peter O'Toole, Katharine Hepburn, and future James Bond star Timothy Dalton.
Although Hopkins continued in theatre (most notably at the National Theatre as Lambert Le Roux in Pravda by David Hare and Howard Brenton and as Antony in Antony and Cleopatra opposite Judi Dench as well as in the Broadway production of Peter Shaffer's Equus, directed by John Dexter) he gradually moved away from it to become more established as a television and film actor. His Pierre Bezukhov for the BBC War and Peace (1972) was particularly memorable. In 1972 he portrayed WWI British Prime Minister David Lloyd George in Young Winston, and in 1977 he played British Army officer John Frost in Richard Attenborough's WWII film A Bridge Too Far. He has since gone on to enjoy a long career, winning many plaudits and awards for his performances. In 1980 he starred in The Elephant Man as the English doctor Sir Frederick Treves, who attends to Joseph Merrick (portrayed by John Hurt), a severely deformed man in 19th century London. That year he also starred opposite Shirley MacLaine in A Change of Seasons and famously said “she was the most obnoxious actress I have ever worked with."[12] In 1984 he starred opposite Mel Gibson in The Bounty as William Bligh, captain of the Royal Navy ship the HMS Bounty, in a retelling of the mutiny on the Bounty.
Hopkins was made a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) in 1987, and a Knight Bachelor in 1993.[13][14] In 1988, Hopkins was made an Honorary D.Litt and in 1992 was awarded Honorary fellowship from the University of Wales, Lampeter.[15] A few years later in a The Tonight Show with Jay Leno appearance, Hopkins humbly admitted that he liked his American fans and friends to call him "Tony". Hopkins was Britain's highest paid performer in 1998, starring in The Mask of Zorro and Meet Joe Black, and also agreed to reprise his role as Dr Hannibal Lecter for a fee of £15 million.[16] Hopkins received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003.[5]
Hopkins has stated that his role as Burt Munro, whom he portrayed in his 2005 film The World's Fastest Indian, was his favourite. He also asserted that Munro was the easiest role that he had played because both men have a similar outlook on life.[17] In 2006, Hopkins was the recipient of the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement.[18] In 2008, he received the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award, the highest award the British Film Academy can bestow.[6]
Hopkins portrayed Odin, the Allfather or "king" of Asgard, in the film adaptation of Marvel Comics' Thor.[19] On 24 February 2010, it was announced that Hopkins had been cast in the supernatural thriller The Rite, which was released on 28 January 2011. He played a priest who is "an expert in exorcisms and whose methods are not necessarily traditional".[20] Hopkins, who is quoted as saying "I don't know what I believe, myself personally", reportedly wrote a line--"Some days I don't know if I believe in God or Santa Claus or Tinkerbell"—into his character in order to identify with it.[21] On the other hand, in other sources from the same time, he is quoted as saying that he did believe in God and had done so for decades.[22] On 21 September 2011, Peter R. de Vries named Hopkins in the role of the Heineken owner Freddy Heineken in a future film about his kidnapping.
Hopkins portrayed Alfred Hitchcock in Sacha Gervasi's biopic Hitchcock, following his career while making Psycho. The film was released on 23 November 2012. In 2013, he reprised his role as Odin in Thor: The Dark World. In 2014, he portrayed Methuselah in Darren Aronofsky's Noah.
Hopkins is renowned for his preparation for roles. He has indicated in interviews that once he has committed to a project, he will go over his lines as many times as is needed (sometimes upwards of 200) until the lines sound natural to him, so that he can "do it without thinking". This leads to an almost casual style of delivery that belies the amount of groundwork done beforehand. While it can allow for some careful improvisation, it has also brought him into conflict with the occasional director who departs from the script, or demands what the actor views as an excessive number of takes. Hopkins has stated that after he is finished with a scene, he simply discards the lines, not remembering them later on. This is unlike others who usually remember their lines from a film even years later.[23] Richard Attenborough, who has directed Hopkins on five occasions, found himself going to great lengths during the filming of Shadowlands (1993) to accommodate the differing approaches of his two stars (Hopkins and Debra Winger), who shared many scenes. Whereas Hopkins, preferring the spontaneity of a fresh take, liked to keep rehearsals to a minimum, Winger rehearsed continuously. To allow for this, Attenborough stood in for Hopkins during Winger's rehearsals, only bringing him in for the last one before a take. The director praised Hopkins for "this extraordinary ability to make you believe when you hear him that it is the very first time he has ever said that line. It's an incredible gift."[11]
Renowned for his ability to remember lines, Hopkins keeps his memory supple by learning things by heart such as poetry, and Shakespeare. In Steven Spielberg's Amistad, Hopkins astounded the crew with his memorisation of a seven-page courtroom speech, delivering it in one go. An overawed Spielberg couldn't bring himself to call him Tony, and insisted on addressing him as Sir Anthony throughout the shoot.[9]
Hopkins is a gifted mimic, adept at turning his native Welsh accent into whatever is required by a character. He duplicated the voice of his late mentor, Laurence Olivier, for additional scenes in Spartacus in its 1991 restoration. His interview on the 1998 relaunch edition of the British TV talk show Parkinson featured an impersonation of comedian Tommy Cooper. Hopkins has said acting "like a submarine" has helped him to deliver credible performances in his thriller movies. He said, "It's very difficult for an actor to avoid, you want to show a bit. But I think the less one shows the better."[24]
Perhaps Hopkins' most famous role is as the cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991, opposite Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, who also won for Best Actress. The film won Best Picture, Best Director and Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay). It is one of the shortest lead performances to win an Oscar, as Hopkins only appears on screen for little over 16 minutes, less than 14% of the film's running time.[8] Hopkins reprised his role as Lecter twice in Hannibal (2001) and Red Dragon (2002). His original portrayal of the character in The Silence of the Lambs has been labelled by the American Film Institute as the number-one film villain.[25] At the time he was offered the role, Hopkins was making a return to the London stage, performing in M. Butterfly. He had come back to Britain after living for a number of years in Hollywood, having all but given up on a career there, saying, "Well that part of my life's over; it's a chapter closed. I suppose I'll just have to settle for being a respectable actor poncing around the West End and doing respectable BBC work for the rest of my life."[11]
Hopkins played the iconic villain in adaptations of the first three of the Lecter novels by Thomas Harris. The author was reportedly very pleased with Hopkins' portrayal of his antagonist. However, Hopkins stated that Red Dragon would feature his final performance as the character, and that he would not reprise even a narrative role in the latest addition to the series, Hannibal Rising.
As of 2007, Hopkins resides in Los Angeles. He had moved to the United States once before during the 1970s to pursue his film career, but returned to London in the late 1980s. However, he decided to return to the US following his 1990s success. Retaining his British citizenship, he became a naturalised US citizen on 12 April 2000, and celebrated with a 3,000-mile road trip across the country.[15][26]
Hopkins has been married three times. His first two wives were Petronella Barker (1966–1972) and Jennifer Lynton (1973–2002). He is now married to Colombian-born Stella Arroyave. He has a daughter from his first marriage, Abigail Hopkins (b. 20 August 1968), who is an actress and singer. On Christmas Eve 2012, Hopkins celebrated his 10th wedding anniversary by renewing his vows at St David's Cathedral in Pembrokeshire, Wales.[27]
Hopkins has offered his support to various charities and appeals, notably becoming President of the National Trust's Snowdonia Appeal, raising funds for the preservation of the Snowdonia National Park in north Wales, which in 1998 he donated £1 million towards, and to aid the Trust's efforts to purchase parts of Snowdon.[16][28] Prior to the campaign, Hopkins authored Anthony Hopkins' Snowdonia, which was published in 1995.[29] Hopkins has been a patron of the YMCA centre in his hometown of Port Talbot, South Wales for more than 20 years, having first joined the YMCA in the 1950s.[30] Hopkins also takes time to support other various philanthropic groups. He was a Guest of Honour at a Gala Fundraiser for Women in Recovery, Inc., a Venice, California-based non-profit organisation offering rehabilitation assistance to women in recovery from substance abuse. Although he resides in Malibu, California he is also a volunteer teacher at the Ruskin School of Acting in Santa Monica, California.
Hopkins was an alcoholic; he stopped drinking on 25 December 1975.[31][32] He said that a major help in his recovery was his belief in God.[33] He has also criticised atheism, saying "being an atheist must be like living in a closed cell with no windows”.[34] He quit smoking using the Allen Carr method.[35]
As stated to TMZ in October 2010, Hopkins is a vegetarian. In 2008, he embarked on a weight loss programme, and by 2010, he had lost 80 pounds.[36]
The Anthony Hopkins Centre, a £2.3 million wing of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama in Cardiff, was named after him.[37]
Hopkins is a prominent member of environmental protection group Greenpeace and as of early 2008 featured in a television advertisement campaign, voicing concerns about Japan's continuing annual whale hunt.[38] Hopkins has been a patron of RAPt (Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners Trust) since its early days and helped open their first intensive drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit at Downview (HM Prison) in 1992.
He is an admirer of the comedian Tommy Cooper. On 23 February 2008, as patron of the Tommy Cooper Society, the actor unveiled a commemorative statue in the entertainer's home town of Caerphilly, South Wales. For the ceremony, Hopkins donned Cooper's trademark fez and performed a comic routine.[39]
In 1986, he released a single called "Distant Star", which peaked at No. 75 in the UK Singles Chart.[40] In 2007, he announced he would retire temporarily from the screen to tour around the world.[41] Hopkins has also written music for the concert hall, in collaboration with Stephen Barton as orchestrator. These compositions include The Masque of Time, given its world premiere with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra in October 2008, and Schizoid Salsa.[42]
In 1990, Hopkins directed "Dylan Thomas: Return Journey" which was his directing debut for the screen. In 1996, he directed August, an adaptation of Chekhov's Uncle Vanya set in Wales. His first screenplay, an experimental drama called Slipstream, which he also directed and scored, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007.
In 1997, Hopkins narrated BBC natural documentary series, Killing for a Living, which showed predatory behaviour in nature. He narrated episode 1 through 3 before being replaced by John Shrapnel.
Hopkins is a fan of the BBC sitcom Only Fools and Horses, and once remarked in an interview how he would love to appear in the series. Writer John Sullivan saw the interview, and with Hopkins in mind created the character Danny Driscoll, a local villain. However, filming of the new series coincided with the filming of The Silence of the Lambs, making Hopkins unavailable. The role instead went to Roy Marsden.[43]
On 31 October 2011, André Rieu released an album for which Hopkins composed a waltz called "And the Waltz Goes On". The album was given the same name as the song.
In January 2012, Hopkins released an album of classical music, entitled Composer, performed by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra released by Decca.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Anthony Hopkins was born on December 31, 1937, in Margam, Wales, to Muriel Anne (Yeats) and Richard Arthur Hopkins, a baker. His parents were both half Welsh and half English. Influenced by Richard Burton, he decided to study at College of Music and Drama and graduated in 1957. In 1965, he moved to London and joined the National Theatre, invited by Laurence Olivier, who could see the talent in Hopkins. In 1967, he made his first film for television, A Flea in Her Ear (1967).From this moment on, he enjoyed a successful career in cinema and television. In 1968, he worked on The Lion in Winter (1968) with Timothy Dalton. Many successes came later, and Hopkins' remarkable acting style reached the four corners of the world. In 1977, he appeared in two major films: A Bridge Too Far (1977) with James Caan, Gene Hackman, Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Elliott Gould and Laurence Olivier, and Maximilian Schell. In 1980, he worked on The Elephant Man (1980). Two good television literature adaptations followed: Othello (1981) and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1982). In 1987 he was awarded with the Commander of the order of the British Empire. This year was also important in his cinematic life, with 84 Charing Cross Road (1987), acclaimed by specialists. In 1993, he was knighted.In the 1990s, Hopkins acted in movies like Desperate Hours (1990) and Howards End (1992), The Remains of the Day (1993) (nominee for the Oscar), Legends of the Fall (1994), Nixon (1995) (nominee for the Oscar), Surviving Picasso (1996), Amistad (1997) (nominee for the Oscar), The Mask of Zorro (1998), Meet Joe Black (1998) and Instinct (1999). His most remarkable film, however, was The Silence of the Lambs (1991), for which he won the Oscar for Best Actor. He also got a B.A.F.T.A. for this role.
        Often plays very proper and restrained British characters, as in The Remains of the Day (1993) and Shadowlands (1993).
        Often plays controversial, real life characters: William Bligh in The Bounty (1984), Adolf Hitler in The Bunker (1981), Richard Bruno Hauptman in The Lindbergh Kidnapping Case (1976), and Richard Nixon in Nixon (1995)
      Is proud of his improvisational touches as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs (1991) such as: the unnerving effect on Jodie Foster when he mocked her character's West Virginia accent; the distorion of the word "chianti" and the vile slurping sound he makes after he describes eating the "census-taker." Hopkins also notes that Hannibal never blinked his eyes when he spoke.
      Into the 1991 restoration of Spartacus (1960), scenes were reintroduced which had been cut from the picture's 1967 reissue. One such segment has Laurence Olivier, in the role of Marcus Crassus, attempting to seduce the slave Antoninus (played by Tony Curtis). But the original soundtrack for this segment had become lost. And so, Olivier having died in 1989, Anthony Hopkins imitated the voice of Olivier (whom Hopkins had understudied at the Old Vic) for the scene's re-created soundtrack. (The surviving Tony Curtis presumably supplied his own voice.)
      One of his greatest pleasures in past years on his frequent visits to the USA was to get in a car and drive across the country, enjoying its immensity as well as his own anonymity.
      9/99: Was selected by an Entertainment Weekly on-line movie poll as the Best Modern Actor and the Best Villain for his role as Hannibal Lecter.

      He chose to play Prof. Van Helsing in Dracula (1992) because he was still riding the success of his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and wanted to pick a role as far removed from Lecter as possible.
      His Oscar-winning performance as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs (1991) was ranked #1 on the American Film Institute's Villains list in its compilation of the 100 Years of The Greatest Screen Heroes and Villains.
      As a child, he was very close to his maternal grandfather, who for some reason called him "George", while his father called him "Charlie".
      He included some unusual touches for Hannibal Lecter during his preparation for the role, among which were making Lecter's voice similar to the cutting warble of Katharine Hepburn and almost never blinking, a characteristic he picked up from watching tapes of convicted murderer Charles Manson.
      Has played a (future) king of England (Richard Lionheart in The Lion in Winter (1968)) and two U.S. Presidents. Interestingly, President Richard Nixon and his brothers were all named after British kings, so it's likely that he played Nixon's namesake.
      Has three roles in common with Brian Cox. Both of them have played Titus Andronicus. Hopkins appeared on stage as King Lear in 1986, the same year that Manhunter (1986), which starred Cox as Hannibal Lecter, was released. He was succeeded in the role of Lear by Cox in 1991, the same year that he succeeded Cox in the role of Hannibal Lecter.
      Is a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), Stratford Upon Avon, England, where he spent three seasons after graduating from RADA.

      I was lousy in school. Real screwed-up. A moron. I was antisocial and didn't bother with the other kids. A really bad student. I didn't have any brains. I didn't know what I was doing there. That's why I became an actor.
      [Interviewed on Inside the Actors Studio (1994)] I once asked a Jesuit priest what was the best short prayer he knew. He said, "Fuck it,' as in, "Fuck it; it's in God's hands."
      The Welsh people have a talent for acting that one does not find in the English. The English lack heart.
      [December 1998] To hell with this stupid show business, this ridiculous showbiz, this futile waste of life. I look back and see a desert wasteland. All those years spent in a fake environment. Everything was a fake.
      [on becoming a U.S. citizen in 2000] America has been very generous to me, magnanimous really. I thought it would be good to give something back. It was a decision of the heart.
      [on his days as an alcoholic, when he was drinking Mexican Spirit tequila] I was really sort of on a prolonged acid trip. I saw things and had peculiar quasi-religious experiences. I thought I was John The Baptist, and I would talk to the sea at Malibu and the sea would talk back to me. It was weird.
      [on his most famous character, Dr. Hannibal Lecter] I think he might be a very interesting person to have lunch with, provided that YOU weren't the lunch.
      One of the people I got to know years ago, which was a great privilege, was Laurence Olivier. He was like a laser - that was his power. And the only actor I've met since who had that same quality of laser-like determination is Russell Crowe. The first day I started working with him, I thought, "That guy's got it." The best way to describe Russell is, he's like a shark circling round. He was argumentative. He argued with the director all the time. I don't know Russell that well, but I admire him, and you know, whatever he's got to do really. I really like him because he's ballsy, he's got guts, he's macho and all the rest of it. He's going through his bad boy period, but he's basically a nice guy.
      Being a smoker is like being trapped in a complicated maze. It's as if Allen Carr has a plan of the maze. Instantly I was freed from my addiction.
      Acting is still enjoyable, but there are no more challenges any more for me. No, none at all. I'm much more interested in painting and composing music these days. I've become what I always wanted to be, a jobbing actor. I'm just detached, I do my thing. I work hard at it, but I don't invest my life in it. As long as they pay me on time and I get a good script with a good director, I have fun. That's all.
      [on former US President Bill Clinton] It seems to me that the country rather misses him. He has impressed me. He asked me if I wanted to accompany him on a trip to Brazil, and so off I went. I'd met the President before in Washington, a very nice guy. So we were at this dinner, talking after his gig, he gave this incredible speech and he said, "Would you like to come to Brazil with me next week?". Of course I said, "Yes". He's pretty exhausting to be with, because he's always wanting to play cards or golf.
      I think the first British actor who really worked well in cinema was Albert Finney. He was a back-street Marlon Brando. He brought a great wittiness and power to the screen. The best actor we've had.
      I've done some good films. The Remains of the Day (1993) was alright. The Silence of the Lambs (1991). Nixon (1995) I enjoyed. One of my favourites was working with Roger Donaldson on The World's Fastest Indian (2005). That was fun and seems to be quite popular. It is wonderful to have reached that point where I can do what grabs my attention, when I want to. I'm glad those days are gone where I was yearning for work. People think I've worked a lot, but I haven't. I've had a lot of time off. I've turned down a lot. When you're younger you want to get every part to stop other people getting it. Nowadays, I don't care - let them do it. I don't go through that terrible thing of thinking, "If I don't do it, then who's going to get to do it?" I just mosey my way through and see what happens.
      On Oliver Stone: Oh, Oliver's crazy, but I like him. He's very rude to people. He insults people - he insults me - but you just have to give it back. He says to me, "Oh, you're getting old." So you shoot back with, "Yeah, so are you. You're getting bald, too. You've aged, you're getting balder. Actually, you look older than me, Oliver. It's no good dying your hair like that." But he's good. He's a very talented man. He can be a bit exhausting. I did about 18 hours on Alexander (2004). I never saw it. I understand it wasn't very good. I did 18 hours one night out in Borehamwood and thought, "No, that's it." Had a long rest after that.
      On David Lynch: I wrote him a letter not so long ago because I'd seen The Elephant Man (1980) again. I wrote him a letter to apologise for my bad behaviour on that film. I was terribly behaved and very rebellious. He wanted to do too many takes and I couldn't do it. And he was a little remote and I could never understand what he was talking about which made me very irritable. I haven't seen him for years but he's a smart man, a very daring figure. I like David very much. Brilliant, I think.
      My own father was a tough man. He was a pretty red hot guy but he was also cold. He was also slightly disappointed in me because I was not a good kid as a school boy, you know. But I learned from it, I liked that coldness, because it was harsh. And he taught me to be tough. So I know how to be tough. I know how to be strong. I know how to be ruthless. It's part of my nature. I wouldn't be an actor if I wasn't.
      It's fun to get the Oscar, it was fun to get a knighthood. But you know, you wake up in the morning, the reality's still there. You're still mortal.
      I'd been to the dentist, and I was seven years old, to have a tooth taken out. In those days they yanked it out. I was feeling nauseous and I hallucinated. I was in bed and I remember waking up with a knock at the door - a box was put in my bedroom. And it was full of encyclopedias, which my father had got me. I remember looking through those books and finding a knowledge. I learned everything I could.
      For many, many years I felt like I didn't belong. I was a duffer at school - everything was incomprehensible to me.
      I was an only child. My mother married into a family of in-laws. She felt like an outsider; which she was. She was a powerful force in my father's life. He was a baker - and she was ambitious for him. She didn't want him to be subservient to his father. She woke him up.
      [on meeting his third wife, Stella Arroyave, a Colombian-born antiques dealer]: I married a remarkable woman who has changed a lot of my perception about myself and about life. She's very positive, very powerful. Every time I get a negative thought, she says, 'Cancel it'.
      Once you accept the fact that there's nothing to fear, you drill into the primal oil well. I believe when we do things without fear, we can do anything. As long as you don't worry about the consequences.
      [Twenty-three years after asking Burton for an autograph, Hopkins was on Broadway in Equus (1977). Burton was taking over the role from Hopkins, who asked to see him backstage: "He was about to go on stage and he said, 'Why haven't we worked together? You come from Taibach'. That's the only time I met him again.
      It's nice to get a knighthood but in the end it's just the same old face in the mirror getting older and older - you have to shave every morning and you look at your face and think: this is it, this is the deal. And there's a wonderful harsh reality about that. Time is going by. I better get on with it. I better live.
      I became an actor but I still don't feel that I'm a part of this profession. I never have - 50 years I've been doing it.
      [on working with Woody Allen on You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (2010): "I wasn't sure how he would be - I'd heard stories that he was aloof. Woody says 'Okay, you come in through the door - let's rehearse it. Okay, that's good. Sure. Let's shoot it'. So we shoot it. 'Okay, very good. But improvise'."
      [He did try therapy, briefly, but didn't like it]: Well, you know you never actually fess up to everything - you try to cover your ground, cover your tracks - you want to sound interesting. Living here [in Los Angeles] - all men must cry. Well, I don't think we're wired that way. I think it's okay to express emotions and grief, but to make a habit of it, this endless psychobabble in our culture - everyone goes on The Oprah Winfrey Show (1986) and Dr. Phil (2002) - it makes me want to throw up. I mean, come on!
      When I break with a friend it is sudden. I will give no warning ahead of time, just change my address and telephone number. They may be confused - but they'll survive. Nobody dies.
      I was told years ago that I suffer from 'terminal reasonableness'. From that point on I thought that was something to work on. Not to become a son of a bitch, but to say no. Now, after all these years, I can say: 'What part of the word 'no' do you not understand?'
      I don't want to be anything else other than what I am. I can say that with passion. No regrets.
      There's an epitaph on my mother's grave - I brought her over years ago and she's buried up in the Hollywood Hills - from a poem written in 1896 by Ernest Dowson: 'They are not long, the days of wine and roses: Out of a misty dream / Our path emerges for a while, then closes / Within a dream.' Isn't that beautiful?
      [At age 72]: I'm not getting the parts I was 20 years ago - but I'm still doing okay. The prospect of that blank wall where there's no more work - it doesn't fill me with dread.
      I sometimes wake at night and I can hear the sea and I think: what the hell am I doing here? How did I get here?" And I make no excuses. I say 'tough titty.' Also 'TYFP' - 'That's your f****** problem. '
      From the moment I made that decision [in 1975 to give up drinking] a very powerful thought shot into my brain - it's all over, now you can start living. It's extraordinary. That's what I'm aware of today. The powerful spirit in me. I'm not callous. It's expediency. I will not be taken for a fool any more.
      I may sound to you like a really hard man - I am not ashamed of it at all. I'm not hard, I'm honest.
      [on paintings he has done] I suppose I could call them primitive because again, as I have no academic training, I could no longer sit in an art class drawing apples or vases or nudes - I can't feel hemmed in.
      [on acting} I'm not going to turn my back on it until they tell me it's over and we don't want you anymore. So if they say they want me I will go ahead and do it, learn my lines. You know, do what I do. So it's the best time of my life now.
      Beware the tyranny of the weak. They just suck you dry. They're always complaining. I go, "How are you doing?" They say "Ahh..." and they moan and try to take from you. I know a number of people like that, but I can't waste my time on them.
      Over the years I worked with a couple of younger actors who reminded me of myself. I like bad boys. I worked with Russell Crowe in Australia before he became a star. Russell is a bad boy. I think he is terrific. Richard Burton was a bad boy, but he shook the rafters of the world. I think it is good to be bad - I was bad all my life. I still am.
      On Peter O'Toole: I had some bizarre nights with Peter when we made The Lion in Winter (1968), but to be honest I don't remember them. He enjoyed his drink - and I did, too. We weren't close friends or anything but we got drunk very quickly and there was always amusement and laughter. I love drunks; they are terrific - except when they throw up on you.
      I hated the Sixties. It was one long wet Wednesday afternoon in the Waterloo Road. For most of it I was drinking myself into oblivion.
      We like to look into the dark side of ourselves and I think that causes us great fascination and fear. That's why people like Hannibal Lecter. He was a man caught in a monstrous mind.
      I've got no problem if people want to spend hours beforehand preparing before they come on-set, as long as they don't keep you waiting. And I've read Stanislavski and did the Method myself, and all that, but now I've simplified it: learn your lines, show up, and get on with it.
      On Laurence Olivier: He was a pretty colorful personality. He had tremendous drive, and ambition, and was a real force. A very nice guy and a titanic talent. His sort of talent has, in the eyes of cynics, become rather unfashionable. There are people who knock Olivier quite often, but not a single one of them could ever touch him in terms of talent. I thought he was an extraordinary man.
      [on playing Hannibal Lecter for the third time in Red Dragon (2002)] I really wanted to play him with much more ferocious energy, and avoid the jokes. I really wanted to show what a true monster he is. He's a killer. He's a dangerous man, not Mr. Cutesy. This isn't a franchise, like Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). This is a dangerous man, who's better off in jail. So that's the premise we went with.
      I'm not good at being cooped up with anyone for very long. Maybe that's why I wasn't designed for marriage. I'm not good at any kind of relationship with people, really. I mean, I've had a number of good ones, but I get restless and I take off.
      On Richard Attenborough: Richard's a nice guy, very persuasive, a great salesman in the sense that he gets what he wants from you. He can charm a lot of people. He's a good man. I haven't seen him for a long time.
      You know when some of these megaphones of Hollywood show up on these award shows, and just never shut the f**k up? I just want to say 'Accept your award. Say "thank you," and get off!' I'm just not interested in all that bulls**t. There are surgeons and nurses and teachers, people out there who really deserve awards.
      [on The Silence of the Lambs (1991)] As soon as I saw that script I knew this was one of those special parts. I don't know why, it's just an instinct. I'd never heard of the book. I'd never heard of Thomas Harris. I read the script and they told me Jonathan Demme was doing it - I'd never heard of him, either. So I watched Married to the Mob (1988) and Something Wild (1986), which I thought was a terrific film. And we had the great cast: Jodie Foster. I knew it was something good. That was the only surefire one where I knew it was going to work. I remember my first meeting with Jodie in New York, for a reading of the whole script. Jodie had just won the Oscar for The Accused (1988) and I was kind of impressed at this wonderful young actor. I was a little intimidated, a little quiet, shy.....I didn't realise she felt the same!
      [on Hannibal (2001)] They offered me the part and a very good salary, so I thought, "Why not?" First of all I didn't think I wanted to do it again, but then they said it was going off to Venice or wherever, so I watched The Silence of the Lambs (1991) briefly and thought, "Okay, let's have another go at this." I didn't care, really. If that's what they want, then okay. When Jodie [Foster] dropped out, Ridley [Scott] said to me, "What do you think of certain actors?" I said "I think Julianne Moore is very, very good." I'd worked with her on Surviving Picasso (1996). And she pulled it off beautifully. If the film succeeded or not, I don't mind. You move on.
      I went to America years ago because I felt I didn't fit in here [UK]. I worked with some good people here, like Judi Dench and all that. But I never fitted into a group of actors here. I was on the outside; I was like a sore thumb. I didn't have any friends who were actors at all - I never did. I've always been on the outside, which is good. But it was difficult being on London in this very strange acting community. All that "theatre, dahling" - I just found it insufferable. It was just boring. So I did the thing I'd wanted to do all my life, which was to make movies. I've never felt a part of this profession, but I enjoy it. Working with Katharine Hepburn on The Lion in Winter (1968), she said to me, "Don't act. Read the lines. Just be." I said, "Okay." She said, "Watch Spencer Tracy. He didn't act. He just spoke the lines." I thought, "Well, that's pretty good advice." I think the actors from that generation were wonderful. They didn't act. They just came on and they did it, and the characters were wonderful. People say, "They didn't act. They were always themselves." Well, who else were they going to be? In England we have a tradition where everyone is acting. Too much acting.
      We're living in a pretty strange time. I went into a shop to buy my wife some clothes. They had this big plasma screen on with these women on the catwalk. I thought, 'God Almighty, what have we become?' These girls - anorexic, walking like machines, no soul. You look at fashion magazines and you think, 'What are we living in?' You look at the red carpet, Paris Hilton, and you think, 'Is there anything going on up there?' It's a mass enslavement, it's kind of fascism. It's the androgyny of the human soul. I don't think people think any more. Maybe I'm just old.
      [on what his idea of a good night is] Staying in and watching Mob Wives on TV. I don't have many friends; I'm very much a loner. As a child I was very isolated and I've never been really close to anyone. Ask nothing, expect nothing. That's my creed. We're all just a bunch of sinners crashing around in the darkness.
      [on what he considers his greatest achievement] Everything rather blends into one now. It was very nice to get an Oscar but now it just rusts and tarnishes on the sideboard near the TV. You can't take any of it too seriously. Death comes to us all. Not long ago I was in Arlington cemetery by JFK's grave and I thought how the great years of his presidency were just blown away like ashes. Nothing really is of any importance and there's a peace in that.
      [on why he relocated to the U.S.] Many people talk of London as being the heart of the swinging 60s. It wasn't for me. What I remember is the grey mist hanging over the Waterloo Road on a Wednesday afternoon. It was so depressing I moved to the land of Donald Duck.
      I've never considered myself a great actor. I'm a fluke. I work hard and I see through the bastards and to this day I have massive energy; I think it keeps a youthfulness in me. I never slow down because I love to work. I did four films last year. My agent says, 'Would you like to read the phone book next week for them [directors]?' And I say, 'Yeah OK.'
      I was away for a few weeks in a hotel watching new releases. Some I had to switch off after eight minutes. I couldn't understand what anyone was saying.

                This multitalented artist has written, directed and even composed the score for a number of films.
Actor, director, producer and piano virtuoso, Sir Anthony Hopkins CBE was born on New Year’s Eve 1937. His full name is Phillip Anthony Hopkins, born to mother Muriel Anne, and father Richard Arthur Hopkins in Margam, Port Talbot, Wales. His mother is distantly related to Yeats, the Irish poet. Hopkins’ father made a living in Wales as a baker. In his early years, Hopkins’ grandfather called him George, while his dad had nicknamed him Charlie. Growing up, Hopkins often spent time alone: due to his dyslexia he preferred to paint and play the piano rather than making friends at school. After some time his parents became concerned about their son’s lack of curriculum and in 1949 sent him to West Monmouth Boys School, in Pontypool, Wales. He only attended the school for a few terms; much to his dislike, and even now looks upon the time as rather bleak. He then went on to attend Cowbridge Grammar School instead. Hopkins recalls: “I was lousy in school: a real screw-up, a moron. I was antisocial and didn’t bother with the other kids… I didn’t know what I was doing there. That’s why I became an actor.” At 15, Hopkins met Richard Burton, a fellow Welsh actor, whose sister lived nearby. Very much influenced by this already famous man, Hopkins enrolled at the College of Music and Drama in Cardiff. Hopkins had found his vocation: performing he discovered his natural talent and something he actually enjoyed doing. "I was lousy in school: a real screw-up, a moron." Following his graduation in ’57, Hopkins had to do his two years of National Service with the army; he was known as 23449720 Gunner Hopkins. However, he left the guns of the army behind and instead set his sight on acting. In 1960, Hopkins made his professional debut in 'Have a Cigarette', at the Palace Theatre, Swansea. After this he moved to Bloomsbury, London, to train at The Royal Academy of Drama and Art (RADA), where he’d won a place. Now in 1965, having honed his craft, Hopkins was invited by one of England’s greatest actors of the time, Sir Laurence Olivier, to be his understudy at The National Theatre in a production of August Stringberg’s 'Dance of Death'. Hopkins was thrown into the limelight after Olivier was taken ill with appendicitis. Olivier noted in his memoir: "A new young actor in the company of exceptional promise named Anthony Hopkins was understudying me and walked away with the part of Edgar like a cat with a mouse between its teeth."At 30, now married to his first wife Petronella Barker, (they have a daughter Abigail Hopkins, an actress) he was bored with the monotony of theatre, but got another fortunate break when he was cast in the TV film of 1967 'A flea In Her Ear'. Swiftly he moved on to another part in 'The White Bus' and the following year, 'Lions in Winter', alongside the then unknown former bond actor Timothy Dalton. In 1969, he played Claudius in a film version of 'Hamlet'.  Although he had moved into film, Hopkins still spent several years performing on Broadway and managed to sustain a successful career in both. He starred as Charles Dickens in the 1970’s 'The Great Inimitable Mr. Dickens', the series 'Danton', in an episode of 'The Ten Commandments' and the 1972 mini series 'War and Peace', for which he won a BAFTA TV Award for Best Actor. At this time, his marriage had broken down and, before he was divorced, he had got engaged to Jennifer Lynton. After a couple of years with his new wife, his battle with alcoholism stopped: he’s been sober since 1975. His marriage to his second wife lasted nearly 30 years. In 1976 Hopkins picked up an Emmy for ‘Outstanding Lead Actor’ for his principal role in the TV film 'The Lindbergh Kidnapping Case'.  Two films of note that followed were: 1977’s action war film 'A Bridge Too Far' (it won three BAFTAs), directed by Attenborough, with an all star cast including Robert Redford, Dirk Bogarde, Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier, to name a few, and the supernatural thriller Audrey Rose of the same year. In 'Magic' (1978) Hopkins played a weird and very frightening schizophrenic ventriloquist who lost his mind and the dummy took over. In 'The Elephant Man' (1980) he displayed his emotional versatility as an actor playing the kind Dr Frederick Treves, who helped the hideously deformed Elephant Man. 'Silence of the Lambs' director Jonathan Demme chose Hopkins to play Lecter after seeing him in this role. However, Hopkins can’t see the connection between the two characters. On TV, he played Othello in the ’81 adaptation of the same name. In 1982, he won another Emmy for ‘Outstanding Lead Actor’ in the TV film 'The Bunker'; the same year he played Quasimodo in 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'. Following his respectable notoriety, he was, in 1987, awarded with the Commander of the order of the British Empire, giving him the letters CBE after his name. That year saw the release of '84 Charing Cross Road' where his character who sells books enters into a very special correspondence with New York dwelling character portrayed from Anne Bancroft’s BAFTA winning performance. It wasn't until his role of serial killer Hannibal Lecter in the 1991 film 'Silence Of The Lambs' that Hopkins would become one of the most sought after English actors. For 16 minutes of onscreen time, Hopkins earned an Oscar and a BAFTA for ‘Best Actor’ – with these highly regarded awards, Hopkins is proud of his role as Dr Lecter.On set he often unnerved co-star Jodie Foster by mocking her character Clarice's West Virginia accent. Hopkins added a subtle touch to his portrayal of Lecter, the unnerving trait of never blinking his eyes when he spoke. Also in ’91, Hopkins leant his ability of mimicking by duplicating Olivier’s voice in the restoration of 'Spartacus' (1960) because the sound track was lost and Olivier had died two years previously. Demonstrating, to TV chat show host Michael Parkinson, during an interview his gift of being able to change his native Welsh accent into whomever, Hopkins entertained the audience with a Tommy Cooper impression “Just like that!” In 1992, he starred alongside Emma Thompson and Vanessa Redgrave in Merchant/Ivory’s thrice Oscar winning 'Howard's End', based on the novel by E.M Forster. Hopkins played Henry Wilcox - the film went on to win three Oscars, two BAFTAs and a further 19 other awards. Despite being nominated, Hopkins failed to win any awards, although Emma Thompson won an Oscar and a BAFTA for ‘Best Actress Award’. Also in 1992, Hopkins played Professor Abraham Van Helsing in Frances Ford Coppola's 'Dracula', based on Bram Stoker’s novel of the same title. He starred alongside Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves and Richard E Grant. Although Dracula was based in London, it was filmed entirely in California. Originally, Liam Neeson was considered for the part of Van Helsing, but after Hopkins’ Oscar win and personal interest in the role, Neeson was turned down and the part was offered to Hopkins. In the same year, Hopkins starred in 'Chaplin' along side Robert Downey Jr. He played the only fictional character, George Hayden, in the film based on the real life of Charlie Chaplin. Directed by Richard Attenborough, the film was awarded three Oscar nominations and won a BAFTA. Success followed once more in 1993 when Hopkins teamed up with Emma Thompson yet again in 'Remains of the Day', a post WWI love story. He was nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars, Golden Globes and BAFTAs. That year, Anthony Hopkins CBE would become known as ‘Sir’ after he was once again recognised in The Queen’s New Year’s Honours’ List and Knighted. Controversially, he was allowed to keep this title after he became an American citizen, as he has dual nationality. In 1994, Hopkins went on to portray former U.S. President Richard Nixon, in the movie 'Nixon', directed by Oliver Stone. Hopkins prepared for his role of the shamed ex-President by watching almost every single one of Nixon's speeches. The real Nixon died at the time the film was being made in 1994; the funeral scene, at the end of the film, was later added. The film was then released in 1995 and nominated for four Oscars.Not content with just acting, Hopkins took on the role of director with the 1996 film, 'August', which he also starred in. The film’s location was in his native land of Wales. His love of music led him to compose the film’s musical score. His directing skills were noted as the film went onto win ‘Best English Drama Award’ at The BAFTA Awards in Wales. In his next film, Hopkins portrayed troubled artist Pablo Picasso in an unforgettable performance in 'Surviving Picasso' (1996). The film is based on the passionate story of the relationship of Picasso's one and only lover Francois Gilot. His portrayal of the painter proved that there is nothing he cannot do when it comes to delivering an exceptional and emotional performance. As an actor who is so passionate about his work, Hopkins prepared for his role, getting into character by eating the same menu as the real life Picasso. During the remainder of the Nineties, Hopkins delivered strong and memorable performances in a number of big films: in 1997 was 19th century court room drama 'Amistad'. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film scooped four Oscar nominations.  Through his career Hopkins has conquered his dyslexia by memorising his scripts – reading them through as much 250 times. Spielberg was so blown away by Hopkins knowing verbatim a seven page dialogue, he only ever referred to him as 'Sir Anthony'. After that followed roles in 'The Mask Of Zorro' (1998), with Catherine Zeta Jones and Antonio Banderas; 'Meet Joe Black' (1998) alongside Brad Pitt; 'Instinct' (1999) with Cuba Gooding Jr. and 'Titus' (1999). In 2000, Hopkins became an American citizen and celebrated with a 3,000 mile drive across his new homeland. In the same year, he also returned to his role as non-blinking, salivating, Dr Hannibal Lecter in the sequel to The Silence of The Lambs: 'Hannibal'. Although Jodie Foster wasn't onboard this time, Julianne Moore took over the role as Clarice and Hopkins, although at first reluctant, still stepped into the shoes of Lecter for the second time. Gossip followed Hopkins and Moore after their electric chemistry on-screen. They were nominated for ‘Best Kiss Award’ at the 2001 MTV Awards. After filming 'Hearts in Atlantis' (2001), based on the novel by Stephen King, Hopkins resurrected Dr Hannibal Lecter for a third outing in 2002's 'Red Dragon'. Lecter’s story preludes his previous two films as it’s set before his imprisonment. In 2006, a fourth instalment of the series, 'Hannibal Rising' was released, but this time Hopkins had retired from the role. On release, the film didn't fare very well with audiences.In 2003, Hopkins married his third wife, Colombian-born Stella Arroyave. That year also saw him star alongside Nicole Kidman in 'The Human Stain' where he played a Professor with a dark past who had an affair with Kidman's young character. Hopkins’ scenes with Kidman proved to be controversial; film critics applauded his performance. The same year, he was honoured with a star on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame. Hopkins’ next character was Old Ptolemy, teaming up once again with director Oliver Stone in the film 'Alexander' (2004) about the Macedonian King who was one of the greatest military leaders in the history of warfare. In 2005, Hopkins impressed movie goers with his performance of a mentally disturbed mathematician in 'Proof', with Gwyneth Paltrow and Jake Gyllenhaal. Hopkins played the recently deceased father of Gwyneth Paltrow's character. The film, directed by John Madden, was a story partly based on the life of John Nash, a professor who won the Nobel Prize for his work in game theory. Later in 2005, Hopkins took to the road in the film 'The World’s Fastest Indian', a biographical story of New Zealander Burt Munro whose motorcycle riding helped set the land speed record in Utah 1967. Hopkins himself is quite partial to the open road: he said one of his recent pleasures in real life was when he drove cross country in the USA, where he enjoyed anonymity. The trip was to celebrate his new dual nationality (British and American). Hopkins' career has gone from strength to strength since the Sixties. Famed actor and director Richard Attenborough considers him one of the greatest actors of our generation. With an Academy Award and BAFTA Awards to his name, he is constantly impressing audiences around the world with his amazing acting talent and charisma. Recently, Hopkins was part of a huge ensemble cast in the 2006 film 'Bobby', a film which centres around 22 people who were at the Ambassador Hotel the day that U.S. Senator Robert F Kennedy was shot in 1968. The political drama won an award at The Hollywood Film Festival for ‘Best Ensemble Cast’ which included talent such as Helen Hunt, Demi Moore, Sharon Stone, Martin Sheen, and Emilio Estevez, who also wrote and directed the film; Hopkins was executive producer. Later in 2006, Hopkins played Judge Irwin in another political drama, 'All the King’s Men', alongside Sean Penn and fellow English actors, Kate Winslet and Jude Law. Based on the Novel by Robert Penn Warren, set in the Fifties, it tells the story of elected governor Willie Stark.Hopkins can be seen playing another psychopath in 'Fracture' (2007) opposite up and coming star Ryan Gosling. His character is a man who plays a game of cat-and-mouse with Gosling's assistant DA after being accused of trying to murder his wife. After many years in film, Hopkins put pen to paper and wrote the sci-fi fantasy film, 'Slipstream' (2007). The film is a story about an ageing script writer who lives in both his own world and in reality. Hopkins acts along side Christian Slater. Hopkins also directed again - something he hadn't done since the film 'August' (1996). His next project is 'The Wolfman', currently in pre-production and to be filmed in the autumn of 2007. From actor to director, to piano virtuoso, composer and producer, Sir Anthony Hopkins CBE is one of the most talented actors of our time and an example to a new generation of actors. Still entertaining and impressing audiences of all ages, Hopkins turned 70 on New Year’s Eve 2007. He has generously donated to good causes throughout his career: he once gave £1,000,000 to the Snowdonia appeal and helps out with actors’ tuition fees. Now he volunteers at the Ruskins School of Acting in Santa Monica, Los Angeles. As he says himself: “Acting is fun!”.
