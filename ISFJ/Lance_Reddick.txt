Lance Reddick (born December 31, 1962) is an American actor and musician. He is best known for portraying Cedric Daniels in The Wire and Phillip Broyles in Fringe. He is also known for playing Detective Johnny Basil on Oz and Matthew Abbadon in the fourth and fifth seasons of Lost.
Reddick was born in Baltimore, Maryland. He attended Friends School of Baltimore, graduating in 1980. As a teenager, he studied music at the Peabody Preparatory Institute and a summer program teaching music theory and composition at The Walden School.[1] After attending the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester, he moved to Boston, Massachusetts in the 1980s and enrolled in the Yale School of Drama in 1991.[2]
Reddick was cast as Cedric Daniels in the HBO series The Wire, after having also auditioned for the roles of Bubbles and Bunk Moreland.[3] He joined ABC's hit series Lost in 2008,[4][5] where he played Matthew Abaddon, an employee of Charles Widmore, in multiple episodes.[4] He was the third of five actors from the HBO hit series Oz to star in the drama. Producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse have said they were interested in Reddick for the part of Mr. Eko but he was unavailable due to filming The Wire so they approached Akinnuoye-Agbaje instead.[4]
Reddick released his debut album Contemplations & Remembrances in 2007 and in early 2008 he was cast in a key role for the pilot of Fringe[6] in which fellow Oz actor Kirk Acevedo also had a regular role. Reddick played Phillip Broyles, the head of an FBI department investigating paranormal activities. Reddick described the hard-driving character as "a real hard-ass, but he's also one of the good guys."[7] Like Lost, Fringe is co-created and produced by J. J. Abrams.
There was some doubt about whether Reddick could appear in both Lost and Fringe in the 2008–2009 television season. However, Abrams stated that while being a series regular on Fringe, he would do episodes of Lost whenever required.[8] He appeared in the 2013 thriller White House Down.[9] He stars in the YouTube web series DR0NE, of which he is a co-producer.
Reddick currently resides with his wife Stephanie in Los Angeles, California. He is a promoter for Cree Light Bulbs.

Lance Reddick, born 1962 in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, is an actor. He stars as Cedric Daniels in first, second, third, fourth, & fifth seasons. He has appeared in The Wire creator David Simon's earlier series The Corner. He has appeared in the films The Siege (1998) and Don't Say a Word (2001).
He studied at Eastman School of Music, Rochester, New York and Yale University. Whilst trying to embark on a career as a singer and paying the bills with part time jobs, he injured his back, forcing him to quit. Thereafter, he changed direction, being accepted at Yale's graduate school for drama.
He has since worked in theatre, film and TV starring in two episodes of Law & Order. He is probably best known for portraying police detectives on HBO shows as Cedric Daniels on The Wire which takes place in his hometown of Baltimore and undercover Detective Johnny Basil on Oz. He also appeared in the 2003 Jay-Z / Beyoncé "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" video as the lead police officer.
He joined ABC's hit series Lost in 2008. It made him the third actor from Oz to star in the drama (along with Harold Perrineau and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje).[1]
He was cast with Seth Gilliam on both Oz and The Wire. On both shows, his characters directly interacted with Reddick's characters.
