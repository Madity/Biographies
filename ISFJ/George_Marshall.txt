George Catlett Marshall, Jr. (December 31, 1880 – October 16, 1959), was an American soldier and statesman famous for his leadership roles during World War II and after. He was Chief of Staff of the Army, Secretary of State, and the third Secretary of Defense. He was hailed as the "organizer of victory" by Winston Churchill for his leadership of the Allied victory in World War II,[4] Marshall served as the United States Army Chief of Staff during the war and as the chief military adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Marshall's name was given to the Marshall Plan, subsequent to a commencement address he presented as Secretary of State at Harvard University in the June of 1947. The speech recommended that the Europeans collectively create their own plan for rebuilding Europe after World War II noting, "It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world." The State Department developed most of the plan, and Truman was shrewd enough to let Marshall's name be attached to it. Unlike Truman, Marshall was widely admired by members of both political parties. Marshall received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953 for the plan, which was aimed at the economic recovery of Western Europe after World War II.[5]
George Catlett Marshall, Jr., was born into a middle-class family in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, the son of George Catlett Marshall, Sr. and Laura Emily (née Bradford) Marshall.[6] Marshall was a scion of an old Virginia family, as well as a distant relative of former Chief Justice John Marshall. Marshall graduated from the Virginia Military Institute (VMI),[7] where he was initiated into the Kappa Alpha Order, in 1901.
Following graduation from VMI in 1901, Marshall was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army. Prior to World War I, he was posted to various positions in the US and the Philippines. He served as an infantry platoon leader and company commander in the Philippines during the Philippine–American War and several other guerrilla uprisings. He was schooled and trained in modern warfare. His pre-war service included a tour at Fort Leavenworth, KS from 1906 to 1910 as both a student and an instructor.[8]
After another tour of duty in the Philippines, Marshall returned to the United States in 1916 to serve as aide-de-camp to the commander of the Western Department, fomer Army chief of staff Major General J. Franklin Bell, at the Presidio in San Francisco. After the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, Marshall relocated with Bell to Governor's Island, New York when Bell was reassigned as commander of the Department of the East. Marshall was soon after assigned to help oversee the mobilization of the 1st Division for service in France.
During the First World War, he had roles as a planner of both training and operations. He went to France in mid-1917 as the director of training and planning for the 1st Infantry Division. In mid-1918, he was posted to American Expeditionary Forces headquarters, where he worked closely with his mentor General John J. Pershing and was a key planner of American operations. He was instrumental in the planning and coordination of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, which contributed to the defeat of the German Army on the Western Front.[9]
In 1919, he became an aide-de-camp to General John J. Pershing. Between 1920 and 1924, while Pershing was Army Chief of Staff, Marshall worked in a number of positions in the US Army, focusing on training and teaching modern, mechanized warfare. Between World Wars I and II, he was a key planner and writer in the War Department, commanded the 15th Infantry Regiment (United States) for three years in China, and taught at the Army War College. In 1927, as a Lieutenant Colonel, he was appointed assistant commandant of Fort Benning, where he initiated major changes. From June 1932 to June 1933 he was the Commanding Officer at Fort Screven, Savannah Beach, Georgia, now named Tybee Island.
In 1934, Colonel Marshall put Edwin F. Harding in charge of the Infantry School's publications, and Harding became editor[10]:41 of Infantry in Battle, a book that codified the lessons of World War I. Infantry in Battle is still used as an officer's training manual in the Infantry Officer's Course and was the training manual for most of the infantry officers and leaders of World War II. Marshall was promoted to brigadier general in October 1936. He commanded the Vancouver Barracks in Vancouver, Washington, from 1936 to 1938. In July 1938, Marshall was assigned to the War Plans Division in Washington D.C. and subsequently reassigned as Deputy Chief of Staff. In that capacity, then-Brigadier General Marshall attended a conference at the White House at which President Roosevelt proposed a plan to provide aircraft to England in support of the war effort, lacking forethought with regard to logistical support or training. With all other attendees voicing support of the plan, Marshall was the only person to voice his disagreement. Despite the common belief that he had ended his career, this action resulted in his being nominated by President Franklin Roosevelt to be Army Chief of Staff. Upon the retirement of General Malin Craig on July 1, 1939, Marshall became acting chief of staff. Marshall was promoted to General and sworn in as chief of staff on September 1, 1939, the same day German forces invaded Poland.[11] He would hold this post until the end of the war in 1945.
As Chief of Staff, Marshall organized the largest military expansion in U.S. history, inheriting an outmoded, poorly equipped army of 189,000 men and, partly drawing from his experience teaching and developing techniques of modern warfare as an instructor at the Army War College, coordinated the large-scale expansion and modernization of the U.S. Army. Though he had never actually led troops in combat, Marshall was a skilled organizer with a talent for inspiring other officers.[12] Many of the American generals who were given top commands during the war were either picked or recommended by Marshall, including Dwight D. Eisenhower, Jacob L. Devers, George S. Patton, Terry de la Mesa Allen, Sr., Lloyd Fredendall, Leslie McNair, Mark Wayne Clark and Omar Bradley.[13]
Faced with the necessity of turning an army of former civilians into a force of over eight million soldiers by 1942 (a fortyfold increase within three years), Marshall directed General Leslie McNair to focus efforts on rapidly producing large numbers of soldiers. With the exception of airborne forces, Marshall approved McNair's concept of an abbreviated training schedule for men entering Army land forces training, particularly in regard to basic infantry skills, weapons proficiency, and combat tactics.[14][15] At the time, most U.S. commanders at lower levels had little or no combat experience of any kind. Without the input of experienced British or Allied combat officers on the nature of modern warfare and enemy tactics, many resorted to formulaic training methods emphasizing static defense and orderly large-scale advances by motorized convoys over improved roads.[16] In consequence, Army forces deploying to Africa suffered serious initial reverses when encountering German armored combat units in Africa at Kasserine Pass and other major battles.[17] Even as late as 1944, U.S. soldiers undergoing stateside training in preparation for deployment against German forces in Europe were not being trained in combat procedures and tactics currently being employed there.[18]
Originally, Marshall had planned a 265-division Army with a system of unit rotation such as practiced by the British and other Allies.[19] By mid-1943, however, after pressure from government and business leaders to preserve manpower for industry and agriculture, he had abandoned this plan in favor of a 90-division Army using individual replacements sent via a circuitous process from training to divisions in combat.[19] The individual replacement system (IRS) devised by Marshall and implemented by McNair greatly exacerbated problems with unit cohesion and effective transfer of combat experience to newly trained soldiers and officers.[17][20] In Europe, where there were few pauses in combat with German forces, the individual replacement system had broken down completely by late 1944.[21] Hastily trained replacements or service personnel reassigned as infantry were given six weeks' refresher training and thrown into battle with Army divisions locked in front-line combat.
The new men were often not even proficient in the use of their own rifles or weapons systems, and once in combat, could not receive enough practical instruction from veterans before being killed or wounded, usually within the first three or four days.[17][22][23] Under such conditions, many replacements suffered a crippling loss of morale, while veteran soldiers were kept in line units until they were killed, wounded, or incapacitated by battle fatigue or physical illness. Incidents of soldiers AWOL from combat duty as well as battle fatigue and self-inflicted injury rose rapidly during the last eight months of the war with Germany.[17][20][22] As one historian later concluded, "Had the Germans been given a free hand to devise a replacement system..., one that would do the Americans the most harm and the least good, they could not have done a better job."[22][24]
Marshall's abilities to pick competent field commanders during the early part of the war was decidedly mixed. While he had been instrumental in advancing the career of the able Dwight D. Eisenhower, he had also recommended the swaggering Lloyd Fredendall to Eisenhower for a major command in the American invasion of North Africa during Operation Torch. Marshall was especially fond of Fredendall, describing him as "one of the best" and remarking in a staff meeting when his name was mentioned, "I like that man; you can see determination all over his face." Eisenhower duly picked him to command the 39,000-man Central Task Force (the largest of three) in Operation Torch. Both men would later come to regret that decision after the U.S. Army debacle at Kasserine Pass.[13]

During World War II, Marshall was instrumental in preparing the U.S. Army and Army Air Forces for the invasion of the European continent. Marshall wrote the document that would become the central strategy for all Allied operations in Europe. He initially scheduled Operation Overlord for April 1, 1943, but met with strong opposition from Winston Churchill, who convinced Roosevelt to commit troops to Operation Husky for the invasion of Italy. Some authors think that World War II could have ended one year earlier if Marshall had had his way; others think that such an invasion would have meant utter failure. But it is true that the German Army in 1943 was overstretched, and defense works in Normandy were not ready.[citation needed]
It was assumed that Marshall would become the Supreme Commander of Operation Overlord, but Roosevelt selected Dwight Eisenhower as Supreme Commander. While Marshall enjoyed considerable success in working with Congress and President Franklin D. Roosevelt, he refused to lobby for the position. President Roosevelt didn't want to lose his presence in the states. He told Marshall, "I didn't feel I could sleep at ease if you were out of Washington."[25] When rumors circulated that the top job would go to Marshall, many critics viewed the transfer as a demotion for Marshall, since he would leave his position as Chief of Staff of the Army and lose his seat on the Combined Chiefs of Staff.[citation needed]
On December 16, 1944, Marshall became the first American general to be promoted to five-star rank, the newly created General of the Army – the American equivalent rank to field marshal. He was the second American to be promoted to a five-star rank, as William Leahy was promoted to fleet admiral the previous day.
Throughout the remainder of World War II, Marshall coordinated Allied operations in Europe and the Pacific. He was characterized as the organizer of Allied victory by Winston Churchill. Time magazine named Marshall Man of the Year for 1943. Marshall resigned his post of Chief of Staff in 1945, but did not retire, as regulations[citation needed] stipulate that Generals of the Army remain on active duty for life.
After World War II ended, the Congressional Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack received testimony on the intelligence failure. It amassed 25,000 pages of documents, 40 volumes, and included nine reports and investigations, eight of which had been previously completed. Among these documents was a report critical of Marshall for his delay in sending General Walter Short, the Army commander in Hawaii, important information concerning a possible attack on December 6 and 7. The report also criticized Marshall’s admitted lack of knowledge of the readiness of the Hawaiian Command during November and December 1941. Ten days after the attack, Lt. General Short and Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, commander of the Navy at Pearl Harbor, were both relieved of their duties. The final report of the Joint Committee did not single out and fault Marshall. While the report was critical of the overall situation, the committee noted that subordinates had failed to pass on important information to their superiors, including Marshall. The report noted that once General Marshall received information about the impending attack, he immediately passed it on.[26][27]
In December 1945, President Harry Truman sent Marshall to China to broker a coalition government between the Nationalist allies under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and Communists under Mao Zedong. Marshall had no leverage over the Communists, but he threatened to withdraw American aid essential to the Nationalists. Both sides rejected his proposals and the Chinese Civil War escalated, with the Communists winning in 1949. His mission a failure, he returned to the United States in January 1947.[28][29] Chiang Kai-shek and some historians later claimed that cease-fire, under pressure of Marshall, saved the Communists from defeat.[30][31] As Secretary of State in 1947–48, Marshall seems to have disagreed with strong opinions in The Pentagon and State department that Chiang's success was vital to American interests, insisting that U.S. troops not become involved.
After Marshall's return to the U.S. in early 1947, Truman appointed Marshall Secretary of State. He became the spokesman for the State Department's ambitious plans to rebuild Europe. On June 5, 1947 in a speech[32] at Harvard University, he outlined the American proposal. The European Recovery Program, as it was formally known, became known as the Marshall Plan. Clark Clifford had suggested to Truman that the plan be called the Truman Plan, but Truman immediately dismissed that idea and insisted that it be called the Marshall Plan.[33][34] The Marshall Plan would help Europe quickly rebuild and modernize its economy along American lines. The Soviet Union forbade its satellites to participate.
Marshall was again named Time's Man of the Year for 1947. He received the Nobel Peace Prize for his post-war work in 1953, the only career officer in United States Army to ever receive this honor. (Theodore Roosevelt, President of the USA and veteran of the Spanish–American War, received the Peace Prize for having negotiated peace in the Russo-Japanese war in 1904-5. Charles Gates Dawes, a veteran of World War 1, received the Peace Prize for 1925 for having contributed to reducing the tension between Germany and France after the First World War. In 1917 Dawes received his commission as a major in the U.S. Army and twenty-six months later was discharged as a brigadier general. He served on General Pershing's staff with Colonel George C. Marshall.)
As Secretary of State, Marshall strongly opposed recognizing the state of Israel. Marshall felt that if the state of Israel was declared that a war would break out in the Middle East (which it did in 1948 one day after Israel declared independence). Marshall saw recognizing the Jewish state as a political move to gain Jewish support in the upcoming election, in which Truman was expected to lose to Dewey. He told President Truman in May 1948, "If you (recognize the state of Israel) and if I were to vote in the election, I would vote against you."[35][36][37]
Marshall resigned from the State Department because of ill health on January 7, 1949, and the same month became chairman of American Battle Monuments Commission.[38] In September 1949, Marshall was named president of the American National Red Cross.
When the early months of the Korean War showed how poorly prepared the Defense Department was, President Truman fired Secretary Louis A. Johnson and named Marshall as Secretary of Defense in September 1950. On September 30, Defense Secretary George Marshall sent an eyes-only message to MacArthur saying "We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of the 38th parallel."[39] His main role was to restore confidence and rebuild the armed forces from the post-war state of demobilization. He served in that post for one year, retiring from public office for good in September 1951. In 1953, he represented America at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.
He died at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, D.C. on October 16, 1959. He was 78 years old. He is interred at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.
After leaving office, in a television interview, Harry S. Truman was asked who he thought was the American who had made the greatest contribution of the preceding thirty years. Without hesitation, Truman picked Marshall, adding "I don't think in this age in which I have lived, that there has been a man who has been a greater administrator; a man with a knowledge of military affairs equal to General Marshall."[40]
Orson Welles, in an interview with Dick Cavett, said that "Marshall is the greatest man I ever met... I think he was the greatest human being who was also a great man... He was a tremendous gentleman, an old fashioned institution which isn't with us anymore."[41]
In spite of world-wide acclaim, dozens of national and international awards and honors and the Nobel Peace prize, public opinion became bitterly divided along party lines on Marshall's record. While campaigning for president in 1952, Eisenhower denounced the Truman administration's failures in Korea, campaigned alongside McCarthy, and refused to defend Marshall's policies. Marshall, who assisted Eisenhower in his promotions, and in refusing to lobby for the position of supreme commander effectively stood aside, thus allowing Eisenhower an opportunity to be chosen for that role, was surprised at the lack of a positive statement supporting him from Eisenhower during the McCarthy hearings.[42][43]
Marshall married Elizabeth Carter Coles in San Antonio, Texas, in 1902. Elizabeth Coles Marshall died in 1927.
In 1930, Marshall married Katherine Boyce Tupper (October 8, 1882 - December 18, 1978), widow of Baltimore lawyer Clifton Stevenson Brown and the mother of three children. One of Marshall's stepsons with Tupper was US Army Lieutenant Allen Tupper Brown, who was killed by a German sniper in Italy on May 29, 1944. Another stepson was Major Clifton Stevenson Brown, Jr. (1914-1952). Step-daughter Molly Brown Winn, who is the mother of actress Kitty Winn, was married to US Army Major James J. Winn (former aide to General Marshall).
Marshall was a Freemason, having been made a Mason “at sight” in 1941 by the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia. [44]

GEORGE CATLETT MARSHALL'S LIFE bridged the 19th and 20th centuries and encapsulated the nation's transition from wartime to peacetime through two world wars and a great economic depression. Determined to succeed in his life, Marshall studied at Virginia Military Institute and the military academy at Fort Leavenworth. His excellence in military studies and his strength of character marked  him for a steady rise through the ranks of the U.S. Army.  He  became the Army Chief of Staff in 1939 on the day war broke out in Europe and for the next five years demonstrated a strategic brilliance that led the U.S. and its allies to victory.
His traits of honesty and candor gained the trust of millions of Americans and the respect of world leaders during his 50 years of selfless service. The Marshall Plan of 1948 rebuilt Europe after World War II, helped contain the spread of Communism, and laid the foundation for U.S. foreign policy today.  After receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953, Marshall died in 1959 leaving a legacy that inspires today's world leadership. The official historical record of General Marshall's funeral is published in The Last Salute: Civil and Military Funerals 1921-1969.

     IntroductionOne of the most important figures of the 20th century, George C. Marshall exerted much influence during World War II and the postwar years. U.S. presidents and members of Congress, as well as world leaders, listened to Marshall because of his honesty, fairness, and trustworthiness. His personal qualities of selfless character, patriotism, leadership, integrity, and human compassion were admired by people who worked with him.
As U.S. Army chief of staff during the war, General Marshall raised and prepared the ground and air forces to help the Allies fight the most destructive war in history, against the Axis nations of Germany, Italy, and Japan. But Marshall hated war. When he served as secretary of state after the war, he proposed to help the European countries rebuild their economies, and rebuild the peace.A measure of a man should include a few of the many statements by those who knew and worked with him, and those who hold George C. Marshall to be their role model in public service.President Harry S. Truman considered George C. Marshall to be the greatest man he knew.Former British prime minister Winston Churchill said: "There are few men whose qualities of mind and character have impressed me so deeply as those of General Marshall ... He is a great American, but he is far more than that ... He has always fought victoriously against defeatism, discouragement and disillusion. Succeeding generations must not be allowed to forget his achievements and his example."
Churchill also called Marshall the true architect of victory in the West European theater of World War II.Referring to then Secretary of State Colin Powell, President George W. Bush said the following to the George C. Marshall ROTC Award Seminar on National Security at Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in April 2002:Only one other Army general has gone on to serve as Secretary of State, and that was George Marshall himself  VMI's highest-ranking cadet in the Class of 1901. As Army chief of staff, General Marshall became the architect of America's victory in the Second World War. He fought tenaciously against our enemies, and then worked just as hard to secure the peace.Upon receiving the George C. Marshall Foundation Award in November 2004, Secretary of State Powell said: George C. Marshall was a national treasure, and so is the George C. Marshall Foundation. The foundations impressive museum and library and its wonderful educational programs ensure that the Marshall legacy lives on to inspire new generations of leaders.George C. Marshall is remembered for more than the Marshall Plan that saved Europe and other countries after World War II. An American soldier in World War I and World War II as well as a statesman, Marshall served the United States all of his adult life.Early life: 1880-1901George Catlett Marshall was born on Dec 31, 1880, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, and lived at his parents' home until 1901. George was a distant cousin to John Marshall, the former chief justice of the Supreme Court. George was the youngest of four children and was extremely shy and reserved during his youth. From September 1897 to June 1901, he attended Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Viginia. His major was civil engineering and he joined the Kappa Alpha fraternity in 1901. He played varsity football in 1900 and was First Captain (i.e. cadet commander) in 1900 and 1901.Marshall always ranked first in military discipline and about midway academically. He graduated 15th of 34 in the Class of '01. Marshall once said, "What I learned at VMI was self control, discipline, so that it was ground in. I learned also the problem of managing men."Young officer: 1902-1917In September 1901, Marshall was examined for an Army commission at Governors Island, New York. He was commissioned as second lieutenant in the infantry and became commandant of students at the Danville Military Academy in Danville, Virginia.Early in 1902, George C. Marshall married Elizabeth "Lily" Coles of Lexington, Virginia. They had no children. He reported to Fort Myer, Virginia, and was ordered to join the 30th Infantry Regiment in the Philippines in May 1902.During World War I, Marshall was promoted to captain while serving in France. He won high praise for his planning of the Cantigny operation, as well as the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne offensives. Mid-career: 1918-1938From 1919 to 1924 he was aide-de-camp to General John J. Pershing in Washington, D.C., while advancing to lieutenant colonel in August 1923. Marshall continued to climb up the ranks as he moved between assignments in numerous American states and global locations. Elizabeth died on September 27, 1927. Marshall remarried in 1930 to Katherine Tupper Brown. That union also remained childless. Marshall was promoted to brigadier general in October 1936 and continued to be promoted.
World War II: 1939-1945By September 1939, Major General Marshall had become chief of staff. In August 1941, he attended the Atlantic Charter Conference with FDR and Churchill in Newfoundland, and another in December 1941-January 1942, followed by the Arcadia Conference with the president and Churchill in Washington, D.C. Those high-level meetings were followed by trips to Britain for discussions with Churchill. A critical decision was made; Marshall was opposed to the proposed Allied landings on Sicily that Churchill favored, preferring a cross-channel attack from Britain to France  later to be the famous June 6, 1944, D-Day invasion of Normandy.Marshall was promoted to five-star General of the Army in December 1944. He attended all the key War Councils with FDR and Churchill, including:
Following the war, Marshall retired in November 1945. He was 65 years old, having served 45 years in the military.Diplomat: 1946-1948The postwar period sprouted its own problems. While Europe was picking itself up from the ashes of war, and America was celebrating and receiving service sons and daughters home, President Truman still needed a few good people. Marshall's retirement hardly lasted more than a week when he was called again to serve. With Japan's defeat in 1945, a power vacuum formed in China. Civil war had turned into revolution involving the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek and the communist forces of Mao Zedong. Marshall was appointed head of the U.S. Mission to China with the rank of Ambassador. Marshall was now President Truman's special representative. The ambassador left immediately for China for meetings with Nationalist and Communist Chinese officials, in an attempt to mediate the civil war there. The huge country become a communist state.
Marshall became secretary of state in January 1947 and remained in that position until January 1949. Secretary of State Marshall gave his famous European Recovery Act (Marshall Plan) address at Harvard University's commencement on June 5, 1947. Marshall was the architect of the plan to aid European nations beginning in April 1948. Following considerable international official travel, he resigned as secretary of state in January of 1949 at age 69.Final assignments: 1949-1959Upon retirement from the secretary of state post, Marshall immediately became chairman of the American Battle Monuments Commission, a post he retained until his death in 1959. Marshall was restored to active duty in the Army in March 1949. He also was appointed as head of the American National Red Cross from September 1949 through September 1950. The Korean War began when North Korea declared war on South Korea on June 25, 1950. On September 12, Marshall was asked to serve as secretary of defense, a post he remained at until September 1951. In December 1953, Marshall received the Nobel Peace 2007:Prize] in Oslo, Norway, for his work on the Marshal Plan and service for peace and recovery from World War II. Marshall's objective was to reach out to the nations of Eastern Europe and win a community of nations as partners. The idea extended to Europe and Eurasia. The idea persists in the post-cold war period, an unprecedented opportunity, not to advance the policy of any particular nation, but to advance the well being of all countries.EpilogueAfter a long and illustrious career of service to his country, George Catlett Marshall died at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, D.C., on Oct 16, 1959. A normal biography would stop at the death of the subject, but there is more to say about George Marshall. His legacy of service building peaceful international relationships continues to inspire today's world leadership.The 10th anniversary of the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies in Garmisch, Germany, was celebrated in 2003. The mission of the center is to foster a more stable security environment by advancing democratic institutions and relationships, especially in the field of defense; promoting active, peaceful security cooperation; and enhancing enduring partnerships among the nations of North America, Europe and Eurasia.The Marshall Center forms the nexus of NATO and the Partnership for Peace on the European continent and worldwide. Attending the function were leaders from around the world: ministers of defense, chiefs of the general staff, cabinet ministers and ambassadors, many of whom studied at the institution. America was represented by Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, among others. Nearly 50 years since the passing of George Marshall, his legacy continues to serve as the bedrock of western diplomacy in the modern world.
