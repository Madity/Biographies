Ronald Walken (born March 31, 1943), known professionally as Christopher Walken, is an American actor, screenwriter, and director who has appeared in more than 100 films and television shows, including The Deer Hunter, Annie Hall, The Prophecy trilogy, The Dogs of War, Brainstorm, The Dead Zone, A View to a Kill, True Romance, Pulp Fiction, Catch Me If You Can, and Seven Psychopaths, as well as music videos by many popular recording artists. Walken has received a number of awards and nominations during his career, including winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1978.
Walken's films have grossed more than $1 billion in the United States.[1] He has also played the lead in the Shakespeare plays Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, and Coriolanus. He is a popular guest-host of Saturday Night Live, having hosted seven times as of April 2008[update]. His most notable roles on the show include record producer Bruce Dickinson (no relation to the singer with the same name) in the "More Cowbell" sketch and his multiple appearances as The Continental.
Walken debuted as a film director and script writer with the short film Popcorn Shrimp in 2001. He also wrote and acted the main role in a play about Elvis Presley titled Him, in 1995.[2]
Named for actor Ronald Colman,[3] Walken was born Ronald Walken in Astoria, Queens. His mother, Rosalie (née Russell; May 16, 1907 – March 26, 2010), was a Scottish emigrant from Glasgow, and his father, Paul Walken (October 5, 1903 – February 23, 2001), moved from Germany in 1928 with his brothers.[3][4] His father owned and operated Walken's Bakery in Astoria, Queens.[5][6] He was raised a Methodist.[7]
Influenced by their mother's own dreams of stardom, he and his brothers, Kenneth and Glenn, were child actors on television in the 1950s.[6][8] As a teenager, he worked as a lion tamer in a circus.[9] Walken went to Hofstra University but dropped out after one year, having gotten the role of Clayton Dutch Miller on an Off-Broadway revival of Best Foot Forward, co-starring with Liza Minnelli, who played Ethel Hofflinger.[10] Walken initially trained as a dancer in music theatre at the Washington Dance Studio, before moving on to dramatic roles in theatre and then film.[10]
As a child, Walken appeared on screen as an extra in numerous anthology series and variety shows during the Golden Age of Television.[10] After appearing in a sketch with Martin and Lewis on The Colgate Comedy Hour, Walken decided to become an actor.[11] He landed a regular role in the 1953 television show The Wonderful John Acton as the show's narrator. During this time, he was credited as "Ronnie Walken".
Over the next two years, he appeared frequently on television (landing a role in the experimental film Me and My Brother) and had a thriving career in theatre. From 1954 to 1956, Walken and his brother Glenn originated the role of Michael Bauer on the soap opera The Guiding Light. In 1963, he appeared as "Chris" in an episode of Naked City starring Paul Burke. In 1966, Walken played the role of King Philip of France in the Broadway premiere of The Lion in Winter.[12] In 1969, Walken guest-starred in Hawaii Five-O as Navy SP Walt Kramer.
In 1964, he changed his first name to "Christopher" at the suggestion of a friend who believed the name suited him better than his given name, Ronald.[13] He prefers to be known informally as "Chris" instead of "Christopher".[11]
Walken made his feature film debut with a small role opposite Sean Connery, in Sidney Lumet's The Anderson Tapes. In 1972's The Mind Snatchers A.K.A. The Happiness Cage, Walken played his first starring role.[14] In this science fiction film, which deals with mind control and normalization, he plays a sociopathic U.S. soldier stationed in Germany.
Paul Mazursky's 1976 film Next Stop, Greenwich Village had Walken, under the name "Chris Walken", playing fictional poet and ladies' man Robert Fulmer.[15] In Woody Allen's 1977 film Annie Hall, Walken played the homicidal and borderline crazy brother of Annie Hall (Diane Keaton).[16] Also in 1977, Walken had a minor role as Eli Wallach's partner in The Sentinel. In 1978, he appeared in Shoot the Sun Down, a western filmed in 1976 that costarred Margot Kidder.[17] Along with Nick Nolte, Walken was considered by George Lucas for the part of Han Solo in Star Wars;[18][19] the part ultimately went to Harrison Ford.
Walken won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in Michael Cimino's 1978 film The Deer Hunter.[21] He plays a young Pennsylvania steelworker who is emotionally destroyed by the Vietnam War. To help achieve his character's gaunt appearance before the third act, Walken consumed only bananas, water, and rice for a week.[22]
Walken's first film of the 1980s was the controversial Heaven's Gate, directed by Cimino of Deer Hunter fame. Walken also starred in the 1981 action adventure The Dogs of War, directed by John Irvin. He surprised[23] many critics and filmgoers with his intricate tap-dancing striptease in Herbert Ross's musical Pennies From Heaven (1981). In 1982, he played a socially awkward, but gifted theater actor in Who Am I This Time? opposite Susan Sarandon. Walken then played schoolteacher-turned-psychic Johnny Smith in David Cronenberg's 1983 adaptation of Stephen King's The Dead Zone. That same year, Walken also starred in Brainstorm alongside Natalie Wood and (in a minor role) his wife, Georgianne. Walken was one of the last persons to see Wood alive before her drowning near Santa Catalina Island, California, while on a Thanksgiving weekend boating trip.[24] In 2011, Walken hired a lawyer when authorities re-opened the Wood case, while the LAPD said "Walken is not a suspect." The case was closed and termed an accidental death[25] until June 2012, when the investigation was re-opened and the cause of death was changed to "undetermined". Authorities stated that Walken is not a suspect.[26]
In 1985, Walken played a James Bond villain, Max Zorin, in A View to a Kill, Roger Moore's last appearance as Bond. Walken dyed his hair blond to befit Zorin's origins as a Nazi experiment.[27]
Walken played the role of Federal Agent Kyril Montana in Milagro Beanfield War in 1988. He also played the leading role of Whitley Strieber in 1989's Communion, an autobiographical film written by Strieber based on his claims that he and his family were subject to alien abductions.
At Close Range (1986) starred Walken as Brad Whitewood, a rural Pennsylvania crime boss who tries to bring his two sons into his empire; his character mostly based on criminal Bruce Johnston. In Biloxi Blues (1988), Walken played an eccentric drill sergeant, known for his stinging sarcasm and sharp wit.[citation needed] In 1989, he played the lead role of "Puss" in the Cannon theatre group's version of "Puss in Boots".
The Comfort of Strangers, an art house film directed by Paul Schrader, features Walken as Robert, a decadent Italian aristocrat with extreme sexual tastes and murderous tendencies who lives with his wife (Helen Mirren) in Venice.
King of New York (1990), directed by Abel Ferrara, stars Walken as ruthless New York City drug dealer Frank White—recently released from prison and set on reclaiming his criminal territory. In 1992, Walken played a villain in Batman Returns: millionaire industrialist Max Shreck. Also in 1992, Walken appeared in Madonna's controversial coffee table book, SEX, and he played Bobby, Cassandra's manager in Wayne's World 2.
Walken's next major film role was opposite Dennis Hopper in True Romance, scripted by Quentin Tarantino. His so-called Sicilian scene has been hailed by critics as the best scene in the film[citation needed] and is the subject of four commentaries on the DVD. Walken has a supporting role in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction as a Vietnam veteran giving his dead comrade's son the family's prized possession—a gold watch—while explaining in graphic detail how he had hidden it from the Vietcong by smuggling it in his rectum, after the boy's father, in whose rectum the watch had previously been concealed, had died of dysentery.
Later in 1994, Walken starred in A Business Affair, a rare leading role for him in a romantic comedy. Walken manages to once again feature his trademark dancing scene as he performs the tango. In 1995, he appeared in Wild Side, The Prophecy and the modern vampire flick The Addiction, which was his second collaboration with director Abel Ferrara and writer Nicholas St. John. He also appeared in Nick of Time, which also stars Johnny Depp, and an art house film by David Salle, "Search and Destroy."
In the 1996 film Last Man Standing, Walken plays a sadistic gangster. That year, he played a prominent role in the video game Ripper, portraying Detective Vince Magnotta. Ripper made extensive use of real-time recorded scenes and a wide cast of celebrities in an interactive movie. In 1996 Walken also appeared in the Italian film Celluloide as US Officer Rod Geiger. In 1997, Walken starred in the comedy films Touch, Excess Baggage and had a minor role in the film MouseHunt. He also appeared in the drama/thriller film Suicide Kings which also filled with suspense and humor.
In 1998, Walken played an influential gay New York theater critic in John Turturro's film Illuminata. The same year he voiced Colonel Cutter in the computer animated film Antz.
In 1999, Walken played Calvin Webber in the romantic comedy Blast from the Past. Webber is a brilliant but eccentric Caltech nuclear physicist whose fears of a nuclear war lead him to build an enormous fallout shelter beneath his suburban home. The same year, he appeared as the Headless Horseman in Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow, starring Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci. He also appeared in Kiss Toledo Goodbye with Michael Rapaport and Nancy Allen.
Walken also starred in two music videos in the 1990s. His first video role was as the Angel of Death in Madonna's 1993 "Bad Girl". The second appearance was in Skid Row's "Breakin' Down" video.
In 2000, Walken was cast as the lead, along with Blair Brown, in James Joyce's The Dead on Broadway. A "play with music", The Dead featured music by Shaun Davey, conducted by Charles Prince, with music coordination and percussion by Tom Partington. James Joyce's The Dead won a Tony Award that year for Best Book for a Musical.
Walken had a notable music video performance in 2001 with Fatboy Slim's "Weapon of Choice". Directed by Spike Jonze, it won six MTV awards in 2001 and—in a list of the top 100 videos of all time compiled from a survey of musicians, directors, and music industry figures conducted by UK music TV channel VH1—won Best Video of All Time in April 2002. In this video, Walken dances and flies around the lobby of the Marriott Hotel in Los Angeles; Walken also helped choreograph the dance. Also in 2001, Walken played a gangster who was in the witness protection program in the David Spade comedy Joe Dirt and an eccentric film director in America's Sweethearts.
Walken played Frank Abagnale, Sr. in Catch Me If You Can. It is inspired by the story of Frank Abagnale, Jr., a con artist who passed himself off as several identities and forged millions of dollars' worth of checks. His portrayal earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.[21] Walken also had a part in the 2003 action comedy film The Rundown, starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Seann William Scott, in which he plays a ruthless despot. He was nominated for a Razzie (Worst Supporting Actor) in 2002's The Country Bears[28] and in two 2003 movies, Gigli and Kangaroo Jack.[29] Walken also starred in Barry Levinson's Envy in which he plays J-Man, a crazy guy who helps Ben Stiller's character, and in his starring role in 2004's Around the Bend he again has a dancing scene as he portrays an absentee father who has fled prison to reunite with his father, son, and the grandson he never knew, before dying. Christopher Walken plays the role of Paul Rayburn in 2004's Man On Fire, where, when speaking about the imminent destructive actions of John Creasy played by Denzel Washington, we hear him say, "A man can be an artist... in anything, food, whatever. It depends on how good he is at it. Creasy's art is death. He's about to paint his masterpiece."
In 2006, he played Morty, a sympathetic inventor who is more than meets the eye, in the comedy/drama Click, and also appeared in Man of the Year, with Robin Williams and Lewis Black. He costarred in the 2007 film adaptation Hairspray—where he is seen singing and dancing in a romantic duet with John Travolta—and he portrayed the eccentric but cruel crime lord and Ping-Pong enthusiast Feng in the 2007 comedy action film Balls of Fury, opposite Dan Fogler.
Walken was in the movie Five Dollars a Day, released in 2008, in which he plays a con man proud of living like a king on $5 a day.
The film The Maiden Heist, a comedy co-starring Morgan Freeman and Walken, about security guards in an art museum, debuted at the Edinburgh International Film Festival on June 25, 2009.[30]
Walken can be found in Universal Studios Florida's "Disaster" attraction (formerly "Earthquake and the Magic of Effects"). Walken portrays the owner of "Disaster Studios" Frank Kincaid, and encourages guests to be extras in his latest film, Mutha Nature. Walken is projected on a clear screen, much like a life-size hologram, and interacts with the live-action talent.
Walken returned to Broadway in Martin McDonagh's play A Behanding in Spokane in 2010, and received a Tony Award nomination for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play.[31] He had a small voice role in NBC sitcom 30 Rock, in the "Audition Day" episode. Walken reunited with McDonagh for the British crime comedy film Seven Psychopaths which had its world premiere on 7 September 2012. Walken also played the founder and leader of a string quartet in A Late Quartet (late in 2012).
Walken costarred with Al Pacino and Alan Arkin in the film Stand Up Guys, a story about aging gangsters out on the town for one last hoorah. Walken is due out in a new film for 2013 called The Power of Few.
In 2013, Christopher is the protagonist in the campaign "Made From Cool" by Jack & Jones. In 2014, he appeared in Turks & Caicos.
Walken is imitated for his deadpan affect, sudden off-beat pauses, and strange speech rhythm, in a manner similar to William Shatner, which was subject to parody in a Robot Chicken episode and also the fantasy sketch series Doraleous & Associates.[32] He is revered for his quality of danger and menace, but his unpredictable deliveries and expressions make him invaluable in comedy as well. He inspired the stage show, All About Walken: The Impersonators of Christopher Walken, that was created by actor/comedian Patrick O'Sullivan in Hollywood in 2006. Walken is noted for refusing movie roles only rarely, having stated in interviews that he will decline a role only if he is simply too busy on other projects to take it. He regards each role as a learning experience.[citation needed]
Walken has hosted the comedy sketch and satire TV series Saturday Night Live seven times, and is one of only two actors to have a standing offer from Lorne Michaels to host the show whenever their schedule permits (the other being Alec Baldwin). One of Walken's more famous SNL performances was a spoof of Behind the Music, featuring a recording session of Blue Öyster Cult's "(Don't Fear) the Reaper". In the guise of a fictional record producer named Bruce Dickinson (not to be confused with the real Bruce Dickinson, lead singer for Iron Maiden), Walken makes passionate and slightly unhinged speeches to the band and is obsessed with getting "more cowbell" into the song. The phrase "Gotta have more cowbell" has since been adapted to merchandise, e.g. t-shirts, bumper stickers, etc. He is also known for his part in one of Will Ferrell and Rachel Dratch's "The Lovers" skits. His character brought a lady friend to meet The Lovers, and she is subjected to learning the past history that Walken's character shares with The Lovers. He also divulges private information about his sex life with his girlfriend, much to her horror ("She was willing to accept her lover's body in places no one had ever trespassed...specifically, the ear canal").
Walken spoofed his role from The Dead Zone in a sketch titled "Ed Glosser: Trivial Psychic", in which the title character had the ability to accurately predict meaningless, trivial future events ("You're going to get an ice cream headache. It's going to hurt real bad—right here—for eight, nine seconds.").
His character in A View to a Kill was parodied in a sketch titled "Lease with an Option to Kill", in which he reprised his role as Max Zorin. Zorin, who had taken on some qualities of other notable Bond villains (Blofeld's cat and suit, Emilio Largo's eye patch), was upset that everything was going wrong for him. His lair was still under construction; his henchmen had jump suits that didn't fit; and his shark tank lacked sharks, having a giant sea sponge instead. A captive James Bond, portrayed by Phil Hartman, offered to get Zorin "a good deal" on the abandoned Blofeld volcanic lair if Zorin let him go, to which he reluctantly agreed.
He performed a song and dance rendition of the Irving Berlin standard, "Let's Face the Music and Dance". Finally, there was the "Colonel Angus" sketch, laden with ribald double entendres, in which Walken played a dishonored Confederate officer. Walken's SNL appearances have proved so popular that he is one of the few SNL hosts for whom a Best of... SNL DVD is available (other celebrity hosts who have a Best of... SNL DVD are Tom Hanks, Steve Martin, and Alec Baldwin), an honor usually reserved only for SNL cast members.
Until 2003, Walken had a recurring SNL sketch called "The Continental", in which Walken played a "suave ladies' man" who in reality cannot do anything to keep women from giving him the cold shoulder. Though he is outwardly chivalrous, his more perverted tendencies inevitably drive away his date over his pleading objections. For instance, he invites a woman to wash up in his bathroom; once she is inside, it becomes obvious that the bathroom mirror is a two-way mirror when he is seen lighting up a cigarette. What distinguishes "The Continental" is that various ladies are never seen; the camera represents their point of view.
The April 5, 2008 Saturday Night Live show was the first time an episode hosted by Walken did not have a "Continental" sketch or a monologue in which he sang and danced. This episode, however, did include one sketch titled "Meet the Family", which spoofs many of Walken's idiosyncrasies. The sketch depicts a fictional Walken Family reunion, where all of Christopher's relatives have his mannerisms and speech patterns, and sport his trademark pompadour hairstyle. In order of appearance, the other Walkens are Christopher's cousin Stanley (Bill Hader); Stanley's brother John (Jason Sudeikis); John's son Scott (Andy Samberg) and daughter Maxine (Amy Poehler) (who carries a doll that also has a pompadour); Nathan (Fred Armisen), a gay relative for whom "flamboyance" means dressing all in black and running his finger around the rim of a cosmo glass; Uncle Richard (Darrell Hammond) and Aunt Martha (Kristen Wiig), who think that The Deer Hunter was hilarious, and who are hosts of a Nigerian foreign exchange student named Oleki (Kenan Thompson). When he came to live with them, Oleki—who has absorbed all of the Walken Family traits—could not speak any English. But now (he says) he "talks like a normal teenaged American boy". The biggest laugh of the sketch occurs when Christopher expresses his sympathies for Scott's teenaged attitude: "I appreciate your situation. For a Walken, adolescence is a difficult time. You feel like you're the only normal persons in a school full of nutjobs". Scott's response: "Wow! It's like you're lookin' right into my noggin!" (Will Forte also appears as a waiter at the beginning of the sketch, but does not do a Walken impression.)
Walken became the subject of a hoax controversy in 2006, when a fake website started in August of that year by members of Internet forum Genmay.com announced that he was running for President of the United States. Some believed it was authentic, until Walken's publicist dismissed the claims.[33] When asked about the hoax in a September 2006 interview with Conan O'Brien, Walken said he was amused; and when asked to come up with a campaign slogan, he replied, "What the Hell?" and "No More Zoos!"[33]
Walken married Georgianne Walken (née Thon) in 1969: she is a casting director, most notably for The Sopranos. They live in Wilton, Connecticut and have no children (Walken has stated in interviews that not having children is one of the reasons he has had such a prolific film career).[34] Walken has a cat named Bowtie. His previous cat was named Flapjack.[35] They also have a vacation home on Block Island, Rhode Island.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Nervous-looking lead and supporting actor of the American stage and films. He won an Oscar as best supporting actor for his performance in The Deer Hunter (1978). Seen in mostly supporting roles throughout the 80s and early 90s, often portraying psychologically unstable characters.
          Amazingly versatile stage & screen actor with sandy colored hair, pale complexion and a somewhat nervous disposition. Has a reputation for playing mentally unbalanced characters on-screen, however that generalisation would not do justice to Walken's depth and breadth of performances. He learnt his stage craft, including dancing, at Hofstra University & ANTA, and picked up a Theatre World award for his performance in the revival of the Tennessee Williams play "The Rose Tattoo".Walken then first broke through into cinema in 1969 appearing in Me and My Brother (1969), before appearing alongside Sean Connery in the sleeper heist movie The Anderson Tapes (1971). His eclectic work really came to the attention of critics in 1977 with his intense portrayal of Diane Keaton suicidal younger brother in Annie Hall (1977), and then he scooped the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award in 1977 for his role as Nick in the electrifying The Deer Hunter (1978). Walken was lured back by The Deer Hunter (1978) director Michael Cimino for a role in the financially disastrous western Heaven's Gate (1980), before moving onto surprise audiences with his wonderful dance skills in Pennies from Heaven (1981), taking the lead as a school teacher with telepathic abilities in the Stephen King inspired The Dead Zone (1983) and then as billionaire industrialist Max Zorin trying to blow up Silicon Valley in the 007 adventure A View to a Kill (1985).Looking at many of Walken's other captivating screen roles, it is easy to see the diversity of his range and even his droll comedic talents with humorous appearances in Biloxi Blues (1988), Wayne's World 2 (1993), Joe Dirt (2001), Mousehunt (1997) and America's Sweethearts (2001). Most recently, he continued to surprise audiences again with his work as a heart broken and apologetic father to Leonardo DiCaprio in Catch Me If You Can (2002). Christopher Walken's talents continue to remain in high demand and movie audiences relish watching how capably he re-invents himself for each new challenging role.
Jerry Lewis influenced Walken to make show business his career. At age 10, he met Lewis on The Colgate Comedy Hour (1950), where Lewis and Dean Martin were guest hosts. Walken was an extra on the show and was in a skit with Lewis.
      Walken initially intended to study dancing instead of acting, but dropped out of Hofstra University after one year when he landed an off-Broadway musical "Best Foot Forward" in 1963.
      Ranked #96 in Empire (UK) magazine's "The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time" list. [October 1997]
      Was assaulted in a street in New York in 1980 when he asked two men to turn down their music. His nose was broken in the incident.
      Was robbed at the airport in Venice and his The Prophecy II (1998) script, glasses, keys, drivers licence, and $100 were stolen. All items were later found, except for the money.
      Manages to insert a little dance number into nearly all of his roles, no matter how small, scripted or not.
      Won an MTV Video Music Award for choreographing his own dancing in Fatboy Slim's 2001 music video "Weapon Of Choice", directed by Spike Jonze.

Later in the film, he has a student whom he's tutoring to read Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven." Later in life, Walken read the poem for an audio book.

      Along with Alec Baldwin, he has a standing invitation to host Saturday Night Live (1975) every year (if scheduling permits).
      When hosting Saturday Night Live (1975), he likes to sing during his monologues (which has become a crowd pleasing favorite). So naturally, when co-hosting SNL specials, his introduction song "I'm Walkin, Im 'Talkin" (for the rhyme of his last name) is played.
      Is only the second person in history to be nominated for both Best Supporting Actor from the Oscars, for Catch Me If You Can (2002), and Worst Supporting Actor from the Razzies, for The Country Bears (2002) in the same year. The first was James Coco, who was actually nominated for both awards for the same role in Only When I Laugh (1981).
      In his 35 years in film, he has acted in well over 90 films. He rarely turns down a part, under the belief that making movies (whether they turn out good or bad) is always a rewarding experience.
      Adopted the name "Christopher" when a friend told him the name suited him better than "Ronnie". Has since stated that his adopted name sounds "like a sneeze", and he prefers to be called "Chris".
      At the time of filming The Rundown (2003), he had never seen the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971), and was therefore reluctant to use the phrase "Oompah Loompah" in his final scene. When learning of this, director Peter Berg gave him a copy of the film, and he finally decided to use the phrase.
      Has played 3 different characters with the name Max in Kiss Toledo Goodbye (1999), Batman Returns (1992) and A View to a Kill (1985).
      Has different-colored eyes (one blue and one hazel). This is a condition known as heterochromia.

      A frequent host of Saturday Night Live (1975), he has also been parodied on the show by Jay Mohr. The youngest ever regular cast member was Anthony Michael Hall, who succeeded him in the television series based on The Dead Zone (1983), and who, like Walken, has appeared in the Batman film series.

      In both "The Stepford Wives" (2004) and "Click" (2006), portrays a man who hands over a sleek futuristic remote control with sci-fi capabilities.
      In 2009, he had the honor of interacting with the entire cast of Saturday Night Live (1975) at the time they were doing impersonations of him in a sketch called "Walken Family Reunion".
      His senior quote from high school (The Profesional Children's School) is from Shakespeare's "Love's Labours Lost" Act II, Scene I: - "the merry madcap lord - not a word with him but a jest; and every jest but a word".
      Wilton, Connecticut: lives there with his wife, Georgianne, and their cat, Bowtie [January 2013]
      As of 2014, has appeared in three films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: Annie Hall (1977), The Deer Hunter (1978) and Pulp Fiction (1994). Of those, Annie Hall (1977) and The Deer Hunter (1978) are winners in the category.
      If you want to learn how to build a house, build a house. Don't ask anybody, just build a house.
      I can't imagine being somebody else. And anything I play, my reference is completely from the planet Showbusiness. I don't know anything about anybody else, people that I've known all my life - my family, my brothers - I don't know... I only know about me.
      I think that a good movie creates its own world, and that world needn't refer to anything that's real. If it's consistent, if it's entertaining, if it's interesting, it justifies its being there.
      I always think that in movies or on stage, two people can be talking to each other - the audience doesn't necessarily have to know what they're talking about, just so long as they know that *you* know what you're talking about.
      I used to be prettier than I am, but I think I look better now. I was a pretty boy. Particularly in my early movies. I don't like looking at them so much. There's a sort of pretty thing about me.
      I've enjoyed making movies for lots of different reasons. Sometimes, it was the other people. Sometimes, it was the fact that I was really good in it. Sometimes, it was the location. Sometimes, it was the paycheck. Sometimes, it can be lots of different things, or a lot of those things. Or there can be reasons why you'd like to avoid it the next time. Like the jungle. I've made a couple of movies in the jungle, and I don't want to go back to the jungle.
      Back home, I do the same things every day. Exactly the same. I eat at the same time, I get up at the same time, I do the same things in the same order. I read. I have coffee. Then I study my scripts, I exercise on the treadmill, I make myself a little something to eat. I am a great believer in the Mediterranean diet.
      Careers are not often as chosen as people think they are. People talk to me about my choices. I don't make choices, hardly. Things happen, and you say yes or no - usually 'yes', because it's always better to do something. What's the choice? Somebody will say, 'Don't do that part, you don't need to do that part.' And I'll say, 'Why not? What am I going to do? Sit around the house? I'd much rather go to work, and see actors, and have fun.
      I believe in saving money. I believe in having a house. I believe in keeping things clean. I believe in exercising. Slow and steady is a very good thing for me. It works for me.
      [on how he selects his acting roles] I don't choose that much. I just sort of take what's there. I don't have much else to do. I don't have a lot of hobbies. I don't play golf. I don't have any children. Things that occupy people's time. I just try to take jobs. I basically work so much because I'm lazy.
      [on guns] I don't even like holding them. Whenever I hold a gun, I want to get it out of my hand as quick as possible.
      I don't particularly like to do anything dangerous. And here I was in Bangkok [filming The Deer Hunter (1978)]. I was in the jungle and in the mountains. Being an actor has taken me places that I never would have gone to . . . It's been a very interesting life.
      I eat the same things all the time: fish, hardly ever meat. Chicken, vegetables. I'm fond of steamed sea bass over leeks. I don't drink hard liquor. I like wine.
      [on his routine] I get up early, at six or seven, and have coffee. I usually read in the morning. And then, if I have a script, I do that for a while. Then I exercise at a certain time. About noon. I like to cook, so usually, I'll be making something. And I have my script. My favorite thing is to have two scripts. It's great to study two things at the same time.
      I have been in movies that I thought I wasn't very good in. I think, "Chris, don't let your mouth hang open like that next time. Look at that facial tic. Don't walk in such a self-conscious way!" But sometimes, I watch myself and I think that I am terrific--and that is really nice.
      I have this theory about words. There's a thousand ways to say "Pass the salt". It could mean, you know, "Can I have some salt?" or it could mean, "I love you.". It could mean, "I'm very annoyed with you". Really, the list could go on and on. Words are little bombs, and they have a lot of energy inside them.
      {On Pulp Fiction (1994)] I put aside an hour every day to go over that monologue again and again for months, and every time I got to the end of it, I would crack up.
      I was already 35 years old, and I'd been in show business for 30-plus years, and suddenly there was this big movie and I was getting an Oscar, and this enormous thing happened. In Annie Hall (1977), I played the strange brother who wanted to drive into oncoming cars. Immediately after that was The Deer Hunter (1978), where I played this nice guy who shoots himself in the head. Something happened there. The fact that they came so close together, and they were both important movies, two big public things where I was simultaneously . . . "disturbed". That got the ball rolling for me in terms of being an actor.
      I won't do commercials either.  I don't want to sell anything.  As an actor, it's tricky.  You have this platform and it has to do with your face, your charisma.  It's tricky when you endorse something because people are liable to believe you.  Be careful.
      I would like to be a very old man and still be acting. So I feel lucky to have stuck around for this long. You have to be good and all that, but you also have to be lucky. I guess in everything. But especially if you're an actor. So I got no complaints.
      I'm serious. I do not like the unknown or the unexpected. I cannot stand being surprised, yet as an actor I like surprise. I get very upset if my bills aren't paid immediately.
      I've always been a character actor, although I'm not quite sure what that means. All my scripts are absolutely covered in notes, so any time I say anything - even "pass the salt" - I have six subtexts, comments on what I really mean when I'm saying that. Maybe that's what gives the impression that I'm saying one thing and thinking something else.
      {on what makes him choose parts] Lots of things. The script, the directors, the location, the actors, how much are they going to pay me? How long is it going to take?
      [on if he does research to prepare for a role] No. The soul is in the words, comes from the words, not research. [Research is] useless, waste of time. And exhausting. I just don't know how to do it. I only know my own experiences. People are completely mysterious to me. Even in my own family I have no idea what any of them are thinking.
      There were years when I didn't do anything but collect unemployment. I worked a lot, but I worked for nothing. I worked for 15 years as a kind of janitor at the Actors Studio. I would do manual things. I did lots of plays, theater workshops, for nothing.
      [on how he memorizes lines and prepares for a role] What I do has a lot to do with the words. My favorite thing is to have two scripts at the same time, and study them simultaneously in the kitchen. Go over the words, over and over, do them different ways, different inflections and rhythms. For me, rhythm is very important. I think we express ourselves as much with rhythm as with the words. It's not what you say, it's how you say it. I think it's very true. If you start to say your lines and it sounds right, usually I stick with that. If it sounds right, it probably is right. It's curious, how you're not collaborating with anyone at that point, and by the time you get there with other actors on the set, usually what you've done at home makes sense, and it's acceptable to everybody. The thing I have trouble with, because I'm so dependent on knowing my lines, is that if suddenly somebody says, "Here's a big speech. You're going to do that instead," I get lost. At that point, I understand why Marlon Brando loves cue cards.
      What I used to do was, I'd get the script and see who the character was - a spy, a lumberjack, whatever - then I'd try to dress the part for the audition, to give the impression that I was tough or funny or whatever the part seemed to call for. That was always a disaster. I would never get the job. If I learned anything it's not to do anything like that. Now if they want to look at me, I go in and let them look at me. Let them figure out their own reasons for why they'd want to hire me.
      [on why he hates not to be working] When I don't have any work sometimes, a kind of thing sets in where my mind shuts down. It's almost like hibernation. It's not that I'm unhappy, but I'm not thinking anything. Then I'll go and watch television. And after an hour or two, I'll think, "You're just sitting there watching television and it's not even interesting". And there's nothing to do. Life becomes meaningless.
      With stage fright you keep on doing it and eventually the fear goes away. If you stick around long enough you become very hard to intimidate. It is very difficult to make me nervous about working these days. There have been so many times when I thought I was finished, but it was not true - you just keep going. I am scared of sickness, pollution and crazy people but, work-wise, there is nothing to frighten me.
      {On his process of acting] You know. it's really tricky. People have no idea. How do you do it? Most of the time I don't. I mean, I can't. You just do it as well as you can. And, hopefully, you did some good stuff here and some good stuff there. The best part is going home in the car at the end of the day, and thinking, "I was good".
      People think that my favorite roles to do are villains, but I find comedy to be the most challenging and rewarding.
      I would make a very bad killer in real life because I don't think I could even pick up a gun, much less actually shoot one. Guns make me very nervous. They're dangerous. I'm more of a pacifist than anyone could imagine.
      [on Quentin Tarantino] Movie scripts are usually pretty loose - things usually change a lot. But not with Quentin. His scripts are absolutely huge. All dialogue. It's all written down. You just learn the lines. It's more like a play.
      Me and Dennis Hopper, when we were doing that scene in True Romance (1993), it was hilarious. It really was - including shooting him. All that laughing was real. He was killing me. And all the guys around us - that was a very cracking-up day.
      Golf. My God, that's a mysterious occupation. I know people who are - good friends - who are absolutely smitten, practicing their swing and talking about it. I can understand some sort of sport where your body got a benefit, like marathon running or bicycle racing. That's not golf. And not only that, but the whole business of standing in the sun - my God. That's like torture.
      When I was a kid, there was someone in my family, an adult, and whenever I saw them, they would say, "You got a lotta nerve." From the time I was a little kid, it was always like, "Heh, heh, heh - you got a lotta nerve." I always thought, What does that mean? But then when I got older, I thought that it was an instruction. If you tell a kid something, it sticks. I think I do have a lot of nerve. But, I mean, I think I maybe got it from that person who said it to me.
      There's something dangerous about what's funny. Jarring and disconcerting. There is a connection between funny and scary.
      They say that the human smile is in fact one of those primordial things - that in fact it's a showing of teeth, that it's a warning. That when we smile, in a primeval way it has to do with fear.
      Sometimes I look at this watch and I think, "There's some guy that puts these little screws in there?" There is something about it. I'm not into cars, either, but there is something about a really magnificent car.
      It all happened when I did The Deer Hunter (1978)]. Suddenly - I'd already been in show business for thirty years, and nothing much had happened. I mean, I really was laboring in obscurity, and then suddenly this movie. It was kind of infectious, and I really did become rather social. Gregarious. And that lasted, I don't know, ten years.
      I had an agent when I first got into the movies who said to me, "You're gonna be in Los Angeles now once in a while. If somebody invites you to a party, don't go. Stay in your room, go to the movies." And I have a feeling I know sort of what he meant: Don't show your face around too much. Let 'em be a little glad to see you.
      When you're onstage and you know you're bombing, that's very, very scary. Because you know you gotta keep going - you're bombing, but you can't stop. And you know that half an hour from now, you're still gonna be bombing. It takes a thick skin.
      I love spaghetti. And I like to cook spaghetti. And I used to eat it every day. I weighed thirty pounds more than I do now. You can't - you can't do that. Ice cream - I love to watch television and eat ice cream. But that's like a ten-year-old. I can't do that anymore. Beer. Beer, spaghetti, ice cream.
      I always figured that if I'm gonna be playing these people, that there should be this relationship to the audience that is very clear. "That's Chris, and look at Chris having a good time, wanting to take over the world and sink California and shoot everybody in the room" - just so long as they understand that that's Chris on the set having fun. And that Chris wouldn't really do anything like that.
      Most of the jobs I get are basically very unwholesome people. There's always something wrong with the guy, and sometimes something deeply wrong. I'm tired of that. I tell my agent I want a Fred MacMurray part. I want a part where I have a wife and kids and a dog and a house, and my kids say to me, "What do you think I should do, Dad?" and I say, "Be careful."
      I used to love Danish. My father used to make a Boston cream pie. You never see that anymore. Very good.
      My father was a lesson. He had his own bakery, and it was closed one day a week, but he would go anyway. He did it because he really loved his bakery. It wasn't a job.
      That's supposed to be a fact, that the question mark is originally from an Egyptian hieroglyph that signified a cat walking away. You know, it's the tail. And that symbol meant - well, whatever it is when they're ignoring you.
      I remember once, years ago, I was walking out a door - I'd been having a conversation and I was walking out the door, and this guy said to me, "Chris," and I stopped and I turned, and he said, "Be careful." And I never forgot that. And it comes back to me often: Be careful. That was good advice.
      Well, I missed the boat on computers. I think I was really just on the cusp. If I had been a little bit younger, I probably would have a computer. But when they came along, it looked so boring to me that I just never bothered. But also when something is ubiquitous, it's almost redundant. I don't have a wristwatch either because if I need to know what time it is, I ask somebody. I got stuck in an airport a while ago, and I always carry quarters so that I can use the payphone, and I tried all these payphones and they just didn't work. I guess nobody uses them anymore. And somebody asked: "Would you like to use my cell phone?" There are enough of them around. If I need to know something about something, I say to my wife: "Can you check this out on your computer", and she comes back within ten minutes with the information. I use it, I just don't have it.
      [on taking clothes from movie sets] For example, [Batman Returns (1992)], when I was shooting it I got very interesting clothes and accessories. On my last day of shooting I had already thought a long time about what I would like to take with me. I had some beautiful cuff links. When I had finished my last scene and went back to my dressing room everything was already gone. Everything!
      My weakness as a director was if somebody would ask me something I'd say, "Just do whatever you want". My impression is that a director must be a little like a general. You'd hate me to be running a war because I wouldn't know what anybody is doing.
      There are just certain roles - well, they never ask me to play the guy that gets the girl, even though I've been married for 41 years now, so I did get the girl.
      {On his home in Wilton, CT] At night I have possums, skunks, lots of raccoons. They come right in the house, through the cat door, and they bring their babies in. I get up at night and they're in the kitchen, eating all the cat food.
      [In 1993] I never was a big fan of school, to tell you the truth. I never had kids, but I suspect if I did, I wouldn't encourage them to go to school. I never liked it myself. I was always grateful for being taught to read. I figured that once that had been done for me, that's the big thing. A little bit of adding, subtracting, multiplying, that sort of thing. And you have to learn to write, at least a letter. But beyond that, I think people are over-educated. I think education will come if you want it. I read what I want to read, so that's what I know about. You can't know everything, so you should concentrate on what you're interested in. The whole concept of general education-I think it makes for vague minds.
      I use punctuation, but I finish the sentence and put [in] a period but it's not necessarily where somebody else would. I think everybody should talk the way they want. You go to school and you all sit there and all learn to do the same thing. I guess it's necessary but it's too bad also, in a way. Kids, you know, get kind of restrained in a lot of ways. I probably wouldn't get a job as an English teacher.
      When it's wet, I stick it up with some gunk and walk around and let the air dry it and then it stays there. I have good hair. I have a lot of hair. Whatever I do must be good for it, because I've still got so much. Every time I meet guys I went to school with, they've got no hair.
      If somebody were to do the story of my life, not that anybody would, it would be about my wife and me around the house. It would be like watching paint dry.
      [on his style] Garish. Especially when I was younger -- I was always a bit exotic. Never wore a hat because the hair was more important.
      I asked this girl to go to the prom and she said she would but that she had a boyfriend, an older guy. Then she took out her wallet and showed me a picture of this handsome guy with the hair, the teeth, who looked like a Greek statue. I thought, All right, and then I asked to see it again and said, "This is not a photograph. You cut this out of a magazine." She got farmisht and said, "Yes, you're right, I did. I'm so madly in love with him. His name is Elvis Presley." She went with me to the prom. I had her in a compromising position. That's what you get for lying.
      [on airports] I can't stand going to the airport. I avoid it as much as I can. I just can't stand it, it's really an ordeal. And if it's an international flight, and you have to fill out those immigration cards? Stay home!
      [on making "Weapon of Choice"] I had made a musical called Pennies from Heaven (1981). The director of the video, Spike Jonze, saw that and said, 'Christopher can dance. Ask him to do the video.' I rehearsed the dance every day for three weeks with the choreographer. Then, we went to the location. We shot very quickly. I think we made the whole thing in 12 hours.
      [rules to live by] Take care of yourself - eat good, sleep, not too much stress. Don't be greedy!
      [on playing Stanley in 'A Streetcar Named Desire'] When I screamed ''Stella!' they couldn't stop laughing.
      [on what some see as quirky vibes in his performances] I was, in a sense, raised by musical-comedy people: gypsies, comics. It makes you almost from another country. And I think that in movies that strangeness almost easily translates into menacing or malevolent. When people do my voice and imitate me, I think it's almost that they're making fun of my accent. I grew up with people who spoke English as a second language. It could be I have an accent.
      [on acting] There's a playpen aspect. When it's good, it's always there. You're a bit like kids, and you're in a sandbox, and you're making it up - or you think you are. A good director really is like a lifeguard. He sits on a big chair and he's got all these crazy kids in the sandbox and they're playing. Every once in a while, one of them slips or falls out of the sandbox or whatever, and a good director just picks him up and puts him back inside and proceeds.
      My life is anything but eccentric. I've been married for forty-six years and I pay all my bills, and I live in a house where the lawn is always cut and I'm nice to my cat.
      Somebody once said that 80 percent of directing actors is casting them in the first place. So you hope that they hired you because you have some particular quality that is going to be useful to them in the movie. Good directors usually hire you and then they kind of leave you alone.
      [on protecting Bonny the dog from Seven Pychopaths at the Toronto International Film Festival] There was this huge guy standing next to me yelling, 'Let me pick her up.' And I'm protecting the dog, thinking, 'If you touch that dog, I will crack you right in the face.'
      When I was a kid my parents gave me piano lessons and guitar lessons for a while, but I was never very good at it. I have big, sort of awkward hands. It's hard to keep going when you don't get any better.
      Males in all nature, they have their plumage. I always think of my hair as a kind of attention-getting device. You know, it basically says, 'Look at me,' and if you're in show business, that's not such a bad thing. It might be difficult if I worked in an office.
      I really just stay home, except when I go to work... so in that sense I suppose I'm a regular guy.
=======================================================
He worked as a lion tamer and dreamed of finding fame through dancing but his edgy charm led to decades of success on stage and screen, from The Deer Hunter to Catch Me If You Can.
Christopher Walken got his taste for acting at an early age by being an extra on live programmes filmed in New York.
Whilst studying at the Professional Children’s School in Manhattan, he took the decision to specialise in dance.
In 1963, he was offered a role in the Broadway musical ‘Best Foot Forward’ alongside Liza Minnelli, and following this he worked mainly as a dancer in a number of different musicals.
His first major acting role was as King Philip in ‘The Lion in Winter’ in 1966 and, after a rocky start, he went on to win the Clarence Derwent Award. While he continued to work in theatre, it wasn’t until he played Duane Hall in Woody Allen's ‘Annie Hall’ that he reached a major audience.
Walken’s role in ‘The Deer Hunter’ did wonders for his career thanks to the 1978 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Following the award, he appeared in a vast number of high profile films such as ‘A View to a Kill’, ‘Batman Returns’, ‘True Romance’ and ‘Pulp Fiction’.
A part in MGM’s last ever musical, ‘Pennies from Heaven’, gave Walken a chance to show off his dancing talents once again. He was later praised by both Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly for his performance in the film.
Walken has also tried his hand as a playwright with his satirical account of the afterlife of Elvis called ‘Him’. Refusing to be pigeon-holed into the role of actor, he also enjoys comedy and has hosted ‘Saturday Night Live’ six times, winning a 2001 American Comedy Award.
Despite often playing villains, Christopher Walken says he is “happily married, owns two homes and a station wagon, and pays his bills on time”.
Walken has also attracted a strong cult following during his long career. This stems from his appearance in genre films by directors such as David Cronenberg, Tim Burton and Quentin Tarantino. It may also stem from his odd appearance, quirky mannerisms, and ability to exude menace.
Walken is one of the most imitated men in Hollywood, with entertainers such as Johnny Depp, Robin Williams, Eddie Izzard and Kevin Spacey having tried their hands at his deadpan mannerisms.
He has appeared in music videos for artists ranging from Madonna to Fatboy Slim, with the latter's 'Weapon Of Choice' earning him the VH1 Award for Best Actor in a Music Video in 2001.
One of his most famous Saturday Night Live sketches is a spoof of documentary series 'Behind the Music' depicting the Blue Oyster Cult. Walken plays fictional producer Bruce Dickinson, who is obsessed with getting "more cowbell" into the song.
Walken's acting credentials have won him a place in Empire magazine's list of the Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time, as well as prestigious theatre prizes such as the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical.
He also has the philosophy that one should never turn down a film role, whether the project seems good or bad, as making a movie is always a rewarding experience.
Right, so: now that we’ve convinced you Lifetime is a thing you need to have in your life – what now? How do you get this on your telly? Here’s what you have to do.

'I look at that beach and I can tell you where each one was lying...   I can still see their faces': Tears of D-Day veterans as they make emotional return to Normandy to honour their fallen comrades
A royal salute for the fallen heroes of D-Day: Prince Charles and an elegant Duchess of Cornwall join the Queen to pay their respects
        70 years after they stormed Normandy's beaches as young soldiers amid the hell of battle, veterans willing to die for freedom in 1944 have made an emotional return to France. Harold Baumgarten, 89, has described how he could still look out at the beaches of northern France and point to where the bodies lay. Other men like Peter Smooth, 89, left, went to the British War Cemetery in Bayeux to salute fallen comrades. Other told their stories to dignitaries like Prime Minister David Cameron, top right. Across the Channel Douglas Turtle, 91, bottom right, sobbed on the seafront in Portsmouth as he remembered June 6 1944 at dawn.

       World leaders gathered in Normandy to mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day amid growing tensions over Russian aggression towards Ukraine. Mr Putin is due to come face-to-face with the Prince of Wales later. As heads of state gathered for a group photo to mark  D-Day at Benouville Castle, Mr Putin cut a solitary figure while Barack Obama and New Zealand's Governor-General Jerry Mateparae fussed around the Queen.

A versatile character actor whose intense demeanor and slightly off-kilter delivery  served him well in both comedies and dramas, Christopher Walken was at once one of the busiest and most respected actors of his generation, appearing in as many as five films in a year while still finding time for stage and occasional television work. Walken was born Ronald Walken in Queens, NY, on March 31, 1943, the youngest of three sons of Paul and Rosalie Walken; Paul ran a bakery, while Rosalie was convinced her sons had talent and was determined they take advantage of it. Ronald landed his first job in front of a camera at the age of 14 months when he posed for a calendar photo with a pair of kittens. Like his siblings, he received dance lessons as a youngster, and, by the age of ten, was making frequent appearances on television and radio shows, and was a regular on a short-lived sitcom, The Wonderful John Acton. Ronald and his brothers also enrolled at New York's Professional Children's School, and he spent a summer as a junior lion tamer with a circus, later recalling that the lion was quite old and docile. In 1961, Walken enrolled at Hofstra University. But, little more than a year later, he landed a role in the Broadway-bound musical Best Foot Forward (which starred one of his former classmates, Liza Minelli), and decided to leave college. Spending the next several years working in a variety of musicals -- both in New York and on the road -- the young actor appeared in a 1964 touring production of West Side Story, and there met actress and dancer Georgianne Thon. The two began dating, and eventually married in 1969. While appearing in a revue starring model-turned-singer Monique Van Vooren in 1965, Walken was told by the headliner he looked more like a Christopher than a Ronald; he decided to take her advice, and adopted Christopher Walken as his stage name. In 1966, he made his first appearance in a non-singing role as Phillip, the King of France, in a Broadway production of The Lion in Winter. By the end of the decade, Walken was devoting his energies to stage dramas, although he continued to keep up with his dance training. Walken made his movie debut with 1968's Me and My Brother -- a film directed by acclaimed photographer and experimental filmmaker Robert Frank -- and, in 1972, scored his first starring role in the low-budget sci-fi thriller The Mind Snatchers. Walken first caught the attention of critics with his performance as a bohemian ladies' man in Paul Mazursky's Next Stop, Greenwich Village, and landed a small but memorable role in Woody Allen's Annie Hall as suicidal preppie Duane. But Walken's real breakthrough came in 1978, with his role as Nick in The Deer Hunter. Playing a small-town boy who is irreversibly scarred by his experiences in Vietnam, the role won Walken an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and made him a bankable and recognizable name. He soon committed to director Michael Cimino's follow-up, which proved to be the infamous box-office and critically-panned flop Heaven's Gate, and later showed off both his acting and dancing skills as a villainous pimp in the musical drama Pennies From Heaven.  While Walken remained a critical favorite, he fell short of becoming a major box-office draw due to the disappointing returns of many of his post-Deer Hunter films. But, by his own admission, Walken was always an actor who liked to work, and he maintained a busy schedule of both stage and screen roles. His willingness to take on edgy film characters with questionable commercial appeal (such as At Close Range, King of New York, and Communion) helped earn the actor a loyal cult following, and small but showy roles in True Romance and Pulp Fiction gave Walken's screen career a serious boost in the early '90s. By the time Walken turned 60, he had written, directed, and starred in an off-Broadway comedy called Him; received another Oscar nomination for his performance in Catch Me if You Can; appeared in films as varied as Sleepy Hollow, The Affair of the Necklace, and The Country Bears; and got to prove he was still a great dancer with his much-talked-about appearance in the music video "Weapon of Choice" by Fatboy Slim. Walken became one of the most popular recurring guest-hosts on Saturday Night Live creating recurring characters such as The Continental, and appeared in a host of classic skits including getting to deliver the catch phrase, "I need more cowbell!" As the 2000s progressed, Walken continued to take work in a variety of films from The Rundown, and Man on Fire, to Gigli, The Wedding Crashers, and the Adam Sandler comedy Click, all the while maintaining his status as one of the quirkiest and most gifted supporting actors of his time. In 2006 he took on a supporting role opposite Robin Williams in the Barry Levinson directed satire Man of the Year as a political consultant. He was in the musical remake of Hairspray, playing the husband of the character played by John Travolta in drag, and the comedy   Balls of Fury in 2007. In 2010 he earned rave reviews for his work in the Martin McDonagh's play A Behanding in Spokane on Broadway, and the next year he worked with Todd Solondz, playing the father in Dark Horse. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

Christopher WalkenAKA Ronald Christopher WalkenBorn: 31-Mar-1943Birthplace: Astoria, NYGender: MaleRace or Ethnicity: WhiteSexual orientation: StraightOccupation: ActorNationality: United StatesExecutive summary: The Dead ZoneChristopher Walken is one of the weirdest American actors, with unmistakably stoic mannerisms, delivery, and voice, and a face that seems to hold no emotion, or all emotions. He shot to fame playing Russian roulette in The Deer Hunter.
Walken's parents were both immigrants. His father, a baker from Germany, ran Walken's Bakery in Queens. His mother, an amateur actress from Scotland, gave up her own on-stage ambitions, but noticed there were opportunities in New York for cute children as models, and in TV shows and commercials. Mr. and Mrs. Walken had three cute children, Christopher, Kenneth, and Glenn, and their paychecks helped the family make ends meet. All three appeared on television shows, on Broadway, and in the movies, but only Christopher made it his career.
Young Christopher, or "Ronnie Walken", as he was often credited, was a dancer at first. In those days, most of TV's many variety shows featured dancing, and Walken worked with Milton Berle, Ernie Kovacs, Sid Caesar, Jerry Lewis, and other giants of that era. As a boy, Walken was off-stage, watching Lewis perform live on television, when he decided he would be a performer all his life.
Walken made his Broadway debut at 15 in 1958, playing a lion tamer and working with a live lion in J.B., directed by Elia Kazan. He went to Hofstra University, but dropped out after a year when he was cast opposite Liza Minnelli in the play Best Foot Forward. In 1964, he appeared in a Broadway production of High Spirits directed by Noel Coward. His film debut was in Me and My Brother (1968), with Allen Ginsberg, in which Walken borrowed his father's German accent and shouted directions to an actor auditioning to play a catatonic-schizophrenic.
At some point, Walken developed an aversion to traditional punctuation. He's said that he would sometimes cross out punctuation marks in textbooks, and he still crosses out punctuation in his scripts today. Instead, he's explained that he reads scripts and speaks his lines with a dancer's cadence in his mind, sort of vocally "dancing" the lines. The words come out in Walken's signature style, often parodied by impressionists, to Walken's own delight.
In 1969, while in a touring production of West Side Story, Walken  met and married another dancer, Georgianne Thon. She is now a Hollywood casting director, whose name is in the credits for several movies every year, as well as in The Sopranos.
In 1981, while filming the underrated science fiction film Brainstorm, Walken was invited aboard a yacht with his co-star Natalie Wood and her husband Robert Wagner. Off the coast of Catalina Island, Wood fell overboard and drowned. Rumors of foul play or a love triangle of Wagner, Walken and Wood have persisted, but Walken says the truth is much sadder and more boring, as accidents usually are. She simply slipped.
Walken's other famous roles include the dancing pimp in Pennies from Heaven, the man with visions in The Dead Zone, Whitley Strieber, abducted by aliens in Communion, the soulless mobster in King of New York, a lonely farmer in Sarah, Plain and Tall, the part that didn't suck in Batman Returns, the mobster who laughed at Dennis Hopper's insults in True Romance, the angel Gabriel in The Prophecy,  the slimeball record producer in Wayne's World 2, a soldier with a watch up his ass in Pulp Fiction, The Hessian Horseman in Sleepy Hollow, and a man with a plan in The Stepford Wives.Father: Paul Walken (baker, d.
