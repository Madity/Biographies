Meryl Streep (born Mary Louise Streep; June 22, 1949)[2] is an American actress of theater, film and television. She is widely regarded as one of the greatest actresses of all time.[3][4][5]
Streep made her professional stage debut in The Playboy of Seville (1971), before her screen debut in the television movie The Deadliest Season (1977). In that same year, she made her film debut in Julia (1977). Both critical and commercial success came quickly with roles in The Deer Hunter (1978) and Kramer vs. Kramer (1979), the first of which brought her an Academy Award nomination, and the second, her first win, for Best Supporting Actress. She later won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her roles in Sophie's Choice (1982) and The Iron Lady (2011). With 18 Academy Award nominations in 35 years, Streep holds the record as being the most nominated actor (male or female) in history.
Streep has also received 28 Golden Globe nominations, winning eight, more nominations and more competitive (non-honorary) wins than any other actor (male or female) in history. [6] Her work has also earned her two Emmy Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Cannes Film Festival award, five New York Film Critics Circle Awards, two BAFTA awards, two Australian Film Institute awards, five Grammy Award nominations, and a Tony Award nomination, among several others. She was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2004 and the Kennedy Center Honor in 2011 for her contribution to American culture through performing arts, the youngest actor in each award's history. President Barack Obama awarded her the 2010 National Medal of Arts. In 2003, the government of France made her a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters.
Streep was born in Summit, New Jersey.[7] Her mother, Mary Wolf (née Wilkinson; 1915–2001), was a commercial artist and an art editor, and her father, Harry William Streep, Jr. (1910–2003), was a pharmaceutical executive.[8][9][10] She has two brothers, Dana David and Harry William III.[11]
Streep's father was of German and Swiss-German ancestry. Her patrilineal line traces back to Loffenau, Germany, from where her second great-grandfather, Gottfried Streeb (sic), emigrated to the United States, and where one of her ancestors served as mayor. Another line of her father's family was from Giswil in the canton of Obwalden, a small town in Switzerland. Her mother had English, German, and Irish ancestry. Some of Streep's maternal ancestors lived in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, and were descended from 17th century immigrants from England.[10][12] Her eighth great-grandfather, Lawrence Wilkinson, was one of the first Europeans to settle Rhode Island. Streep is also a distant relative of William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, and records show that her family is among the first purchasers of land in the state. Streep's maternal great-grandparents, Manus McFadden (b. 1831) and Grace Strain (b. 1832), were natives of the Hook Head district of Dunfanaghy, County Donegal, Ireland.[12][13][14][15]
She was raised a Presbyterian,[16][17] and grew up in Bernardsville, New Jersey, where she attended Bernards High School.[18] She had many school friends who were Catholic, and regularly attended Mass because she loved its rituals.[19] She received her B.A., in Drama, from Vassar College in 1971 (where she briefly received instruction from actress Jean Arthur), but also enrolled as a visiting student at Dartmouth College a quarter before it became coeducational. She subsequently earned an M.F.A. from the Yale School of Drama. While at Yale, she played a variety of roles onstage,[20] from Helena in A Midsummer Night's Dream to an eighty-year-old woman in a wheelchair in a comedy written by then-unknown playwrights Christopher Durang and Albert Innaurato.[21][22][23]
Streep performed in several theater productions in New York and New Jersey after graduating from Yale School of Drama,[24] including the New York Shakespeare Festival productions of Henry V, The Taming of the Shrew with Raúl Juliá, and Measure for Measure opposite Sam Waterston and John Cazale. At this time she entered a relationship with Cazale, with whom she lived until his death three years later. She starred on Broadway in the Brecht/Weill musical Happy End, and won an Obie for her performance in the all-sung off-Broadway production of Alice at the Palace.
Streep began auditioning for film roles, and later recalled an unsuccessful audition for Dino De Laurentiis for the leading female role in King Kong. [25] In New York City, she appeared in the 1976 Broadway double bill of Tennessee Williams' 27 Wagons Full of Cotton and Arthur Miller's A Memory of Two Mondays. For the former, she received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Play. Her other early Broadway credits include Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard and the Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill musical Happy End in which she originally appeared off-Broadway at the Chelsea Theater Center. She received Drama Desk Award nominations for both productions.
Streep's first feature film role was Julia (1977), in which she played a small but pivotal role during a flashback scene. Streep was living in New York City with Cazale, who had been diagnosed with bone cancer.[26] He was cast in The Deer Hunter (1978), and Streep was delighted to secure a small role because it allowed her to remain with Cazale for the duration of filming. She was not specifically interested in the part, commenting, "They needed a girl between the two guys and I was it."[27]
She played a leading role in the television miniseries Holocaust (1978) as a German woman married to a Jewish artist in Nazi era Germany. She later explained that she had considered the material to be "unrelentingly noble",[27] and had taken the role only because she had needed money.[28] Streep travelled to Germany and Austria for filming while Cazale remained in New York. Upon her return, Streep found that Cazale's illness had progressed, and she nursed him until his death on March 12, 1978. She spoke of her grief and her hope that work would provide a diversion; she accepted a role in The Seduction of Joe Tynan (1979) with Alan Alda, later commenting that she played it on "automatic pilot",[27] and performed the role of Katherine in The Taming of the Shrew for Shakespeare in the Park.[29] With an estimated audience of 109 million, Holocaust brought a degree of public recognition to Streep, who was described in August 1978 as "on the verge of national visibility".[28] She won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress – Miniseries or a Movie[30] for her performance.
The Deer Hunter (1978) was released a month later, and Streep was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.
Streep played a supporting role in Manhattan (1979) for Woody Allen, later stating that she had not seen a complete script and was given only the six pages of her own scenes,[31] and that she had not been permitted to improvise a word of her dialogue.[32] Asked to comment on the script for Kramer vs. Kramer (1979), in a meeting with the producer Stan Jaffee, director Robert Benton and star Dustin Hoffman, Streep insisted that the female character was not representative of many real women who faced marriage breakdown and child custody battles, and was written as "too evil".[27] Jaffee, Benton and Hoffman agreed with Streep, and the script was revised.[27] In preparing for the part, Streep spoke to her own mother about her life as a mother and housewife with a career,[33] and frequented the Upper East Side neighborhood in which the film was set.[27] Benton allowed Streep to write her dialogue in two of her key scenes, despite some objection from Hoffman.[34] Jaffee and Hoffman later spoke of Streep's tirelessness, with Hoffman commenting, "She's extraordinarily hardworking, to the extent that she's obsessive. I think that she thinks about nothing else but what she's doing."[35]
Streep drew critical acclaim for her performance in each of her three films released in 1979: the romantic comedy Manhattan, the political drama The Seduction of Joe Tynan and the family drama, Kramer vs. Kramer.[24] She was awarded the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress, National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress and National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress for her collective work in the three films. Among the awards won for Kramer vs. Kramer were the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress.[24]
After supporting roles in two of the 1970s' most successful films, the consecutive winners of the Academy Award for Best Picture, The Deer Hunter and Kramer vs. Kramer, and praise for her versatility in several supporting roles, Streep progressed to leading roles. Her first was The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981). A story within a story drama, the film paired Streep with Jeremy Irons as contemporary actors, telling their modern story as well as the Victorian era drama they were performing. A New York Magazine article commented that, while many female stars of the past had cultivated a singular identity in their films, Streep was a "chameleon", willing to play any type of role.[36] Streep was awarded a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her work.
Her next film, the psychological thriller, Still of the Night (1982) reunited her with Robert Benton, the director of Kramer vs. Kramer, and co-starred Roy Scheider and Jessica Tandy. Vincent Canby, writing for The New York Times, noted that the film was an homage to the works of Alfred Hitchcock, but that one of its main weaknesses was a lack of chemistry between Streep and Scheider, concluding that Streep "is stunning, but she's not on screen anywhere near long enough".[37]
As the Polish holocaust survivor in Sophie's Choice (1982), Streep's emotional dramatic performance and her apparent mastery of a Polish accent drew praise.[24] William Styron wrote the novel with Ursula Andress in mind for the part of Sophie, but Streep was very determined to get the role. After she obtained a pirated copy of the script, she went to Alan J. Pakula and threw herself on the ground begging him to give her the part.."[citation needed] Streep filmed the "choice" scene in one take and refused to do it again, as she found shooting the scene extremely painful and emotionally exhausting.[38] Among several notable acting awards, Streep won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance. Roger Ebert said of her performance, "Streep plays the Brooklyn scenes with an enchanting Polish-American accent (she has the first accent I've ever wanted to hug), and she plays the flashbacks in subtitled German and Polish. There is hardly an emotion that Streep doesn't touch in this movie, and yet we're never aware of her straining. This is one of the most astonishing and yet one of the most unaffected and natural performances I can imagine."[citation needed]
She followed this success with a biographical film, Silkwood (1983), in which she played her first real-life character, the union activist Karen Silkwood. She discussed her preparation for the role in an interview with Roger Ebert and said that she had met with people close to Silkwood to learn more about her, and in doing so realized that each person saw a different aspect of Silkwood.[39] Streep concentrated on the events of Silkwood's life and concluded, "I didn't try to turn myself into Karen. I just tried to look at what she did. I put together every piece of information I could find about her... What I finally did was look at the events in her life, and try to understand her from the inside."[39]
Her next films were a romantic drama, Falling in Love (1984) opposite Robert De Niro, and a British drama, Plenty (1985). Roger Ebert said of Streep's performance in Plenty that she conveyed "great subtlety; it is hard to play an unbalanced, neurotic, self-destructive woman, and do it with such gentleness and charm... Streep creates a whole character around a woman who could have simply been a catalogue of symptoms."[40]
Out of Africa (1985) starred Streep as the Danish writer Karen Blixen and co-starred Robert Redford. A significant critical success, the film received a 63% "fresh" rating from Rotten Tomatoes.[41] Streep co-starred with Jack Nicholson in her next two films, the dramas Heartburn (1986) and Ironweed (1987), in which she sang onscreen for the first time since the television movie, Secret Service, in 1977. In A Cry in the Dark, aka Evil Angels (1988), she played the biographical role of Lindy Chamberlain, an Australian woman who had been convicted of the murder of her infant daughter despite Chamberlain claiming the baby had been taken by a dingo (a claim that was later vindicated). Filmed in Australia, Streep won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, a Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival, the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress and was nominated for several other awards for her portrayal of Chamberlain.
In She-Devil (1989), Streep played her first comedic film role, opposite Roseanne Barr. Richard Corliss, writing for Time, commented that Streep was the "one reason" to see the film and observed that it marked a departure from the type of role for which she had been known, saying, "Surprise! Inside the Greer Garson roles Streep usually plays, a vixenish Carole Lombard is screaming to be cut loose."[42]
In the 1990s, Streep continued to play a great variety of roles. From 1984 to 1990, she won six People's Choice Awards for Favorite Motion Picture Actress, and in 1990 was named World Favorite. Biographer Karen Hollinger described this period as a downturn in the popularity of Streep's films, attributing this partly to a critical perception that her comedies had been an attempt to convey a lighter image following several serious but commercially unsuccessful dramas, and more significantly to the lack of options available to an actress in her forties.[43] Streep commented that she had limited her options by her preference to work in Los Angeles, close to her family,[43] a situation that she had anticipated in a 1981 interview when she commented, "By the time an actress hits her mid-forties, no one's interested in her anymore. And if you want to fit a couple of babies into that schedule as well, you've got to pick your parts with great care."[36]
Streep played a drug-addicted movie actress in Postcards from the Edge, a screen adaptation of Carrie Fisher's novel of the same name, with Dennis Quaid and Shirley MacLaine. Streep and Goldie Hawn had established a friendship and were interested in making a film together. After considering various projects, they decided upon Thelma and Louise, until Streep's pregnancy coincided with the filming schedule, and the producers decided to proceed with Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis.[25] They subsequently filmed the farcical black comedy, Death Becomes Her, with Bruce Willis as their co-star. Time's Richard Corliss wrote approvingly of Streep's "wicked-witch routine" but dismissed the film as "She-Devil with a make-over".[44]
In 1995, Streep played opposite Clint Eastwood in the love story The Bridges of Madison County (1995).
Based on a best-selling novel by Robert James Waller,[45] it relates the story of Robert Kincaid (Eastwood), a photographer working for National Geographic, who has a love affair with a middle-aged Italian farm wife in Iowa named Francesca (Streep). Streep and Eastwood got along famously during production and such was their on-screen chemistry that a number of people believed that the two were having an affair off-camera, although this was denied by both.[46] The film was a hit at the box office and grossed $70 million in the United States.[47] The film, unlike the novel, surprised film critics and was warmly received. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that Clint had managed to create "a moving, elegiac love story at the heart of Mr. Waller's self-congratulatory overkill", while Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal described The Bridges of Madison County as "one of the most pleasurable films in recent memory".[47]
In 1996, Streep starred as Lee in Marvin's Room, an adaptation of the play by Scott McPherson. Diane Keaton played her estranged sister Bessie, a woman battling leukemia, although Streep had initially been considered for the role. The film also starred a young Leonardo DiCaprio as Streep's rebellious son. Roger Ebert stated that "Streep and Keaton, in their different styles, find ways to make Lee and Bessie into much more than the expression of their problems."[48] Although critically acclaimed, the film was not released on a wide scale. Streep, however, earned another Golden Globe nomination for the film.[49]
In 1999, Streep portrayed Roberta Guaspari, a real-life New Yorker who found passion and enlightenment teaching violin to inner-city kids in East Harlem, in the music drama Music of the Heart. A departure from director Wes Craven’s previous work on films like A Nightmare on Elm Street and the Scream series, Streep replaced singer Madonna who left the project before filming began due to creative differences with Craven. Required to perform on the violin, Streep went through two months of intense training, four to six hours a day.[50]
Streep entered the 2000s with Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence, a science fiction film about a childlike android, played by Haley Joel Osment, uniquely programmed with the ability to love, voicing the Blue Fairy.[51] The same year, Streep co-hosted the annual Nobel Peace Prize Concert concert with Liam Neeson which was held in Oslo, Norway on December 11, 2001 in honour of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, the United Nations and Kofi Annan.[52]
In 2002, Streep returned to the stage for the first time in more than twenty years, playing Arkadina in The Public Theater's revival of Anton Chekhov's The Seagull, directed by Mike Nichols and co-starring Kevin Kline, Natalie Portman, and Philip Seymour Hoffman.[53] The same year, she began work on Spike Jonze's comedy-drama Adaptation (2002), in which she portrayed real-life journalist Susan Orlean. Lauded by critics and viewers alike,[54] the film won Streep her fourth Golden Globe in the Best Supporting Actress category.[49] Also in 2002, Streep appeared alongside Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore in Stephen Daldry's The Hours, based on the 1999 novel by Michael Cunningham. Focusing on three women of different generations whose lives are interconnected by the novel Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf, the film was generally well received and won all three leading actresses a Silver Bear for Best Actress the following year.[49]
The following year, Streep had a cameo as herself in the Farrelly brothers comedy Stuck on You (2003) and reunited with Mike Nichols to star with Al Pacino and Emma Thompson in the HBO adaptation of Tony Kushner's six-hour play Angels in America, the story of two couples whose relationships dissolve amidst the backdrop of Reagan Era politics. Streep, who was cast in four roles in the mini-series, received her second Emmy Award and fifth Golden Globe for her performance.[49] In 2004, Streep was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award by the Board of Directors of the American Film Institute.[49] She appeared in Jonathan Demme's moderately successful remake of The Manchurian Candidate,[55] co-starring Denzel Washington, playing the role of a woman who is both a U.S. senator and the manipulative, ruthless mother of a vice-presidential candidate.[56] The same year, she played the supporting role of Aunt Josephine in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events alongside Jim Carrey, based on the first three novels in Snicket's book series. The black comedy received generally favorable reviews from critics,[57] and won the Academy Award for Best Makeup.[58] Inspired by her love of Giverny in France and Claude Monet, Streep did the narration for the film Monet's Palate, with Alice Waters, Steve Wynn, Daniel Boulud and Helen Rappel Bordman.[59][60]
Streep was next cast in the 2005 comedy Prime, directed by Ben Younger. In the film, she played Lisa Metzger, the Jewish psychoanalyst of a divorced and lonesome business-woman, played by Uma Thurman, who enters a relationship with Metzger's 23-year-old son (Bryan Greenberg). A modest mainstream success, it eventually grossed US$67.9 million internationally.[61] In August and September 2006, she starred onstage at The Public Theater's production of Mother Courage and Her Children at the Delacorte Theatre in Central Park.[62] The Public Theater production was a new translation by playwright Tony Kushner (Angels in America), with songs in the Weill/Brecht style written by composer Jeanine Tesori (Caroline, or Change); veteran director George C. Wolfe was at the helm. Streep starred alongside Kevin Kline and Austin Pendleton in this three-and-a-half-hour play in which she sang and appeared in almost every scene.
Also in 2006, Streep, along with Lily Tomlin, portrayed the last two members of what was once a popular family country music act in Robert Altman's final film A Prairie Home Companion. A comedic ensemble piece featuring Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Kline and Woody Harrelson, the film revolves around the behind-the-scenes activities at the long-running public radio show of the same name. The film grossed over US$26 million, the majority of which came from domestic markets.[63] Commercially, Streep fared better with a role in The Devil Wears Prada (2006), a loose screen adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's 2003 novel of the same name. Streep portrayed the powerful and demanding Miranda Priestly, fashion magazine editor (and boss of a recent college graduate played by Anne Hathaway), and her performance drew rave reviews from critics and earned her many award nominations, including her record-setting 14th Oscar bid, as well as another Golden Globe. Upon its commercial release, the film became Streep's biggest commercial success yet, grossing more than US$326.5 million worldwide.[64]

In 2007, Streep was cast in four films. She portrayed a wealthy university patron in Chen Shi-zheng's much-delayed feature drama Dark Matter (2007), a film about a Chinese science graduate student who becomes violent after dealing with academic politics at a U.S. university. Inspired by the events of the 1991 University of Iowa shooting,[65] and initially scheduled for a 2007 release, producers and investors decided to shelve Dark Matter out of respect for the Virginia Tech massacre in April 2007.[66] The drama received negative to mixed reviews upon its limited 2008 release.[67] Streep played a U.S. government official who investigates an Egyptian foreign national suspected of terrorism in the political thriller Rendition (2007), directed by Gavin Hood.[68] Keen to get involved in a thriller film, Streep welcomed the opportunity to star in a film genre for which she was not usually offered scripts and immediately signed on to the project.[69] Upon its release, Rendition was less commercially successful,[70] and received mixed reviews.[71]
Also in 2007, Streep had a short role alongside Vanessa Redgrave, Glenn Close and her eldest daughter Mamie Gummer in Lajos Koltai's drama film Evening, based on the 1998 novel of the same name by Susan Minot. Switching between the present and the past, it tells the story of a bedridden woman, who remembers her tumultuous life in the mid-1950s.[72] The film was released to lukewarm reactions by critics, who called it "beautifully filmed, but decidedly dull [and] a colossal waste of a talented cast."[73][74] Streep's last film of 2007 was Robert Redford's Lions for Lambs, a film about the connection between a platoon of United States soldiers in Afghanistan, a U.S. senator, a reporter, and a California college professor.
In 2008, Streep found major commercial success when she starred in Phyllida Lloyd's Mamma Mia!, a film adaptation of the musical of the same name, based on the songs of Swedish pop group ABBA. Co-starring Amanda Seyfried, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and Colin Firth, Streep played a single mother and a former girl-group singer, whose daughter (Seyfried), a bride-to-be who never met her father, invites three likely paternal candidates to her wedding on an idyllic Greek island.[75] An instant box office success, Mamma Mia! became Streep's highest-grossing film to date, with box office receipts of US$602.6 million,[76] also ranking it first among the highest-grossing musical films for now.[77] Nominated for another Golden Globe, Streep's performance was generally well received by critics, with Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe commenting "the greatest actor in American movies has finally become a movie star."[78]
Streep's other film of 2008 was Doubt featuring Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis. A drama revolving around the stern principal nun (Streep) of a Bronx Catholic school in 1964 who brings charges of pedophilia against a popular priest (Hoffman), the film became a moderate box office success,[79] but was hailed by many critics as one of the best of 2008.[80] The film received five Academy Awards nominations, for its four lead actors and for Shanley's script.[49]
In 2009, Streep played chef Julia Child in Nora Ephron's Julie & Julia, co-starring Amy Adams and Stanley Tucci. The first major motion picture based on a blog, it contrasts the life of Child in the early years of her culinary career with the life of young New Yorker Julie Powell (Adams), who aspires to cook all 524 recipes in Child's cookbook Mastering the Art of French Cooking in 365 days, a challenge she described on her popular blog, The Julie/Julia Project, that would make her a published author. The same year, Streep also starred in Nancy Meyers' romantic comedy It's Complicated, with Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin. She also received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for both of these films and won the award for the former.[81] Streep later received her 16th Oscar nomination for Julie & Julia.[82] She also lent her voice to Mrs. Felicity Fox in the stop-motion film Fantastic Mr. Fox.
Streep's first film of the 2010s was Phyllida Lloyd's The Iron Lady (2011), a British biographical film about Margaret Thatcher, which takes a look at the Prime Minister during the Falklands War and her years in retirement.[83] Streep, who sat through a session at the House of Commons to observe British MPs in action in preparation for her role,[84] called her cast "a daunting and exciting challenge."[85] While the film had a mixed reception, Streep's performance got rave reviews, earning her Best Actress awards at the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs as well as her third win at the 84th Academy Awards.[86][87][88] Former advisers, friends and family of Thatcher criticized Streep's portrayal of her as inaccurate and biased.[89] The following year, after Thatcher's death, Streep issued a formal statement criticizing Thatcher's "hard-nosed fiscal measures" and "hands-off approach to financial regulation," while praising her "personal strength and grit."[90]
In 2012, Streep reunited with Prada director David Frankel on the set of the comedy-drama film Hope Springs, co-starring Tommy Lee Jones and Steve Carell. In it, Streep and Jones play a middle-aged couple, who attend a week of intensive marriage counseling to try to bring back the intimacy missing in their relationship.[91] Reviews for the film were mostly positive, with critics praising the "mesmerizing performances from Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones" which offer "filmgoers some grown-up laughs -- and a thoughtful look at mature relationships". She earned her 27th Golden Globe nomination for her role, breaking her own record.[92]
At the National Board of Review Awards in 2013, Streep labeled Walt Disney (d. 1966) as "anti-semitic" and a "gender bigot."[93] Former actors, employees and animators who knew Disney during his lifetime rebuffed the comments as misinformed and selective.[94] The Walt Disney Family Museum issued a statement rebuking Streep's allegations indirectly, citing, among others, Disney's contributions to Jewish charities and his published letters stating that women "have the right to expect the same chances for advancement as men."[95] However, Disney's grandniece, Abigail Disney, wholeheartedly agreed with Streep's statements. Abigail Disney stated that he was an "anti-Semite," "misogynist," and "racist" who was also an exemplary filmmaker whose work "made billions of people happy." She admitted to having "mixed feelings" about her great-uncle but that her statements were about being "as honest as possible about those feelings, or else you are going to lead yourself into many a blind alley in life." [96]
In 2013, Streep starred along with supporting actress Julia Roberts in the film August: Osage County, which was filmed on-site in Oklahoma. The film is based on Tracy Letts's Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name and was directed by John Wells. Streep received Golden Globe, SAG, and Academy Award nominations for her role in this film.[97][98][99] In September 2012, it was reported that Streep along with Hilary Swank will join the production of The Homesman, Tommy Lee Jones' sophomore directorial effort.[100] In January 2013, numerous reports surfaced that Streep was cast as The Witch in a film adaptation of the Broadway musical Into the Woods.[101][102][103] Also in 2013, Streep joined the motion picture adaptation of The Giver with Jeff Bridges and The Good House along with Robert De Niro.[104][105] Streep agreed to play Emmeline Pankhurst, a supporting role in the film Suffragette, which started shooting during late February 2014.[106]
Streep is well known for her ability to imitate a wide range of accents,[24] from Danish in Out of Africa (1985) to English Received pronunciation in Plenty (also 1985), The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981) and The Iron Lady (2011); from Italian in The Bridges of Madison County (1995) to a Minnesota accent in A Prairie Home Companion (2006) and from Irish-American in Ironweed to a heavy Bronx accent in Doubt. After A Cry in the Dark (1988), critics were impressed with Streep's ability to master an Australian accent with shades of New Zealand English.[107] For her role in the film Sophie's Choice (1982), she spoke both English and German with a Polish accent, as well as Polish itself. In The Iron Lady, she reproduced the vocal style of Margaret Thatcher from the time before she became Britain's Prime Minister, and after she had taken elocution lessons to change her pitch, pronunciation and delivery.
Despite the accolades accorded to her, Streep has emphasized that adopting accents is an element she simply considers an obvious part of creating a character. When asked whether accents helped her get into character, she responded, "I'm always baffled by this question... How could I play that part and talk like me?" When questioned in Belfast as to how she reproduces different accents, Streep replied, "I listen" - in a dead-on Ulster accent.[108]
After Streep appeared in Mamma Mia!, her rendition of the song "Mamma Mia" rose to popularity in the Portuguese music charts, where it peaked at #8 in October 2008.[109]
At the 35th People's Choice Awards, her version of "Mamma Mia" won an award for "Favorite Song From A Soundtrack".[110] In 2008, Streep was nominated for a Grammy Award (her fifth nomination) for her work on the Mamma Mia! soundtrack.
In the questionnaire part of her Inside the Actor's Studio episode, she mentioned that if she was not an actress, she would have liked to be a musician.
Streep lived with actor John Cazale for three years until his death in March 1978.[111][112] Streep married sculptor Don Gummer on September 30, 1978.[113] They have four children: Henry Wolfe Gummer (b. 1979), Mamie Gummer (b. 1983), Grace Gummer (b. 1986), and Louisa Jacobson Gummer (b. 1991). Both Mamie and Grace are actresses, while Henry is a musician.[8][114]
When asked if religion plays a part in her life, in an interview in 2009, Streep replied, "I follow no doctrine. I don't belong to a church or a temple or a synagogue or an ashram."[115] In an interview in December 2008 she also alluded to her inability to follow a religion when she said "So I've always been really, deeply interested, because I think I can understand the solace that's available in the whole construct of religion. But I really don't believe in the power of prayer, or things would have been avoided that have happened, that are awful. So it's a horrible position as an intelligent, emotional, yearning human being to sit outside of the available comfort there. But I just can't go there." When asked from where she draws consolation in the face of aging and death, she responded, "Consolation? I'm not sure I have it. I have a belief, I guess, in the power of the aggregate human attempt – the best of ourselves. In love and hope and optimism – you know, the magic things that seem inexplicable. Why we are the way we are. I do have a sense of trying to make things better. Where does that come from?"[116]
Streep is the spokesperson for the National Women's History Museum, to which she has donated a significant amount of money (including her fee for The Iron Lady) and hosted numerous events.[117]
On October 4, 2012, Streep donated $1 million to The Public Theater in honor of both its late founder, Joseph Papp, and her friend, the author Nora Ephron.[118] She also supports Gucci's "Chime For Change" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment.[119]
In 2014, Streep established two scholarships for students at the University of Massachusetts Lowell - the Meryl Streep Endowed Scholarship for English majors, and the Janet Hertzberg Endowed Scholarship (named for Streep’s former classmate at Vassar College) for math majors. [120]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Considered by many critics to be the greatest living actress, Meryl Streep has been nominated for the Academy Award an astonishing 18 times, and has won it three times. Born Mary Louise Streep in 1949 in Summit, New Jersey, Meryl's early performing ambitions leaned toward the opera. She became interested in acting while a student at Vassar and upon graduation she enrolled in the Yale School of Drama. She gave an outstanding performance in her first film role, Julia (1977), and the next year she was nominated for her first Oscar for her role in The Deer Hunter (1978). She went on to win the Academy Award for her performances in Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) and Sophie's Choice (1982), in which she gave a heart-wrenching portrayal of an inmate mother in a Nazi death camp.A perfectionist in her craft and meticulous and painstaking in her preparation for her roles, Meryl turned out a string of highly acclaimed performances over the next decade in great films like Silkwood (1983); Out of Africa (1985); Ironweed (1987); and Evil Angels (1988). Her career declined slightly in the early 1990s as a result of her inability to find suitable parts, but she shot back to the top in 1995 with her performance as Clint Eastwood's married lover in The Bridges of Madison County (1995) and as the prodigal daughter in Marvin's Room (1996). In 1998 she made her first venture into the area of producing, and was the executive producer for the moving ...First Do No Harm (1997). A realist when she talks about her future years in film, she remarked that "...no matter what happens, my work will stand..."

      Early in her career, Streep received a letter from Bette Davis, whom most critics and cinema historians ranks as the greatest American movie actress ever. Davis told Streep that she felt that she was her successor as the premier American actress. Davis, a double winner who was nominated 10 times for an Academy Award, all of them Best Actress nods, set the record for most acting nominations with her tenth in 1963 for What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

      Was nominated for Best Actress in 1987 along with Cher. When Cher was announced, just before the cameras cut away from the other four actresses, Streep could be seen springing to her feet in delight and applauding for Cher.

As the camera briefly cut away to Streep sitting in the audience, she blew Cher a kiss.

      In 2013, she presented the Best Actor Oscar to Daniel Day-Lewis for Lincoln (2012). The previous year, she had received her third Best Actress Oscar for The Iron Lady (2011), and she give Lewis his third Best Actor Oscar. Both won their third Oscar for playing a Head of Government of a different nationality: Streep was an American actress playing a British Prime Minister, while Day-Lewis is a British actor playing an American President. In addition, Day-Lewis was not the only actor playing Abraham Lincoln that year. The part was played in Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012) by Benjamin Walker, who was married to Streep's daughter Mamie Gummer.
      Was a finalist for the role of Ellen Ripley in Alien (1979), but the part went to good friend and classmate Sigourney Weaver instead. However, Streep later got to make her own contribution to the character. Many of the special effects for Alien³ (1992) were created in England, after the cast; including Weaver; had returned home to the U.S. The filmmakers needed a prosthetic cast of Ripley's head for some shots, so rather than call back Weaver, they used an available cast of Streep that had been made for a previous project and was still floating around the studio.
      Her father was of German and Swiss-German descent, and his patrilineal ancestors had originally been surnamed "Streeb". Her mother had English, German, and Irish ancestry, and was descended from early settlers in Pennsylvania. One of Meryl's maternal great-grandmothers, Mary Agnes McFadden, was born in Ireland.

      Is one of 6 actresses to have been pregnant at the time of winning the Academy Award; the others are Eva Marie Saint, Patricia Neal, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Rachel Weisz and Natalie Portman. Neal is the only to have not accepted her award in person as a result of her pregnancy. Streep was 5 months pregnant with her daughter Mamie Gummer when she won the Best Actress Oscar for Sophie's Choice (1982).
      Was the 82nd actress to receive an Academy Award; she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) at The 52nd Annual Academy Awards (1980) on April 14, 1980.
      In 2013, David Letterman revealed that the director Harmony Korine had been banned from appearing on Letterman's show during the late 1990s when Letterman personally caught Korine rifling through Meryl Streep's purse in a dressing room. Streep and Korine had both been scheduled to appear on Letterman's show that night, but only Streep did.
      [in 1978] I'm looking forward to bigger parts in the future, but I'm not doing soft-core scripts where the character emerges in half-light, half-dressed.
      I don't want to spit in the eye of good fortune, but it was weird. I felt like I'd butted in line in front of Lucille Ball, Audrey Hepburn, Katharine Hepburn. Hello? How did this happen? I was only the sixth woman to receive it, but they found 26 men to give it to. I thought that was embarrassing. [on her Lifetime Achievement Award from the AFI]
      I thought it was really fun, you've got to understand, but I didn't think it was a serious way to conduct your life. You know, I had a sense of mission. I was a true child of the '60s. [on her view of acting back in college]
      I love doing comedy, but people just don't give me enough of a chance. It's one of the reasons I enjoy The Manchurian Candidate (2004) so much. It's because I actually get a chance to be funny.
      Let's face it, we were all once 3-year-olds who stood in the middle of the living room and everybody thought we were so adorable. Only some of us grow up and get paid for it.
      [accepting an Emmy for Angels in America (2003)] You know, there are some days when I myself think I'm overrated, but not today.
      Someone once said that sometimes studio heads don't want to cast films with the image of their first wife in the role. It's just rather unpleasant for them. So they like the idea of the new one.
      I loved being someone so certain. Because certainty is just so attractive in people. To me, it's a completely bogus position - for me. Because, you know, I'm listening to every side. But it's so nice not to have to listen to all the different sides. To be so clear and on your track and sure. It's a fabulous thing. Unfortunately, it leads to fanaticism. [on her role in The Manchurian Candidate (2004)]
      I think I was wired for family. You know how they say people are wired for religion, or wired for this or that? I always knew I would like to, if I could find the right person, have a family. I can't imagine living single.
      I get nervous calling myself an artist. I feel I'm more like an interpreter or a violinist, you know.
      [on winning the 1983 Best Actress Oscar for Sophie's Choice (1982)] Oh boy, no matter how much you try to imagine what this is like, it's just so incredibly thrilling right down your toes.
      But ... in my own experience of male and female directors, people have a much, much harder time taking a direct command from a woman. It's somehow very difficult for people.
      I mean, come on; when you have people writing these things, that you're the greatest thing that ever ate scenery, you're dead. You're fucking dead. How can you even presume to begin a new character? It's a killer.
      It's a lesson I learned in drama school: the teacher asks, how do you be the queen? And everybody says, 'Oh it's about posture and authority.' And they said, no, it's about how the air in the room shifts when you walk in. And that's everyone else's work.
      I really, really depend on the other actors for the confirmation of who I think I am," she says. "And so it's important to me to work with good people that are not worried about how they look. You know. Real actors. They're your blood.
      [part of Emmy acceptance speech for Angels in America (2003)] Glenn Close is my friend so I know she'll forgive me, Helen Mirren is an acting god, and no one has put a better performance on film than Judy Davis in Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows (2001). The only one in the group is Emma Thompson, who will hold a grudge for the rest of her life. But who cares?
      [accepting the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical 2007] "I think I've worked with everyone in the room! I have!"
      It's hard to negotiate the present landscape with a brain and a female body. (On her struggles as an actress earlier in her career)
      My God, I was settling in for a long winter's nap. I've been nominated, like 789 times, but it hasn't been since the Mesozoic Era that I've actually won. (On winning a Golden Globe for Adaptation. (2002)).
      It would be nice to have a woman President. I think half the Senate should be women, half of Parliament, half the ruling mullahs. But that will never happen, darling!
      [on Dustin Hoffman] He's energized and the greatest combination of the generous and the selfish that ever lived. He wants to be the greatest actor who ever was.
      I don't know what I'd do without my husband. I'd be dead, emotionally at least, if I hadn't met him. He's the greatest. - On her husband.
      Listening is everything. Listening is the whole deal. That's what I think. And I mean that in terms of before you work, after you work, in between work, with your children, with your husband, with your friends, with your mother, with your father. It's everything. And it's where you learn everything.
      There's no road map on how to raise a family: it's always an enormous negotiation. But I have a holistic need to work and to have huge ties of love in my life. I can't imagine eschewing one for the other. - on her marriage.
      [on life as a young actress] When I was 20 I busked to afford accommodation. One night I hadn't earned enough, I actually slept in the open in Green Park [in London]. The view was of the Ritz Hotel and I vowed I'd stay there one day. And I have.
      I hate the [Oscar] campaigning thing. It's unseemly. You should be honored for something. It shouldn't be for whose campaign was better.
      My daughters had helped me to stop worrying about my appearance over the years. I wasted so many years thinking I wasn't pretty enough and why didn't I have Jessica Lange's body or someone else's legs? What a waste of time. (February 2009 about her appearance.)
      I've been nominated for an Oscar 15 times and won twice, but it still feels like it's happening to someone else. I wish I could feel it more. (2009)
      Tash was the warm sun in the center of a large constellation of family, friends, all of those lucky enough to know her - she is irreplaceable in our lives; she gave us so much, so generously - her legacy is the love that connects us all. (on Natasha Richardson's tragic death.)
      My greatest culinary triumph was when I was falling in love with my husband. We were on the coast of Maine in a cabin and I made an apple pie...just whipped it up, without a recipe or anything..just the perfect pastry. I've never been able to do it again - and he asks for it often!
      Turning 60 was important to everyone else. It was a big number, to me it was, 'Well yeah, that comes after 59', and I don't even want to look it in the eye.
      The prospect of exploring the swathe cut through history by this remarkable woman is a daunting and exciting challenge. I am trying to approach the role with as much zeal, fervor and attention to detail as the real Lady Thatcher possesses - I can only hope my stamina will begin to approach her own. (On portraying Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady (2011))
      [1994, on if she's bothered when one of her films don't do well at the box-office] I'm horribly disappointed when people don't see what I consider some of my best work. Yeah, I'm very sad. But I know that I have a video life. Most of my fans are home with their children waiting for my films to come out on video. But I'm disappointed because certain things should be seen on the big screen. I was very proud of Evil Angels (1988), but it wasn't distributed widely enough for people to have seen it on the big screen.
      [1994, on career choices] What affects your career choices are the three interesting scripts you get in a year, two of which you're wrong for, one you think you might want to do if you're real lucky. You can't possibly plot what's going to be available, what's going to be written, who's going to think of it, and if it will come to you or not.
      [2008] One of the most important keys to acting is curiosity. I am curious to the point of being nosy. What that means is you want to devour lives. You're eager to put on their shoes and wear their clothes and have them become a part of you. All people contain mystery, and when you act, you want to plumb that mystery until everything is known to you.
      [on The Iron Lady (2011)] It was one of those rare, rare films where I was grateful to be an actor and grateful for the privilege of being able to look at a life deeply with empathy.
      It took a lot out of me, but it was a privilege to play her (Margaret Thatcher), it really was. I still don't agree with a lot of her policies. But I feel she believed in them and that they came from an honest conviction, and that she wasn't a cosmetic politician just changing make-up to suit the times.
      [on Margaret Thatcher] We on the Left didn't like her policies but secretly we were thrilled that a woman had made it, and we thought, "Wow, if it can happen there in England, it could happen here." But we're still waiting in America.
      She's still an incredibly divisive figure, but you miss her clarity today. It was all very clear and up front, and I loved that eagerness to mix it up and to make it about ideas. Today it's all about feelings. You know, "How do I come off?" and, "Does this seem OK?" You want people who are willing to find a solution. I admire the fact that she was a "love-me-or-hate-me" kind of leader who said: "This is what I stand for." It's a hard thing to do and no one's doing that now. (On Margaret Thatcher)
      [on what appealed to her about playing Margaret Thatcher] Women and power, and diminishment of power, and loss of power. And reconciliation with your life where you come to a point where you've lived most of it, and it's behind you. I have always liked and been intrigued by older people and the idea that behind them lives every human trauma, drama, glory, jokes, love.
      I consider all the roles I play a privilege but this one was special because there are such vehement opinions about her. People seemed to look at her as an icon or a monster and I just wanted to locate the human being inside those caricatures that we've seen over so many years. And to investigate myself what it must have been like for her. (On Margaret Thatcher)
      ponding to those who have criticized the emphasis placed on Margaret Thatcher's frail and confused old age] Some people have said it's shameful to portray this part of a life. But the corollary of that is that, if you think that debility, delicacy, dementia are shameful, if you think that the ebbing of a life is something that should be shut away, if you think that people need to be defended from these images then - yes - then you'll think it's a shameful thing.
      I was never engaged to John Cazale. We lived together for three years until he died of bone cancer.
      [on avoiding cosmetic surgery] I really understand the chagrin that accompanies aging, especially for a woman, but I think people look funny when they freeze their faces. In Los Angeles there's a lot of that. I pick up on the part that doesn't move on a face. I'm immediately drawn to it and that is the opposite of what you're intending. You pull focus on the area that's been worked on.
=======================================================
This renowned actress was born Mary Louise Streep to father, Harry Streep Jr., a pharmaceutical executive, and mother, Mary, a commercial artist. Harry loved to play the piano and Mary loved to sing, so Streep and her two younger brothers grew up surrounded by music.

At the age of 22, Streep made her professional stage debut in ‘The Playboy of Seville’ (1971) and her Broadway debut was in ‘Trelawney of the Wells’ (1975). She was involved with the theatre from 1975 to 1981, when her film career really began to flourish. She received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Play for her role in the Broadway production of Tennessee William’s’ ’27 Wagons Full of Cotton’ (1976). She also received Drama Desk Award nominations for her roles in ‘The Cherry Orchard’ (1976) and ‘Happy End’ (1977).
Her small screen debut was in the made-for-television movie ‘The Deadliest Season’ (1977) and her big screen debut in ‘Julia’ (1977), in which she gave an excellent performance in a small part in a flashback sequence. The following year, on 15 September 1978, she married sculptor Don Gummer. The couple have four children, Henry (b. 1979), Mary (aka Mamie) (b. 1983), Grace (b. 1986) and Louisa (b. 1991).
Wasting no time in achieving accolades, Streep was nominated for her first Oscar for her second feature film role in ‘The Deer Hunter’ (1978), one of the most powerful films of all time. She won her first Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or TV Movie, for her role in ‘Holocaust’ (1978). She then won two Academy Awards, the first for Best Supporting Actress for her role in ‘Kramer vs. Kramer’ (1979), opposite Dustin Hoffman and the second for Best Actress as Sophie Zawistowski in ‘Sophie’s Choice’ (1982).
She went on to make highly acclaimed performances in several films throughout the remainder of the 1980s. These include her first starring role in a feature film, ‘The French Lieutenant’s Woman’ (1981) with Jeremy Irons; ‘Silkwood’ (1983) with Kurt Russell and Cher; ‘Out of Africa’ (1985) co-starring Robert Redford; ‘Heartburn’ (1986) and ‘Ironweed’ (1987), both with Jack Nicholson; and as Lindy Chamberlain, with Sam Neill in ‘Evil Angels’ (1988), the fact-based film drama, known in America as ‘A Cry in the Dark’, for which she won the 1989 Cannes Film Festival Best Actress Award. She won six People’s Choice Awards for Favourite Motion Picture Actress between 1984 and 1990, the year she was named World Favourite.
Some people viewed Streep’s career as having declined slightly in the early 1990s, due to the lack of suitable parts. There was ‘Postcards from the Edge’ (1990), with Shirley MacLaine and Dennis Quaid, and the farcical black comedy ‘Death Becomes Her’ (1992), with Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis. The romantic drama ‘The House of Spirits’ (1993) had an all-star cast including Glenn Close, Jeremy Irons, Winona Rider, Antonio Banderas and Vanessa Redgrave and was set in pre-World War II South America. Streep was back on top form with ‘The Bridges of Madison County’ (1995), for which she received an Academy Award nomination, and ‘Marvin’s Room’ (1996) with Leonardo DiCaprio, Diane Keaton and Robert De Niro.
Streep returned to television work, as executive producer of ‘…First Do No Harm’ (1997), a fact-based story in which she also starred. On 16 September 1998, she was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. ‘Music of the Heart’ (1999) was a role that required her to learn to play the violin, which she did by practicing six hours a day for eight weeks.
Returning to the stage in July 2001, for the first time in more than 20 years, she played Arkadina in Anton Chekov’s ‘The Seagull’. It was a New York production that also featured Natalie Portman, Kevin Kline, Chrisopher Walken, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Marcia Gay Harden and John Goodman. Five years later, she played the title role in ‘Mother Courage and Her Children’.
She provided the voice of the Blue Mecha in Steven Spielberg’s ‘Artificial Intelligence: AI’ (2001) before playing real-life author Susan Orlean, with Nicholas Cage, in the quirky ‘Adaptation’ (2002). Next was ‘The Hours’ (2002) with Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore, for which Streep received a BAFTA nomination for her leading role performance. She won her second Emmy Award for outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie, as well as a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actress in a Miniseries or a Motion Picture Made for Television, for the television mini series ‘Angels in America’ (2003), in which she played multiple roles opposite Al Pacino, Emma Thompson and Mary-Louise Parker.
‘The Manchurian Candidate’ (2004) found Streep playing a more comical role than her usual intense performances and was a film she really enjoyed making for that reason. ‘Prime’ (2005), a romantic comedy with Uma Thurman and Bryan Greenberg, cast Streep in the role of psychoanalyst Lisa Metzger, whose client falls in love with her son. She played the inimitable magazine editor, Miranda Priestly, in ‘The Devil Wears Prada’ (2006), for which she earned SAG and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress.
She was cast as country music singer Yolanda Johnson in Robert Altman’s ‘A Prairie Home Companion’ (2006) and went on to star in a number of movies in 2007, including ‘Dark Matter’, ‘Evening’, ‘Rendition’ and ‘Lions for Lambs’. The latter saw her team up with Tom Cruise and Robert Redford, who directed the feature about US politics and the wars in the Middle East.
Streep then took on the role of Donna Sheridan in the film version of the West End musical ‘Mamma Mia!’, which is based on the songs of ABBA. Co-starring Amanda Seyfried, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard and Julie Walters, the movie earned her critical acclaim and led to Golden Globe and Satellite Award nominations. It also became the highest-grossing musical film of all time.
Following the success of the musical, Streep went on to attract even more praise for her role as Sister Aloysius Beauvier in Scott Rudin’s ‘Doubt’, which landed her an Academy Award for Best Actress nomination. She won several other major accolades for the film, which paved the way for even greater critical triumph with her next project.
‘Julie & Julia’ (2009) not only earned her another Academy Award nomination, but helped her collect more than a dozen other gongs, including a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. Next came a voice role in ‘Fantastic Mr. Fox’ and an appearance in ‘It’s Complicated’, both of which led to more recognition. Streep’s versatility also led to her landing the role of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher in ‘The Iron Lady’ (2011).
Having worked extensively in theatre, television and film for over three decades, Streep is considered by many as one of the most respected and talented actresses of her generation. She certainly is a perfectionist when it comes to her work, preparing meticulously for a new role and is known for her ability to master different accents. She has a way of immersing herself so completely into her character that shows an intensity and love for acting. With many projects underway and due for release in the next few years, Streep is showing no signs of slowing down. We are certain to be blessed with many more performances injected with the magic of Streep.

Born Mary Louise Streep on June 22, 1949 in Summit, New Jersey, to pharmaceutical company executive Harry Streep and 
commercial artist Mary Streep. Meryl describes herself at age seven as already looking like a forty year old and acting 
like one too! The kids thought I was one of their teachers. Her devoted parents were able to move to Basking Ridge and 
then Bernardsville, a wealthier nearby community in central New Jersey. Teaching their children arts and literature from 
an early age on , Meryl was raised with two younger brothers, Harry III (whom she nicknamed Third because of the Roman 
Meryl in high school and as Homecoming queen. Meryl (far right) and classmates in a production of Lil Abner.
Meryl remembers herself as a child with unflinching honesty: I was an ugly little kid with a big mouth, an obnoxious 
show-off. Even so, she got her first applause by age twelve when she sang O Holy Night in French in her schools 
Christmas concert. She was so good, in fact, that she stunned her family and classmates and others urged her parents to 
get her singing lessons which she took with internationally renowned coach Estelle Liebling. It was Meryls first 
encounter with a true artist. Once a week for several years, Meryl was driven to Lieblings Upper East Side residence to 
take her lessons. The woman who trained the hour before Meryl was Beverly Sills, an admired opera singer in the sixties 
and seventies. Eventually, Meryl quit her lessons when she became far more interested in boys and in being a cheerleader. 
Cheerleading turned out to be Meryl Streeps first role. At age fourteen she took off her corrective lenses, refused to 
wear dental braces and dyed her hair blonde. This was my make-over During footballs off-seasons, Meryl sang in the 
chorus, worked on the school newspaper and yearbook and eventually became the homecoming queen of her graduation year. 
Recalling this period of her life, Meryl says I was a nice girl, pretty, athletic, and Id read maybe seven books in 
four years of high school had a great vocabulary, and no understanding whatsoever of mathematics or science. But I had a 
way of imitating peoples speech that got me an advance placement in French without really knowing any grammar. I was not 
what you would call a natural scholar. Between honors in French and English Lit, the swim team, the cheerleading practice 
and the drama club, she arrived at school each day a Seventeen Magazine knockout , as she herself recalls with sardonic 
In high school Streep recounted having only two friends and one was my cousin, she says so that didnt count. Then 
theres that whole awful kind of competition based on pubescent rivalry for boys. She began acting in plays at her highschool 
in Bernardsville, including the lead performances in Lil Abner and Oklahoma, before she began studying at the all 
female Vassar College. Although it was her second choice as a college, Vassar changed her life. On entering, she says, 
if you had asked me what feminism was. I wouldve thought it had something to do with having nice nails and clean hair. 
I felt absolutely great in that atmosphere. Suddenly, I felt accepted by the entire other half of the human race. Although 
Streep entered Vassar as a music major, she soon realized that her passion was the stage. From the time I entered college, 
I never felt the need to compete with anyone. At Vassar, it was commonplace to give your best shot, so that became a 
habit. I learned to believe in myself and aquired a genuine sense of identity. In 1969, she played the title role of 
August Strindbergs Miss Julie, a one act in which aristocratic Julie has a brief affair with Jean, her fathers valet.

From All Movie Guide: Sydney Pollack -- one of Meryl Streep's collaborators time and again -- once proclaimed her the most gifted film actress of the late 20th century. Most insiders would concur with this assessment. To avid moviegoers, she represents the essence of onscreen dramatic art. Like Hoffman (and De Niro), she demonstrates a transcendent ability to plunge into her characters and lose herself inside of them, transforming herself physically to meet the demands of her roles. A luminous blonde with nearly translucent pale skin, intelligent blue eyes, and an elegant facial bone structure, Streep sustains a fragile, fleeting beauty that allows her to travel the spectrum between earthily plain (Ironweed), and ethereally glamorous and radiant (Manhattan, Heartburn).Born June 22, 1949, in Summit, NJ, Streep took operatic voice lessons, and subsequently cultivated a fascination with acting while she attended Bernards High School. Upon graduation, Streep studied drama at Vassar, Dartmouth, and Yale, where she appeared in 30 to 40 productions with the Yale Repertory Theater. With a five-star education and years of collegiate stage work under her belt, Streep headed for the New York footlights and launched her off-Broadway career. Streep's performance in Tennessee Williams' {+27 Wagons Full of Cotton}, for which she received a Tony nomination, constitutes a particularly strong theatrical highlight from this period. She made her television debut in Robert Markowitz's The Deadliest Season (1977). That year she also appeared onscreen for the first time in Fred Zinnmann's Julia (1977) as Anna Marie, opposite heavyweights Jane Fonda,  Vanessa Redgrave, and Hal Holbrook. The following year, Streep picked up an Emmy for her performance in Marvin J. Chomsky's miniseries Holocaust. She first teamed with De Niro in Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter (1978).Around this time, Streep became involved with the diminutive performer John Cazale, whom she met on the set of the Cimino film. Tragically, this marriage was ill-fated from day one, Cazale's frail body ridden with bone cancer. Forty-two at the time, he passed away in March 1978, nine months prior to the premiere of The Deer Hunter. Streep later wed Don Gummer, who was not associated with Hollywood in any capacity.Streep next appeared as Woody Allen's ruthless lesbian ex-wife in his elegiac comedy drama Manhattan (1979) and Alan Alda's Southern mistress in the scathing political satire The Seduction of Joe Tynan. Her shattering interpretation of the scarred and torn Joanna Kramer opposite Dustin Hoffman in Robert Benton's heartbreaking divorce saga Kramer vs. Kramer (1979), earned her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 1980 -- which she famously left on top of a toilet at the festivities -- alongside a plethora of L.A. Film Critics Association, New York Film Critics Circle, and Golden Globe Awards for the Allen, Benton, and Alda films.Streep continued her ascent over the next decade by establishing herself as Hollywood's top box-office draw and a critical darling. Her double performance in the innovative Karel Reisz/Harold Pinter triumph The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981), her gut-wrenching interpretation of the titular Holocaust survivor in Alan J. Pakula's haunting adaptation Sophie's Choice (1982), and her thoughtful evocation of Karen Silkwood in Mike Nichols' drama Silkwood were highlights of the period. In the latter, she portrays a real-life victimized nuclear-plant worker who mysteriously disappears just prior to turning in crucial evidence against her employers.Streep's decision to headline Sydney Pollack's lush epic Out of Africa (1985), as Karen Blixen, sustained her reputation. She would go on over the next decade to appear in projects like but Ironweed, Heartburn, She-Devil, Postcards from the Edge, and Death Becomes Her. In 1994, she again surprised her fans when she appeared as a muscular expert whitewater rafter who must fight a raging river and two dangerous fugitives to save her family in the action thriller River Wild (1994). In interviews, she said she did the film because she wanted to have an adventure like Harrison Ford and to overcome a few of her own fears.Streep returned to the depth and multifacetedness of her early roles -- with much concomitant success -- when she took a more low-key role as a dowdy, Earthbound farm wife who finds Illicit love with an itinerant photographer (Clint Eastwood) in The Bridges of Madison County. Following the critical and commercial heights of Bridges, Streep picked up yet another Oscar nomination for her performance as a terminally ill wife and mother in Carl Franklin's One True Thing (1998).Streep then signed on to replace Madonna as the lead in 1999's Music of the Heart, tackling what outwardly appeared to be a cookbook Hollywood plot (a teacher on a mission to teach violin to a class of inner-city youth in Harlem) with absolute commitment, teaching herself to play the violin by practicing six hours a day for eight weeks. In the new millennium, Streep hit audiences with the back-to-back with lauded performances in Adaptation and The Hours, earning an Oscar nomination for the former and a Golden Globe nomination for the latter.On the heels of this success, Streep won an Emmy in 2004 for her participation in longtime friend and collaborator Mike Nichols' Angels in America mini-series. She soon afterward won even greater audience and critic approval for her biting role as a corporate and political conspirator in Jonathan Demme's remake of the 1962 thriller The Manchurian Candidate. Streepfollowed this up with a part in the lighthearted comedies Prime, A Prairie Home Companion, and The Devil Wears Prada.In 2007 Streep starred in a pair of timely dramas about the Iraq War, Lions for Lambs and Rendition, before returning to the musical comedy milieu with 2008's Mamma Mia!. The adaptation of the smash stage musical shattered box-office records, becoming the highest grossing film in the history of the United Kingdom, and the biggest American hit of her illustrious career. She followed that up with the lead role in John Patrick Shanley's adaptation of his award-winning play Doubt, a performance that earned her fifteenth acting nomination from the Academy, as well as nods from the Screen Actors Guild, and the Hollywood Foreign Press.The renowned actress was nominated yet again for the Academy Award and the Screen Actors Guild the following year for her turn as Julia Child in the comedy Julie & Julia, a role that also garnered her a win for Best Actress from the New York Film Critics as well as the Golden Globes. That same year she played the lead for Nancy Myers in the box office hit It's Complicated, only to dive directly back into the Oscar spotlight again the next year with her acclaimed performance as English Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 2012's The Iron Lady. The role garnered Streep her 17th Academy Award nomination -- resulting in her third win, this time for Best Actress, in addition to Best Actress wins from the New York Film Critics Circle and the Golden Globes. ~ Sandra Brennan, Rovi
