Bryan Matthew Sevilla (born February 7, 1986), better known by his stage name James Deen, in reference to the popular actor James Dean, is an American pornographic actor and director.[4][5][6] He entered the porn industry in 2004 at the age of 18. He has gained attention due to his lack of resemblance to stereotypical male actors in the pornography industry.[3]
James Deen was born Bryan Matthew Sevilla in Los Angeles County, California, and raised in Pasadena, California.[7][8][9][10][11] His father is a mechanical engineer and his mother is a computer electronic engineer;[12] one of them worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.[13] He is Jewish and identifies with Judaism as "a culture more than anything else".[14][15][16] At 17, Deen moved in with his father. He worked at a Starbucks for two years and took classes at Pasadena City College.[12][17]
According to Deen, performing in pornographic films was his ambition since he was in kindergarten.[18] After entering the pornography industry in 2004, he initially worked with older female performers.[3] In 2009, Deen was named the "Male Performer of the Year" by Adult Video News at the age of 22, making him the youngest actor to have won this award.[3] Deen has a fan-following among teenage girls, a demographic that is typically not associated with the pornographic industry.[3] In February 2012, ABC Nightline aired the feature "Porn's Boy Next Door", which included interviews with both Deen and his fans. One fan described him as the Ryan Gosling of porn.[19]
ln September 2012, Deen was a participant in a press conference, along with others opposing Los Angeles County Measure B, an initiative which would require condom usage in the pornographic film industry.[20] Deen questioned the measure's constitutionality.
Deen’s collaborations include work with popular NSFW site WoodRocket.com. As the host of original web series, “James Deen Loves Food”, Deen has been featured reviewing top restaurants, to ordering every item on a drive-thru menu at once, and creating a $580 burrito.[21]
In January 2013, Deen took to crowdfunding site Kickstarter.com to raise funds for the mainstream steampunk Western film Cowboys And Engines.[22][23] Deen is listed as the producer of the Bryn Pryor vehicle. The campaign surpassed its goal of $100,000 in 58 days.[24] Actors Malcolm McDowell, Richard Hatch, and Walter Koenig have signed on to the project.[25] In February 2013, Deen was invited to return to his alma mater, Pasadena City College, to speak to students about his career. The appearance, initially open to the public, was restricted by college administrators due to “public safety concerns” over “protesters”.[26] Deen was restricted to speaking to the students of PCC’s “Navigating Pornography” class.[27] Deen participated in a “Night With The Stars: Life, Love, and Sex in the Workplace” panel as part of “Sex Week”, held at Washington University in St Louis, MO.[28]
Deen has been invited to college and university campuses across the country to speak with students on legislation, condom use and contraception, relationships, media, and sexuality.[29] Deen also spoke to students at the University of Wisconsin – Madison on April 18, dubbed “A Night with James Deen: Pornography & Sex Ed”, as the keynote for the university’s Sexual Health Fest.[30]
Deen was featured in a July 2012 GQ multi-page article, chronicling his work and personal life.[31] GQ interviewed Deen again for an article about his workout regimen, in which he credited healthy eating habits, a “Jew stomach”,[clarification needed] and lots of sex.[32]
In 2013, Deen was listed as the only male performer to make the CNBC "Dirty Dozen" list of the porn industry's popular stars.[33]
In April 2013, information was leaked about Deen’s involvement in the mainstream Samuel Gonzalez, Jr. movie, based on events surrounding D.B. Cooper and the novel Catcher In The Rye.[34] Deen said, “I am not going anywhere” in response to questions about his intention to leave porn.[35]
In April 2013, Deen filmed a pornographic scene with reality television participant Farrah Abraham, who had been in one of the Teen Mom series. Deen indicated that he was asked to pretend to be dating Abraham as part of a ploy to market the scene as an accidentally released sex tape, but refused to do so, arguing, "If you're going to make a celebrity sex tape and try to pass it off as an amateur home video, you don't hire a well-known porn star!"[36] In 2014 they filmed a sequel.[37]
Deen co-starred with Lindsay Lohan in Paul Schrader's 2013 film The Canyons, written by Bret Easton Ellis.[8][38]
In July 2013, Deen teamed with American pornographic actress Andy San Dimas, adult app store MiKandi, and adult industry news source XBIZ, to release the first adult video production recorded with Google Glass. Within 24 hours, the censored trailer reached 1 million views on YouTube.[39] The uncensored adult video can be found for free on MiKandi's website.
Deen filmed a scene with Huffington Post blogger and comedienne Jenn Tisdale in late 2013, in a New York City hotel room, after she responded to an open invitation by Deen on Twitter.[40]
In an interview with the Huffington Post, porn actress Stoya stated that she was dating James Deen.[41]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          At the age of 12, James was first called "James Deen" due to the way he smoked. As a teenager he listened to an interview with Jenna Jameson on the nationally syndicated radio program, "Loveline." When a male caller asked Jenna how he could become a porn star. she responded that he needed to be able to masturbate in a room full of 20 of his best friends. Taking this advice to heart, James began having sex at parties and Raves. He credits this exhibitionist behavior with helping him perform in front of the camera. At the age of 17, James was attending a community college in Pasadena. While there, he decided to break into the adult film industry by meeting girls who had connections to the porn industry. Through these connections, James was introduced to Pamela Peaks who helped him choose his old nickname as his stage name (other options included Clint Cullingus). Deen was represented at that time by World Modeling. However, it was difficult for him to find work due to only being 18 and having no on-screen experience. Deen's first big break came in 2004 when Eon McKai cast him in Art School Sluts (2004). During the first year of his adult film career, James Deen worked on nearly 500 scenes.
      James's paternal grandfather, Stanley Sevilla, was born in Ohio, to Dienna and Isadore Sevilla, who were Sephardi Jewish immigrants from Istanbul, Turkey. James's paternal grandmother, Lois Howell, had English, Scottish, and German ancestry. Lois was also born in Ohio, to Thomas William Howell and Ruth Mary Hirst. Lois's own mother (James's great-grandmother) was born in South Africa, to American parents. James's mother's family is Ashkenazi Jewish.
      Having sex with beautiful women for money? My God. I want to shoot myself every night when I get home. Honestly? I've said repeatedly to people that I know, if I ever make a single complaint about this business that they should just beat my ass on sight, pretty much. I cannot imagine something I'd rather do than this. Like in the entire world. (On being a porn star)
=======================================================
                        When we talk, the first words out of James Deen’s mouth are, “I’d like to preemptively apologize for being in a little bit of chaos. I was just at work, and I’m a bit frazzled and frantic.” He sounds more like a mild-mannered accountant than a world-famous porn star whose Twitter bio proudly states, “I bang chicks for a living.”James Deen isn’t your garden-variety male porn star, though. There’s nothing threatening or creepy about him. He has a goofy cooking show called James Deen Loves Food. He has legions of teen girl fans (it’s doubtful Ron Jeremy could ever list that factoid on his resume). Deen -- real name Bryan Matthew Sevilla -- grew up upper middle class in California, the son of two NASA engineers. People think of him as a boy next door, even though his day job isn’t exactly G-rated. Actually, it’s not even rated NC-17. Still, he’s managed to bridge the gap between adult films and mainstream success. His first so-called Hollywood film, The Canyons, has gotten a lot of ink, mainly due to the supposed chaos on set. Written by Bret Easton Ellis, directed by Paul Schrader (who wrote Taxi Driver and American Gigolo) and costarring Lindsay Lohan, it’s a low-budget, softcore flick about a sadistic trust fund kid named Christian who spirals out of control when he becomes suspicious that his girlfriend Tara is cheating. Deen plays Christian, Lohan plays the girlfriend Tara, and they shot it on a shoestring budget. For a small movie, the personalities involved have drummed up a lot of anticipation. We talked to Deen about The Canyons, shooting porn vs. shooting a more mainstream movie and whether he really feels like the “porn star next door.” Watch The Canyons Trailer: 
The image a lot of people have of you is kind of a happy-go-lucky porn star, and Christian, the character you play in The Canyons, is pretty much the polar opposite of that. He’s a murderous sociopath. Is that difference what drew you to the role?
                    I really loved the idea of playing the classic Bret Easton Ellis high-functioning sociopath. He’s not a good guy, but at the same time you’re kind of rooting for him, like Patrick Bateman in American Psycho. I think it’s such a fun character. As far as what drew me to the movie, Bret sent me the treatment and we agreed to go out to dinner. He was sick of all the stereotypical Hollywood bullsh*t and just wanted to make something cheap and crowdfund it and make it with minimal money, but still make as professional a product as possible, and make something because of the desire to just create.                                                                                                     
                    Bret and I met through Twitter. He was working on the movie, and I get a decent amount of press and publicity just for the fact that I do porn and I have a young female audience and I’m also not the normal-looking porn guy. So Braxton Pope [one of the film’s producers] kept seeing my name pop up on his internet-Google-morning readings and stuff like that, and he was sending these articles to Bret and saying, “Hey, look at this guy. He’s interesting.”Brett started writing all these things on Twitter like, “Me and Braxton are working on this movie, and is it weird he wants to cast James Deen?” And people started telling me Bret Easton Ellis was talking about me on Twitter. I, of course, think he’s misspelled something and wasn’t actually talking about me, and then he starts writing about porn stars. So I kept an eye on it and watched it and eventually he wrote something about how in this movie porn star James Deen will do full-frontal nudity with guys and girls. I retweeted it and wrote “Party.” Then there was this media explosion with the Hollywood Reporter and TMZ and all sorts of stuff. So he and I started emailing back and forth and were like, “That was interesting. Should we talk about this?” That’s when I had dinner with him and he gave me the treatment. Then later he emailed and said, “Now we’ve got Lindsay,” and then it just kind of snowballed from there.                                                                                                    
                    It’s pretty much the same. The differences are so minimal and it’s hard to really explain. It’s really just like an attitude. The crew is pretty much the same; they’re awesome. I guess there are more egos in the Hollywood world, and in the mainstream world. With porn, you don’t get much ego.                                                                                                     
I read that you and director Paul Schrader had some pretty intense fights on set. Is that true, or just media spin?
                    Paul Schrader and I didn’t really have a fight. We had a strange moment. Paul Schrader’s got a decent ego on him, and there was this moment while we were talking and there was one scene were he was frustrated about certain things that were happening and I was trying to suggest something. He didn’t want to listen and was like, “I’m the director!” Of course I respect my director. Still, I was trying to explain and he blew up at me and I blew up at him, and we stared at each other for a moment, and it was this weird moment of, “I can’t really tell this guy I’m going to ruin his career.” It was a situation where he was completely powerless and I was frustrated because he was treating me inappropriately. He was basically frustrated with somebody else and then we kind of yelled at each other saying really nice things. We were outside yelling, so I can see why anyone inside would think we were fighting, but what we were yelling were things like, “How do you think I’m doing?” and “I think you’re doing a great job!” and “It’s an honor to work with you!” We were screaming at each other, but we were screaming compliments. We both just needed to blow off steam and have that release. They were the most flattering yells I’ve ever received.

=======================================================
James Deen comes off as a typical twenty-something dude working in the film industry, the kind you meet all the time in L.A. Except most of ‘em aren’t world-famous porn stars. As he aptly describes in his Twitter bio, “my name is james i am a simple guy who likes to eat sleep and watch tv… oh ya i also bang chicks for a living.”
He’s known as ladies’ favorite adult actor, but he’s breaking into mainstream Hollywood with “The Canyons,” in which he stars alongside Lindsay Lohan. (It’s a disturbing thriller that’s way less disturbing than his “Simpsons” and “Toy Story” XXX parodies.)
We hung out with Deen on the set of his latest porno to discuss his career and future, including a potential role in the film adaptation of “50 Shades Of Grey.”
I knew I wanted to be in porno since kindergarten… I mean, really I don’t have the exact time frame–just as long as I can remember, I wanted to do adult films.
I am not a prostitute! I get tons of emails from guys wanting to pay me to have sex with their wife or their girlfriend, which is actually something I’d probably do for free, but I’m not a whore.
Yeah, but there’s a performance aspect. Like, if a guy wanted to pay me to have sex with his wife in front of a group of people–or if it was some sort of live event and there was a performance element to it–then maybe I’d be down, but not to get paid to just have sex. I AM NOT A WHORE!
I don’t know that an average guy couldn’t be a porno star. The physical stuff you can work around; the real difference in being a performer is the mental aspect. You can be having a conversation about how your cat Fluffy just died, and then it’s time for the scene. You have to switch gears and become fully aroused and ready to perform, and you’ve gotta get Fluffy out of your head.
I originally said I was just going to do “The Canyons” and be done, but I had a lot of fun doing it. And if “50 Shades Of Grey” [producers] called me in to come audition, I’m gonna go in for an audition. If I never do another movie, that’s fine, but if I do “50 Shades Of Grey” and play Christian that’s awesome and I’d love to do that!
Honestly, there is none. I’ve set up a life where essentially I don’t have to do anything I don’t want to do.
I’m always ready to go. I keep my balls shaved at all times, and I don’t use Viagra, so I’m ready to film at a moment’s notice. Directors appreciate that.
Put it this way: you like cake, right? Sometimes you eat a lot of cake and you get full, right? So you take a break and then you want to eat some more cake.

The porn star, who has been in more than 1,000 adult films, raved about his sexual encounter with Teen Mom Farrah Abraham in an EXCLUSIVE interview! Read on to find out what James said.
Even though Teen Mom alum Farrah Abraham publicly slammed her porn co-star James Deen for discussing their XXX flick with the press, the professional adult film actor still insists the movie he made with the former MTV reality star is a must-see!
James has been featured in more than 1,000 adult films — it’s safe to say he’s slept with a good amount of women — but he still reveals to HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that Farrah’s performance was star quality:
The honest story is that we made a porno, its awesome. When it comes out, you should buy it because its really good. I think that is better than a concocted story to make it look like the tape was stolen, and it was very obvious that it wasn’t stolen. It would have been different if I was a random dude, but it’s me.
Even if Farrah is on a mission to slam James, don’t count on him reciprocating — he doesn’t want to deal with the drama:
My theory is not perpetuate any drama, there is no reason to talk s**t. So instead of saying that all that is a lie and this is the details of what happened, we should let it run its course. Let them talk s***t, I don’t care! What is the worst thing that is going to happen? ‘Oh you’re the guy that Teen Mom says is a bad guy,’ who cares! I am not worried about it! I feel like my actions speak louder then words.
What do YOU think of what James said, HollyMoms? Do you think their porn film will be successful? Let us know in the comments below!
I USED TO HAVE HIV,,,AND I WORK WITH THE U.S ARMY……I LOOKED FOR CURE ALMOST ROUND THE WORLD,NOT UNTIL I CONTACTED A GREAT SPIRITUALIST,I NARRATED MY PREDICAMENT TO HIM,I WAS SHOCKED HE SAID”NO CAUSE FOR ALARM”’I SEND HIM MY PHOTO,,,,HE SAID HE WILL NEED TO BUY SOME ITEMS,AND I PAID FOR IT…AFTER THREE DAYS HE TOLD ME TO GO FOR TEST AGAIN,……
MY FRIENDS YOU WON’T BELIEVE IT WAS NEGATIVE….NOW I’M SOUND AND HEALTHY STILL WORKING WITH THE U.S ARMY .
Farrah is a disgusting whore who will never stop begging for attention. But just like everything else in her life, including the plastic surgery…absolute FAIL!
Leanne you don’t know anything about Goddess Farrah. Actually James took advantage of her and then spread lies about her. Get your facts straight. Please save us from your stupidity and go kill yourself. Team Farrah and Lovatic for life.
Who are you to tell someone to go kill theirself because they don’t have the same opinion than you ? There’s actually people killing theirself because of some nasty comments like yours. Words have a weight that only intelligence can scale.
Farrah is disgusting.  She acted like such a little snot on teen mom.  I am sure her parents are very proud.  Her mom should raise Sophia.

100 Interviews is a Web site about people. For more information, go here. For all the stories in the initial One-Year 100 Interviews Project, go here.
“I’m just gonna go to his house,” I told a few people when they asked where I’d be interviewing James Deen. I tried to seem as casual as possible. The responses ranged from people thinking I was walking into a rape-trap, to wrinkled noses, to one friend who was convinced we were going to hook up. His assumption wasn’t unfounded. For months I’d been telling people I knew of James Deen, the young Jewish porn ingenue, from a Heeb Magazine article I’d read about him. This was a bold-faced lie. I knew of James Deen because I’ve watched his movies. In college, my friend Lee (the same one convinced James and I were going to bang) realized I liked nerdy Jews and directed me to James’s filmography. He definitely has his niche audience, uh, nailed.So I have a long-standing crush. Fine. I’m a journalist. I can be professional. Way in the beginning, I knew I wanted James for 100 Interviews because I think he represents a new kind of porn star, but I also worried about the personal aspect of the pieces I write here. I’d be lying if I wrote like I only knew of James from “reading the articles” to borrow a Playboy excuse. A few months ago, I decided to go for it anyway, tweeting at him, “What’s a girl got to do to get your email address?” I expected nothing. He’s got over 23,000 followers, most of them women. Within an hour, he direct messaged me. I told him I’d be in Los Angeles in June and we agreed to meet up and do the interview.
Friday, I had my friend Charlie drive me to James’s house, where he was actually packing up to move. Charlie had concerns. “I’m just gonna drop you off?,” he asked in the car. The conversation occurred in various forms in the days leading up to the interview. Charlie didn’t want to come inside with me and play ‘big brother,’ but he grappled with the idea of leaving a female friend in the clutches of a porn actor. Eventually, I convinced him to let me go alone.
But despite being so sure of myself and indignant about other people’s assumptions, I start to get nervous as soon as I spot James in 3D, real-life. My brain has a little “I’ve seen you have sex!” party. For the first time, as Charlie drives away, I worry this could get weird.James is 25 years old, and boyish, with curly brown hair and really blue eyes. He looks like any number of dudes I went to Hebrew school with. He’s wearing plaid shorts and a white shirt with the periodic table of elements on it. James is not his real name; he uses it because it’s what friends in junior high called him when he started smoking cigarettes and wearing leather jackets. As we walk up the sunny driveway, I tell him my friend had qualms about leaving me with him. Instead of being offended, James agrees. “I thought he’d at least want to come in,” he says.
We go inside and it’s just me and him. Alone. In his house. To cope with my anxiety, I rev my usual defense mechanism; when I find someone attractive, I tease them mercilessly like I’m Helga from ‘Hey Arnold.’ James 1) sees right through me and 2) seems to find it wildly amusing. 
For instance, when he pulls out a SEGA Genesis gaming system to pack into a box and wonders aloud why he even has it, I suggest it’s because he wants to be like Biggie, who sang the praises of the outdated technology. James laughs. “I could tell from your face you’re a girl who loves Biggie,” he quips.
Later, he tells me when fans ask him if “James Deen” is his real name,  he says it is  and that he also has a sister named “Oprah Winfrey.”  Three people have  believed him.
James grew up in Pasadena. He remembers seeing porn for the first time in kindergarten because a neighbor ditched some magazines along the horse trail he walked to get to school. He was already getting into trouble for kissing girls on the playground and the magazines painted a fuller picture of what came next.
"I thought, ‘Dude, this is awesome. This is what I want to do for a living,’" he says, describing himself as a kid who loved attention. "I always liked if something shocked people or wasn’t what was considered ‘right.’"
In the third grade, James says he was suspended for telling his classmates and teacher he wanted to “do porn” in a roundtable discussion about what the students wanted to be when they grew up. “It just made me want to do it even more,” he says. His childhood wasn’t troubled, he says, despite being “an angry, trouble-making kid.” He describes his parents as “awesome and supportive,” though his dad tells friends his son is “in the entertainment industry,” if they ask.
The origin story I’d read online about James’s porn career was that someone gave him the advice that if he could have sex in public, then he could do porn. James says this is mostly true.
It actually started one day when he was listening to ‘Love Line’ on the radio. The guest was porn legend Jenna Jameson. When they opened the lines for callers, a bunch of men called in to say things like, ‘I could fuck you better’ or ‘I could do porn. I have a huge dick.’ Eventually, Jenna  snapped.
"If you wanna do porn," she said on air, "get a folding chair and jerk off for 45  minutes with twenty people around you. When one of them  yells ‘Come!’ then you have to come within 30 seconds."
Instead of being intimidated like Jenna probably meant, James thought that was something he could do. He started going to parties and hooking up with girls in full view of the rest of the party-goers, sometimes having sex right in the middle of the action. He considered it practice.
But that was still a far cry from the actual industry. James says a lot of the people he told about his goal were skeptical. “It’s not all fun and games,” they warned. Once he turned 18, he went out in Hollywood and started meeting people involved in porn, particularly a stripper friend who put him in touch with some important people.
"It was easier than I expected," he says. "They weren’t yelling like, ‘YOU’RE TOO JEWISH AND SKINNY!’ at me." In the beginning, he says he had a difficult time getting hard because he was so nervous. In a moment of panic, he asked if he could have a second to figure it out. Obligingly, and to James’s surprise, the cameramen turned away and let him and the girl make out until his dick got hard. The rest of the scene went smoothly.
"I was pretty proud of myself but I was still going around asking, ‘How’d I do?’," he says. "People were like, ‘You did fine.’ I said, ‘Really? It was my first scene ever.’ Then, they were like, ‘Wait. First ever?! That was fucking amazing then! Holy shit.’”
His reputation is well-deserved. Usually, in porn, the girl takes center stage and while that’s still mostly the case in James’s movies, there’s something undeniably compelling about him. He’s not just a prop for some lady’s vagina; he’s got a distinct style that’s won him awards. There’s the lightly forceful hand around the throat and his penchant for whispering dirty, so the camera can’t hear every word, making it more intimate and sexy. You might be there for the girl, but you notice James. When I tell him this, he waves it off.
"I mean, I’m young and not ugly," he says. "I don’t want to seem like a narcissist. I don’t know. I really do think guys in porn are just props. People want to see girls having amazing sex with guys and I don’t think it really has to do with the guys," he pauses. "Then again, I have no idea what girls are looking for in porn so as long as I’m having fun, I don’t care too much."
I tell him I don’t entirely buy that. Porn is a small community, which James estimates is about 100 guys and 500 girls - 50 of them consistent. James is prolific; he’s made around 3,000 movies in seven years. But there must be something else about him that causes 23,000 people to be interested in his tweets.
"I’m not a douchebag?" he suggests. "If you bang chicks for money, you might get a douchebag complex." Plus, he says, it’s more socially acceptable to outwardly appreciate his work than that of a female porn star. For example, he was just in Budapest working for a site called PublicDisgrace.com (which is exactly what it sounds like) and the girls he was working with got jealous that he was getting recognized more often than they were.
"But it’s not that I’m more famous. It’s that I  think a dude is more inclined to go up to another guy and say they like his work in porn rather than to  a girl, because then it’s like, ‘Hey, I masturbated to you,’" he says. "But me? I’m not an object of sexual desire."
My red cheeks disagree, but er, anyway. In my initial email to him, I congratulated James on “living the dream.” His blog consists almost entirely of photos of the food and women he’s eaten. I ask him if he’s really got the best life ever. I expect some kind of “it’s not all glamor, burritos and shaved pussies” lament. There is none.
"I am happy-go-lucky," he says. "It’s a misconception that porn is just a lot of drugs or that everyone is doing it out of necessity. I mean, people do jobs they don’t like no matter what their job is but it’s really rare that someone is doing porn because they have to. Most of us are having a lot of fun. I’ve never been on a set where if a girl doesn’t want to do something, she was forced to." Like any movie, he says, the director would have to replace her. Even if she changed her mind, James says he would feel uncomfortable going forward knowing his partner had reservations. "I might then say, ‘I’m not doing this’ because then I’d be a creepy rapist with some girl who doesn’t want to do it," he says.Porn is changing a lot these days. James says it used to be that contract girls were handpicked for fame by “porno gods,” but now, because of the Internet, there’s a revolving door of newer, hotter girls competing every minute. James is clued in by working for the alt-porn site 'Burning Angel.' He keeps track of what aspects of the site keep visitors hooked, which girls are the most popular, what kinks subscribers prefer. “A DVD couldn’t do that,” he says. There are new Internet-age problems too, starting with the advent of Napster. James predicts in five years, people will no longer pay for anything online and porn will lose a key demographic, becoming unprofitable. He’s young, he says, and he can’t imagine going to a typical, real-life porn store.
I’m instantly more detached and comfortable with the business part of this discussion. ‘See!’ I  think. ‘Those haters were wrong. This is just another interview with a normal person.’
Then, James starts making a point about how even he feels dirty in a porn store. He says, “I have no shame. Name it, I’ve done it. If you want me to do it, I’m probably down.”
James and I are around the same age and actually come from similar backgrounds; Jewish day school and Jewish summer camp. As he’s packing up his closet, he pulls out a prayer shawl (tallis) from his bar mitzvah. Later, he reads the Hebrew tattoo I have between my shoulder blades by running his fingers across it through my apparently see-through yellow shirt without warning me. I want to sing the chorus of ‘Don’t Stand So Close To Me’ by the Police. "Oh my god," I reply, bringing my notebook up over my face. "Stop. I am trying to just get through this interview." My tone is girlish, unconvincing and for me, unusual. What is wrong with me right now? It’s this false sense that we know each other when we totally don’t. There’s a line that just…isn’t there, but I never feel uncomfortable. Just torn. "Ugh, you are the worst," I say, but I don’t mean it and it only makes him smile bigger.
Because being mean is the only way I know how to react when I’m attracted to someone, I point out a couple teddy bears he’s yet to pack. “What are those?” I ask.
"Those are my teddy bears," he says simply, shooting me a look like, ‘Try and make fun of me now.’ I’ve got nothing. He is standing way too close to me. I ask if having relationships is hard, being in porn.
"No more than in real life," he says, for the first time hesitating and thinking over his words. "Well…I don’t want to be creepy, but like, okay, take you and me," he pauses, gesturing between us. I tell him it’s cool when he seems unsure about asking: "Would you date me knowing I’m in porn?"
It’s a good question. I’d thought about what it would be like to sleep with him, I think that’s pretty clear. But date him? At first, I want to say I would. So far, I like him as a person. He’s quick and self-deprecating, the cornerstone qualities of sexy Jews. Despite what he thinks about himself on the job, he’s not just a dildo with a mouth. But he’s in the business of fantasy; Where’s the line between porn’s James Deen and the cool guy my own age talking to me in person? Before I can answer, he tries to diffuse the tension by joking, “I mean, I’m wearing a periodic  table shirt and I’ve been wearing it for three days straight while packing,” he smiles. “Are you sure you don’t want a piece  of this?”
"I go  to work and have sex with a different girl every day," he says. "Honestly, I usually have sex  with them when we hang out off-camera because I’m not very interesting."
"You calling it ‘work’ is pretty telling," I say, wondering if it’s weird for him to be talking to a girl and not having sex with her. It seems like he’s as flustered not having sex with me as I am not having sex with him.
"Yeah," he says. "Sex feels good and it’s really fun but there’s  all that crap behind sex that doesn’t need to be there. I get the whole sex is emotional thing but hanging out and  actually talking, seeing a movie, whatever, without having sex? That’s way more of a connection for me."
"Like, I fuck people I hate too. Sometimes it’s even more fun to  fuck someone you hate," he says. "But what is sex? You open your legs and I’m going to put  something in there? There are so many other things more emotional than sex."
On a basic level, I don’t disagree with him. Sex isn’t really a deciding factor in whether or not I feel close to someone. He adds that he wouldn’t care if his potential girlfriend also had sex with other people as long as she was safe and she made him a priority.
"If I feel special and she gives me  attention and she loves me and she’s just getting  her rocks off, then I don’t care," he says. "I actually like making out way more."
"I am all about  the making out,” he says. “It’s so innocent and amazing. Sex is like, so 2000s. If you  can find someone good at making out, that’s the real trick.”
I’m too busy babbling a response and I miss him jokingly asking me if I want to make out with him to prove it. I don’t ask him to  repeat it because, if he did, I do not trust what I’d say. It’s the way it’s phrased, “Do you want to make out?” because: Yep. Yes. I do. Am I going to? Nope. He doesn’t come across as predatory or entirely serious. He’s making fun of me in a different way than I’m making fun of him. But we’re both just…making fun.
"I just like making out with girls," he says. "It doesn’t really matter  if they make fun of me for having a bear." I roll my eyes.
Before coming to this interview, I thought about what I’d do if something happened because of the same stereotypes of the people I resented in the beginning. Is this my life or just the beginning of a movie that ends with the bespectacled female journalist on her knees? It’s a porn cliche so inherent that it’s laughable. Sleeping with him right now would be the  ‘Inception’ of fucking, where all I’m worried about is what’s real and  what isn’t real or if it even matters in the end. We both understand that, and we’re both out of our comfort zones because of it. I can’t just mindlessly ask questions; he can’t fuck his way out. But damn, are we both going to try.
"I never paid attention to shit like that," he says. "Honestly, they can fuck off. If someone came in here like, ‘What you do is a sin!’ I’d probably just start getting naked and if they wanted to stay here and yell at me, I’d start jerking off. ‘You wanted  to make it awkward for me? Now I made it awkward for you,’" he says. I’m laughing pretty hard. "As long as you’re not hurting  anybody? Who cares?"
He starts to say something about playing basketball then, but he fucks up the metaphor in a really obvious way. It’s clear he doesn’t know anything about sports.
"So much better than that other team from the other town where I don’t live!" I say. And then, we’re both giggling insanely. It feels way more like the friends we might be at a Jewish summer camp in another dimension. "This is like, an Onion headline," I say, through my laughter. He cracks up, echoing my earlier teasing, "Go sports! Yeah! Whatever guys do when they hang out!" He clearly has no idea. Earlier, he’d told me he doesn’t really see friends ever.
While he’s giggling, I tease him that my friend Charlie’s worries about him were totally unfounded. “You’re not dangerous at all,” I say. “You’ve got teddy bears and you don’t even know what basketball is.” James shakes his head, “Just for that, now you’re getting finger-blasted,” he threatens, pretending to be tough. “Oh, sure,” I say, because now that we’re joking about it, it’s somehow less likely?
Downstairs, I ask if I can take a video of him with my Flip camera. What I don’t anticipate is the absurd, direct similarity the situation has to the porno I keep worrying I’m already in. Even with some of my more attractive interviewees, I’ve remained friendly, but stone-cold. But watching James through the viewfinder of the camera was oddly familiar, even if it wasn’t particularly sexually charged. It’s how he looks in his films, only he’s talking to me, interacting with me. I’ve only ever seen this end in sex.
But now, we’re also joking like any normal twenty-somethings would. Him doing porn doesn’t make him not a person. He’s putting cleaning supplies in a box while I talk to him. He’s moving houses; something we’ve all probably done. It’s strangely neutralizing, but no less surreal.
After he tells a story about some radio DJs using a clip of him joking that he got fucked in the ass as a soundbite, I ask if he has a PR person. He says he doesn’t. I tell him I was surprised by how easy it was to get in touch with him.
He smirks and it’s totally killer. “I looked at your pictures first,” he whispers. I don’t hear him right away and then when I do, I gasp and get tongue-tied. He’s got me again. He laughs, “I am that sleazy. I totally am.”
And then, just like in a porno, I gesture to myself, “How does it live up to real life?” I ask, all sirens firing off in my brain. (Picture old-timey footage of Russian missile launches.) 'Come on, Gaby,' I think. ‘Cut it out.’ But even then, it’s not ever real. I’m testing myself on his playing field. I’m trying out being him.
James gives a thumbs up (and later calls me “a babe, duh”). I feel bad but I’m kind of enjoying the attention. I wonder if inviting young female journalists over for flirt sessions is a common occurrence. I don’t think it is, just from the way we’ve been trading off who’s more flustered. I push through with starting to ask the next question but I end up snorting and laughing. “Oh my god,” I whine. “I don’t know how I can simultaneously hate and enjoy you.”
"We’ll see!" I reply and then, practically skip back to the car. Charlie only mocks my blushing for the first ten minutes, like a good friend would.
I haven’t tried, but I’m wondering if I can enjoy his work in the same way now that I know him off-camera. Was his flirting even real or just a part of his natural interaction with women that he can’t actually turn off? Is the only way either of us knew how to act around each other as if we were the first five minutes of one of his films? Did I just cross some kind of fourth wall never meant to be broken? Does it make his movies better now that I know he’s an awesome person — or does that make it weird?
During the interview, I ask James about the old porn warning; what if  you don’t always want to do porn? What if one day you want to run for  President? It’s a stupid thing people say out of fear. James says that’s  not the way his life’s going; if he wanted to run for President, he  would be planning on running for President. Plus, he says, it’s actually  more common for people to get into porn, do it for a little while and  then decide it was fun but not for them, than it is to become a staple  of the industry. There are always a million reasons not to do something,  and I strangely admire his certainty. “I don’t really know what people think and if I did, if people are like, ‘Oh, what an asshole’ or ‘Oh, I  totally expected that from him’ or ‘Oh, I’m so happy for him. I’m gonna call him  and be his friend now when I wasn’t before,’ I mean, is it really gonna  change anything at the end of the day?” he says. Later, he adds: “I don’t think anyone  should be restricted from what they want to do.”

“My name is James. I am a simple guy who likes to eat, sleep, and watch TV. Oh yeah, I also bang chicks for a living.”
So goes the Twitter bio of 25-year-old porn actor James Deen. 24,000 followers might not stand out in the ranks of mainstream celebrities, but for a man who most would say is merely a prop, Deen has quite the fan base. Most of those followers are women, and they are not quiet about their affection. “Reading James Deen’s blog until my parents walk in,” tweets one young woman. Another bemoans forgetting to download True Blood because she was too busy fantasizing about him.
A step further, to Deen’s personal blog, reveals an intensity of adoration normally reserved for swishy-haired pop stars. Among declarations of love and lust and women begging for personal visits – more than one requesting devirginization – a vocal group coalesces around this sentiment: “I’m a girl, and most dudes in porn do nothing for me. Then I stumbled across a clip of you”¦ it’s been lust at first sight ever since.” What magic pheromones does Deen emit that he’s earned the infatuation of his fans, the respect of his costars, and the porn industry’s top awards? There’s something special about this guy, and it isn’t his penis.
Sunday afternoon, while large chunks of the country cheered on the women of Team USA, I detached myself from my television to talk to a porn star who maintains a firm “no panties” rules on his website (and I call myself a feminist). I wanted to know where he came from, and how he thinks about his work. How, in an industry known for its seedy underbelly, did a decent guy like Deen come out on top?
He’s objectively good-looking, with curly brown hair, long sideburns, and very blue eyes. The word “impish” comes to mind. “I’m not hideous,” he says while trying to explain his popularity, “I’m not old and ugly. For the percentage of women interested in porn, I’m a guy who they would talk to in a bar.”
He says “percentage of women” like it’s a teaspoon of water in the ocean of smut, and it occurs to me that he doesn’t know how popular he is. I tell him that the latest data from Nielsen shows that a third of porn site visitors are female. “What? That’s awesome! I had no idea it was so high!”
I ask him why he’s so pleased, and he says, “The world is becoming a more sexually liberated place, you know? People are more out there with their porn watching. It’s super cool.”
Deen is a behind-the-camera guy, too, directing, producing, and editing for punk mega-site BurningAngel. “If you’re going to make porn, you should make something you’re really passionate about; it’ll be good, and people will watch it. Like me, I’m not really into feet “¦ unless it really turns a girl on. But boobs? I love boobs, I could play with boobs for hours. If I make porn about boobs, it’ll be good, because you can tell how much I like them. Not so much with feet.”
From the other side of the camera, he pushes for pleasure, too. “Whenever I’m directing, I hire performers that love what they’re doing. I put them in a room together and tell them to do whatever you want, and they go at it.” He laughs and tells me a story about a friend who spends “too much” time on foreplay: “Twenty minutes later, I’m like, “˜Dude, this is hot, but would you fuck her already?’”
We talk about rough sex, a specialty of his. “A lot of the porn for women and couples is intentionally inoffensive and soft, but I don’t know any girls who have ever watched Playgirl. Sometimes girls just want to see a guy who will fuck the shit out of them. Rough sex is a science, and I’m really good at it.” Thanks to his experience in this arena, Deen is regularly requested for scenes at BDSM conglomerate Kink.com.
He speaks like a teenager, chortling at his own jokes, punctuating sentences with “whatever” and “fuck it.” But when talk turns to the industry, Deen peppers his conversation with lingo like a consummate professional. Degrees of degradation, levels of consent, variations of kink, this is the language of the biz, and he’s more than fluent. “It’s a job, you know? Like a bank job,” he explains. “You show up on time, don’t be drunk, don’t bring drugs, be polite, be professional.” It sounds too good to be true.
I bring up the M-word, misogyny. Are sets actually as polite and above-board as he’s implying? “I just had this conversation! This dude was like, “˜You can’t get sexually harassed on a porn set,’ and I was like, “˜Dude! Are you kidding? Of course you can! A guy can’t just randomly come up to a girl and start waving his dick in her face – that’s sexual harassment!’”
What about those other sites, with names so offensive I wince as I say them out loud? He tells me a story about a scene so aggressive and violent that he received hate mail and death threats.
“I was like, “˜Hey man, that was my girlfriend.’” The point, he emphasizes, is that “it’s all totally fake.” All of it? “Take these two different sites that look the same,” he says, describing sites that play in the space of extreme degradation. One site is “brilliant. Everyone thinks it’s about degradation and making girls cry, really rough, fucked-up stuff; before every scene, they do an interview with the girl. They talk very specifically about what kind of scene it is. “˜It’ll be degrading, there will be this and that.’ The majority of girls are like, “˜OK, awesome, bring it on.’” But what about the other site? “Oh, well, those guys are misogynistic assholes,” he says. “They just want to hurt women. They suck.” As a viewer, I probably couldn’t tell the difference.
The lines get blurry when porn gets as rough as Deen likes it. He tells me about a site he recently stopped working for because he didn’t like the premise. “Girls acted like they did something “˜bad,’ like step on my shoe,” he describes, “and then I’d have rough sex to punish them. It made me feel icky.” I want him to clarify, after all, he makes a living slapping women around onscreen. “At Kink, this girl and I are having awesome sex and she likes to get slapped in the face. The sex isn’t punishment. It’s BDSM lifestyle, and they make it super clear it’s the girl’s fantasy.”
It’s the distinction between power play that is built on a foundation of consent and pleasure, and sex that comes from a place of anger and resentment. His fans have noticed on which side of the line he falls. “He gets the difference between dominance and domineering. It’s so sexy!” says one, a 30-something mom from Missouri.
I read that Deen once bemoaned the lack of cunnilingus on camera, explaining that he loves giving oral sex, but directors didn’t want to waste film on it. Is this a problem, that kids grow up seeing blowjobs but not “box jobs,” as Dan Savage recently called female oral sex? The younger we are, the more porn influences what we think is “normal.” Does porn give kids the wrong idea? He pauses, carefully considering my question. “Yes,” he says, “Yes, you’re right. Young kids are learning that pussy-eating isn’t part of sex.” He laughs, emphatically declaring, “There should be more pussy-eating in porn!” Work on that, I tell him, and he says he will. Then he reminds me that viewers only watch what they like. “Their hands are on the fast-forward button the whole time.” He’s right. A quick and dirty search shows that pussy-eating isn’t as popular as one might hope.
During this interview, at every point where I’ve asked him to choose a side, Deen defaults to “equal rights.” Are you a feminist, I ask?
“I hate feminism!” he blurts out, but rushes to rephrase. “In its truest form, I’m down with feminism, but the feminist movement has gone from being about equal rights–something I really believe in–to telling me how horrible I am because I have a penis. That shit drives me crazy.”
I tell him I’m a feminist and I don’t hate penises; he seems pleased. Our conversation is winding down. It is, after all, a Sunday afternoon, and porn star or not, Deen has laundry to do. I feel strange, like in the last two hours my best hopes and worst fears about pornography have been confirmed. There are good, smart people like James Deen and his friends who are committed to making super-hot porn that is grounded in equality, pleasure, and consent. And yet, Deen has proven, perhaps inadvertently, that I won’t necessarily know it when I see it. None of us do, and that should make us all a little uncomfortable.

This was a fascinating interview. I’ve worked for Kink, but I’ve never met James. Thanks for this quick introduction.
You know, I disagree that we can’t know ethical porn when we see it; if you can’t tell, it’s not ethical. That’s what I appreciate about Kink– they make sure you know this is about having fun, not ‘punishment,’ and I think that’s part of their responsibility.
Where does someone in their mid-twenties get the idea that feminism = man-hating?? That shit drives me crazy too. Is someone feeding everyone Andrea Dworkin, or something?
Because thinking about things in complexities is overrated. Also, mass representation of stereotypes is a good formula that usually subscribes to peoples comfort zones.
I think craploads of misconceptions abound about feminism, even (especially?) among young people. I took a women’s health class that was offered in the health education department last year, and it was made up of a combination of BA and MA students; our discussion of feminism in the first class was just painful. (“I support equality and everything, but they take it too far – I like men!”) 
Somehow feminism becomes ‘Amazonian misandrist lesbians’ in popular speak. I get it not. Sometimes I think we need a new word for gender equality and social justice in gender terms, but any replacements (equalist?) just seem sappy or anti-feminist. Sigh.
Sadly, it’s pretty easy. I’m in my mid-twenties, and a lot of my early exposure to feminism WAS man-hating/bashing. People who self-identified as feminists or made “feminist” statements were never about equality. I even had a few professors in college who were just terrible to the men in class, basically because they deserved to be treated as lesser to atone for the sins of the patriarchy, so to speak.
I think people in their mid-twenties are removed from really knowing about the ERA, and our exposure to feminism has been a lot of hyperbole from both sides. Unless you go looking for it and try to educate yourself, it’s hard to have a good understanding of the feminist movement and where it is today.
