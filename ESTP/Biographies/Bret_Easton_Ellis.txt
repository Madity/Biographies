=======================================================
Bret Easton Ellis (born March 7, 1964) is an American novelist, screenwriter, and short story writer. His works have been translated into 27 languages.[1] He was at first regarded as one of the so-called literary Brat Pack,[2] which also included Tama Janowitz and Jay McInerney. He is a self-proclaimed satirist, whose trademark technique, as a writer, is the expression of extreme acts and opinions in an affectless style.[3][4] Ellis employs a technique of linking novels with common, recurring characters.
Though Ellis made his debut at 21 with the controversial 1985 bestseller Less Than Zero, a zeitgeist novel about wealthy amoral young people in Los Angeles, the work he is most known for is his third novel, 1991's American Psycho. On its release, the literary establishment widely condemned the novel as overly violent and misogynistic. Though many petitions to ban the book saw Ellis dropped by Simon & Schuster, the resounding controversy convinced Alfred A. Knopf to release it as a paperback later that year. Four of Ellis' works have been made into films. Less Than Zero was rapidly adapted for screen, leading to the release of a starkly different Less Than Zero film in 1987. Mary Harron's adaptation of American Psycho was released to predominantly positive reviews in 2000, and went on to achieve cult status. In later years, Ellis' novels have become increasingly metafictional. 2005's Lunar Park, a pseudo-memoir and ghost story, received positive reviews, and 2010s Imperial Bedrooms, marketed as a sequel to Less Than Zero, continues in this vein.
Ellis was born in Los Angeles to a middle class California household and raised in Sherman Oaks in the San Fernando Valley. His father, Robert Martin Ellis, was a property developer, and his mother, Dale (Dennis) Ellis, was a homemaker.[5] They divorced in 1982. Ellis stated, during the initial release of his third novel American Psycho that his father was abusive and he became the basis of that book's most well-known character Patrick Bateman. Later, Ellis claimed that the character was not in fact based on his father, but on Ellis himself. Saying that all of his work came from a specific place of pain he was going through in his life during the writing of each of his books. Ellis claims that while his family life growing up was some what difficult due to the divorce, he mostly had an 'idyllic' California childhood.[6] Ellis was educated at The Buckley School; he then attended Bennington College in Vermont, originally studying music, then gradually gravitating to writing, which was one of his passions since he was a child. Here he met and befriended Donna Tartt and Jonathan Lethem, whom both would later become published writers. Bennington College was also where Ellis completed a novel he had been working on for many years. That book would be Less Than Zero and would go on to be published while Ellis was just 21 and still in college- thus propelling him to instant fame.
After the success and controversy of Less Than Zero in 1985, Ellis became closely associated and good friends with fellow Brat Pack writer Jay McInerney: the two became known as the "toxic twins" for their highly publicized, late night, debauchery. The writer became a pariah for a time following the release of American Psycho (1991), which later became a critical and cult hit, more so after its 2000 movie adaptation. It is now regarded as Ellis' magnum opus and is favorably looked upon by academics. The Informers (1994) was offered to his publisher during Glamorama's long writing history. Ellis wrote a screenplay for The Rules of Attraction's film adaptation which was not used. Ellis records a fictionalized version of his life story up until this point in the first chapter of Lunar Park (2005). After the death of his lover Michael Wade Kaplan, Ellis was spurred to finish Lunar Park and inflected it with a new tone of wistfulness.[7]
Ellis was approached by young screenwriter Nicholas Jarecki to adapt The Informers into a film; the script they co-wrote was cut from 150 to 94 pages and taken from Jarecki to give to Australian director Gregor Jordan, whose light-on-humor vision of the film was met with unanimously negative reviews[citation needed] when the film was released in 2009.
Despite setbacks as a screenwriter, Ellis teamed up with acclaimed director Gus Van Sant in 2009 to adapt the Vanity Fair article "The Golden Suicides" into a film of the same name, depicting the paranoid final days and suicides of celebrity artists Theresa Duncan and Jeremy Blake. The film, as of 2014, has never been made. When Van Sant appeared on The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast on February 12, 2014, he stated that he was never attached to the project as a screenwriter or a director, merely a consultant, claiming that the material seemed to tricky for him to properly render on screen. Ellis and Van Sant mentioned that Naomi Watts and Ryan Gosling were approached to star as Duncan and Blake, respectively. Ellis confirmed that he and his producing partner Braxton Pope are still working on the project, with Ellis revisiting the screenplay from time to time. As of April 2014, radical filmmaker Gaspar Noé was officially attached to direct if the film went into production, but he proved troublesome to work with due to his erratic behavior.[6]
In 2010, Ellis released Imperial Bedrooms, the sequel to his début novel. Ellis wrote it following his return to LA and fictionalizes his work on the film adaptation of The Informers, from the perspective of Clay. Positive reviews felt it was a culmination of the themes begun respectively in Less Than Zero, American Psycho and Lunar Park.[citation needed] Negative reviews noted the novel's rehashed themes and listless writing.[citation needed]
Ellis expressed interest in writing the screenplay for the Fifty Shades of Grey film adaptation. He discussed casting with his followers, and even mentioned meeting with the film's producers, as well as noting he felt it went well.[8][9][10] The job eventually went to Kelly Marcel, Patrick Marber and Mark Bomback.[11]
In 2012, Ellis wrote the screenplay for the independent film The Canyons and helped raise money for its production.[12] The film was released in 2013 and although critically panned, was a small financial success, with the performance of Lindsay Lohan in the lead role earning some positive reviews.
When asked in an interview in 2002 whether or not he was gay, Ellis explained that he does not identify himself as gay or straight. He explained that he is comfortable to be thought of as homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual and that he enjoys playing with his persona, identifying variously as gay, straight, and bisexual to different people over the years.[13]
In a 1999 interview, the author puts forward that his reluctance to definitively label his sexuality is for "artistic reasons". He commented "if people knew that I was straight, they'd read [my books] in a different way. If they knew I was gay, 'Psycho' would be read as a different book."[14] In an interview with Robert F. Coleman, Ellis refers to his as an "indeterminate sexuality", and said "any other interviewer out there will get a different answer and it just depends on the mood I am in".[15] In a 2011 interview with James Brown, Ellis again states that his answers to questions about his sexuality have varied from interviewer to interviewer, citing an example where his reluctance to refuse the label "bi" had him labelled as such by a Details interviewer. "I think the last time I slept with a woman was five or six years ago, so the bi thing can only be played out so long," he clarifies. "But I still use it, I still say it."[16] Responding to Dan Savage's It Gets Better campaign, aimed at preventing suicide among LGBT youth, Ellis tweeted "Not to bum everyone out, but can we get a reality check here? It gets worse."[17] In a 2012 op-ed for The Daily Beast, while apologizing for a series of controversial tweets, Ellis identified himself as a gay man.[18]
Lunar Park was dedicated to his lover, Michael Wade Kaplan, and Ellis's father, Robert Ellis. Robert Ellis died in 1992. In one interview, Ellis describes feeling a liberation, in the completion of the novel, that allowed him to come to terms with unresolved issues regarding his father.[19] In the "author Q&A" for Lunar Park on the Random House website, Ellis comments on his relationship with his father, and says he feels that his father was a "tough case" who left him damaged. Having grown older and having "mellow[ed] out", Ellis describes how his opinion of his father changed since 15 years ago when writing Glamorama (in which the central conspiracy concerns the relationship of a father and son).[20] Even earlier in his career, Ellis based the character of Patrick Bateman from American Psycho on his father.[21] In a 2010 interview, however, he claims to have "lied" about this explanation. Explaining that "Patrick Bateman was about me", he confesses "I didn’t want to finally own up to the responsibility of being Patrick Bateman, so I laid it on my father, I laid it on Wall Street." In reality, the book had been "about me at the time, and I wrote about all my rage and feelings".[15] To James Brown, he clarified Bateman was based on "my father a little bit but I was living that lifestyle; my father wasn’t in New York the same age as Patrick Bateman, living in the same building, going to the same places that Patrick Bateman was going to".[16]
Ellis' first novel, Less Than Zero, a tale of disaffected, rich teenagers of Los Angeles written and re-written over a five-year period from Ellis' sophomore year in high school, earlier drafts being "[...] more autobiographical and read like teen diaries or journal entries—lots of stuff about the bands I liked, the beach, the Galleria, clubs, driving around, doing drugs, partying", according to Ellis.[22] The novel was praised by critics and sold well (50,000 copies in its first year). He moved back to New York City in 1987 for the publication of his second novel, The Rules of Attraction - described by Ellis as "[...] an attempt to write the kind of college novel I had always wanted to read and could never find"[22] - which follows a group of sexually promiscuous college students. Influenced heavily by James Joyce's Ulysses and its stream-of-consciousness narrative technnique, ...Attraction sold fairly well, though Ellis admits he felt he had "fallen off", after the novel failed to match the success of his debut effort, Ellis reflecting in 2012 " I was very obsessive, very protective about that book, perhaps overly so".[22] His most controversial work is the graphically violent American Psycho, which Ellis states "[...] came out of a place of severe alienation and loneliness and self-loathing. I was pursuing a life—you could call it the Gentlemen’s Quarterly way of living—that I knew was bullshit, and yet I couldn’t seem to help it.".[22] The book was intended to be published by Simon & Schuster, but they withdrew after external protests from groups such as the National Organization for Women (NOW) and many others due to the allegedly misogynistic nature of the book. The novel was later published by Vintage. Some consider this novel, whose protagonist, Patrick Bateman, is both a cartoonishly materialistic yuppie and a serial killer, to be an example of transgressive art. American Psycho has achieved considerable cult status.
Ellis's collection of short stories, The Informers, was published in 1994. It contains vignettes of wayward Los Angeles characters ranging from rock stars to vampires, mostly written while Ellis was in college, and so has more in common with the style of Less Than Zero. Ellis has said that the stories in The Informers were collected and released only to fulfill a contractual obligation after discovering that it would take far longer to complete his next novel than he'd intended. After years of struggling with it, Ellis released his fourth novel Glamorama in 1998. Glamorama is set in the world of high fashion, following a male model who becomes entangled in a bizarre terrorist organization composed entirely of other models. The book plays with themes of media, celebrity, and political violence, and like its predecessor American Psycho it uses surrealism to convey a sense of postmodern dread. Although the reactions to the novel were mixed, Ellis holds it in high esteem among his own works: "[...] it’s probably the best novel I’ve written and the one that means the most to me. And when I say “best”—the wrong word, I suppose, but I’m not sure what else to replace it with—I mean that I’ll never have that energy again, that kind of focus sustained for eight years on a single project. I’ll never spend that amount of time crafting a book that means that much to me. And I think people who have read all of my work and are fans understand that about Glamorama—it’s the one book out of the seven I’ve published that matters the most."[22] Ellis's novel Lunar Park (2005), uses the form of a celebrity memoir to tell a ghost story about the novelist "Bret Easton Ellis" and his chilling experiences in the apparently haunted home he shares with his wife and son. In keeping with his usual style, Ellis mixes absurd comedy with a bleak and violent vision.
In 2010, Ellis released a follow-up to Less Than Zero entitled Imperial Bedrooms (2010). Taking place 25 years after the events of Ellis' debut novel, it combines the postmodernism of Lunar Park with the unaltered ennui of Less Than Zero. The book was met with disappointing sales.
For writing the original screenplay for the Paul Schrader directed film The Canyons, Ellis won the 'Best Screenplay' award at the 14th Melbourne Underground Film Festival, with the film also winning 'Best Foreign Film', 'Best Foreign Director' for Schrader and 'Best Female Actor' for Lindsay Lohan.
Ellis often uses recurring characters and settings. Major characters in one novel may become minor ones in the next, or vice versa. Camden College, a fictional New England liberal arts college, is frequently referenced. It is based on Bennington College, which Ellis himself attended, where he met future novelist Jonathan Lethem and befriended fellow writers Donna Tartt and Jill Eisenstadt. In Tartt's The Secret History (1992), her version of Bennington is given as "Hampden College", although there are oblique connections between it and Ellis' Rules of Attraction. Eisenstadt and Lethem, however, use 'Camden' in From Rockaway (1987) and The Fortress of Solitude (2003), respectively. Though his three major settings are Vermont, Los Angeles and New York, he doesn't think of these novels as about these places; they are intentionally more universal than that.[23]
Camden is introduced in Less Than Zero, where it is mentioned that both protagonist Clay and minor character Daniel attend it. In The Rules of Attraction (1987), where Camden is the setting, Clay (referred to as "The Guy from L.A." before being properly introduced) is a minor character who narrates one chapter; ironically, he longs for the Californian beach, where in Ellis' previous novel he had longed to return to college. On "the guy from L.A.'s door someone wrote "Rest in Peace Called"; R.I.P., or Rip, is Clay's dealer in Less Than Zero; Clay also says that Blair from Less than Zero sent him a letter saying she thinks Rip was murdered. Main character Sean Bateman's older brother Patrick narrates one chapter of the novel; he will be the infamous central character of Ellis' next novel, American Psycho. Ellis includes a reference to Tartt's forthcoming Secret History in the form of a passing mention of "that weird Classics group... probably roaming the countryside sacrificing farmers and performing pagan rituals". There is also an allusion to the main character from Eisenstadt's From Rockaway.
In American Psycho (1991), Patrick's brother Sean appears briefly. Paul Denton and Victor Johnson from The Rules of Attraction are both mentioned; on seeing Paul, Patrick wonders if "maybe he was on that cruise a long time ago, one night last March. If that's the case, I'm thinking, I should get his telephone number or, better yet, his address." Camden is referred to as both Sean's college and the college a minor character named Vanden is going to. Vanden was referred to (but never appeared) in both Less Than Zero and The Rules of Attraction. Passages from "Less Than Zero" reappear, almost verbatim, here, with Patrick replacing Clay as narrator. Patrick also makes repeated references to Jami Gertz, the actress who portrays Blair in the 1987 film adaptation of Less Than Zero. Allison Poole from Jay McInerney's 1988 novel Story of My Life appears as a torture victim of Patrick's. 1994's The Informers features a much-younger Timothy Price, one of Patrick's co-workers in American Psycho, who narrates one chapter. One of the central characters, Graham, buys concert tickets from Less Than Zero's Julian, and his sister Susan goes on to say that Julian sells heroin and is a male prostitute (as shown in Zero). Alana and Blair from Zero are also friends of Susan's. Letters to Sean Bateman from a Camden College girl named Anne visiting grandparents in LA comprise the eighth chapter.
Patrick Bateman appears briefly in Glamorama (1998); Glamorama's main characters Victor Ward and Lauren Hynde were first introduced in The Rules of Attraction. As an in-joke reference to Bateman being portrayed by Christian Bale in the then-in-production 2000 film adaptation, the actor himself briefly appears as a background character. The book also includes a spy called Russell who is physically identical to Bale, and at one point in the novel impersonates him. Jamie Fields, who has a major role in the book, was first briefly mentioned by Victor in The Rules of Attraction. Bertrand, Sean and Mitchell, all from The Rules of Attraction, appear in Camden flashbacks and several other Rules characters are referenced. McInerney's Alison Poole makes her second appearance in an Ellis novel as Victor's mistress. Lunar Park (2005) is not set in the same "universe" as Ellis' other novels, but contains a similar multitude of references and allusions. All the author's previous works are heavily referenced, in keeping with the book-within-a-book structure. Jay McInerney cameos. Donald Kimball from American Psycho questions Ellis on a series of American Psycho-inspired murders, Mitchell Allen from Rules lives next door to and went to college with Ellis (Ellis even recalls his affair with Paul Denton, alluded to in Rules), and Ellis recalls a tempestuous relationship with Blair from Zero. Imperial Bedrooms (2010) establishes the conceit that the Clay depicted in Zero is not the same Clay who narrates Bedrooms. In the world of Imperial Bedrooms, Zero was the close-to-non-fiction work of an author friend of Clay's, and its film adaptation (featuring actors Andrew McCarthy, Jami Gertz and Robert Downey, Jr.) exists within the world of the novel, too.
On his podcast, Ellis stated that he is always working on a new novel, but does not know which ones will ever end up getting published.[24]
2005 - Le grand journal de Canal+ (episode: "Episode dated 26 October 2005" - aired October 26, 2005)
2005 - Campus, le magazine de l'écrit (episode: "Ainsi voit Lionel Jospin..." - aired November 3, 2005)
2010 - Le grand journal de Canal+ (episode: "Episode dated 20 September 2010", aired - September 20, 2010)
2008 - The Informers (screenplay by Bret Easton Ellis and Nicolas Jarecki, directed by Gregor Jordan)
In May, 2014, Bravo announced that it has teamed up with The Rules of Attraction feature film adaptation writer/director Roger Avary and producer Greg Shapiro to develop a limited-run series based on Ellis' novel. The plot of the show will stray from the source material and is described as follows: "Inspired by the book and film of the same name, the high concept series takes the students and faculty at the fictional Camden College and unravels a murder mystery by telling the same story through 12 different points of view. Children of the 1%-er’s live as unhinged and wild adults in a Bret Easton Ellis world with seemingly no rules to hold these privileged few down." Titled Rules of Attraction the series will be written by Roger Avary (The Rules of Attraction, Beowulf) for Lionsgate TV with Greg Shapiro (Zero Dark Thirty) serving as an Executive Producer.[28]
According to IMDB, Ellis' novels Glamorama, Lunar Park and Imperial Bedrooms are all in various development stages of pre-production to be turned into feature films, but no other information is available at this time. A remake of American Psycho is also apparently in the works, without Ellis' involvement. He confirmed this on his Twitter page in early 2014.
Fox Broadcasting Company announced plans for Ellis to write a 10-part limited-run series set in Los Angeles, California during August of 1969 when the Charles Manson murders occurred. Rob Zombie is attached to direct the series and will follow a variety of characters in the city and the reaction and connections they have to the notorious Manson Murders.[32]
As of the spring of 2014, Ellis has been filming in and around Los Angeles, California. On his Podcast he had stated that he writes scenes and then when certain locations, equipment and his actors are available, they will spontaneously shoot the material, with Ellis directing. He has also stated via his Podcast, his Twitter, his Instagram and his Facebook that he does not know what form this project will take when they complete it. It could be a feature film or a web-series. The project's producer, and Ellis' producing parter Braxton Pope, has been regularly posting updates and pictures from the production on his Facebook and Instagram accounts.
On November 18, 2013, Ellis launched a podcast with PodcastOne Studios. The aim for the show, which delivers 1 hour segments, is to have Ellis engage in open and honest conversation with his guests about their work, inspirations, life experiences as well as music and movies. Ellis, who has always been adverse to publicity, has been using the platform to engage in intellectual conversation and debate about his own theoretical observations on the media, the film industry, the music scene and the analog vs. digital age in a generational context. Notable guests have included Kanye West, Marilyn Manson, Judd Apatow, Chuck Klosterman, Kevin Smith, Michael Ian Black, Matt Berninger, Brandon Boyd, BJ Novak, Gus Van Sant, Joe Swanberg, Ezra Koenig, Stephen Malkmus, John Densmore, Fred Armisen & Carrie Brownstein, Ivan Reitman and Adam Carolla.
"Controversial best-selling author and screenwriter Bret Easton Ellis delivers a weekly glimpse into one of popular culture's most fascinating minds. The entertainment industry's top writers, directors, actors and musicians will join Bret to discuss the issues and complexities that keep the creative world turning as we experience this intriguing period in our planet's history. The same sensibilities that have formed Bret's impressive catalog in literature and film will be on display with each and every new episode of The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast."[33]

“My work is really about a culture that pisses me off, and a world that we live in that values all the wrong things.” -New York Times Interview with Bret Easton Ellis
At the age of 41, Bret Easton Ellis is considered to be one of America's most important generation X writers, with his infamy heightened by the controversy of his third novel, American Psycho. But American Psycho certainly isn't the limit of Ellis's work, nor is he a one trick pony riding off it's success. His work contains recurring themes of young, wealthy people who indulge in excess and depravity, who are morally bankrupt and relish it. He reuses characters, locations, and in his most recent work, Luna Park has used himself as the main character, blurring the line between fiction and reality.
Bret Easton Ellis was born on March 7, 1964 in Los Angeles California. Just to clarify, his name is not Brett Easton Ellis, but "Bret". He was raised by his parents, Robert Martin Ellis, and Dale Ellis, in Sherman Oakes in the San Fernando Valley. His father was a wealthy property developer, and was also an abusive alcoholic who has by all accounts influenced the Ellis's writing. His upbringing was privelleged; he attended The Buckley School which was a housed wealthy children of film industry parents. Ellis's parents seperated around the time he was graduating from high-school, in 1982. By that time, Ellis had already written three novels, the last of which would serve as the basis for his first novel, Less Than Zero.
Ellis went on to attend Bennington College, on which he often bases fictitious colleges in his writing. He studied music but then switched to writing, and it was here that he met Joe McGinnis and was put onto a literary agent. He published Less Than Zero, his first novel, while still in college in 1985. Less Than Zero was met with critical acclaim and did extremely well. It was made into a film two years later. He then moved to New York around this time to release his second novel, Rules Of Attraction, which was criticised as being too autobiographical and never recieved the attention that his other novels have.
While in New York, Ellis decided to capture the 80's and spent time hanging out with stock-brokers in preparation for American Psycho. However, when the time came for publication, there was an uproar about the graphically violent content and his publisher for his two previous books, Simon & Schuster, refused to publish it. It was instead taken on by Vintage. American Pscho was heavily criticised, with several prominent feminists speaking out against it. Ellis also recieved several death threats. In spite of all the negative attention (an probably also because of it) American Phsycho sold excellently.
Ellis's father died in 1992. Instead of finishing his forth novel, Glamorama, in 1993 as promised, he put together a collection of previous short stories and published them as The Informers. Ellis spent eight years working on Glamorama, released in 1998, and some people said living the life it portrays. It was less controvertial than American Psycho, and is in some respects regarded as his best work.

1964-"I've never searched for controversy - it's not something I'm interested in generating."BirthplaceLos Angeles, USEducationBennington College, USOther jobsMusic critic, keyboards player in New Wave bandsDid you know?Less Than Zero was published while he was still a student.Critical verdictHis early, showily empty novellas, in which he spoke (or didn't speak) for one of the many generations X, were superseded by the American Psycho controversy/publicity campaign - fading with time and the interesting critical proposition that the antihero doesn't actually rape and mutilate, he merely thinks about it. With Glamorama - more flat-affect high life, designer labels and disgust, but with the addition of an emotional tone and some narrative pace - his star has risen again.Recommended worksGlamorama, though the force of his satire sometimes overwhelms its object, is the most layered and achieved thing he's written.InfluencesHe admits to Hemingway, Don DeLillo ("our greatest living novelist") and Joan Didion ("I completely ripped her off in Less Than Zero"), and says Ulysses was "the most thrilling thing I've ever read".Now read onOriginally seen as part of the 80s literary bratpack that included Tama Janovitz and Jay McInerney, he shares some territory with Will Self (Ellis finds his work "a little too brainy", but says the man himself is "great fun on a night out").AdaptationsBrat-pack uber-novel Less Than Zero was unsatisfyingly adapted in 1987 with a brat-pack cast; American Psycho (dir Mary Harron) was released in 2000 to mostly positive reviews, with Christian Bale especially lauded for his intelligent performance as Patrick Bateman.Useful links and work onlineWork online· Ellis reads from Glamorama· "I don't even know if there'll be another novel": transcript from ICA talkBackground· Official site

This bestseller is both the life story of a fashion entrepreneur and a guide to female empowerment. The trouble is it's as shallow as a teaspoon. By Helen Lewis
=======================================================
Few living writers have had their first novel published their Junior year in college, their third novel banned, and every single one of their books made into movies.   Only one springs to memory: Bret Easton Ellis.  He's an ordinary man with an extraordinary imagination.  He's had more of a hand in the evolution of  contemporary fiction in the last twenty years than David Foster Wallace, Martin Amis, and Stephen King combined.  Ellis' work has been called moralistic, post-modern, and post-post-modern.  In the tradition of Jonathan Swift, he is a satirist of the highest order, the only difference being that he is reporting on a culture and a time that is much more morally bankrupt than the era of Gulliver. And like De Sade and other dark commentators on moral voids in current society, he's suffered for holding up the mirror. 
          The world his characters inhabit is pampered, rich, depressed, well medicated and devoid of all substance.  His creations walk and talk and drink and screw but never really go anywhere. They go through life in a Lithium, Valium, Thorazine, Xanax or Librium-induced haze, sleeping with any gender, murdering indiscriminately and accumulating vast sums of money effortlessly. They come from wealth and die wealthier. They are Ellis' "beautiful elite", the untouchably glamorous and wealthy.  Heirs, heiresses, rock stars, models, photographers, vampires and the freaks who court them.        
          Another noticeable trait that's a constant in Ellis' books is a vacuum of silence; an uncomfortable sad desolation that the chosen share with each other without being able to express it to each other.  For all their money and glamour and fame, they are unhappy because they've been given everything in a value system that it takes most decades to achieve.  There is no introspection.  No philosophical meanderings.  His characters simply aren't capable and until recently, most of them don't progress.  There is no transformation into a better person or just punishment for the wicked.  Everyone is wicked and the majority of them either get away with it or get gobbled up by those who are even more malicious.        
          Paris Hilton could have just as easily walked straight out of an Ellis novel.  She embodies everything about Ellis' universe; beauty over purpose, money before scruples, and sex at all costs.  Impulse gratification at any expense.  And what is expense when money blows through their lives like the confetti that litters the cosmos in Glamorama?   With six books to date (Less Than Zero, The Rules Of Attraction, American Psycho, The Informers, Glamorama, and Lunar Park)  Brett Easton Ellis has influenced everything from music videos to Gen X nostalgia to making a slasher film look marvelous.        
          Ellis has had plenty of time to research the glamorous life.  He was born on March 7th, 1964 and raised in Los Angeles, California in Sherman Oaks, a division of San Fernando Valley.  His father, Robert Martin Ellis, was a wealthy property developer and an abusive alcoholic who sold skyscrapers. His father physically abused his family and one of Brett's salient child hood memories involved the two of them driving around the Plaza Hotel in New York until the Oak Room bar opened at 10 am, where his father had three drinks and ordered one for his son.  His mother, Dale, was a house wife.  Brett was born into wealth and grew up with two younger sisters in a gabled house with a pool not far from his grammar school. During his teen years his parents enrolled him at  Buckley, a  private school full of rich kids with richer parents who worked in the film industry.  English was the only class he took seriously, and after writing stories from the age of 10, Ellis frequently submitted and published his fiction in Buckley's literary magazine.  In one article, "Writing Of The Grotesque", Ellis lamented that his 'inability to connect worries me'.  After some encouragement, he wrote pop music and film reviews for the school newspaper.        
          In 1978, after his parents found marijuana in his room, they sent Ellis to Nevada to work at one of his grandfather's casinos for the summer. In 1980, his father became very wealthy and began working from home. He was profiled in The Wall Street Journal.  During that time, after being heavily influenced by the simply structured prose of Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises, he wrote his first novel.  In his Junior and Senior years of high school, Ellis wrote two more novels to shake the instinct to be autobiographical in his fiction.  The second novel would later evolve into his first published book Less Than Zero. In 1982, around the time that Ellis graduated, his parents divorced.        
          After graduating from high school, Ellis attended Bennington college, a small university in Vermont with a campus of around 500 people.  Ellis initially enrolled at Bennington to major in music but wound up taking a writing class taught by Joe McGinnis.  He also played keyboards in The Parents, a minor New Wave Band at the time.  They played campus festivals and parties drawing hundreds of party goers. He had girlfriends and boyfriends. His father Robert (who didn't take his writing seriously) wanted him to major in business. When he met published author and professor Joe McGinnis, the teacher was so impressed with his writing samples that he put Ellis in touch with his own literary agent.        
          During the same period, young novelist Donna Tartt transferred to Bennington from the University of Mississippi and became close friends with Bret. It was while she attended Bennington that she began writing The Secret History, a novel about a student who's murdered by his fellow Greek Studies. Bret gave her critical feedback on the book and referred her to his literary agent, aiding in the publishing process.        
Aside from partying with his fellow class mates, Ellis got a taste for writing work shops, building up a thick skin for literary criticism, and a style for first person journalistic prose in the realm of fiction.  He read Ullysess during his college years and frequently notes it as one of the greatest novels ever written.  In 1985, after having his own 530 page giant pared down to 230 pages, Less Than Zero was published (and purchased for $5,000) to great critical and commercial success.  It sold 50,000 copies in it's first year of publication. The media labelled Ellis 'the voice of a generation', and it became a New York Times Best Seller.  He was compared to Truman Capote. It's a book about the transformations (mostly for the worse) that take place in a group of high school friends after they've graduated from high school and reunite for winter break to their homes and their families in California.        
          The publication and overnight success of Less Than Zero gave Ellis a nervous breakdown.  For a period, he didn't leave his dorm room at college.  A rumor circulated that his editor wrote the book and he Ellis was 'too damn scared' to defend himself.  These were the first recurring signs of the author's anxiety issues.  After help from his mother, Ellis began seeing a therapist and regulated his attacks with anti-anxiety medication as well as antidepressants.        
          In 1987, two years later, the film was adapted for the screen and directed by Mark Kanievska starring Andrew McCarthy, Robert Downey Jr.and Jami Gertz.  Coincidentially, the author was good friends with Robert Downey Jr. before the making of the film. Downey played the son of a rich family whose drug abuse became so lavish that it destroyed him. Years later, Ellis was in a hotel room in New York feeding Downey's girlfriend (at the time) Sarah Jessica Parker an alibi for why he couldn't see her while Downey was freebasing cocaine.        
          Ellis was asked if he wanted to be involved in the film making process but he declined in favor of finishing his schooling at Bennington. He was disappointed with the results but the film was a tremendous commercial and critical success. The movie approach was watered down from the book and injected with character motivation that the author never intended for his characters to have.  In the same year, Rules Of Attraction, his second novel, was published by Simon & Schuster.        
          Far from being autobiographical, Ellis' second novel explored the excess, depravity and sexual exploration of a group of college students who barely attend classes and spend their semesters partying and sleeping around with as many people from as many genders as they can.  It was ill-received and panned by critics as being too autobiographical. Rules Of Attraction remains one of Ellis' favorite creations in print and on screen because he feels that American Psycho, Less Than Zero and Glamorama were big enough and successful enough that they 'could take care of themselves', whereas Rules Of Attraction never achieved an audience on par with the author's ambitions.        
After graduating from Bennington and with the money he'd made up to that point from his endeavors, Ellis moved to New York City to take up writing as a career.  He's always taken writing as a structured profession, setting his alarm for a reasonable hour in the morning and putting in eight hours a day writing long hand in a notebook, fleshing out outlines for novels, or entering his hand-written scripts on to a computer.  All of his novels have been written in long hand on paper first and sometimes several times on a typewriter before completing his final manuscripts on his computer.  His third and most successful enterprise, American Psycho, was drafted three times in it's entirety on a typewriter before Ellis submitted the completed book.  Ellis often reads books of poetry while working on a novel as it 'sparks off images or scenes in my head more so than prose does'.  Naming Joan Didion as one of a few major influences in his profession, Ellis looks at paragraphs in his novels aesthetically, breaking up longer paragraphs to improve the experience of reading the book.  Ellis also came to be friends with, and became a part of what was coined 'The Literary Brat Pack', comprised of Ellis, Jay McInerney (Bright Lights, Big City), Jill Eisenstadt (From Rockaway) and Tama Janowitz (Slaves Of New York).  The entire group was successful at first, partying many a night away at Nell's with the rest of the literati at the time; agents, writers, publishers and their significant others. McInerney's novel Bright Lights, Big City was also adapted into a major motion picture starring Michael J. Fox. It was a book about a writer who worked at a crummy job, did a lot of cocaine and pined for his ex-girlfriend/model while his mother slowly died from cancer.  The film was not terribly successful.  After moving to New York, Ellis took in the city and the pace of the times and decided to write a book that captured the essence of the city and the excess of the '80s. He noticed a lot of young wall street guys scurrying around new york and was inspired to write a book about 'hollow money'. Little did he know that it would be an uphill process all the way. In preperation for the novel, Ellis researched by hanging out with wealthy stock brokers at work and after hours at clubs and bars.  While he was tailing them he noticed that they didn't talk much about their jobs, but instead spent their time name dropping, discussing the hottest clubs and restaurants that they got into while spending vast sums of money. In hindsight, this was due to the fact that a lot of the stockbrokers in the '80s were involved in unscrupulous practices involving insider trading. He also called in some favors and gained access to FBI reports and criminology case files on murderers and serial killers so that he could make the portions of the novel where the murders took place more believable. He read about concentration camp atrocities and the Manson family murders for the dialogue and the description of the murder scenes.  Again, this novel was written in first person during a dark emotional time in the author's life, leading him to remark often in interviews that it was his most autobiographical work to date. The book he was working on was American Psycho, a dark satire of Patrick Bateman, a sociopathic stockbroker by day and a serial killer by night.  A character who's only passion came from pop music dissertations on Genesis, The Talking Heads, Whitney Houston and Huey Lewis & The News.  Bateman's anal retentive soliloquies about the designer clothes his friends, lovers and peers wore set a new template for Ellis as a writer. A club hopping, trend setting murderer whose emotionless observations on his co-workers fashion sense and popular music in his generation raised the bar so high in terms of fictional dialogue that Ellis' peers are still racing to catch up. Ellis dedicated the book to high school friend Bruce Taylor, who never read books and infused the author with a sense of humor he believed informed the voice and dimension of Patrick Batemen.  After publishing his first two novels, Simon & Schuster caved in to protests from the National Organization of Women (led by feminist Tammy Bruce) and threats of a boycott at the impending release of American Psycho, two months before the book went to press (an event unheard of in publishing). The author still pocketed a $300,000 advance from Simon & Schuster for the manuscript to the book. Ellis was shocked at the negative and immediate reaction from the publishing company. Thankfully, Alfred E. Knopf picked up the book and published it in 1991 under their Vintage line of trade paperbacks.  The book was gaining publicity and momentum and it hadn't even been released yet.  Critics unilaterally hated it and popular writers like Norman Mailer and John Updike chimed in with their two cents. Mailer (of all people) said that the book's 'legitimate theme needed a greater writer than Bret Easton Ellis to do it". Both did so to grab some limelight for themselves. Ellis received phoned death threats while touring to promote the novel. The Washington Post called it "the literary equivalent of a snuff flick".  The National Organization of Women pushed to ban the book led by Feminist Tara Baxter (who to this day has a web site dedicated to banning all things American Psycho).  After American Psycho's release, Baxter was arrested for reading excerpts from the book at a B. Dalton's bookstore. The stunt was aired on the nightly news and made the front page of every newspaper in Santa Cruz, California the next day.  For a woman who was so fervently against violence towards women, or even the depiction of such in a work of fiction, she had this to say about the author: 
         After her jail time and court date, Baxter went around California and poured blood on 27 copies of the novel at every book store she could reach.  The book steadily made a great deal of money. Ellis received death threats by mail.  Rumors circulated that the author had taken the excerpts from the journal of an actual serial killer. And the book continued to sell well. Despite all the negative hype, militant protests and pot shots from his peers, Ellis beared no ill will regarding his intentions for writing the book and the public's perception of it.  In an interview with Jaime Clarke, he had this to say about his most notorious character:  -I'm (also) a believer that Patrick Bateman can exist at anytime. Patrick 
  We notice it more often. It makes more of an impact on us.-  In 1992, a year after the release of American Psycho, Ellis' father passed away and he took a year off from his next project to cope with the loss and settle his affairs.  Ellis' father surprisingly left behind a debt of ten million dollars.  He was an aficionado of bad art and spent millions on a single artist's collection.  Bret says that he's reminded of his father every time he looks in the mirror.  After coming to terms with the loss, he continued toiling away on his first book with an intentional story arc.  A novel that would take him nine years in it's entirety to complete.  A story told in three acts with a character progression. In it's inception, Bret Easton Ellis only had one plan that he was certain of.  The novel would start with the word 'specks' and end with the word 'mountains'.  The rest was left to long hand, outlines, character profiles and charts.  Ellis originally had a deadline in 1993 for Glamorama, his magnum opus, but he hadn't completed it.  At heart the book was a conspiracy, and the conspiracy kept getting bigger.  Ellis kept a flow chart and the branches and off-shoots of the conspiracy kept spiraling out of control.  Between a death in the family and the insistence of character's voices gone by, Ellis spent a weekend at a friend's beach house finishing a collection of short stories when he'd planned on finishing Glamorama.  It was an idle pet project that he went to when he needed a break from writing novels, or when he wanted to flesh out character voices in separate stories.  A compendium of Ellis alumni in the periphery of his novels.  Like Director Kevin Smith (Clerks, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back), Ellis' characters make repeat visits and walk-ons in his books.  During a spat with author Jay McInerney, Ellis even introduced Allison Poole (Story of My Life), one of McInerney's characters to Patrick Bateman in one of his books to get back at him.  In an attempt to please his publishers and make deadline (although it wasn't the project they were expecting), he sent them The Informers, a collection of short stories he worked on and freelanced to various magazines from 1983 to 1994 about first person character accounts from a group of people living in L.A.  While it wasn't what they were expecting, Vintage was pleased and decided to take it to press. 
The collection covers stories that were published in magazines over the years when he was trying to make ends meet to stories that he wrote and rebuffed from college.  Teenagers from LA as vampires.  Rock stars in Japan who do unspeakable things to hotel rooms and the groupies inside of them.  An awkward vacation with a father and son in Hawaii.  It was released in 1994 from Vintage with little to no fanfare.  The author went on his first American book tour to promote the collection. The hype was beginning to subside.  
   Not a whole lot is known about Ellis' activities from 1995-1998 (when Glamorama was released), other than the fact that he did a lot of club hopping and attended numerous fashion shows in Milan, New York, and Paris to research Glamorama.  During this decade, Ellis developed a heroin addiction and coped with the emotional fallout of a seven year relationship.  He frittered away much of his royalties buying drinks and picking up tabs for friends and well wishers while he was out clubbing.  Ellis worked on Glamorama from the age of 26 to 34. Critics took shots at the author by saying that Glamorama satirized a lifestyle that Ellis himself led. Well into his mid-30s, Ellis was also working on his memoirs. Another side project (the unfortunate working title of which was Where I Have Been I Would Not Go Back) that he wasn't sure if he would publish or keep for himself.  Either because of the amount of time that had elapsed since American Psycho or thanks to the desensitization of the culture, Glamorama was received with less controversy and less public outrage.  At heart, it's a novel about a model/club owner/actor who gets pulled into a terrorist organization run by..models.  In the same extremes whereby a stock broker can become a serial killer, Ellis took the fashion world and equated it with terrorism, because models are 'used to standing around all day and taking orders'. In his inimitable literary fashion, Ellis took a moral stance on the toxic nature of beauty and fashion. When approached about the industry during an interview, he had this to say: 'This obsession with looks that the fashion and photography worlds have taken to an extreme, psychically damages the culture. Period. That's a fact.'
   Unlike any other creative project leading up to Glamorama, the book has a definitive beginning and end. It's split up into two halves; one in which Victor Ward (the main character and a bit player from The Rules Of Attraction) opens a club and launches his career, and another in which he travels abroad to escape certain danger only to get wrapped up in the carnage of political terrorism. Throughout the novel, Ward's obsession with any and all celebrity and his religion of supermodel minutiae slowly drive him to the point of psychosis. The character, in a progression, is barely redeemed by novel's end.  Glamorama was a commercial success and was once again nit-picked by critics. Vintage released it during a publishing schedule that the company normally reserved for popular fiction novelist Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park, Eaters Of The Dead). The finely detailed 'laundry list' of celebrity names fired off like a who's who in '90s glitterati every other paragraph was panned. Ellis had this to say about his first traditional novel in an interview with Christopher Lawrence: 
 -I changed a lot because I wrote this book and because I finished this book.  A lot of things changed for me -- certain fears, certain insecurities were alleviated, not necessarily by the book's subject matter, but just because I wrote the book I never thought I would finish. There was a sense of accomplishment that . . . fixed me in some way.-
   Ellis intended for it to be something of a sequel to American Psycho, which was in the works as a film.  The world wasn't done with Ellis' bastard child yet.  Johnny Depp originally expressed an interest in a film adaptation of the novel dating back to 1992. Tom Cruise was also interested in the film at some point. Director Mary Harron (I Shot Andy Warhol) took the helm and Christian Bale was set to play the lead as Patrick Batemen.  Leonardo Dicaprio took an interest in playing the lead after Lion's Gate Films sent him a copy of the script with an offer for $20 million.  Coasting on the success of Titanic, he had a small list of directors that he would work with including Martin Scorcese and Danny Boyle. Harron had to fight the studio to get Bale (who's friends advised him that taking the role would be 'career suicide') as the lead.  When she put her foot down on having Bale play Bateman, Lion's Gate dropped her from the project.  Other directors attached to American Psycho were: Stanley Kubrick, David Chronenberg, and Jonathan Demme.  After learning that the book was being adapted, famous feminist Gloria Steinheim spearheaded a protest to stop it.  Oliver Stone was became interested in the film and Cameron Diaz was attached as an actress to the project.  Stone began re-writing Harron's script immediately.  DiCaprio and Stone couldn't come to terms on where they wanted the film to go, so Leo dropped the project to make The Beach, directed by Danny Boyle.  Christian Bale (who passed on projects for nine months in order to land the lead) and Harron quietly waited and spoke on the phone during their exile from the film. From a political standpoint, Lion's Gate needed a female director to avoid massive protests.  The company agreed to give her the film back under the condition that the production didn't exceed ten million dollars and that she cast recognizable talent.  It was filmed in Canada in 1998 for the reasonable sum of four million dollars. During production, a Canadian group called Concerned Canadians Against Violence In Entertainment protested the film. They had to use European beauty products in the film because American designers and beauty manufacturers didn't want their product placed in the context of the story.  The hype was so enormous before the film's release that movie tickets were scalped at The Sundance Film Festival for $200 a piece.  American Psycho (2000) was a hit in theaters by accounting standards, making six million it's first weekend.  The film adaptation (written by Harron and Guinevere Turner and starring Christian Bale, Reese Witherspoon, Jared Leto, Chloe Sevigny and Willem Defoe) watered down some of the book's more grisly scenes and relied heavily on the satirical slant of the novel. Ellis had written a screenplay that was rejected because it was 'heavily pornographic and ended with a musical number'.  Hiring 46 year old Harron to direct was a stroke of genius. She conveyed a stronger sense of disorientation in the film, lending credence to a working theory from the end of the novel that all of the events took place in Patrick Batemen's mind.  This was a brilliant "get out of jail free" card.  Bale's portrayal as Batemen was inspired and career-making. The film became a cult phenomenon, grossing millions of dollars in rental and video sales.  Lion's Gate Films was so pleased with the return on their investment that they bought the rights from Ellis to make multiple sequels.  The company initially planned to film a series of Bateman's exploits. Ellis publicly stated that he wanted nothing to do with future sequels, so Lions Gate decided to take their franchise in a different direction by making a sequel about one of Bateman's surviving victims.  American Psycho II: All American Girl (2002) went direct to video and was a resounding flop, nixing any plans for additional sequels.  On June 21st, 2005, a 'killer director's cut' of American Psycho was released by Lion's Gate Entertainment with additional commentaries from Ellis and Mary Harron, deleted scenes, on-set interviews with the cast and crew. The film continues to gain a cult following in video and DVD sales and rentals.  During the same period, a documentary was filmed about the author (and his views on the novels), This Is Not An Exit: The Fictional World Of Bret Easton Ellis (2001).  The documentary interlaced interviews with the author with responses from fellow colleagues like Jay McInerney panning some of his writings, as well as scenes from his novels acted out. The documentary had little to no impact financially or critically.  At best, it's a mediocrity that exposes almost nothing about Ellis' personal life.  Fox added no credits to Ellis' friends and colleagues who shared their views on his life and work.  One of the few redeeming qualities of the film is in the final ten minutes, where Ellis and two of his friends share a drunken conversation in the back of a limo between clubs where a woman makes a flippant remark about Bret enjoying the act of fisting.  This fueled the controversy behind the author's sexuality at the time, which he's never taken a definitive position on.  This can be attributed to the fact that Ellis is bisexual.  At the same time, in the wake of September 11th, Ellis was contacted to contribute a piece in memoriam.  He said that he was 'too depressed to make phrases'.  Hot on the heels of the success of the film version of American Psycho, Lions Gate released The Rules Of Attraction in 2002.  The screenplay was written and directed by Roger Avery (Killing Zoe), and this was the first film that Ellis felt was true to one of his novels.  Starring James Van Der Beek, Jennifer Beals, Shannon Sossamon, Kip Pardue, Fred Savage and Eric Stoltz, it's a case study in attention deficit disorder.  With high production values and a modern soundtrack mixed by Tomandandy, the direction used every film gimmick in the book, from back-masking to split screens to slow motion scenes for the sake of them. The film gave the high profile teen idols a chance to sully their image and performed modestly at the box office.  While filming character Victor Ward's (the main character in Glamorama) trip to Europe with a three person crew and two mini DV camcorders, the director ended up with 70 tapes worth of footage.  Comprising one of only two scenes shot off campus, actor Kip Pardue spent the entire trip in-character, meeting celebrities such as Paul Oakenfold, giving an interview to The Guardian as Victor Ward and filming actual people into the montage.  The five minute sequence in The Rules Of Attraction had turned into an opportunity.  Avary was so inspired by the footage that he purchased the rights to Glamorama with the intention of bringing Kip Pardue back in the main role as Victor. The target date for the film is January of 2007.   Rose McGowan and Shannon Doherty are rumored to have signed on for the project.  The core footage that was shot during the trip is being edited for possible release as a documentary bridging the gap between The Rules Of Attraction and Glamorama.  The working title is Glitterati. 
 After a six year silence, Ellis is releasing his latest novel, Lunar Park, in August of 2005 with Vintage.  The writer started the project in 1989 as an homage to horror novels that he grew up reading, most notably Stephen King's.  It's an autobiographical book in the style of Adaptation with a guest appearance by Patrick Bateman and Jay McInerney.  It's also a ghost story of sorts and a murder mystery about a group of boys who go missing in suburbia.  Terby, a bird-doll belonging to his step-daughter, comes to life.  Ellis receives strange emails from the bank where his father's ashes are deposited.  Ellis applies satire to his own identity as his character in the book marries a model/actress after the death of his father, moves to suburbia, raises two children and copes with a macabre apocolypse that rains down on their home.  Ashen footsteps appear daily in his living room.  The furniture rearranges itself to match the design scheme from his childhood home.  His father's swimming trunks appear by the pool soaking wet, as if someone just went for a swim.  And the paint on the outside of the home peels away to reveal the color of the house he grew up in.  Strange ghouls scuttle out of the woods and attack the author and his fictitious family and a novelty gravestone purchased for a Halloween party transforms into his dead father's.  A student on campus who keeps popping up in random places as characters from his novels murders the girl he has a crush for in an act of unspeakable maliciousness in a desolate motel room. 
"Every word is true," but a writer's life, Ellis proclaims, is "a maelstrom of lying."  At heart, the book revolves around the relationship between father and son, a theme the author has meditated upon a number of times with powerful results.  He insists that it's 'up to the reader' to decide how much of the novel is based on fact and what amount is purely fiction.  The author continues to craft his talents towards the style of first person fictional journalism he's been practicing since Bennington.  Early reviews have been positive, so it's possible that the critics might be kind to this novel.  The audio version of the book is read by James Van Der Beek. 
Donna Tartt released a second novel, The Little Friend (also from Vintage) in 2002.  Ellis has never disclosed in interviews what the nature of their relationship is or was.  New York peer Jay McInerney has faded into obscurity.  His last novel, Model Behavior, was barely successful.  Interviewer Jaime Clarke (who published one of the most comprehensive interviews with the author to date, spanning two sessions over a ten year period) has written Vernon Downs, a novel about a writer obsessed with Bret Easton Ellis.  It has yet to see publication.  
     Victor Ward, Patrick Bateman, and Jayne Dennis (all characters from Ellis' novels) have taken on lives of their own on the internet.  They have fan sites, as well as Friendster and Myspace profiles and fake publicity releases.  The author's fan sites are legion, and his acolytes and numerous fans refer to him in correspondence simply and intimately by his initials:  bee.  Ellis' novels continue to sell well, although his books sell better abroad than they do in the US.  The book American Psycho continues to sell over 1,000 copies a month.  Bret Easton Ellis is currently trying his hand at screenplay writing with an adaptation of Adam Davies' debut novel, The Frog King, about a womanizing alcoholic in the publishing world who finds the love of his life.  It's been compared to High Fidelity meets Bright Lights, Big City.  Joshua Jackson (Dawson's Creek) is attached as the lead at the time of this writing.  Ellis has also written a script for Molly Jong-Fast's debut novel, Normal Girl. Stylistically, her prose has been compared to Ellis. The novel approaches the drug-induced socializing of a Jewish American Princess among the art and party scene in New York.  The author has a strong pedigree and the subject matter is distinctly Ellis-esque, so one hopes that the script will see the light of day. As for the novels that haven't made it to the silver screen, Nicholas Jarecki (The Outsider) currently has plans to adapt The Informers into a major motion picture.  How that will translate as a cohesive short story collection remains to be seen.  Ellis' life and novels remain scandalous, meticulous and painstakingly crafted.  He continues to live in a loft in New York in a building that used to be a former felt factory, splitting his time between New York and LA (during the winter).  He moved into his apartment when he originally moved to New York in 1987, and it's most notable for it's high book shelves full of foreign editions and other translations of his own novels, vaulted ceilings and bottles of liquor lining his kitchen counter where most people place their everyday appliances.  He keeps a poster for the film adaptation of Less Than Zero over his toilet.  In recent interviews, Ellis has spoken of working on a novel set in Washington that's 'tangentially related to politics'.  The world hasn't heard the last of Bret Easton Ellis, although the stigma and the well-spring of fame caused by American Psycho have left an indeliable mark on his career that will be difficult to trump. One only hopes and anticipates that he's more than capable of the assignment.

The great Bret Easton Ellis on sex, drugs, being gay, clothes, skin disease, the casting couch, American Psycho and Imperial Bedrooms.
Bret Easton Ellis is sitting behind his desk in the living room of his two room suite at London’s Claridges hotel. He is looking at his iPhone which he is holding sideways and pointing at his laptop. He is dressed in a grey James Perse hoody, blue nylon Nike tracksuit bottoms and some running shoes, when he walks about the top of his black underwear is on show.
The cocaine remnants from the night before have been cleaned from the glass tables and the two people who ended the night fucking in front of him on his small settee have long gone.
In his bathroom his grooming products and vitamins are arranged like a tool kit. In the hall are two copies of his new novel ‘Imperial Bedrooms.’ The sleeve is the silhouette of a horned figure with the two words of the title for eyes.
We sit down and have a conversation which was planned for half an hour but stretches to nearly two. We talk about books, sex, writing, therapy, glamour, the casting couch, New York, LA, skin disease, clothes, children, happiness, editing, fucking, pornography, being gay and more.
He seems very happy, upbeat, he moves his legs about a lot whilst we’re talking. This is pretty much the full conversation.
But first something about Bret Easton Ellis and his books. His work has inspired millions of column inches and provoked masses of debate. Some people hate him, more people love him. His career has felt more like that of a popular musician than a novelist. His work is both disposable yet lasting. Like no other contemporary novelist he is of his time – he characterises the influence brands, fame and crime have on modern society. He writes about distasteful subjects that people will joke and confer about in mutters and asides and he does it in the mainstream. He does not do it under the guise of art or cutting edge literature. He does right out there in the glare of the retail world.
He made his name with the two slim volumes about the disposable decadence of the people he grew up with in Los Angeles. Less Than Zero and Rules of Attraction captured the self-importance, the drama, the drugs and pointlessness of the young Hollywood elite in a way that later become a staple for television. In particular MTV, which he was believed to have reflected – ‘the MTV generation’ the critics called his subjects and his readers, have steadily eroded the idea of Music as their core programming and replaced it with the sort of docudrama that is a more clean living but equally vacuous descendent of the characters in Less Than Zero.
Having made his name as a sort of Scot Fitzgerald in Raybans he then destroyed it by giving the world Patrick Bateman in the super-vilified American Psycho. Bateman is a bland brand-loving banker who places great importance on the quality of business cards and the musical output of soft rockers, a Wall Street wonder boy who also happens to be a sadistic serial killer. The passages in which Bateman brings rats, hookers, chainsaws into sex play shocked the literary world, newspaper critics, decent folk and feminists across the western world. The book caused a genuine scandal and gave Easton Ellis an infamy that it had become almost impossible to attain with the printed word. Whilst his contemporaries were competing with each other Easton Ellis appeared to be duelling with Caravaggio. A pretentious claim I know but there’s a doc on about him as I write so excuse the comparison.
Unfortunately for his detractors just as the nihilistic outlook of Hollywood brats had struck a chord with a generation, so American Psycho provided sexual titillation for a generation made increasingly depraved by access to pornography. To others it appeared like a sharp satire of a world where appearance and alpha male bullshit are king.
The common mistake in reacting to his work seems to have been in presuming that because Easton Ellis can represent the worlds he portrays so accurately he somehow approves of them. The opposite is in fact the case.
His fifth novel (there had been a third Glamorama between Rules of Attraction and Psycho but it was difficult to finish – third album syndrome – he tells me it took him eight years to write) Lunar Park lacked the easy outrage of its predecessors but to my mind is his best book. Whereas his previous novels had turned a spotlight on the validity of his life, Lunar Park used the genre of horror for the author to go back over his literary life so far and examine it. The central character is a writer called Bret Easton Ellis. Characters from the real Bret Easton Ellis’ novels appear as ghosts. Most significantly though the book carried Bret’s own interpretation of what and who American Psycho is about, specifically he claimed the loveless view of life of the sociopath Bateman was actually modelled on the personality of his own father. Whilst the first half of the book carried some genuinely terrifying passages, the second half of the book was like a love letter to a man he couldn’t love.
If you have read American Psycho but not Lunar Park it’s a little like watching the first Mesrine film without seeing the second. It is a better book and Bret Easton Ellis delivers a different level of writing. There is less artifice, more honesty, more personal horror.
And now he has returned with another slim volume about the life of some of the characters of his first two books, Imperial Bedrooms. Twenty five years on where are they? They are Still in Hollywood, still self-obsessed and still trapped by sex and identity. And doused in he co-dependent despair that comes with the belief that too much of the first is what will give them the second. The book has splashes of fear, horror, banality, sex, violence all carried out beneath the bright LA sun.
B: Right. You stop saying no, start saying yes. It’s ok it would have been fine if I didn’t have to do like a two and a half hour signing at Waterstones. What is it with so much blow and the drinking?
J: It’s because we’re an island, there’s nowhere to go other than inside. In the US you can move from the West Coast to the East or the East to the West, here you can’t. We’re surrounded by water and that affects our expectations of what we’ve got and it gives us limitations, so everyone gets fucked up. There’s a smaller version of it in Iceland and Ireland and places like that. I noticed on your Twitter feed that an American magazine has graded all your books.
B: Yeah, Entertainment Weekly. At the end of their reviews they give a grade, it’s what that magazine is known for. They do it for movies, records, books, video games, whatever.
B: I wouldn’t. I don’t grade my books. The books are the best thing I’d written at a particular time of my life, it’s really interesting. I don’t rate them, I don’t stack them up against each other, I don’t compete with them, I don’t feel I have to outdo them, I just write the book I feel like writing at the time that I write the book.
B: Ok, I am happy when I’m writing the book, but that’s not an all day thing, that’s two hours sometimes, three hours, where you’re transported by the work and you’re into it, and the weight of the world is gone – your sorrows, your pains, they kinda disappear because you’re concentrating on the work. I suppose it’s how work is for a lot of people, you just work, you just lose yourself in your work, and kinda everything goes away. But definitely, the novels come from a place of pain and stress, they don’t come from a place of joy and happiness.
J: To me your latest book is set in a world where the parents of that world are Tom Ford and Charles Manson. That’s the moral parentage.
J: This is what you’ve repeatedly identified in your writing, that we live in an era where fame, crime and brands are king. And that’s where these people exist. You have said that you don’t like your characters…
B: Hmmm, I’m more empathic to them than I… look, when I was younger and talking about my work, I tried to talk about it in very literary terms, and I tried to make very defiant statements about my purpose and my intent as a novelist. (whispers) ‘As a novelist. As a young and important American novelist. Often, I believed what I said.‘ I did. There were times when I had no idea or inkling of the bullshit that was coming out of my mouth, and the kind of answers I thought people wanted from me – I gave them, even if I didn’t find them to be particularly authentic. All of this is a preamble in a way, I suppose, of saying for example now I talk about… Patrick Bateman was me. I was Patrick Bateman…
B: Yeah I admit it now. I never admitted it the first 10, 15 years after publication of that book, I was very defensive about it, but I was writing about myself.
B: My father a little bit but I was living that lifestyle, my father wasn’t in New York the same age as Patrick Bateman, living in the same building, going to the same places that Patrick Bateman was going to – I was, I was doing all of that stuff. Now of course you want to write a novel, you’re a novelist and I’m not going to publish my journals, and writing about myself was not going to be particularly interesting. But the impetus to write that book came out of my lifestyle and how unhappy it made me, and how the idea of becoming an adult seemed frustrating, absurd, disgusting, and I was kind of enraged, and that’s how American Psycho started, that was the genesis of it.
So if you’re going to ask me if I’m ever going to write about someone I like… I kind of like Patrick Bateman and I kind of like Victor Ward, and I kind of like the Bret Easton Ellis character. I like some of the kids in Rules of Attraction and Clay I have empathy for. I don’t know. Actually you might look at this depraved cast of characters and go ‘my God, what are you talking about?’ but out of the narrators, I have to like the narrators in order to write them. I finally have discovered this – I have to like them.
J: What was it about your dad that prompted you to say in Lunar Park that he was the model for Bateman? Why did you do that? Because I thought that was the best thing you’ve ever written – the revelation.
B: Yes. Definitely. Patrick Bateman was based on my father as well and based on men that I had met and a certain type of man and I wanted him to embody also, which I didn’t particularly embody, this new thing that was emerging in society – metrosexuality, that nobody seemed to be dealing with in fiction in ’91. And I saw this thing happening and I thought it was interesting, and it was – I don’t want to say the dandification of men – but definitely men seeing themselves in this way they hadn’t seen themselves before, almost like girls used to. So yeah, he was a bunch of different things, but primarily it started with me and then of course yes, he becomes emblematic of something that was gnawing at me, but it was also… I mean, writing that book was also a way of transporting myself out of that life I was living, you know, I bought into a lot of that shit. You know, I write American Psycho and I say ‘it’s a very hard take on those times’, and yeah maybe it is, but I primarily saw it as something…
B: Yeah, you’re right, it was pretty hard. But then in Lunar Park, the Bret Easton Ellis in Lunar Park is not me, it’s really not me. And the people who don’t like Lunar Park because they think part of it is an apology for American Psycho, and there are people who don’t like it – there are fans of American Psycho who don’t like it because they think it’s an apology for American Psycho – I’ve gotten that a lot.
J: That’s a book about being an adult and having some reflection. I thought it was brilliant, I thought it was better than American Psycho.
J: In your new book Clay is in the gripped by severe co-dependence. That passage at the end when you write about the need to be rejected, is any of that real to you, personal?
J: I mean you could have been transcribing conversations with a therapist for some of the personal examination that the narrator [Bret laughs], it’s really intense, and for you to have plucked that out from somewhere other than yourself, and then projecting it onto that character or giving that character that outlook – that’s quite a big lift. So what I’m saying is how much of that is you?
J: But it’s so savage, it’s so savage that he falls into that co-dependency – to him that relationship is lasting forever, but I think at one point she says ‘I’ve only been going out with you for five days!’
B: Look, that may be how I can feel at times, but overall I’m not like that. And personally I find the casting couch in LA funny, it’s funny, it’s the best part about LA.
B: The self-examination (laughs) yeah that’s bigt ime and it is me, but a lot of it is, I have issues with myself, ok?
B: I had a therapist in LA, because the first three years when I moved back – in ‘06 – were pretty fucking horrible. They were fucking horrible. Personal, professional, everything collided. It was a perfect storm of personal stuff and professional stuff exploding into a massive storm.
B: Probably from something within me. You’re talking about the co-dependency he has with these actresses, he shacks up with briefly and then has this explosion.
J: Yeah this need for them. He needs those women like Patrick Bateman needs that pen, or whatever he was fetishising, doesn’t he? The suit, or the pen, or the album…
I had a therapist in LA, because the first three years when I moved back – in ‘06 – were pretty fucking horrible. They were fucking horrible. Personal, professional, everything collided. It was a perfect storm of personal stuff and professional stuff exploding into a massive storm.
B: Izod. I like the ones with the little alligator on them, you know those right? I like those a lot. But I love James Perse, and I love his tshirts and these hoodies, and they make me feel good. Though I have not bought clothes in the longest time. I don’t remember the last time I wore a… the last time I wore a suit in LA was to go to the premier of The Informers (laughs).
B: I don’t wear suits any more, and in fact for this GQ thing that was… whatever this thing was sponsored by last night, book launch, at this place called Marks or something I don’t know. They sent over a suit, so I would wear a suit to this thing. But I am so not interested in clothes at the moment, I wear sweats. I prefer sweatpants and Lacostes and I walk around in sandals in LA… I’m barefoot most of the time.
B: I like going to the movies, I like having sex, I like going to museums now, galleries, I like reading… I like to hike.
B: Drink. I think I probably drink too much. At least something that I worry about sometimes, not really enough to do anything about it, but drugs are gone, not interested in drugs at all any more.
J: I haven’t had any drugs for 12 years, since I was the editor of GQ, and when I was reading the passage in Imperial Bedrooms when Clay goes to the parties, it weirdly made me want to have sex and take drugs…
J: Yeah but I don’t often get that, because I have a very clear memory of what it ended up like, for quite a long time…
J: Well the first time I realised I might have a problem was when I just… you realise you always want to go somewhere where there’s a possibility of having sex.
J: Not if you like doing it. But what I realised was, I had sex with a lot of people that I didn’t like having sex with, and it was the point of doing it, rather than enjoying it. It was wanting it, and wanting to get it.
B: I’m very good at just doing it with one person, I’m totally fine with that. In fact that’s what I’m looking for while I’m having sex with other people, is to find that person that I want to have sex with. It’s hard enough to find that person who you actually like having sex with. And I think when you find that person, just lock it down.
J: Ah yeah, it was giving me… but I don’t often get that at all. I don’t have any hankering… sometimes heroin, because I didn’t do that a lot and I liked doing that, snorting it with coke…
J: It made my nose twitch like the rabbit in Bewitched. But you write about it in a way that it makes it sound attractive. Having said I also identified with the scenes like when he goes to the club, he goes ‘what am I doing here? I’m like 15 years too old to be in this club’. Clay not wanting to be there, and not knowing why he was there.
J: Yeah… or device. I liked the French page in Rules of Attraction, I thought that was brilliant, do you remember that?
B: No I get sad for… no it’s not sadness, it’s sort of a yearning feeling I guess, but I don’t know, you seem real, and enthusiastic about these books of mine.
J: Yeah but you know what you’ve done? There’s no need to feel sad about it, I think you write in a pop way. Your books are like pop music. I don’t mean that in a negative way…
J: When I read your book this week, I was just engrossed. All night, next morning, finished, done. And it felt like being in a great club dancing to a great record. Now in years to come you might not remember dancing to that record but you know it’s a good record.
J: And that’s what I think you’ve got in your books. Some people you read their books and you know they’re trying to compete with history. You know they’re trying to write against a book that somebody wrote 30 years ago, and it weighs them down.
J: And your books are of a time, and it’s not just a little snapshot of time it’s how we are now. do you think you write about people, a time or America?
B: I think I write about myself. People – I don’t know what that means. America – well I’m American so automatically that comes into play, and what was it, people America and…
B: Yeah I guess because I set the books in the time that I’m around, yeah so I automatically all those things are true, but I think I’m writing basically about myself. I think every narrator I’ve ever created is a version of me or a fantasy I have about myself, whether it’s a good fantasy or a bad fantasy, whether my self esteem is low or high or whatever. But that’s where the books come from. But I want to get back to that question you had, now how do you do this on your site? Do you do Q&A or do you write…
B: So, this is all on the record by the way, you can transcribe this… I was gonna talk about, I’ve had… every few years I have a bout of psoriasis, do you know what psoriasis is?
B: Yeah, there’s nothing to do about it, but my dermatologist said there was a great new cream on the market, I said ‘are you kidding me?’, she says ‘it’s about 600 bucks a tube, I can get you some…’ so I said you know, I’ve had it all my life and nothing has really ever worked, I get a flare up once every three years or so, and it’s caused by stress… we have enough time to talk about this stuff don’t we? She’s gonna come by in about 45 minutes, and I do just wanna talk about this because it’s on my mind right now. And I said ‘but nothing works, nothing has worked for 20 years – 30 years nothing’s worked’, and she said ‘I know, I know, but this cream really works.’ And so, she’s right, and it has worked. But I got it because of stress, I’d just began the US tour…
B: The last month. And it was about three days into the US tour, extremely stressful in terms of huge crowds, a lot of pressure, a lot of flying around, a lot of just dealing with shit. And I woke up one morning after a very intense night and yeah. Right, so I wanna go back to that thing about favourite passages, I wanna think about it and I wanna talk about it.
There are a couple of passages, I like a story in The Informers a lot, it’s about four or five pages long, and if you had to ask me what is the thing I like the most – I think this maybe is the best thing. I like this story it’s called On the Beach and it’s near the end of the book it’s about five pages long, it’s about a guy who’s talking about his girlfriend who’s dying, and he’s you know, she just lays on the beach all day and she’s dying, and there’s like hanger-onners in the house in Malibu and he’s talking about how because she’s dying he’s gonna leave her. I like that story, I don’t know why. And it’s the last story I’ve ever written also, er…
B: So are you going to ring me up when you get here? I’ll come down in my little suit, my little suit…
Bret: I like er, I don’t know, sometimes I think American Psycho is earnest. Sometimes, but not all the time, sometimes I think it’s earnest, and there are passages in it that I like a lot, but I think they’re a little bit too artist. I love much of Glamorama, for some reason, many people don’t yeah. I like a lot of little…I like that opening chapter of Lunar Park a lot, it was fun to write. Took a lot of time to write, but was fun to write.
J: In Lunar Park the monster is called Terby, which you reveal to be ‘why Bret’ backwards, why did you deliberately reverse that?
B: Well, yeah. I wanted to do a little thing on ‘redrum’, from The Shining, I wanted to write a Stephen King book. I remember how that happens, like at the end of part one or part two of The Shining, about 150 pages in – ‘redrum, redrum, redrum’, and then you realise at the end of part two it’s murder – and it’s just this moment when I was a child reading that book and it was just like ‘THAT’S COOL!’ – and I wanted to do the same thing in that, (laughs) I mean I don’t know, I don’t know.
J: You said you’ve never compared your books to other books you’ve written, have you read any books that you’ve thought ‘oh, that’s almost as good as me’ or ‘I better watch myself there’?
B: I read books all the time that I think are better than mine. I don’t have a lot of confidence in myself as a writer by the way.
B: I don’t. And I’ve got self esteem issues about my work and about… I dunno. And I try not to think about it too much, I only really talk about it when I’m doing tour, like in situations like this. During the five years that I’m either working on a book or I’m just hanging out, I never have conversations like this with my friends, I really don’t. And especially since I’ve stopped doing drugs I don’t have these conversations. I think right now, David Mitchell – Ghostwritten, the first book, regardless of what you think, it’s really well written, he’s a really good writer. He knows how to write, it grips you. I have got to a point in my life now where I toss books away after two pages. I get it, the writer can’t write, I’m not interested in his line of bullshit, I don’t want to sit with 400 pages of his fucking made up characters and his fucking stupid story and I toss it away. But if I open a page and the writing is really good, I don’t give a shit what the story can beabout – it can be about a 20 year old college girl in Wisconsin, but if the writing’s good – I’m there. But I used to read ok books all the time, I used to read four ok books a week, I can’t do it any more – I just have to read good books.
B: I did. I cried at the end when they find the girl. I was sobbing, really good. They find her and you think she’s probably dead, but she’s not – she’s alive.
B: You know it’s interesting, I was at my book launch party in LA, Andrew Garfield was there, the journalist [from the film], I went up to him…he’s also the new Spiderman, who also looks about 12 in person… he looked a bit of a man in Red Riding Trilogy, odd. I’ve got a little thing for him, thought he was attractive. Anyway I’m digressing, or maybe I’m not. But I told someone the next day, ‘oh yeah, I met Andrew Garfield and told him how much I loved the Red Riding Trilogy’, and this person who knows Andrew says ‘oh, why did you say that, he hated working on that movie, that movie was a nightmare for him, he really had an awful time and he doesn’t like it’. But I haven’t figured out why.
You know what, it’s very telling that where I am now at this point in my life that, that was your question and instead I talked about the star of the movie at a party at the Chateau, and how maybe I found him attractive. I think there was a time when I would have engaged, or forced myself to engage, in a way like ‘oh yes, the books, there were four of them right? And they only made three of them into a movie…’ I’m not worried about it, but I’m always aware of… yes, you’re always aware of it. I don’t know. I’ve found myself in a strange place where… no, not a strange place but a place where I… I don’t know. I’m not, I can’t effect the literary pretentions any more that I kind of used to drift towards.
B: Screen writers, but no novelists. I’m out in Hollywood now, I’m out in Hollywood. I like it. I like it. I prefer it to New York.
B: (pauses) Rules of Attraction. Oddly enough, oddly enough, on Amazon in the States, by far the most popular of my books.
B: Yes. I do. Even if it is my probably, I mean I went out on this… I began it when I was at college, finished it the year that I graduated. You know I wanted to do stream of consciousness shit and I found these people maybe more interesting and I don’t know, anyway, it’s not like… I can talk about my books and I don’t really rate them against each other but I kind of look at Rules of Attraction as yeah, ok, that was the gap between Less Than Zero and American Psycho, and I understand I had to write it at the time as it meant a lot to me, and I’m still glad I did.I think the reason it has four stars is because it is the one book that most people can identify with.
J: When you boil everything down and you edit all your research and your outlines down, do you mourn any thing that you chuck out?
B: Oh totally. I do mourn, and it was happening a lot in Imperial Bedrooms because I realised he was not going to notice a lot of this shit, and there was a scene in a restaurant where, and it’s a restaurant that I frequent, and it’s got this beautiful silver wall at the back of the restaurant, shimmering as the light changes during the day, the wall becomes candescent. I thought oh great, the scene – the actress is going to be sitting in that restaurant, and good, I’m going to do a little bit here and then I’m going to go to description of that wall. And then I wrote it and I thought it was great, I thought those four lines were fucking poetry. Read it… fuck! Clay would never notice this, he would not spend four lines talking about that fucking wall, that is you jerking off, that is you stroking yourself, that is you not paying attention to this character and this narrator and what he would notice and what he would not notice – remove it immediately! It happened a lot in American Psycho too, that I thought was like, I don’t know, very beautiful and lyrical and ‘oh what a cool metaphor that would be’, and then I’ll put it in and go ‘what? This is not going to go there. He’s not going to notice that.’ And I’ve been taken to task for this before. I’ve been taken to task by Mailer on this, he said my problem as a writer, and he was talking about American Psycho, and I don’t agree with it but, ‘Bret Easton Ellis’ problem as a writer is that he stays so true to his narrator that he doesn’t let the novelist in’. Now I don’t agree with that I think it’s old school thinking, but he said like, I give the novel to Patrick Bateman – it’s his book. Clay get’s his book, Clay, if he’s a narrator, he has to feel authentic to me and if that feel that it means cutting out shit that I think is really good writing then I don’t know. I tried like hell to get that silver wall back into that scene, but it never never worked.
B: Right. I have self esteem issues, I have problems. I’ve resolved a lot of them, but ‘Dad’ still looms about every now and then. He used to loom about all the time, but I got rid of him.
J: ‘Cos you wouldn’t know the bloke who came up and started talking to you is the bloke who’s sitting here. We met in Carmelita’s, in the light lounge (Bret laughs loudly), and it was my first night in New York, I was 22 and I went to interview Sonic Youth for the NME.
B: You’re telling me about that dive… but it was a cool dive. Up the stairs. Christmas lights all over the place.You had to know people to get in I think. My house was around the corner, it still is, I still have that apartment.
J: Mainly at The Hat. El Sombrero, did you ever go there? It’s still there. On the corner of Lowell and Stanton.
B: I can’t live in New York any more. It’s personal, it’s boredom. Not interested in the literary world. Can’t believe people are still pushy, well, the illusion of it I guess. Everyone I know moved out of New York. All the people I know, I have three friends who live in New York and they’re all rich. Everyone else I knew who lived in New York moved to Brooklyn, and even Brooklyn’s getting expensive. And also New York was a trigger, it was a trigger for drugs… LA isn’t.
B: Yeah, the AA meeting of Robertson and Melrose. But I went to a couple of AA meetings because I wanted to fuck somebody, and I was told that ‘in order for us to keep fucking, you’ve got to get clean’. And so I went under the pretence, and it ended up being like an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm… or Seinfeld. Look, this person is so fucking hot, I’ve got to… the sex is really good, but they said I can’t do anything unless I stop drinking, I have to go to AA, we have to be on the same level. So I did, but I was drinking on the side, away from him. And then I just… I don’t know.
B: I don’t know, how has it? What do you think? That’s an interesting question that you bring that up, because what is the association? What are you thinking of when you ask that?
J: I remember reading interviews with you a long time ago, and people started to question your sexual orientation…
J: And that became like a thing in an interview. There was one I read once and they were alluding to the fact that there was someone in your bed, and they said it was a dog. But now you talk openly about your life.
B: Yeah. Well to a degree, but it depends who I’m talking to. I was being interviewed by Details, and the interviewer, a really nice guy, asked me ‘so what’s going on, do you have a girlfriend? A boyfriend?’ and I thought ‘doesn’t he know?’, and I said ‘who do you think I’m seeing, that’s an interesting question, do I have a girlfriend or a boyfriend, what does that mean?’. He said ‘well that means that you’re bi’, and I said ‘oh, yeah sure, I’m bi, put it in there.’ And that’s what happens. I think the last time I slept with a woman was five or six years ago, so the bi thing can only be played out so long. But I still use it, I still say it.
J: I suppose you were under attack a lot then then? The furore over American Psycho was pretty big then.
B: Yes, much more naturally guarded, but at the same time the problem is, I have no interest at all in gay culture, gay people, gay lifestyle, books about alienated gays, and I know nothing about it. So people don’t often put me in the gay camp. Some people do, and then the gay advertising – the gay papers – never, I’m not mentioned, maybe once in a big one if I know an editor, but never. So, you know what, I just take it as it comes. And I really don’t want to be identified as gay, I really don’t. I don’t even really understand… I have no interest.
J: Have people ever wanted to have sex with you because of the way you write about sex in the books, have you found that?
B: I have found that. I have found that, especially with women. I’m hit on by a lot of women because of that.
B: Yeah they do. But I have not been out on the road in, I don’t know, on a tour like this in, I don’t know… six years? The women will come because I’d now say it’s about fifty-fifty women-men. A lot of young women. One of the first signings of this book was in New York at Barnes and Noble, and there were like a thousand fucking people, it was huge, and the signing went on for hours and hours and hours. Girls, many girls, would come up to me with copies of American Psycho, they’re in their twenties, and they’ll say (whispers) ‘this is my favourite book’, and I’ll say ‘what are you talking about?’ and they’ll say ‘it taught me how to masturbate’.
J: The internet has changed their access to porn. They had their erotic fiction before, now women have the facility to consume porn online in the same way that men did before.
B: So do 11 year-olds. The people I have sex with who are in their early twenties, fuck like pornstars and are completely uninhibited in a way that when I was that age with my peers, we were not that professional. I feel very jealous about that, and I feel that, that kind of liberation is not a bad thing.
J: It’s still so unspoken a lot though isn’t it? Like the penultimate chapter of your Imperial Bedrooms would shock a lot of people – when he goes to Palm Springs with the girl and the guy he’s hired, but it’s like once you float around online, a lot of that stuff is just a click away.
B: That’s what my editor thought. My editor had problems with that passage a lot, we talked about it a lot. He said ‘you’re phoning it in here’, and I said ‘you’re absolutely wrong’. I said ‘this is a sequence that made me want to write the book’, and he said ‘you’re fucking kidding me?’ I said ‘you’re fucking kidding me.’ And he said ‘ok we’re going to have to deal with this’, because that was one sequence we fought on the most.
B: Well when it became apparent that it was never going to happen in a fucking million years, we started to talk about how to re-jigger it, and we didn’t. All I did was I made some cuts I now regret.
J: I assumed it had two purposes for the plot. One – you suddenly seeing Clay in a light that other people in the book see him, but we don’t see that because we’re hearing his voice, so we don’t get other peoples’ perspective, apart from when the other guy goes ‘that girl you beat up, she was pregnant’ – that’s the only other glimpse that you see. And it also put a question mark in your mind over whether he’d been more involved in those murders.
B: Yeah I guess so. It felt totally normal and natural to me, and when I was making the outline for the book… yeah. But I get it, I get it yeah.
J: But you thought, ‘just before the end I’m gonna have something that could’ve come out of American Psycho’.
B: No I wasn’t even thinking about American Psycho. I don’t think about American Psycho like that, but for some reason that’s… I dunno, I love that sequence, I think it’s really beautiful. I think it has some of my best writing in it I really do. And it has to be there. When I realise ‘oh my God, this is where it’s going’, it was thrilling.
I had a book launch last night, I ended up following people, I didn’t really know what was going on, I was just talking to people who were on the streets, I found myself in the Groucho Club. I was just talking to people, following them upstairs, and I was just talking to people, I found myself in a bathroom stall talking to people, and I was flirting with someone from the publishing house at the Groucho Club, and then suddenly people said ‘we’re leaving, we’re leaving, we’re leaving’ and I’m talking to people and I’m smoking, and I’m walking the streets and then I realise we’re back here at Claridge’s, and then I realise there’s like 20 people in this suite, and everyone is ordering up tons of booze and people start smoking in the room which you’re not allowed to do, and then suddenly there’s coke being laid out all over the place. And then I think ‘fuck, I have not done this in many, many, many years, it’s kind of fun.’ And then I notice a lot of people gone and then I realise it’s just me and I was watching a couple fuck on that couch.
B: I don’t know what’s going on in terms of, I just do not have the filters that I had any more, in terms of giving interviews. Like, none of that was off the record, none of it is off the record, and I just don’t care, it’s fine. What is that about?
B: No no. Long pause, and then James: ‘tonight you read to a roomful of women, and…no.’ I guess I am, I’m just doing whatever they ask me to do?
J: Where did you get the character of Rain in Imperial Bedrooms from? Just off the casting couch stories?
B: Yeah. I was really shocked when I was writing and producing The Informers and it was being cast, and as a writer this is what became available to me, I was shocked, and it was true. I had never received more offers for sex from women and men, boys and girls, than I’ve ever had in my life during that six month, pre-production casting.
J: But what about those scenes where Clay goes for dinner with his mates, and they say ‘how long you gonna keep doing this? Pretending you can deliver and then you can’t.’ Was that a little bit like what you thought, ‘I haven’t really got any power’?
B: No I don’t feel that, because Clay has a lot more power than I’ve ever had. He writes big studio movies, and I’ve only had one movie made, and it was a big expensive independent, and it had a very big cast, and there were a lot of attractive women, boys and girls, needed for the movie. But look, whatever, I helped a lot of people. I didn’t necessarily fuck all of those people but I helped them. I became friends with a lot of actors and actresses who I’d met via the casting who were very young, and there were a lot of people who needed a new manager or weren’t very happy with their agent and I would help out, or try and help out. I like actors, a lot, I do. And it’s just, I don’t know. And whenever there’s things I’ve done involving the casting couch it’s really not so bad, it’s kinda funny. It’s not the darkest part of Hollywood, it’s one of the funny parts of Hollywood…It’s ten after five. I better go and get ready. What will you be doing tonight?
B: No, er… yeah. I just don’t wanna like, I just don’t want to have to raise a child. But I also feel like I know how much joy it has brought friends of mine and it is what it is, but I’m not gonna… it’s not on the cards for me.
		Extraordinary interview. Takes the reader right into the room with B.E.E. and fascinates from start to finish. Really brilliant stuff.
		Oh, and great interview too! With you on Lunar Park, thought it was a lot better than Pyscho. One of the best books I've read infact. He even set up some fake websites to back the story up. Great touch. Before I order the new one, do I need to have read Less Than Zero first?
		Just read Less Than Zero. Think it was probably a book of it's time. Not my favourite of his, but I get how it got so much acclaim.
		this i'view left me feeling hazy and weightless. Something like what happens in the film Persona is going on and like the islanders JB accurately describes, both subjects turn in on themselves but then weirdly merge. I need an espresso don't I.
		Really insightful interview. Honest and frank, intriguing to read how both of you opened up to each other.  Best interview I've read in a long time.
		Tremendous interview. The pitch of the questions give us an insight into B.E.E that has previously been hidden behind layers of throwaway comments. Who is next on JB's couch?
		This interview was both incredible and awful. James was just riding his dick for most of it, pretty cringey witnessing him fanboying out like that. And as thrilling as it is to get such an in-depth look into someone so fascinating it's pretty clear why journalists edit down interviews, that was almost as hard to read as some of the chapters in American Psycho crammed full of inane details. However, much like said chapters in American Psycho, i read it all haha. Fascinating stuff
		i can't believe how many people loved this interview...JB was so see through w/ his questions...why not just ask what you really want to ask? JB should have been a therapist or a lawyer not a writer...pretty obvious he's jealous of BEE...
		This interview was terrible. JB was so self indulgent and just embarrassed himself. It wasn't a good insight into BEE at all. It just felt awkward and try hard for most of it.
		Excellent interview. I always thought he'd be an interesting bloke and this proved it. Love his books
		amazing interview. I started reading American Psycho on a whim after glimpsing it in a New York Barnes and Noble. I'd just got back from being an American in London and feeling somewhat empty because I was growing up and the book just appealed to me on so many different levels. This interview was so in-depth. I'm going to read Ellis' other works as well as Ghostwritten.
		Nice interview. Always wondered what he was like after getting to the end of Less Than Zero and feeling surprisingly shocked at what I was reading.
		wow.  excellent & brilliant.  like the verbatim style. similar to the verbatim Q & A style of "hello my big big honey!" ~ and the good thing about the ellis interview is that it is all on the record. thanks
		Excellent interview on both ends -- you definitely get the sense of BEE as the person he is; now if I could only stop loathing that person...
Made me rethink my position on Lunar Park: an unreliable memoir told in the style of a Stephen King pastiche - never really saw the parallels with American Psycho at all.
Weird thing about Rules Of Attraction, I've read it five times since my late teens and every time I read it, I find myself identifying with a different character.  It was Sean last time (for the first time) so take from that what you will. 
		You two are BOTH miserable idiots. Jesus! BEE should just throw himself out the window. He would probably feel better.

Bret Easton EllisWriterBorn: 7 March 1964Birthplace: Los Angeles, CaliforniaBest known as: The author of Less Than ZeroNovelist Bret Easton Ellis rocketed to fame with his first book, 1985's Less Than Zero, published while Ellis was a student at Vermont's Bennington College (his fellow students included future literature stars Donna Tartt and Jonathan Lethem).  The book -- and the 1987 movie version -- struck a chord with an American public ready to learn about rich and pretty drug users having sex.  The publicity and hype surrounding the book put Ellis in the spotlight, and the subsequent focus on his celebrity has made it difficult for critics to separate the writer from his work.  Not a prolific author, Ellis nonetheless maintains a respectable career; a new novel is still an event guaranteed to earn reviews from "is he really that good?" to "he really is that good."  His other novels include The Rules of Attraction (1987), American Psycho (1990), Glamorama (1998), Lunar Park (2005) and Imperial Bedrooms (2010).  He has also published a collection of connected stories, The Informers (1994), and a novella, Water from the Sun (2006).Extra credit: Other films based on Ellis's books include American Psycho (2000, starring Christian Bale) and The Rules of Attraction (2002, starring James Van Der Beek)...  It was reported in 2007 that Ellis was signed to develop The Canyons, a cable television soap opera.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Bret Easton Ellis was born on March 7, 1964 in Los Angeles, California, USA. He is a writer and producer, known for American Psycho (2000), The Informers (2008) and The Rules of Attraction (2002).
        Long descriptive paragraphs in which characters discuss meaningless or unimportant events and objects
      His influences include: Hemingway, Joan Didion, Joyce, Flaubert, and Dennis Cooper; plus books, movies, TV and rock and roll.
      Simon and Schuster gave him a $300,000 advance for American Psycho then refused to publish it after women's groups and women within the company protested. Luckily, the book was picked up by Vintage.
      Was 21 when his first novel was published (Less Than Zero, 1985) while Bret was still a student at Bennington College).
      Received numerous death threats and hate mail after the publication of his graphically violent novel American Psycho. Today, the novel is considered by many his best work yet.
      In his novel "American Psycho", he borrowed a character from Tana Janowitz's short story collection "Slaves of New York" (Stash) and a character from Jay McInerney's book "Story of My Life" (Alison Poole). In a recent interview he said that the inclusion of Alison Poole was because he was upset at McInerney over something (he couldn't recall) and his revenge was to have her attacked by Patrick Bateman. She then appeared in his novel "Glamorama."
      Has cross-referenced characters in his books. For example, Blair and Julian from "Less Than Zero" are mentioned in "The Informers", Sean Bateman from "The Rules of Attraction" is the younger brother of Patrick Bateman in "American Psycho".
      Working on his 7th novel and sequel to "Less Than Zero", entitled "Imperial Bedrooms". Expected release is 2010. [February 2009]
      (Movies are) much more powerful sensory experiences than novels. A novel is a different kind of transport, I guess, and it's very easy to let a movie envelop you. It's difficult for a novel to have that same power, because one is a passive experience and one is an active experience. You're working with the novel as you read it, creating your own virtual reality. You're picturing what everyone looks like, what everyone's wearing, what the scene looks like in your mind, and the movie's doing all that for you. It's the rare book that's able to transport you in a way that a movie does. Even a not-so-good movie can kind of give you some thrills or a rush. I mean, we all see so many more movies than we do read novels. It's not a problem, it's just how it is.
      (on the negative reception of Less Than Zero (1987)) "Well, who was happy with it? I don't know anyone who was happy with it. The director wasn't happy with it, and it was this compromised movie for many, many reasons. I don't think it began that way - I think that Scott Rudin and Barry Diller, who were the ones who brought it to 20th Century Fox, had a very different movie in mind. I think when there was the regime change at the studio with Leonard Goldberg taking over, who was a family man who had kids, it became a different beast. I grew up around Hollywood, and I had no real desire to see the book made into a movie. I thought, 'Well, we'll take the money, and 98% of all books optioned never make it to the screen, so...'"
      (why The Rules of Attraction (2002) was not set in the 1980's) "I think there were some sort of commercial problems with that. The studio thought its main audience was college kids today - which it wasn't, because no one went to see the movie. I think there was a compromise, because the movie doesn't announce so strongly that it's taking place now. It's in this hazy middle period of 80's music and 80's references, and yet there are cell phones and computers. But that's just wallpaper. I think the movie itself is the one movie that captured my sensibility in a visual and cinematic language."
      I think my sensibility is very literary; all my books were built as books, and I wasn't thinking about them being movies. If I want to write a movie, I'll write a screenplay, but if I have an idea for a book, it's something that I think can only be done novelistically. That's why I think, personally, that they're very tricky to adapt - that, and the fact that my narrators are semi-secretive and unreliable at times.
      (on what went wrong with The Informers (2008)) "You need someone who understood that milieu. You need a Breck Eisner, you need someone who grew up around here. You also need someone with an Altman-esque sense of humor, because the script is really funny. The movie is not funny at all, and there are scenes in the movie that should be funny that we wrote as funny, and they're played as we wrote them, but they're directed in a way that they're not funny. It was very distressing to see the cuts of this movie and realize that all the laughs were gone."
      (on The Informers (2008)) "I was involved until the writer's strike hit, and that banned any writers from visiting the set. Everyone followed that rule because everyone was really scared about what might happen. So, I was involved with The Informers until about a week or two after filming [began], because I was on set rewriting scenes. Then when the writer's strike hit, I was told I could not go back on that set or I would be...whatever. Whatever happens to writers when they do that."
      It's interesting. It's interesting to be a producer and a writer on a movie that's going to be shot in this town. It's very interesting to see what happens with actors and actresses....It's very interesting... what is available to you.
      Regardless of the business aspect of things, is there a reason that there isn't a female Hitchcock or a female Scorsese or a female Spielberg? I don't know. I think it's a medium that really is built for the male gaze and for a male sensibility. I mean, the best art is made under not an indifference to, but a neutrality [toward] the kind of emotionalism that I think can be a trap for women directors. But I have to get over it, because so far this year, two of my favorite movies were made by women, Fish Tank (2009) and The Runaways (2010). I've got to start rethinking that, although I have to say that a lot of the big studio movies I saw last year that were directed by women were far worse than the shitty big-budget studio movies that were directed by men.
      Every one of my books is an exercise in voice and character, an exploration, through a male narrator who is always the same age I am at the time, of the pain I'm dealing with in my life. [Interview with Jon-Jon Goulian, 2012.]
