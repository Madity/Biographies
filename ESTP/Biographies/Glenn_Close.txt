Glenn Close (born March 19, 1947)[1] is an American film, television and stage actress. Throughout her long and varied career, she has been consistently acclaimed for her versatility and is considered by many to be one of the greatest actresses of all time.[2][3] She has won three Emmy Awards, three Tony Awards and received six Academy Award nominations.
Close began her professional stage career in 1974 in Love for Love, and was mostly a Broadway actress through the rest of the 1970s and early 1980s, appearing in both plays and musicals, including major productions such as Barnum in 1980 and The Real Thing in 1983, for which she won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. Her first film role was in The World According to Garp (1982), which she followed up with supporting roles in The Big Chill (1983), and The Natural (1984); all three earned her nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She would later receive nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performances in Fatal Attraction (1987), Dangerous Liaisons (1988), and Albert Nobbs (2011). In the 1990s, she won two more Tony Awards, for Death and the Maiden in 1992 and Sunset Boulevard in 1995. She returns to Broadway in the fall of 2014 in a revival of Edward Albee's A Delicate Balance [4]
On television, she won her first Emmy for the 1995 TV movie Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story. She starred as Eleanor of Aquitaine in the 2003 version of The Lion in Winter, winning a Golden Globe. In 2005, she starred in the drama series The Shield, then from 2007-2012, she starred as Patty Hewes in the FX drama series Damages, a role that won her a Golden Globe and two Emmys.
Close is a six-time Academy Award nominee, tying the record for being the actress with the most nominations never to have won (along with Deborah Kerr and Thelma Ritter). In addition, she has been nominated for four Tonys (three wins), fourteen Emmys (three wins), fourteen Golden Globes (two wins) and eight Screen Actors Guild Awards (one win). She has also been nominated three times for a Grammy Award and once for a BAFTA.
Close was born in Greenwich, Connecticut, the daughter of Bettine (née Moore) and William Taliaferro Close,[1] a doctor who operated a clinic in the Belgian Congo and served as a personal physician to Congo/Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko.[5] Her father was a descendant of the Taliaferros of Virginia; her paternal grandfather, Edward Bennett Close, a stockbroker and director of the American Hospital Association,[6] was first married to Post Cereals' Marjorie Merriweather Post. Close is also a second cousin once-removed of actress Brooke Shields (Shields's great-grandmother Mary Elsie Moore was a sister of Close's maternal grandfather, Charles Arthur Moore, Jr.).[7]
During her childhood, Close lived with her parents in a stone cottage on her maternal grandfather's estate, in Greenwich.[8] Close has credited her early years for her acting abilities: "I have no doubt that the days I spent running free in the evocative Connecticut countryside with an unfettered imagination, playing whatever character our games demanded, is one of the reasons that acting has always seemed so natural to me."[9] When she was seven years old, her parents joined a "cult group", the Moral Re-Armament (MRA), in which her family remained involved for fifteen years, living in communal centers. Close has stated that the family "struggled to survive the pressures of a culture that dictated everything about how we lived our lives." Close traveled for several years in the mid-to-late 1960s with an MRA singing group called Up With People, and attended Rosemary Hall (now Choate Rosemary Hall), graduating in 1965.[8][10]
When she was 22, Close broke away from MRA, attending the College of William & Mary, and double majoring in theatre and anthropology. It was in the College's theatre department that she began to train as a serious actor, under Howard Scammon, W&M's long-time professor of theatre. During her years at school in Williamsburg she also stared in the summer-time outdoor drama, "The Common Glory," written by Pulitzer Prize author Paul Green.[11] She was elected to membership in the honor society of Phi Beta Kappa.[8] Through the years she has returned to W&M to lecture and visit the theatre department. In 1989 she was the commencement speaker at W&M and received an honorary doctor of arts degree.
Close started her professional stage career in 1974, and her film work in 1982.[8] She has been nominated for six Academy Awards, for Best Actress in Dangerous Liaisons, Fatal Attraction, and Albert Nobbs and for Best Supporting Actress in The Natural, The Big Chill, and The World According to Garp (her first film).[8] Her six nominations have her tied with Deborah Kerr and Thelma Ritter as the most nominated actress not to win an Oscar.
After her sixth Oscar nomination, Close was asked about the fact of not having an Oscar, for which she answered: "And I remember being astounded that I met some people who were really kind of almost hyper-ventilating as to whether they were going to win or not [the Oscar], and I have never understood that. Because if you just do the simple math, the amount of people who are in our two unions, the amount of people who in our profession are out of work at any given time, the amount of movies that are made every year, and then you’re one of five. How could you possibly think of yourself as a loser?”
In total she has been nominated fourteen times for an Emmy (winning three)[12] and thirteen times at the Golden Globes (winning two).
In 1984, Close starred in the critically acclaimed drama Something About Amelia, a Golden Globe-winning television movie about a family destroyed by sexual abuse. In 1987 she played the disturbed book editor Alex in Fatal Attraction, and in 1988 she played the scheming aristocrat The Marquise de Merteuil in Dangerous Liaisons.[8] She played the role of Sunny von Bülow in the 1990 film Reversal of Fortune to critical acclaim.
In the 1990s, she starred in the highly rated Hallmark Hall of Fame television drama Sarah, Plain and Tall (1991), as well as its two sequels. She also played the title role in the made-for-TV movie Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story in 1995, for which she won her first Emmy. She also appeared in the newsroom comedy-drama The Paper (1994), Steven Spielberg's Hook, the alien invasion satire Mars Attacks! (1996, as The First Lady), the Disney hit 101 Dalmatians (1996, as the sinister Cruella de Vil) and its sequel 102 Dalmatians (2000), and the blockbuster Air Force One (1997), as the trustworthy vice president to Harrison Ford's president. In 2001, she starred in a production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's classic musical South Pacific.
In 2005, Close joined the FX crime series The Shield, in which she played a no-nonsense precinct captain. She starred in a series of her own for 2007, Damages (also on FX) instead of continuing her character on The Shield. Close won the 2009 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama series for her role in Damages.[15] In an interview after her win, Close stated that her role of Patty Hewes in the series was the role of her life. Also in 2009, she narrated the environmental film Home.
In December 2010, Close began filming Albert Nobbs in Dublin. She had previously won an Obie in 1982 for her role in the play on stage. She had been working on the film, in which she appeared alongside 101 Dalmatians co-star Mark Williams, for 10 years, and aside from starring in it, she co-wrote the screenplay and produced the film.[16][17]
In the film, Close played the title role of Albert Nobbs, a woman living her life as a man in 1800s Ireland after being sexually assaulted as a young girl. For the film, Close sat through hours of makeup to transform herself into a man. While the film itself received mixed reviews, Close and Janet McTeer received rave reviews for their performances. Close's performance was noted for being her most subtle and introverted performance yet and a departure from her other roles. Close received Academy Award, Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, and multiple critics nominations for her performance in Albert Nobbs.
Recently Close along with Viola Davis and Uma Thurman was featured in the Documentary Love, Marilyn reading excerpts from Marilyn Monroe's diaries. Critic Stephen Farber has described the film as "One of the most skillful and entertaining summaries of Marilyn's endlessly fascinating rise and fall."[18] Close is set to appear as Nova Prime Rael in Guardians of the Galaxy, scheduled for release in 2014.[19][20]
Close has had an extensive career performing in Broadway musicals. One of her most notable roles on stage was Norma Desmond in the Andrew Lloyd Webber production of Sunset Boulevard, for which Close won a Tony Award, playing the role on Broadway in 1994.[8] Close was also a guest star at the Andrew Lloyd Webber fiftieth birthday party celebration in the Royal Albert Hall in 1998. She appeared as Norma Desmond and performed songs from Sunset Boulevard. Close has also won Tony Awards in 1984 for The Real Thing, and in 1992 for Death and the Maiden.[8] Close performed at Carnegie Hall, narrating the violin concerto The Runaway Bunny, a concerto for reader, violin and orchestra, composed and conducted by Glen Roven.
Close provided the voice of the "Giant" in the Summer 2012 production of the musical Into the Woods at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. The production also featured Amy Adams as The Baker's Wife and Donna Murphy as The Witch.[21]
In October 2014, Close returns to Broadway in the starring role of Agnes in Pam MacKinnon's revival of Edward Albee's A Delicate Balance. She stars opposite John Lithgow as Tobias, Martha Plimpton as Julia and Lindsay Duncan as Claire. The production will play the Golden Theatre.[4]
Close was married to Cabot Wade, a guitarist whom she had met during her time at Up with People, from 1969 to 1971.[22] From 1979 to 1983 she dated Broadway actor Len Cariou.[22] She was married to businessman James Marlas from 1984 to 1987.[22] Soon afterward, she began a relationship with producer John Starke, whom she had previously met on the set of The World According to Garp.[22] In 1988 the two had a daughter together, Annie Starke, who is currently an aspiring actress.[23] They separated in 1991.[22]
In 1995 Close was engaged to carpenter Steve Beers, who had worked on Sunset Boulevard, but the two never married, and they separated in 1999.[22]
Close is a dog lover and writes a blog for Fetchdog.com, where she interviews other famous people about their relationships with their dogs.[25] Close announced to the public that she has had her DNA sequenced.[26]
Close has donated money to the election campaigns of many Democratic politicians, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, Howard Dean, John Edwards and Barack Obama.[27]
Close was a founder and is chairperson of BringChange2Mind, a US campaign to eradicate the stigma and discrimination surrounding mental illness, supporting her sister Jessie who has bipolar disorder.[28] During the month of July 2013, Close put up over 380 designer items up for auction on eBay from the wardrobe her character Patty Hewes wore on Damages. All proceeds were raised to go to her charity BringChange2Mind.[29]

      It's gotten out of control. It's taking bigger and bigger names to make smaller and smaller films. I worry that important films without a big name attached won't get made at all.
      [on her 1984 Tony win for playing Annie in "The Real Thing"] It was the cherry on the cake for one of the great experiences of my career.
      I love the chemistry that can be created onstage between the actors and the audience. It's molecular even, the energies that can go back and forth. I started in theater. and when I first went into movies I felt that my energy was going to blow out the camera.
      [1996, on her role in Mary Reilly (1996)] I called Stephen Frears, who had directed me in Dangerous Liaisons (1988), and I said, 'C'mon, everyone from Dangerous is in this film, I want a part.' I felt left out. So he gave me the part of a bordello owner, and I thought it would take a week-go to London, have some fun, and come home. But it was hard. They wanted this Liverpudlian accent and Stephen was great, because he kept pushing me to do stuff that I didn't know how to do. The character, I think, was quite interesting. But she's in only three scenes."
      [1996, on her role in The Paper (1994)] I love Ron Howard, he's a wonderful director, incredibly prepared. But I have to criticize my performance in that movie. It all took place in one day. My character was having a bad day, so she's having a bad day throughout the whole movie. But this was a comedy, and I think I was too serious, too dense. Yes, I think that describes my failure there.
      [1996, on Dangerous Liaisons (1988)] We filmed in France and I had given birth to Annie seven weeks before we started preparing for the film. For the first time in my life, I had these great breasts. It'll never happen again, but for one brief, shining season, I had the most incredible breasts. James Acheson, the costume designer, who won the Oscar this year for Restoration (1995), did the costumes, and I just loved it because they pushed my breasts up and made me have cleavage. I guess I should be saying something more intellectual about the film, but I just remembered how great it felt to have those breasts.
      [1996, on Fatal Attraction (1987)] The original ending was a gorgeous piece of film noir. She kills herself, but makes sure that his prints are all over the knife, and he gets arrested. He knows he didn't do it, but he's going to jail anyway. But audiences wanted some kind of cathartic ending, so we went back months later and shot the ending that's in the movie now.
      The best thing I have is the knife from Fatal Attraction (1987). I hung it in my kitchen. It's my way of saying, Don't mess with me.
      It always amazes me to think that every house on every street is full of so many stories; so many triumphs and tragedies, and all we see are yards and driveways.
      [on her Oscar-nominated role as Albert Nobbs] Albert is a survivor and I think she chose an invisible job. An invisible person chose an invisible job. In nineteenth-century Victorian times, servants weren't supposed to to look at anybody in the eye. They don't see you, they don't talk to you, you don't talk to them.
      [on bringing Albert Nobbs (2011) to the screen] I really hope it engenders a lot of conversation because I believe there are a lot of people who put on faces. We all do it, every time we walk out the door. And there are a lot of people who have to hide who they are. And I think this story speaks to that.
      What's so fascinating about people is what they don't show. People are masters at it; usually actors show too much.
      Good live theater disturbs molecules. You create an energy source around yourself and it alternates between you and the audience. Anybody who sees live theater should come out a little rearranged.
      Acting, to me, is about the incredible adventure of examining the landscape of human heart and soul. That's basically what we do.
      The word diva has a negative connotation. My definition of a diva is somebody whose talent does not match what they're trying to play, so all this temperament comes out.
      I think there are certain actors that have that kind of energy about them, that taking over a room energy.
      I've been sacrificing my life for my work for 30 years, and now I want it the other way around. I want to find work that fits into my life and that would be based here.
      [on Bette Davis] She wasn't trying to please people. She didn't say, "Love me." She had the courage to play unattractive characters with only the hope that people understand them in the end.
      I don't have the body or the face for romantic comedies, so I've never been offered those. The challenge is that a lot of people see you only as your last character, so you're constantly competing with whatever your last movie was.
      With the hugely talented women I've worked with or observed, it's not a question about temperament or ego; it's a question about getting it right. If they've got a reputation for being difficult it's usually because they just don't suffer fools.
      It puts you in a kind of a strange situation where everybody is looking at every little thing you do.
      [on mental illness] It is an odd paradox that a society, which can now speak openly and unabashedly about topics that were once unspeakable, still remains largely silent when it comes to mental illness. Illnesses that were once discussed only in hushed tones are now part of healthy conversation and activism. Yet when it comes to bipolar disorder, PTSD, schizophrenia or depression, an uncharacteristic coyness takes over. We often say nothing. And so we marginalize the people who most need our acceptance. Our society ought to understand that many people with mental illness, given the right treatment, can be full participants in our society.
      All your life you think 60 is ancient, and all of a sudden you find you're 60 and you don't really feel that different. I feel stronger and more engaged. This is the best time of my life.
      It's not good to be in a situation where people don't want to direct you or don't want to question something.
      Listen to that little voice that says, 'Mmm, I don't think so.' Because when you override that, you basically override who you are.
      I don't live in Hollywood. I try to live a quiet life. I don't go out to a lot of events, and I don't go out buying a lot of clothes.
      In some ways, gender should be irrelevant. It shouldn't matter who someone is connected to and finds love and a life with. I hope [full federal equality] will come to be a reality for the LGBT world.
      I find it quite amusing that I can frighten children by just saying, 'puppies.' Usually they're disappointed I don't actually have black and white hair.
      Learn to walk in each other's shoes. In a world that is depending more and more on screens of various sizes, don't forget to look into each other's faces. Don't forget the power of two eyes looking into two other eyes, and don't forget to listen to each other's voices.
      The Oscars for me is a huge honor to be recognized for whatever you've done, the body of work or movie you're being recognized for. But I'm not alone in my profession in thinking it's a bit crazy to say who's better than the other one because you're talking about art and artists.
      My dad was a surgeon and a very high achiever, and being an actress probably isn't a career that he had thought for me. So he actually told me that I'd better learn shorthand as a backup. I took such a course during college and I was really bad at it.
      Love makes no sense at all. But it's the most powerful and amazing force in the entire universe.
      I think it is a great privilege, to be an actor. I think our job is to make people believe. Everyone wants to believe something. And besides helping people believe, I think we can remind people what it means to be a human being; how connected we are, how we need love, how hate is destructive. That to me is a privilege.
      [on the process of making a good movie] Start with great writing, then surround yourself with people worth spending time with.
      [on Fatal Attraction (1987)] People still come up to me and say, "You scared the shit out of me."
      I always thought I was overweight. I look back and think I was a totally unfinished, insecure person. I was always morbidly shy outside of my family, and it's still pretty much my idea of hell to go into a room full of people holding cocktail glasses.
      [on becoming a mother] It's just balance all the time. I'm very happy to have work that my daughter can observe that I love. She'll see somebody who's very involved and passionate about what she does, and hopefully someday she'll have that same kind of fulfillment.
      [on Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)] I'm doing that because it will then afford me to go do the other kind of movies that I really love. And hopefully I will have a great time. It'll be a new experience for me, but practically speaking it will mean that I can do those smaller movies and it'll be okay.
      [on theatre] To me, it's where you really develop as an artist. I have a huge respect for film acting, but onstage, you don't have editors and you don't have sound people. You don't have the close-up. You're out there with your fellow actors and the audience. It's a chemical mixture that's happened for centuries! There's nothing for me that really substitutes that.
      [on Katharine Hepburn telling her she was talented but that her feet were too big for audiences to take her seriously as an actress] I had to laugh when I read that. I've been thinking about writing an Op Ed piece about her. A few years ago I participated in a Kennedy Center Honors tribute to her and she wrote me a wonderful letter afterwards. I know she came to see us three times when I was on Broadway in "The Real Thing." That's where the feet thing came from. I was barefoot in it.

Born in a town her ancestors helped to create, Glenn Close came from a privileged family with two patrician parents in Greenwich, Connecticut. Soon after her parents joined the Moral Rearmament, an ultra-conservative political movement, they moved to Zaire, Africa. After attending boarding school in Zaire and Switzerland, she and her siblings returned to Greenwich to live with their maternal grandmother. Her love of acting was nurtured in Rosemary Hall, an exclusive girls' boarding school. She formed a six-member theatrical troupe, The Fingernails (self-billed as "The Group With Polish") and performed the more challenging roles in school plays. 
The Moral Rearmament came into Glenn's life and during her years at the College of William and Mary she joined the movements singing group. There, she traveled around the country singing in defense of the movement's values. She returned to her college after an emotional fallout from her 1969 marriage to guitarist Cabot Wade.
She joined the New Phoenix Repertory Company after graduating and in 1974 played the lead role in a Broadway production of Love for Love. After six years of theater work, she was offered her first feature film role, that of Robin Williams's fearlessly feminist mother in 1982's The World According to Garp. Her performance was rewarded with her first Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Over the next few years she received two more nominations for Best Supporting Actress as well as three nominations for Best Actress, the most recent for her amazing performance as a woman masquerading as a man in Victorian England in Albert Nobbs.
Television has also proven to be a fertile medium for Close's talent. She has won a total of three Emmy awards between 1984 and 1995. On stage, Close scored her first Tony for Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing in 1984, and won her second, eight years later, for her performance in Ariel Dorfman's Death and the Maiden. In 1995, she snagged a third Tony, this time for her performance as Sunset Boulevard's narcissistic silent-screen star Norma Desmond. 
Close has been married and divorced twice, first to Cabot Wade and then to venture capitalist James Marlas. She has a child with producer John Starke. Following May-September flings with actor Woody Harrelson and hockey star Cam Neely, Close began a relationship with Steve Beers, a carpenter she met in 1995 on the set of Sunset Boulevard. In 2006, she married her third husband, David Shaw. 
In 2005, after having been nominated for a Golden Globe seven times, Close won the award for her performance in the TV movie The Lion in Winter.
