Editorial assistant, Harpers & Queen, Harper's Bazaar; fashion editor, Viva, Savvy, New York; creative director, U.S. Vogue; editor-in-chief, British Vogue and House & Garden
Anna Wintour, OBE (born 3 November 1949) is the English editor-in-chief of American Vogue, a position she has held since 1988. In 2013, she became artistic director for Condé Nast, Vogue's publisher. With her trademark pageboy bob haircut and sunglasses, Wintour has become an important figure in much of the fashion world, widely praised for her eye for fashion trends and her support for younger designers. Her reportedly aloof and demanding personality has earned her the nickname "Nuclear Wintour" (sounds like nuclear winter).
She is the eldest daughter of Charles Wintour, editor of the London Evening Standard. Her father consulted her on how to make the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era. Anna became interested in fashion as a teenager. Her career in fashion journalism began at two British magazines. Later, she moved to the United States, with stints at New York and House & Garden. She returned home for a year to turn around British Vogue, and later assumed control of the franchise's magazine in New York, reviving what many saw as a stagnating publication. Her use of the magazine to shape the fashion industry has been the subject of debate within it. Animal rights activists have attacked her for promoting fur, while other critics have charged her with using the magazine to promote elitist views of femininity and beauty.
A former personal assistant, Lauren Weisberger, wrote the 2003 best selling roman à clef The Devil Wears Prada, later made into a successful film starring Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly, a fashion editor, believed to be based on Wintour. In 2009, she was the focus of another film, R.J. Cutler's documentary The September Issue.
Wintour was born in London, in 1949, to Charles Wintour (1917–1999), editor of the Evening Standard, and Eleanor "Nonie" Trego Baker, daughter of a Harvard law professor. Her parents married in 1940 and divorced in 1979. Wintour was named after her maternal grandmother, Anna Baker (born Gilkynson), a merchant's daughter from Pennsylvania.[2] Audrey Slaughter, a magazine editor who founded publications such as Honey and Petticoat, is her stepmother.[3][4] The late-18th-century novelist Lady Elizabeth Foster, Duchess of Devonshire, was Wintour's great-great-great-grandmother, and Sir Augustus Vere Foster, the last Baronet of that name, was a granduncle.[5]
She had four siblings. Her older brother, Gerald, died in a traffic accident as a child.[6] One of her younger brothers, Patrick, is also a journalist, currently political editor of The Guardian.[7] James and Nora Wintour have worked in London local government and for international non-governmental organisations respectively.[8][9]
In her youth, Wintour was educated at the independent North London Collegiate School, where she frequently rebelled against the dress code by taking up the hemlines of her skirts.[10] At the age of 14, she began wearing her hair in a bob.[11] She developed an interest in fashion as a regular viewer of Cathy McGowan on Ready Steady Go!,[12] and from the issues of Seventeen her grandmother sent from America.[13] "Growing up in London in the '60s, you'd have to have had Irving Penn's sack over your head not to know something extraordinary was happening in fashion," she recalled.[14] Her father regularly consulted her when he was considering ideas for increasing readership in the youth market.[12]
At the age of 15, she began dating well-connected older men. She was involved briefly with Piers Paul Read, then 24.[15] In her later teens, she and gossip columnist Nigel Dempster became a fixture on the London club circuit.[16]
"I think my father really decided for me that I should work in fashion", she recalled in The September Issue.[13] He arranged for his daughter's first job, at the influential Biba boutique, when she was 15.[17] The next year, she left North London Collegiate and began a training program at Harrods. At her parents' behest, she also took fashion classes at a nearby school. Soon she gave them up, saying, "You either know fashion or you don't."[18] Another older boyfriend, Richard Neville, gave her her first experience of magazine production at his popular and controversial Oz.[19]
In 1970, when Harper's Bazaar UK merged with Queen to become Harper's & Queen, Wintour was hired as one of its first editorial assistants, beginning her career in fashion journalism.[20] She told her co-workers that she wanted to edit Vogue.[21] While there, she discovered model Annabel Hodin, a former North London classmate. Her connections helped her secure locations for innovative shoots by Helmut Newton, Jim Lee[22] and other trend-setting photographers.[23] One recreated the works of Renoir and Manet using models in go-go boots.[24] After chronic disagreements with her rival, Min Hogg,[25] she quit and moved to New York with her boyfriend, freelance journalist Jon Bradshaw.[26]
In her new home, she became a junior fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar in New York City in 1975.[24] Wintour's innovative shoots led editor Tony Mazzola to fire her after nine months.[27] She was introduced to Bob Marley by one of Bradshaw's friends, and disappeared with him for a week.[28] A few months later, Bradshaw helped her get her first position as a fashion editor, at Viva, a women's adult magazine started by Kathy Keeton, then wife of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione. She has rarely discussed working there, due to that connection.[29] This was the first job at which she was able to hire a personal assistant, which began her reputation as a demanding and difficult boss.[30]
In late 1978, Guccione shut down the unprofitable magazine. Wintour decided to take some time off from work. She broke up with Bradshaw and began a relationship with French record producer Michel Esteban, for two years dividing her time with him between Paris and New York.[31] She returned to work in 1980, succeeding Elsa Klensch as fashion editor for a new women's magazine named Savvy.[32] It sought to appeal to career-conscious professional women, who spent their own money,[33] the readers Wintour would later target at Vogue.[34]
The following year, she became fashion editor of New York.[24] There, the fashion spreads and photo shoots she had been putting together for years finally began attracting attention. Editor Edward Kosner sometimes bent very strict rules for her and let her work on other sections of the magazine. She learned through her work on a cover involving Rachel Ward how effectively celebrity covers sold copies.[35] "Anna saw the celebrity thing coming before everyone else did," Grace Coddington said three decades later.[36] A former colleague arranged for an interview with Vogue editor Grace Mirabella that ended when Wintour told Mirabella she wanted her job.[37][38]
She went to work at Vogue later when Alex Liberman, editorial director for Condé Nast, publisher of Vogue, talked to Wintour about a position there in 1983. She eventually accepted after a bidding war that doubled her salary, becoming the magazine's first creative director, a position with vaguely defined responsibilities.[39] Her changes to the magazine were often made without Mirabella's knowledge, causing friction among the staff.[40] She began dating child psychiatrist David Shaffer, an older acquaintance from London.[41] They married in 1984.[42]
In 1985, Wintour attained her first editorship, taking over British Vogue after Beatrix Miller retired.[43] Once in charge, she replaced many staffers and exerted far more control over the magazine than any previous editor had, earning the nickname "Nuclear Wintour" in the process.[44] Those editors who were retained began to refer to the period as "The Wintour of Our Discontent."[45] Her changes moved the magazine from its traditional eccentricity to a direction more in line with the American magazine. Wintour's ideal reader was the same woman Savvy had tried to reach. "There's a new kind of woman out there," she told the Evening Standard. "She's interested in business and money. She doesn't have time to shop anymore. She wants to know what and why and where and how."[32]
In 1987, Wintour returned to New York to take over House & Garden. Its circulation had long lagged behind rival Architectural Digest,[46] and Condé Nast hoped she could improve it. Again, she made radical changes to staff and look, canceling $2 million worth of photo spreads and articles in her first week.[47] She put so much fashion in photo spreads that it became known as House & Garment, and enough celebrities that it was referred to as Vanity Chair, within the industry.[34]
Those changes worsened the magazine's problems. When the title was shortened to just HG, many longtime subscribers thought they were getting a new magazine and put it aside for the real thing to arrive.[46] Most of those subscriptions were eventually canceled, and while some fashion advertisers came over, most of the magazine's traditional advertisers pulled out.[48]
Ten months later, she finally became editor of Vogue. Under Mirabella, it had become more focused on lifestyles as a whole and less on fashion.[34] Industry insiders worried that it was losing ground to the recently introduced American edition of Elle.[32][34]
After making sweeping changes in staff, Wintour also changed the style of the cover pictures. Mirabella had preferred tight head shots of well-known models in studios; Wintour's covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, like those Diana Vreeland had done years earlier.[32] She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with the high fashion: the first issue she was in charge of, November 1988, featured a Peter Lindbergh photograph of 19-year-old Michaela Bercu in a $50 pair of faded jeans and a bejeweled jacket by Christian Lacroix worth $10,000. It was the first time a Vogue cover model had worn jeans[34] (Bercu was originally supposed to have worn the skirt that coordinated with the jacket, but she had gained some weight and it didn't fit). In 2012 Wintour reflected on the cover:
It was so unlike the studied and elegant close-ups that were typical of Vogue’s covers back then, with tons of makeup and major jewelry. This one broke all the rules. Michaela wasn't looking at you, and worse, she had her eyes almost closed. Her hair was blowing across her face. It looked easy, casual, a moment that had been snapped on the street, which it had been, and which was the whole point. Afterwards, in the way that these things can happen, people applied all sorts of interpretations: It was about mixing high and low, Michaela was pregnant, it was a religious statement. But none of these things was true. I had just looked at that picture and sensed the winds of change. And you can’t ask for more from a cover image than that.[49]
Years later, Wintour admitted the photo had never been planned as the cover shot. In 2011 when "Vogue" put its entire archive on line, Wintour was quoted as saying, "I just said, 'Well, let's just try this.' And off we went. It was just very natural. To me it just said, 'This is something new. This is something different." The printers called to make sure that was supposed to be the cover, as they thought a mistake might have been made.[50]
"Wintour's approach hit a nerve—this was the way real women put clothes together (with the likely exception of wearing multi-thousand-dollar T-shirts)", one reviewer says. On the June 1989 cover, another model was shown in wet hair, with just a bathrobe and no apparent makeup.[34] Photographers, makeup artists, and hairstylists got credited along with the models.[32]
Under her editorship, the magazine renewed its focus on fashion and returned to the prominence it had held under Vreeland. Vogue held its position as market leader against three contenders: Elle; Harper's Bazaar, which had lured away Liz Tilberis, Wintour's most prominent deputy, and Mirabella, a magazine Rupert Murdoch created for Wintour's fired predecessor. Her most serious competitor was within the company: Tina Brown, editor of Vanity Fair and later The New Yorker.[51]
At the end of the decade, another of Wintour's inner circle left to run Harper's Bazaar. Kate Betts, seen as Wintour's likely successor, had broadened the magazine's reach by commissioning stories with a more hard-news edge, about women in politics, street culture, and the financial difficulties of some major designers. She had also added the "Index" section, a few pages of tips meant to be torn out of the magazine. At staff meetings, she earned Wintour's respect as the only person who publicly challenged her.[52]
The two began to disagree about the magazine's direction. Betts felt Vogue's fashion coverage was getting too limited. Wintour in turn thought that the stories with popular culture angles Betts was assigning were beneath readers, and began pairing Betts with Plum Sykes, whom Betts reportedly detested as a "pretentious airhead". Eventually, she left, complaining to the New York Times that Wintour had not even sent her a baby gift. Wintour wrote an editor's letter that complimented Betts and wished her well.[53]
Betts was one of several longtime editors to leave Vogue around the new millennium. A year later, Sykes, another putative successor, left to concentrate on her best-selling novels set in the city's upper classes and a screenplay. A number of other editors also left to assume the top jobs at other publications. While some of their replacements didn't last, a new group of core editors formed.[54]
The September 2004 issue was 832 pages, the largest issue of a monthly magazine ever published at that time, since exceeded by the September 2007 issue Cutler's documentary covered.[34] She also oversaw the introduction of three spinoffs: Teen Vogue, Vogue Living and Men's Vogue. Teen Vogue has published more ad pages and earned more advertiser revenue than either Elle Girl and Cosmo Girl, and the 164 ad pages in the début issue of Men's Vogue were the most for a first issue in Condé Nast history.[55] AdAge named her "Editor of the Year" for this brand expansion.[56] Queen Elizabeth II appointed her Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.[57][58]
That year was generally difficult, as the economy worsened. After ruffling feathers at the Milan shows in February, the April issue's cover image of LeBron James and Gisele Bündchen brought criticism for its evocation of racial stereotypes. The next month a lavish Karl Lagerfeld gown she wore to the Met's Costume Institute Gala was called "the worst fashion faux pas of 2008." In the fall, Vogue Living was suspended indefinitely, and Men's Vogue cut back to two issues a year as an outsert or supplement to the women's magazine. At the end of the year, December's cover highlighted a disparaging comment Jennifer Aniston made about Angelina Jolie, to the former's displeasure. It seemed Wintour had lost her touch.[59][60]
In 2008, rumours arose that she would retire,[61] and be replaced by French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld.[62] An editor at Russian GQ reportedly introduced Russian Vogue editor Aliona Doletskaya as the next editor of American Vogue.[63] Condé Nast responded by taking out a full-page ad in The New York Times defending her record. In that same publication, Cathy Horyn later wrote that while Wintour hadn't lost her touch, the magazine had become "stale and predictable", as a reader had recently complained. "To read Vogue in recent years is to wonder about the peculiar fascination for the 'villa in Tuscany' story", Horyn added. The magazine also dealt awkwardly with the recession, she commented.[62]
In 2009, Wintour began making more media appearances. On a 60 Minutes profile, she said she would not retire. "To me this is a really interesting time to be in this position and I think it would be in a way irresponsible not to put my best foot forward and lead us into a different time".[64] In September, The September Issue, a documentary film by The War Room producer R.J. Cutler about the production of the September 2007 issue, was released. It focused on the sometimes-difficult relationship between Wintour and creative director Grace Coddington.[65][66] She appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote it,[67] defending the relevance of fashion in a tough economy.[68] The American Society of Magazine Editors elected her to its Hall of Fame in 2010.[69]
In 2013, Condé Nast announced she would be taking on the position of artistic director for the company's magazines while remaining at Vogue. She assumed some of the responsibilities of Si Newhouse, the company's longtime editorial director, who, in his mid-80s at the time, had begun moving from his role at Condé Nast to join the rest of his family in managing Advance Publications, its parent company. A company spokesman told The New York Times the position was created to keep Wintour. She described it as "an extension of what I am doing, but on a broader scale."[70]
On Ovation TV, beginning January 22, 2014, Wintour will star in The Fashion Fund, a documentary about the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund competition. She will be a judge with Diane von Furstenberg, designer and Council of Fashion Designers of America president; Jenna Lyons, J. Crew president; Andrew Rosen, Theory cofounder and chief executive officer; and Ken Downing, fashion director and senior vice present of Neiman Marcus.[71]
On January 14, 2014, the Metropolitan Museum of Art named the Costume Institute complex after Wintour.[72]
Through the years, she has come to be regarded as one of the most powerful people in fashion, setting trends, and anointing new designers. Industry publicists often hear "Do you want me to go to Anna with this?" when they have differences with her subordinates.[73] The Guardian has called her the "unofficial mayoress" of New York City.[74] She has encouraged fashion houses such as Christian Dior to hire younger, fresher designers such as John Galliano.
Her influence extends outside fashion. She persuaded Donald Trump to let Marc Jacobs use a ballroom at the Plaza Hotel for a show when Jacobs and his partner were short of cash. More recently, she persuaded Brooks Brothers to hire the relatively unknown Thom Browne.[73] A protégée at Vogue, Plum Sykes,[52] became a successful novelist, drawing her settings from New York's fashionable élite.[75]
Her salary was reported to be $2 million a year in 2005.[1] In addition, she receives several perks, such as a chauffeured Mercedes S-Class (both in New York and abroad), a $200,000 shopping allowance,[64] and the Coco Chanel Suite at the Hotel Ritz Paris while attending European fashion shows.[39] Condé Nast president S. I. Newhouse also had the company make her an interest-free $1.6 million loan to purchase her townhouse in Greenwich Village.[76]
She had two children by Shaffer following their 1984 marriage: Charles (Charlie) born 1985, and Katherine (known as Bee) born 1987; the latter wrote occasional columns for The Daily Telegraph in 2006,[77] but says she won't follow her mother into fashion.[78] The couple divorced in 1999. Newspapers and gossip columnists claimed her affair with investor Shelby Bryan ended the marriage.[79] She declined to comment.[80][81] Her friends say Bryan has mellowed her. "She smiles now and has been seen to laugh", the Observer quoted one as saying.[82]
Wintour is also a philanthropist. She serves as a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York,[24] where she has organised benefits that have raised $50 million for the museum's Costume Institute.[64] She began the CFDA/Vogue Fund in order to encourage, support and mentor unknown fashion designers. She has also raised over $10 million for AIDS charities since 1990, by organising various high profile benefits.[24]
She claims to rise before 6 am, plays tennis and has her hair and makeup done, then gets to Vogue's offices two hours later. She always arrives at fashion shows well before their scheduled start. "I use the waiting time to make phone calls and notes; I get some of my best ideas at the shows", she says.[77] According to the BBC documentary series Boss Woman, she rarely stays at parties for more than 20 minutes at a time and gets to bed by 10:15 every night.[83] She exerts a great deal of control over the magazine's visual content. Since her first days as editor, she has required that photographers not begin until she has approved Polaroids of the setup and clothing. Afterwards, they must submit all their work to the magazine, not just their personal choices.[84]
Her control over the text is less certain. Her staffers claim she reads everything written for publication,[54][85] but former editor Richard Story has claimed she rarely, if ever, read any of Vogue's arts coverage or book reviews.[86] Earlier in her career, she often left the task of writing the text accompanying her layouts to others; former coworkers claim she has minimal skills in that area.[87] Today, she writes little for the magazine save the monthly editor's letter. She reportedly has three full-time assistants but sometimes surprises callers by answering the phone herself.[88] She often turns her cell phone off in order to eat her lunch, usually a steak (or bunless hamburger),[80] undisturbed.[89] High-protein meals have been a habit of hers for a long time. "It was smoked salmon and scrambled eggs every single day" for lunch, says a coworker at Harpers & Queen. "She would eat nothing else."[23]
Because of her position, Wintour's wardrobe is often closely scrutinised and imitated. Earlier in her career, she mixed fashionable T-shirts and vests with designer jeans. When she started at Vogue as creative director she switched to Chanel suits with miniskirts.[39] She continued to wear them during both pregnancies,[82] opening the skirts slightly in back and keeping her jacket on to cover up.[90] Wintour was listed as "one of the fifty best-dressed over 50s" by the Guardian in March 2013.[91]
According to biographer Jerry Oppenheimer, her ubiquitous sunglasses are actually corrective lenses, since she suffers from deteriorating vision as her father did. A former colleague he interviewed recalls trying on her Wayfarers in her absence and getting dizzy.[92] "I think at this point they've become, you know, really armour", Wintour herself told 60 Minutes correspondent Morley Safer, explaining that they allow her to keep her reactions to a show private.[93] As she rebounded from the end of her marriage and the turnover in the magazine's editorial staff, a fellow editor and friend noted that "she's not hiding behind her glasses anymore. Now she's having fun again."[37]
Wintour has been a supporter of the Democratic Party since Hillary Clinton's 2000 Senate run and John Kerry's 2004 presidential run and serving Barack Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential runs as a "bundler" of contributions. In 2008 and 2012, she co-hosted fundraisers with Sarah Jessica Parker, the latter being a 50-person, $40,000-a-plate dinner at Parker's West Village town house with Meryl Streep, Michael Kors, and Trey Laird, an advertising executive, among the attendees. She has also teamed with Calvin Klein and Harvey Weinstein on fundraisers during Obama's first term and Donna Karan has been amongst the attendees.[94] In 2013 when Vogue's former director of communications stepped down, Wintour was rumored to be looking to hire someone with a political background. Soon after, Wintour hired Hildy Kuryk, a former fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and Obama's first campaign.[95][96]
Lauren Weisberger, a former Wintour assistant[97] who left Vogue for Departures along with Richard Story, wrote The Devil Wears Prada after a writing workshop he suggested she take.[98] It was eagerly anticipated for its supposed insider portrait of Wintour prior to its publication.[99] Wintour told The New York Times, "I always enjoy a great piece of fiction. I haven't decided whether I am going to read it or not."[100] While it has been suggested that the setting and Miranda Priestly were based on Vogue and Wintour, Weisberger claims she drew not only from her own experiences but those of her friends as well.[101] Wintour herself makes a cameo appearance near the end of the book,[102] where it is said she and Miranda dislike each other.[103]
In the novel, Miranda has many similarities to Wintour—among them, she is British, has two children,[104] and is described as a major contributor to the Met.[105] Priestly is a tyrant; who makes impossible demands of her subordinates, gives them almost none of the information or time necessary to comply and then berates them for their failures to do so.[106]
Betts, who had been fired by Harper's after two years during which staffers said she tried too hard to emulate Wintour,[107] reviewed it harshly in the New York Times Book Review:
Having worked at Vogue myself for eight years and having been mentored by Anna Wintour, I have to say Weisberger could have learned a few things in the year she sold her soul to the devil of fashion for $32,500. She had a ringside seat at one of the great editorial franchises in a business that exerts an enormous influence over women, but she seems to have understood almost nothing about the isolation and pressure of the job her boss was doing, or what it might cost a person like Miranda Priestly to become a character like Miranda Priestly.[99]
Priestly has some positive qualities. Andrea notes that she makes all the magazine's key editorial decisions by herself[108] and that she has genuine class and style.[109] "I never for one second didn't know it was an amazing opportunity to assist Anna," Weisberger said in 2008.[110]
The film version of the novel has not been the only movie to have a character borrowing some aspects of Wintour. Edna Mode's similar hairstyle in The Incredibles has been noted,[66][111] Johnny Depp said he partially based the demeanour of Willy Wonka in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory on Wintour.[112] Fey Sommers in the Ugly Betty television series was also likened to Wintour.[113]
During the film's production in 2005, Wintour was reportedly threatening prominent fashion personalities, particularly designers, that Vogue would not cover them if they made cameo appearances in the movie as themselves.[114] She denied it through a spokesperson who said she was interested in anything that "supports fashion". Many designers are mentioned in the film. Only one, Valentino Garavani, appeared as himself.[114]
The film was released, in mid-2006, to great commercial success.[115] Wintour attended the première wearing Prada. In the film, actress Meryl Streep plays a Priestly different enough from the book's to receive critical praise as an entirely original (and more sympathetic) character.[116][117] (Streep's office in the film was similar enough to Wintour's that Wintour reportedly had hers redecorated[118])
Wintour reportedly said the film would probably go straight to DVD.[89] It made over $300 million in worldwide box office receipts. Later in 2006, in an interview with Barbara Walters that aired the day of the DVD's release, Wintour said she found the film "really entertaining" and praised it for making fashion "entertaining and glamorous and interesting ... I was 100 percent behind it."[119]
That opinion of the movie has not yet led her to forgive Weisberger.[120] When it was reported that the novelist's editor told her to start her third novel over, Wintour's spokesman suggested she "should get a job as someone else's assistant."[121]
Oppenheimer suggests The Devil Wears Prada may have done Wintour a favour by increasing her name recognition. "Besides giving Weisberger her fifteen minutes", he says, "[it] ... place[d] Anna squarely in the mainstream celebrity pantheon. [She] was now known and talked about over Big Macs and french fries under the Golden Arches by young fashionistas in Wal-Mart denim in Davenport and Dubuque."[120]
When The September Issue was released three years later, critics compared it with the earlier, fictional film. "For the past year or so, she's been on the media warpath to win back her image", said Paul Schrodt in Slant Magazine.[122] Many considered the question of how similar she was to Streep's Priestly, and praised the film for showing the real person. Manohla Dargis at The New York Times said that Priestly had helped humanise Wintour, and "the documentary continues this."[123] "The movie offers insights that lift it beyond a realist version of The Devil Wears Prada," agreed Mary Pols in Time.[124]
In 2005, two years after The Devil Wears Prada, Oppenheimer's Front Row: The Cool Life and Hot Times of Vogue's Editor in Chief was published. It painted a similar portrait of the real woman. According to Oppenheimer, Wintour not only declined his requests for an interview but discouraged others from talking to him.[125]
Wintour is often described as emotionally distant by those who have come to know her well, even her close friends. "At some stage in her career, Anna Wintour stopped being Anna Wintour and became 'Anna Wintour', at which point, like wings of a stately home, she closed off large sections of her personality to the public", wrote The Guardian.[111] "I think she enjoys not being completely approachable. Just her office is very intimidating. You have to walk about a mile into the office before you get to her desk and I'm sure it's intentional", Coddington says.[64] "I don't find her to be accessible to people she doesn't need to be accessible to", agrees Vogue publisher Tom Florio.[126]
She has said she admired her father Charles, known as "Chilly Charlie"[53][93] for being "inscrutable".[44] Former coworkers told Oppenheimer of a similar aloofness on her part. But she is also known for volatile outbursts of displeasure, and the widely used "Nuclear Wintour" sobriquet is a result of both. She dislikes it enough to have asked The New York Times not to use it.[44] "There are times I get quite angry", she admitted in The September Issue.[127]
"I think she has been very rude to a lot of people in the past, on her way up – very terse", a friend told the Observer. "She doesn't do small talk. She is never going to be friends with her assistant."[82] A former assistant said, "You definitely did not ride the elevator with her."[128] Unwritten rules imposed by Wintour at the Vogue offices forbid junior staffers from initiating conversation with her; an editor who greeted her on the elevator was reprimanded by one of Wintour's assistants (She calls that an exaggeration.[64]). A visiting reporter saw a junior staffer appear visibly panicked when she realised she would have to ride the elevator with Wintour. Once a junior editor saw her trip in the hallway, walked past without offering assistance, and was later told she "did absolutely the right thing."[52]
Even friends admit to some trepidation in her presence. "Anna happens to be a friend of mine", says Barbara Amiel, "a fact which is of absolutely no help in coping with the cold panic that grips me whenever we meet."[89] "I know when to stop pushing her", says Coddington. "She doesn't know when to stop pushing me".[129]
She has often been described as a perfectionist who routinely makes impossible, arbitrary demands of subordinates: "kitchen scissors at work", in the words of one commentator.[34] She once made a junior staffer look through a photographer's trash to find a picture he had refused to give her.[32] In a deleted scene from The September Issue, she complains about the "horrible white plastic buckets" of ice behind the bars at the CFDA's 7th on Sale AIDS benefit and moves them out of sight.[130] "The notion that Anna would want something done 'now' and not 'shortly' is accurate", Amiel says of The Devil Wears Prada. "Anna wants what she wants right away."[131] A longtime assistant says, "She throws you in the water and you'll either sink or swim."[132]
Peter Braunstein, the former Women's Wear Daily media reporter, later convicted of sexually assaulting a coworker, allegedly planned to kill Wintour because of perceived slights. After receiving only one ticket to the 2002 Vogue Fashion Awards, which he perceived as a snub, he became so angry that WWD fired him.[133] At his 2007 trial, prosecutors introduced as evidence a journal he kept on his computer in which he stated his intention to kill her. In it he wrote, "She just never talked to peons like us" to justify his intended actions.[134]
On one occasion, she has had to pay for her treatment of employees. In 2004, a court ruled that she and Shaffer were to pay $104,403, and Wintour herself an additional $32,639, to settle a lawsuit brought against them by the New York State Workers' Compensation Board. They had failed to pay the $140,000 judgement it incurred on behalf of a former employee injured on the job, who did not have the necessary insurance coverage.[135]
In the 2000s, her relationship with Bryan was credited with softening her personality at work. "Even when she's in a bad mood, she has a different posture", someone described as a "Wintour watcher" told the New York Observer. "The consensus is that she's so much more mellow and easier to work for because she's probably getting laid."[54]
She has often been the target of animal rights organisations like PETA, who are angered by her use of fur in Vogue, her pro-fur editorials and her refusal to run paid advertisements from animal rights organisations. Undeterred, she continues to use fur in photo spreads, saying there's always a way to wear it.[136] "Nobody was wearing fur until she put it on the cover in the early 1990s", says Vogue co-worker Tom Florio. "She ignited the entire industry."[137]
She has "lost count" of the times she has been physically attacked by activists.[138] In Paris in October 2005, she was hit with a tofu pie while waiting to get into the Chloé show.[139] On another occasion, an activist dumped a dead raccoon on her plate at a restaurant; she told the waiter to remove it.[80] She and Vogue publisher Ron Galotti once retaliated for a protest outside the Condé Nast offices during the company's annual Christmas party by sending down a plate of roast beef.[140]
Others outside of the animal-rights community have raised the fur issue. Peter Braunstein wrote in his manifesto that she would go to a hell guarded by large rats, where it would be so warm she wouldn't need to wear fur.[141] Pamela Anderson, in an early 2008 interview, said Wintour was the living person she most despised "because she bullies young designers and models to use and wear fur."[142]
Another common criticism of Wintour's editorship focuses on Vogue's increasing use of celebrities on the cover, and her insistence on making them meet her standards.[34][82][143][144] She reportedly told Oprah Winfrey to lose weight before her cover photograph. Likewise, Hillary Clinton was told not to wear a blue suit.[34] At the 2005 Anglomania celebration, a Vogue-sponsored salute to British fashion at the Met, Wintour is said to have personally chosen the clothes for prominent attendees such as Jennifer Lopez, Kate Moss, Donald Trump, and Diane von Fürstenberg.[82] "I don't think Vreeland had that kind of concentration", says WWD publisher Patrick McCarthy. "She wouldn't have dressed Babe Paley. Nor would Babe Paley have let her." By persuading designers to loan clothes to prominent socialites and celebrities, who are then photographed wearing the clothes not only in Vogue but more general-interest magazines like People and Us, which in turn influence what buyers want, some in the industry believe Wintour is exerting too much control over it, especially since she is not involved in making or producing clothes herself. "The end result is that Anna can control it all the way to the selling floor", says Candy Pratts Price, executive fashion director at style.com.[88] She has been credited with killing grunge fashion in the early 1990s, when it wasn't selling well, by telling designers if they continued to avoid glamour their looks would not be photographed for Vogue. All complied.[37]
Wintour (photographed by Ed Kavishe of Fashion Wire Press) often insists on being seated apart from other fashion editors at shows.
Another Vogue writer has complained Wintour excluded ordinary working women, many of whom are regular subscribers, from the pages. "She's obsessed only about reflecting the aspirations of a certain class of reader", she says. "We once had a piece about breast cancer which started with an airline stewardess, but she wouldn't have a stewardess in the magazine so we had to go and look for a high-flying businesswoman who'd had cancer."[34]
Wintour has been accused of setting herself apart even from peers. "I do not think fiction could surpass the reality", a British fashion magazine editor says of The Devil Wears Prada. "[A]rt in this instance is only a poor imitation of life." Wintour, the editor says, routinely requests to be seated out of sight of competing editors at shows. "We spend our working lives telling people which it-bag to carry but Anna is so above the rest of us she does not even have a handbag."[82]
At the 2008 Milan Fashion Week she requested that some key shows be rescheduled for earlier in the week so she and other U.S.-based editors could have time to return home before the Paris shows. This led to complaints. Other editors said they had to rush through the earlier shows, and lesser-known designers who had to show later were denied an important audience. Dolce & Gabbana said Italian fashion was getting short shrift and Milan was becoming a "circus without sense."[145]
Giorgio Armani, who at the time was co-chairing a Met exhibition on superheroes' costumes with Wintour, drew some attention for his cutting personal remarks. "Maybe what she thinks is a beautiful dress, I wouldn't think was a beautiful dress", he said. While he claimed he couldn't understand why people disliked her, saying he himself was indifferent, he expressed hope she hadn't made a comment once attributed to her "the Armani era is over." He accused her of preferring French and American fashion over Italian.[146] Geoffrey Beene, who stopped inviting Wintour to shows after she stopped writing about him, called her "a boss lady in four-wheel drive who ignores or abandons those who do not fuel her tank. As an editor, she has turned class into mass, taste into waste".[37]
Her remarks about obesity have caused controversy on more than one occasion. In 2005, Wintour was heavily criticised by the New York chapter of the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance after Vogue editor-at-large André Leon Talley said on The Oprah Winfrey Show, at one point, Wintour demanded he lose weight. "Most of the Vogue girls are so thin, tremendously thin" he said, "because Miss Anna doesn't like fat people."[147] In 2009, residents of Minneapolis took umbrage after she told 60 Minutes she could "only kindly describe most of the people I saw as little houses." They noted their city had been named the third fittest in the nation that year by Men's Fitness while New York had been named the fifth fattest.[148]
Defenses of Wintour have often come from others. Amanda Fortini at Slate said she was comfortable with Wintour's elitism since that was intrinsic to fashion:
Most of us read Vogue not with the intention of buying the wildly expensive clothes, but because doing so educates our eye and hones our taste, similar to the way eating gourmet food refines the palate. This is a pleasure enabled by Wintour's ruthless aesthetic, her refusal to participate in the democratizing tendency of most of her competitors. To deny her that privilege is to deny her readers the privilege of fantasy in the form of beautifully photographed Paris couture.[34]
Emma Brockes sees this in Wintour herself: "[Her] unwavering ability to look as if she lives within the pages of her magazine has a sort of honesty to it, proof that, whatever one thinks about it, the lifestyle peddled by Vogue is at least physically possible."[111]
Some friends see her purported coldness as just traditional British reserve,[131] or shyness.[52] Brockes says it may be mutual, "partly a reflection of how awkward people are with her, particularly women, who get preemptively chippy when faced with the prospect of meeting Fashion Incarnate."[111] Wintour describes herself as shy, and Harry Connick Jr., who escorted her and Bee to shows in 2007, agrees.[149] When Morley Safer asked her about complaints about her personality, she said
I have so many people here, Morley, that have worked with me for 15, 20 years, and, you know, if I'm such a bitch, they must really be a glutton for punishment because they're still here ... If one comes across sometimes as being cold or brusque, it's simply because I'm striving for the best.[64]
She has made similar statements in defence of her reported refusal to hire fat people. "It's important to me that the people that are working here, particularly in the fashion department", she says, "will present themselves in a way that makes sense to the outside world that they work at Vogue."[52]
Her defenders have called criticism sexist. "Powerful women in the media always get inspected more thoroughly than their male counterparts", said The New York Times in a piece about Wintour shortly after The Devil Wears Prada's release.[150] When she took over at Vogue, gossip columnist Liz Smith reported rumours she had gotten the job through an affair with Si Newhouse. A reportedly furious Wintour made her anger the subject of one of her first staff meetings.[32] She still complained about it when accepting a media award in 2002.[151]
She has been called a feminist whose changes to Vogue have reflected, acknowledged, and reinforced advances in the status of women. Reviewing Oppenheimer's book in The Washington Monthly, managing editor Christina Larson notes Vogue, unlike many other women's magazines,
...doesn't play to its readership's sense of inadequacy ... Instead, it reminds women to take satisfaction, parading all manner of fineries (clothes, furniture, travel destinations) that a successful woman might buy, or at least admire. While it surely exists to sell ads ... it does so primarily by exploiting ambition, not insecurity.[32]
Wintour, unlike Vreeland, "...shifted Vogue's focus from the cult of beauty to the cult of the creation of beauty".[32] To her, the focus on celebrities is a welcome development as it means women are making the cover of Vogue at least in part for what they have accomplished, not just how they look.[32]
Complaints about her role as fashion eminence grise are dismissed by those familiar with how she actually exercises it. "She's honest. She tells you what she thinks. Yes is yes and no is no", according to Karl Lagerfeld. "She's not too pushy" agrees François-Henri Pinault, chief executive officer of PPR, Gucci's parent company. "She lets you know it's not a problem if you can't do something she wants." Defenders also point out she continued supporting Gucci despite her strong belief PPR should not have let Tom Ford go. Designers such as Alice Roi and Isabel Toledo have flourished without indulging Wintour or Vogue.[88] Her willingness to throw her weight around has helped keep Vogue independent despite its heavy reliance on advertising dollars. Wintour was the only fashion editor who refused to follow an Armani ultimatum to feature more of its clothes in the magazine's editorial pages,[82] although she has also admitted if she has to choose between two dresses, one by an advertiser and the other not, she will choose the former every time. "Commercial is not a dirty word to me".[37]
Wintour herself, when asked about it, dismisses the notion that she has all the power attributed to her. "I don't think of myself as a powerful person," she told Forbes in 2011, when it named her 69th on its list of the world's hundred most powerful women. "You know, what does it mean? It means you get a better seat in a restaurant or tickets to a screening or whatever it may be. But it is a wonderful opportunity to be able to help others, and for that I'm extremely grateful."[152]
In response to criticisms like Beene's, she has defended the democratisation of what were once exclusive luxury brands. "It means more people are going to get better fashion", she told Dana Thomas. "And the more people who can have fashion, the better".[153]

																				Anna Wintour's Salary And Other Facts You Might Not Know About The Vogue Editor (PHOTOS)

You've read The Devil Wears Prada and watched "The September Issue," so you basically know everything about Anna Wintour, right?
Not necessarily. We've taken a closer look at the world's most famous fashion editor and dug up some facts that often go unmentioned. Herewith, 9 things you might not have known about Vogue's editor-in-chief: 
According to New York magazine's salary guide, released in 2011. Now that she also serves as artistic director over all of Conde Nast, we bet that number is even higher.
According to her friend Barbara Amiel, who wrote about her in the Telegraph, Anna manages to be "persuasively sexual without obvious flash when she dances, which she does with a vengeance and irritatingly well." Who knew?
"I recommend that you all get fired. It's a great learning experience," Anna once told the Independent. She was sacked from the fashion mag in 1975 for pushing the envelope, styling models for a Parisian couture shoot with dreadlocks. "It was too much for them," she later told Hemispheres magazine. "That was the end of me at Harper’s Bazaar."
Menkes, the famed International Herald Tribune fashion critic, was actually recruited by Anna's father, Charles Wintour, then an editor at the London Evening Standard. Because of that, her friendship with Anna Wintour actually goes way back -- at a talk in May 2013, Menkes said she attended Anna's 21st birthday party.
She was brought in in 1987 to revamp the magazine, and she immediately upped the glam factor by putting models on the magazine pages. The changes were so drastic the press came to jokingly refer to the publication as "House & Garment."
Writer Martin Filler once recalled an incident in which Wintour, then at House & Garden, criticized his writing style. "You use too many adjectives," she said. "I don't like adjectives. That's all." (Emphasis ours!)
Anna's daughter, 25-year-old Bee Shaffer, often accompanies her to fashion shows and the annual Met Gala. But her son, Charlie, avoids the spotlight and is rarely seen at his mother's stylish events.

=======================================================
Photograph by Steve Eichner. Published in WWD, May 2, 2011.“Vogue is a fashion magazine, and a fashion magazine is about change,”⁠[1] Anna Wintour, its legendary editor in chief, said not long after taking one of publishing’s most storied posts in 1988. Her first cover said it all: After years of static studio close-ups of perfectly coiffed models,⁠ she chose an image of a fresh-faced, tousle-haired nineteen-year-old, laughing as she walked in the sun in a $10,000 jewel-encrusted Christian Lacroix jacket and a pair of Guess jeans. 
Wintour’s mix of high and low fashion was, at the time, totally eyebrow-raising. “I remember the printers called us up because they thought we’d made a mistake,” she later said. “Just wanting to check that that actually was the cover.”[2]
In the years since, Wintour has continued to redefine and reinvent the fashion magazine. One of her most-commented-upon innovations was to bring movie stars and singers to Vogue’s covers, while other publications remained fixated on models. “I remember getting quite a bit of criticism for my first Madonna cover,⁠”[3] she said in 2011, recalling the singer’s 1989 appearance. During the nineties, all of Hollywood’s most beautiful and sought-after faces—including Winona Ryder, Gwyneth Paltrow, Julia Roberts, Demi Moore, and Renée Zellweger—appeared on the cover.⁠ Oprah Winfrey, the talk-television titan, joined them in 1998, as did First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton that same year. “I don’t really follow market research,” Wintour later said. “In the end I respond to my own instincts.”[4]
Wintour’s instincts were honed in the late sixties, the heady days of Swinging London. After a “totally undistinguished”[5] school career, as she herself put it, she bypassed university to work as a fashion editor at Harpers & Queen. Journalism was in her blood: Her father, Charles Wintour, was editor of the Evening Standard newspaper. She arrived in New York in the late seventies, and joined the masthead of New York magazine in 1981; then, in 1983, was named Vogue’s creative director.⁠ She bounced back to England for a brief tenure as editor in chief of British Vogue, during which she transformed the “quirky, insular fashion magazine to a slicker international publication,”[6] according to The New York Times.⁠ Condé Nast brought Wintour back to New York to head up the staid House & Garden—but then, only ten months later, moved her over into what is perhaps publishing’s plummiest position: editor in chief of Vogue.
Behind the scenes, Wintour stokes designers’ creativity, while letting them know what women really want. She nurtured the early careers of Michael Kors, Alexander McQueen, Marc Jacobs, John Galliano, and Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough of Proenza Schouler, among many others. ⁠In 2003, she initiated a plan to lend a helping hand to Manhattan’s young talents—still struggling in the wake of 9/11—through the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund: With a multimillion-dollar endowment and star-studded mentorship program, it has become an invaluable ladder up which new designers can climb to the top. “The Fashion Fund celebrates the real passion that underlies the fashion business,” Wintour wrote in 2004, “not the frothy world of glamour and celebrity that so often surrounds it.”[7]
Since the late eighties, when AIDS struck the heart of the fashion community, Wintour has raised awareness, and much needed funds, for medical research and related services. “We at Vogue and all those in the fashion industry have lost many beloved and talented friends,”[8] she wrote in 1990. The magazine joined forces with the designers and manufacturers of Seventh Avenue to promote Seventh on Sale, a mammoth fund-raising sample sale. In 1999, Wintour organized a major auction of Oscar gowns to benefit amfAR.
In much the same way, she harnessed Vogue’s might to support the fashion industry during the economic slump of 2009. “A lot of people were complaining,” she said, “but people weren’t really doing anything about it.”⁠[9] She proposed Fashion’s Night Out, a one-night festival of style and commerce, from New York to cities across the globe. In the first year of its four-year run, 800 stores participated,⁠ with legions of celebrities drawing after-hours shoppers by the hordes (“It was the first shot in the arm we had seen,”[10] a Macy’s executive said). Twelve months later, 1,000 stores in New York alone signed on, as did retailers in 100 American cities and sixteen countries worldwide;⁠ Istanbul shoppers spent $2 million in just three hours. 
Another beneficiary of Wintour’s make-it-happen spirit has been the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which she has championed since becoming cochair of the yearly benefit gala in 1995. Wintour has helped raise some $125 million for this hallowed repository of fashion history, which was revamped and renamed the Anna Wintour Costume Center in 2014. 
Along the way, her mounting influence has fueled curiosity about the powerful woman at Vogue’s helm. She’s become a celebrity in her own right—though a rather reluctant one. “She has the star quality,”[11] the designer Oscar de la Renta once said. Wintour became famous for her trademark bob and her inscrutable gaze from behind a pair of dark sunglasses—as well as for her editorial instincts, her decisiveness, and her work ethic. “I’m horribly hands-on, I’m afraid,” she once said. “I like to read every caption.”[12] While the public encountered a fictionalized fashion editor in chief in the 2003 novel The Devil Wears Prada, they got a close-up look at the real-life editor in the documentary The September Issue, which followed Wintour and her team through the production of 2007’s 840-page bible, at the time the biggest in Vogue’s history. 
“Anna is driven by a desire to express herself as an editor,” said Si Newhouse, Condé Nast’s chairman and Wintour’s boss. “I don’t think she thinks of herself as having a job any more than Baryshnikov thinks of himself as having a job.”[13]
Among her off-the-job passions are tennis and theater . . . but these have, naturally, spilled over onto the pages of the magazine. Her fascination with politics has brought Vogue close to Washington’s epicenter: She supported Barack Obama’s presidential fund-raising efforts in 2008 and 2012, and put First Lady Michelle Obama on the Power Issue cover in March 2009, and once more in 2013.⁠
Vogue’s reach and depth and influence have all expanded exponentially during the Wintour years. And she has continued to broaden her vision: In 2013, Wintour added to her long list of roles the title of artistic director of Condé Nast, while continuing to steer the grand ship that is Vogue. “Vogue is like Nike or Coca-Cola—this huge global brand,” she said in 2011. “I want to enhance it, I want to protect it, and I want it to be part of the conversation.”⁠[14]
Anna Wintour born in London. Her American mother, Elinor Wintour (known as Nonie), is a philanthropist. Her English father, Charles Wintour, is a journalist who will become editor of the Evening Standard. Anna will gain her social conscience from her mother, and from her father an “excitement about the news,” as she will later put it. “One holiday was ruined by Marilyn Monroe’s death. My father had to rush us back from Venice.”[15]
Joins Harpers & Queen in London as deputy fashion editor, where she will produce a much-talked-about fashion shoot reimagining Impressionist masterworks by Manet and Renoir with models wearing fringe and go-go boots.⁠
Moves to New York, where she is named a junior fashion editor at Harper’s Bazaar⁠. Fired nine months later for not “understanding American fashion,”[16] as she later puts it.
Thrives as a senior editor of fashion and interiors at New York magazine. “Here was a magazine that was about the most sophisticated city in the world, the most modern, the most aware, the place where most things happen—I learned so much,⁠”[17] she will later say. Mixes art with fashion, commissioning the city’s top artists to design backdrops for her shoots⁠. Gains a reputation as an innovator.
Wooed by fabled Condé Nast editor Alexander Liberman, comes to Vogue as creative director,⁠ a newly created position.
First child Charlie Shaffer born.⁠ Returns to London as editor in chief of British Vogue. Tells an English reporter, “I want Vogue to be pacy, sharp, and sexy.”⁠[18] On one photo shoot, finding the skirts are the wrong length, she works them over with scissors; the story becomes the stuff of urban legend. “It happened—once,”[19] she later admits, laughing.⁠
Daughter Bee Shaffer born.⁠ Condé Nast lures Wintour back to New York to helm the sleepy House & Garden (she will change its name to HG the following year). Her radical redesign confuses some advertisers. “A magazine is like a close friend—if she turns up with a new haircut, it’s a shock. It was the same with HG,” Wintour will later explain. “One of my biggest professional regrets is that I didn’t have a chance to develop the magazine, to have people get over the shock.”[20]
Named Vogue’s editor in chief. Shakes things up. “Vogue at the time felt too mired down in a very conservative look,”[21] Condé Nast chairman Si Newhouse will later say. Wintour’s famous first cover shows a model in a bejeweled couture jacket and blue jeans.
Throws Vogue’s support behind Seventh on Sale, a sprawling designer sample sale to benefit AIDS research.
The Met Costume Institute gala is now known as the pinnacle of New York’s social calendar, drawing socialites, politicians, designers, and major Hollywood stars.
Steers the VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards, broadcast live from the Sixty-ninth Regiment Armory with an in-house audience of 1,200⁠ that includes Tom Ford and Donatella Versace, Faith Hill and Puffy Combs.
Joins forces to create the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, spurring the careers of young designers including Alexander Wang, Proenza Schouler’s Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, Thakoon Panichgul of Thakoon, and Prabal Gurung. Extends the brand, overseeing the launch of Teen Vogue⁠. Men’s Vogue⁠ and Vogue Living⁠ will follow.
Produces Fashion Rocks, a music supplement to Vogue, published to coincide with the televised concert of the same name, which kicks off New York fashion week. The show raises funds for the Elton John AIDS Foundation, and is headlined by John, Kanye West, Christina Aguilera, and Beyoncé Knowles.⁠
Accepts the Order of the British Empire from Queen Elizabeth,⁠ in recognition of her services to the British fashion industry in the U.S.
Instigates the first Fashion’s Night Out event, to support retailers and designers during the Great Recession. “It encouraged people to enjoy the stores that dot their streets,” she writes. “And it was just plain fun to see New Yorkers of every stripe out and about and looking fabulous.”⁠[22]
Becomes a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she has chaired thirteen benefits since 1995. Receives the Légion d’Honneur medal from French president Nicolas Sarkozy while wearing a Chanel couture suit that debuted on the runway the night before.
Celebrates the one hundred twentieth anniversary of Vogue with the biggest issue in its history, at 916 pages.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art christens the Anna Wintour Costume Center, a newly redesigned space that incorporates the old Costume Institute’s exhibition gallery, library, and research center. The Fashion Fund, a behind-the-scenes documentary of the CFDA/Vogue competition, airs on Ovation TV.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Anna Wintour is the daughter of Charles Wintour, former Editor of the Evening Standard. She started her career in 1970, working in the fashion department at Harpers & Queen in London. Six years later, she joined its sister New York publication Harper's Bazaar as its Fashion Editor. After a stint as Senior Editor at New York magazine, controlling the title's fashion and lifestyle coverage, Wintour was named Creative Director of American Vogue in 1983. British Vogue hired her back as Editor in Chief for two years. In 1988, she rejoined American Vogue as Editor-in-Chief and in that capacity, has helped raise over $10 million for AIDS charities since 1990.Like her image, Wintour's daily regime is legendary. Now based in Manhattan, she wakes up at 5:45am every morning, plays tennis for an hour before being professionally made-up, coiffed and chauffeured to the offices of American Vogue. Though one of New York's most prolific party throwers, she never stays at any one event for more than the first ten minutes, preferring to be in bed by 10pm.
      Has two children with David Shaffer, Charles "Charlie" (b. 1987) and Katherine "Bee" (b. 1989).
      Has often been the target of various animal rights organizations such as P.E.T.A. due to her use of fur in "Vogue".
      Reportedly warned major fashion designers that they would be banished from "Vogue"'s pages if they make cameo appearances on The Devil Wears Prada (2006) because the character of "Miranda Priestly", played by Meryl Streep, is believed to be based on her.
      Her former assistant Lauren Weisberger (1999-2000) wrote the book "The Devil Wears Prada", which was a thinly veiled account of the hellish life of a fashion magazine editor's assistant and is based upon Weisberger's own experiences. The main character Miranda Priestly is supposedly based upon Wintour. The book was eventually made into the movie The Devil Wears Prada (2006).
      Showed a good sense of humor when she attended the premiere of The Devil Wears Prada (2006) wearing Prada.
      She was awarded the OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2008 Queen's Birthday Honors List for her services to British journalism and British fashion in the USA.
=======================================================
Anna Wintour was born on November 3, 1949. The native Brit became an international fashion icon thanks to her role as editor-in-chief of the highly-influential Vogue magazine.
At the age of 15, Wintour debuted her now signature bob haircut; she later dropped out of high school to become a party of the London party circuit. Years later, Wintour entered the fashion world when she scored a job at Harper's & Queen in London. In 1976, she moved to New York City and took over as fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar.
Wintour has also held positions at Viva, Savvy, New York Magazine, British Vogue and Home and Garden. In 1988, she was named editor-in-chief of Vogue.
Nicknamed "Nuclear Wintour," the editor's icy demeanor reportedly inspired the 2003 novel The Devil Wears Prada (which was adapted for the big screen in 2006). Wintour was also the feature of a 2009 documentary, The September Issue.
Wintour -- who serves as a trustee of NYC's Metropolitan Museum of Art -- has two children with ex-husband David Shaffer: son Charles and daughter Katherine (known as Bee). She is currently dating businessman Shelby Bryan. 
=======================================================
Anna Wintour has held the position of Editor-in-Chief of Vogue since July 1988, and was named Artistic Director of Condé Nast in March 2013.  In addition to editing Vogue, Ms. Wintour executed the development and successful launch of Teen Vogue in 2001, and serves as Editorial Director for the title.
During her tenure at Vogue Ms. Wintour has been actively involved in philanthropic fundraising, particularly for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute, for which she has raised more than $100 million. She has been the recipient of numerous awards for her leadership and charitable efforts, including the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Award of Courage for AIDS Research from the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amFAR).
In 2008, for her service to British journalism and fashion, Ms. Wintour was appointed to the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II. In October 2009, President Obama appointed Ms. Wintour to the President’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities. Most recently, in 2011 she was awarded the Legion d’Honneur by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.  Ms. Wintour also serves as an Elective Trustee of The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

From the New York Times bestselling author of Just Desserts: Martha Stewart: The Unauthorized Biography comes a scrupulously researched investigative biography that tells the inside story of Anna Wintour's incredible rise to powerFrom her exclusive perch front row center, glamorous Vogue magazine editor in chief Anna Wintour is the most powerful and influential style-maker in the world. Behind her trademark sunglasses and under the fringe of her Louise Brooks bob she determines whether miniskirts are in or out, whether or not it's politically correct to wear fur. She influences designers, wholesalers, and retailers globally from Seventh Avenue to the elegant fashionista enclaves of L'Avenue Montaigne and Via della Spiga. In the U.S. alone a more than $200 billion fashion industry can rise or fall on Anna Wintour's call. And every month millions of women-and men-read Vogue, and are influenced by the pages of the chic and trendy style wish-book that she has controlled with an iron hand in a not-always-so-velvet glove since fighting her way to the most prestigious job in fashion journalism.Anna Wintour's fashion influence extends to celebrities and politicians: because of it, Hillary Clinton underwent a drastic makeover and became the first First Lady to strike a pose on the cover of Vogue in the midst of Monicagate; Oprah Winfrey was forced to go on a strict diet before Wintour would put her on Vogue's cover. And beauties like Rene Zellweger and Nicole Kidman follow Anna Wintour's fashionista rules to the letter.Now in her mid-fifties, as she nears her remarkable second decade at the helm of Vogue, comes this revealing biography that will shock and surprise both Anna's fans and detractors alike. Based on scores of interviews, Front Row unveils the Anna Wintour even those closest to her don't know. Oppenheimer chronicles this insecure and creative powerhouse's climb to the top of the bitchy, competitive fashion magazine world, showing up close, as never before exposed, how she artfully crafted and reinvented herself along the way. She's been called many things-"Nuclear Wintour," by the British press, "cold suspicious and autocratic, a vision in skinniness," by Grace Mirabella, the editor she dethroned at Vogue, and the "Devil" by those who believe she's the inspiration for a recent bestselling novel written by a former assistant.Included among the startling revelations in Front Row are: * Anna's "silver spoon" childhood spent craving time with her father. * Anna's rebellious teen years in London, obsessed with fashion, night-clubbing and dating roguish men. * Anna's many tempestuous romances. * Anna's curious marriage to a brilliant child psychiatrist, her role as a mother, and the shocking scandal that led to divorce when she had an affair with a married man.(less)

Front Row taught me several important things about life:1. Biographers don't have to be skilled in the fine craft of prose whatsoever.2. Likewise, obscure distant friends and relatives pay no mind to the poor grammar they use when describing someone they have harbored a grudge against for several years.3.

The nitty-gritty details of even the most fascinating person's life are rarely interesting enough even for bathroom reading.4. I need to get famous enough to have a biography written about me.5. Finally, the general public may not be aware of the word "biography" at all.  Example: When riding the train, a young man asked me what I was reading.  I showed him the cover.  "An autobiography?" he asked.  "No," I said. "A biography."  "Oh," he said.  "What's it about?"Anyways, I'm not interested in striking up a friendship with a "world-traveling" reggae band frontman who can't read.  I hate reggae.  And you must read.Also, Anna Wintour is an awesome bitch.(less)
Ugh.  I was so excited to see a biography on Anna Wintour, I ordered it immediately.  But I had no idea it was written by Jerry Oppenheimer, the king of unauthorized biographies like "Martha Stewart: Just Desserts" and "State of a Union: the Complex Marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton".

If this book was read in court, the "heresay" and "conjecture" objections would becoming deafening.It may be good for some basic background info on the fairly private Wintour, but only if you can get by nauseating comments like "not until she was fully swathed in Chanel and standing in stillettos at the helm of the world's fashion bible would Anna fully live up to her uniform" (when discussing her school uniform on page 16, the second such reference to Chanel in 3 pages).   Ugh.(less)
My own version of this book was picked up in New York and, whereas the cover shown here might lead you to believe it could pass for a sophisticated read, mine is something resembling a National Enquirer cover so I went into the whole shebang knowing it was going to be a trashy ride.

My own version of this book was picked up in New York and, whereas the cover shown here might lead you to believe it could pass for a sophisticated read, mine is something resembling a National Enquirer cover so I went into the whole shebang knowing it was going to be a trashy ride. An 'unauthorised' biography, it's quite a salacious tale charting Anna's childhood and career and featuring interviews with embittered former friends and colleagues. Needless to say some of it is vague and wooly, with gossipy rumours thrown about like fact, but for the most part it's quite well researched.This isn't a classy read. You know that and I know that, but as soon as you make peace with that fact you can switch your brain off and accept that is is shamefully entertaining. If you like that kind of thing. (less)
I tend to like to hear about the rich and horrible, most likely just to feel better about myself as a person.  I think my interest in AW comes from Gawker's frequent mentions, and so I wanted to get some more background. This book is wonderfully trashy and tawdry and inspires me to both read his other book on Martha Stewart and to anxiously await the DVD release of the September Issue, a documentary about putting together Vogue's September issue.  
A book that is very challenging to read what with all the names that are mentioned, however, if you liked the story behind The Devil Wears Prada, then this book will intrigue.  I read it first, and it's amazing what similarities you will find in addition to the sheer madness of this fashion icon.
This is possibly the worse written book. I'm so glad I didn't buy it and waste my money on it, instead I borrowed it from the library. It was interesting to learn more about her life though. 
Her majesty Anna Wintour truly deserves to be revered, respected and perhaps worshipped. As the current Editor in Chief of Vogue (the holy grail/bible of fashion world). Although I could never fit anything from its pages I appreciate fashion and the work that goes into bringing to the world. This book gives us insight into her world, her upbringing and how get got to where she is today.

Her majesty Anna Wintour truly deserves to be revered, respected and perhaps worshipped. As the current Editor in Chief of Vogue (the holy grail/bible of fashion world). Although I could never fit anything from its pages I appreciate fashion and the work that goes into bringing to the world. This book gives us insight into her world, her upbringing and how get got to where she is today. That being said I did not really like how this was written the author wrote it from others point of view and dropped a lot of famous and infamous names. Sprinkled throughout he book are statements from Anna but somehow I doubt she actually said them or maybe it was hear say.  I didn't like that, a lot was also from the perspective of her childhood best friend even though they had lost touch over the years. A main focus of the book is Anna's sexually exploits from her teenage years, her relationship with older men and 'hinted' that was essentially how she got to where she is now.I personally would have preferred if this was an autobiography written by her it would give us truer insight into this amazing woman's life and work. September Issue which is on DVD and Netflix gives a rare glimpse into her life and preparation for a September Issue of Vogue. I've watched it multiple times. (less)
Meticulously researched, this unauthorized biography plods through Wintour's life in a repetitive and somewhat boring fashion. I lost count of the many times the author referenced "nuclear Wintour" and "the Wintour of our discontent." What I got out of it, is that I'm certain that Anna Wintour is someone who I would absolutely loathe. She's bitchy and rude to all females, but simpers helplessly for men, like a little lost puppy. Apparently she's quite the seductress, having had plenty of affairs...more
Meticulously researched, this unauthorized biography plods through Wintour's life in a repetitive and somewhat boring fashion. I lost count of the many times the author referenced "nuclear Wintour" and "the Wintour of our discontent." What I got out of it, is that I'm certain that Anna Wintour is someone who I would absolutely loathe. She's bitchy and rude to all females, but simpers helplessly for men, like a little lost puppy. Apparently she's quite the seductress, having had plenty of affairs over the years. I would have loved more information about Andre Leon Talley. How did they meet? How did Wintour come to take him under her wing? I hadn't realized that Wintour had grown up in London, and reading about that chapter of her life was interesting. Readers can extrapolate a few things about Wintour's motivations: why is she so horrid? She grew up in a cold and loveless family and her older brother tragically died at a young age. Why does she wear dark glasses day and night? She suffers from a hereditary eye condition and is terrified of losing her eyesight. Also, she is vain enough not to want to wear regular glasses, and feels that prescription sunglasses are more fashionable.For a book about such a visually motivated person, there were very few pictures included. The book reads like a solid wall of text, with rehashes of newspaper articles and quotes from interviewees. I would have appreciated double or even triple the number of photos, preferably in color.Read The Devil Wears Prada instead. It may be fictionalized, but it still sounds pretty close to the truth, and it's far more entertaining to boot.(less)

Wintour's adolescent rebellion, her parents' divorce, her many boyfriends, and her failure ever to graduate from college.

Joyfully vicious biography of a New York fashion icon. Five decades of ruthlessness leading to huge professional success and crashing personal failures. Oppenheimer starts with Wintour's family. Wintour's adolescent rebellion, her parents' divorce, her many boyfriends, and her failure ever to graduate from college. At early jobs, she was miles ahead of the other girls in terms of ambition and style, as well as of cruelty; more than one coworker also recalls that she couldn't write copy for her fashion spreads. The story winds up presenting Anna at American Voguetwisting S.I. Newhouse around her little finger. Her innovative styling is well documented, as is her technique of assimilating magazine staff (her once-trusted, recently sabotaged personal assistant was happy to discuss specifics with the author). In fact, the number of sources willing to be interviewed and quoted by name is the best indication of Wintour's ability to command loyalty. Those looking for fashion-world dish won't be disapointed by the eat-your-own lifestyle world. As malevolent and superficial as the eponymously titled biography.

While Anna Wintour is a very interesting subject (I first became fascinated with her after seeing the documentary "The September Issue"), I thought that this biography was deeply lacking Anna's own voice. The author explains in the introduction that Anna refused to let him interview her or to be part of the biography in any way, which left his "hundreds of hours of interviews" to be from those who did not get Anna's sanctioned approval, i.e., those who had limited interaction with Anna, or had a...more
While Anna Wintour is a very interesting subject (I first became fascinated with her after seeing the documentary "The September Issue"), I thought that this biography was deeply lacking Anna's own voice. The author explains in the introduction that Anna refused to let him interview her or to be part of the biography in any way, which left his "hundreds of hours of interviews" to be from those who did not get Anna's sanctioned approval, i.e., those who had limited interaction with Anna, or had a negative experience with Anna, or who knew Anna a long time ago, long before she became editor in chief of Vogue. The result is a lot of speculation and surmising, as well as armchair psychology, which, instead of revealing the Anna Wintour beyond the ice queen myth, rather enhances the myth with tales of fear, hurt feelings, and bitter confusion. Threaded throughout the biography is the author's own horrible cliches, trying to create a patchwork biography that reads like a Sex and the City episode. There are many references to the show, so-and-so is like a Carrie, so-and-so was her Mr. Big, even the typeface of the chapters mimics the episode title cards. I thought it cheapened the biography as a whole, as if the only women in New York City MUST be like Sex and the City, and the writing left much to be desired. In fact, if Anna Wintour wasn't such an enigma in her own right, the book would be hopelessly unreadable.  (less)
A great gossipy read is this biography of the now legendary Vogue editor and stalwart of modern day fashion. It certainly had me immersed, if the the 'he said, she said' prose is a little tiring at times. This is a great light hearted read and source for anyone interested in not just the culture, but whole philosophical side of personality and the idea of celebrity. I suppose I fall into the category the book mentions of where women are normally at loggerheads with her, men fawned over her. I di...more

It certainly had me immersed, if the the 'he said, she said' prose is a little tiring at times. This is a great light hearted read and source for anyone interested in not just the culture, but whole philosophical side of personality and the idea of celebrity. I suppose I fall into the category the book mentions of where women are normally at loggerheads with her, men fawned over her. I didnt exactly fawn over Anna Wintour when I met her but I was certainly charmed by the subtle, flirtatious way she had with the opposite sex that the author mentions. But then, penis or no penis, I was in a position where I wasn't in this person's firing line, I was in a position where she wanted my help (in this case, I worked in a bookshop and she needed my assistance) and when she got my help, she was charming, friendly and engaging and so were her family, all of which I chatted to. Who knows if this is an accurate description of the life of the person I met. It probably mostly is and it is certainly well researched, despite relying heavily on the testimony of others. Most of whom were shitcanned by the subject. Anyway, I really enjoyed it, but that was probably because I was curious about that mysterious and beguiling woman that I briefly met. (less)
The author's goal for this book must have been: take a subject that seems very interesting, that people are fascinated with, that has inspired a famous chick lit novel and movie, that was the central subject of a famous documentary, and then make that subject as boring as possible. So much so that even I, as an insomniac, fell asleep while reading. I would give this book one star, but I generally try not to give one star to anyone.

That was an interesting tidbit, grouped among a lot of boring chunkszzzzzzzzzzzzzz.(less)

Well, What I've learned is that bumper sticker is still true: Well behaved women rarely make history.  This book will not surprise anyone. Anna is both and icy bitch, but also has been in love and shown kindness (to a select few).

I have to say that this book is very inspiring for ppl who have a desire to accomplish something in life and ppl around them are telling them that it seems unlikely. Never giving up and working extremely hard pays off in the end. I'm sure certain things that were described in the book she probably wouldn't have wanted anyone to know but we all have flaws and will or may so things that others may deem unseemly. She's a great role model to me and I'd love to delve into her brain even more.
Excellent book about uberbitch Anna Wintour. She had an icy cold childhood and not enough attention from daddy, thus attached herself to numerous daddy figures who opened many doors for her in the fashion biz. She seems to have had almost an obsessive compulsion for fashion and little/no regard for people's feelings. Still, a fascinating psychological profile.
Anna Wintour is one of the most fascinating people ever. However, this book was not well-written. The author really should have made more effort to make his collection of anecdotes more lively and engaging. I appreciated the linear structure, and I did learn a lot about this ice queen, but this book was pretty dry stylistically. 
As an Anna fan, it was fun to get the dirt on my favorite editrix in this (unofficial?) biography. I loved reading about Anna's younger, party girl days and get a better idea of her roots (fabulous) and where her perceived cold demeanor stems from in life. Recommended read for all publishing and New York media fanatics!
I'm always interested in the biographies of "powerful" women, and I wasn't disappointed with this book. However, I admit that I am somewhat of a skeptic.  I find myself thinking..."How credible is the author?", and "Does she/he have an axe to grind?"...I guess it's the journalist in me who feels compelled to trust but verify!  
God. I love this woman. She's AH-MAZING! I knew the story was familar when he started talking about the book that she took hoome every night. I knew it was linked to Devil Wears Prada! Anna was confident and I respect that sooo much. I want to be as sucessful as her someday except a little les bitchy involed.
Clearly, the author took tremendous glee sharing lots of vicious gossip about Ms. Wintour.  She does make a good villain, but this was pretty over-the-top.  It is what it is...fluffy, not well written, with a smattering of juicy and interesting insider info.  Eh.  Glad to be moving on.
This is an (unauthorized) bio about Anna Wintour - the editor-in-chief of Vogue. It's a good companion for The Devil Wears Prada and a tasty little insight into the life and times of the most powerful woman in fashion. (No I didn't copy that from the back cover)
A little slow at times, but overall fascinating. Even if you aren't interested in the world of fashion, it's interesting to learn how a woman without even a high school degree is one of the most influential women in fashion and the magazine industry. 
such an interesting book about such a powerful woman that we really dont know a lot about.i would recommend this to anyone who loves fashion and/or magazines. or even people who just want to know a bit more about the most powerful woman in the fashion world.
This was alright. It's a biography about Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue. She was portrayed in the movie "The Devil Wears Prada" by Meryl Streep. She did a great job too, because the woman was actually like that, and probably a lot worse.
A lot of this book is gossip and speculation rather than straight facts but it's oh so juicy. Sort of like watching Jersey Shore, shallow yet engaging. Lovely and trashy plus this woman just plain fascinates me.
