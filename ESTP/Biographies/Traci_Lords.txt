Kristie Elizabeth Nussman, Traci Elizabeth Lords, Tracy Lords, Nora Kuzma, Tracie Lords, director known as Cheech Bogardt
Traci Elizabeth Lords (born Nora Louise Kuzma;[1] May 7, 1968) is an American film actress, producer, film director, writer and singer. She first achieved notoriety for her underage appearances in pornographic videos (she was 16 years old in her first movie in 1984) and Penthouse magazine (September 1984),[2][3] later becoming a television and B-movie actress.
Nora Louise Kuzma was born in Steubenville, Ohio to Louis and Patricia Kuzma (née Briceland). Her stage name is said to be a tribute to Katharine Hepburn's character Tracy Lord from The Philadelphia Story or from the first name of her high school best friend Traci and the last name of her favorite actor from Hawaii Five-O, Jack Lord. She was raped at the age of ten.[4] At 12, she fled from her abusive, alcoholic father to Lawndale, California, with her mother and three sisters. Her mother's new boyfriend, Roger, was a cocaine dealer who molested her.[5] In 1983, she began attending Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California.
At age 15, Nora dropped out of high school and was living with her mother's ex-boyfriend, Roger. Posing as her stepfather, he helped her respond to classified ads requesting models. Using a false driver's license ID provided by Roger's girlfriend that stated she was 20 rather than 15,[6] she started in the porn industry with Jim South at the World Modeling Agency in Sherman Oaks, under the name Kristie Elizabeth Nussman.[5]
She quickly ventured into adult movies. Her first movie was What Gets Me Hot!, followed by Those Young Girls and Talk Dirty To Me Part III, all made in the first half of 1984. Shortly afterward, Nora (now calling herself Traci Lords) was modeling for widely distributed adult magazines, most notably Penthouse, in the same September 1984 issue that exposed Miss America 1984, Vanessa Williams. By the time she was 18, she had appeared in 100 adult films; however, Lords argued in her autobiography that about 80 of those films were composed from leftover and re-edited footage from 21 of her original films.[7]
In late May 1986, around three weeks after her 18th birthday, authorities discovered she had been underage while making all but one of her pornographic movies, took her into protective custody, and provided her with a lawyer. The owners of her movie agency and X-Citement Video, Inc. were arrested (See United States v. X-Citement Video.) The ensuing prosecution against the agencies cost the pornographic film and distribution industry millions of dollars, as they were obliged by law to remove hundreds of thousands of her videotapes, films and magazines from store shelves to avoid the risk of prosecution for trafficking in child pornography. (The legality varies with countries. For example, while it is illegal in France to produce a pornographic film involving an actor under 18, the film itself remains legal to own.[8])
In her autobiography, Traci Lords: Underneath It All (2003), Lords suggested hypocrisy on the part of the movie producers and the news media, arguing the porn industry actually got richer from the publicity of the scandal, even as they complained of losing money after destroying her illegal movies. Lords felt she was also exploited by the reporters, who used censored stills from her unlawful films. Lords herself was never charged with a crime. Instead, the agents and producers who accepted her false IDs were charged, and people affiliated with the films in question experienced legal troubles for years.
Lords received a salary for her appearances in X-rated movies. According to her autobiography, she received $35,000 as total salary for all of those movies, including the $5,000 for her appearance in Penthouse.
For her last few porn films, she and her boyfriend formed the Traci Lords Company, where he co-produced and directed the movies. Lords received a smaller salary, but also received part of the rights of these movies.
Only one of her adult porn films, Traci, I Love You, videotaped and produced in Paris, France, took place after her 18th birthday, making it the only one legally available in the United States. (However, in non-US jurisdictions where the age restriction on pornography is lower, as well as over the Internet, her earlier films continue to be distributed.) While most of her pre-18 films were removed permanently from distribution in the United States, several were simply re-edited to remove Lords' scenes entirely (such as "Kinky Business" and "New Wave Hookers"), or in a few cases, had new footage shot with a different actress playing her part (as in "Talk Dirty to Me Part III", where her character was essential to the storyline).[citation needed]
In early 1987, nearly a year after her arrest, Lords sold her rights to Traci, I Love You for $100,000. This action led to claims that Lords herself had tipped off the authorities to gain immunity from prosecution, while profiting from the movie.[7] Lords denies this notion in her autobiography, and claims she was reluctant to sell the rights, since at that time she was trying to become a mainstream actress, and wanted no older movies still available. Also, she wrote that she knew nothing of people's real names or who produced which film, and did not provide such information to the FBI. The FBI agents "appeared annoyed" when she could not provide the information they wanted. She said the agents claimed to have monitored her for three years.[7]
Government prosecutors declared Lords was a victim of a manipulative industry, maintaining she was drugged and made to do non-consensual acts. But industry insiders, like Ron Jeremy, Ginger Lynn and Tom Byron, say they never saw her use drugs, and insist that she was always fully aware of her actions. One of her co-workers from that time, Christy Canyon, has gone so far as to say about Lords' autobiography: "I think her book could have been fabulous, except that she was lying throughout the whole thing."[9]
While Lords decries the pornographic film industry, she continues to use the stage name she gave herself as a minor, and ultimately made it her legal name. She wrote, "I chose to stop running from it. Instead, I won it, legally changing my name to Traci Elizabeth Lords. That's who I was, and that's who I was going to be."[7] Lords stated she is not trying to deny her past, telling Oprah Winfrey: "I found you can run, but you cannot hide."[10]
Lords moved into mainstream films, and has appeared in several movies. At age 18, Lords began studying method acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute,[11] and soon afterward, starred in Not of This Earth, a remake of Roger Corman's 1957 film.[12] Then in 1990, she appeared in John Waters' Cry-Baby, playing the role of Wanda Woodward. Other movies on her resume include Shock 'Em Dead, Blade, Tommyknockers, Black Mask 2: City of Masks and Chump Change. The last won her a Best Actress Award at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. She has also made cameo appearances in Serial Mom, Nowhere, Virtuosity, and Panic Button in 2007 (made for TV).
In addition to movies, Lords has also made many appearances in television series, including Wiseguy in the episode "Date With an Angel", Married... with Children, MacGyver, Highlander: The Series, Tales from the Crypt, Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Gilmore Girls, and Will & Grace among others, along with recurring roles in Profiler, Melrose Place and Roseanne. She made her musical debut on the Manic Street Preachers' U.K. Top 40 hit "Little Baby Nothing", which features on the album, "Generation Terrorists".[13] On this song, Lords sings a duet with leading Manics singer, James Dean Bradfield, but did not appear in the music video. She appeared in the music videos of other performers and groups. In 1995, Lords made her solo debut, in collaboration with Juno Reactor and Jesus Jones' Mike Edwards, called 1000 Fires. The Juno Reactor-produced first single "Control" reached No. 2 on the Billboard Dance Charts.[14] The song "Control" was featured in the 1995 movie adaptation of the game Mortal Kombat, where it was played as an instrumental. She said in 2001 she had auditioned for the 1992 film Army of Darkness. "I didn't get the part but I clicked with [star] Bruce [Campbell]", with whom she would later work as a guest star on Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.[15]
In 2003, she published her autobiography, Traci Lords: Underneath It All (ISBN 0-06-050820-5), which made the New York Times bestseller list.[16] In December of that year, Lords wrote and directed a short film with Fox Searchlab entitled "Sweet Pea", shown at film festivals in 2005.[citation needed] The film is loosely inspired by an experience recounted in her autobiography, and involves a teenage girl who finds herself overcome with doubt after being raped by her boyfriend. In 2004, Lords recorded the independently produced double A-side "Sunshine."[citation needed]
Lords appeared in Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008) and I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell. Lords' character in the former is loosely based on herself, but she refused to appear nude.[citation needed] She also starred in the 2009 low-budget science fiction film Princess of Mars.
In October 2007 at age 39, Lords gave birth to a son, Joseph Gunnar, her first child with her husband of five years, Jeff Lee.[17]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Traci Lords is a study of a determined and complex woman with a very controversial background. Born and raised in Ohio as Nora Louise Kuzma, she moved with her divorced mother and three sisters to Los Angeles at age 12. While staying at the house of her mother's boyfriend, Roger, she began nude modeling at age 15, then adult films a year later.An incredibly developed, full-figured girl, she easily duped photographers, producers and directors (with the help of a false birth certificate and driver's license). Her stage name is a combination of Traci, from a former school friend, and Lords, in honor of her favorite male actor, Jack Lord (Hawaii Five-O (1968)). She later owned a white Persian cat named Mr. Steve McGarrett, the name of the character Lord played on the show. Traci made somewhere between 80 and 100 X-rated movies (some consisted mostly of leftover footage from previous shoots) between 1984 and 1986.In May 1986 she was arrested by FBI agents when it was discovered she was underage, which meant that any films with her in them were illegal to rent or buy, and video stores around the country rushed to remove them. The only legal porn movie Traci made was Traci, I Love You (1987), which was filmed in Paris, France, on her 18th birthday. Since she controlled distribution rights, many people believed she orchestrated the revelation herself so she could be the only one to profit from her X-rated career. Many within the adult film industry made a tacit agreement to never promote Traci or talk about her, as they felt she betrayed the industry that had had been the source of her fame in the first place. The federal government tried to prosecute the producers of the movie Those Young Girls (1984), the first adult film Traci appeared in, for child pornography. However, the case fell apart when the government admitted that it, too, had been duped when Lords traveled to Europe to shoot Traci, I Love You (1987) on a fake passport. After her exile from adult films, she began to resurrect her life and fulfill her lifelong ambition to star in "mainstream" films.In 1987 she enrolled in the Lee Strasberg acting school, began voice lessons and built on her natural acting talents. Her first mainstream "break" came in Not of This Earth (1988), a remake of the classic Roger Corman sci-fi film from the 1950s. It was the last time that Traci would bare her breasts for the camera.Throughout the 1990s her hard work got her a reputation as a reliable and respected actress, in addition to being a singer and an advocate for gay rights. Her recurring role in early 1995 as a sneering sociopath, Rikki, on Melrose Place (1992) was critically acclaimed and landed her more roles in other movies, playing villains and psychotic characters. In the latter half of the 1990s she appeared in several B movies that went straight to video and/or cable in lead, minor or cameo roles. She even guest-starred in a number of TV shows ranging from Married with Children (1987), Roseanne (1988), MacGyver (1985) and Nash Bridges (1996).She has always despised being referred to as "an ex-porn star", and resents the fact that a celebrity like Tim Allen can be forgiven by Hollywood for past transgressions (he was convicted and served prison time selling drugs while he was in college) but she still to this day bears the stigma of her porn years. It's probably the fantasy of the underage girl who fooled an entire industry, and, at the height of her career, was unquestionably the most popular actress with fans and filmmakers alike.Some of her most notable TV work was as a regular on season 2 of Profiler (1996) from 1997 to 1998 in playing the schizo-sicko serial killer Sharon Lesher, as well as the tough heroine Jordan Radcliffe during the last season of the sci-fi series First Wave (1998) from 2000 to 2001. She most recently has written her autobiography, published in 2003, and even tried her hand in writing and directing a short film which would lead her to another career as a writer-director of independent films.
      Was the centerfold model for the same issue of Penthouse Magazine that "exposed" Miss America 1984, Vanessa Williams. Because she was underage, it was illegal to own or trade that issue unless the pictorial of Ms. Lords was removed.
      Her father, Louis Kuzma, is an immigrant from Ukraine. Her mother, Patricia Briceland, is of Scandanavian descent.
      She is easily the most successful of former porn stars to make a transition to mainstream movies.
      She contributed vocals to the Manic Street Preachers song "Little Baby Nothing," from the Welsh group's "Generation Terrorists" album in 1992, and released as a single in November of that year. The song is about the sexual exploitation of a woman and singer/guitarist James Dean Bradfield said that "we needed somebody, a symbol, a person that could actually symbolize the lyrics and justify them to a certain degree. Traci was more than happy to do it. She saw the lyrics, and she had an immediate affinity with them. It was definitely easy to incorporate her personality into the lyrics. We just wanted a symbol for it, and I think she was a great symbol." Traci said that "I listened to the tape and really identified with the character in the song...this young girl who's been exploited and abused by men all her life."
      A bra worn by Traci (from her relationship with ex-fiancé John Enos III) sold at auction on eBay for $80.00 in April, 2007.
      Mother, with Jeff Gruenewald, of son Joseph Gunnar Lee, born October 7, 2007. He weighed 6 pounds, 14 ounces.
      Was almost cast as the female lead in Martin Scorsese's Casino (1995), but lost out to Sharon Stone.
      Appeared as one of the celebrity models in a charity fashion show staged by Thierry Mugler to benefit AIDS Project Los Angeles. [April 1992]
      [asked about her role as Jordan Radcliffe on First Wave (1998)] I jokingly refer to it as the DKNY Militia because she always looks great. When she's battling the aliens, she's always got the best leather pants on.
      I hate the phrase "former porn queen." That part of my life was a long time ago. Think of something else to call me... I'm successful in spite of my past, not because of it.

                Traci Lord, one of the first true porn queens, had made 100 films by her eighteenth birthday.With an abusive home life and an abortion as childhood memories, Lords ran away from home to live with a forty-something boyfriend when she was 15. Borrowing the birth certificate of a friend’s sister, she faked her way into the porn industry. Racking up dozens of film appearances, she also modeled for adult magazines, including Penthouse. Before she reached 18, the federal authorities discovered she was underage, and arrested the owners of her movie agency and X-citement Video. Shops were forced to pull all her tapes and magazines from their shelves and dump them. As a minor, Lords could not herself be charged. The government was more interested in clobbering the porn industry and the Lords case gave the perfect excuse. It was the producers who had accepted her fake ID, and people involved in making her films, that took the rap. Lords herself claimed she was a victim of the industry, that she was drugged and made to do things against her wishes. Her boyfriends and co-workers disagree; they never saw her use drugs and believe she was fully conscious of her actions. Although Lords said she was trying to escape her porn past, she never changed the stage name that was so associated to her ‘damaging’ publicity. She has since made a number of second rate films, appeared in several US TV series and collaborated with the Manic Street Preachers on the single, 'Little Baby Nothing'.

"If you're sexy, everybody will love you. That's what I wanted -- for everybody to love me." -Traci Lords, on her tainted past.
                Traci Lords is best known as the most famous and successful underage adult film star, having done 100 movies as a teenager. She has since tried to go mainstream, while appearing in low-budget movies and the occasional high-budget ones like Blade (1998).            
                Traci Lords' past certainly raises the eyebrows of quite a few men. In fact, she remains one of the most searched celebrities on the Internet (including on AskMen.com). Though she plays down her sexiness, she won't have a hard time finding men who'll swear by her sex appeal.            
                According to porn industry insiders, Traci Lords made over $1 million from her X-rated movies, and even had video companies give her $10,000 a month,  furnish her with an apartment and a Mercedes. Traci's take is that she made only $20,000 during her time in the industry.  At least she managed to get some work in mainstream roles, including calendars, posters, acting jobs in such C-list films as Extramarital, Me and Will, You're Killing Me and Epicenter. Though those films were trash, she still managed a small but memorable role in the Stephen King TV series The Tommyknockers. She was also a contestant on the TV reality show Celebrity Paranormal Project in 2006.            
                Traci Elizabeth Lords was born May 7, 1968, in Steubenville, Ohio, originally named Nora Louise Kuzma. The Traci Lords we know today, controversy and all, is a combination of Nora's high school best friend, Traci; the character Katharine Hepburn played in The Philadelphia Story; and the last name Lords, after her favorite actor from her favorite show, Hawaii Five-O's Jack Lords.  traci lords the porn star Traci Lords moved to Lawndale, California, with her mother and three sisters, fleeing her alcoholic father. While a student at Redondo Union High School, she ran away from home at the age of 15 after having had an abortion. While living with a man in his 40's, Traci went to Jim South's World Modeling Agency (for adult movies) with a friend's sister's birth certificate, which read Kristie Elizabeth Nussman, age 22.  Her "roommate" accompanied her to Jim South's Agency (he claimed to be her stepfather), and convinced Mr. South that Traci would soon be a porno movie star, and after Traci stripped and showed that she was certainly not shy, she was in.  Her first film was What Gets Me Hot! in 1984. By the time she was 18, she had starred in more than 100 porno movies, such as Open Up Traci, Two Timing Traci, Sex Fifth Avenue, and Holly Does Hollywood -- each gradually more graphic.  oh lordy, traci's busted Traci Lords was a porno queen; she was recognized worldwide and got mobbed wherever she went. But when authorities found out that she was underage while in these movies, prosecutors arrested Traci as well as the owners of her porn movie agency, X-citement Video Inc., and the hundreds of films she appeared in were deemed illegal and taken off the shelves.  In 1984, Traci posed for a Penthouse centerfold, in the same issue that ultimately exposed Vanessa Williams, but the issue is also considered illegal.  The only "Traci" movie that is considered legal is Traci I Love You, which she sold to a distributor. She may have been just a porno actress, but Traci was also a businesswoman who wrote her scripts, and developed Traci Lords Productions along with her boyfriend at the time. The company produced movies such as Traci Takes Tokyo and Beverly Hills Copulator.  traci lords in the tommyknockers Traci Lords left the porn scene for a while and returned in the late '80s to do television appearances and B-movies. She appeared in Wiseguy, Married... With Children and MacGyver, and movies like 1988's Not Of This Earth (her first mainstream movie), 1989's Fast Food, 1990's Cry-Baby, 1991's A Time To Die, Raw Nerve and Laser Moon, and the 1993 made-for-TV movie The Tommyknockers, based on the Stephen King novel of the same name.  Among her many roles, the higher profile ones include those in the films Serial Mom (1994), Virtuosity (1995) and Blade (1998); a recurring role on Melrose Place in 1995; appearances on Roseanne, Nash Bridges; and a part as herself in D.R.E.A.M. Team (with Traci Bingham and Angie Everhart).  She apparently lost a role in Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula, to Sadie Frost Jude Law's ex-wife.  Traci is also a singer, who has contributed her vocals to the Manic Street Preachers' Little Baby Nothing, the Ramones' Somebody to Love, and performed songs for the movies Virtuosity and Mortal Kombat.  traci lords in celebrity paranormal project In 2000 Traci Lords appeared in two flicks -- Epicenter and Certain Guys. She also appeared on TV's First Wave. In the next few years Traci could be seen in the movies Chump Change (2001), Home (2003), Frostbite (2005), and Crazy Eights (2006), as well as the TV shows Gilmore Girls and Celebrity Paranormal Project.

At 14, Nora Kuzma ran away from home and ended up on the dirty streets of Hollywood. She fell in with a fast crowd, and her dreams of modelling soon landed her a spectacular centrefold in Penthouse Magazine, where at 15 she became internationally known as TRACI LORDS. From there she appeared in numerous adult films and magazines, denying her past and battling a deep addiction to cocaine and men. Three years later she got out. This is her memoir–a tale of loss, redemption, and ultimate survival as Traci Elizabeth Lords takes you into her secretive past, faces her demons, and shares her extraordinary journey of personal growth.

       Nora Kuzma was a troubled teenager from Steubenville, Ohio; Traci Lords was the underage skin mag/porn queen who became the centerpiece of the adult video industry's greatest scandal. In reality, they were one and the same, the subject of this slick, if thin autobiography. But what's striking here is not the familiar storyline--confused, sexually abused teen falls in with drugs and the wrong Southern California crowd, forges fake IDs to become Penthouse Pet of the Month at 16 and the '80s hottest adult star, then arrested as focus of the Reagan administration's crackdown on porn, only to become reborn as cleaned-up, psychoanalyzed/rehabed purveyor of legitimate film, TV, and music career. Rather, what's striking is Lords's capacity for denial, compartmentalization, and myopia when it serves her ends.   Her scandalous tenure in the skin trade--undeniably the sole basis for her infamy and subsequent legitimate career--is glossed over here in a few score pages, with more attention paid to the heavy-metal musicians that dotted her life than the motivations and machinations of the Feds who literally changed her life; Slash's snake gets more ink here than Attorney General Ed Meese. Quick to ladle generous sympathy on her own plight, she heaps little but scorn upon those from the seedy past of her porn-star alter-ego, yet seems to have had few qualms about formally adopting that moniker as her legal name. --Jerry McCulley
       Mention the author of this notable memoir to a group of men and many will grin; mention her to a group of women and many will look blank. Both responses should change during the media frenzy over this book, because readers of both sexes will learn that the story of Lords, the most notorious graduate of the porn industry, is one deserving of compassion, admiration and attention. Lords is notorious because when she ruled porn, in the mid-1980s, she was under the age of 18. Born Nora Kuzma in 1968 in Ohio, she writes, she was raised in poverty and abused emotionally by an alcoholic father and raped at age 10 by a 16-year-old. By her early teens, Lords was hanging out with the wild crowd at school and was preyed upon by her mother's boyfriend, who arranged for her first modeling sessions, which led to her posing as a Penthouse centerfold at age 15 (she had false ID) and then to her meteoric career in porn, which crashed when the FBI stepped in and turned her into a poster child for sex abuse. Lords's career didn't end in 1986; she's gone on to star and costar in several films and TV shows, including John Waters's Cry Baby and Married with Children, and has enjoyed serious success as a singer. She has an amazing story to tell, and she tells it well here, without a coauthor, in prose that's bumpy at times, smooth at others, but always seemingly honest and courageous. Frank, opinionated, intelligent, drenched in emotion, this is the rare celebrity memoir that doubles as a cautionary tale, and will have readers cheering Lords on as they speed through its gritty, big-souled pages.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.

  Traci Lords became famous or infamous, it depends how you see her situation, after she and the adult film industry were caught with their pants down. Which's isn't a bad thing in porn unless your under 18 which Traci was for most of her triple X career. So 20 years later it's not surprising that Ms. Lords revisits that dark time in her life.The first half of the book is compelling. In it she details her young life in Ohio working class towns. It's probably no surprise that she had father issues. Her Dad was abusive and her Mom, making a series of bad decisions, dropped that deadbeat for an even sleazier deadbeat.  Traci was also developing at an early age found that her sex not only brought unwanted attention, but often unwanted advances. A move to California and the drug culture combined to make the perfect storm for young Traci. By 15 she was posing as a model and by 17 she was an established porn star. After a late night FBI raid Traci and the adult industry was busted. Traci would leave the triple X fare behind and strike out as a "legitimate" actress with moderate success.This is where the rest of the book, which chronicles her mainstream career, falters. It reads more like a resume then an autobiography. No real insights are offered after her porn career and to be honest few insights are shared before and during her porn career. Because Lords avoids many details and offers little insight into her self, we're left with a pretty non-descript depiction of her life. The first half of the books works better because the story is so compelling, but Traci makes few attempts to look inside herself and the result is stunting.The book is also very non-sexual. This is neither good nor bad, but those looking for an erotic read will be disappointed.

"Imagination is more important than intelligence," as Albert Einstein used to say and Traci Lords has now proved in her new autobiography "Underneath It All."Not that Ms. Lords is dumb. Far from it. Throughout her book she displays a keen mind to match her accomplishments as the only former adult movie actress ever to achieve mainstream success. Although this does not mean much in global terms of important world news, her life story is interesting enough in its own right, and in its own way even has a moral of redemption.Born Nora Kuzma in Steubenville, Ohio, in 1968, Ms. Lords' childhood was marred by a traumatic rape that occurred when she was only 10 years old. After her mother moved the family to California, the young Miss Kuzma found herself a stranger in a strange land just when she most needed guidance. Instead, left largely neglected, with little parental supervision for long periods of time, she became a heavy drug abuser in high school. Then her mother's ex-boyfriend introduced her to nude modeling and got her started performing in XXX-rated movies when she was just 15.This is the most delicate and difficult part of "Underneath It All." On the one hand, Ms. Lords must answer legitimate questions about her role in what was the biggest porn scandal of the 1980s. On the other hand, there is a fine line between addressing those questions and describing details of her erotic exploits that appeal more to the reader's prurient interests than to advance her main story.Generally speaking, Ms. Lords does an admirable job in covering this ground with grace and honesty. For legal reasons, she does not provide the real name of the producer who hired her as an underage actress (but the pseudonym she uses identifies him for anyone remotely familiar with the case).Read more ›
  I so much wanted to like this book better than I did.  Clearly, Ms. Lords has led a tragic life of neglect and abuse and, more importantly, has managed to triumph over it.  She seems to have reached a place in her life and career where happiness is coming to her.  And she deserves it.  And I wanted to cheer for her.The problem is, her writing is just not very good.  At times overwrought and flowery and at others vague to the point where I wasn't sure what was happening, her prose just wasn't equal to her own story.  Her writing didn't allow me to feel the things I wanted to feel--I couldn't share her rage at the people who had done her wrong or her joys at her successes.  At times, I couldn't even feel sympathy for her or interest in what was happening.Normally, I believe strongly in people telling their own story.  In this case, however, Ms. Lords might have been better served by a ghostwriter.  She at least deserved a better editor who could have helped her control some of her poorer tendencies as a writer.  The book does improve as it goes on but I'm afraid most people won't make it that far.  That's too bad because there is a life here worth reading about.
  If you are looking for a sexually graphic depiction of Traci's life or sexually graphic details of the porn industry this book is not for you. While Traci inadvertantly propelled the porn industry into mainstream bringing the industry a financial windfall, she did not prosper. A product of rape and child molestation Traci Lords finds herself in an adult world of porn, sex, drugs, and manipulation. While this heartbreaking book goes into great detail about this aspect of her life, it is only the beginning. She is able to excape the porn industry and drugs and eventually marries and becomes a successful TV actress, movie actress, singer, model and now author. While the porn industry has no love for her and many porn fans only have lust for her, I think anyone who reads this book will get to know a very intimate side of this person and see a great strength in someone who has been able to over come a great adversity when the odds were against her. As I read this book, I found myself drawn into her world and was left wanting to reach in and pull this poor girl from an awful fate. Fortunately she was able to do this for herself but only after just about everyone she came into contact with her, used her and tossed her aside. Today she is a child advocate and works to save those like herself. This is a great book and would recommend this to anyone.
      Yes this was definitely written by Traci Lords (Nora Kuzma) who isn't a great writer by any means.  What she has to say offers value and entertainment/emotional value.
      Loved this book!! How inspiring and scary. She really is a survivor!!! I still can't believe all the adults in her life so ready to turn a blind eye take advantage and not one...
      I'm giving this 4 stars because (1) I couldn't put the book down once I started (so I enjoyed it), but (2) she leaves out so much of her life (I felt like I was reading an outline...
      Yes this story is very emotional; it talks about her dark life when she was child born in a broken small city called "Steubenville, Ohio.
      If you are one of those that want to read this book to see the inside of the porn industry, especially told by a porn actress then you would be disappointed like me.
      What an interesting story.  Traci Lords offers an inside look to her life before and after porn.  I highly recommend.
      the subject is fascinating and you really become sympathetic to her when reading it.  Its amazing how some kids are so abused.  Its nice to see that she did end up pretty good too.
      Good read.........Traci overcame a lot of obstacles to become a legitimate actress which was her original intent.
      this story by Tracy Lords was interesting in that everyone thinks she was some great mastermind and really she was just sort of a victim of circumstance.
      I've read many biographies, the ones I prefer are the ones that expose the darkest, rawest details and you won't find much of that here.
