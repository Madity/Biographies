James Randi (born Randall James Hamilton Zwinge, August 7, 1928) is a Canadian-American retired stage magician and scientific skeptic[2][3] best known for his challenges to paranormal claims and pseudoscience.[4] Randi is the founder of the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF). Randi began his career as a magician named The Amazing Randi, but after retiring at age 60, he was able to devote most of his time to investigating paranormal, occult, and supernatural claims, which he collectively calls "woo-woo."[5]
Although often referred to as a "debunker," Randi dislikes the term's connotations and prefers to describe himself as an "investigator."[6] He has written about the paranormal, skepticism, and the history of magic. He was a frequent guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and was occasionally featured on the television program Penn & Teller: Bullshit! The JREF sponsors the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge offering a prize of US$1,000,000 to eligible applicants[7] who can demonstrate evidence of any paranormal, supernatural or occult power or event under test conditions agreed to by both parties.[8]
Randi was born in Toronto, Canada, on August 7, 1928,[9] the son of Marie Alice (née Paradis) and George Randall Zwinge.[9] He has a younger brother and sister.[10] He took up magic after seeing Harry Blackstone, Sr.[11] and reading magic books while spending 13 months in a body cast following a bicycle accident. He confounded doctors who expected he would never walk again.[12] Randi often skipped classes, and, at 17, dropped out of high school to perform as a conjurer in a carnival roadshow.[13] He practiced as a mentalist in local nightclubs and at Toronto's Canadian National Exhibition, and wrote for Montreal's tabloid press.[14] In his twenties, Randi posed as a psychic to establish that they were actually doing simple tricks, and briefly wrote an astrological column in the Canadian tabloid Midnight under the name "Zo-ran," by simply shuffling up items from newspaper astrology columns and pasting them randomly into a column.[15][16] In his thirties, Randi worked in Philippine nightclubs and all across Japan.[17] He witnessed many tricks that were presented as being supernatural. One of his earliest reported experiences is that of seeing an evangelist using a version of the "one-ahead"[18] technique to convince churchgoers of his divine powers.[19]
Though defining himself as a conjuror, Randi's career as a professional stage magician[20] and escapologist began in 1946. Initially, he presented himself under his real name, Randall Zwinge, which he later dropped in favor of "The Amazing Randi." Early in his career, he performed numerous escape acts from jail cells and safes around the world. On February 7, 1956, he appeared live on NBC's Today show, where he remained for 104 minutes in a sealed metal coffin that had been submerged in a hotel swimming pool, breaking what was said to be Harry Houdini's record of 93 minutes.[21][22]
In the late 1960s, Randi hosted The Amazing Randi Show on New York radio station WOR.[23] This radio show, which filled Long John Nebel's old slot with similar content after Nebel went to WNBC in 1962, often invited guests who defended paranormal claims, among them Randi's then-friend James W. Moseley. Randi, in turn, spoke at Moseley's 1967 Fourth Congress of Scientific Ufologists in New York City,[24] stating, "Let's not fool ourselves. There are some garden variety liars involved in all this. But in among all the trash and nonsense perpetrated in the name of Ufology, I think there is a small grain of truth."[25]
Randi also hosted numerous television specials and went on several world tours. As "The Amazing Randi" he appeared regularly on the New York-based children's television series Wonderama from 1959 to 1967.[26] He also hosted a revival of the 1950s children's show The Magic Clown in 1970, though the program enjoyed only a brief life.[27] In the February 2, 1974, issue of the British conjuring magazine Abracadabra, Randi, defining the community of magicians, stated, "I know of no calling which depends so much upon mutual trust and faith as does ours." In the December 2003 issue of The Linking Ring, the monthly publication of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, it is stated, "Perhaps Randi's ethics are what make him Amazing" and "The Amazing Randi not only talks the talk, he walks the walk."[28]
During Alice Cooper's 1973–1974 tour, Randi performed on stage as a dentist and Alice's executioner.[29] He also designed and built several of the stage props, including the guillotine.[30] Shortly after that, in a 1976 performance for the Canadian TV special World of Wizards, Randi escaped from a straitjacket while suspended upside-down over Niagara Falls.[31]
Randi has been accused of actually using "psychic powers" to perform acts such as spoon bending. According to James Alcock, at a meeting where Randi was duplicating the performances of Uri Geller, a professor from the University at Buffalo shouted out that Randi was a fraud. Randi said, "Yes, indeed, I'm a trickster, I'm a cheat, I'm a charlatan, that's what I do for a living. Everything I've done here was by trickery." The professor shouted back: "That's not what I mean. You're a fraud because you're pretending to do these things through trickery, but you're actually using psychic powers and misleading us by not admitting it."[32] A similar event involved Senator Claiborne Pell, a believer in psychic phenomena. When Randi personally demonstrated to Pell that he could reveal a concealed drawing that had been secretly made by the senator simply by using trickery, Pell refused to believe that it was a trick, saying, "I think Randi may be a psychic and doesn't realize it." Randi has consistently denied having any paranormal powers or abilities.[33]
Randi is author of 10 books, among them Conjuring (1992), a biographical history of noted magicians. The book is subtitled: Being a Definitive History of the Venerable Arts of Sorcery, Prestidigitation, Wizardry, Deception, & Chicanery and of the Mountebanks & Scoundrels Who have Perpetrated these Subterfuges on a Bewildered Public, in short, MAGIC! The book's cover says that it is by "James Randi, Esq., A Contrite Rascal Once Dedicated to these Wicked Practices but Now Almost Totally Reformed." The book selects the most influential magicians and tells some of their history in the context of strange deaths and careers on the road. This work expanded on Randi's second book which was called Houdini, His Life and Art.[34] This illustrated work was published in 1976 and was co-authored with Bert Sugar. It focuses on the professional and private life of Houdini.[35]
Randi also wrote a children's book in 1989 titled The Magic World of the Amazing Randi, which introduced children to magic tricks. In addition to his magic books, he has written several educational works about the paranormal and pseudoscientific. These include biographies of Uri Geller and Nostradamus as well as reference material on other major paranormal figures. He is currently working on A Magician in the Laboratory, which recounts his application of skepticism to science.[36][37] He is a member of the all-male literary banqueting club the Trap Door Spiders, which served as the basis of Isaac Asimov's fictional group of mystery solvers, the Black Widowers.[38]
Randi entered the international spotlight in 1972 when he publicly challenged the claims of Uri Geller. Randi accused Geller of being nothing more than a charlatan and a fraud who used standard magic tricks to accomplish his allegedly paranormal feats, and he presented his claims in the book The Truth About Uri Geller (1982).[19][39] Geller sued Randi for $15 million in 1991 and lost.[40] Geller's suit against the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) was thrown out in 1995, and he was ordered to pay $120,000 for filing a frivolous lawsuit.[41] Randi also dismissed Uri Geller's claims that he was capable of the kind of psychic photography made famous by the case of Ted Serios. It is a matter, Randi argues, of trick photography using a hand-held optical device.[42] Randi was a founding fellow and prominent member of CSICOP.[43] During the period of Geller's legal dispute, CSICOP's leadership, wanting to avoid becoming a target of Geller's litigation, requested that Randi refrain from commenting on Geller. Randi refused and resigned, though he maintained a respectful relationship with the group, which in 2006 changed its name to the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. In 2010, Randi was one of 16 new CSI fellows elected by its board.[44]
Randi has gone on to write several books criticizing beliefs and claims regarding the paranormal.[45] He has also demonstrated flaws in studies suggesting the existence of paranormal phenomena; in his Project Alpha hoax, Randi revealed that he had been able to orchestrate a three-year-long compromise of a privately funded psychic research experiment.[46] The hoax became a scandal and demonstrated the shortcomings of many paranormal research projects at the university level.
Randi has appeared on numerous TV shows, sometimes to directly debunk the claimed abilities of fellow guests. In a 1981 appearance on That's My Line, Randi appeared opposite psychic James Hydrick, who said that he could move objects with his mind and appeared to demonstrate this claim on live television by turning a page in a telephone book without touching it.[47] Randi, having determined that Hydrick was surreptitiously blowing on the book, arranged foam packaging peanuts on the table in front of the telephone book for the demonstration. This prevented Hydrick from demonstrating his abilities, which would have been exposed when the blowing moved the packaging.[48] Randi writes that, eventually, Hydrick "confessed everything."[47]
Randi was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1986. The fellowship's 5-year grant helped support Randi's investigations of faith healers, including W. V. Grant, Ernest Angley, and Peter Popoff, whom Randi first exposed on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in February 1986. Hearing about his investigation of Popoff, Carson invited Randi onto his late-night TV show without seeing the evidence he was going to reveal. Carson appeared stunned after Randi showed a brief video segment from one of Popoff's broadcasts showing him calling out a woman in the audience, revealing personal information about her that he claims comes from God, and then performing a laying-on-of-hands healing to drive the devil from her body. Randi then replayed the video, but with some of the sound dubbed in that he and his investigating team captured during the event using a radio scanner and recorder. Their scanner detected the radio frequency Popoff's wife Elizabeth was using backstage to broadcast directions and information to a miniature radio receiver hidden in Popoff's left ear. The information had been gathered by Popoff's assistants, who handed out "prayer cards" to the audience before the show, instructing them to write down all the information Popoff would need to pray for them.[49][50][51]
The news coverage generated by Randi's exposé on The Tonight Show led to many TV stations dropping Popoff's TV show, eventually forcing him into bankruptcy in September 1987.[52] However, the televangelist returned to the airwaves a decade later with faith healing infomercials that reportedly pulled in more than $23 million in 2005, from viewers sending in money for promised healing and prosperity. The Canadian Centre for Inquiry's Think Again! TV documented one of Popoff's more recent performances before a large audience who gathered in Toronto on May 26, 2011, hoping to be saved from illness and poverty.[53]
In 1988, Randi tested the gullibility of the media by perpetrating a hoax of his own. By teaming up with Australia's 60 Minutes program and by releasing a fake press package, he built up publicity for a spirit channeler named Carlos who was actually artist Jose Alvarez, whom Randi described as a "friend."[54] Randi would tell him what to say through sophisticated radio equipment. According to the 60 Minutes program on the Carlos hoax, "it was claimed that Alvarez would not have had the audience he did at the Opera House (and the potential sales there from) had the media coverage been more aggressive (and factual)," though an analysis by The Skeptic's Tim Mendham concluded that while the media coverage of Alvarez's appearances was not credulous, "it [the hoax] at least showed that they could benefit by being a touch more sceptical."[55] The hoax was exposed on 60 Minutes; Carlos and Randi explained how they pulled it off.[56][57]
In the book The Faith Healers, Randi wrote that his anger and relentlessness arises out of compassion for the victims of fraud. Randi has also been critical of João de Deus (John of God), a self-proclaimed psychic surgeon who has received international attention.[58] Randi observed, referring to psychic surgery, "To any experienced conjurer, the methods by which these seeming miracles are produced are very obvious."[59]
In 1982, Randi verified the abilities of Arthur Lintgen, a Philadelphia physician who is able to determine the classical music recorded on a vinyl LP solely by examining the groove on the record. However, Lintgen does not claim to have any paranormal ability, merely knowledge of the way that the groove forms patterns on particular recordings.[60]
In 1988 John Maddox asked Randi to join the supervision of the homeopathy experiment conducted by Jacques Benveniste's team. Once a stricter protocol concerning the experiment was in place, the results could not be reproduced anymore.
James Randi stated that Daniel Dunglas Home, who could allegedly play an accordion that was locked in a cage without touching it, was caught cheating on a few occasions, but the incidents were never made public. He also stated that the accordion in question was a one-octave mouth organ concealed under Home's large moustache and that one-octave mouth organs were found in Home's belongings after his death.[61] According to Randi, William Lindsay Gresham told Randi "around 1960" that he had seen these mouth organs in the Home collection at the Society for Psychical Research (SPR).[62] Eric Dingwall, who catalogued Home's collection on its arrival at the SPR does not record the presence of the mouth organs. According to Peter Lamont, the author of an extensive Home biography, "It is unlikely Dingwall would have missed these or did not make them public."[62]
Randi distinguishes between pseudoscience and crackpot science. He regards most of parapsychology as pseudoscience because of the way in which it is approached, but nonetheless sees it as a legitimate science which "must be pursued," and from which real scientific discoveries may develop.[63] Randi regards crackpot science as being as "equally wrong" as pseudoscience, but with no scientific pretensions.[64]
Exploring Psychic Powers... Live was a television show aired live on June 7, 1989, wherein Randi examined several people claiming psychic powers. The show offered $100,000 (Randi's then $10,000 prize plus $90,000 put up by the show's syndicator, LBS Communications, Inc.[65]) to anyone who could demonstrate genuine psychic powers.
An astrologer claimed that he was able to ascertain a person's astrological sign after talking with them for a few minutes. He was presented with twelve people, one at a time, each with a different astrological sign. The people could not tell the astrologer their astrological sign or birth date, nor could they wear anything that would indicate it. After the astrologer talked to the people, he had them sit in front of a sign that the astrologer thought was theirs. By agreement, the astrologer needed to get ten of them correct to win. He got none correct.
The next psychic claimed to be able to read auras around people. The psychic claimed that auras were visible at least five inches from the people. The psychic chose ten people who had a clearly visible aura. The people were to stand behind screens and the psychic agreed that the aura would be visible above the screens. The screens were numbered 1 through 10, and people were selected whether or not to stand behind their screen at random. The psychic was to tell whether or not a person was standing behind each screen, by seeing the aura above. Since random guessing would be expected to get about five correct, the psychic needed to get eight of the ten right. The psychic stated that she saw an aura over all ten screens, but people were behind only four of the screens.
A dowser claimed that he could locate water, even in a bottle inside a sealed cardboard box. He was shown twenty boxes and the dowser was to indicate which boxes contained a water bottle. He indicated that eight of the boxes contained water, but only five did.[clarification needed]
A psychometric psychic claimed to be able to receive personal information about the owner of an object from the object. In order to avoid ambiguous statements, the psychic agreed to be presented with a watch and a key from twelve different people. The psychic was to match keys and watches belonging to the same person. According to the prior agreement, the psychic had to match nine out of the twelve sets, but she succeeded in only two of the cases.
During the program, another psychic was doing a run of 250 Zener cards, guessing which of the five symbols was on each one. Random guessing should result in about fifty correct predictions, so it was agreed in advance that the psychic had to be right on at least eighty-two cards in order to demonstrate an ability greater than chance. However, she was able to get only fifty predictions correct, which is no better than random guessing.[66]
In 1996, Randi established the James Randi Educational Foundation. Randi and his colleagues update JREF's blog, Swift. Topics have included the mathematics of the one-seventh area triangle. Randi also contributes a regular column, titled "'Twas Brillig," to The Skeptics Society's Skeptic magazine. In his weekly commentary, Randi often gives examples of what he considers the nonsense that he deals with every day.[67]
He has regularly featured on many podcasts, including The Skeptics Society's official podcast Skepticality[68][69] and the Center for Inquiry's official podcast Point of Inquiry.[70] From September 2006 onwards, he has occasionally contributed to The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast with a column titled "Randi Speaks."[71] In addition, The Amazing Show is a podcast in which Randi shares various anecdotes in an interview format.[72]
Randi's parents were members of the Anglican Church, but rarely attended services. He went to Sunday School a few times as a child, but decided to stop going when he was told not to question or doubt the teachings of the church.[73]
In his essay "Why I Deny Religion, How Silly and Fantastic It Is, and Why I'm a Dedicated and Vociferous Bright," Randi, who identifies himself as an atheist,[1] has stated that many accounts in religious texts, including the virgin birth, the miracles of Jesus Christ, and the parting of the Red Sea by Moses, are not believable. For example, Randi refers to the Virgin Mary as being "impregnated by a ghost of some sort, and as a result produced a son who could walk on water, raise the dead, turn water into wine, and multiply loaves of bread and fishes" and questions how Adam and Eve "could have two sons, one of whom killed the other, and yet managed to populate the earth without committing incest." He writes that, compared to the Bible, "The Wizard of Oz is more believable. And more fun."[74]
In An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural (1995), he looks at a variety of spiritual practices skeptically. Of the meditation techniques of Guru Maharaj Ji he writes: "Only the very naive were convinced that they had been let in on some sort of celestial secret."[75] In 2003, he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.[76]
The James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) offers a prize of US$1,000,000 to eligible applicants who are able to demonstrate a supernatural ability under scientific testing criteria agreed by both sides. Based on the paranormal challenges of John Nevil Maskelyne and Houdini, the foundation began in 1964, when Randi put up $1,000 of his own money payable to anyone who could provide objective proof of the paranormal.[77] The prize money has since grown to $1,000,000, and has formal published rules. For example, no one has progressed past the preliminary test, which is set up with parameters agreed to by both Randi and the applicant. He also refuses to accept any challengers who might suffer serious injury or death as a result of the testing.[78] As of April 1, 2007, only those with an established, nationally-recognized media profile and the backing of a reputable academic were allowed to apply for the challenge,[77] in order to avoid wasting resources on spurious claimants.[77]
On Larry King Live, March 6, 2001, Larry King asked Sylvia Browne if she would take the challenge and she apparently agreed.[79] Randi appeared with Browne on Larry King Live six months later, and she again appeared to accept his challenge.[80] However, according to Randi, she ultimately refused to be tested, and the Randi Foundation kept a clock on its website recording the number of weeks since Browne allegedly accepted the challenge without following through, until Browne's death in November 2013.[81]
During an appearance on Larry King Live on June 5, 2001, Randi challenged Rosemary Altea to undergo testing for the million dollars, but Altea refused to address the question.[82] Instead Altea replied only, "I agree with what he says, that there are many, many people who claim to be spiritual mediums, they claim to talk to the dead. There are many people, we all know this. There are cheats and charlatans everywhere."[82] On January 26, 2007, Altea and Randi again appeared on Larry King Live, and Altea again refused to answer whether or not she would take the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge.[83]
In October 2007, John Edward appeared on Headline Prime, hosted by Glenn Beck; when asked if he would take Randi's challenge, Edward responded, "It's funny. I was on Larry King Live once, and they asked me the same question. And I made a joke [then], and I'll say the same thing here: Why would I allow myself to be tested by somebody who's got an adjective as a first name?"[84]
Randi asked British businessman Jim McCormick, the inventor of the bogus ADE 651 bomb detector, to take the challenge in October 2008.[85] Randi called the ADE 651 "a useless quack device which cannot perform any other function than separating naive persons from their money. It's a fake, a scam, a swindle, and a blatant fraud. Prove me wrong and take the million dollars."[86] There was no response from McCormick.[87] According to Iraqi investigators, the ADE 651, which was corruptly sold to the Baghdad bomb squad, was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of civilians who died as a result of terrorist bombs which were not detected at checkpoints. On April 23, 2013, McCormick was convicted of three counts of fraud at the Old Bailey in London,[88] and was subsequently sentenced to ten years imprisonment for his part in the ADE 651 scandal.[89]
Randi has been involved in a variety of legal disputes but says that he has "never paid even one dollar or even one cent to anyone who ever sued me."[5] However, he says, he has paid out large sums to personally defend himself in these suits.
According to Randi, Geller tried to sue Randi a number of times, accusing him of libel. Geller never won, save for a ruling in a Japanese court that ordered Randi to pay Geller one third of one percent of what Geller had demanded, but this ruling was canceled, and the matter dropped when Geller decided to concentrate on another legal matter.[5][91]
In 1991, Randi commented that Uri Geller's public performances were of the same quality as those found on the backs of cereal boxes. Geller sued both Randi and CSICOP. CSICOP argued that the organization was not responsible for Randi's statements. The court agreed that including CSICOP was frivolous and dropped them from the action, leaving Randi to face the action alone. Geller was ordered to pay substantial damages to CSICOP.[92][93] Randi and Geller subsequently settled their dispute out of court, the details of which have been kept confidential. The settlement also included an agreement that Geller would not pursue Randi for the award in the Japanese case or other outstanding cases.
In 1996, Baltimore District Court found Randi liable for defaming Eldon Byrd for calling him a "convicted child molester" because, although Byrd had been found guilty of child pornography offences and admitted to molestation, the admission was part of a plea bargain so he was not actually convicted.[citation needed] No damages were awarded to Byrd.[94]
Late in 1996, Randi launched a libel suit against a Toronto-area psychic named Earl Gordon Curley.[95] Curley had made multiple objectionable comments about Randi on Usenet. Despite suggesting to Randi on Usenet that Randi should sue – Curley's comments implying that if Randi did not sue, then his allegations must be true – Curley seemed entirely surprised when Randi actually retained Toronto's largest law firm and initiated legal proceedings. The suit was eventually dropped in 1998 when Earl Curley died at the age of 51.[96]
Allison DuBois, on whose life the television series Medium was based, threatened Randi with legal action for using a photo of her from her website in his December 17, 2004, commentary without her permission.[97] Randi removed the photo and now uses a caricature of DuBois when mentioning her on his site, beginning with his December 23, 2005, commentary.[98]
Sniffex, producer of a dowsing bomb detection device, sued Randi and the JREF in 2007 and lost.[99] Sniffex sued Randi for his comments regarding a government test in which the Sniffex device failed. The company was later investigated and charged with fraud.[99]
In 1987, Randi became a naturalized citizen of the United States.[100] Randi has said that one reason he became an American citizen was an incident while on tour with Alice Cooper where the Royal Canadian Mounted Police searched the band's lockers during a performance. Nothing was found, yet the RCMP destroyed the room.[101]
In February 2006, Randi underwent coronary artery bypass surgery.[102] In early February 2006, he was declared to be in stable condition and "receiving excellent care" with his recovery proceeding well. The weekly commentary updates to his website were made by guests while he was hospitalized.[103] Randi recovered after his surgery and was able to help organize and attend the 2007 Amaz!ng Meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada (an annual convention of scientists, magicians, skeptics, atheists and freethinkers).[104]
Randi was diagnosed with intestinal cancer in June 2009.[105] He had a ping pong ball-sized tumor removed from his intestines during laparoscopic surgery. He announced the diagnosis a week later at The Amaz!ng Meeting 7 as well as the fact that he was scheduled to begin chemotherapy in the following weeks.[106] He also said at the conference: "One day, I'm gonna die. That's all there is to it. Hey, it's too bad, but I've got to make room. I'm using a lot of oxygen and such – I think it's good use of oxygen myself, but of course, I'm a little prejudiced on the matter."[106] Randi also said that after he is gone he does not want his fans to bother with a museum of magic named after him or burying him in a fancy tomb. Instead, he said, "I want to be cremated, and I want my ashes blown in Uri Geller's eyes."[106] Randi underwent his final chemotherapy session on December 31, 2009, as he explained in a January 12, 2010, video in which he related that his chemotherapy experience was not as unpleasant as he had imagined.[105] In a video posted April 12, 2010, Randi stated that he has been given a clean bill of health.[107]
In a March 21, 2010, blog entry, Randi came out as gay, a move he explained was inspired by seeing the 2008 biographical drama film Milk, in which Sean Penn portrayed Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California.[108][109] During an appearance at the annual skeptics' convention The Amazing Meeting (TAM) on July 12, 2013, Randi announced that he and his partner of 27 years, artist Deyvi Peña, aka José Luis Álvarez, had been married in Washington, D.C., 10 days previously.[110][111][112]

James Randi (born Randall James Hamilton Zwinge; August 7, 1928) is a Canadian-American stage magician and scientific skeptic best known as a challenger of paranormal claims and pseudoscience. Randi is the founder of the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF). Randi began his career as a magician, as The Amazing Randi, but after retiring at age 60, he began investigating paranormal, occult, and supernatural claims, which he collectively calls "woo-woo." Although often referred to as a "debunker," Randi rejects that title owing to its perceived bias, instead describing himself as an "investigator." He has written about the paranormal, skepticism, and the history of magic. He was a frequent guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and was occasionally featured on the television program Penn & Teller: Bullshit!.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          James Randi has an international reputation as a magician and escape artist, but today he is best known as the world's most tireless investigator and demystifier of paranormal and pseudoscientific claims.Randi has pursued "psychic" spoonbenders, exposed the dirty tricks of faith healers, investigated homeopathic water "with a memory," and generally been a thorn in the sides of those who try to pull the wool over the public's eyes in the name of the supernatural.He has received numerous awards and recognitions, including a Fellowship from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in 1986.On October 19, 1993, the PBS-TV "NOVA" program broadcast a one-hour special dealing with Randi's life work, particularly with his investigations of Uri Geller and various occult and healing claims being made by scientists in Russia.He is the author of numerous books, including The Truth About Uri Geller, The Faith Healers, Flim-Flam!, and An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural. His lectures and television appearances have delighted - and vexed - audiences around the world.In 1996, the James Randi Education Foundation was established to further Randi's work. Randi's long-standing challenge to psychics now stands as a $1,000,000 prize administered by the Foundation. It remains unclaimed.
      Has successfully debunked claims by self-professed psychics, faith-healers, and conspiracy theorists.
      Randi broke Houdini's underwater record when he was sealed in a metal coffin at the bottom of a swimming pool for 104 minutes.
      Currently in charge of the James Randi Educational Foundation which promotes critical thinking. The Foundation also offers one million US dollars to anyone who can show evidence of any paranormal, supernatural, or occult power or event. [April 2004]
      If the audience likes you, they want you to win. It's not a case of: "We'll see whether he can do this. No. We'll see him do this. We want him to be successful. He's up against the odds." They're pulling for the underdog.
      I don't expect that the million will ever be won, simply because there is no confirming evidence for any paranormal claims to date.

James Randi's Real NameRandall James Hamilton ZwingeAliasesThe Amazing RandiOccupationInvestigator, Scientific Skeptic, Magician, Escapologist, Author, LecturerPlace of BirthToronto, Ontario, CanadaHeight5' 2"EyesBlueHairWhiteAbilitiesJames Randi possesses the ability of superior knowledge and skill in the arts of conjuring, escapology, paranormal and pseudoscience. Interesting FactDuring Alice Cooper's 1973–1974 tour, Randi performed as the dentist and executioner on stage, and designed and built several of the stage props, including the guillotine.
James Randi was born Randall James Hamilton Zwinge on August 7, 1928 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.Randi turned to magic books while spending 1 year in a body cast following a bicycle accident. He amazed doctors who expected he would never walk again.Although a brilliant student, Randi often skipped school, and he dropped out of high school at 17 to perform as a conjurer in a carnival roadshow.In his twenties, Randi posed as a psychic to establish that they were actually doing simple tricks and briefly wrote an astrological column in the Canadian tabloid Midnight under the name "Zo-ran," by simply shuffling up items from newspaper astrology columns and pasting them randomly into a column.In his thirties, Randi worked in Philippine night clubs and all across Japan. He witnessed many tricks that were presented as being supernatural. One of his earliest reported experiences is that of seeing an evangelist using the "one-ahead" routine to convince churchgoers of his divine powers.
Randi began working as a professional stage magician and escapologist in 1946, under his name Randall Zwinge. He first appeared as "The Amazing Randi" on a TV show entitled Wonderama in 1967.On February 7, 1956, he performed live on The Today Show, remaining in a sealed metal coffin submerged in a hotel swimming pool for 104 minutes, breaking what was said to be Houdini's record of 93 minutes.James Randi went on to host "The Amazing Randi Show" on New York radio station WOR in the mid 1960s.This radio show, which filled Long John Nebel's old slot with similar content after Nebel went to WNBC in 1962, had frequent pro-paranormal guests, including Randi's then-friend James Moseley.
He went on several world tours and also hosted numerous television specials, including Wonderama from 1967 to 1972, and as host of a failed revival of the 1950s children's show The Magic Clown in 1970That same year, Randi gained international attention in 1972 as he challenged the claims of Uri Geller. Randi accused Geller of being nothing more than a charlatan who uses standard magic tricks to accomplish his allegedly paranormal feats, and he backed up his claims in the book, "The Truth About Uri Geller."Geller unsuccessfully sued Randi for $15 million in 1991. Geller's suit against the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) was thrown out in 1995, and he was ordered to pay $120,000 for filing a frivolous lawsuit.Randi was a founding member and prominent figure of CSICOP. During the period when Geller was filing numerous civil suits against him, CSICOP's leadership, wanting to avoid becoming a target of Geller's litigation, requested that Randi refrain from commenting on Geller. 
Randi refused and resigned. However, he still maintains a respectful relationship with the group and frequently writes articles for its magazine.Randi has gone on to pen several books attacking beliefs and claims regarding the paranormal. He also created "Project Alpha" which demonstrated the shortcomings of many paranormal research projects at the university level. Randi has appeared on numerous TV shows, sometimes to directly debunk and challenge the claimed abilities of alleged guest psychic's and mediums and faith healers, including Peter Popoff, James Hydrick, Sylvia Browne, James Van Praagh and John Edward.
In 1996, Randi established the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF). This organization supports research into paranormal claims and attempts to test them in controlled experimental conditions, offering the $1,000,000 prize to anyone who can demonstrate a supernatural ability under agreed-upon scientific testing criteria. No one has passed a preliminary test, which is set up and agreed upon between both Randi and the applicant. Randi updates the JREF's website with written commentary on Fridays.He was quoted in the October 1981 issue of Fate Magazine as allegedly saying "I always have an out;" however, this magazine article was written as a result of political infighting among the members of CSICOP. Observers of the ongoing debate between skeptics and their detractors believe this quote is being misapplied, and that it refers to the fact that Randi employs safeguards against cheating. 
Such claims of Randi finding ways to avoid payment are unfounded, as the money is held in a Goldman, Sachs & Company account and withholding payment would constitute fraud on Randi's behalf.Parapsychologists generally try to downplay the Randi challenge because of these attacks on Randi's character, and also because of his harsh, uncompromising style of writing and presentation, which has won him enemies among those who claim to be paranormal experts.Randi's supporters note that there are other skeptical organizations that have their own similar standing offers to prove the existence of paranormal abilities, and anyone claiming to be an expert in their field of the paranormal can easily apply for any of these other prizes, avoiding Randi altogether.James Randi contributes a regular column, titled "'Twas Brillig," to The Skeptics Society's Skeptic Magazine.Information excerpts: Wikipedia

Legendary skeptic James Randi has devoted his life to debunking frauds and investigating paranormal and pseudoscientific claims.
James Randi has an international reputation as a magician and escape artist, but he is perhaps best known as the world's most tireless investigator and demystifier of paranormal and pseudoscientific claims.Randi has pursued "psychic" spoonbenders, exposed the dirty tricks of faith healers, investigated homeopathic water "with a memory," and generally been a thorn in the sides of those who try to pull the wool over the public's eyes in the name of the supernatural. He has received numerous awards and recognitions, including a MacArthur "genius" grant in 1986. He's the author of numerous books, including The Truth About Uri Geller, The Faith Healers, Flim-Flam!, and An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural. In 1996, the James Randi Education Foundation  was established to further Randi's work. Randi's long-standing challenge to psychics now stands as a $1,000,000 prize  administered by the Foundation. It remains unclaimed. 
One thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead. To my innocent mind, ‘dead’ implies incapable of communicating.
[Psychics] use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do — the same physical methods, the same psychological methods — and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people around the earth, to their detriment.

Skeptical Investigations > Investigating Skeptics > Examining Skeptics > A Skeptical Look At James Randi
Years ago, when I  was a full-fledged skeptic, atheist, and rationalist, I  read James Randi's 1980 book Flim-Flam! Psychics, ESP,  Unicorns and other Delusions. Randi is an  accomplished magician and a professional skeptic,  dedicating to disproving any and all claims of what he  considers pseudoscience. In line with this agenda, and as  its title suggests, Flim-Flam is a concerted attack on miscellaneous purported irrationalities -  everything from the pop-culture writings of Erich von  Daniken to the more serious investigations of  professional parapsychologists. I enjoyed the book, which  reinforced my belief system at the time.
 Recently  I picked up Flim-Flam again. Having changed my  mind about many things over the past twenty years, I  responded to it much differently this time. I was  particularly struck by the book's hectoring, sarcastic  tone. Randi pictures psychic researchers as medieval  fools clad in "caps and bells" and likens the  delivery of an announcement at a parapsychology  conference to the birth of "Rosemary's Baby."  After debunking all manner of alleged frauds, he opens  the book's epilogue with the words, "The tumbrels  now stand empty but ready for another trip to the  square" - a reference to the French Revolution,  in which carts ("tumbrels") of victims were  driven daily to the guillotine. Randi evidently pictures himself as the executioner who lowers the blade. In  passing, two points might be made about this metaphor:  the French Revolution was a product of "scientific  rationalism" run amok ... and most of its victims  were innocent. 
 Still,  the tedious nastiness of Flim-Flam does not tell  us anything about its accuracy. Intrigued, I decided to  check out a few of Randi's claims in detail.
I  chose to focus on Chapter Eight, Randi's dissection of  the experiments of Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, two  well-known parapsychologists. Randi calls them "the  Laurel and Hardy of psi" and proceeds to argue that  their experiments were a tissue of ineptitude,  gullibility, and dishonesty.
 The  first thing I noticed was that Randi never gives any  indication that Targ and Puthoff have any scientific  credentials or accomplishments. The casual reader could  be forgiven for assuming that they are not  "real" scientists at all. For the record, Targ  is a physicist credited with inventing the FM laser, the  high-power gas-tranport laser, and the tunable plasma  oscillator. Puthoff, also a physicist, invented the  tunable infra-red laser and is widely known for his  theoretical work on quantum vacuum states and the zero  point field. (see The Field, by Lynne McTaggart,  for an overview of Puthoff's work in quantum phyics.) If these two are "Laurel and Hardy," at least they  come with good résumés. Randi, by contrast, has no  scientific training.
 Randi starts  off by telling us how Targ and Puthoff took a professed  psychic, Ingo Swann, to Stanford University, where, they  said, Swann used his psychic abilities to affect the  operation of a magnetometer. According to Randi,  "the report was all wet." He knows this because  he contacted Dr. Arthur Hebard, "the builder of the  device, who was present and has excellent recollections  of what took place." Hebard, Randi says disputes the  Targ-Puthoff account. He is quoted as saying, "It's  a lie. You can say it any way you want, but that's what I  call a lie." 
 First,  he seems to make a rather basic error when he says that both Targ and Puthoff were present for this experiment.  As best I can determine, Puthoff conducted the  experiment, which took place in June, 1972, without  Targ's assistance. Targ had met Puthoff prior to this  time, but their work together apparently did not begin  until a few months later.
 That's  a small point. Far more important is the matter of Dr. Hebard's testimony. There's another side to the story,  which I found in Chapter  17  of Psychic  Breakthroughs Today ( Quoted by Uri Geller ) by D. Scott Rogo. Rogo, who died  in 1990 at the age of forty, was a prolific journalist  and researcher of psychic phenomena. He wrote numerous  popular books, some of which have been used as college  texts. He also published research papers in peer-reviewed  parapsychology journals. Although Rogo was sometimes  criticized for tackling overly esoteric subjects, he had  a reputation for honesty and was respected for his  willingness to do hands-on investigation and field work,  rather than relying on armchair appraisals. A Scott Rogo  tribute and bibliography can be found at www.tricksterbook.com/ArticlesOnline/RogoObit.htm 
 Rogo  writes, "There obviously exist several discrepancies between Dr Puthoff's views on what happened during this experiment, and what Randi claims Dr Hebard told him. So  to clarify the matter, I decided to get in touch with Dr  Hebard myself. I finally tracked him down at the Bell  Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey. He was  very willing to discuss the Swann magnetometer  demonstration with me, and professed to be very  interested in parapsychology." Hebard's interest in  the paranormal contradicts Randi's statement that Hebard,  "not being a reader of far-out literature," was  unaware of Targ and Puthoff's claims.
 Rogo  acknowledges that Hebard's account differs in some respects from Puthoff's. "Dr Hebard denied in no  uncertain terms, however, Randi's claim that Swann was  never asked to 'stop the field charge' being recorded  from the magnetometer. He easily recalled that he had  suggested that it would be a fascinating effect if Swann  could produce it . . . which, of course, he actually did soon after the suggestion was made. Randi also directly  quotes Dr Hebard as calling some of Targ and Puthoff's  claims 'lies'. Dr Hebard was very annoyed by this claim  since, as he explained to me, Randi had tried to get him  to make this charge and he had refused. Dr Hebard later  signed a statement to this effect for me." (ellipsis  in original.)
As  for the discrepancies between Hebard's and Puthoff's accounts, Rogo reports that in a subsequent meeting with  Puthoff, he was shown "the actual graphed print-outs  given by the magnetometer during the Swann  demonstrations. The records supported Dr Puthoff's  contention more than they did Dr Hebard's." 
 So  far, then, the best we can say is that Randi's criticism  of Puthoff (and Targ, who apparently wasn't even involved  in the magnetometer experiment) is far from the last word  on the subject.
 Randi  proceeds to launch a comprehensive critique of Targ and Puthoff's article "Information Transmission under  Conditions of Sensory Shielding," which appeared in  the October 18, 1974, issue of the respected journal Nature.   The article details experiments involving, among other participants, the professed psychic Uri Geller.
 Randi's  take on this series of experiments is withering. He skewers Targ and Puthoff as "bunglers." He  reports that their experiments were conducted in a  chaotic atmosphere conducive to cheating. He says that a  hole in the wall of Geller's isolation room enabled him  to spy on the scientists during their ESP experiments. He  says that Targ and Puthoff falsified the results of the  tests by omitting failed experiments that would have  lowered Geller's averages to the level of chance.  Further, he says that the scoring of Geller's  performances was mishandled, generating higher scores  than Geller deserved. 
 The  question naturally arises: How does Randi know all this, since, as he admits, "I've never even set foot on  the sacred grounds of SRI [Stanford Research Institute,  where the experiments were conducted"? He explains  that he was given inside information by "an  individual" who claimed to represent dozens of SRI  scientists. This group, which worked in secret and even  adopted a code name (Broomhilda), passed the information to Randi. 
Unfortunately,  Randi never names this individual or any other members of  the Broomhilda group. He says that "Broomhilda verified for me much of the information that I had been  holding on to for years," but where did he get this  earlier information in the first place? "That  data," he says, "now moved from the status of hearsay to documented fact." But documented  is hardly a term applicable to either the initial  information, which is never specified, or the Broomhilda  information, which came from an anonymous source. He  adds, "Additional facts were elicited during  conversations and correspondence with individuals. Many of these persons were not aware of Broomhilda and were  acting on their own. Their completely independent input  supported Broomhilda's charges. Taken together," he  concludes, "the information from all sources  amounted to quite an indictment."
Maybe  so, but it's an indictment that would never hold up in  court. The reader is expected to take Randi's word that  his unidentified sources are trustworthy - and that  the sources themselves are well-informed about  experimental procedures they may or may not have  witnessed.
 Thus  when Randi alleges that "hundreds of [failed]  experiments that were done by SRI ... were never  reported," we must take the statement on faith, as  it is unsupported by any documentation. Similarly, when  Randi says definitively, "All the other tests [i.e., the successful ones] lacked proper controls and were  useless," we search in vain for any footnote to back  up this assertion.
A posting  www.psicounsel.com/ I  found on a message board sums up the situation nicely:  "Claims of poor scientific method leveled at the experimenters have been shown to be mainly  unsubstantiated personal opinion and second-hand 'Chinese  Whispers.'" (Chinese Whispers is the British  equivalent of the American game, 'Telephone'.) It might be  worth adding that critics of paranormal phenomena, like  Randi, are forever decrying any reliance on  "anecdotal evidence," which is precisely what  the bulk of Randi's argument consists of.
 Randi  does produce two individuals willing to go on the record  - Charles Rebert and Leon Otis, both of whom were  SRI psychologists. Rebert and Otis apparently disagreed  with the Targ-Puthoff conclusions; indeed, Randi tells us  that "a horrified Rebert also heard that Targ and  Puthoff were going to proclaim these erroneous findings  before Stanford University's psychology department, and  he forbade such a blunder. The talk was canceled."  But this only tells us that there was a dispute among the  scientists at SRI. Rebert and Otis ran some unsuccessful  tests with Geller and decided that he was a fraud. Targ  and Puthoff ran what they regarded as successful tests  and decided that, in some areas at least, Geller had  legitimate psychic powers. Nothing in Randi's text  establishes which conclusion was correct. 
 Randi  goes on to report that after he had criticized Geller in  an earlier book, Targ and Puthoff "issued a 'fact  sheet' in rebuttal to twenty-four" of his points.  According to Randi, "This attempt was a failure, and  in response to one claim that the SRI tests were done under tight controls, a scientist who was there declared  flatly, 'This is b.s. As far as my colleagues and I are  concerned, none of the experiments met accepted  scientific protocol. "I will not burden you," Randi  concludes, "with the other twenty-three points; they are as easily demolished."
Well,  hold on. A quotation from yet another anonymous source  ("a scientist who was there") hardly  constitutes a demolition job, especially when the  scientist's argument consists of an unsupported assertion  ("none of the experiments met accepted scientific  protocol"). Personally, I would have welcomed the "burden" of the other twenty-three points and  of Randi's detailed and carefully documented rebuttals.
 Some  idea of the counter-arguments to Randi's claims can be obtained by taking another look at D. Scott Rogo, who  earlier showed the initiative to track down Dr. Hebard.  Unlike Randi, who, as we have seen, had "never even  set foot" inside the research facility, Rogo visited  SRI on June 12, 1981. He found that Randi had  misrepresented the hole in the wall of the isolation room  through which Geller was supposedly able to spy on the researchers. The hole, a conduit for cables, is depicted  in Flim-Flam as being three and a half inches wide  and therefore offering a good view of the experimental  area where the researchers were working. Rogo found,  however, that the hole "is three-and-a-quarter  inches [wide] and extends through a twelve-and-a-half inch wall. This scopes your vision and severely limits  what you can see through it. The hole is not left open  either, since it is covered by a plate through which  cables are routinely run. Dr Puthoff and his colleague  were, however, concerned that their subject might be  ingenious enough to insert an optical probe through this  hole, so they monitored the opening throughout their telepathy experiments."
 Randi  also indicates that the hole is stationed 34 inches above the floor. Not so, says Rogo. "It isn't three feet  above the floor, but is located only a little above floor  level. The only thing you can see through it - even under  optimal conditions - is a small bit of exterior floor and  opposing wall. (The viewing radius is only about 20°,  and the targets for the Geller experiments were hung on a different wall completely.) I also discovered during my  trip to SRI that an equipment rack was situated in front  of the hole throughout the Geller work, which obstructed  any view through it even further. I ended my little  investigation by talking with two people who were present  during these critical experiments. They both agreed that wires were running through the hole - therefore  totally blocking it - during the time of the Geller  experiments." 
 It  would appear that the hole in the isolation booth's wall  poses considerably less of a problem than the holes in  Randi's arguments. 
 By  now, I felt that Randi's credibility was in doubt. He had committed careless errors of fact, had quite possibly misrepresented and misquoted Hebard, and had made unsupported assertions based on rumors. I wondered what  Targ and Puthoff have to say about all this. The only  responses from either of them that I could find online  were part of a long essay by Winston Wu, 'Debunking  Common Skeptical Arguments Against Paranormal and Psychic  Phenomena' www.victorzammit.com/skeptics/winston.html ,  the  relevant part is    Argument 18  Puthoff is quoted as  saying the following: 
 "In  Flim- Flam, [Randi] gives something like 28  debunking points, if my memory serves me correctly. I had  the opportunity to confront Randi at a Parapsychology  Association conference with proof in hand, and in  tape-recorded interaction he admitted he was wrong on all  the points. He even said he would correct them for the upcoming paperback being published by the CSICOP group.  [He did not] ...
"The  truth of the matter is that none of Randi's claimed  suspected inadequate controls actually had anything to do  with the experiments, which of course Randi was not there  to know of. This has been independently reported by Scott  Rogo somewhere in the literature, who came out  specifically to check each of Randi's guesses about  inadequate controls and found them inapplicable under the  conditions in which the tests were conducted. In fact,  all of Randi's suggestions were amateurish compared to  the sophisticated steps we took, suspecting as we did  everything from magician's tricks to an Israeli  intelligence scam....
"In  case one thinks that it was just a case of our opinions  vs. his opinions," Puthoff continues, "we chose  for the list of incorrect points only those that could be  independently verified. Examples: [Randi] said that in  our Nature paper we verified Geller's  metal-bending. Go to the paper, and you see that we said  we were not able to obtain evidence for this. He said  that a film of the Geller experiment made at SRI by famed  photographer Zev Pressman was not made by him, but by us  and we just put his name on it. We showed up with an  affidavit by Pressman saying that indeed he did make the  film." 
There  is no way for me to verify Puthoff's statement that he  tape-recorded Randi's concession of defeat "on all  the points." This has to stand as an unsupported  assertion, just like Randi's own arguments. But it is  possible to take a closer look at Puthoff's last two  claims. 
 First,  Puthoff insists that his and Targ's Nature article  does not endorse Geller's alleged metal-bending. This is  accurate, as you can see for yourself by reading the  article   www.heart7.net/mcf/hambone/g3.html .  Puthoff and Targ write, "It has been widely reported that Geller has  demonstrated the ability to bend metal by paranormal  means. Although metal bending by Geller has been observed  in our laboratory, we have not been able to combine such  observations with adequately controlled experiments to  obtain data sufficient to support the paranormal  hypothesis." 
On  the other hand, I have not found any statement by Randi  in Flim-Flam to the effect that Targ and Puthoff  "had verified Geller's metal-bending." He  attacks the Targ-Puthoff experiments on other grounds. Of  course, he may have made this statement elsewhere, but as  far as I can tell, Puthoff is rebutting a point Randi  never made. 
How  about Puthoff's second claim, regarding the SRI film?  Randi certainly does make this an issue in Flim-Flam.  Targ and Puthoff, he writes, "appended to [the film]  - without his knowledge or permission - the  name of Zev Pressman, the SRI photographer who had shot  the film.... Pressman, said Targ and Puthoff, was present  during [a particular series of] experiments. Not so, according to Pressman.... Most damning of all, Pressman  said to others at SRI that he had been told the  successful [tests] were done after he (Pressman)  had  gone home for the day. So it appears the film was a  reenactment ... Pressman did not even know that Targ and  Puthoff were issuing a statement, he did not sign it, and  he did not give them permission to use his name. He knew  nothing about most of what appeared under his name, and he disagreed with the part that he did know about."  [italics in original] 
Here  we have Randi saying that this photographer, Pressman, was duped and used by the experimenters, while Puthoff  says that Pressman signed an affidavit swearing that  "indeed he did make the film." Is there any way  to resolve this?
 A  further Web search turned up Chapter  14 www.uri-geller.com/geller-effect/tge14.htm  of The Geller Effect. Part One of this book is written by Uri Geller. Part Two,  which includes Chapter 14, was written by Guy Lyon  Playfair. Living up to his name, Playfair offers an  even-handed presentation of the various controversies  surrounding the flamboyant and eccentric Geller.
 Playfair  writes, "[Randi] turned, in a later book, Flim-Flam,  to the professional photographer who had made the film, a  Stanford employee named Zev Pressman, with an  extraordinary series of unfounded allegations....
"Pressman  flatly denied all of Randi's allegations in two public statements, neither of which was even mentioned in the  1982 re-issue of the book. 'I made the film,' said  Pressman, 'and my name appeared with my full knowledge  and permission . . . Nothing was restaged or specially  created . . . I have never met nor spoken to nor  corresponded with Randi. The 'revelations' he attributes  to me are pure fiction.'" 
 It  is true that no mention is made of these "two public  statements" in Flim-Flam's 1982 edition  - the edition I own.
For  corroborating testimony, I turned once again to the indefatigable Scott Rogo, who investigated this claim  just as he had looked into Dr. Hebard's testimony and the  infamous hole in the wall. 
 Rogo  writes, "I spoke directly with Mr Pressman on 5  January 1981 and he was quite interested when I told him  about Randi's book. He denied that he had spoken to the  magician. When I read him the section of Randi's book  dealing with his alleged 'expose' of the Targ-Puthoff  film, he became very vexed. He firmly backed up the  authenticity of the film, told me how he had taken it on  the spot, and labeled Randi's allegation as a total  fabrication. [His own descriptive language was a little  more colourful!]" Rogo also reports that Puthoff  showed him Pressman's signed affidavit. 
 How  could Randi's conversation with Pressman be so different from Rogo's? The truth is, Randi does not appear to have  had a conversation with Pressman at all. Take another  look at the quote from Flim-Flam. The key words  are: "Most damning of all, Pressman said to others  at SRI ..." 
 Evidently,  then, Randi's source is not Pressman himself, but unnamed  "others at SRI" who passed on this information  to Randi. Another round of Chinese Whispers, it seems.  
 At  this point Randi ends his discussion of the Geller  experiments and proceeds to criticize Targ and Puthoff's  later work, as well as the work of another researcher,  Charles Tart. Dealing with these criticisms would require  another essay of equal length to this one, so I will stop  here. The reader who wants to go further is invited to read Randi's  Flim-Flam and then click on any of  the links inserted throughout this essay and listed  below. Or just search the Web for the keywords Randi,  Targ, Puthoff, etc., and see what comes up. 
 Before  I began this modest online research project for a rainy afternoon, I had mixed feelings about Randi. I saw him as  closed-minded and supercilious, but I also assumed he was  sincere and, by his own lights, honest. Now, having  explored his contribution to the Targ-Puthoff controversy  in some detail, I am thoroughly unimpressed. Randi comes  across as a bullying figure, eager to attack and  ridicule, willing to distort and even invent evidence  - in short, the sort of person who will do anything  to prevail in a debate, whether by fair means or foul. 
 The  title of his book thus takes on a new and unintended meaning. From what I can tell, James Randi really is the Flim-Flam  man.

James Randi Bio  Detail Biography Recognized internationally for his tireless and successful investigations of psychic, supernatural, and "magical" claims, and dealing with subjects that border on both science and mythology, James Randi has become known as one of America's most original and fearless thinkers, winning him the prestigious MacArthur Foundation "Genius" Fellowship. As an investigator of unusual claims on the brink of the new Millennium, he has become accustomed to incredible examples of medieval thinking. In 1972 two scientists from the Stanford Research Institute validated Uri Geller's claims of paranormal powers. As a result, Geller quickly became an international celebrity using his "psychic" abilities to bend spoons and move objects. In a effort to expose the truth about Geller, Randi went to Johnny Carson. Geller squirmed and fumbled through a disastrous 22 minute appearance. Try as he might, he was unable to perform a single feat. Unbeknownst to him, Carson's producers, consulting with Randi, had set up safeguards against cheating. This direct assault to scientific truth appalled Randi and many in the scientific community. He became a founding fellow of CSICOP, the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, that included such luminaries as astronomer Carl Sagan, Nobel Laureate physicist Murray Gell-Mann, psychologist B.F. Skinner, and noted science and science-fiction author Isaac Asimov. So what drives James Randi to lead the search for scientific truth? "Acceptance of nonsense as a harmless aberration can be dangerous to all of us," declares Randi. "We live in a society that is enlarging the boundaries of knowledge at an unprecedented rate, and we cannot keep up with much more than a small portion of what is made available to us. To mix that knowledge with childish notions of magic and fantasy is to cripple our perception of the world around us. We must reach for the truth, not for the ghosts of dead absurdities." "I regard Randi as a national treasure, and perhaps oneof the remaining antidotes that may prevent the rottingof the American mind."-Arthur C. Clarke   In his never-ending search for truth he has exposed a parade of would-be psychics, mediums, faith healers and the like. In 1986 he exposed Peter Popoff, a TV evangelist with self-proclaimed divine powers. With help from volunteers, a video camera, and a radio scanner, he showed the world that Popoff's "power" was actually nothing more than a miniature receiver hidden in his ear, through which he received instructions from his wife Elizabeth backstage, who had previously pumped chosen members of the audience for information. Randi is a prolific writer, having authored nine books, and numerous articles and essays for publications such as Time Magazine, Scientific American Magazine, Technology Review, The New York Times, and many other scientific and popular journals. He has written articles and definitions for Encyclopaedia Britannica Medical & Health Annual, Encyclopedia Americana, and Compton's Encyclopedia. Randi is also regularly featured on television nationally and internationally, most recently on shows such as NOVA, DateLine, 20/20, and Larry King. He has even had his own television specials in nine different countries. "Perhaps nobody in the world understands both the virtuesand the failings of the paranormal as well as Randi does. Hisqualifications as a rational human being are unparalleled"-Isaac Asimov  He is a regularly requested speaker, having lectured and/or performed at such places as The White House, Cornell, Harvard, MIT, Oxford, Princeton, Stanford, and Yale. He has been a speaker at such organizations as the Exxon Research Club, General Electric, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Mensa, NASA, the National Geographic Society, the National Science Foundation, and The Smithsonian Institution, to name only a few. Our universe and our lives are filled with mysterious and magical things yet to be discovered. Randi does not object to faith in these wonders as long as that faith does not insist on being taken as proven. But when blind belief refuses scientific inquiry, he bristles, "We have fought long and hard to escape from medieval superstition. I, for one, do not wish to go back." Full-length profiles of James Randi appeared in the 1998 World Encyclopedia's Annual Science Supplement, Scientific American Magazine, July, 1995, and in Time Magazine, June 13, 1988. More information can also be found in most biographical listings, including the current "Who's Who in America," "Who's Who in Entertainment," "Who's Who in the East," and the Cambridge "Men of Achievement."
