Peter David Schiff (/ˈʃɪf/; born March 23, 1963) is an American businessman, investment broker, author and financial commentator. Schiff is CEO and chief global strategist[3] of Euro Pacific Capital Inc., a broker-dealer based in Westport, Connecticut.[4]
Schiff has appeared as a guest on financial television shows and been quoted in major print publications. He is host of The Peter Schiff Show, an audio show broadcast on terrestrial and internet radio[5] and was formerly host of an internet podcast called Wall Street Unspun[6] now archived as podcasts.[5][7] Schiff acquired significant internet fame for correctly predicting in 2005-2007 the collapse in U.S. housing prices that would occur in 2008 and the global financial crisis that would ensue. In 2010, Schiff ran in the Republican primary for the United States Senate seat in Connecticut, but lost to Linda McMahon.
Schiff is known for his bearish views on the US economy and US dollar, and his bullish views on commodities, foreign stocks and foreign currencies. Schiff also voices strong support for the Austrian School of economic thought, first introduced to him by his father.[8][9]
Schiff was born in New Haven, Connecticut. His father is Irwin Schiff, a prominent figure in the U.S. tax protester movement, who is currently serving a 13-year sentence for tax evasion in federal prison.[10][11] Peter Schiff attended Beverly Hills High School in California,[12] and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1987 with a BS in accounting and finance.
In 1996, Schiff and a partner acquired an inactive brokerage firm, renamed it Euro Pacific Capital, and began operating it from a small office in Los Angeles,[13] relocating the firm to Darien, CT in 2005.[14] Euro Pacific Capital Inc. is currently headquartered in Westport, Connecticut, with offices in Scottsdale, Arizona, Boca Raton, Florida, Newport Beach, California, Los Angeles and New York City.[15] It specializes in non-U.S. markets and securities.
In an August 2006 interview Schiff said: "The United States is like the Titanic and I am here with the lifeboat trying to get people to leave the ship... I see a real financial crisis coming for the United States."[16] On December 31, 2006 in a telecast debate on Fox News, Schiff forecast that "what's going to happen in 2007 is that real estate prices", which had peaked at the end of 2005,[17] "are going to come crashing back down to Earth".
In his 2007 book Crash Proof, Schiff wrote that United States economic policies were fundamentally unsound.[18] Since then, he has stated many times that, without a change in U.S. government economic policy, there will be hyperinflation in the U.S.[18][19] and that the imbalance between the amount of goods the U.S. consumed and what it produced would eventually lead to problems for the U.S. economy. As a remedy Schiff favored increased personal savings and production which he said would stimulate economic growth.[20] Schiff cited the U.S.'s low personal savings rate as one of the causes of its transformation from the world's largest creditor nation in the 1970s to the largest debtor nation in the year 2000.[21] Schiff attributed the low savings rate to what he asserts are high inflation and artificially low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve.[22]
In 2008 and 2010 appearances on Fox News and financial news network CNBC, Schiff mentioned factors such as speculation and "the absence of lending standards"[23][24] as factors which had contributed to the housing crisis which began in 2007. On December 13, 2007 in an interview on the Bloomberg TV show Open Exchange, Schiff further added that he felt that the crisis would extend to the credit card lending industry, and called consumer credit "a cancer on the free-market economy." Schiff said that interest rates would rise, the Dollar would "collapse" and that all classes of Dollar-denominated assets would fall in value relative to non-US assets. He predicted "a huge crisis" and "the blow-up of credit card finance" in 2008, with the result that consumer credit card spending limits would be "slashed" by card issuers, and said that Americans would no longer be able to make purchases using their credit card lines. Referring to the housing market, Schiff went on to criticize the policy of the Bush Administration to "villify and threaten the lenders" for reckless borrowing.[25] Following this observation, it was soon reported that "Defaults – when lenders essentially give up hope of ever being repaid and write off the debt – rose 18 percent to almost $961 million in October" according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings by 17 large credit card trusts examined by the Associated Press.[26]
In a March 2009 speech Schiff said that it would be impossible for the U.S. debt to China to be repaid unless the U.S. dollar's value is substantially diluted through inflation. In September 2009 Schiff said that he foresaw gold at over $5,000 an ounce in the next couple years, and that the stock market rally which began that year was a "rally in a bear market".[27] Later in November of that year, Schiff said that five stocks he picked for Fortune Magazine in January 2009 were "up collectively 360%."[28]
Peter Schiff believes that minimum wage laws hurt the poorest and least skilled by pricing them out of the job market and reducing their opportunities to acquire the skills which would make them more employable.[29] In March, 2011, he stated that the U.S. should abolish the corporate income tax and the home mortgage interest deduction on personal income tax.[30]
In August, 2012, Schiff criticized the Ryan Budget Plan, saying it is "too little too late." Referring to Ryan's plan to save Medicare, Schiff said, "why would we want to preserve it? It's a ponzi scheme ... What we really need is real Medicare cuts today for people who are already on the system."[31]
On October 25, 2012 Peter Schiff said that the price of gold, which was then around $1700 per ounce, would rise to $5,000 per ounce within the following two years.[32] On April 16, 2013, Schiff told a CNBC interviewer that gold may go to $1000 an ounce but that if it does, the price will present a buying opportunity because it will subsequently rise to $2000 per ounce.[33] In June he claimed a "vicious" gold rally was coming,[34] the biggest in history;[35] in August he reiterated that a "spectacular" gold rally was coming;[36] and, in September, he claimed that, whatever the Fed did, gold would rally.[37] In October, however, outflows from gold investment funds soared,[38] and, in December 2013—after the Fed announced the start of its tapering of monetary stimulus—gold futures lost 2.7%, prices having dropped by almost 30% over the year to a three-year low on 19 December, where they remained on course to clock their first decline in 13 years,[39] and were kicked into 2014 with a "drubbing".[40] Goldman Sachs predicted gold would "grind lower" over the course of 2014.[41]
Schiff's warnings of a coming economic collapse earned him the moniker "Dr. Doom",[13][42][43] but later articles in Business Week and other business news journals reported that Schiff "more or less accurately" predicted the financial crisis of 2007–2010, while "nearly all [macroeconomists] failed to foresee the recession despite plenty of warning signs".[13][44][45] Schiff's YouTube channel video "Peter Schiff was right" became popular in late 2008 and 2009.[46][47] It contained a compilation of his appearances on various financial TV news programs between 2005 and 2007.
In January 2009, economic blogger and investment adviser Michael Shedlock wrote: "I have talked with many who claim they have invested with Schiff and are down anywhere from 40% to 70% in 2008".[48] Later that week an article appeared in the Wall Street Journal reporting that Schiff's broker-dealer firm had "advised its clients to bet that the dollar would weaken significantly and that foreign stocks would outpace their U.S. peers"; however, the dollar later advanced against most currencies, "magnifying the losses from foreign stocks".[49] In response to Shedlock's criticism, Schiff wrote: "to examine the effectiveness of my investment strategy immediately following a major correction by looking only at those accounts who adopted the strategy at the previous peak is unfair and distortive".[50][51][52][53] In December 2012 Schiff wrote an article entitled "Mish Shedlock exposed", in which he criticized Shedlock for selective use of short-term data in the financial crisis and argued that his investment strategy had made strong returns over the long-run.[54]
Schiff's views have been criticized several times by economist Paul Krugman. In October 2010, Krugman wrote, "I keep being told that Peter Schiff has been right about everything; so, how's that hyperinflation thing going?"[55] In December 2011, Krugman quoted Peter Schiff's statement from December 2009: "I know inflation is going to get worse in 2010. Whether it’s going to run out of control or it’s going to take until 2011 or 2012, but I know we’re going to have a major currency crisis coming soon. It’s going to dwarf the financial crisis and it’s going to send consumer prices absolutely ballistic, as well as interest rates and unemployment." Krugman noted that inflation had instead remained low, and he concluded that Schiff's type of economic "model is all wrong" since it predicts that a tripling of the monetary base, such as had just occurred, must lead to "dire effects on the price level".[56] In January 2012, Schiff stated that a US debt crisis and high inflation had merely been delayed by government policy.[57] In November 2012, Krugman again criticized Schiff's predictions of high inflation and rising interest rates in America.[58]
Schiff was an economic adviser to Ron Paul's 2008 presidential campaign. In support of Paul's economic revitalization plan, Schiff said: "We need a plan that stimulates savings and production, not more of the reckless borrowing and consumption that got us into this mess in the first place. Ron Paul's plan is the only one that amounts to a step in the right direction. If you want meaningful change—for the better that is—Ron Paul is the only candidate capable of delivering it."[59]
In 2008, Schiff said that he supported the reduction of government economic regulation, and was concerned that President Obama's administration might increase such regulation.[61] Schiff says that the economic crisis of the late-2000s provides an opportunity to transition from borrowing and spending, to saving and producing. He is critical of the U.S. government's efforts to "ease the pain" with economic stimulus packages and bailouts. According to Schiff, the U.S. government's approach of replacing "legitimate savings with a printing press" could result in hyperinflation.[62]
In December 2008, some Connecticut citizens created a website encouraging Schiff to campaign against the incumbent Senator Christopher Dodd.[63][64] Approximately 5,000 people made campaign contributions using the web site.[63] On February 21, 2009, a moneybomb raised over $20,000 for Schiff's campaign.[65] In a May 2009 video blog, Schiff said that he was seriously considering a run for the senate and when questioned by a Washington Post reporter, he said the chance of him entering politics was "better than 50-50".[66] In June 2009 Schiff commissioned a poll of likely voters which indicated that he trailed Dodd in popularity by four percentage points.[67] On July 9, 2009, Schiff launched an exploratory committee and an official campaign website.[63]
In a campaign speech in Hamden, Connecticut on December 3, 2009, Schiff said "Unlike everybody else, I pretty much predicted everything that would happen in 2008 in specific and exact detail", and that "Somebody needs to be in Washington to prevent the next round of [government] stimulus from taking place, because that will be the end of it. That will be the toxin that completely destroys the economy."[68]
After giving some hints on The Daily Show[69] Schiff officially announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination on September 17, 2009, during the MSNBC Morning Joe show.[70][71][72] By October 2009 Schiff had received more than 10,000 donations and many e-mails from around the world.[63] Schiff's campaign received endorsements from Ron Paul and Steve Forbes.[73][74]
At the May 2010 Republican convention, Linda McMahon received the most delegate votes but not enough to prevent an August primary election. U.S. Rep. Rob Simmons received more than the required 15 percent of the total votes necessary to force the primary. Schiff then collected the 400 signatures necessary to be listed on the August 2010 Republican primary ballot. McMahon won the primary.[75] The general election was won by the Democratic Party primary winner, Richard Blumenthal.[76]
Schiff did not endorse McMahon in the 2012 Republican primary, instead endorsing her opponent, former Congressman Christopher Shays.[77] Shays lost the primary to McMahon.[78]
From 2005 to 2010 Schiff hosted a weekly podcast named Wall Street Unspun. In October 2010 Schiff began hosting a new radio show named The Peter Schiff Show on internet and terrestrial radio. The show has featured guests such as Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Niall Ferguson, Dennis Kucinich, Rick Santelli, John McCain and others. The Peter Schiff Show is occasionally guest-hosted by Thomas Woods, Neeraj Chaudhary, Stefan Molyneux, Larry Elder, and Andrew Schiff.
After frequent appearances on CNBC and Fox News, Schiff's television bookings dropped by 75–85% in the first half of 2009, according to his brother and public relations director, Andrew Schiff.[79] During a January 2014 appearance on The Daily Show Schiff remarked that the "mentally retarded" might be willing to work for $2 an hour if there was no minimum wage, for which he received widespread criticism.[80][81] According to Schiff, The Daily Show took his remarks out of context by cutting and editing remarks made in the context of a four-hour interview.[82] Intellectually disabled people are currently exempt from the minimum wage,[83] a fact which Mr. Schiff says he mentioned during the interview but was edited out by The Daily Show.
In August 2012, Peter Schiff replaced G. Gordon Liddy in the 10 AM to noon time slot on the Radio America network internet broadcast.[84]

Peter Schiff - Euro Pacific Capital Stock Broker, Austrian Economist, Investment Adviser and Best-Selling Author
Thanks to Peter Schiff for running for the United States Senate. You made a difference in sharing the message of liberty and sound economics to millions of people!
Peter is also featured in the independent movie Hyperinflation Nation produced by the National Inflation Association. View it in three parts - 1 2 3.
Peter David Schiff (Born March 23, 1963) is an American author, businessman, financial commentator, and was a 2010 Republican primary candidate for the United States Senate.
Schiff is president and chief global strategist of Euro Pacific Capital Inc., a broker-dealer based in Westport, Connecticut. Schiff frequently appears as a guest on CNBC, Fox News, and Bloomberg Television and is often quoted in major financial publications and is a frequent guest on internet radio as well as host of the podcast Wall Street Unspun.
He is known for his bearish views on the United States stock market, bond market, the US dollar, and the United States economy in general, which have earned him the nickname "Dr. Doom."
Schiff began his career as a financial consultant at a Shearson Lehman Brothers brokerage. In 1996 Schiff and a partner acquired a small brokerage firm that had been founded in 1980, reincorporated it in California and renamed it Euro Pacific Capital. The company now reports thousands of clients and six offices nationwide, with its headquarters in Westport, Connecticut.
According to a 2005 article in The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut Schiff relocated the firm to Darien, Connecticut to find brokers "who think like him". The New York Metropolitan Area, Schiff says, has the biggest concentration of brokers in the country, making it easier to recruit employees. The company has offices in Newport Beach, California as well as in Scottsdale, Arizona, Palm Beach, Florida, Los Angeles and New York. Euro Pacific Capital also holds the exclusive rights to broker some Perth Mint gold products in the United States.
Schiff attributes his economic forecasts to an understanding of the Austrian School, a school of economic thought generally categorized as heterodox (or non-mainstream). Schiff voices strong support for the Austrian School, and says it was first introduced to him by his father, Irwin Schiff. Schiff admits his economic views are not mainstream, and like the Austrian School, he makes judgments without a strict adherence to economic statistics.
In his 2007 book, Crash Proof, Schiff writes that the current United States economic policies are fundamentally unsound, and predicts that in the future the United States dollar will lose much of its value.
Schiff feels that the imbalance between the amount of goods the U.S. consumes and what it produces will eventually lead to problems for the U.S. economy. As a remedy Schiff favors increased personal savings and production which he says will stimulate economic growth. Schiff cites the U.S.'s low personal savings rate as one of the causes of the its transformation from the world's largest creditor nation in the 1970s to the largest debtor nation in the year 2000. Schiff attributes the low savings rate to higher inflation and the artificially low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve.
In a 2002 interview with Southland Today, Schiff predicted that the economic downtown triggered by the bursting of the stock market bubble would lead to a bear market likely to last "another 5 to 10 years." In November 2002, US stocks began a bull market uptrend which held steady for at least five years, until reversing course in 2008, when the Dow, NASDAQ, and S&P 500 began a decline to less than half of their peak 2008 values, followed in 2009 by the Dow climbing 61% from its low point over the following year.After interviewing Schiff in 2009, journalist and finance author Eric Tyson, referenced various Schiff predictions during the 2000s and stated that "On all of these counts, Schiff wasn't just wrong but ended up being hugely wrong." Schiff later released a video stating that, "When I gave that interview in 2002, I had no way of knowing how irresponsible the Fed was going to be ... But I recognized that early: back in 2003 and 2004 I changed my forecast ... if you look at what happened to the Dow in terms of gold [and not U.S. dollars], my forecast was extremely accurate."
In an August 2006 interview he said: "The United States economy is like the Titanic and I am here with the lifeboat trying to get people to leave the ship... I see a real financial crisis coming for the United States." On December 31, 2006 in debate on Fox News, Schiff forecast that "what's going to happen in 2007" is that "real estate prices are going to come crashing back down to Earth".
As part of these exchanges on Fox News and his repeated appearances on financial news network CNBC, Schiff had mentioned factors such as speculators and "the absence of lending standards" which are now seen by many to indeed be contributing factors to the housing crisis of 2007-2009. On December 13, 2007 in a Bloomberg interview on the show Open Exchange, Schiff further added that he felt that the crisis would extend to the credit card lending industry. Following this observation, it was soon reported on December 23, 2007 by the Associated Press that "The value of credit card accounts at least 30 days late jumped 26 percent to $17.3 billion in October from a year earlier at 17 large credit card trusts examined by the AP... At the same time, defaults -- when lenders essentially give up hope of ever being repaid and write off the debt -- rose 18 percent to almost $961 million in October, according to filings made by the trusts with the Securities and Exchange Commission."
Since 2007, Schiff has stated many times that if the government doesn't change course there will be hyperinflation in the US. Schiff is one of a minority of economists credited with accurately predicting the financial crisis of 2007–2010 while "nearly all [macroeconomists] failed to foresee the recession despite plenty of warning signs". In his book Crash Proof, he described several aspects of the U.S. economy that would lead to a recession.
Schiff's notoriety for financial predictions increased when a You Tube video entitled "Peter Schiff was right" became popular in late 2008 and 2009. The video consists of a compilation of clips of his many appearances on various financial news programs from networks including CNBC, Fox News, MSNBC and Bloomberg, most of which took place from 2005 to 2007. In the segments Schiff explains specifically the fundamental problems he saw with the United States economy at that time. Schiff's warnings of a coming economic collapse earned him the moniker "Dr. Doom."
In late 2006, Schiff predicted the housing bubble and resulting subprime mortgage crisis, and in late 2008, he predicted the automotive industry crisis and the crisis in the banking and financial markets.
Despite predictions regarding the housing bubble and automotive industry difficulties coming to fruition, as early as 2009 Schiff was receiving criticism due to the performance of some of his client's accounts in 2008, as well as controversies over the predictions themselves. In January 2009, economic blogger and investment adviser Michael Shedlock reported, "I have talked with many who claim they have invested with Schiff and are down anywhere from 40% to 70% in 2008." Other criticisms followed, including the aforementioned Eric Tyson post as well as an article for the investment news site Seeking Alpha, published on the site two days after Shedlock's blog post. Later that week an article appeared in the Wall Street Journal reporting that Schiff's broker-dealer firm, Euro Pacific Capital Inc., "advised its clients to bet that the dollar would weaken significantly and that foreign stocks would outpace their U.S. peers" and that instead, the dollar advanced against most currencies, "magnifying the losses from foreign stocks Mr. Schiff steered his investors into."
The Director of Communications at Schiff's investment firm responded to the original Shedlock piece by saying, "While it is true, that our accounts have suffered badly in 2008, a fact that we have never disputed or ran from, [Shedlock's] estimates for the size our of typical client losses are exaggerated and unfair." Schiff personally responded to Shedlock's criticism by saying, "to examine the effectiveness of my investment strategy immediately following a major correction by looking only at those accounts who adopted the strategy at the previous peak is unfair and distortive" and called Shedlock's blog entry "nothing more than an overt advertisement (and a highly deceptive one at that) to use my popularity to advance his career," adding that losses were felt mostly by recent clients and not by others.
Schiff responded similarly to criticisms made by Wade Slome of Sidoxia Capital Management, LLC. in a September 2009 blog entry entitled, "The Emperor Schiff Has No Clothes." Schiff stated not only were the losses suffered by his clients in 2008 highly exaggerated, but also that most of those losses have already been recouped, stating that many who where down then are now up, and most long-term clients were never down at all, but merely temporarily lost some of the profits they had earned over the years.
The January 2009 Wall Street Journal article discussed the value of Schiff's predictions, and stated how deficiencies "made mincemeat of investors who took his advice in 2008." In an interview the following week Schiff likened himself to billionaire investor Warren Buffett saying they were both "buy and hold" long-term investors. Contrasting his negative press he compared claims about accounts managed under Schiff's firm to the stock market value of Warren Buffett's company, saying: "His approach is you buy stocks and you never sell them—you hope to never sell them—and Berkshire Hathaway is down 40% in the last thirteen months; I don't see the Wall Street Journal saying 'Warren Buffett made mincemeat out of his clients.'" The Wall Street Journal also published a letter written by Schiff in response to his critics saying: "My central investing premise, a weakening dollar and safety in gold, commodities and foreign stocks, didn't materialize in 2008. But all the ingredients were (and remain) present for those movements to occur. Over the past year, market reactions that I didn't foresee—massive global deleveraging, a knee-jerk 'flight to quality' into U.S. Treasuries and a sharp counter trend rally in the U.S. dollar—have kept the scenario from playing out."
In a November 2009 videoblog, Schiff said that five stocks he picked for Fortune Magazine in January 2009 had gained a total of 360%.
In a March 2009 speech Schiff said that it would be impossible for the U.S. debt to China to be repaid unless the U.S. dollar's value is substantially diluted through inflation.
Schiff said that "I would not be surprised to see [gold] at $5,000 over the next several years" and that the 2009 stock market rally was a "bear market rally". In 2008 when asked about future prices of gold, Schiff stated, "I think it could be $2,000 an ounce sometime next year". This did not happen as the price of gold did not exceed $1,230 per ounce in 2009. In 2010, Schiff predicted that gold could "reach $5,000 to $10,000 in the next five to ten years".
In his 2009 book "Crash Proof 2.0," Schiff predicts that the U.S. housing crisis will continue to worsen for several years as more homeowners invariably default on their mortgages in spite of government assistance programs. The commercial real estate market will also enter into a steep decline, largely due to decreased consumer spending, leading real estate prices in both sectors to drop considerably and for foreclosures to increase.
Schiff also predicts that the U.S. dollar will experience massive depreciation relative to other currencies thanks to a variety of monetary policy factors. The dollar will become almost worthless, causing prices of imports like oil, many foods and the majority of consumer goods to skyrocket within the U.S. According to Schiff, the hyperinflation will create a situation in America comparable to what happened to Weimar Germany following WWI or Argentina during the 1999-2002 crisis. As such, Schiff encourages Americans to stock up on consumer goods (like clothing, shoes and batteries) now while they are still affordable. U.S. interest rates will also become exorbitant, making it almost impossible for people to get credit within a few years.
This will mark a major economic crash in the U.S. that will be even worse than the global recession. Along with hyperinflation and extremely tight credit, the country will be plagued with mass unemployment and increased homelessness, and government at all levels will have to cope with diminished revenues by making painful cuts to services. Schiff believes that the sudden decline in living standards could lead to civil violence and that the government might institute price controls on staple goods and even resort to confiscating private property and assets to pay public debts and placing capital controls to prevent money from being transferred out of the country. For these reasons, Schiff strongly recommends that Americans get their assets out of American markets now and instead invest overseas where the problems will not be so dire.
Schiff predicts that this economic calamity is inevitable within a few years, but that it will eventually end once the economy hits rock bottom and American consumers and the government make long overdue changes to their spending and saving habits. People will learn to make do with less, housing prices will return to affordable levels, the U.S. manufacturing and export sectors will become strong again, and incomes, living standards and national GDP will resume growth, albeit from a lower starting point than today. Unfortunately, the crisis will lead to a permanent global realignment of wealth as the U.S. dollar loses its reserve currency status and China becomes the world's most powerful economy.
Schiff was an economic adviser to Ron Paul's 2008 presidential campaign. In support of Paul's economic revitalization plan, he said: "We need a plan that stimulates savings and production, not more of the reckless borrowing and consumption that got us into this mess in the first place. Ron Paul's plan is the only one that amounts to a step in the right direction. If you want meaningful change—for the better that is—Ron Paul is the only candidate capable of delivering it."
In an interview in February 2009, Schiff's position was summarized as a nonpartisan critique of American policymakers, comparing former presidents George W. Bush to Herbert Hoover and President Barack Obama to former president Franklin D. Roosevelt, with neither of the more recent incumbents comparing favorably to the earlier ones.
Schiff supports the reduction of government economic regulation, and is concerned that President Obama's administration may increase such regulation.
Schiff says that the current economic crisis provides an opportunity to transition from borrowing and spending, to saving and producing. Schiff is critical of the U.S. government's efforts to "ease the pain" with economic stimulus packages and bailouts. According to Schiff, the U.S. government's approach of replacing "legitimate savings with a printing press" could result in hyperinflation.
In December 2008, Connecticut citizens created a website encouraging Schiff to campaign against the incumbent Senator Christopher Dodd. Approximately 5,000 people made campaign contributions using the web site. On February 21, 2009, a moneybomb raised over $20,000 for Schiff's campaign.
In a May 2009 video blog, Schiff said that he was seriously considering a run for the senate and when questioned by a Washington Post reporter, he said the chance of him entering politics was “better than 50-50".
In June 2009 Schiff commissioned a poll of likely voters which indicated that he trailed Dodd in popularity by four percentage points. On July 9, 2009, Schiff launched an exploratory committee and an official campaign website. He began accepting donations in an attempt to see if "people who really believe in freedom, liberty, sound money and the constitution are prepared to support that with an actual political contribution or to volunteer their services and work on this campaign." He received over 10,000 donations and many e-mails from around the world.
After giving some hints on The Daily Show Schiff officially announced his candidacy on September 17, 2009, during the MSNBC Morning Joe show. He is seeking the Republican nomination.
As of October 2009 Schiff had received more than 10,000 telephone calls and letters and raised over $1,960,000 (USD) in campaign contributions. Peter Schiff states, "I plan to bring my dedication and experience to the taxpayers of Connecticut. I may make mistakes in this campaign—but I will not make mistakes in representing you in the Senate. I look forward to an exciting race where I can share my vision with the people of Connecticut."
Democratic Party spokeswoman Colleen Flanagan said, "Despite his groupie-like following, Schiff actually has few qualifications to run for the Senate and has publicly admitted that he can't even remember the last time he voted". In response, Schiff said, "The fact that I haven't had experience ruining the country, that I haven't brought the banking system to its knees, that's my greatest attribute."
At the May 2010 Republican convention, Linda McMahon received the most delegate votes but not enough to prevent an August primary election. U.S. Rep. Rob Simmons, a Vietnam war veteran with two Bronze Stars, received more than the required 15 percent of the total votes necessary to force the primary.
In a video blog the following day, Schiff stated that in weeks prior to the convention, he had the 15 percent support he needed to be on a primary election ballot. According to Schiff, many delegates switched support as late as the week of the convention, due to disinformation spread by the Linda McMahon campaign, including the false notion that he was dropping out of the race. Schiff also stated that about 40 members of the McMahon campaign were present on the convention floor while votes were being cast, against convention rules, attempting to garner more support for McMahon. By the end of the first ballot and the round of vote switches, Schiff was left with only 3% of the vote, down from his high point of over 11% before the switch session occurred. Schiff stated that during that switch session, when it became clear that many delegates were switching from Schiff and Simmons to McMahon, Schiff instructed his remaining delegates to switch to Simmons "because I didn't think [McMahon] was playing fair." Schiff then collected the signatures necessary to earn a position on the August 2010 GOP primary ballot, submitting at least 400 signatures over the state requirement.

Peter Schiff correctly predicted the economic recession which turned the world upside down. Let's find out more about him in this article.
Unfortunately the situation in New Orleans is a microcosm of our nation as a whole. Although our reliance on foreign savings and production are widely known, and most economists accept the fact that a real economic disaster would ensue should foreigners discontinue such subsidies, dump their hoards of U.S. treasuries, and refuse to exchange real goods for paper dollars. However, rather than perusing policies to re-balance our economy, we simply do nothing and hope that day of reckoning never arrives. However, just as that strategy backfired in New Orleans, so, too, will it for America as a whole. 
These famous words were uttered by Peter D. Schiff, an American economic commentator, author, licensed stock broker, investment advisor and president of Euro Pacific Capital Inc. His company is a brokerage firm based in Darien, Connecticut. Schiff rose to prominence after claiming the prediction of the economic crisis of 2008, and following the publication of his book Crash Proof: How to Profit From the Coming Economic Collapse, in 2007. Schiff is the host of a live and popular Internet/shortwave radio show called Wall Street Unspun, and has also endorsed Murray Sabrin for the U.S. Senate seat in New Jersey.
Peter Schiff was born on March 23, 1963, in New Haven, Connecticut, and was raised in Manhattan and Miami. His father Irwin Schiff, was a well-known American tax protester. In 1987, Schiff graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with a degree in finance and accounting. After that, he started working for Shearson Lehman Brothers in the field of financial consulting. In 1996, Schiff started his own firm Euro Pacific Capital, after buying up a bankrupt broker-dealer in Florida, and went on to reincorporate the business in California.
In 2005, Schiff relocated to Darien, in order to find brokers and recruit them for his own firm. Presently his company Euro Pacific Capital, retains an office in Newport Beach, California, Arizona, Scottsdale, Florida, Palm Beach, Los Angeles and Manhattan. The company promotes Schiff's view of the U.S. Economy, and recommends an investment strategy which focuses heavily on non-U.S. stocks and precious metals.
Schiff correctly predicted the fall in real estate prices on Dec 31, 2006, in a debate on Fox News. He said that the real estate prices are going to come crashing back down to earth, and speculated that the absence of lending standards would be the potential cause for the housing crisis. On December 13, 2007, facing an interview on the show Open Exchange, Schiff further said that the economic crisis would extend to the credit card lending industry.
Schiff has often laid stress on the benefits one can derive from the current economic crisis. In his book Crash Proof: How to Profit From the Coming Economic Collapse, he supports his idea with relevant arguments. He also claims that a higher level of borrowing and spending cannot be accomplished without a severe economic recession, and that the American government is not providing any solution with the various stimulus packages and bailouts. In his opinion, such actions will only worsen the situation and possibly result in hyperinflation.
