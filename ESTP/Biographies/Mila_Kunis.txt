Milena Markovna "Mila" Kunis[nb 1] (/ˈmiːlə ˈkuːnɪs/; born August 14, 1983)[2] is an American actress. In 1991, at the age of seven, she moved from the Soviet Union to Los Angeles with her family. After being enrolled in acting classes as an after-school activity, she was soon discovered by an agent. She appeared in several television series and commercials, before acquiring her first significant role prior to her 15th birthday, playing Jackie Burkhart on the television series That '70s Show. In September 1999, she began voicing Meg Griffin on the animated series Family Guy.
Her breakout film role came in 2008,[3][4] playing Rachel Jansen in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Subsequent film roles included Mona Sax in Max Payne, Solara in The Book of Eli, Jamie in Friends with Benefits, Lori in the comedy Ted, and Theodora in Oz the Great and Powerful. Her performance as Lily in Black Swan gained her worldwide accolades, including receiving the Premio Marcello Mastroianni for Best Young Actor or Actress at the 67th Venice International Film Festival, and nominations for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role.
Kunis was born in Chernivtsi, in the Ukrainian SSR (now Ukraine).[5] Her mother, Elvira, is a physics teacher who runs a pharmacy, and her father, Mark Kunis, is a mechanical engineer who works as a cab driver.[6] Kunis has an elder brother named Michael (born c. 1976).[7][8] She stated in 2011 that her parents had "amazing jobs", and that the family was "very lucky" and "not poor"; they had decided to leave the USSR because they saw "no future" there for Kunis and her brother.[5] In 1991, when she was seven years old, her family moved to Los Angeles, California with $250. "That was all we were allowed to take with us. My parents had given up good jobs and degrees, which were not transferable. We arrived in New York on a Wednesday and by Friday morning my brother and I were at school in LA."[5]
Kunis comes from a Jewish family and has cited antisemitism in the former Soviet Union as one of several reasons for her family's move to the United States.[9][10][11] She has stated that her parents "raised [her] Jewish as much as they could," although religion was suppressed in the Soviet Union.[9] On her second day in Los Angeles, Kunis was enrolled at Rosewood Elementary School, not knowing a word of English. She later recalled: "I blocked out second grade completely. I have no recollection of it. I always talk to my mom and my grandma about it. It was because I cried every day. I didn't understand the culture. I didn't understand the people. I didn't understand the language. My first sentence of my essay to get into college was like, 'Imagine being blind and deaf at age seven.' And that's kind of what it felt like moving to the States."[12]
In Los Angeles, she attended Hubert Howe Bancroft Middle School.[13] She used an on-set tutor for most of her high school years while filming That '70s Show.[14] When not on the set, she attended Fairfax High School, from which she graduated in 2001.[10] She briefly attended UCLA and Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.[7][15]
At age nine, Kunis was enrolled by her father in acting classes after school at the Beverly Hills Studios, where she met Susan Curtis, who would become her manager.[16][17] On her first audition she landed the role for a Barbie commercial.[18] Shortly after, she did a commercial for the Lisa Frank product line.[19][20] Her first television roles took place in 1994, first appearing on Days of Our Lives,[21][22] and a few months later doing her first of two appearances on Baywatch.[23] She had a minor role on 7th Heaven[14] and supporting roles in Santa with Muscles, Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves, and the Angelina Jolie film Gia, as the young Gia Carangi.[7]
At the age of 10, Kunis auditioned for but failed to get the role of a Russian Jewish girl who moves to America in the film Make a Wish, Molly.[24] Instead, she was cast in the secondary role of a Mexican girl.[25] In 1998, Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhart in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show. All who auditioned were required to be at least 18 years old; Kunis, who was 14 at the time, told the casting directors she would be 18 but did not say when. Though they eventually figured it out, the producers still thought Kunis was the best fit for the role.[9][17] That '70s Show ran for eight seasons.[26] She won two consecutive Young Star Awards as Best Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series in 1999 and 2000 for her performances.[27]
In 1999, Kunis replaced Lacey Chabert in the role of Meg Griffin on the animated sitcom Family Guy,[28] created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show.[29] MacFarlane called Kunis back after her first audition, instructing her to speak slower, and then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Upon claiming that she had mastered these speech particulars, MacFarlane hired her.[29] MacFarlane added: "What Mila Kunis brought to it was in a lot of ways, I thought, almost more right for the character. I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job, but there was something about Mila – something very natural about Mila. She was 15 when she started, so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Often times with animation they'll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers and they always sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound often times very forced. She had a very natural quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work."[30] Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production in 2007.[31] She also voiced Meg in the Family Guy Video Game!. Kunis described her character as "the scapegoat."[32]
In 2001, she appeared in Get Over It opposite Kirsten Dunst. She followed that up in 2002, by starring in the straight-to-DVD horror film American Psycho 2 alongside William Shatner, a sequel to the 2000 film American Psycho. American Psycho 2 was panned by critics,[33] and later, Kunis herself expressed embarrassment over the film.[34] In 2004, Kunis starred in the film adaptation Tony n' Tina's Wedding. Although the film was shot in 2004, it did not have a theatrical release until 2007.[35] Most critics did not like the film, which mustered a 25% approval from Rotten Tomatoes.[36] DVD talk concluded that "fans would be much better off pretending the movie never happened in the first place".[37]
In 2005, Kunis co-starred with Jon Heder in Moving McAllister, which was not released theatrically until 2007.[38] The film received generally poor reviews and had a limited two-week run in theaters.[39][40] She followed up with After Sex starring alongside Zoe Saldana, who had also appeared in Get Over It.[41] In October 2006, she began filming Boot Camp (originally titled Straight Edge).[42] The film was not released in theatres in the United States, but was released on DVD on August 25, 2009.[43]
Kunis starred as Rachel Jansen in the 2008 comedy film, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, co-produced by Judd Apatow. The role, which she won after unsuccessfully auditioning for Knocked Up,[4] entailed improvisation on her part.[44] The film garnered positive reviews,[45] and was a commercial success, grossing $105 million worldwide.[46] Kunis's performance was well-received; Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal praised her "fresh beauty and focused energy",[47] while James Berardinelli wrote that she is "adept with her performance and understands the concept of comic timing".[48] She was nominated for a Teen Choice Award.[49] In an interview, Kunis credited Apatow with helping her to expand her career from That '70s Show.[4]
Also in 2008, Kunis portrayed Mona Sax, an assassin, alongside Mark Wahlberg in the action film Max Payne, based on the video game of the same name. Kunis underwent training in guns, boxing, and martial arts for her role.[50] Max Payne was relatively successful at the box office, grossing $85 million worldwide[51] but was panned by critics,[52] with several reviewers calling Kunis miscast.[53][54] Travis Estvold of Boise Weekly wrote that she was "horribly miscast as some sort of undersized, warble-voiced crime boss".[55] Director John Moore defended his choice of Kunis saying, "Mila just bowled us over..... She wasn't an obvious choice, but she just wears Mona so well. We needed someone who would not be just a fop or foil to Max; we needed somebody who had to be that character and convey her own agenda. I think Mila just knocked it out of the park."[50] She was nominated for another Teen Choice Award for her role in the film.[56]
In 2009, she appeared in the comedy film Extract with Ben Affleck and Jason Bateman. The film received mostly positive reviews,[57] and grossed $10.8 million at the box office.[58] Roger Ebert, while critical of the film itself, wrote that Kunis "brings her role to within shouting distance of credibility."[59] Director Mike Judge commented that part of what was surprising to learn about Kunis was her ability to make references to the cult animation film Rejected. Judge said: "As beautiful as Mila is, you could believe that maybe she would cross paths with you in the real world."[60] After seeing Kunis perform in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Judge wanted to cast her in the role of Cindy in Extract: "I just thought, 'Wow, this girl's perfect.' And she really wanted to do it, which was fantastic." Said Kunis, "I'm a huge fan of Mike Judge's from Office Space, so I was, like, 'Okay, this is a very easy decision.' I told them I would do anything needed to be in this production– like craft service, or, say, acting."[61]
In 2010, she starred alongside Denzel Washington in the action film The Book of Eli. Although the film received mixed reviews,[62] it performed well at the box office, grossing over $157 million worldwide.[63] Film critic Richard Roeper praised Kunis's performance, calling it a "particularly strong piece of work".[64] Several other reviews were equally positive, including that of Pete Hammond of Boxoffice magazine, who wrote that she's "ideally cast in the key female role"[65] Even reviewers who didn't necessarily like the film complimented her performance, such as James Berardinelli, who wrote that "the demands of the role prove to be within her range, which is perhaps surprising considering she has been thus far pigeonholed into more lightweight parts",[66] and Colin Covert of the Star Tribune, who wrote that she "generated a spark and brought a degree of determination to her character, developing an independent female character who's not always in need of rescuing."[67] Other critics, such as Claudia Puig of USA Today felt she was miscast, noting that "she looked as if she dropped in from a Ray-Ban commercial".[68][69][70] Kunis received another Teen Choice Award nomination for her performance.[71][72] Kunis was also cast in a minor role in the 2010 comedy film Date Night, starring Tina Fey and Steve Carell.[73] She garnered several positive reviews for her performance.[74][75][76] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune concluded her performance with James Franco helped save the film and gave it "a shot in the arm."[77]
Kunis was nominated for multiple awards, including her first Golden Globe, for the 2010 film Black Swan. She played a rival ballet dancer to the main character, played by Natalie Portman. Director Darren Aronofsky cast Kunis in the film based on her performance in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and on the recommendation of co-star and close friend Natalie Portman.[24][78] She underwent a training regimen that included cardiovascular exercise, a 1,200-calorie a day diet (she lost 20 pounds that she regained after filming ended), and ballet classes for four hours a day, seven days a week.[3][79][80] During the demanding production, she suffered injuries including a torn ligament and a dislocated shoulder.[81] Black Swan has received widespread acclaim from critics[82] and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture.[83] The film grossed over $106.9 million in the United States and Canada[84] while grossing over $329 million worldwide.[85] Reviews of Kunis's performance have been positive,[86][87][88] with Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter stating, "Kunis makes a perfect alternate to Portman, equally as lithe and dark but a smirk of self-assurance in place of Portman's wide-eyed fearfulness."[89] Guy Lodge of In Contention also praised Kunis, saying, "it's the cool, throaty-voiced Kunis who is the surprise package here, intelligently watching and reflecting her co-star in such a manner that we're as uncertain as Nina of her ingenuousness."[90] Kunis's performance won her the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Young Actor or Actress at the 67th Venice International Film Festival,[91] and earned her Golden Globe Award[92] and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress.[93] At the 37th annual Saturn Awards, she was also honored with the Best Supporting Actress award for her performance.[94]
Kunis was cast alongside Justin Timberlake in the romantic comedy Friends with Benefits.[95] Director Will Gluck stated that he wrote the story with Kunis and Timberlake in mind.[96] Friends with Benefits achieved success at the box office, grossing over $149 million worldwide,[97] and received mostly positive reviews with critics praising the chemistry between Kunis and Timberlake.[98] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that "Ms. Kunis is fast proving that she's a gift that keeps giving to mainstream romantic comedy" and "her energy is so invigorating and expansive and her presence so vibrant that she fills the screen".[99]
In 2012, Kunis co-starred with Mark Wahlberg in Ted, her most commercially successful film to date. The film was directed and co-written by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane. Kunis played the girlfriend of Wahlberg's character. When MacFarlane first conceived the project, he considered Kunis too young for the role. However, the film remained in development for several years and when it was finally ready to begin production, he ended up casting her.[100] Ted has received generally positive reviews from critics[101] and was a commercial success, grossing $549 million worldwide.[102] Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that Kunis "brings some lovely subtle grace notes to a role that easily could have just been 'the pushy girlfriend'".[103]
In 2013, Kunis played Theodora, the youngest of three witches, opposite James Franco, in the Walt Disney Pictures' prequel, Oz the Great and Powerful.[104][105] She dedicated her performance in the film to Margaret Hamilton, the original Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939 film.[106] The film, and Kunis's performance, received mixed reviews from critics.[107] Kim Newman of Empire Magazine wrote that Kunis "walks away with the honours as the wavering witch Theodora, whose heartbreak brings another, less-expected depth to this 3D spectacle".[108] In contrast, Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter found Kunis's performance to be uncertain as her character seemed to be in a state of limbo.[109] Oz the Great and Powerful was a commercial success, grossing over $493 million worldwide.[110]
Also in 2013 Kunis co-starred in the crime thriller Blood Ties with Clive Owen, Billy Crudup, and Marion Cotillard.[111] The film premiered at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and had a limited release in the United States in 2014.[112] Blood Ties received mixed reviews.[113] Kunis was also cast in the comedy The Angriest Man in Brooklyn, alongside Robin Williams and Peter Dinklage.[114] The film had a limited theatrical and VOD release [115] and received poor reviews.[116] Kunis will next be seen in the Paul Haggis-directed film Third Person co-starring with Liam Neeson, Olivia Wilde and James Franco.[117]
Kunis will be co-starring with Channing Tatum in the sci-fi film, Jupiter Ascending. Directed by the Wachowskis the film was originally scheduled to be released on July 18, 2014[118] but on June 3, 2014, the film's release was delayed until February 6, 2015.[119]
Kunis is set to be an executive producer for a feminist-themed TV series for the The CW network. Meridian Hills, is a drama about the women's liberation movement in the 1970s. She will not appear on-screen.[120][121][122]
In 2007, Kunis participated in a video for the website Funny or Die appearing alongside James Franco. The video was a parody of the MTV show The Hills and was a huge success for the website, with well over one million views.[123] Shawn Levy, director of Date Night, stated that part of what made him decide to cast Kunis with James Franco in the film was the chemistry he felt they had in the Funny or Die video.[124] In December 2008, Kunis was featured in Gap's "Shine Your Own Star" Christmas campaign.[125]
In 2010, she was featured in the "Women We Love" segment in Esquire with an accompanied video.[126] Kunis was among several female stars photographed by Canadian singer/songwriter Bryan Adams in conjunction with the Calvin Klein Collections for a feature titled American Women 2010, with the proceeds from the photographs donated to the NYC AIDS foundation.[127] During the summer of 2010 Kunis served with Randy Jackson as the Master of Ceremonies for the 9th Annual Chrysalis Foundation Benefit. The Chrysalis Foundation is a Los Angeles-based non-profit organization formed to help economically disadvantaged and homeless individuals to become self-sufficient through employment opportunities.[128]
GQ magazine named Kunis the Knockout of the Year for 2011,[129] with Men's Health naming her one of the "100 Hottest Women of All-Time".[130] FHM magazine ranked her number 9 on its 2012 Hot 100 list,[131] but she reached number 1 on their 2013 "100 Sexiest Women in the World" list,[132][133] which brings to an end a four-year run by British women.[134]
Prior to this in 2008 Kunis stated, "You've got to base your career on something other than being FHM's top 100 number one girl. Your looks are going to die out, and then what's going to be left?"[12] Maxim has consistently ranked Kunis on its Hot 100 list, reaching a ranking of number 5 in both 2009 and 2011[135] and number 3 in 2012.[136][137] Esquire magazine named her 2012's Sexiest Woman Alive.[138] She ranked #2 on AskMen's list of Top 99 Women for 2013, behind only Jennifer Lawrence.[139] In 2013, she responded to those lists: "All I can say is, I feel honored to be considered sexy."[140]
Christian Dior signed Kunis in 2012 to be the face of its Spring fashion campaign.[141][142] In February 2013, she was named Gemfields global brand ambassador and the face of their advertising campaign.[143] Gemfields is a luxury company that produces emeralds, rubies, and amethysts. She visited Gemfields' mine in Zambia.[144]
In 2013, she appeared in Forbes list of 100 powerful celebrities, ranking #89 on the basis of five criteria (Money, TV/Radio, Press, Social, and Marketability), with her highest ranking as #14 in marketability. She earned $11 million for the year ending in June 2013.[145]
In 2014, Kunis is slated to appear in a range of global advertising for Beam, Inc. (makers of Jim Beam bourbon).[146]
Although Kunis has described herself as a "computer nerd", she does not have a Myspace, Facebook or Twitter account.[147] Kunis discussed her desire for privacy: "Why would I want to share my life with the world when it's being shared already, without my consent? The only problem with not having an account is that there are fake accounts, pretending to quote me. But what am I going to tweet about?"[148]
On September 14, 2011, the FBI announced it was investigating the alleged hacking of Kunis's cellphone and email accounts, along with those of other celebrities.[149][150][151] Christopher Chaney from Jacksonville, Florida, pleaded guilty in federal court to nine counts of computer hacking.[152]
In November 2011, Kunis was escorted by Sgt. Scott Moore to a United States Marine Corps Ball in Greenville, North Carolina. Kunis had accepted Moore's invitation in July after he posted it as a YouTube video while serving with the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, in Afghanistan's Helmand province. The event celebrated the Marine Corps' 236th anniversary.[153]
Kunis supports the Democratic Party and Barack Obama.[154] In a 2012 interview, she criticized the Republican Party, saying: "The way that Republicans attack women is so offensive to me. And the way they talk about religion is offensive. I may not be a practicing Jew, but why we gotta talk about Jesus all the time?"[138]
In January 2011, she revealed her struggle with an eye condition called chronic iritis that had caused blindness in one eye. However, a couple of months earlier she had surgery that corrected the problem.[155] Kunis also has the condition heterochromia iridum, where the irises have different colors. One eye (left) is brown, and the other (right) is green.[132][156]
Kunis began dating actor Macaulay Culkin in 2002.[157][158] During their relationship, there were rumors of the couple getting married, but Kunis denied them.[159] In an interview with BlackBook magazine, Kunis stated that marriage is "not something that's important to me".[160] Kunis said she tried her best to protect her and Culkin's privacy, noting that "We don't talk about it to the press. It's already more high profile than I want it to be."[161] When asked if it was difficult to stay out of the tabloids and press, Kunis responded: "I keep my personal life as personal as I physically, mentally, possibly can." Asked if that is difficult she said, "I don't care. I will go to my grave trying. It is hard, but I'll end up going to a bar that's a hole in the wall. I won't go to the 'it's-happening' place."[162] On January 3, 2011, Kunis's publicist confirmed reports that Kunis and Culkin had ended their relationship, saying "The split was amicable, and they remain close friends."[157]
Kunis started dating her former That '70s Show co-star Ashton Kutcher in April 2012,[163] though they did not confirm the relationship until March 2013.[164] In February 2014, it was announced that the couple became engaged.[165] In May 2014, Kunis confirmed to Ellen DeGeneres that she and Kutcher were engaged and expecting their first child together.[166]

      [on her That '70s Show (1998) character, Jackie Burkhart, switching boyfriends from Michael Kelso to Steven Hyde]: I think her relationship with Steven has taught her to be less selfish.
      [Denying false reports of marriage]: I've been engaged, I think I've already been married, And I'm sure I have a child somewhere. I'm waiting to have something else happen. No, I'm not married. And, no, I'm not engaged. And, no, I do not have a child. No one seems to listen. And next week I'll be engaged again. I think, at one point, they were like, "Seen shopping in Beverly Hills for engagement rings." We were in Japan working. What is wrong with these people? Half the time you can say they misconstrued facts. But, more often than not, they just make stuff up.
      Well, I was born and grew up in Russia. I wasn't allowed to be religious. My whole family was in the Holocaust. My grandparents passed [away] and not many survived. After the Holocaust in Russia, you were not allowed to be religious. So my parents raised me to know I was Jewish. You know who you are inside. You don't need to tell the whole world. You believe what you believe, and that's what's important. And that's how I was raised. My family was like, "You are Jewish in your blood." We can celebrate Yom Kippur and Hannukah in Russia--but not by the book. We do it to our own extent because being in Russia... Bar Mitzvahs weren't held. When I was in school over there, up until I was seven, you would still see anti-Semitic signs. One of my friends who grew up in Russia... she was in second grade... and she came home one day crying. Her mother asked why she was crying and she said on the back of her seat there was a swastika. Now this is a country that obviously does not want you. So my parents raised me Jewish as much as they could and they came to America. I love my religion. I think it's a beautiful religion, but I took parts of it that I want for myself. I don't need to go to temple. I will, but I don't need to.
      I never dated Wilmer Valderrama. I never dated Danny Masterson. They're like my brothers. That's disgusting. That's wrong.
      I started acting when I was nine as a hobby because it was fun and I could get out of school. I didn't ever think that I would have it as a job because I didn't know you could have a job in acting. But now I really love what I do and I can't even imagine doing anything else.
      No strings sex is great in theory but falls short in execution. You can't sustain a friends with benefits relationship for a long time. It's inevitable it will either go one way or the other. I have plenty of males who are my friends... Without the benefits. If you're friends with someone, let's just leave it at that. There needs to be nothing more.
      I think than an actor is more likely to be forgiven in the public's eye than an actress. There will always be a double standard between males and females, so I think that an actress is more likely to protect her public persona, so to speak, than an actor would be. An actor goes crazy in a hotel room, gets trashed, throws a bench, breaks a window, and he is considered a rock star. An actress does that and she's sent to rehab and is thought to have problems and issues and can't get a job.
      [on Oz the Great and Powerful (2013)] This is the first film that I've ever done that kids are allowed to see.
      You have to laugh at the absurdity of this entire industry and the absurdity of what it is we do. If I didn't, I'd go crazy.
      Over the course of That '70s Show (1998), you can see me go through puberty, and who wants to watch that? No one should have that part of their life on record.
      I've always been a big proponent of not working for the sake of working because I don't want to work for the rest of my life; I want to live.
      There are two people out there, Star Trek fans and Star Wars fans... I'm a Star Trek fan. I respect Star Wars, I'm a bit of a Sci-Fi nerd but, geared towards one or the other, I'd choose Star Trek.

Soon the photogenic newcomer appears in ads and TV commercials for Barbie, Lisa Frank products and Payless shoes.1998August 23Time TravelAt 14, Kunis stars as snobby Jackie Burkhart in That '70s Show, with Ashton Kutcher, Topher Grace, Danny Masterson and Laura Prepon.

A petite actress with olive skin and pixie features, Ukrainian-born Mila Kunis became a breakout teen star on the FOX sitcom That '70s Show, playing spoiled daddy's girl Jackie Burkhardt. The rare 15-year-old actress to be cast as a 15-year-old character, Kunis also demonstrated her maturity by mastering accent-free English only a few years after immigrating. Her command of slang and teen vocal mannerisms won her work even when her appearance was not being utilized, as she voiced another all-American teen on FOX's animated envelope-pusher, Family Guy. Milena Markovna Kunis was born on August 14, 1983 in Kiev, Ukraine, then moved with her parents to Los Angeles when she was seven years old. Kunis credits listening to the simple vocabulary of Bob Barker on The Price Is Right with helping her develop a speedy fluency in English. She enrolled in acting classes at the Beverly Hills Studio, where she was discovered performing in a showcase. She quickly began appearing in commercials. Kunis filled out her early resumé with such pit stops as Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves (1997), Krippendorf's Tribe (1998), and the infamous WB ratings cellar-dweller Nick Freno: Licensed Teacher (1996).  She also played a younger version of Angelina Jolie in the HBO movie Gia (1998). But it was her casting in Mark Brazill's That '70s Show that earned Kunis notice, as her petulant teen queen soon became a standout, able to range from endearing to grating. Her aggravated whining rung true enough to earn her a voice-over role on Family Guy, taking over for Lacey Chabert as Megan Griffin during the 2000 season. As the 2000's roled along, however, Kunis would seem to graduate to the ranks of adult actresses, rather than teen starlets, in seemingly the blink of an eye. Her comic turn in 2008's massively successful comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall kicked off Kunis' new style, followed quickly by roles as a femme fatale in 2008's Max Payne, a seductive grifter in 2009's Extract, and a post apocalyptic heroine in 2010's Book of Eli. 2010 would also find her playing opposite Natalie Portman's Oscar winning performance in Darren Aronofsky's psychological thriller The Black Swan. Though her supporting role offered less opportunity to showcase her talents than her costar's did, Kunis was roundly praised for the skill and presence she brought to the production -- not to mention her commitment to transforming her body for her character, training for months in ballet -- all further cementing her reputation as a serious actress.  Kunis would spend the next several years appearing in numerous projects, like Friends with Benefits, The Muppets, Ted and Oz the Great and Powerful. ~ Derek Armstrong, Rovi

Height: 5'4" Hometown: Chernivtsi, Ukraine In a Relationship With:Ashton Kutcher Best Quotes:“Blondes definitely do not have more fun. Trust me”“I think everyone has a little black swan in them, it's just a matter of when you let it out.” 
Mila Kunis (born Milena “Mila” Kunis in Chernivtsi, Ukrainian SSR on August 14, 1983) is an American actress. Mila moved from Chernivtsi to Los Angeles when she was seven years old. She quickly began acting classes, which she enjoyed immensely, and was subsequently discovered by an agent. She chalked up several small roles in commercials and TV shows, before landing her first big role as Jackie Burkhart on That 70′s Show. However, her major breakout role was playing Rachel Jansen in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Other movies she has starred in include The Book of Eli, Friends with Benefits, Black Swan, and Ted. She has appeared on many magazine covers including Cosmopolitian, Harper’s Bazaar, and GQ Magazine.
Mila Kunis dated child-star Macaulay Culkin from 2002 until 2011. After their breakup, she moved on to a relationship with her former That ’70s Show co-star, Ashton Kutcher. Rumors that the two were dating began picking up steam in April 2012, though Ashton didn’t confirm the relationship until March 2013.

Mila Kunis got her start on That 70s Show, but it seems like decades since the hot, young actress has been in bellbottoms. Check out what Mila’s been up to!
Did you know that Mila had to lie about her age to nab the role of Jackie Burkhart? The producers of That 70s Show were looking for an 18 year old actress, but Mila was only 14! Nevertheless, her charm and sneaky answer (Mila said she’d be 18 “on her birthday,” but she didn’t say which birthday!) had cemented her in the role of Jackie.
Mila may be known for her sexy, flirty performances, but she jumped at the chance to voice the awkward Meg Griffin in Family Guy. Mila said she found it fun voicing a character who was “just in a perpetual mode of humiliation.”
Mila made the jump from the small screen to film early in her career. She acted in terrible movies like Piranha, Santa With Muscles and American Psycho 2 before making a name for herself as Rachel Jansen in the 2008 movie, Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Rachel is a fun-loving Hawaiian who comforts the heartbroken Peter while he’s on vacation. Mila loved shooting on location in Hawaii. “I want to go back to Hawaii,” she said. “I want to kind of transport everybody that I love in L.A. to Hawaii and live there!” 
One of the people she loves is her long-term boyfriend, Macaulay Culkin. You might know Macaulay as the child-actor who played Kevin in the Home Alone movies! Macaulay is all grown up now and he lives with Mila in California.
So what’s next for Mila? She’s starring in two movies in 2010—Date Night and Black Swan. Date Night is a comedy starring Tina Fey and Steve Carell. Black Swan is a more serious movie. Mila plays Lily, a ballerina whose rival is played by Natalie Portman. 2010 looks like it’ll be a big year for Mila!
