Madonna Louise Ciccone[2] (/tʃɪˈkoʊneɪ/) (born August 16, 1958) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and businesswoman. One of the most prominent cultural icons for over three decades, she has achieved an unprecedented level of power and control for a woman in the entertainment industry. She attained immense popularity by pushing the boundaries of lyrical content in mainstream popular music and imagery in her music videos, which became a fixture on MTV. Madonna is known for continuously reinventing both her music and image, and for retaining a standard of autonomy within the recording industry. Music critics have praised her diverse and innovative musical productions which have also been known to induce controversy. Cited as an influence among numerous artists around the world, she is often referred to as the "Queen of Pop".
Born in Bay City, Michigan, Madonna moved to New York City to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing in the music groups Breakfast Club and Emmy, she signed with Sire Records (an affiliate of Warner Bros. Records) in 1982 and released her self-titled debut album the following year. She followed it with a series of commercially successful albums, including the Grammy Award winners Ray of Light (1998) and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005). Throughout her career, she has written and produced most of her songs, with many of them having hit number one on the record charts, including "Like a Virgin", "Into the Groove", "Papa Don't Preach", "Like a Prayer", "Vogue", "Frozen", "Music", "Hung Up", and "4 Minutes".
Madonna's popularity was further enhanced by her critically successful role in film Desperately Seeking Susan (1985). However, most of her film appearances received harsh feedback. She garnered critical acclaim and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for Evita (1996). Her other ventures include: fashion design, writing children's books, and film directing and producing. She has been acclaimed as a businesswoman, most notably after she founded entertainment company Maverick (including the label Maverick Records) in 1992 as a joint venture with Time Warner. In 2007, she signed an unprecedented US $120 million 360 deal with Live Nation.
Madonna has sold more than 300 million records worldwide and is recognized as the best-selling female recording artist of all time by Guinness World Records. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she is the best-selling female rock artist of the 20th century and the second best-selling female artist in the United States, with 64.5 million certified albums. Billboard ranked her at number two, behind only The Beatles, on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, making her the most successful solo artist in the history of American singles chart. The magazine also declared her as the top-touring female artist of all time. Madonna topped the VH1's list of "100 Greatest Women in Music" and was selected among the "25 Most Powerful Women of the Past Century" by Time. She became one of the five founding members of the UK Music Hall of Fame and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in her first year of eligibility.
Madonna Louise Ciccone was born in Bay City, Michigan, on August 16, 1958. She is the eldest daughter of Silvio Anthony "Tony" Ciccone and Madonna Louise Fortin (c. 1933 – December 1, 1963).[3] Her father is the son of immigrants from Pacentro, Italy, while her mother was of French descent.[4] Tony worked as an engineer designer for Chrysler and General Motors. Since Madonna had the same name as her mother, family members called her "Little Nonni". She has two elder brothers, Anthony (born 1956) and Martin (born 1957), and three younger siblings, Paula (born 1959), Christopher (born 1960), and Melanie (born 1962).[5]
Madonna and her family are Catholic. Upon receiving confirmation in 1966, she adopted Veronica as an additional confirmation name.[6] She was raised in the Detroit suburbs of Pontiac and Avon Township (now part of Rochester Hills). Months before her mother died from breast cancer, Madonna noticed changes in her behavior and personality, although she did not understand the reason.[3] Her mother was at a loss to explain her medical condition, and often began to cry when Madonna questioned her about it. Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying.[7]
Madonna turned to her paternal grandmother in the hope of finding some solace and some form of her mother in her. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and invariably rebelled against anyone brought into their home ostensibly to take the place of their beloved mother. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Madonna commented that she saw herself in her youth as a "lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades..... I wanted to be somebody." Terrified that Tony could be taken from her as well, Madonna could often not sleep unless she was near him.[3]
In 1966, Tony married the family's housekeeper Joan Gustafson, and they had two children: Jennifer (born 1967) and Mario (born 1968).[5] At this point, Madonna started to resent him for decades, and developed a rebellious attitude.[3] She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic Elementary Schools, and then West Middle School. She was known for her high grade point average, and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, dangle by her knees from the monkey bars during recess, and pull up her skirt during class—all so that the boys could see her underwear.[8]
Madonna later attended Rochester Adams High School where she became a straight-A student and a member of the cheerleading squad.[9] After graduating, she received a dance scholarship to the University of Michigan.[10] She convinced her father to allow her to take ballet lessons[11] and was persuaded by Christopher Flynn, her ballet teacher, to pursue a career in dance.[12] In 1978, she dropped out of college and relocated to New York City.[13] She had little money and worked as a waitress at Dunkin' Donuts and with modern dance troupes.[14] Madonna said of her move to New York, "It was the first time I'd ever taken a plane, the first time I'd ever gotten a taxi cab. I came here with $35 in my pocket. It was the bravest thing I'd ever done."[15] She started to work as a backup dancer for other established artists. During a late night, Madonna was returning from a rehearsal, when a pair of men held her at knifepoint and forced her to perform fellatio. Madonna later commented that "the episode was a taste of my weakness, it showed me that I still could not save myself in spite of all the strong-girl show. I could never forget it."[16]
While performing as a backup singer and dancer for the French disco artist Patrick Hernandez on his 1979 world tour, Madonna became romantically involved with musician Dan Gilroy.[8][17] Together, they formed her first rock band, the Breakfast Club,[18] for which Madonna sang and played drums and guitar. In 1980[5] or 1981[19] she left Breakfast Club and, with her former boyfriend Stephen Bray as drummer, formed the band Emmy. The two began writing songs together and Madonna later decide to market herself as a solo act.[20] Their music impressed DJ and record producer Mark Kamins who arranged a meeting between Madonna and Sire Records founder Seymour Stein.[19]
After Madonna signed a singles deal with Sire, her debut single, "Everybody", was released in October 1982, and the second one, "Burning Up", in March 1983. Both became big club hits in the United States, reaching number three on Hot Dance Club Songs chart compiled by Billboard magazine.[21] After this success, she started developing her debut album, Madonna, which was primarily produced by Reggie Lucas, a Warner Bros. producer.[22] However, she was not happy with the completed tracks and disagreed with Lucas' production techniques, so decided to seek additional help. Madonna moved in with boyfriend John "Jellybean" Benitez, asking his help for finishing the album's production.[22] Benitez remixed most of the tracks and produced "Holiday", which was her third single and her first global hit. The overall sound of Madonna was dissonant and in the form of upbeat synthetic disco, utilizing some of the new technology of the time, like the Linn drum machine, Moog bass and the OB-X synthesizer.[22][23] The album was released in July 1983 and peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200 six months later, in 1984. It yielded two more hit singles, "Borderline" and "Lucky Star".[24][25]
"I was surprised by how people reacted to "Like a Virgin" because when I did that song, to me, I was singing about how something made me feel a certain way—brand-new and fresh—and everyone interpreted it as 'I don't want to be a virgin anymore. Fuck my brains out!' That's not what I sang at all. 'Like a Virgin' was always absolutely ambiguous."
Madonna's look and style of dressing, her performances, and her music videos influenced young girls and women and her style became one of the female fashion trends of the 1980s. It was created by stylist and jewelry designer Maripol and the look consisted of lace tops, skirts over capri pants, fishnet stockings, jewelry bearing the crucifix, bracelets, and bleached hair.[28][29] Madonna achieved global recognition after the release of her second studio album, Like a Virgin, in November 1984. It topped the charts in several countries and became her first number one album on the Billboard 200.[24][30] The title track, "Like a Virgin", topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six consecutive weeks.[31] It attracted the attention of organizations who complained that the song and its accompanying video promoted premarital sex and undermined family values,[32] and moralists sought to have the song and video banned.[33]
Madonna came under further fire when she performed "Like a Virgin" at the first 1984 MTV Video Music Awards (VMA) where she appeared on stage atop a giant wedding cake, wearing a wedding dress and white gloves. The performance is noted by MTV as an iconic moment in VMA history.[34] In later years, Madonna commented that she was actually terrified of the performance. The next hit was "Material Girl" promoted by the iconic video, which was a mimicry of Marilyn Monroe's performance of the song "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" from the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. While filming this video Madonna started dating actor Sean Penn and married him on her birthday in 1985.[35] Like a Virgin was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America and sold more than 21 million copies worldwide.[36]
Madonna entered mainstream films in February 1985, beginning with a brief appearance as a club singer in Vision Quest, a romantic drama film. Its soundtrack contained two new singles, her U.S. number-one single, "Crazy for You" and "Gambler".[37] She also appeared in the comedy Desperately Seeking Susan in March 1985, a film which introduced the song "Into the Groove", her first number one single in the United Kingdom.[38] Although not the lead actress for the film, her profile was such that the movie widely became seen (and marketed) as a Madonna vehicle.[39] The New York Times film critic Vincent Canby named it one of the ten best films of 1985.[40] In February 1984, according to the film director Sir Richard Attenborough, Madonna auditioned at the Royale Theatre on Broadway for a dance role in his movie version of A Chorus Line using her birth-name of Ciccone, but he rejected her.[41]
Beginning in April 1985, Madonna embarked on her first concert tour in North America, The Virgin Tour, with the Beastie Boys as her opening act. She progressed from playing CBGB and the Mudd Club to playing sporting arenas. At that time she released two more hit singles from the album, "Angel" and "Dress You Up".[42] In July, Penthouse and Playboy magazines published a number of nude photos of Madonna, taken in New York in 1978. She had posed for the photographs as she needed money at the time, and was paid as little as $25 a session.[43] The publication of the photos caused a media uproar, but Madonna remained defiant and unapologetic."[44] The photographs were ultimately sold for up to $100,000.[43] She referred to the whole experience at the 1985 outdoor Live Aid charity concert saying that she would not take her jacket off because "[the media] might hold it against me ten years from now."[44][45]
In June 1986, Madonna released her third studio album, True Blue, which was inspired by and dedicated to Sean Penn.[46] Rolling Stone magazine was generally impressed with the effort, writing that the album "sound[s] as if it comes from the heart".[47] It spawned three number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100: "Live to Tell", "Papa Don't Preach" and "Open Your Heart", and two more top-five singles: "True Blue" and "La Isla Bonita".[25][37] The album topped the charts in over 28 countries worldwide, an unprecedented achievement at the time and became her best-selling studio album of her career to this date with sales of 25 million.[48] In the same year, Madonna also starred in the critically panned film Shanghai Surprise for which she was awarded the Golden Raspberry Award for "worst actress". She also made her theatrical debut in a production of David Rabe's Goose and Tom-Tom, both co-starring Penn.[49] The next year, Madonna's second feature film, Who's That Girl, was released. She contributed four songs to its soundtrack, including the title track and "Causing a Commotion".[25]
Madonna embarked on the Who's That Girl World Tour in July 1987, which continued until September.[50] The tour was inspired by Madonna's belief that, with the help of people, she could turn herself into something else.[51] It broke several attendance records, including over 130,000 audience in a concert in Paris, which remains her biggest concert attendance ever.[52] Later that year, she released a remix album of past hits, titled You Can Dance, which reached number 14 on the Billboard 200.[24][53] After an annulment in December 1987, Madonna filed for divorce from Penn in January 1989 citing irreconcilable differences.[35]
"In Like a Prayer I've been dealing with more specific issues that mean a lot to me. They're about an assimilation of experiences I've had in my life and in relationships. They're about my mother, my father and my bonds with my family about the pain of dying, or growing up and letting go. [The album] was a real coming-of-age record for me emotionally..... I had to do a lot of soul-searching and I think it is a reflection of that."
In January 1989, Madonna signed an endorsement deal with soft-drink manufacturer, Pepsi. In one of her Pepsi commercials, she debuted her song "Like a Prayer". The corresponding music video featured many Catholic symbols such as stigmata and cross burning, and a dream about making love to a saint, leading the Vatican to condemn the video. Religious groups sought to ban the commercial and boycott Pepsi products. Pepsi revoked the commercial and canceled her sponsorship contract.[56][57] The song was included on Madonna's fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, which was co-written and co-produced by Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray.[58] Rolling Stone wrote that it was "as close to art as pop music gets".[59] Like a Prayer peaked at number one on the Billboard 200 and sold 15 million copies worldwide, with 4 million copies sold in the U.S. alone.[24][60] Six singles were released from the album, including "Like a Prayer", which reached number one, and "Express Yourself" and "Cherish", both peaking at number two.[25][37] By the end of the 1980s, Madonna was named as the "Artist of the Decade" by MTV, Billboard and Musician magazine.[61][62][63]
Madonna starred as Breathless Mahoney in the film Dick Tracy (1990), with Warren Beatty playing the title role.[64] Her performance led to a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actress.[65] To accompany the film, she released the soundtrack album, I'm Breathless, which included songs inspired by the film's 1930s setting. It also featured the U.S. number-one hit, "Vogue",[66] and "Sooner or Later", which earned songwriter Stephen Sondheim an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1991.[67] While shooting the film, Madonna began a relationship with Beatty which dissolved by the end of 1990.[68][69]
In April 1990, Madonna began her Blond Ambition World Tour, which was held until August.[70] Rolling Stone called it an "elaborately choreographed, sexually provocative extravaganza" and proclaimed it "the best tour of 1990".[71] The tour was met with strong reaction from religious groups for her performance of "Like a Virgin", during which two male dancers caressed her body before she simulated masturbation.[50] The Church of England and the Catholic Church criticized her performance and the Pope asked the general public and the Christian community not to attend the concert.[72] A private association of Catholics calling themselves Famiglia Domani also boycotted the tour for its eroticism.[73] In response, Madonna said, "The tour in no way hurts anybody's sentiments. It's for open minds and gets them to see sexuality in a different way. Their own and others".[74] The Laserdisc release of the tour won Madonna a Grammy Award in 1992 for Best Long Form Music Video.[75]
The Immaculate Collection, Madonna's first greatest-hits compilation album, was released in November 1990. It included two new songs, "Justify My Love" and "Rescue Me".[76] The album was certified diamond by RIAA and sold over 30 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling compilation album by a solo artist in history.[77][78] "Justify My Love" reached number one in the U.S. and top ten worldwide.[37][79] Its music video featured scenes of sadomasochism, bondage, same-sex kissing, and brief nudity.[80][81] The video was deemed too sexually explicit for MTV and was banned from the network.[80] Madonna responded to the banning: "Why is it that people are willing to go and watch a movie about someone getting blown to bits for no reason at all, and nobody wants to see two girls kissing and two men snuggling?"[82] The second single, "Rescue Me", became the highest-debuting single by a female artist in Hot 100 chart history at that time, entering at number 15 and peaking at number nine.[76]
In December 1990, Madonna decided to leave Jennifer Lynch's film, Boxing Helena, which she had previously agreed to star in, without any explanation to the producers.[83] Around this time, Madonna had an eight-month relationship with rapper Vanilla Ice; he ended their relationship because of Madonna's Sex book.[84] Her first documentary film Truth or Dare (known as In Bed with Madonna outside North America)[85] was released in mid-1991. The documentary chronicled her Blond Ambition World Tour.[19]
In 1992, Madonna had a role in A League of Their Own as Mae Mordabito, a baseball player on an all-women's team. She recorded the film's theme song, "This Used to Be My Playground", which became a Hot 100 number one hit.[37] The same year, she founded her own entertainment company, Maverick, consisting of a record company (Maverick Records), a film production company (Maverick Films), and associated music publishing, television broadcasting, book publishing and merchandising divisions. The deal was a joint venture with Time Warner and paid Madonna an advance of $60 million. It gave her 20% royalties from the music proceedings, one of the highest rates in the industry, equaled at that time only by Michael Jackson's royalty rate established a year earlier with Sony.[86] The first release from the venture was Madonna's book, titled Sex. It consisted of sexually provocative and explicit images, photographed by Steven Meisel. The book caused strong negative reaction from the media and the general public, but sold 1.5 million copies at $50 each in a matter of days.[87][88] At the same time she released her fifth studio album, Erotica, which debuted at number two on the Billboard 200.[24][88] Its title track peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100.[37] Erotica also produced five further singles: "Deeper and Deeper", "Bad Girl", "Fever", "Rain" and "Bye Bye Baby".[89] The provocative imagery continued in the 1990s with the erotic thriller, Body of Evidence, a film which contained scenes of sadomasochism and bondage. It was poorly received by critics.[90][91] She also starred in the film Dangerous Game, which was released straight to video in North America. The New York Times described the film as "angry and painful, and the pain feels real."[92]
In September 1993, Madonna embarked on The Girlie Show World Tour, in which she dressed as a whip-cracking dominatrix surrounded by topless dancers. The show faced negative reaction, specifically in Puerto Rico where she rubbed the island's flag between her legs on stage.[50] In March 1994, she appeared as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman, using profanity that was required to be censored on television and handing Letterman a pair of her underwear and asking him to smell it.[93] The releases of her sexually explicit films, albums and book, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman all made critics question Madonna as a sexual renegade. She faced strong negative publicity from critics and fans, who commented that "she had gone too far" and that her career was over.[94]
Biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli describer her ballad "I'll Remember" (1994) as an attempt to tone down her provocative image. The song was recorded for Alek Keshishian's film With Honors.[95] She made a subdued appearance with Letterman at an awards show and appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno after realizing that she needed to change her musical direction in order to sustain her popularity.[96] With her sixth studio album, Bedtime Stories (1994), Madonna employed a softer image to try to improve the public perception of her.[96] The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and produced four singles, including "Secret" and "Take a Bow", the latter topping the Hot 100 for seven weeks, the longest period of any Madonna single.[97] At the same time, she became romantically involved with fitness trainer Carlos Leon.[98] Something to Remember, a collection of ballads, was released in November 1995. The album featured three new songs: "You'll See", "One More Chance", and a cover of Marvin Gaye's "I Want You".[37][99]
1996 saw the release of Evita, in which Madonna played the title role of Eva Perón.[100][101] For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Perón and even wrote to director Alan Parker, explaining how she would be perfect for the part. She stated, "This is the role I was born to play. I put everything of me into this because it was much more than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time..... And I am prouder of Evita than anything else I have done."[102] After securing it, she underwent vocal training and learned about the history of Argentina and Perón. During shooting she fell sick many times due to the intense emotional effort required.[103] However, as she told Oprah, she was also pregnant during the filming, which was also a factor: "I was winded after every take. I had to lie on the couch every ten minutes so I could recover from dizzy spells, I was worried that I was shaking the baby around too much and that would injure it in some way."[104] Nevertheless, Madonna managed to find a positive side to those problems, which she wrote in her personal diary at the time: "Ironically, this feeling of vulnerability and weakness is helping me in the movie. I’m sure Evita felt this way every day of her life once she discovered she was ill."[105]
After its release, Evita garnered critical appreciation. Zach Conner from Time magazine commented "It's a relief to say that Evita is pretty damn fine, well cast and handsomely visualized. Madonna once again confounds our expectations. She plays Evita with a poignant weariness and has more than just a bit of star quality. Love or hate Madonna-Eva, she is a magnet for all eyes."[106][107] Madonna won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for the role.[108] She released three singles from the Evita soundtrack album including "You Must Love Me" (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1997) and "Don't Cry for Me Argentina".[109] Madonna was later presented with the Artist Achievement Award by Tony Bennett at the 1996 Billboard Music Awards.[110] On October 14, 1996, Madonna gave birth to Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon, her daughter with Leon.[111] Biographer Mary Cross writes that although Madonna was often ill during the filming and worried that her pregnancy would harm the film, she reached some important personal goals: "Now 38 years old, Madonna had at last triumphed on screen and achieved her dream of having a child, both in the same year. She had reached another turning point in her career, reinventing herself and her image with the public."[112]
Madonna's relationship with Carlos Leon ended in May 1997;[113] she declared that they were "better off as best friends."[114] After Lourdes' birth, Madonna became involved in Eastern mysticism and Kabbalah. She was introduced to Jewish mysticism by actress Sandra Bernhard in 1997.[115] Her seventh studio album, Ray of Light, (1998) reflected this change in her perception and image.[116][117] She collaborated with then relatively unknown electronica producer William Orbit and wanted to create a sound that could blend dance music with pop and British rock.[118] American music critic Ann Powers explained that what Madonna searched for with Orbit "was a kind of a lushness that she wanted for this record. Techno and rave was happening in the 90's and had a lot of different forms. There was very experimental, more hard stuff like Aphex Twin. There was party stuff like Fatboy Slim. That's not what Madonna wanted for this. She wanted something more like a singer-songwriter, really. And William Orbit provided her with that."[118] The album garnered critical acclaim and Slant Magazine declared it as "one of the great pop masterpieces of the '90s".[119] Ray of Light was honored with four Grammy Awards, and Rolling Stone listed it among "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time".[120][121] Commercially, the album peaked at number one in numerous countries and sold more than 16 million copies worldwide.[122] The album's first single, "Frozen", became Madonna's first single to debut at number one in the UK, while in the U.S. it became her sixth number-two single and set another record for Madonna as the artist with the most number two hits.[37][123] The second single, "Ray of Light", debuted at number five on the Billboard Hot 100.[124]
The 1998 edition of Guinness Book of World Records stated: "No female artist has sold more records than Madonna around the world".[125] In 1999, Madonna signed to play a violin teacher in the film Music of the Heart but left the project, citing "creative differences" with director Wes Craven.[126] She recorded the single "Beautiful Stranger" for the 1999 film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. It reached number 19 on the Hot 100 solely on radio airplay and earned Madonna a Grammy Award for "Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media".[37][75]
In 2000, Madonna starred in the film, The Next Best Thing, and contributed two songs to the film's soundtrack: "Time Stood Still" and the international hit "American Pie", a cover version of Don McLean's 1971 song.[127] She released her eighth studio album, Music, in September 2000. It featured elements from the electronica-inspired Ray of Light era, and catered to her gay audience. Collaborating with French producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï, Madonna commented: "I love to work with the weirdos that no one knows about—the people who have raw talent and who are making music unlike anyone else out there. Music is the future of sound."[128] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that "Music blows by in a kaleidoscopic rush of color, technique, style and substance. It has so many depth and layers that it's easily as self-aware and earnest as Ray of Light."[129] The album took the number-one position in more than 20 countries worldwide and sold four million copies in the first ten days.[120] In the U.S., Music debuted at the top, and became her first number-one album in eleven years since Like a Prayer.[130] It produced three singles: the Hot 100 number one "Music", "Don't Tell Me", and "What It Feels Like for a Girl".[37] The music video of "What It Feels Like for a Girl" depicted Madonna committing acts of crime and vandalism, and was banned by MTV and VH1.[131]
In 1999, Madonna met her second husband director Guy Ritchie. On August 11, 2000, she gave birth three weeks earlier than expected to their son Rocco John Ritchie in Los Angeles. Rocco and Madonna suffered complications from the birth due to her experiencing placenta praevia. He was christened at Dornoch Cathedral in Dornoch, Scotland, on December 21, 2000. Madonna married Ritchie the following day at nearby Skibo Castle.[132][133] Her fifth concert tour, titled Drowned World Tour, started in April 2001.[50] The tour visited cities in the U.S. and Europe and was the highest-grossing concert tour of the year by a solo artist, earning $75 million from 47 sold-out shows.[134] She also released her second greatest-hits collection, titled GHV2, to coincide with the home video release of the tour. GHV2 debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200.[135]
Madonna starred in the film Swept Away, directed by Ritchie. Released direct-to-video in the UK, the film was a commercial and critical failure.[136] In May 2002 she appeared in London in the West End play Up For Grabs at the Wyndhams Theatre (billed as 'Madonna Ritchie'), to universally bad reviews and was described as "the evening's biggest disappointment" by one.[137][138][139] That October, she released "Die Another Day", the title song of the James Bond film Die Another Day, in which she had a cameo role, described by The Guardian film reviewer as "incredibly wooden".[140] The song reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and was nominated for both a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and a Golden Raspberry for Worst Song.[37]
Following Die Another Day, Madonna collaborated with fashion photographer Steven Klein in 2003 for an exhibition installation named X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS. It included photography from a photo shoot in W magazine, and seven video segments. The installation ran from March to May in New York's Deitch Projects gallery. It then traveled the world in an edited form.[141] The same year, Madonna released her ninth studio album, American Life, which was based on her observations of American society, and received mixed reviews.[142] She commented, "[American Life] was like a trip down memory lane, looking back at everything I've accomplished and all the things I once valued and all the things that were important to me."[143] Larry Flick from The Advocate felt that "American Life is an album that is among her most adventurous and lyrically intelligent" while condemning it as "a lazy, half-arsed effort to sound and take her seriously."[143][144] The title song peaked at number 37 on the Hot 100.[37] Its original music video was canceled as Madonna thought that the video, featuring violence and war imagery, would be deemed unpatriotic since America was then at war with Iraq.[145] With only four million copies sold worldwide, American Life was the lowest-selling album of her career.[146]
Madonna gave another provocative performance later that year at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, while singing "Hollywood" with Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Missy Elliott. Madonna sparked controversy for kissing Spears and Aguilera suggestively during the performance.[147][148] In October 2003, Madonna provided guest vocals on Spears' single "Me Against the Music".[149] It was followed with the release of Remixed & Revisited. The EP contained remixed versions of songs from American Life and included "Your Honesty", a previously unreleased track from the Bedtime Stories recording sessions.[150] Madonna also signed a contract with Callaway Arts & Entertainment to be the author of five children's books. The first of these books, titled The English Roses, was published in September 2003. The story was about four English schoolgirls and their envy and jealousy of each other.[151] Kate Kellway from The Guardian commented, "[Madonna] is an actress playing at what she can never be—a JK Rowling, an English rose."[152] The book debuted at the top of The New York Times Best Seller list and became the fastest-selling children's picture book of all time.[153]
The next year, Madonna and Maverick sued Warner Music Group and its former parent company Time Warner, claiming that mismanagement of resources and poor bookkeeping had cost the company millions of dollars. In return, Warner filed a countersuit alleging that Maverick had lost tens of millions of dollars on its own.[154][155] The dispute was resolved when the Maverick shares, owned by Madonna and Ronnie Dashev, were purchased by Warner. Madonna and Dashev's company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Music, but Madonna was still signed to Warner under a separate recording contract.[154]
In mid-2004, Madonna embarked on the Re-Invention World Tour in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. It became the highest-grossing tour of 2004, earning around $120 million and became the subject of her documentary I'm Going to Tell You a Secret.[156][157] In November 2004, she was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame as one of its five founding members, along with The Beatles, Elvis Presley, Bob Marley, and U2.[158] In January 2005, Madonna performed a cover version of the John Lennon song "Imagine" at Tsunami Aid.[159] She also performed at the Live 8 benefit concert in London.[160]
"I tried several different things when Stuart [producer Stuart Price] brought me music. And it was like divine inspiration. It just clicked, like: 'This is the direction of my record.' That's what we intended, to make a record that you can play at a party or in your car, where you don't have to skip past a ballad. It's nonstop."
Her tenth studio album, Confessions on a Dance Floor, was released in November 2005. Musically the album was structured like a club set composed by a DJ with Keith Caulfield from Billboard commented that the album was a "welcome return to form for the Queen of Pop."[162] The album won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album.[75] Confessions on a Dance Floor and its lead single, "Hung Up", went on to reach number one in 40 and 41 countries respectively, earning a place in Guinness World Records.[163] The song contained a sample of ABBA's Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight), only the second time that ABBA has allowed their work to be used. ABBA songwriter Björn Ulvaeus remarked "It is a wonderful track—100 per cent solid pop music."[164] "Sorry", the second single, became Madonna's twelfth number-one single in the UK.[38]
Madonna embarked on the Confessions Tour in May 2006, which had a global audience of 1.2 million and grossed over $193.7 million, becoming the highest-grossing tour to that date for a female artist.[165] Madonna used religious symbols, such as the crucifix and Crown of Thorns, in the performance of "Live to Tell". It caused the Russian Orthodox Church and the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia to urge all their members to boycott her concert.[166] At the same time, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) announced officially that Madonna had sold over 200 million copies for her albums alone worldwide.[167]
While on tour, Madonna participated in the Raising Malawi initiative by partially funding an orphanage in and traveling to that country. While there, she decided to adopt a boy named David Banda in October 2006.[168] The adoption raised strong public reaction, because Malawian law requires would-be parents to reside in Malawi for one year before adopting, which Madonna did not do.[169] She addressed this on The Oprah Winfrey Show, saying that there were no written adoption laws in Malawi that regulated foreign adoption. She described how Banda had been suffering from pneumonia after surviving malaria and tuberculosis when she first met him.[170] Banda's biological father, Yohane, commented, "These so-called human rights activists are harassing me every day, threatening me that I am not aware of what I am doing..... They want me to support their court case, a thing I cannot do for I know what I agreed with Madonna and her husband." The adoption was finalized in May 2008.[171][172]
A clothing line titled M by Madonna, in collaboration with Swedish clothing retailer H&M, was launched internationally in 2006. The collection consisted of leather trench coats, sequined shift dresses, cream-colored calf-length pants, and matching cropped jackets. H&M said the collection reflected Madonna's "timeless, unique and always glamorous style."[173]
Madonna released the song "Hey You" for the Live Earth series of concerts. The song was available as a free download during its first week of release. She also performed it at the London Live Earth concert.[174] Madonna announced her departure from Warner Bros. Records, and a new $120 million, ten-year 360 deal with Live Nation.[175] She produced and wrote I Am Because We Are, a documentary on the problems faced by Malawians. The documentary was directed by Nathan Rissman, who worked as Madonna's gardener.[176] She also directed her first film Filth and Wisdom. The plot of the film revolved around three friends and their aspirations. The Times said she had "done herself proud" while The Daily Telegraph described the film as "not an entirely unpromising first effort [but] Madonna would do well to hang on to her day job."[177][178]
In December 2007, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame announced Madonna as one of the five inductees of 2008.[179] At the induction ceremony on March 10, 2008,[180] Madonna did not sing but asked fellow Hall of Fame inductees and Michigan natives The Stooges to perform her songs "Burning Up" and "Ray of Light". She thanked Christopher Flynn, her dance teacher from 35 years earlier, for his encouragement to follow her dreams.[181]
Madonna released her eleventh studio album, Hard Candy, in April 2008. Containing R&B and urban pop influences, the songs on Hard Candy were autobiographical in nature and saw Madonna collaborating with Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, Pharrell Williams and Nate "Danja" Hills.[182] The album debuted at number one in thirty seven countries and on the Billboard 200.[183][184] Don Shewey from Rolling Stone complimented it as an "impressive taste of her upcoming tour."[185] It received generally positive reviews worldwide though some critics panned it as "an attempt to harness the urban market".[186][187]
"Probably in many respects most of the songs [on Hard Candy] are [autobiographical]. But in more of an unconscious way. I don't really think about telling personal stories when I'm writing music. It just comes. And then a lot of times, six months later, eight months later, I go, 'Oh, that's what I wrote that song about.' But that's when I play the song for lots of people and they all go, 'Oh, I can totally relate to that.'"
"4 Minutes" was released as the album's lead single and peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. It was Madonna's 37th top-ten hit on the chart—it pushed Madonna past Elvis Presley as the artist with the most top-ten hits.[189] In the UK, she retained her record for the most number-one singles for a female artist; "4 Minutes" becoming her thirteenth.[190] At the 23rd Japan Gold Disc Awards, Madonna received her fifth Artist of the Year trophy from Recording Industry Association of Japan, the most for any artist.[191] To further promote the album, Madonna embarked on the Sticky & Sweet Tour; her first major venture with Live Nation. With a gross of $280 million, it became the highest-grossing tour by a solo artist then, surpassing the previous record Madonna set with the Confessions Tour; it was later surpassed by Roger Waters' The Wall Live.[192][193] It was extended to the next year, adding new European dates, and after it ended, the total gross was $408 million.[192][194]
Life with My Sister Madonna, a book by Madonna's brother Christopher, debuted at number two on The New York Times bestseller list.[195] The book caused some friction between Madonna and her brother, because of the unsolicited publication.[196] Problems also arose between Madonna and Ritchie, with the media reporting that they were on the verge of separation. Ultimately, Madonna filed for divorce from Ritchie, citing irreconcilable differences, which was finalized in December 2008.[197][198] She decided to adopt from Malawi. The country's High Court initially approved the adoption of Chifundo "Mercy" James; however, the application was rejected because Madonna was not a resident of the country.[199] Madonna appealed, and on June 12, 2009, the Supreme Court of Malawi granted Madonna the right to adopt Mercy James.[200] She also released Celebration, her third greatest-hits album and final release with Warner. It contained the new songs "Celebration" and "Revolver" along with 34 hits spanning her career.[201] Celebration reached number one in the UK, tying her with Elvis Presley as the solo act with most number one albums in the British chart history.[202] She appeared at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards on September 13, 2009, to speak in tribute to deceased pop star Michael Jackson.[203]
Controversy erupted when Madonna decided to adopt from Malawi again. Chifundo "Mercy" James was finally adopted on June 2009. Madonna had known Mercy from the time she went to adopt David. Mercy's grandmother had initially protested the adoption, but later gave in, saying "At first I didn't want her to go but as a family we had to sit down and reach an agreement and we agreed that Mercy should go. The men insisted that Mercy be adopted and I won't resist anymore. I still love Mercy. She is my dearest." Mercy's father was still adamant saying that he could not support the adoption since he was alive.[204]
Madonna ended the 2000s as the best-selling single artist of the decade in the U.S. and the most-played artist of the decade in the UK.[205][206] Billboard also announced her as the third top-touring artist of the decade—behind only The Rolling Stones and U2—with a gross of over $801 million, 6.3 million attendance and 244 sell-outs of 248 shows.[207]
Madonna performed at the Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief concert in January 2010.[208] In April she released her third live album, Sticky & Sweet Tour. It was her first release under Live Nation, but was distributed by Warner Bros.[209] Madonna granted American TV show Glee the rights to her entire catalogue of music, and the producers planned an episode featuring Madonna songs exclusively.[210] Glee: The Music, The Power of Madonna, an EP containing eight cover versions of Madonna songs featured in the episode, was released afterward and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.[211]
Madonna released the Material Girl clothing line, which she designed with her daughter, Lourdes.[212] The 1980s inspired clothing line, borrowed from Madonna's punk-girl style when she rose to fame in the 1980s, was released under the Macy's label. Madonna also opened a series of fitness centers around the world named Hard Candy Fitness. The gyms are a partnership between Madonna, her manager Guy Oseary and Mark Mastrov, the founder and CEO of 24 Hour Fitness.[213] The first of the gyms was opened at Mexico City in November 2010, as Madonna believed that the city served as "a great test market before bringing the gyms to cities around the world."[214] In November 2011, Madonna and MG Icon announced the release of a second fashion brand called Truth or Dare by Madonna to include footwear, underclothing, and accessories. The brand represents a second partnership between MG Icon and Macy's.[215]
She directed her second feature film, W.E., a biographical film about the affair between King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson; it was co-written with Alek Keshishian.[216] The film premiered out of the main competition at the 2011 Venice Film Festival, where it received mixed reviews.[217] Critical response to the film has been overwhelmingly negative, as reflected at Rotten Tomatoes website.[218][219] Madonna also contributed the ballad "Masterpiece" for the film's soundtrack, which won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.[220]
Madonna performed at Super Bowl XLVI halftime show,[221] which was visualized by Cirque Du Soleil and Jamie King and featured special guests LMFAO, Nicki Minaj, M.I.A. and Cee Lo Green. It became the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show in history with 114 million viewers, higher than the game itself.[222] It was revealed that the singer had signed a three-album deal with Interscope Records, who would act as the distributor in partnership with her 360 deal with Live Nation.[223] Her twelfth studio album, MDNA, was released in March 2012 and saw collaboration with various producers, most notably with her long-time collaborator William Orbit and Martin Solveig.[224] The album was well received by music critics.[225] Priya Elan from NME called the album "a ridiculously enjoyable romp", citing its "psychotic, soul-bearing stuff" as "some of the most visceral stuff she's ever done."[226] MDNA debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and many other countries worldwide.[227] Madonna surpassed Elvis Presley's record for the most number-one album by a solo artist in the United Kingdom.[228] The lead single "Give Me All Your Luvin'", featuring guest vocals from Nicki Minaj and M.I.A., became Madonna's record-extending 38th top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100.[229]
The MDNA Tour, which further promoted the album, began in May 2012 in Tel Aviv, Israel.[230] The tour has received positive critical reception,[231][232] but featured controversial subjects such as violence, firearms, human rights, nudity and politics. Lawsuits threatened against Madonna have also been engaged from the tour. It was a box office success and many venues were instantly sold out. Grossing over $305.2 million from 88 sold-out shows, The MDNA Tour ended as the highest-grossing tour of 2012 and the tenth highest-grossing tour of all time.[233] At the 2013 Billboard Music Awards, Madonna won three trophies for Top Touring Artist, Top Dance Artist and Top Dance Album.[234] In August 2013, Madonna was named the top-earning celebrity of the year by Forbes, earning an estimated $125 million, due to the success of the tour.[235]
In December 2012, it was announced that Madonna's Raising Malawi organization has built ten schools to educate 4,871 children in different locations in Malawi. The enterprise was in association with buildOn and follows the original announcement of building an Academy for Girls which was scrapped.[236] When Madonna visited the schools in April 2013, President of Malawi Joyce Banda expressed criticism of Madonna and her charity, accusing her of exaggerating her charity's contribution.[237] Madonna responded by releasing a statement saying she was saddened that Banda had chosen to act negatively about her endeavors. "I have no intention of being distracted by these ridiculous allegations," she added. Later, it was confirmed that Banda had not approved the statement released written by her press team and was "incandescent with anger" over the mix-up.[238]
Working with photographer Steven Klein, Madonna completed a 17-minute film called secretprojectrevolution (also stylized as #secretprojectrevolution).[239] The BitTorrent company was selected by Madonna to release the film as part of a Madonna Bundle. It was released on September 24, 2013, and consisted of the 17-minute film, its stills, a Vice interview and a message from Madonna.[240] With the film she launched the Art for Freedom initiative, which helped to promote "art and free speech as a means to address persecution and injustice across the globe". The website for the project has had over 3,000 art related submissions since its inception, with Madonna regularly monitoring and enlisting the help of other artists like David Blaine and Katy Perry as guest curator.[241] Madonna appeared at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in January 2014, performing "Open Your Heart" alongside rappers Macklemore & Ryan Lewis and singer Mary Lambert who sang their single "Same Love", as 33 couples were wed onstage, officiated by Queen Latifah.[242] A few days later, she joined singer Miley Cyrus on her MTV Unplugged special, singing a mash-up of "Don't Tell Me" and Cyrus' single "We Can't Stop" (2013).[243] In February 2014, Madonna premiered MDNA Skin, a range of skin care products, in Tokyo, Japan. The product was developed in collaboration with MTG, one of the foremost beauty care product developers in Japan.[244] During an interview at the opening of her fitness center in Toronto, Canada, Madonna confirmed that she has already begun working on her thirteenth studio album.[245] She later revealed that she was collaborating with Avicii and Natalia Kills.[246]
"[Madonna] is a brilliant pop melodist and lyricist. I was knocked out by the quality of the writing [during Ray of Light sessions]. The lyrics to "The Power of Good-Bye" are stunning. I love Madonna as an artist and a songwriter... I know she grew up on Joni Mitchell and Motown, and to my ears she embodies the best of both worlds. She is a wonderful confessional songwriter, as well as being a superb hit chorus pop writer... She doesn’t get the credit she deserves as a writer."
Madonna's music has been the subject of much analysis and scrutiny. Robert M. Grant, author of Contemporary Strategy Analysis (2005), commented that what has brought Madonna success is "certainly not outstanding natural talent. As a vocalist, musician, dancer, songwriter, or actress, Madonna's talents seem modest."[248] He asserts Madonna's success is in relying on the talents of others, and that her personal relationships have served as cornerstones to the numerous reinventions in the longevity of her career.[248] Madonna's approach was far from the music industry wisdom of "Find a winning formula and stick to it." Her musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images and a constant quest for new heights of fame and acclaim. Grant concluded that "having established herself as the queen of popular music, Madonna did not stop there, but continued re-inventing."[249] Musicologist Susan McClary wrote that "Madonna's art itself repeatedly deconstructs the traditional notion of the unified subject with finite ego boundaries. Her pieces explore, varios ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition."[250]
Throughout her career, Madonna has been involved in writing and producing most of her own music.[251] Madonna's early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979.[17] According to author Carol Gnojewski, her first attempts at songwriting are perceived as an important self-revelation, as Madonna said: "I don't know where [the songs] came from. It was like magic. I'd write a song every day. I said 'Wow, I was meant to do this'."[252] Mark Kamins, her first producer, believed that Madonna is "a much underrated musician and lyricist."[253] Rolling Stone has named her "an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics."[254] According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing "incredible" hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music. As an example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single "Into the Groove" and its line "Live out your fantasy here with me, just let the music set you free; Touch my body, and move in time, now I know you're mine."[255] Madonna's songwriting are often autobiographical over the years, dealing with various themes from love and relationships to self-respect and female empowerment.[256][257] Her songs also speak about taboo and unconventional issues of their period, such as sexuality and AIDS on Erotica (1992).[258] Many of her lyrics contain innuendos and double entendre, which lead to multiple interpretations among music critics and scholars.[259][260] Madonna was nominated for being inducted in the 2014 Songwriters Hall of Fame.[261]
"Papa Don't Preach" had Madonna singing in a much fuller voice, and incorporated classical instrumentation.
Composed with the darker electronic undertones, eastern strings and Middle Eastern percussion, "Frozen" features Madonna's previously unexplored vocal range.
Before emerging as a pop star, Madonna has spent her early years in rock music alongside her bands, Breakfast Club and Emmy.[262] While performing with Emmy, Madonna recorded about 12-14 songs which resemble the punk rock of that period.[17] Her early rock roots also can be found on the demo album Pre-Madonna.[262] Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that with her self-titled debut album, Madonna began her career as a disco diva, in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of. In the beginning of the '80's, disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop, and according to Erlewine, Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music.[263] The album's songs reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success, including a strong dance-based idiom, catchy hooks, highly polished arrangements and Madonna's own vocal style. Her second album, Like a Virgin (1984), foreshadowed several trends in her later works. It contained references to classical works (pizzicato synthesizer line that opens "Angel"); potential negative reaction from social groups ("Dress You Up" was blacklisted by the Parents Music Resource Center); and retro styles ("Shoo-Bee-Doo", Madonna's homage to Motown).[264]
Her mature artistic statement was visible in True Blue (1986) and Like a Prayer (1989). In True Blue, she incorporated classical music in order to engage an older audience who had been skeptical of her music.[265] Like a Prayer introduced live recorded songs and incorporated different genres of music, including dance, funk, R&B and gospel music.[55] Her versatility was further shown on I'm Breathless, which consists predominantly of the 1940s Broadway showtune-flavoured jazz, swing and big band tracks.[266] Madonna continued to compose ballads and uptempo dance songs for Erotica (1992) and Bedtime Stories (1994). Both albums explored element of new jack swing, with Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly saying that "she could actually be viewed as new jack swing's godmother."[267][268] She tried to remain contemporary by incorporating samples, drum loops and hip hop into her music.[269] With Ray of Light, Madonna brought electronic music from its underground status into massive popularity in mainstream music scene.[270]
Madonna experimented with more folk and acoustic music in Music (2000) and American Life (2003).[271] A change was noted in the content of the songs in Music, with most of them being simple love songs, but with an underlying tone of melancholy.[264] According to Q magazine, American Life was characterized by "a thumping techno rhythm, liquid keyboard lines, an acoustic chorus and a bizarre Madonna rap."[272] The "conventional rock songs" of the album were suffused with dramatic lyrics about patriotism and composition, including the appearance of a gospel choir in the song "Nothing Fails".[272] Madonna returned to pure dance songs with Confessions on a Dance Floor, infusing club beats and retro music with the lyrics about paradoxical metaphors and reference to her earlier works.[273] Madonna moved to urban direction with Hard Candy (2008), mixing R&B and hip hop music with dance tunes.[188] MDNA (2012) largely focused in electronic dance music, which she has embraced since Ray of Light.[274]
Possessing a mezzo-soprano vocal range,[275] Madonna has always been self-conscious about her voice, especially in comparison to her vocal idols such as Ella Fitzgerald, Prince and Chaka Khan.[264] Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition, called her "the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs", despite not being a "heavyweight talent."[276] According to MSNBC critic Tony Sclafani, "Madonna's vocals are the key to her rock roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs "straight," but Madonna employs subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did."[262] Madonna used a bright, girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became passé in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as "Minnie Mouse on helium".[264] During the filming of Evita, Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, "I studied with a vocal coach for Evita and I realized there was a whole piece of my voice I wasn't using. Before, I just believed I had a really limited range and was going to make the most of it."[277]
Besides singing, Madonna has the ability to play several musical instruments. She learned to play drum and guitar from her then-boyfriend Dan Gilroy in the late 1970s before joining the Breakfast Club line-up as the drummer.[252] This helped her to form the band Emmy, where she performed as the guitarist and lead vocalist.[252] After her career breakhtrough, Madonna focused mainly in singing but was also credited for playing cowbell on Madonna (1983) and synthesizer on Like a Prayer (1989).[251] In 1999, Madonna had studied for three months to play the violin for the role as a violin teacher in the film Music of the Heart, before eventually leaving the project.[278] After two decades, Madonna decide to perform with guitar again during the promotion of Music (2000). She took further lessons from guitarist Monte Pittman to improve her guitar skill.[279] Since then Madonna has played guitar on every tours as well as her studio albums.[251] At the 2002 Orville H. Gibson Guitar Awards, she received nomination for Les Paul Horizon Award, which honors the most promising up-and-coming guitarist.[280]
According to Taraborrelli, the defining moment of Madonna's childhood was the tragic and untimely death of her beloved mother.[3] Psychiatrist Keith Ablow suggests that her mother's death would have had an immeasurable impact on the young Madonna at a time when her personality was still forming. According to Ablow, the younger a child is at the time of a serious loss, the more profound the influence and the longer lasting the impact. He concludes that "some people never reconcile themselves to such a loss at an early age, Madonna is not different than them."[3]
Conversely, author Lucy O'Brien feels that the impact of the rape she suffered is, in fact, the motivating factor behind everything Madonna has done, more important even than the death of her mother: "It's not so much grief at her mother's death that drives her, as the sense of abandonment that left her unprotected. She encountered her own worst possible scenario, becoming a victim of male violence, and thereafter turned that full-tilt into her work, reversing the equation at every opportunity."[281]
As they grew older, Madonna and her sisters would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began drifting farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come to think that she resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry with Sylvia Plath being her favourite.[3] Later, Madonna commented: "We were all wounded in one way or another by [her death], and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself."[3] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. "Her death had taught [Madonna] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle."[3]
In 1985, Madonna commented that the first song to ever make a strong impression on her was "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'" by Nancy Sinatra; she said it summed up her own "take-charge attitude".[282] As a young woman, she attempted to broaden her taste in literature, art, and music, and during this time became interested in classical music. She noted that her favorite style was baroque, and loved Mozart and Chopin because she liked their "feminine quality".[283] Madonna's major influences include Karen Carpenter, The Supremes and Led Zeppelin, as well as dancers Martha Graham and Rudolf Nureyev.[284] She also grew up listening to David Bowie, whose show was the first rock concert that she ever attended.[285]
Madonna's Italian-Catholic background and her relationship with her parents were reflected in the album Like a Prayer.[59] It was an evocation of the impact religion had on her career.[286] Her video for the title track contains Catholic symbolism, such as the stigmata. During The Virgin Tour, she wore a rosary, and also prayed with it in the music video for "La Isla Bonita".[287] The "Open Your Heart" video sees her boss scolding her in the Italian language. On the Who's That Girl World Tour, she dedicated the song "Papa Don't Preach" to the Pope.[287][288]
During her childhood, Madonna was inspired by actors, later saying, "I loved Carole Lombard and Judy Holliday and Marilyn Monroe. They were all incredibly funny ... and I saw myself in them ... my girlishness, my knowingness and my innocence."[282] Her "Material Girl" music video recreated Monroe's look in the song "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend", from the film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. She studied the screwball comedies of the 1930s, particularly those of Lombard, in preparation for the film Who's That Girl. The video for "Express Yourself" (1989) was inspired by Fritz Lang's silent film Metropolis (1927). The video for "Vogue" recreated the style of Hollywood glamour photographs, in particular those by Horst P. Horst, and imitated the poses of Marlene Dietrich, Carole Lombard and Rita Hayworth, while the lyrics referred to many of the stars who had inspired her, including Bette Davis, described by Madonna as an idol.[74][289] However, Madonna's film career has been largely received negatively by the film critic community. Stephanie Zacharek, critic for Time magazine, stated that, "[Madonna] seems wooden and unnatural as an actress, and it's tough to watch, because she's clearly trying her damnedest."[290] According to biographer Andrew Morton, "Madonna puts a brave face on the criticism, but privately she is deeply hurt."[290] After the 2002 box office bomb Swept Away, Madonna vowed that she would never act in a film, hoping that her repertoire as a bad actress will never be discussed again.[290]
Influences also came to her from the art world, most notably through the works of artist Frida Kahlo.[291] The music video of the song "Bedtime Story" featured images inspired by the paintings of Kahlo and Remedios Varo.[292] Madonna is also a collector of Tamara de Lempicka's art deco paintings and has included them in her music videos and tours.[293] Her 2003 video for "Hollywood" was an homage to the work of photographer Guy Bourdin; Bourdin's son subsequently filed a lawsuit for unauthorised use of his father's work.[294] Pop artist Andy Warhol's use of sadomasochistic imagery in his underground films were reflected in the music videos for "Erotica" and "Deeper and Deeper".[295]
Madonna is dedicated to Kabbalah and in 2004, she adopted the name Esther which in Persian means "star".[296] She has donated millions of dollars to New York and London schools teaching the subject.[296][297] She faced opposition from rabbis who felt Madonna's adoption of the Kabbalah was sacrilegious and a case of celebrity dilettantism. Madonna defended her studies, saying "It would be less controversial if I joined the Nazi Party", and that her involvement with the Kabbalah is "not hurting anybody."[298] The influence of the Kabbalah was subsequently observed in Madonna's music, especially albums like Ray of Light and Music.[296] During the Re-Invention World Tour, at one point in the show, Madonna and her dancers wore t-shirts that read "Kabbalists Do It Better".[296]
Madonna and her dancers voguing at the 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour just like the music video of "Vogue". She was the first artist to have her concerts as reenactment of her music videos
In The Madonna Companion, biographers Allen Metz and Carol Benson noted that more than any other recent pop artist, Madonna had used MTV and music videos to establish her popularity and enhance her recorded work.[299] According to them, many of her songs have the imagery of the music video in strong context, while referring to the music. Cultural critic Mark C. Taylor in his book Nots (1993) felt that the postmodern art form par excellence is video and the reigning "queen of video" is Madonna. He further asserted that "the most remarkable creation of MTV is Madonna. The responses to Madonna's excessively provocative videos have been predictably contradictory."[300] The media and public reaction towards her most-discussed songs such as "Papa Don't Preach", "Like a Prayer", or "Justify My Love" had to do with the music videos created to promote the songs and their impact, rather than the songs themselves.[299] Morton felt that "artistically, Madonna's songwriting is often overshadowed by her striking pop videos."[253]
Madonna's initial music videos reflected her American and Hispanic mixed street style combined with a flamboyant glamor.[299] She was able to transmit her avant-garde downtown New York fashion sense to the American audience.[301] The imagery and incorporation of Hispanic culture and Catholic symbolism continued with the music videos from the True Blue era.[302] Author Douglas Kellner noted, "such 'multiculturalism' and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences."[303] Madonna's Spanish look in the videos became the fashion trend of that time, in the form of boleros and layered skirts, accessorizing with rosary beads and a crucifix as in the video of "La Isla Bonita".[304][305]
Academics noted that with her videos, Madonna was subtly reversing the usual role of male as the dominant sex.[306] This symbolism and imagery was probably the most prevalent in the music video for "Like a Prayer". The video included scenes of an African-American church choir, Madonna being attracted to a statue of a black saint, and singing in front of burning crosses. This mix of the sacred and the profane upset the Vatican and resulted in the Pepsi commercial withdrawal.[307] Madonna has been honored with 20 MTV Video Music Awards—the most for any artist—including the lifetime achievement Video Vanguard Award in 1986.[308] In 2003, MTV named her "The Greatest Music Video Star Ever" and said that "Madonna's innovation, creativity and contribution to the music video art form is what won her the award."[309]
Madonna's emergence occurred during the advent of MTV; Chris Nelson from The New York Times spoke of pop artists like Madonna saying, "MTV, with its almost exclusively lip-synched videos, ushered in an era in which average music fans might happily spend hours a day, every day, watching singers just mouth the words."[310] The symbiotic relationship between the music video and lip-syncing led to a desire for the spectacle and imagery of the music video to be transferred to live stage shows. He added, "Artists like Madonna and Janet Jackson set new standards for showmanship, with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing. These effects came at the expense of live singing."[310] Thor Christensen of the Dallas Morning News commented that while Madonna earned a reputation for lip-syncing during her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, she has subsequently reorganized her performances by "stay[ing] mostly still during her toughest singing parts and [leaves] the dance routines to her backup troupe ... [r]ather than try to croon and dance up a storm at the same time."[311]
To allow for greater movement while dancing and singing, Madonna was one of the earliest adopters of hands-free radio-frequency headset microphones, with the headset fastened over the ears or the top of the head, and the microphone capsule on a boom arm that extended to the mouth. Because of her prominent usage, the microphone design came to be known as the "Madonna mic".[312][313] Metz noted that Madonna represents a paradox as she is often perceived as living her whole life as a performance. While her big-screen performances are panned, her live performances are critical successes.[314] Madonna was the first artist to have her concert tours as reenactment of her music videos. Author Elin Diamond explained that reciprocally, the fact that images from Madonna's videos can be recreated in a live setting enhances the realism of the original videos. Thus her live performances have become the means by which mediatized representations are naturalized.[315] Taraborrelli said that encompassing multimedia, latest technology and sound systems, Madonna's concerts and live performances are deemed as "extravagant show piece, a walking art show."[316] In May 2014, the singer was listed by Billboard as the fourth highest grossing touring act since 1990, with total earned revenue of $1.14 billion and 9.7 million attendance at her shows.[317]

"With Madonna something happens that is unparalleled in the music and popular culture generally. She is her own current. Madonna ends inevitably present in the lives of almost all the singers in the world, either at the beginning or end of their races. She is the source of inspiration and goal to conquer."
—Juan Restrepo from Yahoo! about Madonna and her impact on music, according to his "All roads lead to Madonna" article.[318]
According to CNN, Madonna is "arguably the most influential female recording artist of all time."[108] Critical theorist Douglas Kellner described her as "a highly influential pop culture icon" and "the most discussed female singer in popular music."[319] Bill Wyman, editor of Chicago Reader, describes Madonna as a "genuinely freakish figure in popular music."[320] Marcel Danesi commented that "perhaps no one has understood the ambiguity of pop culture with regard to womanhood more than Madonna."[321] William Langley from The Daily Telegraph noted that Madonna "remains a permanent fixture on every list of world's most powerful/admired/influential women."[322] She is featured in the book 100 Most Important Women of the 20th Century, published in 1998 by Ladies' Home Journal.[323] In 2010, Time magazine included Madonna in the elite list of the "25 Most Powerful Women of the Past Century", where she became one of the only two singers included, alongside Aretha Franklin.[324] Additionally, Madonna has been as ranked 49th on the "75 Greatest Women of All Time" by Esquire magazine.[325]
Madonna also topped VH1's countdowns of "100 Greatest Women in Music" and "50 Greatest Women of the Video Era".[326][327] She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 10, 2008—her first year of eligibility—for "influence and significance on rock and roll music".[328] Additionally, Madonna ranked seventh on VH1 and People magazine's list of the "200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons of All Time",[329] She has also been included in the "100 Greatest Artists" of Rolling Stone.[330] Madonna has sold more than 300 million records worldwide.[331][332] Her worldwide commercial accomplishments have given her multiple Guinness World Records citations, including the title for the world's top-selling female recording artist of all time.[163] According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she is the best-selling female rock artist of the 20th century and the second top-selling female albums artist in the United States, with 64.5 million certified albums.[333][334]
In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked Madonna at number two, behind only The Beatles, on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, making her the most successful solo artist in the history of American singles chart.[180] Billboard editor Keith Caulfield declared in 2012: "She's the Queen of Pop and 'royalty on the Billboard charts'."[335] The magazine also dubbed her as the top-touring female artist of all time.[233] In 2011, Rolling Stone declared her as the all-time Queen of Pop and stated that "Madonna is a musical icon without peer."[336] Rolling Stone of Spain wrote that "She became the first viral Master of Pop on history, years before the Internet was massively used." Madonna was everywhere; in the almighty music television channels, 'radio formulas', magazine covers and even in bookshops. A pop dialectic, never seen since The Beatles's reign, which allowed her to keep on the edge of tendency and commerciality."[337] Within this theme, Laura Barcella in her book Madonna and Me: Women Writers on the Queen of Pop (2012) wrote that "really, Madonna changed everything the musical landscape, the '80s look du jour, and most significantly, what a mainstream female pop star could (and couldn't) say, do, or accomplish in the public eye."[338]

According to Forbes and other publications, "Madonna is a cultural icon, and undoubtedly one of the most successful entertainers of all time."[339][340][341][342][343][344][345] In the book series Madonna Style from Omnibus Press, author Carol Clerk wrote that "during her career, Madonna has transcended the term 'pop star' to become a global cultural icon."[346] Rodrigo Fresán commented: "Saying that Madonna just is a pop star is as inappropriate as saying that Coca-Cola is just a soda. Madonna is one of the classic symbols of 'Made in USA'."[347] Journalist and politician Sergio Fajardo felt that Madonna "is a very powerful symbol."[348] Professor Belén González Morales of the Autonomous University of Barcelona commented that "'the infinite dissection' of Madonna is like a body paradigmatic of the global age that emanating a tremendous amount of meanings..... Madonna has been become an cultural artifact and the object of desire and a queer icon.[349]
In 1990, Jon Pareles said: "Don't think of Madonna as one more singer clawing her way up the pop charts. Think of her, instead, as a continuous multi-media art project dedicated to examining notions of glamour and success, and the limits of mainstream sexuality."[350] William Langley from The Daily Telegraph felt that "Madonna has changed the world's social history, has done more things as more different people than anyone else is ever likely to."[351] As Pareles and Langley, music blogger Alan McGee from The Guardian felt that Madonna is post-modern art, the likes of which we will never see again. He further asserted that Madonna and Michael Jackson invented the terms Queen and King of Pop.[352] Professor John R. May in his book The New Image of Religious Film (1997) concluded that Madonna is a contemporary "gesamtkunstwerk".[353] Strawberry Saroyan stated: "You can separate Madonna's music, her image, her media antics, but why would you? To me, she's a storyteller, a cultural pioneer, and the important thing is her message — via music, videos, antics, whatever. And all of those things have been brilliantly of a piece. Madonna's ability to take her message beyond music and impact women's lives has been her legacy."[354] Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone wrote that "Madonna is the most media-savvy American pop star since Bob Dylan and, until she toned down her press-baiting behavior in the nineties, she was the most consistently controversial one since Elvis Presley."[19] Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt that "one of Madonna's greatest achievements is how she has manipulated the media and the public with her music, her videos, her publicity, and her sexuality." He added that "Madonna was the first female pop star to have complete control of her music and image."[355] Becky Johnston from Interview magazine commented: "[F]ew public figures are such wizards at manipulating the press and cultivating publicity as Madonna is. She has always been a great tease with journalists, brash and outspoken when the occasion demanded it, recalcitrant and taciturn when it came time to pull back and slow down the striptease."[356]
Throughout her career, Madonna has repeatedly reinvented herself through a series of visual and musical personae. According to professors Peter L. Rudnytsky and Andrew M. Gordon in Psychoanalyses: Feminisms "many critics laud her continual reinvention of self. They agrees that "this is one of Madonna's cultural meanings."[357] Fouz-Hernández agrees that this re-invention is one of her key cultural achievements.[358] Madonna reinvented herself by working with upcoming talented producers and previously unknown artists, while remaining at the center of media attention. According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, "In doing so Madonna has provided an example of how to maintain one's career in the entertainment industry."[358] Such reinvention was noted by scholars as the main tool in surviving the musical industry, for a female artist.[359] Bradley Jacobs from Us Weekly said: "What new idea has Cher come up with? Michael Jackson started out at the same time, and they're like apples and oranges. Overall, Madonna has always succeeded by staying ahead of curve."[360] Luchina Fisher from ABC News commented: "One thing you can say about Madonna: She's unpredictable ... has had more incarnations than the Dalai Lama."[360] In 2006, a new water bear species, Echiniscus madonnae, was named after her.[361] The paper with the description of E. madonnae was published in the international journal of animal taxonomy Zootaxa in March 2006 (Vol. 1154, pages: 1–36). The Zoologists commented: "We take great pleasure in dedicating this species to one of the most significant artists of our times, Madonna Louise Veronica Ritchie."[362]
Robin Crow felt that there's no one of in recent history who has mastered the art of reinvention like Madonna.[363] The New York Times critic Kelefa Sanneh commented: "When you imagine Madonna, you don't see a single image but a time-lapse photograph, with one persona melting and warping into the next. It's an open-ended process, and when she's at her brilliant best, it's easy to believe that she could keep reinventing herself forever."[364] Cultural critic Annalee Newitz felt that Madonna has given to American culture, and culture throughout the world, is not a collection of songs; rather, it is a collection of images.[365] Grady T. Turner, curator of Museum of Sex commented: "'I learned, like most people, not to rule anything out when it comes to her reinventions of herself."[366]
Madonna's use of shocking sexual imagery has benefited her career and catalyzed public discourse on sexuality and feminism.[358] As Roger Chapman documents in Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices, Volume 1 (2010), she has drawn frequent condemnation from religious organizations, social conservatives and parental watchdog groups for her use of explicit sexual imagery and lyrics, religious symbolism, and otherwise "irreverent" behavior in her live performances.[367] Professor John Fiske noted that the sense of empowerment that Madonna offers is inextricably connected with the pleasure of exerting some control over the meanings of self, of sexuality, and of one's social relations.[368] According to Andrew O'Hagan many cultural commentators and academics look on Madonna as a heroic opponent of the American establishment's cultural and political authoritarianism.[369] In Doing Gender in Media, Art and Culture (2009) from the publisher Routledge, the authors noted that the fact that Madonna, as a female celebrity, performer, and pop icon, is able to unsettle standing feminist reflections and debates is far more interesting.[370] The Times stated: "Madonna, whether you like her or not, started a revolution amongst women in music ... Her attitudes and opinions on sex, nudity, style and sexuality forced the public to sit up and take notice."[371]
Shmuel Boteach, author of Hating Women (2005), felt that Madonna was largely responsible for erasing the line between music and pornography. He stated: "Before Madonna, it was possible for women more famous for their voices than their cleavage to emerge as music superstars. But in the post-Madonna universe, even highly original performers such as Janet Jackson now feel the pressure to expose their bodies on national television to sell albums."[372] According to lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys, Madonna represents woman's occupancy of what Monique Wittig calls the category of sex, as powerful, and appears to gleefully embrace the performance of the sexual corvée allotted to women.[373] Professor Sut Jhally felt that "Madonna is as an almost sacred feminist icon."[374] Professor Camille Paglia from University of the Arts called Madonna a "true feminist" and noted that "she exposes the puritanism and suffocating ideology of American feminism, which is stuck in an adolescent whining mode." According to her, "Madonna has taught young women to be fully female and sexual while still exercising total control over their lives."[375] Madonna defended herself as a feminist in 2008, saying that though she "may be dressing like the typical bimbo", she is in charge of her own life and career.[376]
[A] quarter century after Madonna emerged, artists still use her ideas and seem modern and edgy doing so. Beyond the obvious Madonna wannabe 1980s singers, Madonna's influence is felt in artists from Gwen Stefani to Britney Spears to boy bands, who found in the 1990s there was an audience beyond the old rock crowd ... It's worth noting that before Madonna, most music mega-stars were guy rockers; after her, almost all would be female singers ... When The Beatles hit America, they changed the paradigm of performer from solo act to band. Madonna changed it back—with an emphasis on the female.[377]
According to the company Telcel "since her appearance on the music scene in 1983, no artist has called more the attention that Madonna ... has pushed the boundaries of the world of music, film and fashion."[378] RTL Television Belgium said that "Madonna is a key figure in the music."[379] Erik Thompson from City Pages stated that "in the early '80s, Madonna broke down a lot of the industry doors that young entertainers stride through so brashly and confidently these days."[380] According to Fouz-Hernández, female pop performers such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Kylie Minogue, Spice Girls, Destiny's Child, Jennifer Lopez and Pink were like "Madonna's daughters in the very direct sense that they grew up listening to and admiring Madonna, and decided they wanted to be like her."[381]
Howard Kramer, curatorial director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, commented: "Today's more-flamboyant female pop stars enjoy the freedom to make music and perform the way they do, but they didn't create that freedom. Madonna did the moving and shaking when she burst onto the pop-music charts in the early '80s."[382] He further asserted that "Madonna and the career she carved out for herself made possible virtually every other female pop singer to follow ... She certainly raised the standards of all of them ... She redefined what the parameters were for female performers."[382] Billboard editor M. Tye Comer stated: "Although Madonna had her influences, such as David Bowie, she created her own unmistakable style ... She wrote her own ticket; she didn't have to follow anybody's formula. She declared who she was ... and took possession of her music."[382]
Madonna has received acclaim as a role model for businesswomen in her industry, "achieving the kind of financial control that women had long fought for within the industry", and generating over $1.2 billion in sales within the first decade of her career.[383] After she established her own label, Maverick Records, in the 1990s it became a major commercial success from her efforts, which was unusual at that time for an artist-established label.[384] Michelle Goldberg said that "one thing that's always interested me about Madonna is that she's often praised as a brilliant businesswoman." She further asserted that "Andy Warhol did an enormous amount to change that idea in highbrow circles, but Madonna made it conventional wisdom to conflate art and commerce. She pioneered this kind of multimedia, 'life as performance art'."[354] As Goldberg, Strawberry Saroyan noted that "Madonna is a brilliant businesswoman and her legacy is partly that she morphs commerce and art."[354] Professor Colin Barrow of the Cranfield School of Management described Madonna as "America's smartest businesswoman ... who has moved to the top of her industry and stayed there by constantly reinventing herself." He held up her "planning, personal discipline and constant attention to detail" as models for all aspiring entrepreneurs.[385]
In 1990, with more than $125 million since 1986 and as the highest-grossing woman in entertainment, Forbes "suggested that she was one of the smartest businesswomen in the United States."[386] London Business School academics called her a "dynamic entrepreneur" worth copying; they identified her vision of success, her understanding of the music industry, her ability to recognize her own performance limits (and thus bring in help), her willingness to work hard and her ability to adapt as the keys to her commercial success.[387]
Morton commented that "Madonna is opportunistic, manipulative and ruthless—somebody who won't stop until she gets what she wants—and that's something you can get at the expense of maybe losing your close ones. But that hardly mattered to her."[388] Taraborrelli felt that this ruthlessness was visible during the shooting of the Pepsi commercial in 1989. "The fact that she didn't want to hold a Pepsi can in the commercial, clued the Pepsi executives that Madonna the pop star and Madonna the businesswoman were not going to be dictated by somebody else, she will do everything in her way—the only way."[389] Hazel Blackmore and Rafael Fernández de Castro in the book ¿Qué es Estados Unidos? from the Fondo de Cultura Económica, noted that: "Madonna has been undoubtedly the most important woman in the history of popular music and a great businesswoman in herself; creating fashion, breaking taboos and provoking controversies."[390]

=======================================================
1958August 16Madonna as ChildMadonna and Tony Ciccone welcome their first daughter, Madonna, nicknamed Nonni to avoid confusion with Mom. When Nonni is 5, her mother, 36, dies of breast cancer. Madonna's father later marries the family housekeeper, Joan Gustafson. "I didn't accept my stepmother when I was growing up," the singer later tells CNN. "In retrospect I think I was really hard on her." 
1978JulyBright Lights, Big CityMadonna, attending the University of Michigan on a dance scholarship, drops out after two years and moves to New York City, where she lives in a series of ramshackle apartments while studying and dancing with the Alvin Ailey and Pearl Lang companies. In 1979, she begins dabbling in New York's downtown music scene, eventually forming the punk-influenced Breakfast Club with boyfriend Dan Gilroy. Then she launches the rock group Emmy with drummer Steve Bray, a boyfriend from Michigan who helps write and produce dance club tracks that lead to her solo contract with Sire Records. 1982OctoberRock the HouseAfter four years of struggling to earn money modeling, dancing and singing, Madonna's first single, "Everybody," puts her over the top in the New York club scene. She meets John "Jellybean" Benitez, an in-demand deejay who produces "Holiday." The song leads to an appearance on Dick Clark's "American Bandstand" and ignites her career. Madonna and Benitez, who date for two years, "were a great team," a friend tells PEOPLE. 
1983June 27Madonna – The AlbumAfter landing on the dance charts in '82, Madonna releases her self-titled debut album, which includes radio perennials "Lucky Star" and "Holiday." "Borderline" becomes the first in a string of 13 consecutive Top 5 hits, a winning streak bettered only by Elvis and the Beatles. She later tells PEOPLE: "Everything following that was like, 'Oh my God! What's happening to my life?' You get caught up in that."
1984September 14Like a VirginVamping at the very first MTV Video Music Awards for her soon-to-be released second album, Madonna performs "Like a Virgin" on top of a giant white wedding cake, dressed in a white bustier, her trademark "Boy Toy" belt buckle and crucifix jewelry. Released on Nov. 12, the album becomes No. 1 in the U.S. for three weeks and sells 7 million copies worldwide by May. 
1985February 13Crazy for YouMadonna and Sean Penn are photographed together at New York's Private Eyes video club after meeting on the set of her Material Girl video. Within weeks, Penn travels to Michigan to meet her family, and she meets his at an L.A. performance. In August, the pair weds in Malibu in front of 200 guests.March 29Wannabes EverywhereMadonna makes her big-screen debut in Desperately Seeking Susan opposite Rosanna Arquette, reveling in the role of a wisecracking street urchin not unlike herself, but the singer's fanciful style eclipses her acting performance. Wannabes turn up all over the world, sporting leggings, lace gloves and bellybutton-baring shirts.  1986August 29A Taste of FailureMonths after Penn beats Madonna's pal and songwriter David Wolinski (Penn gets a $1,000 fine and a year's probation), Penn and Madonna costar in Shanghai Surprise. "I look back and think, 'Well, I invited it. I made some really stupid choices,'" says Madonna to PEOPLE. "It taught me to be more scrupulous."1987September 04The Controversy BeginsMadonna begins the final leg of her "Who's That Girl?" tour in Turin, Italy, and the Pope urges the faithful to stay away. He further condemns the singer when her statue is erected in Pacentro, the Italian town of her ancestors. More run-ins with the Church will lead to a boycott of her 1990 "Blond Ambition Tour" that includes Madonna's signature mix of Catholicism and sexuality.1989January 06Love Don't Live Here AnymoreAfter nearly four years of splits, spats and fistfights with paparazzi, Madonna files for divorce from Penn for the second time – she withdrew the first petition in 1987 at the urging of friends. "I do believe we all have soulmates," Madonna later tells PEOPLE. "I don't believe that we necessarily end up with them."

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          The remarkable, hyper-ambitious Material Girl who never stops reinventing herself, Madonna has sold over three hundred million records and CDs to adoring fans worldwide. Her film career, however, is another story. Her performances have consistently drawn scathing or laughable reviews from film critics, and the films have usually had tepid, if any, success at the box office. Born Madonna Louise Ciccone in August 1958 in Bay City, Michigan, she moved to New York and studied with renowned choreographer Alvin Ailey, joined up with the Patrick Hernandez Revue, formed a pop/dance band called "Breakfast Club" and began working with then-boyfriend Stephen Bray on recording several disco-oriented songs. New York producer/D.J. Mark Kamins passed her demo tapes to Sire Records in early 1982 and the rest is history. The 1980s was Madonna's boom decade, and she dominated the music charts with a succession of multimillion-selling albums, and her musical and fashion influence on young women was felt around the globe.Madonna first appeared on screen in two low-budget films marketed to an adolescent audience: A Certain Sacrifice (1985) and Vision Quest (1985). However, she scored a minor cult hit with Desperately Seeking Susan (1985) starring alongside spunky Rosanna Arquette. Madonna's next effort with then husband Sean Penn, Shanghai Surprise (1986), was savaged by critics, although the resilient star managed to somewhat improve her standing with her next two films, the off-beat Who's That Girl (1987) (although she did receive decidedly mixed reviews, they weren't as negative as those of her previous effort) and the quirky Damon Runyon-inspired Bloodhounds of Broadway (1989). The big-budget and star-filled Dick Tracy (1990) had her playing bad girl "Breathless Mahoney" flirting with Warren Beatty, but the epic failed to catch fire at the box office. Taking an earthier role, Madonna was much more entertaining alongside Tom Hanks and Geena Davis in A League of Their Own (1992), a story about female baseball players during W.W.II. However, she again drew the wrath of critics with the whodunit Body of Evidence (1993), an obvious (and lame) attempt to cash in on the success of the sexy Sharon Stone thriller Basic Instinct (1992).Several other minor screen roles followed, then Madonna starred as Eva Perón in Evita (1996), a fairly well received screen adaptation of the hugely successful Broadway musical. The Material Girl stayed away from the movie cameras for several years, returning to co-star in the lukewarm romantic comedy The Next Best Thing (2000), followed by the painful Swept Away (2002) for husband Guy Ritchie. If those films weren't bad enough, she was woefully miscast as a vampish fencing instructor in the James Bond adventure Die Another Day (2002).

      Wanted to play the role of Ginger in Casino (1995), but the role was given to Sharon Stone instead.
      Was good friends with Gwyneth Paltrow before she declined her invitation to join her Kabbalah study group in London. A similar thing happened to her friendship with Debi Mazar, who didn't like Madonna's participation in the Kabbalah.
      In his 38th annual Worst Dressed List published in January 1998, Mr. Blackwell wrote about her questionable taste in clothing the previous year, "Let's be blunt, yesterday's Evita is today's Velveeta."

      On January 25, 1989, Madonna had a $5 million contract with Pepsi to promote their product as well as cross-promote her new album, "Like a Prayer". However, on March 3, when the video for the first single, "Like a Prayer", was released, it caused international controversy, with images of burning crosses, murder, and racism, and Pepsi soon retracted their contract, after March 2, when the 2-minute commercial was only viewed once, during The Cosby Show (1984). The single later soared to Number 1 on the charts and stayed there for 3 weeks. She later thanked Pepsi for creating such controversy.
      Her film Shanghai Surprise (1986) was a box-office disaster, costing $17 million and grossing only $2.
      Appeared in a filmed stage play in 1980 called "In Artificial Light", in which she wrote her own part.

      A September 2000 Rolling Stone article estimated her worth as $650 million. Since then, she has released the album "Music", which sold 12 million copies, has had a 47-date sold-out worldwide tour, completed a movie, and released a greatest hits compilation.
      She campaigned for the role of Frida Kahlo, as did Jennifer Lopez, and tried to get a film made for numerous years. She had hoped to actually star with Marlon Brando as Diego Rivera, but due to her lack of box office draw at the time, the film idea went nowhere. After Evita (1996), she and Salma Hayek were both interested in films about the artist. Hayek's film won favor and was greenlit.

      In October 2000, Madonna won her fight against a cybersquatter using the domain name madonna.com to operate a pornography website. The UN World Intellectual Property Organization found that site operator Dan Parisi "lacks rights or legitimate interests in the domain name." Parisi claims that he was in the process of handing over the rights to the domain name to a US hospital, Madonna Rehabilitation, which has the domain name madonna.org, when the case started.
      She started fashion trends in 1984 with her unique look using rosaries and crosses as jewelry and black rubber typewriter bands as bracelets. Legions of adolescent girls mimicked her look and a Madonna clothing store was opened in New York. Again in 2001, another huge fashion trend was set off by the "Material Mom", this time with western wear - cowboy hats and mud-splattered jeans.
      In November 2000, she held a live concert at the Brixton Academy in London which was broadcast over the Internet. A record nine million people watched the event, making it the largest live webcast of all time.

However, the song became the subject of controversy when the Parents Music Resource Center's Tipper Gore, wife of former vice president Al Gore, called "Dress You Up" "vulgar music" after hearing her daughter Karenna listen to the song (along with "Darling Nikki" by 'Prince (I)'); and soon the PMRC listed "Dress You Up" as #8 on their "Filthy Fifteen" list, for the perceived sexual content in the song's lyrics, leading to the creation of the "Parental Advisory" labels.

      When the singer attempted to purchase a $1.2m apartment at Manhattan's famous San Remo high-rise on Central Park West, the residents' committee declined the singer's application.

      When I'm hungry, I eat. When I'm thirsty, I drink. When I feel like saying something, I say it.
      I think that everyone should get married at least once, so you can see what a silly, outdated institution it is.
      [from her book "Sex"] A lot of people are afraid to say what they want. That's why they don't get what they want.
      [to David Letterman] Listen, all you do is talk about my sex life on your show, so now you don't want to talk about my sex life when I'm on your show?!
      [in Elle magazine, February 2001] Can I just say that I find it really irritating that everyone beats up on Britney Spears? I want to do nothing but support her and praise her and wish her the best. I mean, she's 18 years old! It's just shocking. I was so gawky and geeky and awkward and unsure of myself.
      I sometimes think I was born to live up to my name. How could I be anything else but what I am having been named Madonna? I would either have ended up a nun or this.
      I live for meeting with men in suits. I love them because I know they had a really boring week and I walk in there with my orange velvet leggings and drop popcorn in my cleavage and then fish it out and eat it. I like that. I know I'm entertaining them, and I know that they know.
      Not only do we suffer from racism and sexism, but we also suffer from ageism. Once you reach a certain age you're not allowed to be adventurous, you're not allowed to be sexual, I mean is there a rule? Are you supposed to just die when you're 40?
      Fame can be very disruptive. It can be like a drug. It gives you the feeling that you're happy, it gives you the feeling of self-importance, it gives you the feeling of fullfilment... but it can distract you from what is really important.
      [on winning a French MRJ Career Award, January 2004] My ambition may be American, and I may have married a Brit, but my heart belongs to France.
      [from the documentary Madonna: Truth or Dare (1991)] I wouldn't live in Chicago cause it's too conservative, aside for the fact that Oprah Winfrey lives there.
      I know I'm not the greatest singer or dancer, but that doesn't interest me, I'm interested in being provocative and pushing people's buttons.
      I have two beautiful children and a brilliant, gorgeous husband. I have my work and my faith...If that's boring to some people, I can't tell you how much I don't care.
      [August 1984] A lot of people thought that I was a black artist before they saw my videos, because a lot of my music is more R&B oriented, and I think that I'm a white artist doing R&B music, getting played on pop stations. And I think that the kind of records I make are really changing people's ideas of splitting up and categorizing artists and I think that's opening ways for black and white artists as well.
      [August 1984] Videos might have a limited audience in one sense. But on the other hand, you could be reaching a lot of people that would never be able to come see you live. So I think they're definitely an advantage. Kids today worship the television, so I think it's a great way to reach them. When you perform on stage you're acting. That's a performance. If someone sticks a camera on you, what's the difference?
      [September 1984] I would like to ultimately achieve. I already told Dick Clark once on Bandstand (1952). So I repeat it again and annoy everyone who was annoyed before when I said it. I want to conquer the world.
      [June 1989] Everybody in our family studied a musical instrument. My father was really big on that. Somehow I only took a year or two of piano lessons and I convinced my father to let me take dancing lessons.
      [May 1984] When I first came to New York I was a dancer, and a French record label offered me a recording contract and I had to go to Paris to do it. So I went there and that's how I really got into the music business. But I didn't like what I was doing when I got there, so I left, and I never did a record there.
      [December 1985] So then I'm playing drums and we're getting gigs in certain downtown clubs like CBGB and the Mud Club, and Max's Kansas City. And I'm starting to write music for the band, too, like some songs, but they already had two singers in the band, so they would never let me get up and sing a song because what's the point? One day I finally convinced them: "I'll just play guitar and sing one song. Please, please, please". And they finally said, "OK". So then I got up to sing one song and the other guy went back to play the drums. And like I got a standing ovation.
      [December 1985] I befriended one DJ in particular and he worked at a club called Danceteria, which was one of my favorite clubs. And we talked a lot about music. I knew a lot about singers, and I knew a lot about different groups and stuff like that. And he said, "How come you know so much about this?" And I said, "I'm really interested in music". And he said, "Well, in what way?" And I said, "I'm a singer". He said, "No kidding?" And I said, "Yeah, and I just happen to have this tape right here". I mean, I was carrying this tape with me everywhere, at every club, waiting for the moment to pop it on somebody. So I said. "Would you play it?". And he said, "Well, I can't play it in the middle of the night. I haven't heard it. What if it's terrible? What if everyone stops dancing?" And I said
      [on Spice Girls] I like them. I know I am not supposed to. Every time someone says something bad about them, I say, "Hey, wait a minute, I was a Spice Girl once!"
      I do think that the birth of my daughter was sort of a rebirth for me. It made me look at life in a completely new way. And that made me appreciate life in a way I don't think I ever had before.
      When I was growing up I was religious in a passionate adolescent way. Jesus Christ was like a movie star, my favorite idol of all.
      [on Britney Spears] I feel really protective of her. Don't even ask me why. There's something about her. Even though she's terribly successful, for some reason I think of her as an underdog.
      [on her relationship with Britney Spears] I see her as my little sister. She asks me for career advice. For the most part, I try to make her understand this isn't real life and she can't take everything people say seriously. I can understand some of the stuff she's going through. I help her with that.
      I don't want people to dress like me anymore. Now, I want them to think like me. Dress like Britney Spears and think like me, and everything will be fine.
      I've learned from studying Kabbalah that if your happiness is based on people approving of everything you do, you're doomed to fail... Kabbalah helped me stand up and take responsibility for everything to do with me.
      I can be arrogant sometimes, but I never mean it intentionally. I can be really snotty to people but that's not anything new really. I always acted like a star long before I was one. If people don't see my sense of humor then I come off as being expensive, but I always endear myself to people when I find their weaknesses and they acknowledge it. It's the people who try to hide everything and try to make you think they're so cool that I can't stand.
      [about her famous appearance in 1994 on Late Show with David Letterman (1993)] That was a time in my life when I was extremely angry. The press was constantly beating up on me, and I felt like I was a victim. So I lashed out at people and Letterman was one of them. I am not particularly proud of it.
      I skip the huge breakfast. Once you eat it, I don't know how you can get up and move around...I go out and shoot some pheasants.
      You can't go to London and not start drinking Guinness. And I have been known to eat fried fish and French fries. When in Rome - right?
      [on the federal government's reaction in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina] I was just frigging devastated, it was a real sad day. I don't get how people can have all these facts and still turn away from them. 9/11 was too ambiguous. You couldn't prove how the government was somehow in on the deal. You could say, "Oh, that's just Michael Moore". New Orleans was undeniable irresponsibility.
      If you take everything I do at face value, you're going to be horrified. Or intimidated. Or insulted. Or bored.
      [May 2006] It is a struggle to balance my career with my children. I'm always going, "Oh God, I'm a crap mother". I want to get home and put my kids to bed. And then sometimes, if I'm spending a lot of time with my children, I think, "Oh God, I just want to be an artist".
      [about her daughter Lourdes] Sometimes she doesn't want me to come to certain things because she knows everyone is going to pay attention to me and then they'll treat her differently. I took her to school on the first day last year, and all these kids were buzzing around. She came home that day and she was really irritated and kind of bummed out, like people were playing this contest -- what would it be like to be Madonna's daughter?
      [on the adoption of her son, David] My husband and I began the adoption process many months prior to our trip to Malawi. I did not wish to disclose my intentions to the world prior to the adoption happening as this is a private family matter. After learning that there were over one million orphans in Malawi, it was my wish to open up our home and help one child escape an extreme life of hardship, poverty and in many cases death, as well as expand out family. Nevertheless, we have gone about the adoption procedure according to the law like anyone else who adopts a child. Reports to the contrary are totally inaccurate. The procedure includes an l8-month evaluation period after which time we hope to make this adoption permanent. This was not a decision or commitment that my family or I take lightly. I am overwhelmed and inspired by my trip to Malawi and hope that it helps bring attention to how much more the world needs to do to help the children of Africa. My heartfelt thanks for all the good wishes I have received and I hope the press will allow my family some room for us to experience the joy we feel to have David home.
      [Feb. 22, 2007] My kids don't watch TV. We have televisions but they're not hooked up to anything but movies. TV is trash. I was raised without it. We don't have magazines or newspapers in the house, either.
      [Feb. 22, 2007] My daughter has a problem picking things up in her room. So if you leave your clothes on the floor, we put them in a trash bag. She has to earn them back by being tidy. I'm a disciplinarian. Guy's [husband Guy Ritchie] the spoiler.
      [1978] When I came to New York it was the first time I'd ever taken a plane, the first time I'd ever gotten a taxi-cab, the first time for everything. And I came here with $35 in my pocket. It was the bravest thing I'd ever done.
      One of the hardest thing I've faced in my life was the death of my mother, and that's something I really haven't got over to this day.
      I want to be like Gandhi, Martin Luther King, John Lennon and Jesus, but I want to stay alive. (Sirius Satellite Radio interview)
      I am so terribly sad about Michael Jackson's death. I don't know what artist wasn't inspired by him. To be able to do what he did at such an early age was unearthly, everybody grew up in awe of him. To work with him and become friends and hang out with him was exciting for me. I used to love picking his brains about musical stuff.
      Younger people are generally more adventurous -- they're more open, more fun -- have you met many guys my age? Guys my age are married or divorced or grumpy, fat and balding.
      [on the making of A League of Their Own (1992)] I cannot suffer any more than I have in the past month learning how to play baseball with a bunch of girls (yuk) in Chicago (double yuk). I have a tan, I am dirty all day and I hardly ever wear make-up. Penny Marshall is Lavern -- Geena Davis is a Barbie doll and when God decided where the beautiful men were going to live in the world, he did not choose Chicago. I have made a few friends but they are athletes, not actresses. I hate actresses, they have nothing on the house of extravaganza.
      [on Edward, Duke of Windsor] I couldn't get my mind off the fact that a man gave up the throne for a woman. From my perspective, men since the beginning of time have fought to get on the throne. Men are power-seeking animals, so why would this man run away from power?
      Being blonde is definitely a different state of mind. I can't really put my finger on it, but the artifice of being blonde has some incredible sort of sexual connotation. Men really respond to it. I love blonde hair but it really does something different to you. I feel more grounded when I have dark hair, and I feel more ethereal when I have light hair. It's unexplainable. I also feel more Italian when my hair is dark.
      Y'all better vote for fucking Obama, O.K.? For better or for worse, all right? We have a black Muslim in the White House! Now that's some amazing shit. It means there's hope in this country. And Obama is fighting for gay rights so support the man goddammit.
      [ dressed in a Boy Scout uniform at the 2013 GLAAD Media Awards] I wanted to be a Boy Scout but they wouldn't let me join. I think that's fucked up. I can build a fire. I know how go pitch a tent. I have a very good sense of direction. I can rescue kittens from trees. Listen, I want to do good for the community.

Madonna is the most media-savvy American pop star since Bob Dylan and, until she toned down her press-baiting behavior in the Nineties, she was the most consistently controversial one since Elvis Presley. Her pleasure-celebrating dance music and outr é videos gave feminism a much-needed makeover throughout the Eighties, smashing sexual boundaries, making eroticism a crucial pop-song element, and challenging social and religious mores. Madonna later positioned herself as a doting mother and charitable international citizen, but to her detractors, she merely reinforced the notion of "woman as plaything," turning the clock back on conventional feminism two decades. One thing, however, is rarely disputed: At nearly every turn, she has maintained firm control over her career and image.
Born in Bay City, Michigan, Madonna Ciccone was one of six children. Her mother died when Madonna was six, leaving her father, a Chrysler/General Dynamics engineer, to raise the family. She began studying dance at 14 and, after graduating from high school in 1976, continued her dance studies at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She moved to New York in 1978, where she studied briefly with the Alvin Ailey dance troupe.
Her first crack at pop music came when a boyfriend let her sing and play drums in his band, the Breakfast Club. While in the band, she landed a brief job as backup singer and dancer with disco star Patrick ("Born to Be Alive") Hernandez. 
In 1981 she quit the Breakfast Club and started writing songs with a former boyfriend from her college years, Steven Bray. The two gained attention in the trendy New York club Danceteria, where the DJ, Mark Kamins, played her tapes; it was Kamins who took Madonna's demo to Sire Records and produced her first club hit, 1982's "Everybody." 
After a 12-inch single, "Burning Up"/"Physical Attraction," hit Number Three on the dance chart in early 1983, she began recording her first album with the high-profile DJ John "Jellybean" Benitez, with whom she became romantically involved. A few months later Sire released her self-titled debut, which peaked at Number Eight. It spawned "Holiday," a single that crossed over from nightclubs to radio, eventually topping out at Number 16 on the pop charts by the following year.
Madonna enlisted manager Freddie DeMann, who had guided Michael Jackson from the Jacksons' late-1970s slump through Thriller. DeMann soon had Madonna making history with a couple of titillating videos. In March 1984 "Borderline" (Number 10), with its video celebrating interracial love, was released; it was followed by "Lucky Star" (Number Four), whose video offered provocative glimpses of the star's navel. Public opinion was — and would remain — split. Most critics initially dismissed Madonna as a prefab disco prima donna offering style over substance; a few, however, saw something different and hailed her as a strong new female voice, BOY TOY belt and all. Madonna (Number Eight, 1983) sold more than 5 million copies.
In late 1984, the Nile Rodgers-produced Like a Virgin (Number One, 1984), with its chart-topping title song, shot to the Top 10 upon its release; it eventually sold more than 10 million copies. Doubtless inspired by her indisputable videogenic presence, DeMann had negotiated movie deals for Madonna (before her stardom, she had already acted in the low-budget indie film A Certain Sacrifice, landing her a small part as a nightclub singer in Vision Quest and the title role in Desperately Seeking Susan. 
Throughout 1985 Madonna was ubiquitous, appearing in both movies, with hit songs on three albums. By March, "Crazy for You (Number One), from the Vision Quest soundtrack, and "Material Girls" (Number Two), from Like a Virgin, were in the Top Five simultaneously. Her other hits were Virgin's "Angel" (Number Five) and "Dress You Up" (Number Five), and the club smash "Into the Groove," from the Susan soundtrack. Her Virgin Tour was the hot ticket during the first half of the year.
Also in 1985 Madonna married actor Sean Penn, with whom she appeared in the critical and commercial flop Shanghai Surprise (a film produced by ex-Beatle George Harrison). Then she hit the pop world with a musical left hook: "Papa Don't Preach" (Number One, 1986). The initial single from the 7-million seller True Blue (Number One, 1986) drew criticism for its message that young unwed women should keep their babies. As the lyrical content of Madonna's songs deepened, critical acceptance of her began to grow. Her subsequent 1986 hits were "True Blue" (Number Three) and "Open Your Heart" (Number One), followed in 1987 by "La Isla Bonita" (Number Four). 
Another ill-advised acting venture, 1987's Who's That Girl, was tied into a Number One, platinum album of the same name, which included the hit title song (Number One) and "Causing a Commotion" (Number Two). In 1988 she appeared in David Mamet's Broadway production Speed the Plow. The next year she and Penn divorced.
She returned to music in 1989 with Like a Prayer (Number One), and the title song's video — complete with burning crosses and an eroticized black Jesus — launched Madonna's biggest and costliest controversy thus far. Released in March, it was censured by the Vatican, and the public response prompted Pepsi-Cola to cancel the singer's lucrative endorsement deal. Despite that, "Like a Prayer" debuted at Number One. The international controversy only raised the singer's profile. Like a Prayer spawned four other Top 20 hits: "Express Yourself" (Number Two), "Cherish" (Number Two), "Oh Father" (Number 20), and "Keep It Together" (Number Eight).
Madonna hit her megastar stride in 1990, when she appeared as Breathless Mahoney with then-boyfriend Warren Beatty in Dick Tracy; its soundtrack, I'm Breathless  (Number Two, 1990), bore hits in "Hanky Panky" (Number 10) and the non-movie double-platinum single "Vogue" (Number One), which honored and revived the popular gay dance craze. 
In 1991 she scored hits with "Rescue Me" (Number Nine) and "Justify My Love' (Number One); the video for the latter fanned the flames of controversy yet again with its explicit depiction of various forms of sexual expression. She then oversaw the film Truth of Dare, a documentary of her Blond Ambition Tour dressed up to look like D.A. Pennebaker's Dylan movie, Don't Look Back. Madonna also became one of the first pop stars to speak out about AIDS and help raise money for research. 
The singer affirmed her business acumen in 1992 when she signed a seven-year, $60-million deal with Time Warner, guaranteeing release of all albums, films, and books under her Maverick production corporation. Her first Maverick project was a highly controversial 128-page coffee-table photo book, Sex, which had Madonna posing nude and wearing S&M gear. Sex was followed by the mostly panned erotic film thriller Body of Evidence and the album Erotica, which peaked at Number Two and produced Top Five hits in 1992: the tile track (Number Three, 1992) and "Deeper and Deeper" (Number Seven). "Bad Girl" (Number 36) and "Rain" (Number 14) were both Top 40 hits in 1993. 
By then, Maverick was releasing work by other artists, including hip-hop chanteuse Meshell Ndegéocello, and Madonna embarked on her worldwide Girlie Show Tour, which drew a mixed critical reaction. An appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman returned Madonna to the headlines in spring 1994, when, using an abundance of profanities, she engaged in a verbal sparring match with the comedian. 
She also returned to the pop chart that year with the Number Two single "I'll Remember," from the 1994 film With Honors. Her late-1994 album, Bedtime Stories (Number Three), presented a fairly traditional R&B sound and yielded the hit singles "Secret" (Number Four, 1994) and "Take a Bow" (Number One, 1995). The title track (Number 42) was cowritten by Björk. Madonna then released the compilation Something to Remember (Number Six, 1995), which gathered the singer's ballads with three new songs. She soon won the lead role in a film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Evita, a musical based on the life of Argentina's Evita Per ón. Evita gave Madonna her first real dose of vocal training and earned her favorable reviews; it spawned the hit singles "Don't Cry For Me Argentina" (Number Eight) and "You Must Love Me" (Number 18).
Despite her chameleon inclinations, Madonna stayed consistently within the dance world during the 1990s. Her only foray into rock came in a duet with brother-in-law Joe Henry on 1996's Sweet Relief II: Gravity of a Situation benefit album. She gave birth to daughter Lourdes in October 1996; the father was personal trainer Carlos Leon.
Madonna assumed an active role at the increasingly successful Maverick, personally approving every act signed, including the chart-topping Alanis Morissette. In 1998 Madonna released the soul-searching Ray of Light (Number Two, 1998), an album produced by William Orbit that explored the new sounds of drum and bass, trip-hop, and other forms of electronic dance music as well as Madonna's new interest in the Jewish mysticism called Kabbalah. It spawned the hit singles "Frozen" (Number Two), "Ray of Light" (Number Five), and "The Power of Good-Bye" (Number 11). Madonna then recorded "Beautiful Stranger" for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and a dance version of Don McLean's "American Pie" for the soundtrack of her film The Next Best Thing. Her collaboration with Orbit continued on 2000's Music, which debuted at Number One and generated the singles "Music" (Number One, 2000) and "Don't Tell Me" (Number Four, 2000); the majority of Music was coproduced by Mirwais Ahmadzaï. 
Madonna gave birth to a son, Rocco, in 2000, and in 2001 she married Rocco's father, British director Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels; Snatch). She also debuted her first major stage show since 1993, the Drowned World Tour, which mined her entire career in acts exploring punk, geisha, Western, Latin and urban motifs. The tightly choreographed show also featured the debut of Madonna's onstage guitar playing. Though the trek was hailed as an artistic and commercial triumph, Madonna weathered harsh reviews for her starring role in 2002's Swept Away, which was directed by Ritchie. 
Her next album American Life (Number One, 2003), another collaboration with Mirwais, was a darker, stark critique of modern consumerism that garnered less enthusiastic reviews. Its first single "Die Another Day" was penned as a James Bond theme, and "Hollywood" became most famous for its performance at the 2003 VMAs, where Madonna kissed Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. 
After demonstrating she still had the power to titillate, Madonna began work on becoming a concerned citizen of the world. She emphasized her seriousness about parenting by authoring a series of children's books called The English Roses and took to the stage at two prominent charity concerts, for victims of the 2004 tsunami and Live 8. (She also went on another trek called the Re-Invention Tour, which was chronicled in the concert film I'm Going to Tell You a Secret). She cofounded a non-profit organization called Raising Malawi to address the growing problem of orphans in the African nation, and ultimately adopted two children herself, David Banda and Mercy James (both proceedings were fraught with legal wrangling). 
In 2006, Madonna returned to the club for the future-disco album Confessions on a Dance Floor, which was largely coproduced by Stuart Price. The album opened at Number One on the strength of lead track "Hung Up," which reworked an Abba sample, though none of its singles ("Sorry," "Get Together" and "Jump") topped the Hot 100 in the U.S. However Madonna's Confessions Tour supporting the disc became the highest-grossing tour in history by a female artist (Madonna later beat her previous best with the record-breaking Sticky & Sweet Tour in 2009). 
As the accolades for Madonna's Confessions tour piled up, she signed a 360-degree deal with concert giant Live Nation worth a reported $120 million for future albums, tours, merchandise and film projects. 
Madonna was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Justin Timberlake in March 2008; fellow Michigan-natives and punk forefathers the Stooges performed "Burning Up" and "Ray of Light" in her honor. Just a month later, Madonna unveiled an album that paired her with Timberlake, Timbaland and the Neptunes: Hard Candy. The disc debuted at Number One; its most successful single was "4 Minutes" (Number Three, 2008), which featured Timberlake. Some of the album's lyrics seemed to describe a relationship in distress, and Madonna and Ritchie announced their split in October 2008 while she was still on the road for her Sticky & Sweet Tour. Madonna returned to the tabloids over rumored romances with New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez and Brazilian model Jesus Luz. 
For her final album on her Warner Bros. contract, Madonna looked back at her career once again in the 2009 retrospective Celebration, which boasted two brand-new songs: the title track, produced by dance-floor guru Paul Oakenfold, and "Revolver," which features Lil Wayne. In September 2009, she opened the MTV Video Music Awards with a lengthy speech examining the Michael Jackson's legacy and the parallels between their lives and careers. 
Madonna started off 2010 by reportedly beginning work on her follow up to Hard Candy and performing "Like a Prayer" during the international telethon Hope for Haiti Now. The song appeared on the download-only Haiti charity album, which debuted at Number One.

=======================================================
The best-selling female recording artist of all time, Madonna began her ascent to pop superstardom in the early 1980s, with a look and sound that inspired teenagers and worried their mothers. 
The astute business woman signed a $60million deal with Time Warner in 1992, founded her own super-successful music label, Maverick, and developed her reputation as a serious actress.
The ambitious girl was the eldest daughter born to Silvio "Tony" Ciccone, an Italian-American carworker, and Madonna Louise Fortin, who was of Québécois descent. She had two elder brothers, Anthony and Martin, and three younger siblings, Paula, Christopher and Melanie. 
A good student, Madonna won a scholarship to the University of Michigan in 1978. Impatient for stardom, she quit in her second year, moved to New York, worked shifts in a variety of low-paid jobs and started to battle for gigs.
Her boogie-tunes caught the ear of DJ Mark Kamins. He introduced the dancer-singer to Warner Brothers, who promptly signed her up. First she was a hit in the New York club scene, then 'Holiday' leapt across the radio waves, putting the single into America’s Top 20.
Warner Bros. released 'Like a Virgin' (1984). Its title track became the singer's first No. 1 single, and the album topped the charts. In 1985, Madonna sold more singles and albums than any other artist that year. Catching the financial optimism and growing popularity of music video and MTV, Madonna’s lyrics and image typified the aspirations of the mid 1980s.
Teenage girls became increasingly influenced by her fashions. Suddenly lace tops, skirts over trousers, fishnet stockings, jewellery bearing the Christian cross, and bleached hair became the look of a generation in the 1980s.
While filming the music video for 'Material Girl' in 1985, Madonna began seeing actor Sean Penn. The two were married later that year. The relationship was marred by Penn's abrasive nature and his frequent outbursts against the press. After filing and withdrawing divorce papers in December 1987, the marriage was finally terminated in 1989, shortly before she began a short-lived relationship with Warren Beatty.
Ever sensitive to the evolving mood of her audience, Madonna dropped the Material Girl persona, with the birth of her daughter Lourdes in the late 1990s. A new meditative, self-aware lyricism emerged in 'Ray of Light'.
Madonna followed up the success of 'Ray of Light' with 'Music', but the following 'American Life' album failed to impress either critics or fans. The album performed badly in the charts and it was only the world 'Re:Invention' tour in 2004 that helped elevate her profile once more.
She returned to form with her tenth album 'Confessions on a Dance Floor' released in November 2005, with its lead single 'Hung Up' reaching number one in 41 countries. The album also won a Grammy for Best Electronic/Dance Album.
Madonna embarked on her 'Confessions' tour in 2006, reaching 1.2 million people and grossing over $194million - the largest amount for her at that point.
She released her next album, the largely autobiographical 'Hard Candy', in April 2008. It was influenced by R & B and urban pop, and featured Justin Timberlake and Pharrell Williams. It reached number one in 37 countries. The lead single 'Four Minutes' reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100, making it her 37th top ten hit - breaking a record set by Elvis Presley.
The 'Sticky and Sweet' tour followed, making $280million - the most made by a solo artist - and it was extended into 2010 due to its success. In October 2010, Madonna opened a number of fitness centres called Hard Candy Fitness across the globe, and was the subject of a 'Glee' episode.
Her 12th studio album, 'MDNA', was released in 2012. The album's tour went on to become the tenth highest-grossing tour of all time and the highest grossing of the year. 
Her film career has been patchy, to say the least, with only Desperately Seeking Susan and Evita enjoying any acclaim. The less said about Swept Away, the better!
Madonna has also delved into the world of directing making her debut in 2008 with Filth and Wisdom. The comedy centred on three flatmates living in London and was also written by her.She attended the UK premiere of 'WE', which she directed and wrote, on 11 January 2011. It tells the story of American divorcee Wallis Simpson and her romance with Edward VIII, interspersed with a story of a Russian security guard and a married woman in the modern day.
Madonna married Swept Away director Guy Ritchie in 2000 and gave birth to a son, Rocco. In 2006, the couple were embroiled in controversy after they filed adoption papers for a baby boy named David Banda during a trip to an orphanage in Malawi.
After a passport and visa were issued for the child, Banda was flown out of Malawi. The adoption raised public concerns about whether special treatment was given to Madonna considering the fact that Malawian law normally requires one year of residence for potential adoptive parents.
Following their divorce, Madonna applied to adopt Chifundo 'Mercy' James from Malawi, which was initially accepted in December 2008 and then rejected as Madonna was not a resident of the country. After an appeal, she formally adopted Mercy on 12 June 2009. Madonna's charitable foundation Raising Malawi has built ten schools in the country. 
=======================================================
After stars reach a certain point, it's easy to forget what they became famous for and concentrate solely on their personas. Madonna is such a star. She rocketed to stardom so quickly in 1984 that it obscured most of her musical virtues. Appreciating her music became even more difficult as the decade wore on, as discussing her lifestyle became more common. However, one of Madonna's greatest achievements is how she has manipulated the media and the public with her music, her videos, her publicity, and her sexuality. Arguably, Madonna was the first female pop star to have complete control of her music and image.
She moved from her native Michigan to New York in 1977 with dreams of becoming a ballet dancer. She studied with choreographer Alvin Ailey and modeled. In 1979, she became part of the Patrick Hernandez Revue, a disco outfit that had the hit "Born to Be Alive." She traveled to Paris with Hernandez; it was there that she met Dan Gilroy, who would soon become her boyfriend. Upon returning to New York, the pair formed the Breakfast Club, a pop/dance group. Madonna originally played drums for the band, but she soon became the lead singer. In 1980, she left the band and formed Emmy with her former boyfriend, drummer Stephen Bray. Soon, Bray and Madonna broke off from the group and began working on some dance/disco-oriented tracks. A demo tape of these tracks worked its way to Mark Kamins, a New York-based DJ/producer. Kamins directed the tape to Sire Records, which signed the singer in 1982.
Kamins produced Madonna's first single, "Everybody," which became a club and dance hit at the end of 1982; her second single, 1983's "Physical Attraction," was another club hit. In June of 1983, she had her third club hit with the bubbly "Holiday," which was produced by Jellybean Benitez. Madonna's self-titled debut album was released in September of 1983; "Holiday" became her first Top 40 hit the following month. "Borderline" became her first Top Ten hit in March of 1984, beginning a remarkable string of 17 consecutive Top Ten hits. While "Lucky Star" was climbing to number four, Madonna began working on her first starring role in a feature film, Susan Seidelman's Desperately Seeking Susan.
Madonna's second album, the Nile Rodgers-produced Like a Virgin, was released at the end of 1984. The title track hit number one in December, staying at the top of the charts for six weeks; it was the start of a whirlwind year for the singer. During 1985, Madonna became an international celebrity, selling millions of records on the strength of her stylish, sexy videos and forceful personality. After "Material Girl" became a number two hit in March, Madonna began her first tour, supported by the Beastie Boys. "Crazy for You" became her second number one single in May. Desperately Seeking Susan was released in July, becoming a box office hit; it also prompted a planned video release of A Certain Sacrifice, a low-budget erotic drama she filmed in 1979. A Certain Sacrifice wasn't the only embarrassing skeleton in the closet dragged into the light during the summer of 1985 -- both Playboy and Penthouse published nude photos of Madonna that she posed for in 1977. Nevertheless, her popularity continued unabated, with thousands of teenage girls adopting her sexy appearance, being dubbed "Madonna wannabes." In August, she married actor Sean Penn.
Madonna began collaborating with Patrick Leonard at the beginning of 1986; Leonard would co-write most of her biggest hits in the '80s, including "Live to Tell," which hit number one in June of 1986. A more ambitious and accomplished record than her two previous albums, True Blue was released the following month, to both more massive commercial success (it was a number one in both the U.S. and the U.K., selling over five million copies in America alone) and critical acclaim. "Papa Don't Preach" became her fourth number one hit in the U.S. While her musical career was thriving, her film career took a savage hit with the November release of Shanghai Surprise. Starring Madonna and Penn, the comedy received terrible reviews, which translated into disastrous box office returns.
At the beginning of 1987, she had her fifth number one single with "Open Your Heart," the third number one from True Blue alone. The title cut from the soundtrack of her third feature film, Who's That Girl?, was another chart-topping hit, although the film itself was another box office bomb. 1988 was a relatively quiet year for Madonna as she spent the first half of the year acting in David Mamet's Speed the Plow on Broadway. In the meantime, she released the remix album You Can Dance. After withdrawing the divorce papers she filed at the beginning of 1988, she divorced Penn at the beginning of 1989.
Like a Prayer, released in the spring of 1989, was her most ambitious and far-reaching album, incorporating elements of pop, rock, and dance. It was another number one hit and launched the number one title track as well as "Express Yourself," "Cherish," and "Keep It Together," three more Top Ten hits. In April 1990, she began her massive Blonde Ambition tour, which ran throughout the entire year. "Vogue" became a number one hit in May, setting the stage for her co-starring role in Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy; it was her most successful film appearance since Desperately Seeking Susan. Madonna released a greatest-hits album, The Immaculate Collection, at the end of the year. It featured two new songs, including the number one single "Justify My Love," which sparked another controversy with its sexy video; the second new song, "Rescue Me," became the highest-debuting single by a female artist in U.S. chart history, entering the charts at number 15. Truth or Dare, a documentary of the Blonde Ambition tour, was released to positive reviews and strong ticket sales during the spring of 1991.
Madonna returned to the charts in the summer of 1992 with the number one "This Used to Be My Playground," a single featured in the film A League of Their Own, which featured the singer in a small part. Later that year, Madonna released Sex, an expensive, steel-bound soft-core pornographic book that featured hundreds of erotic photographs of herself, several models, and other celebrities -- including Isabella Rossellini, Big Daddy Kane, Naomi Campbell, and Vanilla Ice -- as well as selected prose. Sex received scathing reviews and enormous negative publicity, yet that didn't stop the accompanying album, Erotica, from selling over two million copies. Bedtime Stories, released two years later, was a more subdued affair than Erotica. Initially, it didn't chart as impressively, prompting some critics to label her a has-been, yet the album spawned her biggest hit, "Take a Bow," which spent seven weeks at number one. It also featured the Björk-penned "Bedtime Stories," which became her first single not to make the Top 40; its follow-up, "Human Nature," also failed to crack the Top 40. Nevertheless, Bedtime Stories marked her seventh album to go multi-platinum.
Beginning in 1995, Madonna began one of her most subtle image makeovers as she lobbied for the title role in the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Evita. Backing away from the overt sexuality of Erotica and Bedtime Stories, Madonna recast herself as an upscale sophisticate, and the compilation Something to Remember fit into the plan nicely. Released in the fall of 1995, around the same time she won the coveted role of Evita Peron, the album was comprised entirely of ballads, designed to appeal to the mature audience that would also be the target of Evita. As the filming completed, Madonna announced she was pregnant and her daughter, Lourdes, was born late in 1996, just as Evita was scheduled for release. The movie was greeted with generally positive reviews and Madonna began a campaign for an Oscar nomination that resulted in her winning the Golden Globe for Best Actress (Musical or Comedy), but not the coveted Academy Award nomination. The soundtrack for Evita, however, was a modest hit, with a dance remix of "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" and the newly written "You Must Love Me" both becoming hits. 
During 1997, she worked with producer William Orbit on her first album of new material since 1994's Bedtime Stories. The resulting release, Ray of Light, was heavily influenced by electronica, techno, and trip-hop, thereby updating her classic dance-pop sound for the late '90s. Ray of Light received uniformly excellent reviews upon its March 1998 release and debuted at number two on the charts. Within a month, the record was shaping up to be her biggest album since Like a Prayer. Two years later she returned with Music, which reunited her with Orbit and also featured production work from Mark "Spike" Stent and Mirwais, a French electro-pop producer/musician in the vein of Daft Punk and Air. 
The year 2000 also saw the birth of Madonna's second child, Rocco, whom she had with filmmaker Guy Ritchie; the two married at the very end of the year. With Ritchie as director and Madonna as star, the pair released a remake of the film Swept Away in 2002. It tanked at the box office, failing to crack seven digits, making it one of the least profitable films of the year. Her sober 2003 album, American Life, fared slightly better but was hardly a huge success; despite going platinum, it was her lowest-selling album to date. That same year also saw the release of Madonna's successful children's book, The English Roses, which was followed by several more novels in future years. 
Confessions on a Dance Floor marked her return to music, specifically to the dance-oriented material that had made her a star. Released in late 2005, the album topped the Billboard 200 chart and was accompanied by a world-wide tour in 2006, the same year that I'm Going to Tell You a Secret, a CD/DVD made during her Re-Invention Tour, came out. In 2007, Madonna released another CD/DVD set, The Confessions Tour, this time chronicling her tour of the same name.
She inched closer to the completion of her Warner Bros. contract with 2008's Hard Candy, featuring collaborations with the Neptunes and Timbaland. As poorly received as it was, the bold album boasted a Top Five hit in "4 Minutes," and it was supported with the Sticky & Sweet Tour, which concluded in September 2009 (a month prior to her filing for divorce from Ritchie) and produced yet another CD/DVD package, released in 2010. It was her final Warner Bros. release and set the stage for her long-term recording deal with Live Nation.
Madonna began work on her 12th album midway through 2011, with the goal of releasing it early in 2012. The subsequent full-length, MDNA, featured production from French electronic musician and DJ Martin Solveig, as well as longtime collaborator Orbit. The album's title, an abbreviation of Madonna's name, appeared on the heels of her performance at the 2012 Super Bowl. Preceded by the Top Ten single "Give Me All Your Luvin'" (featuring Nicki Minaj and M.I.A.), MDNA debuted at number one across the world, including the U.S. and U.K. Her MDNA Tour took up the rest of the year, visiting cities in Europe, the Middle East, North America, and South America. She filmed a concert special, and also released the live album MDNA World Tour in September 2013. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi

=======================================================
Madonna is one of the most recognizable names in the world – and not just the world of music. She became the first multimedia pop icon, crossing from dance-oriented pop music into movies, television, videos, fashion and books while achieving a level of celebrity comparable to that of a primary inspiration, Marilyn Monroe. Madonna has been a ubiquitous and, at times, controversial figure since erupting on the scene with her debut single, Everybody,” in 1982. No one in the pop realm has manipulated the media with such a savvy sense of self-promotion. Yet Madonna’s career has always had a solid musical footing, and her life – however outrageous and calculated at certain points – has proceeded on an unfolding path of self-discovery and open-hearted revelation.
As a fully liberated woman who’s lived life on her own terms, Madonna has been an icon to many since bursting on the scene in 1981. Certainly Madonna is one of the most fascinating, uninhibited and well-documented figures of the modern age, and her music has provided an ongoing documentary of her life and times. From the energetic dance-floor anthems of her early years to the introspective balladry of her middle period to the religious and political themes that preoccupy her later work, Madonna has offered surprises and challenges at every turn.
She was born Madonna Louise Veronica Ciccone, the third of eight children, in Bay City, Michigan. She dropped out of college and moved to New York in 1978, bringing only a suitcase and dreams of being a professional dancer. A European tour with a disco singer, for whom she danced and sang backup, led to a half-year in Paris before a return to New York and a turn in a New Wavish band called the Breakfast Club. During her scuffling years in New York, she taught herself to play drums, keyboards and guitar; did modeling work and odd jobs; danced with the Alvin Ailey and Pearl Lange troupes; and made inroads as a singer and dancer on Manhattan’s club circuit.
Her break came in 1982, when she signed with Sire Records (her label for the next 14 years), after famously auditioning for label head Seymour Stein in his hospital room. “She was singing with all her heart, and that’s what came across,” Stein recalled. “I wanted to sign her immediately.” At Sire, Madonna’s provocative persona and musical imagination were given free reign. In short order, Madonna exploded onto dance floors, airwaves and television, where she grabbed the attention of the first generation of MTV viewers. She became an early emblem of “women in rock,” helping dissolve gender boundaries in the music business to the point where that catchphrase has become unnecessary and even a bit anachronistic. She also deliberately pushed the envelope, openly offering sexuality as part of the package.
“I wanted to go, ‘Don’t tell me what to do just ’cause I’m a girl,” Madonna toldPeople magazine in 2000. “Don’t tell me I can’t be sexual and intelligent at the same time…. I’m happy to have been a pioneer.”
Madonna became one of the top stars of the Eighties, selling 60 million records worldwide, making headlines and achieving a level of pop celebrity rivaled only by Michael Jackson, Prince and Bruce Springsteen. She had seven #1 hits (from 1984’s “Like a Virgin” through 1989’s “Like a Prayer") and three #1 albums (Like a Virgin, True Blue, Like a Prayer) in that time. She also sparked debate and controversy with such songs as “Material Girl” and “Papa Don’t Preach.” She released four of the decade’s most high-impact albums – Madonna (1983), Like a Virgin (1984), True Blue (1986) and Like a Prayer (1989). They collectively logged eight-and-a-half years on the charts, making Madonna a ubiquitous presence. She also charted 20 singles in the Eighties, seven of which reached #1 – a number surpassed only by Michael Jackson’s nine.
Madonna also made her presence felt in films, appearing in Desperately Seeking Susan, Shanghai Surprise, Who’s That Girl? and Dick Tracy. She capped off an amazing decade with The Immaculate Collection, a compilation of 15 hits and two new tracks. The sexually frisky video for one of them, “Justify My Love” (written by Lenny Kravitz), triggered more controversy and moral outrage.
She fearlessly entered the Nineties by pushing the envelope even further on the Blonde Ambition World Tour. This elaborate stagecraft, choreography and costuming edged the concert experience closer to a ribald, eye-popping musical. An uncensored documentary of her life, onstage and off, was filmed with Madonna’s authorization. Titled Truth or Dare, it, too, made headlines, with some lauding her unvarnished honesty and others fretting she’d crossed the line again. But all this paled in comparison to the 1992 publication of Madonna’s X-rated picture book, Sex. It was accompanied by another envelope-pushing album (Erotica) and tour (The Girlie Show). That same year, she launched her own label, Maverick Records, in conjunction with Warner Bros.
Madonna’s more self-reflective 1994 release, Bedtime Stories, yielded the single “Take a Bow,” a ballad that became the biggest hit of her career. In 1995, Madonna played the lead role in Evita, a film biography of Eva Peron, the Argentinean leader and heroine. Her work earned the best notices of her film career and won her a Golden Globe for Best Actress. The Evitasoundtrack went to #2 and sold 4 million copies.
The singer’s budding interest in Kabbalah, a mystical religion deriving from Judaism, informed 1998’s Ray of Light. Madonna’s first album of new material in four years found her reassessing her life in light of a spiritual awakening. “It’s about my relationship to fame and how my image spiraled out of control,” Madonna told USA Today. “I convinced myself that [fame] was going to be enough to take the place of real intimacy. I was incredibly naïve.”
Mixing folk and electronica, Madonna’s 2000 release Music returned her to a more extroverted sound and outlook. The title track became her twelfth #1 single. By this time, Madonna was becoming more consumed by family life. She had a daughter (Lourdes) by a boyfriend, Carlos Leon, and a son (Rocco) by husband Guy Ritchie, a British videographer and filmmaker, whom she’d married in December 2000.
Madonna has continued to confuse and confound all stereotypes. Two and a half years after Music, she returned with American Life, which took a withering look at fame, fortune, consumerism and the contemporary political landscape. Proving she was still not averse to stirring up controversy, Madonna locked lips with Britney Spears during their August 2003 performance of “Like a Virgin” on the MTV Music Video Awards. A month later, she published the first of several children’s books, The English Roses, which became a best-seller.
According to The Guinness Book of World Records, Madonna is the Most Successful Female Recording Artist of All Time. She claims the second-longest string of consecutive Top Five hits - and the most by a female artist - with a run of 16 that extended from 1984’s “Lucky Star” to 1989’s “Cherish.”
The 2004 Re-Invention World Tour, documented on the CD/DVD release I’m Going to Tell You a Secret, found Madonna projecting a sexy athleticism and unabashedly contemporary outlook. Madonna’s career came full circle with the 2005 release of Confessions On a Dance Floor, which returned her to the dance-music realm she initially conquered with her self-titled 1983 debut album. At the same time, Madonna’s lyrics and neopsychedelic music echoed the more metaphysical territory she explored in Ray of Light. Wherever her muse takes her in the future is anybody’s guess – and that is half the fun of following Madonna.

Madonna is an American singer, actress, dancer and movie star. She has sold over 300 million records worldwide, making her the best selling female artist of all time. She has had a profound influence on pop culture often courting controversy for upsetting religious and moral sensibilities.
Madonna, born Louis Cicconi, in 1958, was brought up in Rochester Hills Michigan. Her mother died, from breast cancer, when she was only five; she was brought up by her grandparents. She was raised a Roman Catholic, though from an early age she displayed a rebellious streak. In 1978, she dropped out of college and moved to New York, with barely the clothes she was standing in. She got a job as a waitress at Dunking Donuts, and in her spare time learnt modern dance. She temporarily joined a rock band ' The Breakfast Club' but tried to make a solo career and gaining the favourable impressionwith Sire Records, she was given a recording contract.
In 1982 she released her first single 'Everybody' and in 1983, she launched her first album 'Madonna' It sold very well, but it was her next album 'Like a Virgin' which made her into an international superstar. The album sold over 12 million copies, helped by the hit single 'Like a Virgin' which stayed at number one for 6 weeks.
As well as being a successful music recording artist, Madonna was very influential in influencing fashion and attitudes to life. Her trademark looks included fish net stockings, a Christian cross, bleached hair and Capri skirts.
Throughout her career, Madonna has courted controversy for her mix of sexuality and religious imagery. Her attitudes sparked criticism from the Vatican and the Vatican discouraged people from attending her concerts because of the eroticism.  Madonna, generally, remained unapologetic and continued to perform her routines.
After forming her own company - Madonna, produced a book titled 'Sex'. It featured nude photography and was quite controversial, especially in US; but it sold over half a million copies.
She has acted in a couple of films, without much commercial success - though her appearance in Evita about Eva Peron, the famous Argentinean wife of the President received good reviews.
She has now produced over 10 albums and remains a very influential artist still capable of hitting the top of the album charts. According to Billboard magazine, she is second only to the Beatles in terms of all-time best selling artist.        
Her early Catholic roots influenced her music and videos, but, in the early 1990s she embraced Kabbalah a Jewish mystical sect.        In 2004, she adopted the Kabbalah name 'Esther' which in Persian means star.

From Chapter One – “I grew up in a world of violence and unpredictability. I learned to protect myself the best I could. I learned to take care of myself because no one else would. I learned to lie, to conceal, and to cover my fear with anger and violence.
