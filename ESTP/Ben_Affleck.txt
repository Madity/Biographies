He first came to attention for his performances in Dazed & Confused, the Kevin Smith films Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997), and Dogma (1999). Affleck later gained recognition as a writer when he won the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Screenplay for Good Will Hunting (1997); he co-wrote and co-starred in the film alongside childhood friend Matt Damon. He later achieved international recognition for appearing in films such as Armageddon (1998), Pearl Harbor (2001), Changing Lanes (2002), The Sum of All Fears (2002), Daredevil (2003), Hollywoodland (2006), State of Play (2009), and The Town (2010). In late 2014, he will star in David Fincher's Gone Girl and in 2016 will portray Batman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.
Affleck has directed three films. He gained recognition for his directorial debut Gone Baby Gone (2007), winning the National Board of Review Award for Best Directorial Debut. He then directed and starred in The Town (2010) and Argo (2012), for which he won the Golden Globe Award, BAFTA, and Directors Guild Award for Best Director, and the Golden Globe Award, BAFTA, the Producers Guild Award, and the Academy Award for Best Picture. He will direct and adapt the novel Live by Night for a 2016 theatrical release.
As film producers, Affleck and Matt Damon founded the production company LivePlanet in 2000, and Pearl Street Films in 2012. Affleck has a younger brother, actor Casey Affleck, whom he has worked with on several films, including Good Will Hunting and Gone Baby Gone. In addition to film work, Affleck is actively involved in politics and charitable causes; he is the founder of the Eastern Congo Initiative. He has been married to Jennifer Garner since June 2005, and they have two daughters and a son.
Benjamin Géza Affleck-Boldt was born in Berkeley, California on August 15, 1972.[1][2] His parents named him Géza after a Hungarian friend who survived the Holocaust.[3][4] His ancestry includes Irish, English, Scottish, German, Swedish, and French.[5][6] The family moved to Massachusetts when he was two;[7] living in Falmouth, where his brother Casey was born, before settling in Cambridge.[8] His mother, Christopher Anne "Chris" Affleck (née Boldt),[9] was raised on New York's Upper East Side by her mother Elizabeth Shaw (née Roberts), director of public information at the Museum of Modern Art for over thirty years,[10][11] and her mother's second husband, Samuel Shaw, an attorney who served in World War II.[12][13][14][15] Her father, O'Brien "Obie" Boldt, was a Democratic activist and professor of political science at the City University of New York.[16][17][18][19] Chris was educated at Radcliffe College and Harvard University,[20][21] was a Mississippi freedom rider in the 1960s, and taught at The Brearley School before becoming a public elementary school teacher.[22][23]
Affleck's father, Timothy Byers Affleck of Rhode Island, was a stage manager, director, writer and actor with the Theater Company of Boston in the mid-1960s[24][25][26] and worked alongside Dustin Hoffman,[27][28] Robert Duvall, Blythe Danner,[29] Jon Voight[30][31] and James Woods.[32][33] During Affleck's childhood, he worked as an auto mechanic,[7] a carpenter,[34] a bookie,[30][35] an electrician,[29] a bartender[36] and a janitor at Harvard University.[37][2][38][39] While Affleck has described his father as a "very gifted writer and thinker",[30] his chronic alcoholism often made Affleck's childhood "scary and trying."[29][3] His parents divorced when he was eleven and Affleck was raised by his mother.[4][32] His father's life "hit the skids" in Affleck's teens.[3][40][30] When Affleck was sixteen, his father moved to Indio, California, entered rehab, became an addiction counsellor and later reconnected with his adult sons.[41][42][43][29]
Affleck was raised in a "very left-wing", "working middle-class" household in the Central Square area of Cambridge.[30][44] Affleck and his brother were surrounded by people who worked in the arts, were regularly taken to the theater by their mother, and were encouraged to make their own home movies.[45][8][46] David Wheeler, a family friend, was Affleck's acting coach and later described him as a "very bright and intensely curious" child.[47][48] Affleck's mother was friends with a local casting director, who encouraged Affleck and his brother to audition for roles in local productions.[36][49] Affleck had acting jobs from the age of seven but his mother wanted her children to have a normal childhood; she saved Affleck's wages in a college trust fund and only allowed him to audition during school holidays.[44][50][8][32][32] When Affleck was thirteen, he filmed a children's television programme in Mexico; he spent nearly a year travelling around the country with his mother and brother and learned to speak Spanish.[51][8][52] Speaking in 2013, Affleck admitted he has mixed feelings about being a child actor.[53][8][54]
At age eight, Affleck became friends with ten-year-old Matt Damon, who lived two blocks away and had recently moved back to the area.[55] Their mothers, who both worked in education and were acquaintances, made the introduction and encouraged them to spend time together.[56][57] Their circle of friends included Casey Affleck and future screenwriter Aaron Stockard.[49][58] The pair became extremely close while high school students at Cambridge Rindge and Latin.[8] Although they were in different grades, they had "identical interests" and spent their lunch breaks discussing their plans to become actors.[56][59][8] Both were greatly inspired by their high school drama teacher Gerry Speca, who encouraged them to write their own plays.[60][61][62] Affleck and Damon had many summer jobs together, working as construction workers and cinema ushers.[63][64][58] As teenagers, they travelled to New York for acting auditions, saving money for train and airline tickets in a joint bank account.[65][59]
While Affleck had good SAT scores,[32][44] he was an unfocused high school student with poor attendance.[3][40][32] He was accepted by the University of Virginia but instead followed a girlfriend to the University of Vermont, where he took Spanish classes.[44] He left the university months later with no credits, after fracturing his hip and realizing his love was unrequited.[66] He then moved to Los Angeles, studying Middle Eastern affairs at Occidental College for a year and a half.[67][68][69] He dropped out when a creative writing professor ridiculed an early draft of the Good Will Hunting screenplay.[30][70]
Affleck first appeared, at the age of seven, in Dark Side of the Street, an independent film directed by a family friend.[50][71] Aside from a Burger King commercial,[62] a 1986 ABC after-school special called Wanted: A Perfect Man[72] and the television movie Hands of a Stranger,[73] Affleck's biggest success as a child actor came when he was eight. He starred in the PBS children's series The Voyage of the Mimi (1984), produced for sixth-grade science classes.[74] The second season, The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988), was filmed in Mexico when Affleck was thirteen; he spent a year travelling around the country with his mother and brother and learned to speak Spanish.[75][76][52] Affleck and Matt Damon appeared together in a commercial for T.J. Maxx[77][78] and as extras in Field of Dreams.[79]
After moving to LA, Affleck and Damon befriended other aspiring actors including Cole Hauser, Rory Cochrane and Matthew McConaughey.[80] Affleck and Damon lived with friends in apartments all over LA.[34] In the 1990s, he had roles in Lifestories: Families in Crisis, as a steroid-abusing athlete, as well as in several films, including School Ties (1992),[81] Dazed and Confused (1993),[82] Mallrats (1995),[83] and Chasing Amy (1997).[84] Mallrats and Amy marked the beginning of his collaboration with writer/director Kevin Smith, whom he said in 2007 "is responsible for a great deal throughout my career."[85] Affleck also starred on several Saturday Night Live episodes early in his career. He appeared in Hands of a Stranger, a 1987 mini-series; and was Patrick Duffy’s son in Danielle Steel’s Daddy in 1991. He played a footballer in the swiftly cancelled series Against the Grain, and a high school sportsman who abuses steroids in Body to Die For: The Aaron Henry Story. He made a brief appearance in the movie Buffy the Vampire Slayer. While at university, he directed a 16-minute student film called I Killed My Lesbian Wife, Hung Her on a Meat Hook, and Now I Have a Three-Picture Deal at Disney.[86][87][88]
Affleck came to national attention working with Damon in Good Will Hunting in 1997,[89] for which they shared writing credit and received the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.[90] They also starred in the film. Good Will Hunting's success transformed Affleck from a virtual unknown into a celebrity. The screenplay originated with Damon writing a 40-page script for Anthony Kubiak's playwriting class at Harvard. Damon asked Affleck to act out the scenes with him for the class and, when Damon later moved into Affleck's LA apartment, they began writing the script in earnest.[56][36] Affleck later said that much of the "resentment" about Harvard evident in Good Will Hunting came from his insecurity about not attending a "fancy" university.[42] Affleck's father's life was an inspiration for the film.[34] Terrence Malick, a friend of Affleck's godfather, agreed to meet with the pair to give notes on their script.[55] Affleck has said that period in his life was "dreamlike": "It was like one of those scenes in an old movie when a newspaper comes spinning out of the black on to the screen. You know, 'Hundred Million Box Office! Awards!'"[66]
Affleck starred in Armageddon (1998) opposite Bruce Willis.[91] The film received mixed to negative critical reviews,[92] but was a box-office success, earning $553 million worldwide.[93] Affleck later described it as a "magical", ""Hey, I've made it" experience.[94] In 1998, he also starred in the Oscar-winning Shakespeare in Love with Gwyneth Paltrow. In 1999, he co-starred with Sandra Bullock in the romantic comedy Forces of Nature.[95] He then starred in Bounce with Gwyneth Paltrow.[96] In 2001, Affleck collaborated with Armageddon director Michael Bay in the war film Pearl Harbor. The film opened to a mixed to negative reception,[97][98] but was a box-office success, earning $449 million worldwide.[99]
In 2002, he was cast as Jack Ryan, a role previously played by Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford, in the fourth film in the techno-thriller series The Sum of All Fears. The movie, which ignored the story lines of the previous Jack Ryan films, also starred Morgan Freeman.[100] Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post wrote that Affleck and Freeman "create a believable chemistry".[101] In the same year, Affleck starred opposite Samuel L. Jackson in the popular thriller Changing Lanes.[102][103]
The following year, he starred as Matt Murdock/Daredevil in Mark Steven Johnson's film Daredevil (2003). Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a kid[104] and explained why he took the role by saying "Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them. This story was that for me."[105] He also said "I didn't want someone else to do it, because I was afraid that they would go out and do it different from the comic and screw it up."[106] Roger Ebert, in review of Daredevil, wrote that both Affleck and co‑star Jennifer Garner were suitable for their roles.[107] Daredevil grossed over $179 million worldwide.[93]
Despite some critical missteps, his box-office successes reportedly earned Affleck an average of $15 million per film.[108] Following Daredevil, Affleck starred in several critically panned box-office flops, including Gigli (2003) and Surviving Christmas (2004).[109] In 2003, the Wall Street Journal found that Affleck had an 82 percent recognition factor among members of the public, up from 75 percent the previous year. However, the percentage of people who don't like him also rose, from 12 percent to 18 percent.[110] In early 2004, Affleck remarked: "There is a real downside to having a barrage of personal publicity out there. It just makes it that much harder for people to forget all that when they're watching a movie ... I've come to a crossroads. For a long time, I wanted to prove some success to somebody, or I was afraid everything would go away.."[111] He then took a two-year break because "I was a little bit exhausted of myself and my life, so I wanted to try to control it or manage it."[112] However, he has also stated that his transformation has been overstated: "I definitely reject the narrative that says, you know, Bad Guy Turns It Around. My life isn't Behind the Music. I wasn't a criminal!"[113]
Along with Damon and producers Chris Moore and Sean Bailey, Affleck founded the production company LivePlanet, through which the four created the documentary series Project Greenlight, as well as the failed mystery-hybrid series Push, Nevada, among other projects.[114] Project Greenlight was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Reality Program in 2002, 2004, and 2005.[115][116]
Affleck starred in the critically acclaimed George Reeves noir biopic Hollywoodland, directed by HBO TV-series veteran Allen Coulter.[117] His performance was well-received; Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: "The irony is that Affleck's battering at the hands of fame has prepped him beautifully to play Reeves. He knows this character from the inside: the surface charm, the hidden vulnerability, the ache of watching a career become a joke and being helpless to stop it."[118] Claudia Puig wrote in USA Today that Affleck gives a "strong performance".[119] He was awarded the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival, won the Supporting Actor of the Year award at the Hollywood Film Festival,[120] and was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture.[121] Following the success of Hollywoodland, he appeared in the action film Smokin' Aces (2007), playing Jack Dupree, a bounty hunter.[122] Smokin' Aces received mixed reviews from critics[123] and was a box-office failure.[93]
Also in 2007, Affleck made his feature film directorial debut with Gone Baby Gone, for which he also co‑wrote the screenplay based on the book by Dennis Lehane about two Boston-area detectives investigating a little girl's kidnapping and how it affects their lives.[124] He began writing the screenplay in 2003.[125] His brother Casey starred in the film.[126] It opened to rave reviews in October 2007.[127] When asked why he decided to direct the film, Affleck said: "Directing a movie was really instructive for me. I think I learned a lot about writing, and a lot about acting, and I learned how all the pieces fit together from the inside. That was really valuable. It was a good thing."[128] The film received critical acclaim.[129] In Entertainment Weekly Lisa Schwarzbaum noted that Affleck "shows excellent instincts" as a director.[130] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com wrote: "As a director, Ben Affleck may turn out to be quite good with actors...But he may need to work harder at shaping material, and at making his characters emerge as rounded, believable people."[131]
Affleck appeared in Jimmy Kimmel's 2008 video I'm Fucking Ben Affleck, a response to a video by Kimmel's girlfriend, Sarah Silverman, I'm Fucking Matt Damon.[132][133] Many other celebrities appeared in the video including Good Charlotte's Joel and Benji Madden, Macy Gray, Dominic Monaghan, Lance Bass, Josh Groban, Don Cheadle, Brad Pitt, Cameron Diaz, Robin Williams, Harrison Ford, Huey Lewis, Joan Jett, Pete Wentz, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Meat Loaf, Dicky Barrett and others.[133]
In 2009, Affleck returned to acting, starring in three features, He's Just Not That Into You, State of Play, and Extract. In He's Just Not That Into You, a romantic comedy, he was part of an ensemble cast that included Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore, Scarlett Johansson, Bradley Cooper, Justin Long, and Jennifer Connelly.[134] The film generated mostly mixed reviews,[135] but was a box-office success, earning $165 million worldwide.[93]
In State of Play, an adaptation of the British television serial State of Play, Affleck played Congressman Stephen Collins. The film is a political thriller which explores the relationship between politicians and the media.[136] In the comedy film Extract, Affleck played Dean, a bartender, and the best friend to Jason Bateman's character.[137] His performance in the film was well-received, with Barbara Vancheri of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reporting that "Affleck is a hoot as a long-haired fount of bad advice and drugs he keeps in a little tin behind the bar. After playing a square-jawed crimefighter, an actor turned Superman and a congressman, he is actually loose and funny."[138]
Affleck directed his second feature, The Town, an adaptation of Chuck Hogan's novel Prince of Thieves, that was both a critical and commercial success when it was released in theaters in 2010.[139] Along with directing and co-writing the film, he was part of the cast that included Jon Hamm, Jeremy Renner, Chris Cooper and Blake Lively.
Affleck was awarded the Chairman's Award in the 2011 Palm Springs International Film Festival. Commenting on Affleck, Festival Chairman Harold Matzner said:[140]
If there is truly a renaissance man in today's cinema, it's Ben Affleck. He has distinguished himself as a premier writer and director, as well as an actor with a broad-ranging and impressive filmography. In his latest work, The Town, Affleck once again puts his acting, writing and directorial skills to work, in a stinging portrait of a New England town and the grip it has on generation after generation, who find it impossible to leave. For his ability to "do it all" and constantly evolve as an artist, The Palm Springs International Film Festival is proud to present Ben Affleck with the 2011 Chairman's Award.
Affleck starred alongside Olga Kurylenko, Javier Bardem, Rachel McAdams, and Rachel Weisz in To the Wonder, a romantic drama written and directed by Terrence Malick. Filming took place in fall 2010 in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, and Pawhuska, Oklahoma,[141] and the film was released in cinemas in 2013.
Affleck also directed his third feature, Argo, for producers George Clooney and Grant Heslov. The film tells the story of a CIA operation to save six diplomats during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis by faking a production for a large-scale science fiction film.[142]
Also with Argo, Affleck is the first director ever who failed to earn an Oscar nomination for Best Director, yet went on to win both the Golden Globe and the Directors Guild of America awards for best directing, in 2013.[143] For the same film, Affleck has also won the Critic's Choice and BAFTA awards for best director, while the film has been named Best Picture in the previously mentioned organizations as well as the Producers Guild.[144][145][146][147] In 2013, he received an honorary doctorate from Brown University.[148]
Affleck will star in David Fincher's adaptation of Gone Girl in 2014.[149] He will play Batman in the 2016 Man of Steel sequel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.[150] Affleck has said that while he respects fans' "strongly held opinions", "I don’t think projections about something that hasn’t happened yet are all that meaningful."[149] Following Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Affleck will begin filming his next directorial feature, an adaptation of the Dennis Lehane novel Live By Night.[151][152] The film will be released in 2016.[153]
Affleck is a philanthropist. Affleck's support of the non-profit charitable organization the A-T Children's Project,[154] began while he was filming Forces of Nature.[90][117] Affleck met a then nine-year-old child, Joe Kindregan, who has the rare disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T).[90][117] The disease, described as like having muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, immune deficiency and cancer all at once, is progressive; children with A-T usually do not live beyond their late teens.[90][117] Affleck attends benefits and spoke to Congress to advocate for the charity,[90][117] and in 2007 was the keynote speaker at the graduation ceremony of Falls Church High School in Fairfax, Virginia, from which Kindregan was graduating.[155] He is also involved with Feeding America and Paralyzed Veterans of America.[156]
In June 2008 he appeared in an ABC News exclusive report exploring the humanitarian crisis in the Eastern Congo. Affleck travelled to the African nation and interviewed refugees, warlords, and members of parliament. "I think the more painful something is, the more you want to distance yourself from it," he said. "I think the hard part is actually to let some of that go and to realize that when you see some of these images of people suffering in some way or another, to kind of remember that these are people who are in fact just in different circumstances than you are, but that are kind of dealing with [those circumstances] in a pretty brave and enduring way."[157] In December 2008, he teamed up with the United Nations releasing a short film highlighting the plight of Congolese refugees,[158][159] and, in 2009, wrote an essay for Time on the issue.[160] In March 2010, Affleck announced the formation of the Eastern Congo Initiative, which he founded as "the first U.S.-based advocacy and grant-making initiative wholly focused on working with and for the people of eastern Congo".[161] He visited the region again in 2012.[162] In April 2013, Affleck announced that he would take part in Global Poverty Project's "Live Below the Line" campaign, which consists of living on $1.50 a day to raise awareness of extreme poverty around the world.[163][164]
Affleck attended a screening of Good Will Hunting at Camp David with Bill and Hillary Clinton.[20] In the final weeks of the 2000 Presidential campaign, Affleck promoted the Democratic ticket, supporting Al Gore and repeatedly delivering a get-out-the-vote plea: "It's very important to vote. The president will appoint three or four Supreme Court justices."[165] During the final week of the race, Affleck—along with Helen Hunt, Martin Sheen, Rob Reiner and other actors—spent an hour at a phone bank calling registered Democrats.[166] "People in my generation have a low voter turnout. One of the reasons that I'm here is to demonstrate that no matter who you are going to vote for ...I think it's important to get involved and get out and vote," he told reporters. "But I'm going to tell people to vote for Gore."[165] On October 28, 2000, Affleck flew with Hillary Clinton, who was running for a Senate seat, to Ithaca, New York, where he introduced her at a Cornell University rally. He told the college crowd that Clinton had been advocating for women and working families since "Rick Lazio was running around the frat house in his underwear". Lazio, then a Long Island congressman, was Clinton's Republican opponent.[167]
On November 6, 2000, the final day of the campaign, Affleck was one of several high-profile celebrities summoned to Miami Beach by Miramax Films boss Harvey Weinstein for a late-night Gore rally, just hours before polls opened nationwide.[165] The Gore campaign's last event, a final effort to energize South Beach voters, did not end until about 1:00 am, but Affleck flew back to New York that morning and made a surprise live appearance on The Rosie O'Donnell Show. It was 10:15 am when he made his final public pitch from a Rockefeller Center studio, noting that he was "a little bit tired ... I've been out getting involved, doing stuff and trying to get people to vote. And that's why I came by here". Also, "Today is the get-out-the-vote day and ... I think this is the time to get involved, especially the young folks who are here ... I'm about to go vote," He then said, "I am personally gonna vote for Al Gore".[165] As votes were tallied that night, Affleck told Salon.com's Amy Reiter, "I'm nervous this evening, but one of the things that's exciting to me is the number of people who voted. No matter who wins, I think it's a healthy thing for our country that so many voters have come out and participated in the process. Either way, I think the most important number will be the turnout".[168]
In the May 2001 issue of GQ, Affleck said, "My fantasy is that someday I'm independently wealthy enough that I'm not beholden to anybody, so I can run for Congress on the grounds that everyday people should be in government".[169] However, when he was asked about his political ambitions in an April 2009 interview to promote the 2009 film, State of Play, Affleck said, "I really like my job that I have now. Plus, unlike in Hollywood where you need one director to hire you, in politics you have to have a lot of people to vote for you. I think it's harder work. I really am happy with what I'm doing now. In fact I've never been at a place where I've felt better about going to work everyday. I'm more engaged and very, very happy."[170] In 2002, he supported former classmate Marjorie Decker in her bid as a Democratic city councillor in Massachusetts[171] and campaigned with New York Sen. Charles Schumer to toughen nuclear security.[47] In 2003, he visited troops in the Persian Gulf.[172]
In 2004, Affleck actively campaigned for Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry.[173] During the first day of the 2004 Democratic National Convention, he was featured on Larry King Live with Tucker Carlson and Al Sharpton.[174] Larry King asked if he would consider running for office, and Affleck admitted to contemplating the proposition. Specific attention focused on whether he would run for Kerry's open Senate seat (as Affleck was from Massachusetts). He noted that the line between politics and entertainment is becoming increasingly blurred, as Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger both came from the entertainment business.[175] Also in 2004, he campaigned with Ted Kennedy to push for an increase in the minimum wage.[176][47] He attended the White House Correspondent's Dinner.[177] Also that year, he spoke out in support of gay marriage.[178]
Affleck supports legalizing gay marriage, saying in 2004, "I don't think the government should be involved in any way in people's bedrooms or lives. With so much hatred and unpleasantness in the world, why would you want to get in the way of people who love each other marrying each other? Anybody who wants to be able to get married to anybody else should be able to. It's not my business."[179] He also appeared in a print advertisement with his openly gay cousin in support of Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays.[180]
Despite his opposition to George W. Bush's policies as president, in an interview with Bill O'Reilly in July 2004 Affleck said, "I had the pleasure of and the honor of meeting the President of the United States at the Daytona 500. I found him to be a collegial, affable, kind guy." He went on to say Bush "is a patriot and he's a man who believes in the country. He's trying to further an agenda he believes in. I happen to disagree with most of his policies, but I respect the man."[181] In 2005, he supported the campaign of Massachusetts gubernatorial candidate Deval Patric.[182] In 2006, he supported then-Senator Barack Obama at a rally, introducing him as "the most galvanizing leader to come out of either party, in my opinion, in at least a decade."[183] In 2007, he appeared in global warming awareness clips produced by the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Center for American Progress Action Fund.[184] In 2007, he filmed an appearance in a nonpartisan campaign launched by the AARP seeking affordable, quality health care in America.[185] During the 2008 Democratic Convention, Affleck supported Second Harvest.[186] He developed a friendship with Anthony Weiner in 2008, meeting repeatedly, over dinner in Washington and New York, in preparation for his role as a politician in State of Play.[187]
Following the death of Howard Zinn, Affleck described him as "one of the great voices in the American political life ... I was lucky enough to know him personally, and I will carry with me what I learned from him - and try to impart it to my own children - in his memory."[188] On December 21, 2010, Affleck appeared on NPR and criticized CEOs for making so much money. "CEOs' pay shouldn't be 200 times the average worker. It used to be nine times."[189] On March 14, 2012, Affleck wrote an article endorsing the Kony 2012 campaign.[190] Affleck applauded the action taken by the Invisible Children in regards to raising awareness about child soldiers in Africa as well as raising awareness about the LRA. However, Affleck stated that "Westerners are not and will never be the 'saviors' of Africa".[191] In 2012, Affleck spoke alongside Hillary Clinton at Georgetown University as part of the child survival initiative. Clinton said of him: "I've known this young man for a long time and I have watched him start his own family with three beautiful children and a wife that makes it all work. I have enjoyed him in person, I have enjoyed him on the screen, but I particularly admire his commitment."[192]
On 12 March 2013, Affleck was officially censured by the parliament of New Zealand for misportraying the role of New Zealand diplomats during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis in his film Argo.[193] On 26 February 2014, Affleck was set to appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to discuss the mass killings of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Affleck is criticized for not having a "qualified resume" to take part in such activities–his only experience consisting of his philanthropic organization, the Eastern Congo Initiative. One aide at the House Foreign Affairs Committee claimed "People serious about resolving problems - especially problems related to life and death - want to have serious conversations with experts and leaders in the field; not celebrities." In response, to defend Affleck, another aide state "I think there's value in having someone like Ben there, he's pretty invested in the issue."[194][195][196]
Affleck is married to actress Jennifer Garner. They began dating in mid-2004, after co-starring in Daredevil together.[197][198][199][200] They became engaged in April 2005 and were married on June 29, 2005 in a low-key Turks and Caicos ceremony. Victor Garber, who officiated the ceremony, was the only guest.[201][202][197][117][203] The couple have three children: daughters Violet Anne (b. December 2005)[204] and Seraphina Rose Elizabeth (b. January 2009),[205] and son Samuel Garner (b. February 2012).[206][207] They have year-round homes in Los Angeles and Massachusetts, and an apartment in New York. The family own an 83-acre estate on the secluded Hampton Island near Savannah, Georgia. Affleck purchased the Greek Revival vacation home in 2003 for $7 million,[208][209][210][211][212] after filming Forces of Nature in the area.[178]
Affleck previously had high-profile relationships with actress Gwyneth Paltrow and actress/singer Jennifer Lopez. He met Paltrow at the premiere of Good Will Hunting in 1997.[90] They dated from October 1997 to January 1999.[20] During their breakup, Paltrow persuaded Affleck to co-star with her in Bounce.[213] In November 1999, after Bounce wrapped, they became a couple again but separated for good in October 2000.[214] Their split was amicable.[215] Paltrow later said that Affleck "makes life tough for himself. He's got a lot of complication, and you know, he really is a great guy."[216] Affleck responded: "She's probably right about that. I trust her opinion about most things. Not all, but most. I think I probably do get in my own way."[217]
In late 2001 Affleck began dating Lopez, whom he had met while filming Gigli.[218][219][117] They became engaged in November 2002,[220] and the relationship between the two received much attention from the entertainment media, who dubbed the couple "Bennifer".[117] Their planned wedding on September 14, 2003 in Santa Barbara, California was postponed with four days notice because of press leaks and the resulting "excessive media attention".[221] In December 2003, Affleck said that they were trying to be more low-profile.[222][172] The couple broke up in January 2004.[223] The couple remain on good terms.[224] Affleck has said that, while he has made plenty of mistakes in life, "I just don't view that as one of them."[225][226] "The temptation is to say that I wouldn't have done any of the press we did for Gigli, but you're paid really well to do these movies, and the expectation is that you're going to support them."[227] In 2013, Affleck said he and Lopez occasionally "touch base" via email: "I respect her. I like her."[228]
Affleck remains close friends with Matt Damon, remarking in 2014: "Having a friend you've been connected to since you were a little kid, that's grounding. Matt and my brother Casey are the two people I rely on the most, emotionally and professionally."[30] They live near each other in Los Angeles since 2012, with Affleck commenting, "I've been hounding him and hounding him to live here so our kids can know each other and go to the same schools and hang out the way we did and finally he caved."[40][229]
An avid poker player, Affleck has regularly entered local events. He has been tutored by poker professionals Amir Vahedi and Annie Duke. Duke has said Affleck "has the talent to become a fixture but not the time or inclination."[230] He appeared on Celebrity Poker Showdown in 2003. He won the California State Poker Championship on June 20, 2004, taking home the first prize of $356,000, which qualified him for the 2004 World Poker Tour final tournament.[231] In 2014, he was banned from playing blackjack at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas, after a series of wins aroused suspicion that he was counting cards. The gambling strategy is frowned upon by casinos.[232] He is a fan of the Boston Red Sox,[233] New England Patriots,[234] Boston Celtics,[235] and Boston Bruins.[236]
Affleck entered alcohol rehab in 2001, with a spokesman for the actor saying that "Ben is a self-aware and smart man who had decided that a fuller life awaits him without alcohol".[237] Affleck later described the decision as a "pre-emptive strike" given his family's history of alcoholism: "I just didn’t want it to get to that point."[238] While there have occasionally been tabloid headlines about Affleck's gambling, he doesn't feel "that it's a big issue for me," enjoying as he does its "psychological aspects," rather than the potential payoff. "People think, This is a person who's prone to being swept up in bad behaviour.' Just because I don't drink, I don't live in a convent."[111] He has spoken out against the assumption that, "If you're associated with [an addiction], you must have other problems, too. It's not, "Here's a sensible guy who wants his life to go in a certain direction, so he cuts the problem off at the pass so he can have a good life. He's someone who has a pretty good watch on himself. Instead it's seen as 'This guy's crazy.'"[227]
He was named Sexiest Man Alive by People Magazine in 2002.[47] Affleck has described himself as a lapsed Protestant.[239] In 2007, he said he considered his faith a "private matter", but chose the Book of Matthew as one of the books that made a difference in his life.[164]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Benjamin Geza Affleck was born on August 15, 1972 in Berkeley, California, USA, and was raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. His father, Tim Affleck, is a social worker, and his mother, Chris Affleck (née Boldt), is a school teacher; the two are now divorced. Ben also has a younger brother, actor Casey Affleck, who was born in 1975. Ben wanted to be an actor ever since he could remember and his first acting experience was for a Burger King commercial, when he was on the PBS mini-series The Voyage of the Mimi (1984). It was also at that age when Ben met his lifelong friend and fellow actor, Matt Damon. They played little league together and took drama classes together. Ben's teen years consisted of mainly TV movies and small television appearances including Hands of a Stranger (1987) and The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988). He made his big introduction into feature films in 1993 when he was cast in Dazed and Confused (1993). After that, he did mostly independent films like Kevin Smith's Mallrats (1995) and Chasing Amy (1997) which were great for Ben's career, receiving renowned appreciation for his works at the Sundance film festival. But the success he was having in independent films didn't last much longer and things got a little shaky for Ben. He was living in an apartment with his brother Casey and friend Matt, getting tired of being turned down for the big roles in films and being given the forgettable supporting ones. Since Matt was having the same trouble, they decided to write their own script, where they could call all the shots. So, after finishing the script for Good Will Hunting (1997), they gave it to their agent Patrick Whitesell, who showed it to a few Hollywood studios, finally being accepted by Castlerock. It was great news for the two but Castlerock wasn't willing to give Ben and Matt the control over the project they were hoping for. It was friend Kevin Smith who took it to the head of Miramax who bought the script giving Ben and Matt the control they wanted and, in December of 1997, Good Will Hunting (1997) was released, making the two unknown actors famous. The film was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and won two, including Best Original Screenplay for Ben and Matt. The film marked Ben's breakthrough role, in which he was given for the first time the chance to choose roles instead of having to go through grueling auditions constantly. He chose such roles in the blockbusters Armageddon (1998), Shakespeare in Love (1998) and Pearl Harbor (2001). With these hits to his credit, Hollywood can't seem to get enough of Ben, with directors wanting him in their movies and companies wanting his screenplays. His inspirational story of hard work and amazing climb to the top has brought him what he deserves and Ben Affleck has shown no sign of slowing down.
      He was accidently knocked unconscious by football player Dana Stubblefield during the filming of Reindeer Games (2000). Stubblefield slipped, and Affleck was knocked down. He was taken to the hospital, but fully recovered.
      When he was little, he asked his mom for a dog, and she tested him by making him walk an imaginary dog for a week. Ben only lasted for 5 days and didn't get the dog.
      Is known for being a very good impressionist. He usually picks one of his costars while filming a movie and studies them. He displays his impressions on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992) almost every time he is a guest. While filming The Sum of All Fears (2002), he chose to study co-star Morgan Freeman. When he showed Morgan his impression on set, it was so accurate Freeman told him, "You ever do that again, I'll kill you".
      Confirms engagement to Jennifer Lopez, after giving her a reported $3.5 million ring. (Nov. 2002)
      His ancestry includes English, Irish, German, Scottish, Northern Irish (Scots-Irish), French, and Swedish. His maternal great-grandfather, Joseph Raymond Boldt, was born in Rhode Island, to German immigrants.
      Voluntarily entered Promises Rehabilitation Center in Malibu, California for alcohol abuse. [July 2001]
      He was inspired to contribute to the Neil Bogart Memorial Fund, which supports cancer research at Los Angeles Children's Hospital, after meeting Molly Hanna, who died of cancer in 2002. She was a student in his mother's fifth-grade class.
      Growing up, the Marvel Comic book character Daredevil was his hero. He got to play the character in the 2003 movie.
      With the exception of Clerks. (1994), he has appeared in all of Kevin Smith's View Askewniverse films.
      He won $356,000 by winning the California State Poker Championships in June 2004 - defeating some of the best poker players in the world in the process.
      Is a first-time uncle to younger brother Casey's son, Indiana August, who was born on May 31, 2004 in Amsterdam, to Casey and his fiancé, actress Summer Phoenix.
      In 2001, was filming four movies simultaneously: Pearl Harbor (2001), Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001), Changing Lanes (2002), and The Sum of All Fears (2002).
      In 1999, he was nominated for the Razzie Award, Worst Screen Couple in the movie Armageddon (1998), with actress Liv Tyler. In 2004, he was again nominated for, and subsequently "won", the Worst Screen Couple Award with co-star Jennifer Lopez in the movie Gigli (2003). One year later (2005), he was nominated, once again, for Worst Screen Couple, this time with both of the actresses (Jennifer Lopez or Liv Tyler) in the film Jersey Girl (2004).
      As of 2005, has a total of seven Razzie Nominations (including three for Worst Actor) and two "wins".
      Had four different stunt men for Daredevil (2003), each one with a different specialty (fighting, wire works, etc.). He tried to do as much of his own stunts as he possibly could, feeling that it would add more credibility to the film.
      Appeared with wife Jennifer Garner in two movies Daredevil (2003) and Pearl Harbor (2001). It would have been three, but Affleck's small scene in Elektra (2005), was cut from the final film.
Tom Clancy wrote a script for a new Jack Ryan film entitled "Red Rabbit", with him in mind. "Red Rabbit" is set in the early 1980s, (when Clancy's novel version of Ryan was about Affleck's age) and chronicles a Soviet plot to kill Pope John Paul II only a few years into his reign.
      At one point after Good Will Hunting (1997) was released, Affleck was writing a script with Matt Damon and his brother Casey Affleck. The plot concerned teenagers in a half way house. It is not clear if this script will ever be completed.
      Was to have cameos in two Kevin Smith produced movies but had to back out due to scheduling conflicts. The two movies were Vulgar (2000) and Big Helium Dog (1999).
      Besides being known as the title character in the Daredevil franchise, is also known as Superman in the George Reeves bio-pic "Hollywoodland".
      Winner of the 2006 Venice Film Festival's Volpi Cup for Best Actor for his role in "Hollywoodland".
      His father was at one time a janitor at Harvard University, the inspiration for Will Hunting's job at MIT in Good Will Hunting (1997).
      Turned down the part of Bobby Mercer in Four Brothers (2005), as he found the script to be "ultra-violent". The part eventually went to Mark Wahlberg.
      He and his wife, Jennifer Garner, both had movies open on January 26 2007: his was Smokin' Aces (2006) and hers was Catch and Release (2006).
      Was originally set to play "Don Haskins" in Glory Road (2006), but pulled out of the project due to scheduling conflicts.
      Since late 2007 he has made four separate trips to the Democratic Republic of Congo to bring attention to the plight of that country. [November 2008]
      (November 11, 2008) Attended the star-studded opening of Dubai's lavish Atlantis Palms resort. Guests were welcomed in style with a display of one million fireworks, said to be visible from space.
      He has an entry in Jean Tulard's "Dictionnaire du Cinéma/Les Acteurs", published in Paris in 2007 (pgs. 15/16).
      Has directed 3 actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Amy Ryan, Jeremy Renner, and Alan Arkin.
      At age 25, he was the youngest person ever to win an Oscar for 'Best Original Screenplay'. He went 15 years without another nomination until 2013, and won 'Best Picture' for Argo (2012).
      When he and best friend Matt Damon were struggling actors, they both shared a Boston bank account.
      The first director ever to win both the Golden Globe and the Directors Guild awards for Best Director after failing to earn an Oscar nomination for the same work, for Argo (2012).
      Since the Directors Guild started awarding its DGA award for Best Director in 1948, Affleck is only the third director to ever win this award while also failing to even be nominated for an Oscar as Best Director. The two other directors likewise snubbed by Academy voters were Ron Howard for Apollo 13 (1995) and Steven Spielberg for The Color Purple (1985).
      He is the tallest actor to play Bruce Wayne/Batman and is in fact an inch and half taller than the version seen in the comics who stands at six-feet two inches tall.
      He has played two comic book characters whose most famous story lines were written by Frank Miller: Batman and Daredevil.
      He is the third Academy-award winner to play the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman after George Clooney and Christian Bale. He and Clooney are both two-time Oscar winners, and won their second Oscar together as producers of Argo (2012). He is the first to have won before playing Batman.
      Became a father for the 1st time at age 33 when his wife Jennifer Garner gave birth to their daughter Violet Anne Affleck on December 1, 2005.
      Became a father for the 2nd time at age 36 when his wife Jennifer Garner gave birth to their daughter Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Affleck on January 6, 2009.
      Became a father for the 3rd time at age 39 when his wife Jennifer Garner gave birth to their son Samuel Garner Affleck on February 27, 2012.
      He has the distinction of being the only actor to wear both a Batman suit and Superman suit in two different films.
      Starred alongside Alec Baldwin in ''Pearl Harbor (2001)'' and once played him in a skit on ''Saturday Night Live''. In addition to both playing the part of Tom Clancy's character Jack Ryan, both men share the distinction of playing iconic golden age comic book characters who used fear and intimidation: Baldwin played the title role in ''The Shadow (1994)'' and Affleck plays Bruce Wayne/Batman.
      As of 2014, has appeared in four films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar: Field of Dreams (1989), Good Will Hunting (1997), Shakespeare in Love (1998) and Argo (2012), with the two latter winning in the category.
      He is one year and five months older than Christian Bale, making him the only actor to play Bruce Wayne/Batman older than his predecessor.
      [on the celebrity women the tabloids falsely link him to] Sometimes it's Britney Spears, and sometimes it's Carrie Fisher. I can't tell if I have a Lolita complex or an Oedipus complex.
      [on tabloid coverage of his life] It feels like being in a soap opera that you were unwittingly cast in and you have no choice about it. I get to watch my life like everyone else and think. "I can't believe they did that". And, for whatever reason, you become less special for movie audiences. It cheapens the brand if you want to look at it in a really crass sense. But I figure it has to go away at some point. Eventually someone will come along and have a sex tape or someone will play grab-ass with some kids and I'll be off page one.
      [answering a Chris Matthews question about why Hollywood actors sometimes presume to be sophisticated about politics] Everyone's entitled to express their political beliefs. I don't presume to tell anybody who to vote for. I am comfortable telling people what my opinions are. But you have to look also to the media, where you have a vast majority of the loudest and most influential political voices in America media from people who came from the entertainment world. You have Rush Limbaugh, was a radio disc jockey. Bill O'Reilly came from Inside Edition (1988). Michael Moore's a filmmaker. Al Franken was on Saturday Night Live (1975). The line is increasingly blurred between news and entertainment. Secondarily, the media's also shoving celebrities down our throats all the time. As a person, I'm much more interested in what an actor has to say about something substantial and important than who they're dating or what clothes they're wearing or some other asinine, insignificant aspect of their life.
      [when asked by Chris Matthews what he thought about Whoopi Goldberg's remarks at a John Kerry fund raiser that resulted in her being fired as a spokesman for SlimFast] I wasn't there. I went to the Los Angeles fund raiser. I wasn't in the one in New York. I think when you have somebody -- you know, if you did a rock concert that was a benefit and The Who played their music or The Rolling Stones, you'd expect to get, you know, "Satisfaction" or "My Generation." When you hire Whoopi Goldberg, you're going to get her brand of humor. And I think there is a fine line, and you have to be a little bit mindful. And I, for one, am not going to do any scatological jokes or puns about the president's last name on your show, mostly for that reason. But I also think I expect a different code of behavior maybe from comedians who have made a career with a certain kind of comedy than I do from, oh, say, the Vice President of the United States erring to Vice President [Dick Cheney, who told Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy to "Go fuck yourself" on the floor of the Senate], who used this vulgar language, you know, to a senator and was sort of unapologetic about it. So I think the Republicans hitting her [Whoopi] too hard for that is a little bit hypocritical.
      [to Dee Dee Myers, when asked how people react to his campaigning for candidates he supports] Well, I mean, to be perfectly honest, probably the most effective things that celebrities do for political candidates is raise money. You know, that's something that you can do. And unlike, say, fund-raisers sponsored by -- you know, engineered by insurance companies or oil companies, at least what you can say for celebrities is they're not expecting, you know, deregulation of their industry in return. So that's one of things that I'm, I've been able to do and to try to help them do it. Other than that, you know, I've lived this sort of strange, sometimes unpleasant, but mostly very lucky life that's involved lately a lot of media attention. And one of the things that feels good to me to do is to try to steer that in a direction of something more significant and at least be -- try to create some political dialogue. And that's satisfying. Some people react to me kindly, and others don't. That's sort of the nature of politics. [Myers follows up: "Do you think it's kind of a risk for your career as movie star to get in bed with one party?"] Unequivocally. Absolutely. And I think that's why, you know, actually, people say, Well, you see all these celebrities. To my mind, you see very, very few. Most feel like, and probably correctly so, that to be identified with one side of the ideological fence or other risks alienating a segment of your audience that may like your movies, may want to buy your tickets, and in fact, may make it more difficult for them to suspend their disbelief when they go see you in a movie because they have you closely identified with something else. For me, part of that is already compromised, and it's also something that's interesting enough for me, and I don't care quite so much about that kind of image that I'm able to do it. But I think a lot of people shy away from it, and many celebrities you see who've gone out there, tried to be active, have gotten pretty beaten down, you know? And so I think there is a risk, yes. [July 27, 2004, quoted in the MSNBC Transcripts]
      [told by David Gergen that many were surprised by how well he "elucidated"] Well, David, I think I benefit from the same thing that helped George W. Bush in the [2000] debates, which is tremendously low expectations.
      [when asked why he thought George W. Bush, after hearing that New York was under attack on Sept 11, remained in a Florida classroom, doing nothing, for several minutes] It's obviously very disturbing footage. On the one hand, you see a reaction on a man's face that he is clearly pained and shocked. I probably did the same thing sitting on my chair. I was completely freaked out and a little devastated. On the other hand, one does hope that in one's leaders, that they have the instinct to spring into action, to take some action or make the appearance of taking some action. And I was disappointed to see that he didn't do that, although I don't entirely hold it against him because, frankly, I was as shocked and devastated as he was. Although I think flying around in Air Force One for 11 hours before coming back and landing in the White House was probably less forgivable.
      When I got to L.A., my family had me go to dinner with this guy who had been acting here for 20 years. He gave me this big lecture and said, "You know how much money I made in 20 years of acting? Eight thousand dollars. And I'm a carpenter." He was just really unhappy and it was depressing. Then he got really stoned and I went home and felt sick. I think it was just morbid fear. I was 18. That fear stays with you so intensely and you're constantly just getting turned down for what you think of as the most vapid, stupid kind of paycheck, Baywatch (1989) things, and you think, "Jesus, if I'm not good enough for this, then I'm not going to make it". This town is too hard, and people were always telling me, "You're too big, you're too tall, you can only play bullies and you will never be a leading man.
      [on his struggles as an actor before becoming successful] I lived all over the place. I lived in Hollywood, then I moved. [Matt Damon] and I got money from School Ties (1992), and we blew it all in a couple of months. We made $35,000 or $40,000 each and thought we were rich. And we were shocked later on to find out how much we owed in taxes. We were appalled: $15,000! What? But we rented this house on the beach in Venice and 800 people came and stayed with us and got drunk. Then we ran out of money and had to get an apartment. It was like everything was exciting. So we lived in Glendale and Eagle Rock and we lived in Hollywood, West Hollywood, Venice, by the Hollywood Bowl, all over the place. We'd get thrown out of some places or we'd have to upgrade or downgrade depending on who had money.
      It's like Christmas: it's all advertising, and the first rule of selling somebody something is to make them seem inadequate. Make them feel like they need it. Like fabric softener. Nobody really needs fabric softener and yet, all of a sudden, you feel like a jackass if you don't have fabric softener, so people buy it. And that's how Christmas has become, because 50% of all retail sales happen in December. You are bombarded with this stuff - money will make you happy, and keeping up with the Joneses. Obviously that stuff doesn't make you happy, otherwise there wouldn't be all these unhappy rich people. They'd all be happy in their jacuzzis and OK, some of them are.
      God help me if I ever do another movie with an explosion in it. If you see me in a movie where stuff is exploding you'll know I've lost all my money.
      Sure, I suffered a lot. But it's not like the end of the world and it's not who I am. I lead quite a pleasant life and I'm able to divorce a perceived reality from my actual experience of life.
      [on his career path and choice of movies] I have definitely noticed that I care less about certain things. Other actors are like, "You can't do that", or "You can't do this. This will position you in the wrong way." That's not my thing. And obviously so, because you can see I don't craft or cultivate my career.
      I've finally learnt how to say, "No comment". To appear in the tabloids is a real learning curve and a steep one at that. You had better learn quick or you get burnt.
      [about the New York Yankees' principal owner] You know George M. Steinbrenner III is the center of all evil in the universe.
      I'm not known for having great relationships with ex-girlfriends, but I've been able to continue one with [Gwyneth Paltrow] that's really valuable.
      I'm always described as "cocksure" or "with a swagger", and that bears no resemblance to who I feel like inside. I feel plagued by insecurity.
      I remember back when I was a kid there was a comic strip called Plastic Man. His body was elastic and he could make his extremities as long as he wanted. As a youngster I didn't fully appreciate. But I'm now thinking Plastic Man was probably pretty popular with the ladies.
      I hate the whole reluctant sex-symbol thing. It's such bull. You see these dudes greased up, in their underwear, talking about how they don't want to be a sex symbol.
      I kinda see my current position like this: "Here's your five minutes in the toy store, so you gotta do all the good movies you can before Chuck Woolery rings the bell".
      When I look up at the screen and see myself I always have to laugh. Not because I think I'm doing a horrible job, quite the contrary, I just feel it's so surreal to feel like one person can entertain so many at one time.
      I just feel like sometimes I'm a force to be dealt with. My talents are sometimes overused and also sometimes underused. It's not easy being me.
      I never know what my next move will be in Hollywood. It's such an unpredictable town. People get jaded and lost and I've been able to stay a float. I think the next logical step in my career would be to start my own filmmaking empire like [Harvey Weinstein] and [Bob Weinstein] did so many years ago. I think if only the unions weren't so strict in Boston, I'd set up shop there and make films of a certain quality you don't see represented these days. I'm full of ideas and dreams.
      [asked by Dee Dee Myers if he thought it was risky for his career to be identified with a particular political party] Unequivocally. Absolutely. And I think that's why, you know, actually, people say, "Well, you see all these celebrities". To my mind, you see very, very few. Most feel like, and probably correctly so, that to be identified with one side of the ideological fence or other risks alienating a segment of your audience that may like your movies, may want to buy your tickets, and in fact, may make it more difficult for them to suspend their disbelief when they go see you in a movie because they have you closely identified with something else. For me, part of that is already compromised, and it's also something that's interesting enough for me, and I don't care quite so much about that kind of image that I'm able to do it. But I think a lot of people shy away from it, and many celebrities you see who've gone out there, tried to be active, have gotten pretty beaten down, you know? And so I think there is a risk, yes.
      I think we don't need to know anything about a political figure's sex lives. I guess Matt Drudge did break [the Monica Lewinsky] story, if you think that's a story worth breaking. I think it was a story that bogged down the wheels of government for two years. I don't care, personally. Some people say that's a fair reflection of a candidate's character. I don't. I'm not voting for your sexual predilection, I'm voting for your policy positions.
      Newspapers have gotten lazy and gotten nervous and started sourcing from blogs, and that, I think, is dangerous. Because you could pick any blog. I could start a blog tomorrow and write, 'I heard that so-and-so is an alien' -- a lot of false stories got started and got some currency because they were placed in blogs.
      Part of the blogging culture that's good is it's made the traditional press much more nervous. They've become more accountable, because they are sensitive to what the bloggers are going to say. Most Americans don't spend the day waiting for what the bloggers are going to say. The mainstream media sweats it, because for the first time they are actually accountable to someone who is going to write about them and their work. Which has a real strong impact on the mainstream media and how they work.
      I was no longer in control of my life. I thought I wanted certain things, but I didn't. I got lost. I felt suffocated, miserable and gross. I should never have gone down that route or got sucked in to all the publicity. I was typecast as myself. Too many people weren't getting past what they read about me. That was damaging. I can tell from experience it's bad for you, and bad for your career. So I took a break, went away for a while and let things calm down. (Claiming that his high-profile engagement with Jennifer Lopez damaged his career.)
      I finally decided to quit smoking when I found out I was going to have a child. That was the thing that sort of put it over the top for me. I decided to go to a hypnotist. You sit in a chair and the hypnotist sips water and just talks to you for an hour, and explains how nicotine is poison. All of a sudden, I thought, 'This is asinine that I've been doing this to myself for all these years.' My last cigarette was on November 10th, 2005, and I feel a huge difference in my health now that I don't smoke. I feel like I'm in better shape than I was five years ago.
      [on turning down the offer to direct Superman: Man of Steel (2013)] - The one benefit of having done all kinds of movies as an actor is, you learn the pros and cons of being tempted to do a really big movie because it costs a lot of money.With "Superman", I think they're going to do a great version. Christopher Nolan is brilliant and they've got a great director for it.... Also there are a lot of guys ahead of me on the list to do epic effects movies.
      I'd love to do [direct] something like Blade Runner (1982), but a lesson I've learned is to not look at movies based on budget, how much they'll spend on effects, or where they will shoot. Story is what's important.
      [on starting out as a film director] I knew how the sausage was made. Whether I could make a good sausage I didn't know. But I knew how to get into the sausage factory and stuff intestines.
      [on "Argo" and the relationship between Hollywood and the government] There is a symbiotic relationship. People make movies about military. When you go on a tour with the military all these guys are movie buffs. Movies are a big part of our culture. The military, the movies, and our intelligence services are inventing things. For movies, it's for art and entertainment. For intelligence services, it's for God knows what. That's one of the themes of this story: the power of storytelling, whether it's political theater, relating to our children, or trying to get people out of danger. Telling stories is incredibly powerful. There's a shot I really like where there's this firing squad, then you go to this read through, and then there's a firearm, a rifle, and a camera. Hopefully this is subtle, but that suggests the camera is more powerful than the gun. I think that's been really worn out with the Youtube era.
      [on life after 'Gigli' and 'Jersey Girl'] Unfortunately there's an aspect of (press coverage) that's like one of those fights you see on YouTube where one of them falls down and then a bunch of people, who were standing around, come over to kick the person. They don't know them, they have no involvement in the fight, but they recognize a moment that they can get a free shot in. And for some people it's just too much to resist. And that was definitely me at that point. I was the guy. I was the designated person to loathe.
      iewing his career, 2013] I was nobody auditioning, and then I was seen as this young, emerging talent, writer, Oscar-winner, and then I was seen as this blockbuster actor, and then I was seen as this train-wreck actor, and then I was seen as this resurgent director. And now I think I'm kind of seen as just sort of somebody in Hollywood who works.
      [on Roger Ebert's death] It just broke my heart that he had died. And the fact that his last review [of 'To the Wonder'] was through the prism of this wonderful man who was at the end of his life was one of the most powerful things to ever happen to me in my career.
      [his acceptance speech at the 2013's SAG Awards] I can't believe I'm standing in the place where Daniel Day-Lewis just was. Feel like I may be a better actor just for the radiation.
      [2013: Excerpt from the closing remarks of his Best Picture acceptance speech] I want to thank [The Academy] and I want to thank what they taught me, which is that you have to work harder than you think you possibly can. You can't hold grudges. It's hard but you can't hold grudges. And it doesn't matter how you get knocked down in life, because that's gonna happen. All that matters is that you gotta get up.
      Having a family makes things you have that much richer. It's much nicer to share it with the people you love.
      [on Enough Said (2013)] Nicole Holofcener's "Enough Said" is sublime. The performances and the direction are honest and restrained. She expertly coaxes the characters along through the story, and she manages to accomplish that rare feat: to make the performances so realistic you think it's a bunch of actors improvising as themselves, only to reveal a carefully constructed, interlocking story - woven expertly around profound themes. She has a graceful directorial touch. She makes space for her actors' success and seems to know precisely when they've achieved it. Her modesty as a director, her insistence not to step in front of the movie, at first serves to immerse us more fully into the film - and then pulls us from the feelings we didn't even know were there (and had been, no doubt, percolating on Ms. Holofcener's timetable all along). Her direction is void of spectacle, distraction or maudlin sentiment. She directs with the humanist, realist sensibility of Renoir, and like the great humanist films, "Enough Said" depicts our shared experience, illuminates the individual and celebrates what it means to be human.

After appearing in a Burger King ad, he lands the part of C.T. Granville on the PBS miniseries The Voyage of the Mimi. The 13-episode educational program follows the crew of the Mimi exploring the ocean.  "I was [a kid] when I did this science show," he tells Entertainment Weekly in 2007.

1997Let's Just Do ItAfter Damon's creative writing teacher at Harvard encourages him to hold on to the play version of Good Will Hunting he wrote for class, Damon brings it to L.A., not knowing what to do with it.  He shows it to Affleck: "[Affleck] took a look at it and he said, 'Well, we should really write this together,'" Damon recalls in an interview with Rough Cut Online. "So we just started writing this thing one night.  And it just tumbled out."

"A lot of it really hasn't sunk in," says Affleck, who also had to get used to his new popularity with female fans. "The pinup aspect is part of the game," the actor tells PEOPLE. "I think you're naïve if you want to be an actor and you don't expect that people will see you that way. Hey, young guys, pinup guys, that's what sells."

                According to People Magazine (and J-Lo of course), he is one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world. He's also a very fine actor and Oscar winning screenplay writeBenjamin Géza Affleck was born to actor-father Timothy Affleck, and mother Chris Boldt, a school teacher. Tim worked with big name stars such as Dustin Hoffman, and joined the Theatre Company Of Boston. It was therefore Tim’s influence and connections that got Affleck started in TV in the early years of his life. Affleck’s first strike for fame was appearing in adverts for Burger King and, by the age of 12, he had appeared in the educative mini-series 'The Voyage of the Mimi'. At this point in his life though, Affleck suffered an emotional setback when his parents divorced. The relationship break-up was blamed on Tim’s "severe, chronic problem with alcoholism". Tim left for the Recovery Centre in Palm Springs, got back on his feet, and today works as a drugs counsellor for people in rehabilitation. Significantly, it’s worth noting that at age 8, Affleck had met and befriended a boy called Matt Damon, and together they attended Little League and also acted. While at the Rindge and Latin High School, they were both members of a group who won a drama award from the Boston Globe and here their future ambitions were founded. But it was Damon who possessed the work-ethic and once he’d gained a place to Harvard, Affleck's school career began to slide. Affleck’s high B average wasn’t enough for entry to Harvard as well so he instead enrolled at the University of Vermont. Affleck soon decided to eschew his studies in favour of a more practical approach to job-winning by heading straight to Hollywood. Putting this plan to his mother, she agreed so long as he stayed with friends of hers and continued his studies at the Occidental College. Affleck submitted to his mother’s conditions and took up Middle Eastern Studies. Throughout the early 90s, Affleck’s career aspirations failed to alight. After appearing in an uncredited role as Basketball Player number 13 in the film version of 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer', there were a number of low-key TV series. So he took the decision to venture into the world of independent cinema instead. Affleck’s first film in 1992 was 'School Ties'. By this time, Matt Damon had left Harvard and joined him in LA and, despite debuting alongside Julia Roberts in 'Mystic Pizza', he too was finding the going tough. With offers still slow off the ground, Affleck took a part in Richard Linklater's classic 'Dazed And Confused' (1993), a brilliant comic study of Seventies teens, where Matthew McConaughey also made his debut. While Affleck’s move into independent film did manage to secure him a few roles, it also helped him establish vital contacts who would later contribute to his success.In 1995, Affleck appeared in Kevin Smith's 'Mallrats'. Smith was already renowned thanks to his underground hit film 'Clerks' (1994), and this new movie took the audience into the dark heart of the American mall, with Affleck playing the slick manager of Fashionably Male, seducing Shannon Doherty, to the despair of her would-be lover. Kevin Smith was so impressed that that he set about writing his next movie around Affleck - 'Chasing Amy' (1997), about a cartoonist (Affleck) who falls for a lesbian played by Joey Lauren Adams.  In 1996, Affleck landed a larger part in 'Glory Daze' but the film wasn’t a success. While studying at Harvard, Matt Damon had begun writing a story during one of his English classes, but had put the idea on hold for a year or so. Picking it up again, Damon decided to turn the tale into a screenplay and enlisted Affleck's help. They called the final edit 'Good Will Hunting', and at this time Affleck's connections proved their worth. He showed the script to Kevin Smith who loved it and took it straight to Harvey Weinstein at Miramax.  Before they knew it, Miramax had signed the film, Robin Williams came on board, as did director Gus Van Sant ('To Die For'), and Damon and Affleck found themselves $600,000 richer, and starring in their own screenplay. Good Will Hunting grossed over $130 million after its release in 1997 and won Affleck and Damon an Academy Award for Best Screenplay.  By the time of its release, the hype surrounding the duo was already immense leading to Damon taking the title role in 'Saving Private Ryan', and Affleck starring in the hit 'Armageddon' (1998), which grossed over $200 million. Soon the parts came flooding in. He starred once more with Damon in the cult-hit (and another Kevin Smith film) 'Dogma' (1999), played a ruthless dealer in 'The Boiler Room' (2000), and starred alongside Gary Sinise as an ex-con in 'Reindeer Games' (2000). After starring in 'Bounce' (2000) with Gwyneth Paltrow and Billy Bob Thornton's 'Daddy and Them' (2001), Affleck took his first major action role since Armageddon - 'Pearl Harbour', playing the romantic lead, opposite Kate Beckinsale in 2001. Pearl Harbour was panned by the critics though and for a while it seemed his career had ground to a sudden halt. 'Changing Lanes' (2002), thankfully was a surprise chart-topper once more. As was Affleck’s role in 'The Sum of All Fears' (2002), stepping into Harrison Ford’s shoes playing the character of Jack Ryan in the Tom Clancy series.'Daredevil' (2003), the latest in a string of super-hero movies, saw Affleck star as Matt Murdock, a man blinded by radioactive waste but still able, due to his other now-enhanced senses, to foil villains with his acrobatic stunts and ninja-type abilities. Co-incidentally, Kevin Smith had earlier written some of the Daredevil comics, and would appear in the movie as a laboratory assistant. Affleck’s role in the film 'Gigli' (2003) was to spark interest of another kind though- when he began a romance with his co-star, Jennifer Lopez. The media couldn’t get enough of the pair and Gigli was internationally torn apart - creating a new record in the US with a takings drop of 81.9% in its second weekend. Fans would lay blame of Affleck’s sudden fall from favour at Lopez’s door. An engagement between the two was announced, then called off in September 2003 with Affleck later describing the period of his life with Lopez as a “car wreck.” Affleck next appeared in John Woo's thriller 'Paycheck' (2003), before being reunited with Kevin Smith once more on 'Jersey Girl' in 2004, based on Smith's own experience of fatherhood. Jersey Girl unfortunately dragged old headlines out of the woodwork for Affleck as the film also starred Jennifer Lopez. He kept his head high though and simply let the ruckus burn itself out while he got on with life outside of film. Throughout 2005, Affleck was still a major attraction in the press, but only due to his relationship with actress Jennifer Garner, who'd earlier played Elektra to his Daredevil. Garner’s profile had been raised after Elektra and the TV show 'Alias' and Affleck once more found himself one half of a tabloid-friendly couple. He had learnt his lesson though and both shied away from the publicity. The couple married in June 2005 in a low-key ceremony and the birth of their daughter, Violet Anne, in December, was also announced quietly without the usual 10-page magazine spread.  2006 would see his attempt at a comeback, first making a brief cameo in mate Kevin Smith’s 'Clerks II'. But it was 'Hollywoodland', where Affleck plays George Reeves, a failed screen actor who found belated fame as Superman on TV, that Oscar rumours started to circulate again. Affleck’s performance was rated highly, winning him the Volpi Cup as Best Actor at Venice, and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role. At last, Affleck was back on the radar. With Affleck’s wages having risen from $20,000 for Danielle Steele's 'Daddy' in 1991 to tens of millions, it seems that Affleck’s success pact with Matt Damon many moons ago has finally paid off.Affleck made his directorial debut in 2007 with the movie 'Gone Baby Gone', which he also co-wrote. The film also starred Affleck's younger brother, Casey. The film was widely praised by critics when it opened in October of that year. Commenting on his decision to direct a film, he said: "Directing a movie was really instructive for me. I think I learned a lot about writing, and a lot about acting, and I learned how all the pieces fit together from the inside. That was really valuable. It was a good thing." In 2009, the actor returned in front of the cameras for the films 'He's Just Not That Into You', 'State of Play' and 'Extract'. The multi-talented Affleck directed his second film the following year. Entitled 'The Town', it is based on an adaptation of Chuck Hogan's 'Prince of Thieves' novel. Like 'Gone Baby Gone', the film was a commercial and critical success. Affleck's marriage to actress Jennifer Garner is still going strong, with the pair welcoming their second daughter Seraphina Elizabeth Rose into the world in January 2009.  In 2010, Affleck played one of the main roles in the film 'The Company Men', which features three men coping with the downsizing at a major company where they work and the impact this has on their families. He then directed and starred in 'The Town', which also featured Blake Lively, Rebecca Hall and Jon Hamm. It tells the story of a long-time thief planning his next bank job while balancing his feelings for the bank manager and an FBI agent determined to bring his gang down. Affleck will be playing the lead male role in an untitled Terence Malick production and starring in 'Argo', which is about the Iranian Revolution next year. The actor and his wife Garner will also be welcoming their third child early next year to join their two daughters. They announced Garner's pregnancy in August and stated they were "thrilled" with the news. A source close to the couple has also revealed that the pair have started thinking of names for their new arrival, with most of them stolen from their favourite Disney characters.

Tall and handsome in a meat-eating sort of way, Ben Affleck has the looks of a matinee idol and the resume of an actor who honed his craft as an indie film slacker before flexing his muscles as a Hollywood star. A staple of Kevin Smith films and such seminal indies as Dazed and Confused, Affleck became a star and entered the annals of Hollywood legend when he and best friend Matt Damon wrote and starred in Good Will Hunting, winning a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for their work.Born in Berkeley, California on August 15, 1972 to a schoolteacher mother and drug rehab counselor father, Affleck was the oldest of two brothers. His younger brother, Casey, also became an actor. When he was very young, Affleck's family moved to the Boston area, and it was there that he broke into acting. At the age of eight, he starred in PBS's marine biology-themed The Voyage of the Mimi, endearing himself to junior high school science classes everywhere. The same year he made Mimi, Affleck made the acquaintance of Matt Damon, a boy two years his senior who lived down the street. The two became best friends and, of course, eventual collaborators. After a fling with higher education at both the University of Vermont and California's Occidental College, Affleck set out for Hollywood. He began appearing in made-for-TV movies and had a small role in School Ties, a 1992 film that also featured Damon. Further bit work followed in Richard Linklater's Dazed and Confused (1993) and Kevin Smith's Mallrats (1995). Around this time, both Affleck and Damon were getting fed up with the lack of substantial work to be found in Hollywood, and they decided to write a screenplay that would feature them as the leads. Affleck's brother Casey introduced them to Gus Van Sant, who had directed Casey in To Die For. Thanks to Van Sant's interest, the script was picked up by Miramax, and in 1997 the story of a troubled mathematical genius living in South Boston became known as Good Will Hunting. Before the film's release, Affleck starred in Smith's Chasing Amy that same year; the tale of a comic book artist (Affleck) in love with a lesbian (Joey Lauren Adams), it received good reviews and showed Affleck to be a viable leading man. The subsequent success of Good Will Hunting and the Best Original Screenplay Oscar awarded to Affleck and Damon effectively transformed both young men from struggling actors into Hollywood golden boys. Having won his own Golden Boy, Affleck settled comfortably into a reputation as one of the industry's most promising young actors. His status was further enhanced by widespread media reports of an ongoing relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow. The following year, Affleck could be seen in no less than three major films, ranging from his self-mocking supporting role in the Oscar-winning period comedy Shakespeare in Love to the thriller Phantoms to the big-budget box-office monster Armageddon. In 1999, Affleck continued to keep busy, appearing in a dizzying four movies. He could be seen as a dull bartender in 200 Cigarettes, an errant groom in Forces of Nature, a stock market head hunter in The Boiler Room, and a supporting cast member in Billy Bob Thornton's sophomore directorial effort, Daddy and Them. Finally, Affleck reunited with Smith and Damon for Dogma, starring with the latter as a pair of fallen angels in one of the year's more controversial  films. In 2000, he would appear as an ex-con trying to mend his ways in Reindeer Games, with Charlize Theron.  Re-teaming with Armageddon cohort Michael Bay again in 2001 for another exercise in overbudgeted excess, Affleck flew into action in Pearl Harbor. Despite unanimous lambasting from critics, Pearl Harbor blasted to number one at the box office, earning $75.2 million on its Memorial Day weekend opening and beginning a summer-2001 trend of high profile films with precipitous box-office runs. Following a self-mocking return to the Smith collective in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001) and spearheading, along with Damon, the innovative HBO series Project: Greenlight, Affleck returned to the Hollywood machine with roles in Changing Lanes and The Sum of All Fears (both 2002). Filling the shoes of Harrison Ford as a green version of Ford's famous Jack Ryan persona, The Sum of All Fears contemplated a radical group's plan to detonate a nuclear weapon at a major sporting event during a time of particularly sensitive public distress at such an idea. With the massive success of Spider-Man in the summer of 2002 prompting numerous comic-book superhero revivals, Affleck would next suit up for the role of Daredevil. As a lawyer turned into a true public defender following a mishap involving radioactive waste, Daredevil's incredibly enhanced senses enable him to get the jump on New York City evil-doers and with his athletic physique and heroically protruding chin Affleck seemed just the man to suit-up for the job. If Affleck's turn as a blind crimefighter found dedicated comic book fans turning up their noses in disgust, the lukewarm performance of that particular effort would hardly compare to the critical lashing of his subsequent efforts Gigli, Paycheck, and Jersey Girl. A notorious flop that couldn't be mentioned to movie lovers without fear of derisive laughter, Gigli alone would have likely sunken the career of a lesser star. Though Hollywood gossip rags were indeed talking about Affleck, it was more the result of his turbulent relationship with singer and Gigli co-star Jennifer Lopez than it was anything to do with his acting career.  Just when it seemed that the ubiquitous "Ben and Jen" gossip that fueled the tabloids couldn't get more tiresome, the celebrity power-couple broke up their frequently discussed engagement to the surpirse of only the most optimistic ! Channel viewer. Wed to Alias star Jennifer Garner in 2005, Affleck subsequently skewered Hollywood materialism in the showbiz comedy Man About Town before making a cameo in pal Smith's eagerly-anticipated sequel Clerks II. By this point Affleck was certainly no stranger to Hollywood controversy, a fact that likely played well into his decision to strap on the famous red cape to portray original television Superman George Reeves in the 2006 Tinseltown mystery Hollywoodland.  As the 2000's rolled onward, Affleck would appear in a number of films that garnered a lukewarm reception, like Smokin' Aces, He's Just Not That Into You, and State of Play. He would reverse that trend with a vengeance in 2007, directing and writing  the critically acclaimed crime thriller Gone Baby Gone . He followed that up by directing and starring in The Town, and that film put Affleck squarely back into audiences' good graces. He immediately got to work on his next big project, working both behind and in front of the camera once again for the political thriller Argo which garnered strong reviews, solid box office, and a slew of year-end awards including Best Picture at the Academy Awards, even though Affleck was not nominated for Best Director. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi

Birth Name: Benjamin Geza AffleckBirth Place: Berkeley, CADate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 08/15/1972, LeoProfession: Actor; screenwriter; producer; director
Affleck is a talented actor, Oscar-winning screenwriter and promising director who shot to stardom in his twenties after a childhood acting career. In the '80s, the athletic actor appeared in a number of TV movies before making it to the big screen, notably as an anti-Semitic jock in the 1992 teen drama School Ties, costarring his future collaborator, Matt Damon. In 1995, he appeared in Mallrats, his first of many Kevin Smith comedies, but 1997 was Affleck's breakthrough year. First, he won raves as a comic-book artist in love with a lesbian in Smith's Chasing Amy. Then he and Damon cowrote and costarred in the drama Good Will Hunting, which earned the duo an Oscar for best original screenplay. He also began filming the Academy Award-winning Shakespeare in Love with Gwyneth Paltrow, with whom he had a much-publicized off-screen relationship. Over the next several years, Affleck took on leading roles in films of all genres---action (Armageddon), romantic comedy (Forces of Nature) and drama (Pearl Harbor)---but it was another tabloid-grabbing romance, this time with Jennifer Lopez, that gained the most notice. Dubbed "Bennifer," the couple were stalked by the paparazzi until 2004, when they finally called it quits after starring together in two poorly received movies (Gigli and Smith's Jersey Girl). However, Affleck was able to recycle the "Bennifer" moniker when he began dating his Daredevil (2003) costar, Jennifer Garner, that same year. The two married in 2005 and have two children. Affleck successfully branched out into directing with the critically acclaimed Gone Baby Gone (2007), which starred his younger brother, Casey. Then, after taking a couple years off from acting, Affleck returned full-force in 2009, starring in the romantic comedies He's Just Not That Into You and Extract and the political thriller State of Play.Ben Affleck Fast Facts:
