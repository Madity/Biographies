 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Milla Jovovich is an Ukrainian-born actress, supermodel, fashion designer, singer and public figure, who was on the cover of more than a hundred magazines, and starred in such films as The Fifth Element (1997), Ultraviolet (2006), and the Resident Evil (2002) franchise. She was born Milica Natasha Jovovich on December 17, 1975, in Kiev, Ukraine, Soviet Union (now Kiev, Ukraine). Her Serbian father, Bogdan Jovovich, was a medical doctor in Kiev. There he met her mother Galina Jovovich, a Russian actress. At the age of 5, in 1981, Milla with her parents emigrated from the Soviet Union, moving first to London, UK, then to Sacramento, California, and eventually settled in Los Angeles. There her parents worked as house cleaners for the household of director Brian De Palma. Her parents separated, and eventually divorced, because her father was arrested and spent several years in prison.Young Milla Jovovich was brought up by her single mother in Los Angeles. In addition to her native Russian, she also speaks Serbian and English. However, in spite of her cosmopolitan background, Milla was ostracized by some of her classmates, as a kid who emigrated from the Soviet Union amidst the paranoia of the Cold War. Many emotional scars had affected her behavior, but she eventually emerged as a resilient, multi-talented, albeit rebellious and risk-taking girl. She was coached by her actress mother since her childhood, first at home, then studied music, ballet, and acting in Los Angeles. In 1994, she appeared on the cover of 'High Times' in the UK, at the age of 18.She shot to international fame after she was spotted by the photographer Richard Avedon at the age of 11, and was featured in Revlon's "Most Unforgettable Women in the World" advertisements, and on the cover of the Italian fashion magazine 'Lei' which was her first cover shoot. She made her first professional model contract at the age of 12, and soon made it to the cover of 'The Face', 'Vogue', 'Cosmopolitan' and many other magazines. The total number of her magazine covers worldwide was over one hundred by 2004, and keeps counting. In 2004, she made $10.4 million, becoming the highest paid supermodel in the world.Milla Jovovich was torn between two professions, before she eventually became one of the very few supermodels who also developed a steady and serious film career. In 1988, at age 12, she made her film debut credited as Milla in a supporting role in Two Moon Junction (1988) by writer/director Zalman King. During the 1980s and early 1990s, she played several supporting roles as a teenage actress in film and on television, then starred in Return to the Blue Lagoon (1991). In 1997, she co-starred opposite Bruce Willis in the sci-fi blockbuster The Fifth Element (1997), then she starred as the title character of Joan of Arc (1999). In the early 2000s, Milla had a few years of uncertainty in her acting career due to uneven quality of her films, as well as some hectic events in her private life. However, she managed to overcome her personal crisis. With the leading role as Alice in Resident Evil (2002) and its sequels, she established herself as a film star, and her success in acting career eventually matched her success as a supermodel.Outside of her acting and modeling professions, Milla Jovovich released several critically acclaimed musical recordings, making her debut as a singer, songwriter and musician with the 1994 release of 'The Divine Comedy'. She also gave several live performances with her band Plastic Has Memory and was featured on 'Hollywood Goes Wild'. Her vocal recordings appeared on soundtracks of several films. She has been writing music and lyrics to her song-demos, playing her guitar and sampling other sounds from her computer, and allowing free download and remix of her songs from her website.For many years Milla Jovovich has been maintaining a healthier lifestyle, practicing yoga and meditation, trying to avoid junk food, and cooking for herself. Since she was a little girl, Milla has been writing a private diary, a habit she learned from her mother. She has been keeping a record of many good and bad facts of her life, her travels, her relationships, and all important ideas and events in her career, planning eventually to publish an autobiography. After dissolution of her two previous marriages, Milla Jovovich became engaged to film director Paul W.S. Anderson; their daughter, Ever Anderson, was born on November 3, 2007.
          Milla Jovovich was born in 1975 in Kiev, Ukraine, to a Serbian pediatrician and a renowned Russian actress. Her family moved to the U.S. in 1981 and she began her remarkable modeling career at age nine. At age 12, she was chosen by legendary photographer Richard Avedon as one of Revlon's "Most Unforgettable Women in the World" and has since appeared on over 150 magazine covers around the world. Milla appeared in ad campaigns for Chanel, Versace, Emporio Armani, Donna Karen, DKNY, Celine, P&K, H&H, and continues her role as the worldwide spokesmodel for L'Oreal. Thanks to their continued success with Milla, Giorgio Armani chose her to be the face of his fragrance, Night. In addition to Armani's fragrance, Milla was the face for Calvin Klein's Obsession and Christian Dior's Poison for over 10 years and has most recently become the new face for Donna Karan's Cashmere Mist fragrance, which debuts in August 2009. Milla continues to shoot with the fashion industry's most sought after photographers, including Peter Lindbergh, Mario Sorrenti, Craig McDean and Inez & Vinoodh.Milla made her acting debut in the Disney Channel movie The Night Train to Kathmandu (1988) and she made guest appearances on television series including Married with Children (1987) (in 1989 as a French exchange student), Paradise (1988) and Parker Lewis Can't Lose (1990) Her first feature film was Two Moon Junction (1988) with Sherilyn Fenn and starred in Return to the Blue Lagoon (1991) at age 15. She played opposite Christian Slater in Kuffs (1992) prior to appearing in Sir Richard Attenborough's critically-acclaimed Chaplin (1992), playing the silent screen legend's second wife, Mildred Harris, opposite Oscar nominee Robert Downey Jr.. Her film credits also include Richard Linklater's cult classic tale of 1970s high school slackers, Dazed and Confused (1993).Milla's breakthrough starring role in motion pictures came in Luc Besson's science fiction thriller, The Fifth Element (1997) opposite Bruce Willis. Her portrayal of a "perfect being" who holds the key to preventing evil from destroying the world won the hearts of fans and critics alike. She followed that success with a role as a prostitute in Spike Lee's He Got Game (1998) with Denzel Washington. Next, Milla followed in the footsteps of such screen legends as Ingrid Bergman and Jean Seberg to achieve critical acclaim as Joan of Arc in the title role of Besson's Joan of Arc (1999). She next appeared with Mel Gibson in Wim Wenders' The Million Dollar Hotel (2000) which premiered at the Berlin Film Festival. She went on to co-star with Wes Bentley and Sarah Polley in The Claim (2000) and in Ben Stiller's spoof of the world of models and high-fashion, Zoolander (2001).Milla achieved box office success in the U.S. and around the world with the action-packed thriller, Resident Evil (2002), based on the wildly popular video game, Resident Evil. It was written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson. Milla reprised her role as the zombie slaying heroine, Alice, in Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004), Resident Evil: Extinction (2007), Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010), and again in Resident Evil: Retribution (2012). A sixth resident Evil movie is in production, and is due for release in 2014. She received glowing reviews opposite Oscar-winner Adrien Brody and Illeana Douglas in Dummy (2002) which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival. In the spring of 2006, Milla returned to the big screen as action heroine, Violet, in the futuristic film Ultraviolet (2006) directed by Kurt Wimmer.Focusing on her personal sense of style, her love of fashion led Milla and her friend and business partner, Carmen Hawk, to launch their Jovovich-Hawk clothing line, which achieved instant acclaim in the domestic and international fashion world. The fresh, unique line garnered the attention of red carpet watchers and fashion magazines, including American Vogue, who featured Jovovich-Hawk on their coveted list of "10 Things to Watch Out for in 2005."A student of voice and guitar since she was very young, Milla began writing songs for her first record at the age of 15. Her first album, "The Divine Comedy", was released by EMI Records in 1994. Informed by her experiences as a child growing up as a Russian emigrant in the Red-bashing Reagan era, the introspective European-folkish debut drew favorable reviews for Milla's songwriting and performing. Although, she has not released a follow-up album, she continues to write music, and has had songs featured on several film soundtracks. Charitable work also plays a major part in Milla's life. She has served as Master of Ceremonies and co-chaired with Elizabeth Taylor for the amfAR and Cinema Against AIDS event at the Venice Film Festival, and has been heavily involved with The Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, as well as The Wildlands Project.
      Father is a Serbian pediatrician, from Belgrade Serbia, who moved to Russia and married her mother there.
      Frequently attends big show business events such as celebrity parties, premieres, openings, fashion shows and awards shows. Is a fixture in magazine paparazzi sections because of this.
      It was announced that she is currently engaged to Resident Evil (2002) and Mortal Kombat (1995) director Paul W.S. Anderson (March, 2003).
      While filming the movie Dazed and Confused (1993), she eloped with actor Shawn Andrews to Las Vegas, Nevada. It was 1992 and a few months before she turned seventeen. Since she was only sixteen at the time, her mother had the marriage annulled.
      Went to high school with Christina Applegate; then later made a guest appearance on Married with Children (1987).
      Her music video "The Gentleman Who Fell" is based on Maya Deren's short film Meshes of the Afternoon (1943).
      At the age of just eleven, she was used in Revlon's "Most Unforgettable Women in the World" advertisements, which were shot by Richard Avedon.
      As a teenage girl, she lived with her single mother, because her father spent seven years in prison, and her parents divorced.
      She owns a 5559-square-foot house in Los Angeles' Hollywood Hills that she purchased in 1998 for $775,000. A 4026-square-foot house in Beverly Hills that she paid $2,223,000 for in 2004. And a 3010-square-foot house in the Doral Isles St. Croix development in Doral, Florida (just outside Miami) that she purchased in 2005 for $910,000.
      Sold her four-bedroom, 3582-square-foot house in Beverly Hills, California for $2.750 million. She originally purchased the house in late 2001 for $1.8 million.
      Returned to work four months after giving birth to her daughter Ever in order to begin filming A Perfect Getaway (2009).
      She is claustrophobic. She said the scariest thing she had done was the scene in Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) where her character had to be in a small tank.
      For The Fifth Element (1997), the production decided to dye Jovovich's hair from its natural brown color to her character's signature orange color. However, due to the fact that her hair had to be re-dyed regularly to maintain the bright color, Milla's hair quickly became too damaged and broken to withstand the dye. Most of Milla's hair fell out and eventually a wig was created to match the color and style of Leeloo's hair, and was used for the remainder of the production.
      I think that's one of the only reasons God created celebrities. To help those who can't help themselves.
      "If this movie was made in America they would have had a guy and we would have been his harem or entourage. Big studios don't trust that women will bring in that kind of audience, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) was really an exception to the rule. Most of the time, if you make a big action film there has to be a big action guy in it. It's very European to trust a woman to play that kind of a role" [on Resident Evil (2002)].
      About Madonna: "Oh, my God! I used to ride my bicycle around for hours in the garage of our apartment building singing 'Material Girl'" (In Style magazine, Sept/2006).
      [on Resident Evil (2002)] We've got really infantile mentalities on this movie. We're like: 'It's gross - cool! It's disgusting - print it!' You have to think like a fifteen -year-old. Wet dress. Zombies. Guns. Cool!".
      To be an actor you have to know yourself really well. That's been a major thing for me, to really understand why I do things.
=======================================================
Milla Jovovich (/ˈjoʊvəvɪtʃ/ YOH-və-vich born Milica Jovović[nb 1][nb 2]) (born December 17, 1975) is an American model, actress, musician, and fashion designer. She has appeared in numerous science fiction and action-themed films, earning her the sobriquet "reigning queen of kick-butt" from the music channel VH1 in 2006.[2]
In 1987 Jovovich began modeling at the age of 12 when Herb Ritts photographed her for the cover of the Italian magazine Lei ("She").[3][4] Richard Avedon featured her in Revlon's "Most Unforgettable Women in the World" advertisements, and she also starred in campaigns for major companies.[citation needed] In 1988, Jovovich had her first acting role in the television film, The Night Train to Kathmandu, and that year also appeared in her first feature film, Two Moon Junction.
Jovovich gained attention for her role in the explicit 1991 romance film Return to the Blue Lagoon, as she was then only 16.[5] She was considered to have a breakthrough with her role alongside Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman in the 1997 science-fiction film The Fifth Element, directed by Luc Besson. She and Besson married that year but soon divorced. She starred as the heroine and martyr in Besson's The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (1999).
In 2002, Jovovich starred in the film Resident Evil, adapted from the video game of the same name. It was disliked by critics,[6][7] but was commercially successful.[8] She reprised her role in four sequels made between 2004 and 2012.[9]
Jovovich released a music album, The Divine Comedy, in 1994. She continues to release demos for other songs on her official website and contributes to film soundtracks. In 2003, she and model Carmen Hawk created the clothing line Jovovich-Hawk. Jovovich has her own production company, Creature Entertainment.[10]
Milla Jovovich was born in 1975 in Kiev, Ukrainian SSR, former Soviet Union, the daughter of Bogić Jovović, a Serbian pediatrician,[11][12] and Galina Jovovich (née Loginova), a Russian stage actress.[13][14] She was raised in the Russian Orthodox religion.[15] She identifies as both Russian and Montenegrin,[16] and also Ukrainian.[17][18]
Milla's paternal family's estate was in Zlopek near Peć. Her paternal great-grandfather, Bogić Camić Jovović, was a flag-bearer of the Vasojevići clan and an officer in the guard of King Nicholas I of Montenegro; his wife was Milica, after whom Milla was named. Her paternal grandfather Bogdan Jovović was a commander in the Pristina military area. He investigated finances in Skopje and Sarajevo, where he uncovered massive gold embezzlement by the military. He was punished for refusing to testify against a friend charged in the crime. This resulted in the government briefly imprisoning Jovović in Goli otok. Fearing arrest again, he escaped to Albania and later moved to Kiev. (A different version of the story claims that he was the one who took the gold.) Milla's father Bogić and his sister later joined their father Bogdan in Kiev, where both siblings graduated in medicine.[19] Her mother Galina Loginova was born in Tuapse (now in Russia) but moved with her family in childhood to Dnipropetrovsk (now in Ukraine).[20] Her mother acted in several films, including Vykrutasy (a.k.a. "Lucky Trouble"), a Russian romantic comedy released in 2011, starring her daughter Milla and actor Konstantin Khabenskiy.
In 1980, when Milla was five years old, her family left the Soviet Union for political reasons[21] and moved to London. They subsequently immigrated to Sacramento, California, settling in Los Angeles seven months later. Milla's parents divorced soon after their arrival in Los Angeles.
In 1988, her father had a relationship with an Argentine woman, and they had a son, Marco Jovovich.[22][23] Due to her parents' divorce years before, Milla saw little of her half brother.[24]
In Los Angeles, Galina Jovovich tried to support her and Milla by acting jobs, but found little success because of language barriers, and eventually resorted to cleaning houses to earn money. Both parents served as cooks and housekeepers for director Brian De Palma.[25] Milla's father was convicted and imprisoned for participating in an illegal operation concerning medical insurance; he was given a 20-year sentence in 1994,[26] but was released in 1999 after serving five years.[27] According to Milla, "Prison was good for him. He's become a much better person. It gave him a chance to stop and think."[28]
Milla attended public schools in Los Angeles, becoming fluent in English in three months.[29] In school, she was teased by classmates for coming from the Soviet Union: "I was called a commie and a Russian spy. I was never, ever, ever accepted into the crowd."[30] At age 12, Milla left seventh grade to focus on modeling, which she had started at age nine.[31] She has said she was rebellious during her early teens, engaging in drug use, shopping mall vandalism, and credit-card fraud.[28] In 1994, she became naturalized as a U.S. citizen at the age of 19.[32]
When Milla was nine, Galina Jovovich began taking the girl to modeling auditions.[25] She was discovered by Gene Lemuel, who shot test photos of her and later showed them to Herb Ritts in Los Angeles.[3] The next day Ritts booked the 12-year-old Milla for the cover of Lei, an Italian magazine.[3] After this shoot, the young Jovovich was signed by Prima Modeling Agency.[33] Richard Avedon hired her for Mademoiselle.[3] Avedon was head of marketing at Revlon at the time, and chose Jovovich to appear with established models Alexa Singer and Sandra Zatezalo in Revlon's "Most Unforgettable Women in the World" advertisements.[34] In 1988, Jovovich made her first professional model contract.[21] She was among several very young models who ignited controversy by becoming involved in the industry; people worried about the girls in this environment.[35]
Later, Jovovich was featured on the cover of The Face, which led to new contracts and covers for both Vogue and Cosmopolitan.[21] Since then, she has been featured on more than 100 magazine covers, including all the major fashion ones in the US.[36] She has been part of campaigns for Banana Republic, Christian Dior, Damiani, Donna Karan, Gap, Versace, Calvin Klein, DKNY, Coach, Giorgio Armani, H&M, and Revlon. Since 1998, Jovovich has been an "international spokesmodel" for L'Oréal cosmetics. She was referred to in a minor cameo in Bret Easton Ellis' novel Glamorama, a satire of society's obsession with celebrities and beauty.[37]
Jovovich was said to be designer Miuccia Prada's muse in 2002;[35] a 2003 article claimed she was Gianni Versace's "favourite supermodel".[10] In 2004, Jovovich topped Forbes magazine's "Richest Supermodels of the World" list, earning a reported $10.5 million.[13]
In 2006, Jovovich was picked up by Mango, a Spanish clothing line, as their new spokesmodel and is featured in their ad campaigns;[38] she can also be seen in ads for Etro. She has noted that "Modeling was never a priority"[39] and that the money she earns enables her "to be selective about the creative decisions [she] make[s]".[10]
Jovovich's mother had "raised [her] to be a movie star."[28] In 1985, Galina enrolled Jovovich in the Professional Actors school in California.[21][40][41]
In 1988, Jovovich appeared in her first professional role as Lily McLeod in the made-for-television film The Night Train to Kathmandu. Later that year, she made her debut in a feature film as Samantha Delongpre in the romantic thriller Two Moon Junction. She had several roles in television series Paradise (1988), Married... with Children (1989) and Parker Lewis Can't Lose (1990).
At age 16, she was cast as the lead as Lilli Hargrave in Return to the Blue Lagoon (1991), opposite Brian Krause. Given her age and beauty, she was often compared to Brooke Shields, a child model-turned-actress who had starred in the original Blue Lagoon.[42] The role was controversial, as Jovovich appeared nude in the film, as had Shields in The Blue Lagoon..[30] For this role, Jovovich was nominated both for "Best Young Actress Starring in a Motion Picture" at the 1991 Young Artist Awards, and "Worst New Star" at the 1991 Golden Raspberry Awards.
In 1992, Milla Jovovich co-starred with Christian Slater in the comedy Kuffs. Later that year, she portrayed Mildred Harris in the Charlie Chaplin biographical film Chaplin. In 1993 she acted in Richard Linklater's film Dazed and Confused. She played Michelle Burroughs, on-screen girlfriend to Pickford (played by her then-boyfriend Shawn Andrews). Strongly featured in promotions for the film, Jovovich was upset to find her role much reduced in the released film.[42] Discouraged, she took a hiatus from acting roles,[43] moving to Europe. She started to work at music.
Jovovich returned to acting in 1997 with a lead role in the science fiction action film The Fifth Element, alongside Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman. This was directed by Luc Besson. She portrayed Leeloo, an alien who helps to save the planet. Jovovich said she "worked like hell: no band practice, no clubs, no pot, nothing"[44] to acquire the role and impress Besson. They married on December 14, 1997, but later divorced.[42]
Jovovich co-created and mastered an alien fictional language of over 400 words for her role.[42] She wore a costume that came to be known as the "ACE-bandage" costume; the body suit designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier was made of medical bandages.[42][45] The Fifth Element was selected as the opening film for the 1997 Cannes Film Festival and its worldwide box office gross was over $263 million, more than three times its budget of $80 million.[46] The Fifth Element was often praised for its visual style; critic James Berardinelli wrote, "Jovovich makes an impression, although her effectiveness has little to do with acting and less to do with dialogue".[47] Jovovich was nominated for "Favorite Female Newcomer" at the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards and "Best Fight" at the MTV Movie Awards. The film inspired a video game and a planned Leeloo action figure, but the figure was never released due to licensing problems.[48] In a 2003 interview, Jovovich said Leeloo was her favorite role.[49]
In 1998, Jovovich appeared in Spike Lee's drama He Got Game, as abused prostitute Dakota Burns; she acted with Denzel Washington and Ray Allen. In 1999, she appeared in the music video for the song "If You Can't Say No" by Lenny Kravitz. That year she returned to the action genre playing the title role in The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, under direction of Besson. She cut her hair short and wore armor in several extensive battle scenes. Jovovich received generally good reviews for her performance, although she also received a Razzie Award nomination for "Worst Actress".[42] The historical drama did moderately well at the box office, gaining $66 million worldwide.[50] In 2000, Jovovich appeared as the troubled Eloise in The Million Dollar Hotel, a film based on a concept story by Bono of the band U2 and Nicholas Klein. Directed by Wim Wenders, Jovovich starred alongside Jeremy Davies and Mel Gibson; she provided vocals on the film's soundtrack. That year she also played bar owner Lucia, in the British western film The Claim (2000). This was followed by a cameo as the evil Katinka in the comedy Zoolander (2001).
In 2002, Jovovich starred in the horror/action film Resident Evil, released in the United States on March 15, 2002 and based on the CAPCOM video game series of the same name. She portrayed Alice, the film's heroine, who fights a legion of zombies created by the Umbrella Corporation. Jovovich had accepted the role because she and her brother Marco had been fans of the video game franchise.[51] Jovovich had performed all the stunts required in the film, except for a scene that would involve her jumping to a cement platform, which her management deemed too dangerous,[52] and had trained in karate, kickboxing, and combat-training.[53] The film was commercially successful, grossing $17 million on its opening weekend, and gaining $40 million domestically and $102 million worldwide.[54] Later, she portrayed the manipulative gang wife Erin in No Good Deed (2002), Nadine in the romantic comedy You Stupid Man (2002), punk rocker Fangora ("Fanny") in Dummy (2003), and provided a guest voice on the television series King of the Hill. The role of Fangora in Dummy allowed Jovovich to act in film with Oscar-winning Adrien Brody, who was a friend prior to filming. Jovovich found it easy to identify with this role because she felt Fangora possessed similar qualities to the actress' own life.[49]
In 2004, Jovovich reprised the role of Alice in the sequel to Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Apocalypse. The role required her to do fight training for three hours a day,[49] in addition to the three months prior to filming in which she had "gun training, martial arts, everything".[55] Apocalypse received even more negative reactions from the critics than the first film, but it was an even greater commercial success, ranking number one at the box office unlike the first film. Following the release of the film, Jovovich was unhappy with the critical results and director Alexander Witt's effort.[56] She noted during an interview that year that her large action films take care of the commercial part of her career, while she acts in "independent little films that never come out" to appease her artistic side, and "It's a good balance".[49] The following year, she was featured in Gore Vidal's faux trailer remake of Caligula, as Drusilla. In 2006, Jovovich's film, the science fiction/action thriller Ultraviolet, was released on March 3. She played the title role of Violet Song jat Shariff, a role that also involved heavily choreographed fight sequences. It was not screened for critics, but when reviewed, it was critically panned,[57] grossing $31 million worldwide.[58] That year, Jovovich also starred in .45, as Kat, the revenge driven girlfriend of an illegal gun and drug dealer with Scottish actor and DJ Angus Macfadyen.
In 2007, Jovovich reprised her role as Alice in Resident Evil: Extinction, the third of the Resident Evil series. The film grossed an estimated $24 million in 2,828 theaters on its opening weekend, topping the box office gross for that week.[59] It opened stronger than its predecessor, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, which opened with $23 million in 3,284 theaters (over 450 more theaters than Extinction).[60] In a March 2006 interview, Jovovich said that she would not appear in another action film "for a long time", expressing a desire to portray more diverse roles,[citation needed] but she added that talks of another sequel in the Resident Evil franchise were a "real possibility".[61][62]
In 2009, Jovovich starred in David Twohy's A Perfect Getaway with Kiele Sanchez, Timothy Olyphant, and Steve Zahn. The film is a thriller about a newlywed couple (Milla and Zahn) on their honeymoon in Hawaii. Filming began Spring 2008.[56]
Jovovich played Lucetta, the wife of a jailed arsonist (played by Edward Norton) in Stone, a psychological thriller starring Robert De Niro. Filming began in May 2009 at the recently closed Southern Michigan Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan.[63]
Jovovich played the role of Dr. Abigail Tyler in the science-fiction thriller The Fourth Kind[64] and starred in the psychological thriller Faces in the Crowd,[65] which was written and directed by Julien Magnat;[66] in the latter film, she plays the survivor of a serial killer’s attack that leaves her suffering from a condition called prosopagnosia, which renders her unable to recognize faces.[67]
Jovovich returned as Alice[68] in the fourth movie of the Resident Evil series, Afterlife, which was directed by her husband, Paul W. S. Anderson.[69] She had a role in Dirty Girl, which premiered on September 12, 2010 at the Toronto Film Festival, opposite Juno Temple, William H. Macy, Mary Steenburgen, and Tim McGraw. Jovovich starred in Paul W. S. Anderson's The Three Musketeers, as Milady de Winter, in 2011.
Jovovich is set to star in David R. Ellis' horror film Bad Luck, based on a screenplay by David J. Schow.[70] She appeared in Famke Janssen's directorial debut film Bringing Up Bobby, which also stars Marcia Cross. Vykrutasy, a Russian film which translates into Lucky Trouble, also stars Jovovich.
Jovovich was set to portray Amalia Bezhetskaya in The Winter Queen in 2007; however, with the announcement of her pregnancy early that year, the film was postponed. In the spring of 2011, Seven Arts and GFM Films announced they would be merging their distribution operations. The joint venture is expected to release The Winter Queen under the direction of Fyodor Bondarchuk.[71]
She returned to her role as Alice in the fifth installment of Resident Evil for Resident Evil: Retribution, which was released on September 14, 2012.[72]
Jovovich has been nominated for numerous awards. In 1992, she was nominated for Best Young Actress Starring in a Motion Picture at the Young Artist Awards for her role in Return to the Blue Lagoon.[73]
In 1997, she was nominated for the Saturn Best Supporting Actress award,[74] the Blockbuster Entertainment Best New Actress award,[75] and the MTV Movie Best Fight Scene Award (between her and aliens)[76] for her role as Leeloo in The Fifth Element. Conversely she also received a nomination for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress for the role as well.[77]
In 2002, she received a nomination for the Saturn Best Actress Award for her role as Alice in Resident Evil and won Best Actress in a sci-fi/action film for Resident Evil: Extinction from the Scream Awards in 2008.
She was also nominated for Best Horror Actress at the 2010 Scream Awards for her performance as Dr. Abigail Tyler in The Fourth Kind, and won the Hollywood Spotlight Award for Best Actress at the 14th Annual Hollywood Awards Gala for her role as Lucetta in the 2010 film Stone.[78]
Jovovich had begun working on a music album as early as 1988, when she was signed by SBK Records after the company heard a demo she recorded.[79] In August 1990, she asserted in an interview that the then-forthcoming album would be "a mix between Kate Bush, Sinéad O'Connor, This Mortal Coil, and the Cocteau Twins".[80] After it was initially presented by SBK strictly as a pop album, Jovovich protested, insisting on using her personal poetry for lyrics and recording her own instrumental material.[79] Jovovich had written the songs when she was fifteen, with the exception of a Ukrainian folk song, "In a Glade", that she covered. In April 1994, billed under her first name, she released The Divine Comedy, a title that was a reference to the epic poem by Dante Alighieri of the same name. Jovovich had chosen the title after seeing Russian artist Alexis Steele's proposed cover artwork sketch for the then untitled album. Jovovich found that the sketch had "all the struggle that I'm singing about. It IS the divine comedy".[79] The Divine Comedy was well received by critics, and featured pop-infused traditional Ukrainian folk songs that led to comparisons with musicians Tori Amos and Kate Bush.[25] John McAlley of Rolling Stone called the album "remarkable", "strikingly mature and rich in invention", and as featuring "angst-laced poetry with vivid melodies and arrangements that find a common spirit in synth pop, European folk and psychedelic dream rock".[81] Jovovich released the track "Gentleman Who Fell", with an accompanying music video, as the sole single from the album. The music video was originally directed by Lisa Bonet and featured Harry Dean Stanton, but Jovovich was unsatisfied with the results and decided to film another version. The second version of "Gentleman Who Fell", a homage to Maya Deren's short film Meshes of the Afternoon (1943), was subsequently played on MTV. Jovovich toured the United States during most of 1994 to promote the album, opening for Toad the Wet Sprocket and Crash Test Dummies, as well as playing smaller acoustic sets. Jovovich had opted to perform in smaller and more intimate settings, turning down a musical appearance on Saturday Night Live. Milla has also been collaborating musically with longtime friend and musician Chris Brenner, who co-wrote with her on the Divine Comedy Album and who was the musical coordinator for the supporting tour. She and Brenner met in 1993 and have since worked together on several ventures.[82] Following The Divine Comedy, she expressed interest in releasing a second album, having had ten songs ready for a future recording that was intended for a Summer 1996 release.[30][31] Despite the appearance of a lo-fi field recording The People Tree Sessions in 1998, Jovovich has yet to release a second album.
In May 1999, Jovovich along with Chris Brenner formed an experimental band called Plastic Has Memory, in which she wrote the songs, sang, and played electric guitar.[83] The band was "[m]uch heavier and darker than the vaguely Ukrainian folk-sounding elements of her first album" and had a similar sound to a grunge and trip hop Portishead.[84] Plastic Has Memory played about a dozen shows in Los Angeles and New York City for a potential Virgin Records album release,[85] one of which Mick Jagger had attended.[86] Though Plastic Has Memory was featured on Hollywood Goes Wild, a benefit celebrity compilation album, the group never formally released a record and is no longer together.[87]
Jovovich has contributed tracks to several of her film soundtracks, including The Million Dollar Hotel (2000) and Dummy (2002), and has also provided songs for the soundtracks of films in which she has not acted such as Underworld (2003) produced by musician Danny Lohner who was the bass player in Nine Inch Nails for many years. Her song "The Gentlemen Who Fell" was featured on the The Rules of Attraction soundtrack in 2002. In 2001, Jovovich was one of many celebrities whose vocals were featured in a cover of "We are Family" to raise money for the American Red Cross. She has appeared as guest vocalist on the song "Former Lover" on Deepak Chopra's album, A Gift of Love II: Oceans of Ecstasy (2002) and Legion of Boom (2004) by The Crystal Method.
Since 2003, Jovovich has worked with musician Maynard James Keenan, of Tool and A Perfect Circle, on his Industrial side project Puscifer,[88] contributing vocals to the track "REV 22:20", which was featured on various film soundtracks in its original or a remixed form.[89] As of January, 2009, she can be heard collaborating with Maynard and Danny Lohner on the Puscifer track called, "The Mission." She also performed the song at the first live Puscifer performance on February 13, 2009 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Danny Lohner, and longtime music collaborator Chris Brenner currently continue to record and perform with Jovovich who has made several highly praised appearances in recent years.
Jovovich continues to write songs which she refers to as "demos", and which are provided for free in MP3 format on her official website. She provides license to freely download and remix the tracks, but reserves the right to sell and issue them.[90]
She announced via Twitter and her official website a new single called Electric Sky would be released. It was released on May 18, 2012 and it will be part of an EP she will be releasing. The date of its release has not been announced.[91] The song was presented at the Life Ball in 2012.
Jovovich and fellow model Carmen Hawk launched a line of clothing called Jovovich-Hawk in 2003. The pair opened a showroom in New York City's Greenwich Village on September 13, 2005, and the line lasted for four years. All of the dresses for Jovovich-Hawk line were designed by herself and her partner Carmen Hawk, in The atelier is based in Los Angeles, but pieces could be found at Fred Segal in Los Angeles, Harvey Nichols, and over 50 stores around the world. Vogue has praised the line for its "girl-about-town cult status most designers spend years trying to achieve."[92]
In November 2006, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and US Vogue nominated Jovovich-Hawk for the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Award. Jovovich-Hawk was nominated as a finalist, although Doo-Ri Chung took the top prize.[93]
In 2007, Jovovich and Hawk designed the costume for Jovovich's character in Resident Evil: Extinction. The shorts Alice, her character, wears are a variation on the 'Alice Star' Shorts from the Spring 2007 collection.[94] In late 2007, Jovovich-Hawk signed a deal to design a diffusion collection for Target's Go International campaign, following in the footsteps of Luella, Paul & Joe and Proenza Schouler.[95]
In late 2008, Jovovich and Hawk mutually agreed to end the business due to increased demands on their time. Jovovich explained, "I'm an artist. I'm not someone who can deal with shipping rates and taxes".[96]
Jovovich has been noted for her careers as a model, singer and actress. Music channel VH1 has referred to her as the "reigning queen of kick-butt" for her roles in various sci-fi and action films[2] and Rebecca Flint Marx of Allmovie said that despite the negative critical response for the Resident Evil films, the franchise has turned Jovovich into an "A-list action star".[97] Her action roles have given her a geek[98] following for which MTV said she was "Every Geek's Dream Girl".[98][99]
In 2004, Jovovich was ranked No. 69 on Maxim magazine's "Top 100 Hot List",[100] ranked No. 82 in 2005 and ranked No. 21 in 2010.[101] Maxim also named her No. 11 on their list of "Hottest Nerd Crushes".[102] In 2008, she was ranked No. 90 on Ask Men's Top 99 Women of 2008 List.[103] In 2011, Jovovich attended and sang at the birthday celebration of Mikhail Gorbachev. The actress also gave a speech in which she thanked Gorbachev, saying that when she and her family left the Soviet Union in 1980 they were sadly sure that they would never see their relatives again and that thanks to him they have been reunited again.[104]
Jovovich was born in the Ukrainian SSR of the former Soviet Union to a Russian mother and a Serbian father.[105] She has stated that her native language is Russian, and that she never learned to speak Serbian well. In addition to Russian and English, she also speaks some French.[82][106][107] She had referred to the role the Russian culture played in her life when she stated in 2005: "I have Russian mother, she was a famous actress in the USSR (Galina Loginova). And the first books, which I read, were in Russian. I was raised in the atmosphere of the Russian classical theatre school. The art, built on the system of Stanislavsky – that's the most realistic art. And the modern cinema stands on the same principle. A Russian person wants to find the truth. This is the base of the Russian culture. I never forget it, especially since I have Russian roots".[105] Jovovich established a charitable foundation in 2005 to help Ukrainian children.[17] At the time she referred to herself: "I am a strong Ukrainian girl, that is why I work a lot".[17]
Jovovich currently resides in homes in Los Angeles and New York[108] with her husband, film writer and director Paul W. S. Anderson, whom she married on 22 August 2009.[109] The two met while working on the 2002 film Resident Evil, which Anderson wrote and directed, and in which Jovovich starred. Anderson proposed to Jovovich in 2003, but the two separated for a period of time before becoming a couple again.[110] On November 3, 2007, Jovovich gave birth to her and Anderson's first child, a daughter, Ever Gabo Anderson.[111] The child was born at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California.[112]
Prior to her relationship with Anderson, Jovovich married on-screen boyfriend Shawn Andrews in 1992 while filming Dazed and Confused together. Andrews was 21, while Jovovich was 16; the marriage was annulled by her mother two months later.[113] Shortly after the annulment, Jovovich moved to Europe with her friend and musician Chris Brenner where she met and then lived with her new boyfriend, Jamiroquai ex-bassist Stuart Zender, in London from May 1994 to October 1995.[26][82][114] From 1995 to 1997, she dated photographer Mario Sorrenti. In Las Vegas, she married The Fifth Element director Luc Besson in 1997 where they went skydiving directly after the ceremony; they divorced in 1999.[10] Between 1998 and 2001, she befriended the young poet and musician, Anno Birkin, and each was the other's inspiration behind many of their compositions. Jovovich became involved with Birkin romantically just before his death in a car accident on November 8, 2001. Jovovich also dated[27] former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante, for seven months in 2000.[42]
In 2006, Jovovich mentioned that she had kept a diary since childhood, writing about the locations she has traveled and "all the mad things that [she's] done". Jovovich stated that publication could be a way to "get it all into a book—like an autobiography, but with more of a diary feel to it." However, she also commented that she was "...not sure how interested anyone would be in publishing it, or reading it, for that matter".[115] In 2010, Jovovich claimed that any autobiography publication plans were pure rumor, stating, "I have no idea where that came from. I guess somebody said something about me publishing my diaries online and when I heard that I was like, 'No way'".[116]
In addition to being a former[117] smoker,[118] Jovovich has advocated the legalization of cannabis, and appeared in a spread and on the cover for High Times.[35] In an article published in 1994, she admitted that her only vices were cigarettes and cannabis.[82] She practices yoga and meditates often in attempts to live a healthy lifestyle; although not affiliating with any specific religion, she prays and considers herself a "spiritual person".[56] She avoids junk foods and prefers to cook for herself. She practices Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in addition to other varieties of martial arts. Jovovich also enjoys playing the guitar, and writing poems and lyrics for songs.[119]

Milla Jovovich (pronounced "mee-luh" "yo-vo-vitch") was born December 17, 1975 in Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine to father Bogdanovitch Jovovich (Serbian doctor) and mother Galina Loginova Jovovich (Russian actress). In 1981, Milla and her family left the Soviet Union and moved to London, England and then to Sacramento, California, ultimately settling in Los Angeles.
Milla married director Paul W.S. Anderson (director/writer of the Resident Evil series) on August 22, 2009. They have a daughter together, Ever Gabo J. Anderson	 (born 11.03.07).
Milla and Paul have worked together on the Resident Evil franchise and will team up again for the 3-D version of The Three Musketeers (2011).
At the age of eleven, Jovovich was spotted by photographer Richard Avedon, who featured her in Revlon's "Most Unforgettable Women in the World" advertisements. In October 1987, she was on the cover of the Italian fashion magazine Lei, her first of many covers. In 1988, she signed her first professional modeling contract. 
Milla has appeared in hundreds of magazines and on dozens of covers. She has been featured in ad campaigns for several brands, including Banana Republic, Christian Dior, Damiani, Donna Karan, Gap, Versace, Mango, Etro and several others (see "Gallery" dropdown menu above). Milla has recently been in campaigns for Chic Outlet Shopping, ICB, Ann Taylor, Mercedes-Benz, Metrocity, and Jacob & Co. Milla starred in 2012 calendars for Campari and Pirelli.
Milla's early modeling led to acting roles, and in 1988 she appeared in her first film role in the romance thriller Two Moon Junction. Her first leading role was in Return to the Blue Lagoon in 1991, for which she was nominated for the "Best Young Actress Starring in a Motion Picture" in the 1991 Young Artist Awards. 
She appeared on some TV shows around this time and also in the films Kuffs (1992), Chaplin (1992), and Dazed and Confused (1993).
Milla's breakout role was as Leeloo, the perfect being in Luc Besson's The Fifth Element (1997). She later starred in several other action movies, including Ultraviolet (2006), A Perfect Getaway (2009), and The Fourth Kind (2009).
Milla and husband Paul W.S. Anderson have made 5 Resident Evil films to date: Resident Evil (2002), Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004), Resident Evil: Extinction (2007), Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010), and Resident Evil: Retribution (2012).

In 1994, Milla released her critically acclaimed folk album, The Divine Comedy. Inspired by a love of "elves and magic trees", Milla wrote the lyrics at 15 and recorded the album when she was just 16. Acoustic, folky, and hard to categorize, the eleven songs on The Divine Comedy are laced with Slavic sadness and X-istential self-doubt. "In a Glade" is a beautiful traditional Ukrainian folk song that Milla sings in her native tongue. 
Milla led a band called Plastic Has Memory which played about a dozen shows in Los Angeles and New York City in 1999. Although Plastic Has Memory never released a record, they did contribute one song, "On the Hill", to Hollywood Goes Wild, a benefit CD for The Wildlife Waystation. 
Milla performed the song "Left and Right" at Fashion Rocks in London, England in October 2003 (MP3). 
She has also had songs on several albums, including 2 cover versions of Lou Reed's "Satellite of Love" on the The Million Dollar Hotel soundtrack (2000), "Rocket Collecting" on the Underworld soundtrack (2003), and "Shein Vi Di L'Vone" & "Mezinka" (Yiddish Klezmer songs) on the Dummy soundtrack (2003).
Milla has collaborated with Puscifer (Maynard James Keenan of Tool and A Perfect Circle) several times. She sang on "Rev 22:20" on the Underworld soundtrack (2003) and also on the Renholder remix of The Cure's "Underneath The Stars" on the Underworld: Rise of the Lycans soundtrack (2009).
Milla also sings on "The Mission" [ listen at puscifer.com ] and performed live with Puscifer at The Pearl in Las Vegas on February 13, 2009 [ video ].
Milla released the single "Electric Sky" on May 18, 2012 and performed it the following night in Vienna, Austria at the Life Ball. [ Amazon ]
