 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Sasha Grey was born on March 14, 1988 in Sacramento, California, USA as Marina Ann Hantzis. She is an actress and director, known for The Girlfriend Experience (2009).
      On April 8, 2011, she announced her retirement from adult films on her official page on Facebook.
      Co-founder of the industrial noise band aTelecine. They play death dub, ambient, and experimental genres.
      I was born in Sacramento, CA, and moved to [Los Angeles] when I turned 18 to pursue a career as a porn star. I grew up in North Highlands [a section of Sacramento]. It is a disenfranchised, lower-to-middle-class neighborhood. I never allowed myself to be a negative product of that environment. I used it as a source of inspiration to challenge myself. I began college in August of 2005, balancing school and work seven days a week. Around this time I started thinking about pornography as a career opportunity. I have a huge appetite for sex and self-exploration. I wanted to express my sexuality as a strong woman, to push my own boundaries and see which part of my psyche would take me to my next euphoric sexual experience. I wanted to do all of this in a sex-positive way. Despite the controversy that surrounds this industry, I felt I could ultimately bring an enigmatic quality to it. I decided that if my instinct continued to push me toward the reality of this, and the dissatisfaction with my education continued, I would seize the opportunity on my own. I began my research that month, making my decision absolute in October 2005. On April 17th, 2006 I moved to [Los Angeles], got tested at AIM and found an agent. I performed my first sex scene on May 1st, 2006 in Fashionistas Safado: The Challenge (2006). Although I have come a long way since then, many people in society believe that I am a victim. I was not sexually abused. I am not on drugs. The acts I perform are always consensual. I am a woman who strongly believes in what she does--it is time that our society comes to grips with the fact that "normal" people, women especially, enjoy perverse sex. I hope to inspire people from all walks of life, and to collaborate with innovative individuals--bohemians welcome. Many people mistake this thought and believe that I desire all women to do porn and fuck like rabbits, ignoring all health risks. This is not what I preach or believe. Like any business, I take risks in my profession. Anyone considering porn as a career should be fully aware of these risks before jumping in. I am ready to take on any opportunities and challenges that face me as a woman, porn star and artist.
=======================================================
Sasha Grey (born Marina Ann Hantzis;[1] March 14, 1988) is an American former pornographic actress[4][5] who has since crossed over as a mainstream actress, model, author and musician.[6][7] She first made her name in mainstream media after appearing on several popular television programs and in pop culture magazines examining her willingness to enter the world of hardcore porn at such a young age.[8][9] She has also been featured in music videos and advertising campaigns.[10][11] She won numerous awards between 2007 and 2010, including the AVN Female Performer of the Year Award in 2008.
After her feature film debut as the lead in Steven Soderbergh's The Girlfriend Experience, she shifted her focus to mainstream acting.[5] She starred in the black comedy/horror film Smash Cut, and played a semi-fictionalized version of herself in the seventh season of the HBO television series Entourage. She has also appeared in independent films, such as I Melt With You. She is a former member of aTelecine, an industrial music band.[7][12][13]
In May 2006, Grey moved to Los Angeles and began appearing in adult films just after turning 18.[8] Originally she toyed with the name Anna Karina,[8] taken after the French New Wave actress, before deciding on her present name. The name "Sasha" was taken from Sascha Konietzko of the band KMFDM,[14] and "Grey" represents Oscar Wilde's novel The Picture of Dorian Gray.[15] Her first scene was an orgy with Rocco Siffredi for The Fashionistas 2 by John Stagliano. Grey quickly made a name for herself in the business after she asked Siffredi to punch her in the stomach; however, she later stated that she was improvising and it was taken out of context.[16]
In January 2007, Grey was the recipient of awards for "Best Three Way Sex Scene" and "Best Group Scene" at the AVN Adult Movie Awards.[17]She was also nominated as "Best New Starlet", but lost to Naomi.[17] Grey was named Penthouse magazine Pet of The Month for July 2007[18] and was photographed by fashion photographer Terry Richardson.[19]
In 2008, she became the youngest person to win the AVN "Female Performer of the Year" award[20] and "Best Oral Sex Scene".[21] Grey formerly represented herself in the adult industry through her own agency, L.A. Factory Girls.[22] Grey has indicated particular appreciation for the work of Andrew Blake and Kimberly Kane.[23] A. O. Scott of The New York Times described her pornographic career as "distinguished both by the extremity of what she is willing to do and an unusual degree of intellectual seriousness about doing it."[24] In 2009, she was voted number 1 on Genesis magazine's 11th annual edition of its "Porn's Hot 100" issue[25][26]
Less than six months after entering the adult industry, Grey was featured in the November 2006 edition of Los Angeles where she was flagged as a potential major star, perhaps the next Jenna Jameson.[8] In December 2006, Grey was interviewed on the syndicated entertainment industry news show The Insider.
In February 2007, she appeared on The Tyra Banks Show, discussing teenagers in the sex industry. There was speculation that the show was heavily manipulated through editing, and did not include her defense of pornography as a career choice. The show was also criticized for twisting Grey's depiction to increase its dramatic value.[27][28]
In 2011, she was named by CNBC as one of the 12 most popular stars in porn.[30] CNBC noted that, while she is no longer acting in porn films, her current mainstream roles have kept interest in her earlier porn work high, and several companies continue to release compilations of it. Grey filmed her last pornographic movie at age 21, although she did not announce her retirement for some time after, realizing that many of her fans still believed her to be an active performer in the industry.[31] On April 8, 2011, she officially announced her retirement from adult films on Facebook.[32]
Grey has been an advocate for the adult industry and defended her choice to be a porn actress. In a March 2014 interview, she spoke in defense of the industry and on behalf of outed Duke University student turned porn star, Belle Knox.[33]
She has modeled for French fashion designer Max Azria's ready to wear line Manoukian,[34][35] Italian footwear brand Forfex for an international campaign,[11] and American Apparel. She's modeled for Richard Kern as a part of Vice magazine's anti-fashion layout, and appeared in a three-part VBS program, "Shot by Kern".[36] She also appeared in Taschen’s 25th anniversary reprint of Terry Richardson’s Terryworld.[37] Among other collaborations with Richardson, she has also appeared in Wives, Wheels, Weapons, a companion book to James Frey's Bright Shiny Morning. She has also modeled for artists James Jean, Frédéric Poincelet,[38] Zak Smith,[39] and David Choe.[40]
Grey has appeared in Playboy Magazine twice, first in a December 2009 pictorial, and then for the cover feature in October 2010.[5][41][42] In January 2010, Grey appeared nude in an ad campaign for PETA advocating animal birth control.[43] In February 2010, Grey stated in a PETA interview, "I think spaying and neutering is incredibly important. … [I]t keeps the animals out of the shelters, and there's too many unwanted animals out there already".[44]
Grey appeared in an episode of James Gunn's PG Porn with James Gunn,[45] as well as a cameo role[46] in Dick Rude's independent film Quit, and stars in[47] the 2009 Canadian low-budget black comedy/horror film Smash Cut from the Ottawa-based Odessa/Zed Filmworks. She plays a TV news personality who goes undercover as an actress in a horror film production, only to discover her older sister's murderer. In March 2010, Grey was cast as an anti-sex Christian in the horror film Hallows, directed by Richard O'Sullivan.[48]
Grey played the lead role, "Chelsea", an escort girl who is paid to act as the clients' girlfriend, in Academy Award-winning director Steven Soderbergh's film The Girlfriend Experience.[49][50] Soderbergh cast her after reading the article[8] profiling her in Los Angeles magazine, commenting that, "She's kind of a new breed, I think. She doesn't really fit the typical mold of someone who goes into the adult film business...I'd never heard anybody talk about the business the way that she talked about it."[51] In having Grey prepare for her role in The Girlfriend Experience, Soderbergh asked her to watch Godard's Vivre sa vie and Pierrot le fou.[52] Vivre sa vie concerns prostitution, while the relationship portrayed in Pierrot le fou was suggested as a model for the dynamic between Chelsea and her boyfriend and clients.[23] Grey and Soderbergh also interviewed two escorts, and borrowed character traits and behavior from them.[23] Critics had mixed assessments of Grey's performance.[53][54][55][56]
Grey was cast for the seventh season of the HBO show Entourage, where she played a fictionalized version of herself. Her character was Vincent Chase's new girlfriend in a multi-episode arc.[57] Grey co-starred alongside Thomas Jane, Carla Gugino, Jeremy Piven, and Rob Lowe in the thriller I Melt With You which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2011.[58] She then starred in the Indonesian film Shrouded Corpse Bathing While Hip-Shaking. The film premiered in Indonesia on April 28, 2011.[59] She subsequently starred in the French film Life, which was released on DVD in France on August 10, 2011, and voiced the character Viola DeWynter in the 2011 video game Saints Row: The Third, which was released in November 2011. In 2013, she appeared alongside Mariya Ocher in the German documentary series Durch die Nacht mit …, their episode airing on German and French television on December 7, 2013.[60]
In February of that same year, she appeared in the music video for Eminem's song "Space Bound".[61] Grey plays the role of Eminem's girlfriend, whom Eminem strangles only to realize she is just a figment of his imagination.[62] The video was premiered on Vevo on June 27, 2011.[63] Previously, she appeared in the music video for the 2008 song "Birthday Girl" by The Roots.[64] She also is featured in the artwork for The Smashing Pumpkins 2007 album Zeitgeist[10] and appears in the music video for their song "Superchrist".[65]
In 2008, Grey began an industrial music collaboration, called aTelecine, with Pablo St. Francis.[7] They later added members Anthony D' Juan and Ian Cinnamon.[12] Their first EP, aVigillant Carpark, was released in 2009 by New York label Pendu Sound on 7-inch vinyl only.[12] Grey also contributed vocals to the Current 93 album Aleph at Hallucinatory Mountain.[66] She also regularly performs as a DJ in the US and Canada.[67] In 2010, aTelecine released their first LP, ...And Six Dark Hours Pass, and in November of the same year followed it up with the LP A Cassette Tape Culture.[68] In August 9, 2011, aTelecine's first full length album, The Falcon and the Pod, was released; this album is the first of a planned trilogy.[69][70] Along with her work with Eminem, Sasha Grey is also listed by Narnack Records website as a guest artist on Repentance,[71] the 54th studio album by Grammy-winning[71][72] reggae and dub icon[71][73] Lee "Scratch" Perry, though Perry himself denied her involvement in a 2009 interview.[73]
aTelecine's world first live concert took place on October 20, 2012 in Kraków in Museum of Urban Engineering during Unsound Festival.[74]
In July 2013, it was announced that Sasha Grey was no longer a member of the group and that Ian Cinnamon and new vocalist, Sveio, were the only remaining full-time members.[13]
Grey's first photo book, Neü Sex, was released on March 29, 2011.[75][76][77] Her second book, The Juliette Society, an erotic novel, was released on May 9, 2013.[78]

Grey was born and raised in North Highlands, California, to a working-class family. Her mother worked for the state of California, and her father was a mechanic.[8] She is of English, Greek, Irish, and Polish descent.[83] Her parents divorced when she was five years old, and she was subsequently raised by her mother, who remarried in 2000.
Grey attended four high schools, among them Highlands High, having been unhappy in each one,[8] though she graduated a year early at 17.[84] In late 2005, she attended Sacramento City College[85] and took classes in film, dance, and acting.[8] She waited tables at a steakhouse through March 2006 and saved $7,000 for a move to Los Angeles.[8]
Grey states that her parents were not happy with her involvement in the adult industry, but that they are on good terms nonetheless.[86] Since 2006, she has been developing an autobiographical documentary, illustrating her experiences from the age of 18 to 21.[87] She was reported in a 2009 Rolling Stone interview as being engaged to filmmaker Ian Cinnamon.[88] She identifies herself as bisexual.[89]
In November 2011, Grey participated in the Guest Reading Program at Emerson Elementary School (Compton, California). Reportedly, her involvement in such activity was first denied to the media by school officials. Parents were upset that a former pornographic actress would read to their children as part of an education program. Grey responded to the controversy by stating, "I believe education is a universal right. I committed to this program with the understanding that people would have their own opinions about what I have done, who I am, and what I represent."[90][91][92] Grey also appeared on the American talk show The View, where she explained that she thought the parents should have been given prior notice of the identity of anyone who did guest reading, and that if parents had objected to her, she would not have done it.[93]

=======================================================
Sasha Grey is an exited pornography victim who was known for participating in nearly all the degrading types of acts available in pornography. Before her retirement, she was the best-known woman in the industry besides Jenna Jameson (source Pornland by Gail Dines, p. 41). At her first shoot shortly after her 18th birthday, she asked her costar/paid rapist to punch her in the stomach. She also claims to have invented licking a toilet seat as part of a scene in pornography.
After only being in the porn industry for about three years, Ms. Grey has retired from the filmed exploitation business. But why, if the industry was so lucrative and she loved sex so much, did she retire?
As Grey said on her official announcement, she has retired because her “time as an adult film performer has expired”. That is, at 21 years old, she and old milk have a lot in common. Why is it that three years of life in the industry has taxed her so?
It could be the degrading acts that she has performed in the course of her career. Her manager states that when she came to him, she stated that she was ready to participate in all of the acts that occur in the industry. Grey has built a name for herself as “Willing to do any sex necessary to be a star.” (source Pornland p. 40). Perhaps the incidents of STIs, the scratches, bruises, and  hemorrhoids, caused by the acts she engages in, or the threat of a prolapsed anus have taken their toll on Grey.
However, Grey has insisted that she enjoyed her time in the industry. She has claimed that three quarters of the time on set, she has experienced genuine orgasms, and says she is actually fighting to liberate women sexually. She claims that she has joined the industry where she experiences “self-exploration first hand, and I’m getting to do it in a sex-positive way.” She’s even gone so far as to say that her reason for entering pornography was to free herself from sexual shame, and take the stigma out of the industry.
But women in prostitution and pornography often parrot a positive message about their degradation. Indeed, it is part of a pornstituted woman’s job to maintain the illusion that she enjoys the industry.  Jenna Jameson is one such pornography victim who often states that filmed rape/pornography is empowering, and that her interest in pornography sprung from her high libido (source Pornland p. 35-38). However, this message is not always consistently positive, which can lead us to questions about how authentically “empowering” they actually believe pornography to be. As Jameson says in her book:
Most girls get their first experience in gonzo films — in which they’re taken to a crappy studio apartment in Mission Hills and penetrated in every hole possible by some abusive asshole who thinks her name is Bit***. And these girls, some of whom have the potential to become major stars in the industry, go home afterward and pledge never to do it again because it was such a terrible experience. But, unfortunately, they can’t take that experience back, so they live the rest of their days in fear that their relatives, their co-workers, or their children will find out, which they inevitably do.
So, too, can we see that Grey is not always consistent in her message that she enjoyed the acts she participated in, or that filmed rape/pornography is good for women. For example, she admits that 99% of the orgasms in pornography are faked. This contradicts her earlier statement that she experienced an orgasm in 3/4 of the scenes she participated in. Further, she expresses disgust with some of the acts she had to endure. Also, she admits that she would not want to be abused the way she is in pornography by an intimate partner or in her personal life.
Sasha Grey is not so enamored with the pornstitution industry as she claims. At another time she gives the following reason for quitting pornography [italics mine]:
I got a great opportunity to be in a Steven Soderberg film and after that I changed my mind and I just decided I was going to go for that, and try something different and try something new. [...] I felt like I had accomplished what i wanted to as a performer.
Sasha Grey admits to changing her mind about pornography when she had another opportunity presented to her. She, a woman who was first exposed to pornography as an underage girl (some accounts state that she was 16, and others state she was 11), has realized that engaging in degrading, violent, pornographic acts is not for her.
In 2009, however, it was clear to at least one person that Ms. Grey was not in pornography because she loved it so much– she was planning on using it as a stepping stone to non-adult films all along.
Sasha pointedly decided to have an extreme presence to achieve entree to Hollywood,” says Nick Jarecki, executive producer of the new Mike Tyson documentary, who met with her last year about a role in another movie. “My impression of her attitude is that porn, while part of her pastiche, is ultimately a gateway to her mainstream ideas and acting career.
But this Moulin Rouge-esque fantasy is impossible for almost every pornography victim. Stories like Gray’s only serve to recruit more exceptionally young women to this damaging and dangerous industry, to be spit out when they have “expired”.
Pornography is the act of making hate to women’s bodies. Sasha Grey is a very smart woman, and I’m so glad for her sake that she has exited the pornstitution industry. However, her success has helped recruit more young women to the filmed rape victim business, for their bodies to be used just as hers was. There’s nothing progressive, or positive about that.

thanks smash!  it is definitely telling that the shelf life for your average female porn star is so short.  if it was so great and not-harmful, why not just keep doing it forever?  why do so many of them not last even a year or 2 or 5?
porn is not compatible with life, when you are female.  male-centric sexuality is not compatible with life, when you are female.  and mens insistence on both only proves that they are death-fetishists and necrophiliacs.  men kill women, and when they dont kill us outright, they kill our creativity, and definitely our sexuality.  i would say that men kill what they claim to love, if i thought most of them bothered lying about loving women anymore.  they dont.  the hatred is becoming more and more obvious, and much of this comes through in porn.
Also, she admits that she would not want to be abused the way she is in pornography by an intimate partner or in her personal life.
That would be a mission impossible I think. Any future intimate partner is likely to have seen her porn films, and want her to do for him, what he saw her doing with the dudes on film. And you just know in order to get her to do that, he will say something like “if you really loved me, you would do it, after all you did it with some stranger dude…” I really wish I had £1 for every time some dude uttered “if you really loved me you’d…”. I’d be frickin rich.
Crossover to mainstream Hollywood, extremely unlikely. Although many of the male crew work both in mainstream film and porn, crossover is yet to be achieved by any female actor. In fact, it usually goes the other way – they cannot get mainstream parts, so the do porn in order to get money whilst they await the ‘big break’.
I hope she is able to recover from her experiences. Although I am not impressed with hocking the porn industry impressionable young girls and women. Or misrepresenting the porn industry.
I wish she would speak out about her experiences, even though she’d be dismisssed as having ‘Linda Boreman sydrome’, which is obviously pure bullshit.
Thank you Smash for succinctly proving – yes proving pornography harms women and is not ‘empowering’ as porn apologists claim.   Sadly Sasha Grey cannot bring herself to acknowledge she was subjected to horrific male sexual violence during her brief time working as a supposedly ‘porn star.’
Unfortunately the general reader will not recognise the double talk Grey has engaged in but will simply accept at face value Grey’s claims ‘she enjoyed her time in the porn industry.’  Furthermore her double talk will be used to reinforce men’s claims ‘porn is harmless male fantasy.’  Much will be made of her decision to leave porn for more lucrative employment and her experiences will be dismissed as ‘just an unfortunate incident’ because it is essential claims pornography industry is ‘empowering to women’ must not be debunked.
However, having an awareness of how pornography industry and its apologists always twist women’s realities into lies is a vital tool in our never-ending fight against the male created pornography industry and how this industry justifies and naturalises (sic) male domination over all women.
Hecuba, due to the Hollywood/porn crossover (crew, directors etc), of course she will say “enjoyed my time in it”. It is an industry of “who you know” more than anything. She might speak out eventually, if/when the Hollywood career does not materialise.
And yes, *quelle* *surprise*! at the fact that a woman abandoned porn once a better opportunity presented itself.
Porn pays well, that’s the bottom line. ANd women are discriminated against on purpose in the workplace so that will always be plenty of them available for porn. BUt they’re still not paid as well as the directors and middle-men! Women in porn should remember that!!!
Thanks all. The source link for the claim that she does “nearly all the acts available in pornography” is not working. Here is the source link I meant to use http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYs2YfNlRBg#t=04m44s It’s her manager saying she does “pretty much everything they do in this business”.
If you click on some of the source links, you’ll see a smart woman with a flat affect who seems very broken. It was difficult to write this article, because I feel so sad that the industry does this to women.
Traci Lords was attempting to go “legit” back in the early 90s when I worked with her on a film in which she was cast as *The French Maid* (surprise!) in what ended up being a terrible, straight-to-video comedy.  Her comedic timing is fabulous, by the way.
She would show up every day and be forced to endure the disgusting questions and *jokes* the crew had for her and, of course, she knew what they were saying behind her back.  They brought their copies of her porn videos and still spreads to the set and would try to get her to autograph them.  It was sickening and absolutely demoralizing.
i remember when roseanne barr tried to give traci lords a chance in the mainstream too.  it didnt take.  and yes, she was funny and a good actor.  she was also cast as the dumb blonde, the temptress/slut and they did a coda/piece at the end where roseanne, jackie and traci lords character were “sexxxay waitresses” porn actors on a porn set and end up servicing one of the customers at the diner.  or something, i dont remember.
as for sasha’s crossover, well, here shes trying to do “public service” which was volunteer and unpaid, last time i checked.  and she cannot escape her “past” even though its been 2 years since she left.  i hope she saved her money….
http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/15/ex-porn-star-sasha-grey-i-wont-stop-reading-to-kids/?iref=obnetwork
didnt they end up getting leon to clean the grease traps naked or something?  i dont remember.  i do remember the sexxxay waitresses porn thing, and that there was a twist at the end.  i guess it was supposed to be ironic or empowering or something, i dont know.
Marilyn Chambers also tried to have a career outside of porn: She was hired for a TV advert but it was pulled off the air after it was revealed that she had been a famous porn performer. She also starred in David Cronenberg’s “Rabid” as a women with a phallus-like stinger within her armpit which she uses to feed on the blood of men who then turn into zombies and infect others. The movie ends with a shot of her lifeless body beig picked up by a garbage truck. Considering her porn “career” the movie could not be any less creepy.
“I have to say that the adult films have been a total pleasure,” she said. “They were like getting paid to live out my greatest fantasies. The rest of the stuff … sometimes got to be a real grind.” (http://www.lvrj.com/news/breaking_news/42937007.html)
“In a 2004 interview, Chambers said “My advice to somebody who wants to go into adult films is: Absolutely not! It’s heart-breaking. It leaves you kind of empty. So have a day job and don’t quit it”. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Chambers)
That movie business idea didn’t even end up being incredibly lucrative for Jenna Jameson, did it? She probably earns her income mainly through working her porn star image.
It is interesting that Grey has been out of porn for two years, and is now able to allude to/admit that the pleasure in the films is faked. The women of the View ask her,
Now Grey didn’t exactly say, “I faked it!”. But we can tell just by watching the clip that she is agreeing that she faked pleasure. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f8k54IY4kg#t=04m38s
I wonder how much more honest she will be in a few years. Of course, it all depends on if she can find alternate employment.
thanks for this post, smash. Good lord, she’s only 21. If i were a praying woman, i’d pray for her to find peace. I’m not really a praying person, though. oh well, step up the activism then, I guess… Smash, it must have been difficult to write this. The cruelty this young woman endured is horrifying and enraging.
Thanks ER. It was actually very difficult to write. I feel so sad that she has had to absorb so much hatred and abuse in her young life. I also hope that she finds peace.
Smash, thank you for this true-life example of how men abusing, degrading and hating women in pornography is culturally normalized to require appeasement by women leaving the “industry” and still trying to please the captors/slave masters/colonizers of our bodies.  Compassion for women is in order, and sadness (you’re so right) that pornography victims absorb so much hatred and abuse from men but still believe they must keep smiling as if it never hurt.
Right now I’m living in a politically progressive part of CA (as least in patriarchal, male-defined terms “progressive”) and recently I’ve had conversations with younger, hetero-normative women (in their 20′s & 30′s) who are starting to find offensive the cruel tonality they hear in their male peers’ voices on topics about women, particularly when there’s a group of men.  These younger women blame internet pornography.
Also, these younger women “get it” that a guy interested just in seeing female nakedness or so-called “normal” PIV one-on-one male-on-female behavior are getting unsolicited online pop-ups to direct them away into gang rape depiction —  filmed with group-male so-called humor (“hahahaha — what we told her is the bathroom door for her cleanup is really the outlet to the street”) in the derisive turning out of sexually used, unclothed women onto the public street after the gang raping — and much worse.
It’s enough to make me wish the separatist women’s land movements for WBW open-land sanctuary as begun in the ’60′s and ’70′s had succeeded. (Patriarchy’s changing property tax and code requirements, etc., helped to defeat those movements.  Not too surprising.)  Even abused elephants get a sanctuary of their own in the USA.  But not us.
Smash, I am so appreciative of the amount of compassion you show for Grey in your writing. I doubt she will ever say what her experiences in the underworld of the filmed rape industry were really like, in large part because her name will always be connected to it.
I had no idea she was only 21, either. I know she has been an outspoken supporter of the filmed rape industry, but…gosh…that’s so young.
She’s 23 now, 21 when she decided she’d had enough.  3 whole years in the industry.  She’s left the INDUSTRY, not just a certain shitty job or a particularly bad employer.  This reveals a lot I think.  This doesn’t happen the same way in other industries.  Porn is not compatible with life for women, and its not sustainable.
Tragic that womon continue to defend the ‘rape industry’, despite how in the long term it will harm them big time…..
All this nonsense about ‘living out my greatest fantasies’, via porno. No not womons greatest fantasies here just the MENZ…..
Ms. Grey had a starring role on an HBO show “the entourage” where she played herself, basically.  She was the girlfriend of the main character and the show used her real life role as a way to discuss whether one should “date a porn star.”  I think this is what led her to leave the industry, she is dabbling in Hollywood roles and for her sake, I hope she makes it.
I don’t think anyone “chooses” porn as their lifetime goal or dream, it is used more as a stepping stone to what is really wanted.  Too bad women trying to make it in Hollywood have to use porn as an option to get their foot in the door.  I disagree with porn to the deepest depths, but I would never ostracize the women who make those choices.
  In every culture you control, from the distant past to the present day, in all parts of the world-you have hated us. 
Why do you kidnap girls and women and torture them to death in Juarez to make your twisted snuff porn?
Why have you thought of the idea of breaking our ankles to keep us from running away?  Why have you expected us to work without pay?
 Why did you bind our feet and cripple us for life in China for 1,000 years? Why did you force us to wear iron “chastity belts” making us unable to wash off our own excrement?
Why did you silence us with your invention “the scold’s bridle,” — an iron helmet with a piece of iron that was rammed into our bloodied mouths?  Why did you tie us to a long pole and immerse us under water until you drowned us? 
Why do you still require mothers to mutilate the sex organs of their daughters to make us “acceptable?”  
Why do you tell us we are inanimate objects that must pay to have our healthy bodies “sculpted” under your knives so we can fit your idea of “beauty?”
  Why have your priests sanctified the battering of our precious bodies with fists and endless childbearing?
 Why do you take our sons, and now, even our daughters and use them as weapons in your insane wars? 
Why do you deny us the right to decide whether or not to have children?  Why do you use us in your degrading porn industry?
Why have you colonized our bodies with brute force and our minds with your dysfunctional, psychopathic religions?
 Why do you pit us against each other with your “beauty” contests and treat us like prize farmed animals at the county fair?

Why? Is it because 6,000 years of battering, rapes, torture, femicide and cultural coercion was not enough to subdue us?
I think Sasha Grey suffers from a very serious ‘mind split’, i.e. PTSD-related mental fragmentation. When you think about this woman, please don’t forget the Melissa Farley quote I posted here once:
In order to survive the brutal violation of their flesh in the prostitution industries, womyn dissociate; they mentally diconnect from their reality (which is way too painful to admit for them) and they appear to be “enjoying” what they do, but they don’t, they really don’t.
I remember that Sasha Grey denied having been abused as a child (like most womyn who appear in porn were) but she sounded really nervous and defensive while she was denying it (it was on the Tyra Banks show, I think), so maybe she was denying another truth.
I definitely think she left pornstitution because she couldn’t cope with the degradation and the violence anymore.
Great post, Smash. The fact that she asked that guy to punch her at her first shoot suggests that she was hating herself somehow. Many rape survivors (wrongfully) hate themselves and think it was all their fault (rather than their abusers’). I think that this girl must have been raped when she was really young, just like Jenna Jameson and Tracy Lords, even if this one (Grey) won’t admit it, she still was…
I’ve been reading discussions of this article on a few feminist facebook sites, and so many of the responses are just so typical.
Lots of left wing doods trying to tell everyone that feminism is about “choice” and we shouldn’t deny sascha her “agency”.
Lots of privileged sex workers telling everyone not to “judge” their choices, as if the state of the porn and prostitution industries should be overlooked in favour of their “right” to “choose” to do what they want without being “judged” (they imagine they are being judged by the way, I think they are just narcissists who want to tell everyone their story, and for the debate to be all about them).
There’s just so much male + white woman sex-worker privilege in the responses to articles like these. Fortunately there are a few lone voices trying to explain the radfem view (including the page owners, who are as anti-porn and prostitution as we are) but they are being outnumbered.
Thanks for sharing those links PW. I’m not surprised that many are unwilling to see the context under which pornography is “chosen” (ie patriarchy). Challenging male power and access to women is not a popular action, but it is necessary. We will keep speaking the truth.

“Most of the triple X I see is boring and does not arouse me physically or visually. I am determined and ready to be a commodity that fulfills everyone’s fantasies.” - Sasha Grey
                One glance at Sasha Grey's innocent face leaves you wondering if she's simply a deer lost in the headlights of the porn industry. Upon further examination, she might very well be the one driving the car. A lone artist who breathes in a world of preconceived sexploitation, the existential Sasha Grey is swiftly and surely blurring the lines between artistic adult and mainstream entertainment.            
                Coined by Rolling Stone as "the dirtiest girl in the world," Sasha Grey has done virtually anything and everything that there is to be done sexually in front of the camera. A veteran of the adult film industry at the age of 21, she has also scoffed at offers to "enhance" her looks via cosmetic surgery. In keeping her body natural, she has allowed herself to blossom into a true celebrity beauty, whether she's in Hollywood or Porn Valley.  Sasha Grey's knowledge and experience might make her the most engaging partner a guy could ever have, but her list of kinks are also enough to scare a lot of men away. After all, this is a girl who includes slapping, hair-pulling and smacks on her regular to-do list. Some men might feel the need to rescue this beauty from the rigors of her work, but make no mistake about it, Sasha Grey is convinced that she is calling the shots and she wants her on-camera sex no other way. While discussing her sexcapades for a feature in Los Angeles magazine, she said: "I guess I've just been blessed."            
                If you like your movies down and dirty, you already know Sasha Grey from over 160 skin flicks with names like Bullets & Burlesque and Sasha Grey's Anatomy. Otherwise, you might be wondering what the fuss is all about. A young entry into the adult entertainment world, Grey has all but conquered the industry in a very short period -- having already earned accolades like the Adult Video News Performer of the Year Award and a Penthouse Pet of the Month nod all before her 21st birthday.  It would be unfair to classify Sasha Grey as just a "porn star." In her quest for artistic legitimacy, she has extended her visibility into mainstream films like Smash Cut, Quilt and, most notably, The Girlfriend Experience. She's also a working model, an active documentary filmmaker and a musician. With an equal share of supporters (Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh) and detractors (radio shock jock Howard Stern), Sasha Grey's success is indisputable when you consider the fact that she has everyone talking about her.            
                Sasha Grey's early life was similar to other women who ended up in the skin biz, but her formative years were also defined by an artistic awakening that would ultimately be her guiding light. Raised in Sacramento, she came from a broken family, and a life of near-poverty meant that simple childhood activities like watching movies with friends or going shopping were out of the question. Nevertheless, Grey came to enjoy acting, and she started taking lessons early on and continued to do so for a decade.  After high school, Sasha Grey moved out and worked at a steak restaurant during a year that changed her intellectually -- and bend her physically -- in a myriad of ways. Through a series of college arts classes and her own interest, she was introduced to the cinema of French director Jean-Luc Godard, the novels of Hunter S. Thompson and the music of David Bowie -- all of which gave her an existential take on life. In addition, she entered a heated sexual relationship with a coworker who initiated her into sexual activities that were highly questionable and surprisingly enjoyable! It left her curious about whether she could have sex professionally, in addition to personally.
Just a few weeks past her 18th birthday in 2006, the newly single, forever-existential and brazenly sexual Sasha Grey moved to Los Angeles with her eyes peeled on entering the adult industry. Living in a house without an air conditioner or a proper kitchen, she found agent Mark Spiegler through the internet and filmed her first scene in Fashionistas Safado: The Challenge for director John Stagliano. Although Stagliano was a veteran of the business, he and Grey's scene partner, Rocco Siffredi, were unprepared for what happened next. In the heat of the moment, Grey asked the male talent to punch her in the stomach, to which he refused. The incident rippled across the industry and left everyone pondering who this young woman was -- and why she wanted a tummy ache.  Sasha Grey finished her first year in the adult film industry $200,000 richer with an award from the X-Rated Critics' Organization for Best New Starlet. It was only the beginning. In three years, Grey would make over 100 adult movies, pose as a Penthouse Pet of the Month, open her own L.A. Factory Girls agency, and be named 2008's Female Performer of the Year, according to both XRCO and the Adult Video News. Why so successful? Some of it was her willingness to look at the camera and "connect" with viewers, and a big part of it was her flat-out fearlessness about what she would do on camera. While some (like Tyra Banks) cried degradation, Sasha Grey cried feminism and argued that it was her idea!
In 2008, Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh was in the early stages of a new film called The Girlfriend Experience, about a high-class call girl in New York City. One of his assistants contacted Sasha Grey through her MySpace account, but she thought the message was a hoax, until the director himself called her the next day. Impressed with her stated desire to try "regular" acting, Soderbergh cast her and the film was screened at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. While additional roles followed in the horror-comedy Smash Cut and the drama Quit, Grey hopes to restrict her non-adult acting to independent films -- in keeping with her tastes.  Sasha Grey has also found work in modeling for American Apparel, and in music with her own industrial music group, ATelecine. As if she wasn't busy enough, she managed to pick a fight with Howard Stern, calling him a "closet racist" in Rolling Stone. The dig was not kindly received and sparked a war of words that only added to her popularity. Now engaged to photographer Ian Cinnamon, Grey will soon offer up a new project that promises to be even more revealing than her already bare past: her own documentary about the three years since her 18th birthday. Tsk… tsk… and you thought there was nothing left of her to see!
In May 2010, Entourage creator Doug Ellin cast Sasha Grey in his show as Vincent Chase's (Adrian Grenier) love interest. The plot of their love story was allegedly be based on Charlie Sheen's affair with Ginger Lynn in the late '90s. Sasha Grey had a recurring role on Entourage for that season. 
As of late 2011, it's been a full two years since Sasha Grey last appeared in an adult movie. She's stated that she's focusing on mainstream movies and modeling now. In keeping with her move toward the non-naked realm, she recently has been reading to grade-school kids as part of the Read Across America literacy program. Unfortunately, some of the kids' parents are none too pleased about it. In mid-November 2011, Grey had to release a statement defending her involvement with the program. No word yet whether or not she'll be able to continue reading to kids.

 • Adult Film Star Sasha Grey Causes A Stir By Reading To Elementary School Children; Says She'll Do It Again
Biography:An enigmatic and alluring adult film star, Sasha Grey achieved mainstream crossover, thanks to her intelligence and one-of-a-kind mystique. Born March 14, 1988 in North Highlands, CA, Marina Ann Hantzis was attending college and waiting tables when she decided to break into the adult film industry, adopting the name "Sasha Grey."

Sasha Grey, Entourage, James Deen, James Deen Movies, James Deen Porn, James Deen Sasha Grey, James Deen The Canyons, Sasha Grey Acting, Sasha Grey Entourage, Sasha Grey Movies,
James Deen and Sasha Grey have two things in common: They've both been porn stars and have done at least one non-porn movie. But that's apparently where the similarities end. 
In a new Vulture interview off his promotional run for "The Canyons," in which Deen stars opposite Lindsay Lohan, the porn star reveals that Grey is sort of the Voldemort of the porn industry. "That’s, like, the name that is not said in this business," he said. "I don’t have anything against her, but in the adult-film world she has a very bad reputation for many reasons. The reality is that she was 18 when she started doing porn and between 18 and 23 her goals changed, and she wants to do different things now."
Grey has left pornography and seemingly severed all ties with the industry, while Deen has been adamant that his "Canyons" role is in no way an attempt to quit getting paid to have sex on camera (he even told Vulture that he still enjoys working seven days a week). That Grey -- who has acted in "The Girlfriend Experience" and "Would You Rather" -- was no longer interested in porn is hardly new information, but Deen offered an interesting if unconfirmed tidbit about just how far she was willing to go to make that happen:
Actually, my ex-girlfriend and her have the same manager, and her manager dropped her because in the "Entourage" meeting, apparently she had this whole freakout about how porn ruined her life. The second they left the meeting, in the elevator, she was like, “I think I’ll get the part now.” And the manager was like, “Are you serious? You just said that porn ruined your life and you’re just laughing about it now? What was that, fake?” You know, when she was 18, she wanted to be Belladonna, and she pushed the envelope and got dirty and nasty and all of this stuff, and then she wanted to be like Jenna Jameson and be glamorous, and then she wanted to do acting.
On "Entourage," Grey played Vincent Chase (Adrien Grenier)'s girlfriend for a season-long arc. She essentially played a variation of herself, a Sasha Grey who was doing her best to leave porn.

Sasha Grey (born Marina Ann Hantzis, on March 14, 1988, in North Highlands, California) is an award-winning American pornographic actress. A. O. Scott of The New York Times described her pornographic career as "distinguished both by the extremity of what she is willing to do and an unusual degree of intellectual seriousness about doing it." She is also active outside of pornography through modeling, acting, and music.
Grey was born and raised in North Highlands, California, to a working class family. Her mother worked for the state of California and her father is a mechanic. Her ancestry includes Greek, Irish, English, and Polish. Her parents divorced when she was 5 and subsequently she was raised by her mother, who remarried in 2000. She's stated that while her parents hated her involvement in the adult industry, they get along.Grey attended four high schools, among them Highlands High, before graduating, having been unhappy in each one, though she graduated a year early at 17. In late 2005, she attended junior college and took classes in film, dance, and acting. She waited tables at a steakhouse through March 2006 and saved $7,000 for a move to Los Angeles.
In May 2006, Grey moved to Los Angeles and started her career in adult films just after turning 18. Originally she toyed with the name Anna Karina, taken after the French New Wave actress, before deciding on her present name. The name "Sasha" was taken from Sascha Konietzko of the band KMFDM, and "Grey" represents Oscar Wilde’s novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. Her first scene was an orgy with Rocco Siffredi for The Fashionistas 2 by John Stagliano.Grey quickly made a name for herself in the business after she asked Siffredi to punch her in the stomach, however, she later stated that she was improvising and it was taken out of context Less than six months after entering the adult industry, Grey was featured in the November 2006 edition of Los Angeles where she was flagged as a potential major star, perhaps the next Jenna Jameson. In December 2006, Grey was interviewed on the syndicated entertainment industry news show The Insider.Sasha Grey attending the AVN Awards Show at the Palms Casino Resort, Las Vegas, Nevada on January 9, 2010In February 2007, she appeared on The Tyra Banks Show, discussing teenagers in the sex industry. There was speculation that the show was heavily manipulated through editing, and did not include her defense of pornography as a career choice. The show was also criticized for twisting Grey's depiction to increase its dramatic value. In January 2007, Grey was the recipient of awards for "Best Three Way Sex Scene" and "Best Group Scene" at the AVN Adult Movie Awards. She was also nominated as "Best New Starlet", but lost to Naomi. Grey was named Pet of The Month for July 2007 and was photographed by fashion photographer Terry Richardson.In 2008, she became the youngest person to win the AVN "Female Performer of the Year" award as well as "Best Oral Sex Scene" for a scene. Grey was profiled in the Rolling Stone "Hot Issue" for the December 2008 edition. Grey formerly represented herself in the adult industry through her own agency, L.A. Factory Girls. Grey has indicated particular appreciation for the work of Andrew Blake and Kimberly Kane. A. O. Scott of The New York Times described her pornographic career as "distinguished both by the extremity of what she is willing to do and an unusual degree of intellectual seriousness about doing it."In 2011, she was named by CNBC as one of the 12 most popular stars in porn. CNBC noted that, while she is no longer acting in porn films, her current mainstream roles have kept interest in her earlier porn work high, and several companies continue to release compilations of her earlier work. Grey filmed her last pornographic film at age 21, although she did not announce her retirement for some time after, realizing that many of her fans still believed her to be an active performer in the industry. On April 8, 2011, she officially announced her retirement from adult films on Facebook.
She has modeled for French fashion designer Max Azria's ready to wear line Manoukian, Italian footwear brand Forfex for an international campaign, and American Apparel. She's modeled for Richard Kern as a part of Vice magazine's anti-fashion layout, and appeared in a three-part VBS program, "Shot by Kern". She also appeared in Taschen’s 25th anniversary reprint of Terry Richardson’s Terryworld. Among other collaborations with Richardson, she has also appeared in Wives, Wheels, Weapons, a companion book to James Frey's Bright Shiny Morning. She has also modeled for artists James Jean, Frédéric Poincelet, Zak Smith, and David Choe.Grey has appeared in Playboy Magazine twice, once for a December 2009 pictorial, as well as the cover feature in October 2010. In January 2010, Grey appeared nude in an ad campaign for PETA advocating animal birth control.[42] In February 2010, Grey stated in a PETA interview, "I think spaying and neutering is incredibly important. … [I]t keeps the animals out of the shelters, and there's too many unwanted animals out there already".Grey appeared in an episode of James Gunn's PG Porn with James Gunn, as well as a cameo role[45] in Dick Rude's independent film Quit, and stars in[46] the 2009 Canadian low-budget black comedy/horror film Smash Cut from the Ottawa-based Odessa/Zed Filmworks. She plays a TV news personality who goes undercover as an actress in a horror film production, only to discover her older sister's murderer. In March 2010, Grey was cast as an anti-sex Christian in the horror film Hallows, directed by Richard O'Sullivan.Grey played the lead role, "Chelsea", an escort girl who is paid to act as the clients' girlfriend, in Academy Award-winning director Steven Soderbergh's film The Girlfriend Experience. Soderbergh cast her after reading the article profiling her in Los Angeles magazine, commenting that "She's kind of a new breed, I think. She doesn't really fit the typical mold of someone who goes into the adult film business...I'd never heard anybody talk about the business the way that she talked about it." In having Grey prepare for her role in The Girlfriend Experience, Soderbergh asked her to watch Godard's Vivre sa vie and Pierrot le fou. Vivre sa vie concerns prostitution, while the relationship portrayed in Pierrot le fou was suggested as a model for the dynamic between Chelsea and her boyfriend and clients. Grey and Soderbergh also interviewed two escorts, and borrowed character traits and behavior from them.[ Critics had mixed assessments of Grey's performance.Grey was cast for the seventh season of the HBO show Entourage, where she played a fictionalized version of herself. Her character was Vincent Chase's new girlfriend in a multi-episode arc. Grey co-starred alongside Thomas Jane, Carla Gugino, Jeremy Piven, and Rob Lowe in the thriller I Melt With You which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2011. She then starred in the lead role in the Indonesian film Shrouded Corpse Bathing While Hip-Shaking. The film premiered in Indonesia on April 28, 2011. She subsequently starred in the lead role in the French film Life, which was released on DVD in France on August 10, 2011, and voiced the character Viola in the 2011 video game Saints Row: The Third, which was released in November 2011.In February of that same year, she appeared in the music video for Eminem's song "Space Bound". Grey plays the role of Eminem's girlfriend, whom Eminem strangles only to realize she is just a figment of his imagination. The video was premiered on Vevo on June 27, 2011. Previously, she appeared in the music video for the 2008 song "Birthday Girl" by The Roots. She also is featured in the artwork for The Smashing Pumpkins 2007 album Zeitgeist and appears in the music video for their song "Superchrist".In 2008, Grey began an industrial music collaboration, called aTelecine, with Pablo St. Francis. They have since added members Anthony D' Juan and Ian C. Their first EP, aVigillant Carpark, was released in 2009 by New York label Pendu Sound in 7 inch vinyl only. Grey also contributed vocals to the Current 93 album Aleph at Hallucinatory Mountain. She also regularly performs as a DJ in the US and Canada. In 2010, aTelecine released their first LP, ...And Six Dark Hours Pass, and in November of the same year followed it up with the LP A Cassette Tape Culture. In August 9, 2011, aTelecine's first full length album, The Falcon and the Pod, was released; this album is the first of a planned trilogy.Sasha Grey is also listed by Narnack Records website as a guest artist on Repentance,[69] the 54th studio album by Grammy-winning reggae and dub icon Lee "Scratch" Perry, though Perry himself denied her involvement in a 2009 interview.Grey's first photo book, Neü Sex, was released on March 29, 2011.Since 2006, she has been developing an autobiographical documentary, illustrating her experiences from the age of 18 to 21. She was reported in a Rolling Stone interview in 2009 as being engaged to filmmaker Ian Cinnamon. Grey identifies as bisexual. She has also stated she is an atheist.In November 2011, Grey participated in the Guest Reading Program at Emerson Elementary School in Compton, California. Reportedly her involvement in such activity was first denied by school officials. She had not appeared on the guest list under her stage name of 'Sasha Grey', but under her real name. Some parents were upset that a former pornographic actress would read to their children as part of an education program; Grey responded to the controversy: "I believe education is a universal right. I committed to this program with the understanding that people would have their own opinions about what I have done, who I am and what I represent." Grey also appeared on the American talk show The View where she explained that she thought the parents ought to have been given prior notice of the identity of anyone who did guest reading, and that if parents had objected to her she would not have done it.
