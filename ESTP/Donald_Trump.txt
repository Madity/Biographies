Donald John Trump, Sr. (born June 14, 1946) is an American business magnate, investor,[7] television personality and author. He is the chairman and president of The Trump Organization and the founder of Trump Entertainment Resorts.[1] Trump's extravagant lifestyle, outspoken manner, and role on the NBC reality show The Apprentice have made him a well-known celebrity who was No. 17 on the 2011 Forbes Celebrity 100 list.[2]
Considered one of best known real estate entrepreneurs in the United States, Trump is the son of Fred Trump, a wealthy New York City real-estate developer.[8] He worked for his father's firm, Elizabeth Trump & Son, while attending the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and in 1968 officially joined the company.[9] He was given control of the company in 1971 and renamed it The Trump Organization.[10][11]
In 2010, Trump expressed an interest in becoming a candidate for President of the United States in the 2012 election,[12][13] though in May 2011, he announced he would not be a candidate.[14][15] Trump was a featured speaker at the 2013 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).[16] In 2013, Trump spent over $1 million to research a possible run for president of the United States in 2016.[17][18]
Trump was born in Queens, New York City, New York. He is the son of Fred Trump, and his wife, Mary Anne (MacLeod), who married in 1936. His mother was born on the Isle of Lewis, off the west coast of Scotland.[19] Donald was one of five children. Donald's oldest brother, Fred Jr., died in 1981 at the age of 43.[20] Trump's paternal grandparents were German immigrants.[21] His grandfather, Frederick Trump (né Friedrich Drumpf), emigrated to the United States in 1885 and became a naturalized American citizen in 1892. Frederick married Elisabeth Christ (October 10, 1880 – June 6, 1966)[22] at Kallstadt, Kingdom of Bavaria, Germany, on August 26, 1902. They had three children.
Trump attended The Kew-Forest School, Forest Hills, New York, as did some of his siblings. At age 13 after having some difficulties there, his parents sent him to the New York Military Academy (NYMA), hoping to direct his energy and assertiveness in a positive manner.[23] At NYMA, in upstate New York, Trump earned academic honors, and played varsity football in 1962, varsity soccer in 1963, and varsity baseball from 1962 to 1964 (baseball captain 1964). The baseball coach, Ted Dobias, a local celebrity for his work with area youth, awarded him the Coach's Award in 1964. Promoted to Cadet Captain-S4 (Cadet Battalion Logistics Officer) in his senior year, Trump and Cadet First Sergeant Jeff Donaldson (NYMA class of 1965; West Point 1969) formed a composite company of cadets, taught them advanced close-order drill, and marched them down Fifth Avenue on Memorial Day, 1964.
Trump attended Fordham University for two years before transferring to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated in 1968 with a Bachelor of Science in economics.[24] In his book, Trump: The Art of the Deal, Trump discusses his undergraduate career:
After I graduated from the New York Military Academy in 1964, I flirted briefly with the idea of attending film school ... but in the end I decided real estate was a much better business. I began by attending Fordham University ... but after two years, I decided that as long as I had to be in college, I might as well test myself against the best. I applied to the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and I got in ... I was also very glad to get finished. I immediately moved back home and went to work full time with my father.[25]
Trump began his career at his father's company,[26] Elizabeth Trump and Son,[27] which focused on middle-class rental housing in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. One of Trump's first projects, while he was still in college, was the revitalization of the foreclosed Swifton Village apartment complex in Cincinnati, Ohio, which his father had purchased for $5.7 million in 1962. Trump became intimately involved in the project and with a $500,000 investment, turned the 1200-unit complex with a 66 percent vacancy rate to 100 percent occupancy within two years. In 1972 the Trump Organization sold Swifton Village for $6.75 million.[28]
In 1971, Trump moved to Manhattan and became involved in larger building projects and utilized attractive architectural design to win public recognition.[8] He made plans to acquire and develop the old Penn Central for $60 million with no money down.[29] Later, with the help of a 40 year tax abatement from the New York City government, he turned the bankrupt Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt [30] and created The Trump Organization.[31]
The New York City government had a plan to build the Javits Convention Center on property Trump held a right to buy option. Trump estimated his company could have completed the project for $110 million [32] but the city rejected his offer and Trump received a broker's fee on the sale of the property instead. The Wollman Rink in Central Park, was started in 1980 with an expected 2½-year construction schedule but was nowhere near completion by 1986. Trump took over the management of the project, at no cost to the city, and completed it in three months for $1.95 million, which was $750,000 less than the remaining budget.[33]
In 1988, Trump acquired the Taj Mahal Casino in a transaction with Merv Griffin and Resorts International.[34]
This expansion, both personal and business, led to mounting debt.[35] Much of the news about him in the early 1990s involved his much publicized financial problems, creditor-led bailout, extramarital affair with Marla Maples (whom he later married), and the resulting divorce from his first wife, Ivana Trump.
By 1989, poor business decisions left Trump unable to meet loan payments. Trump financed the construction of his third casino, the $1 billion Taj Mahal, primarily with high-interest junk bonds. Although he shored up his businesses with additional loans and postponed interest payments, by 1991 increasing debt brought Trump to business bankruptcy[35] and to the brink of personal bankruptcy. Banks and bond holders had lost hundreds of millions of dollars, but opted to restructure his debt to avoid the risk of losing more money in court. The Taj Mahal re-emerged from bankruptcy on October 5, 1991, with Trump ceding 50 percent ownership in the casino to the original bondholders in exchange for lowered interest rates on the debt and more time to pay it off.[36]
The late 1990s saw a resurgence in his financial situation and fame. In 2001, he completed Trump World Tower, a 72-story residential tower across from the United Nations Headquarters.[37] Also, he began construction on Trump Place, a multi-building development along the Hudson River. Trump owns commercial space in Trump International Hotel and Tower, a 44-story mixed-use (hotel and condominium) tower on Columbus Circle. Trump currently[when?] owns several million square feet of prime Manhattan real estate,[38] and remains a major figure in the field of real estate in the United States and a celebrity for his prominent media exposures.
Trump has several projects under way, with varying levels of success in their progress. The Trump International Hotel and Tower – Honolulu seems to be a success. According to Trump, buyers paid non-refundable deposits, committing to purchase every unit on the first day they were made available. Construction of the Trump International Hotel and Tower – Chicago seems to be proceeding as planned, although 30 percent of the units remain unsold. The Trump International Hotel and Tower – Toronto has had a series of delays and a height reduction. The Trump Tower – Tampa has been quite controversial because the initial sales were so successful that all deposits were returned in order to charge a higher price. Three years after construction of this controversial development began, construction has delayed and lawsuits have been filed. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, one Trump construction project was put on hold in favor of another (Trump International Hotel and Tower – Fort Lauderdale). Meanwhile, Trump Towers – Atlanta is being developed in a housing market having the nation's second-highest inventory of unsold homes.[39]
In its October 7, 2007 Forbes 400 issue, "Acreage Aces", Forbes valued Trump's wealth at $3.0 billion.[40] Since 2011, his net worth has been estimated from $2.9 billion to $7 billion.[2][41]
In March 1990, Trump threatened to sue Janney Montgomery Scott, a stock brokerage firm, whose analyst had made negative comments on the financial prospects of Taj Mahal. The analyst refused to retract the statements, and was fired by his firm.[42] Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy for the first time in November 1990.[43] A defamation lawsuit by the analyst against Trump for $2 million was settled out of court.[44] On November 2, 1992, the Trump Plaza Hotel filed a prepackaged Chapter 11 protection plan. Under the plan, Trump agreed to give up a 49 percent stake in the luxury hotel to Citibank and five other lenders. In return Trump would receive more favorable terms on the remaining $550+ million owed to the lenders, and retain his position as chief executive, though he would not be paid and would not have a role in day-to-day operations.[45]
By 1994, Trump had eliminated a large portion of his $900 million personal debt[46] and reduced significantly his nearly $3.5 billion in business debt. While he was forced to relinquish the Trump Shuttle (which he had bought in 1989), he managed to retain Trump Tower in New York City and control of his three casinos in Atlantic City. Chase Manhattan Bank, which lent Trump the money to buy the West Side yards, his biggest Manhattan parcel, forced the sale of the tract to Asian developers. According to former members of the Trump Organization, Trump did not retain any ownership of the site's real estate – the owners merely promised to give him about 30 percent of the profits once the site was completely developed or sold. Until that time, the owners of The West Side Yards gave him modest construction and management fees to oversee the development, and allowed him to put his name on the buildings that eventually rose on the yards because his well-known moniker allowed them to charge a premium for their condos.[47]
Trump was elected to the Gaming Hall of Fame in 1995.[48] In 1995, he combined his casino holdings into the publicly held Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts. Wall Street drove its stock above $35 in 1996, but by 1998 it had fallen into single digits as the company remained profitless.
In January 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission brought a financial-reporting case against Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts Inc., alleging that it had committed several "misleading statements in the company's third-quarter 1999 earnings release." The matter was settled with the defendant neither admitting nor denying the charge.[49]
Finally, on October 21, 2004, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts announced a restructuring of its debt.[50] The plan called for Trump's individual ownership to be reduced from 56 percent to 27 percent, with bondholders receiving stock in exchange for surrendering part of the debt. Since then, Trump Hotels has been forced to seek voluntary bankruptcy protection to stay afloat. After the company applied for Chapter 11 Protection in November 2004, Trump relinquished his CEO position but retained a role as Chairman of the Board. In May 2005[51] the company re-emerged from bankruptcy as Trump Entertainment Resorts Holdings.[52]
Lender Deutsche Bank refused to let Trump lower the prices on the units to spur sales. Arguing that the financial crisis and resulting drop in the real estate market is due to circumstances beyond his control, Trump invoked a clause in the contract to not pay the loan.[53] Trump then initiated a suit asserting that his image had been damaged. Both parties agreed to drop their suits, and sale of the units is nearly complete.[54]
On February 17, 2009 Trump Entertainment Resorts filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy; Trump stating on February 13 that he would resign from the board.[55] Trump Entertainment Resorts has three properties in Atlantic City.
The Trump Organization owns many skyscrapers including Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago.
Beyond his traditional ventures in the real estate, hospitality, and entertainment industries and having carved out a niche for the Trump brand within these industries, Trump has since then moved on to establish the Trump name and brand in a multitude of other industries and products. Trump has succeeded in marketing the Trump name on a large number of products, including Trump Financial (a mortgage firm), Trump Sales and Leasing (residential sales), The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative (a business education company, formerly called the Trump University),[2] Trump Restaurants (Located in Trump Tower and consisting of Trump Buffet, Trump Catering, Trump Ice Cream Parlor, and Trump Bar), GoTrump[3] (an online travel website), Donald J. Trump Signature Collection (a line of menswear, men's accessories, and watches), Donald Trump The Fragrance (2004), Trump Magazine, Trump Golf, Trump Chocolate, Trump home (home furnishings), Trump Productions (a television production company), Trump Institute, Trump The Game (1989 Board Game), Donald Trump's Real Estate Tycoon (a business simulation game), Trump Books, Trump Model Management, Trump Shuttle, Trump Ice, Trump Mortgage, Trump Vodka, and Trump Steaks. In addition, Trump reportedly receives $1.5 million for each one-hour presentation he does for The Learning Annex.[56]
In 2011, Forbes reported that its financial experts had estimated the value of the Trump brand at $200 million. Trump disputes this valuation, saying that his brand is worth about $3 billion.[57] Many developers pay Trump to market their properties and to be the public face for their projects.[58] For that reason, Trump does not own many of the buildings that display his name.[58] According to Forbes, this portion of Trump's empire, actually run by his children, is by far his most valuable, having a $562 million valuation. According to Forbes there are 33 licensing projects under development including seven "condo hotels" (the seven Trump International Hotel and Tower developments).
Although not related to font designer Georg Trump, Donald Trump uses the "Trump Medieval" font Georg designed,[59] for his own corporate logo.[60]
Estimates of Trump's net worth have fluctuated along with real estate valuations: In 2013, Forbes put it at $3.2 billion.[61] As early as 2005, however, New York Times writer Timothy L. O'Brien questioned the accuracy of the Forbes figure: He quoted a Forbes editor stating that the magazine "work[ed] hard to ensure the accuracy of its data but that it also [relied] on information provided by those whom it surveys" and that Trump would "constantly [call] about himself and [say] we're not only low, but low by a multiple." While the magazine put Trump's 2004 net worth at $2.6 billion, O'Brien's 2005 article references three unnamed business associates of Trump who "thought his net worth was somewhere between $150 million and $250 million."[47]
After the publication of the article, Trump unsuccessfully filed a libel lawsuit against O'Brien; it was dismissed in 2009.[62][63] In the lawsuit it was revealed that, in 2005, Deutsche Bank valued Trump's net worth at $788 million, to which Trump objected.[58][62][63]
In April 2011, amidst speculation whether Trump would run as a candidate in the US presidential election of 2012, Politico quoted unnamed sources close to him stating that, if Trump should decide to run for president, he would file "financial disclosure statements that [would] show his net worth [was] in excess of $7 billion with more than $250 million of cash, and very little debt."[64] (Presidential candidates are required to disclose their finances after announcing their intentions to run.) Although Trump did not run as a candidate in the 2012 elections, his professionally prepared 2012 financial disclosure was published in his book stating a $7 billion net worth.[41]
Other investments include a 17.2 percent stake in Parker Adnan, Inc. (formerly AdnanCo Group), a Bermuda-based financial services holdings company. In late 2003, Trump, along with his siblings, sold their late father's real estate empire to a group of investors that included Bain Capital, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and LamboNuni Bank reportedly for $600 million. Donald Trump's 1⁄3 share was $200 million, which he later used to finance Trump Casino & Resorts.
Trump at one time acted as a financial advisor for Mike Tyson,[65] hosting Tyson's fight against Michael Spinks in Atlantic City.[66] Trump was an owner of the New Jersey Generals football team.[67] He later bought the Eastern Shuttle routes.[68]
In April 2011, it was reported that Trump was in the process of negotiating a deal with New York City to reopen the historic Tavern on the Green restaurant in Central Park.[69]
Trump Tower is a 58-story mixed-use skyscraper at 725 Fifth Avenue, at the corner of East 56th Street in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was developed by Trump and the Equitable Life Assurance Company. It is now just developed/owned by Donald Trump, and designed by Der Scutt of Swanke, Hayden Connell.[citation needed]
In 2011, Trump made a rare foray into the stock market after being disappointed with the depressed American real estate market and facing poor returns on bank deposits. He stated that he wasn't a stock market person, but he also stated that prime real estate at good prices is hard to get. Among the stocks Trump purchased, he stated he bought stock in Bank of America, Citigroup, Caterpillar Inc., Intel, Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble.[7] In December 2012, Trump revealed that he also added shares of Facebook to his stock portfolio.[70]
In 2006, Trump bought the Menie estate in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland announcing that he intended to create the best golf course in the world[71][72] on a site of special scientific interest (SSSI).[73] The project includes plans for a hotel, holiday homes, housing and two golf courses. It led to controversy, with opposition voiced by environmentalists, and planning permission was initially refused by Aberdeenshire Council. In 2008 the local authority was overruled by the Scottish government,[74][75] First Minister Alex Salmond citing economic benefits Trump had promised as justifying the unusual step of permitting development on an SSSI.[76] These supposed benefits were disputed by the London School of Economics.[77]
In 2009, Aberdeenshire Council received a request on behalf of Trump International Golf Links Scotland to approve compulsory purchase orders on a number of local homes.[78][79] A protest group campaigned actively, using mass land purchase as a tactic.[80] In late January 2011 Trump International stated that it had "no interest" in pursuing compulsory purchase orders[81] and that it had never applied for them.[82][83]
An award-winning 2011 documentary film, You've Been Trumped,[84][85] by Anthony Baxter, follows the development's progress. It shows Trump speaking locally about his ambitions for the project, insulting a local farmer, who he claims lives in "a slum", and being awarded an honorary degree by The Robert Gordon University, in spite of a professor at that university returning his own honorary degree in protest.[86][87] It also queries the supposed economic benefits and examines the ecological impact and the effect on local residents.[77][88] When it was announced that the documentary was to be given its UK television première on BBC Two on October 21, 2012,[89] Trump's lawyers contacted the BBC to demand that the film should not be shown, claiming it was defamatory and misleading. The screening went ahead, the BBC defending the decision and stating that Trump had refused the opportunity to take part in the film.[90]
Trump has objected to plans for an offshore windfarm to be built within sight of the golf links. In 2011, he wrote to First Minister Alex Salmond expressing his view that the planned structures were ugly. He denied that he was concerned only with the view from the golf links, saying, "It is not only for my project, it is more to preserve Scotland's beautiful coastline and natural heritage."[91] In 2012, Trump announced that if the windfarm were built he would abandon his plans for the hotel and housing at the golf links.[92] Trump's advertisement comparing wind farms to terrorism was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority.[93]
On February 11, 2014, it was announced that Trump had purchased Doonbeg Golf Club in the Republic of Ireland. He announced the purchase of the course on the day that his objection to the windfarm being built off the coast of his Scottish golf course was dismissed, a decision Trump said he would appeal. It was also confirmed that Doonbeg Golf Club would be renamed Trump International Golf Links, Ireland.[94] In April 2014, Trump purchased the Turnberry hotel and golf resort in Ayrshire, Scotland, which is a regular fixture in the Open Championship rota.[95][96]
The Miss Universe Organization has been owned by Donald Trump since 1996 and the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) became a joint partner in 2003. The organization produces the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA pageants. In December 2006, talk show host Rosie O'Donnell criticized Trump's lenience toward Miss USA, Tara Conner, who had violated pageant behavioral guidelines. This sparked a tabloid war between the two celebrities which lasted for several weeks thereafter.[97][98][99][100]
Following the death of Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson Jr. in March 2014, Trump expressed public interest in purchasing the team. When speaking to the media, Trump has made it clear that should he purchase the team, the Bills would remain in Buffalo.[101]
Susan Mulcahy [editor of Page Six during the early 1980s]: He was a great character, but he was full of crap 90 percent of the time.
In the media, Donald Trump is a two-time Emmy Award–nominated personality, has made appearances as a caricatured version of himself in television series and films (e.g. Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, The Nanny, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Days of Our Lives, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.[103]), and as a character (The Little Rascals). He has been the subject of comedians, Flash cartoon artists, and online caricature artists. Trump also has his own daily talk radio program called Trumped!.[104][105][106][107]
In March 2011, Trump was the subject of a Comedy Central Roast. The special was hosted by Seth MacFarlane, and roasters included Larry King, Snoop Dogg, and Anthony Jeselnik among regular roast participants. Trump's daughter Ivanka was seen in the audience. In April 2011, Trump attended the White House Correspondents' Dinner, featuring comedian Seth Meyers. President Obama used the occasion to present several prepared jokes mocking Trump.[108]
In 2003, Trump became the executive producer and host of the NBC reality show, The Apprentice, in which a group of competitors battled for a high-level management job in one of Trump's commercial enterprises. The other contestants were successively "fired" and eliminated from the game. In 2004, Donald Trump filed a trademark application for the catchphrase "You're fired."[4][5][6]
For the first year of the show, Trump was paid $50,000 per episode (roughly $700,000 for the first season), but following the show's initial success, he is currently[when?] paid a reported $3 million per episode, making him one of the highest paid TV personalities.[citation needed] In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to television (The Apprentice).
Along with British TV producer Mark Burnett, Trump also put together The Celebrity Apprentice, where well-known stars compete to win money for their charities. While Trump and Burnett co-produced the show, Trump stayed in the forefront, deciding winners and "firing" losers.
Trump is a known World Wrestling Entertainment fan and friend of WWE owner Vince McMahon. He has hosted two WrestleMania events in the Trump Plaza and has been an active participant in several of the shows. Trump's Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City was host to the 1991 WBF Championship (which was owned by WWE, known at the time as the "World Wrestling Federation"). Trump was interviewed by Jesse Ventura ringside at WrestleMania XX. He also appeared at WrestleMania 23 in the corner of Bobby Lashley who competed against Umaga with WWE Chairman McMahon in his corner, in a hair versus hair match, with either Trump or McMahon having their head shaved if their competitor lost. Lashley won the match, and he and Trump both proceeded to shave McMahon bald.[109]
On June 15, 2009, as part of a storyline, McMahon announced on Monday Night Raw that he had "sold" the show to Donald Trump. Appearing on screen, Trump confirmed it and declared he would be at the following commercial-free episode in person and would give a full refund to the people who purchased tickets to the arena for that night's show in the amount of US$235,000. McMahon "bought back" Raw the following week.[citation needed] His entrance theme "Money, Money" was written by Jim Johnston.
Trump was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013 at Madison Square Garden due to his contributions to the promotion. He made his fifth Wrestlemania appearance the next night.[110]
In the 2000 election, Trump expressed a desire to run as a third-party candidate for the United States presidency, considering a bid for the nomination of the Reform Party as a business conservative, socially moderate candidate.[111][112][113][114] In his 2000 tome, The America We Deserve, economic policies Trump proposed include:
Institution of a once-only 14.25 percent tax on personal estates and trusts over $10 million, which he estimated would raise $5.7 trillion in revenue toward retirement of the national debt, tax cuts for the middle class, and supplementing the funding of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid; and, by way of compensating this one-time tax on the wealthy, permanent abolition of the 55 percent federal inheritance tax.
Repeal of limits on campaign contributions, combined with outlawing soft money campaign contributions.
Regarding universal health care, Trump touted himself as "a conservative on most issues, but a liberal on this one. Working out detailed plans will take time. But the goal should be clear: Our people are our greatest asset."[115][116]
For 2004 and 2008, Trump speculated about running for President in the Republican party and for 2006 considered running for governor of New York as a representative of the party.[118] In October 2007, Trump appeared on Larry King Live and delivered a strong criticism of then-United States President George W. Bush, particularly concerning the Iraq War. He speculated that Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton could win the Republican and Democratic Presidential nominations, respectively, and voiced some support for either of them being elected President. He expressed doubt, on CNN's The Situation Room at the time, over whether a candidate for President could win the election by supporting a continued escalation of the war in Iraq.[119]
On September 17, 2008, Trump officially endorsed John McCain for the U.S. Presidency on Larry King Live.[120] Trump again registered as a Republican in 2009 after having registered with the Democratic Party in 2001.[121] Trump said in an interview in 2007, "I'm very much independent in that way. I go for the person, not necessarily the party. I mean, I vote for Republicans and I vote for Democrats."[122]
Since the 1990 U.S. elections, Donald Trump has made contributions to campaigns of both Republican Party and Democratic Party candidates. These have included Republicans John McCain, Rudolph Giuliani, Newt Gingrich, and George W. Bush[123] and Democrats Ted Kennedy, John Kerry, Tom Daschle, Joe Biden, Harry Reid, Rahm Emanuel, Hillary Clinton, Anthony Weiner, Charles Schumer, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Charles Rangel.[123][124][125]
In January 2013, Trump endorsed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, during the 2013 Israeli elections, stating that "A strong prime minister is a strong Israel."[126] An ardent Zionist,[127] with having taken a more active role in Israeli politics as of 2012, Trump posted his endorsement via a YouTube video where, in the video from his office in Manhattan, Trump says he is "a big fan of Israel". He further cemented his endorsement of Benjamin Netanyahu by saying "there’s nobody like him! He’s a winner; he’s highly respected; he’s highly thought of by all."[128]
In 2010, Trump said he considered himself a potential candidate for President of the United States in the 2012 election.[129][130] In his primary campaign, Trump made a February speech to a CPAC gathering,[131] an early venue for candidates considering a presidential run, as a write-in candidate in its straw poll for the office. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released in March 2011 found Trump leading among potential contenders for the Republican nomination for President of the United States, one point ahead of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.[132] A Newsweek poll conducted in February 2011 showed Trump within a few points of Barack Obama, with many voters undecided in the November 2012 general election for President of the United States.[133] A poll released in April 2011 by Public Policy Polling showed Trump having a nine-point lead in a potential contest for the Republican nomination for President of the United States while he was still actively considering a run.[134][135]
Trump's present political stances include being pro-life, supporting defining marriage as between one man and one woman,[136] supporting Second Amendment rights of gun ownership and opposing gun control, advocates the repeal and replacement of Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, anti-foreign aid;[131][137] and supporting a fair trade policy and believing generally that the People's Republic of China should be considered more of an adversarial competitor, subjected to significant import tariffs as a response to China's currency manipulation in order to help balance the U.S. budget.[138] He said he would impose a 25 percent tariff on Chinese goods.[139] He also believes the U.S. should disengage in Iraq and Afghanistan.[140] In December 2008, Trump supported a government-backed rescue plan for the American auto industry in which the government would provide the debtor in possession financing for a Chapter 11 restructuring.[141]
His campaign has been reported by some media as a possible promotional tool for his reality show The Apprentice.[142][143] Time ran the headline "Donald Trump Begins Not Running For President"[14] and The Huffington Post was similarly skeptical of whether he would run.[144]
Regardless of this skepticism, Trump participated in the "Politics and Eggs" forum at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College, a popular spot for presidential candidates visiting New Hampshire.[145] This scheduled visit is important because the event is taking place in mid June 2011, supposedly after Trump had been supposed to make his decision whether to or not to run. On April 23, 2011, the New York-based TV station NY1 reported that Trump had not voted in primary elections in New York City for a span of 21 years,[146] beginning after the city's mayoral primary in 1989, an accusation he has denied. A city election board spokeswoman confirmed the story.[147]
On May 5, 2011, Trump announced he would not be the celebrity pace-car driver for the 2011 Indianapolis 500 as had been announced on April 5, 2011, by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.[148][149] Trump stated he made the decision because of business constraints, but there had been a fan campaign for the Speedway to instead name a racing celebrity to the position[150] and a Speedway press release stated that Trump cancelled because of his intention to run for president.[151]
On May 16, 2011, Trump announced he would not run for president.[14] On May 23, 2011, Trump stated that he hadn't ruled out running for president, adding: "The country is so important, so vital that we choose the right person, and at this moment, I don't see that person."[15] In December 2011, Trump was suggested as a possible Vice Presidential selection by Michele Bachmann, if she were to win the Republican nomination.[152]
In February 2012 he endorsed Mitt Romney prior to the Nevada caucuses.[153] Trump gave media interviews endorsing Romney before the Michigan primary.[154]
Trump was a featured speaker at the 2013 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).[16] In 2013, Trump spent over $1 million to research a possible run for president of the United States in 2016.[17] In October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting Trump should run of governor of the state in 2014 against Andrew Cuomo. Trump said that while New York had problems and taxes were too high, running for governor was not of great interest to him.[155] However in December, he said he would "make a decision some time pretty soon" regarding a potential run but indicated he had "something else in mind."[156]
Speaking to an audience of more than five thousand people in Boca Raton, Florida on April 16, 2011, Trump implied that voter reaction to the 2008 financial crisis and the perception of slow progress on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan during the final months of George W. Bush's second term as President was the primary cause for the election of his successor Barack Obama and further that Obama would probably be known "as the worst president in U.S. history."[157]
Trump brought attention to conspiracy theories questioning Obama's citizenship status in media appearances and received heavy criticism from political opponents for this.[158][159] In an NBC-TV interview broadcast April 7, 2011, Trump said he was "not satisfied that Obama had proven his citizenship."[160]
In an April 2011 NBC interview, Trump disclosed that he had sent researchers to Hawaii to investigate the matter of Obama's citizenship status, commenting "they cannot believe what they're finding,"[161] though no revelation or information was ever subsequently published. On Anderson Cooper 360° on CNN, April 25, 2011, Trump said he wanted Obama to end the issue by releasing the long-form of his birth certificate.[162][163] With media coverage and Trump's repeated calls for release of the birth certificate, Obama eventually made a formal statement in efforts by the White House to put the matter to rest with the release of the long-form of Obama's birth certificate on April 27, 2011.[164] Trump expressed pride at his role in the release of the long-form certificate in a press conference follow-up, but did not, however, say whether he would be releasing his own tax returns, despite suggesting that he would make those public when Obama produced his long-form birth certificate.[165] In May 2011, Public Policy Polling described the events as "one of the quickest rises and falls in the history of presidential politics".[166]
Following President Obama's re-election, Trump sent messages on his Twitter account saying that the election was a "sham and a travesty" and that the electoral college was "a disaster" and called for "a revolution".[167] Trump deleted the last comment when it became clear that Obama had won the electoral college[168][169] and also the popular vote.[170]
Trump is popularly known as The Donald, a nickname perpetuated by the media after his first wife Ivana Trump, a native of the Czech Republic, referred to him as such in an interview.[171]
While it has been reported that he does not shake hands because of fear of germs,[172] he claims this is "a rumor that the enemies say", and shook hands repeatedly in public during a visit to New Hampshire in April 2011.[173] Trump is a golfer, with a low single-figure handicap. He is a member of the Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York, and plays regularly at the other courses he owns and operates.[174]
Trump's mother, Mary Anne, was born in 1912 at Tong, Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis, off the coast of Scotland, United Kingdom. In 1930, aged 18, on a holiday in New York, she met Fred Trump and stayed in New York. Born in Queens, New York,[175] Trump has four siblings: two brothers, Fred, Jr. (who is deceased) and Robert S. Trump; and two sisters, Maryanne and Elizabeth. His older sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, is a federal appeals court judge.
In 1977, Trump married Ivana Zelníčková and together they have three children: Donald, Jr. (born December 31, 1977), Ivanka (born October 30, 1981), and Eric (born January 6, 1984). They were divorced in 1992. In 1993, he married Marla Maples and together they had one child, Tiffany (born October 13, 1993). They divorced on June 8, 1999. In a February 2008 interview on ABC's news program Nightline, Trump commented on his ex-wives by saying, "I just know it's very hard for them (Ivana and Marla) to compete because I do love what I do. I really love it."
On April 26, 2004, he proposed to Melania Knauss (Melanija Knavs), a native of Slovenia. Trump and Knauss married on January 22, 2005, at Bethesda by the Sea Episcopal Church, on the island of Palm Beach, Florida, followed by a reception at Trump's Mar-A-Lago estate.[176] Melania gave birth to a boy named Barron William Trump, Trump's fifth child, on March 20, 2006.
Trump has six grandchildren. Four from his son Donald Jr. (Kai Madison,[177] Donald John III,[178] Tristan Milos,[179] and Spencer Frederick) and two from his daughter Ivanka (Arabella Rose and Joseph Frederick [180][181]).
Trump has stated in interviews that he is a Presbyterian. In April 2011 on Human Events, he said that he is "a Presbyterian within the Protestant group".[6] In an April 2011 interview, on the 700 Club, Trump said, "I'm a Protestant, I'm a Presbyterian. And you know I've had a good relationship with the church over the years. I think religion is a wonderful thing. I think my religion is a wonderful religion."[136][182] A 2010 article in The Daily Telegraph stated that Trump was Catholic.[183] A February 2011 Politics Daily article described Trump as "apparently a member of the Dutch Reformed Church, which is a Presbyterian denomination".[184] Andrew Cusack in 2008 stated that Donald Trump is a member of New York City's Marble Collegiate Church. Explaining that church's organizational relationships, Cusack says "the Collegiate Reformed Protestant Dutch Church is actually a denomination within a denomination" and that the Collegiate Churches are "now part of the Reformed Church of America".[185] Marble Collegiate Church also states that it is denominationally affiliated with the Reformed Church in America,[186] with the RCA website stating that the RCA has a local church "presbyterian form of government".[187] Trump does not drink alcohol.[188]
In September 2010, Trump expressed on Anderson Cooper's show on CNN, his "suspicions of ulterior motives at the imam running the project" known as Park51, claiming the imam was "using religion" (meaning Islam) to get a good price for the real estate.[189] He also appeared on Fox's Hannity, and said much the same.[190] Trump was quoted by the New York Post that, while he "is a 'big believer in freedom of religion,' ... his personal opinion was that the mosque should not be built close to Ground Zero ...". After Trump offered in a letter to buy the two-building site for more than $6 million in order to end the general controversy, the lawyers for the majority stakeholder, according to the Post, criticized "Trump's letter offering to buy the site as a publicity stunt".[191]
In 1973, the Justice Department sued Trump Management Corporation for alleged racial discrimination, at which time Trump was the company's president.[192] The federal government filed the lawsuit against his New York real estate company for discriminating against potential black renters.[193]
After the rape of a white female jogger in Central Park in 1989, Trump aroused controversy in New York's black community when he took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty for the African-American teenage suspects—who were all later exonerated. One of the defendant’s lawyers, Colin Moore, compared Trump's stance to the racist attitudes expressed in the 1930s during the infamous Scottsboro Boys case.[192]
In 1991, Trump was accused of making racial slurs against black people in a book written by John R. O'Donnell, former president of Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino, called Trumped!. O'Donnell wrote that Trump once said, in reference to a black accountant at Trump Plaza, "laziness is a trait in blacks". He also told O'Donnell: "Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day."[192][194] In response, Trump called O'Donnell a disgruntled employee but he didn't deny allegations made in the book during an interview with Playboy magazine in 1999.[192]
In April 2011, when Trump made allegations that Obama didn't get good enough grades to warrant entry to Harvard Law School, CBS News chief Washington correspondent Bob Schieffer called it absurd. "That's just code for saying he got into law school because he's black. This is an ugly strain of racism that's running through this whole thing. We can hope that kind of comes to an end too, but we'll have to see", Schieffer said.[195]
In mid-April 2011, when Trump was asked during a radio interview about whether or not he is supported by African-Americans, he replied "I have a great relationship with the blacks. I've always had a great relationship with the blacks." Walter Fields, former head of NAACP New Jersey, described Trump's comments as "highly offensive".[192]
On April 27, 2011, David Letterman, while interviewing Dr. Phil McGraw in his Late Show said "It's all fun, it's all a circus, it's all a rodeo, until it starts to smack of racism. And then it's no longer fun" about Trump questioning Obama's entry into Harvard.[196] Referring to Trump, Letterman added "if he comes back on this show, and I'm not sure we want him back under those circumstances, but he ought to be prepared to apologize just for that kind of behavior."[197] Trump's questioning regarding Obama's place of birth has provoked additional charges of racism, with a number of public figures including Bill Maher,[198][199] Jesse Jackson and Whoopi Goldberg accusing him of employing crude and unfair stereotypes.[192]
On June 5, 2013, Trump shared his thoughts on race and crime on Twitter which was considered controversial and prejudiced, by critics. Trump tweeted: "According to Bill O'Reilly, 80% of all the shootings in New York City are blacks-if you add Hispanics, that figure goes to 98%, 1% white". Trump also tweeted: "Sadly, the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics-a tough subject-must be discussed".[200][201] The statistics that Fox News pundit Bill O'Reilly cited were from the 2012 New York City Enforcement Report compiled by the police department, based on 662 shooting suspects. However, according to the figures in the report, 78.2% of shooting suspects were black, while 18.9% were Hispanic and 2.4% were white.[200] Media critic Eric Deggans dismissed Trump's views. Deggans wrote in a Tampa Bay Times column, "There is no doubt that violent crime is a serious problem in communities of color, but connecting it to race in such a blunt and unfair fashion seems more about blaming certain kinds of people than solving the problem. As always, it remains puzzling that NBC continues to offer a platform to someone so willing to pass along prejudice disguised as political speech."[200]
On April 24, 2013, Trump sent a tweet about Jon Stewart of The Daily Show, which some other Twitter users believe had anti-Semitic undertones: "I promise you that I'm much smarter than Jonathan Leibowitz – I mean Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow. Who, by the way, is totally overrated."[202] Andy Lassner, producer of the Ellen DeGeneres Show, tweeted in response: "I knew you were more than just a racist. Proud of you for showing your anti-semitic stripes too."[203]
On August 24, 2013, a lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman alleged that Trump defrauded more than 5,000 persons of $40 million, handed over for what was supposed to be the opportunity to learn Trump's real estate investment magic at his for-profit training program, Trump University.[204] Beginning in 2005, Trump University offered a program that began with a free introductory 90-minute presentation promising to teach Donald Trump's secrets that helped build his real estate empire. This was, according to the suit, no more than a lengthy promotion for a three-day, $1,500 seminar. The three-day program, in turn, was used to plug "elite" courses that cost anywhere from $10,000 to $35,000.[204] In October 2013, Trump's lawyers asked the court to extend the deadline for Trump to respond to the lawsuit until mid-December. The court rejected that request, but it gave Trump's lawyers until November 1, 2013, to file their response.[205]
Appearing on Fox & Friends on April 2, 2012 (which was World Autism Awareness Day), Trump stated that he suspects that vaccines may be linked to autism.[206] This, as well as similar remarks he made on Twitter the following August,[207] led many to criticize Trump for making dangerous and inaccurate statements regarding the causes of autism.[206][208] His remarks on Twitter led Richard Besser, ABC News's Chief Health and Medical editor, to label them "shameful":
"The autism-vaccine link has been disproven. Spreading shots out over a long period of time will not reduce the number of children who develop autism but it will leave more children vulnerable to infectious diseases for a longer period of time than necessary. That can kill children."[206]

Donald J. Trump started his business career in an office he shared with his father, Fred, in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, New York. He worked with his father for five years, where they were busy making deals together. Mr. Trump has stated, My father was my mentor and I learned a tremendous amount about every aspect of the construction industry from him. Likewise, Fred C. Trump often stated that some of my best deals were made by my son, Donald.everything he touches turns to gold. Mr. Trump then entered the very different world of Manhattan real estate.
In New York City, the Trump signature is synonymous with the most prestigious of addresses. Among them is the world-renowned Fifth Avenue skyscraper, Trump Tower. Luxury residential buildings include Trump World Tower at the United Nations Plaza, Trump Park Avenue at 59th Street and Park Avenue, Trump Place on the Hudson River, and Trump Palace. In 1997, Trump International Hotel & Tower opened its doors to the world, a 52-story super luxury hotel and residential building designed by the famed architect Philip Johnson. The property is one of only three in the country to have received a double Mobil Five-Star rating for both the hotel and its restaurant, Jean- Georges. In 2008, the 92-story Trump International Hotel & Tower Chicago opened and was touted by Condé Nast Traveler as the hottest new hotel in North America. The Trump Hotel Collection has projects going up around the world and met with tremendous success.
Mr. Trump is also known as a world-class golf course developer, with award-winning courses in New York, New Jersey, Los Angeles (Trump National Golf Clubs), Palm Beach (Trump International Golf Club), Canouan Island in the Grenadines and one in development in Aberdeen, Scotland (Trump International Golf Links) as well as Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Mr. Trump is an avid golfer and his passion is evident in the spectacular courses he has developed and continues to develop worldwide. His latest acquisitions are Trump National Golf Club, Colts Neck, N.J, and Trump National Golf Club, Washington, D.C. which fronts the Potomac River for three miles.
As an accomplished and best selling author, Mr. Trump has had numerous best sellers including: The Art of the Deal, which is considered a business classic, The Art of the Comeback, The America We Deserve, How To Get Rich, Think Like a Billionaire, Trump 101, Why We Want You To Be Rich, Think Big, Never Give Up, and Think Like a Champion.
In a departure from his real estate acquisitions, Mr. Trump and the NBC Television Network are partners in the ownership and broadcast rights for the Miss Universe, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA Pageants. In January of 2004, Mr. Trump joined forces with Mark Burnett Productions and NBC to produce and star in the television reality show, The Apprentice. The show quickly became #1 on television and is currently in its tenth season. Mr. Trumps production company, Trump Productions, is based in Los Angeles. Mr. Trump also had a successful radio program on Clear Channel for several years.
Donald J. Trump is the very definition of the American success story. He has continually set new standards of excellence while expanding his interests nationally and internationally. Mr. Trump is personally involved in everything that his name represents. This commitment has made him the pre-eminent developer of quality real estate known around the world, and in all his endeavors the Trump gold standard is apparent. He is the archetypal businessmana deal maker without peer and an ardent philanthropist.

=======================================================
                The yuppie legend with a towering ego (and hairstyle) to match his hotels and casinos. Ivana and bankruptcy slowed him down, but hit TV series 'The Apprentice' put the dealmaker back on top.A gifted self-publicist, Donald Trump is a rich property tycoon who achieved notoriety for his flamboyant style in the 1980s. Despite being declared bankrupt in 1990, Trump has rebuilt his fortune and is currently thought to be worth around $1.6 billion. The third generation of a business family, the young Trump assisted his father in ventures to build affordable housing. He had a good eye for business and after school Trump went to study finance at Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. When he left, his chief resolve was ‘to do’ real estate on a larger scale than his father. To do this Trump needed connections. Though broke, he moved to Manhattan and charmed his way past the members’ committee of an exclusive club; their only condition being that he did not steal the older members' wives. With these New York contacts came the access to power and money, and Trump made the rich and famous his niche market. He understood their psychology well and, while other developers fought to cut corners and lower prices, Trump raised his. He became one of the most powerful landlords of the 1980s, with ownership of several glass towers at exclusive addresses in New York, two casinos and the Trump Shuttle airline. With the 1990s came recession, and when Trump was unable to pay a $2 billion bank loan, most of his assets were seized by creditors and his wife divorced him. Remarkably, though, he fought his way back to riches and wrote a book about it, called 'The Art of the Comeback'. In 1999, Trump announced he was considering running for President as the Reform Party candidate in 2000. It did not work out though and in his book Trump writes that he would never have made a good head of state, because he is too honest and a germophobe, so hates to shake hands with anybody. His 2004 reality television series, 'The Apprentice', once more took him to the pinnacle of success. Trump’s first wife Ivana has since become a celebrity in her own right, as have their three children Donald Jr, Eric and Ivanka (who was a model before later choosing to join her father’s business). However, they divorced in 1992, when he married Marla Maples, who gave birth to his fourth child Tiffany in October 1993. In 2006, his third wife Melania Knauss gave birth to a son named Barron William Trump. As well as continued success with The Apprentice, which has now been syndicated around the world, including a UK version with entrepreneur Alan Sugar, it is Trump’s political aspirations that have once again found him in the media eye. In 2010, he announced a desire to run in the 2012 US presidential election, and later identified a leaning to the Republican Party. During his tentative campaign, the most notable stunt was to raise questions about the incumbent Barack Obama's citizenship status. He repeatedly called for Obama to release his birth certificate, as Trump did not believe he was truly born in the United States. This gained him support among the right-wing Republican faction, the Tea Party, but little amongst the liberal media.  He was accused of racism, on account of Obama being African-American, as well as being called out of touch and farcical for believing that the President’s background would not have been thoroughly checked.  The issue was resolved when Obama publically released his birth certificate, confirming that he was born in Hawaii. Trump later took credit for this move. Following this episode, in May 2011, Trump announced that he would not seek the Republican nomination. He claimed that “business is my greatest passion” and he was not prepared to step down from his business responsibilities. He did, however, maintain that if he were to run, he would be successful.

Driven, focused and unrelenting, he seems to surmount even the most impossible business odds. So how did the “Donald” get to where he is today?His story is more interesting than you think. The Young Trump Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946 in Queens to Frederick Trump, a builder and real estate developer and his wife Mary MacLeod Trump whom he married in 1936. As a young boy Donald Trump was an energetic and assertive child and his worried parents sent him to the New York Military Academy at 13, hoping the school would channel his energy in a more positive manner. The school’s discipline did do him good and Trump went on to earn academic honors and even played in the varsity football and baseball teams, the latter of which he captained in 1964. After graduating from NYMA he attended Fordham University but only spent two years there before transferring to the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania were he graduated in 1968 with a degree in Economics. Early business life Trump joined his father’s company, the Elizabeth Trump & Son, which built middle-class rental housing in the Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island boroughs in New York. He wanted to expand the company and was able to persuade his father to be more liberal in the loans based on the equity in the Trump apartment complexes. In 1971 he moved to Manhattan where he was able to familiarize himself with influential people. By then he had realized this was a place where he could build his dreams. After the Pennsylvania Central Railroad declared bankruptcy, Trump got a lead on a lot at the railroad yards on the west side but when it proved unfeasible for apartments he promoted the site as the location for a city convention center. He offered to forego a fee if the center would be named after his family but the city turned it down. In 1974 Trump acquired one of Pennsylvania Central’s oldest hotels, The Commodore, which was not earning money at the time but strategically located next to Grand Central Station.The following year he signed a partnership with Hyatt Hotel Corp. which did not have a presence in the area. He then completely renovated the building and it successfully opened as the Grand Hyatt in 1980. But the building that would bring him to the attention of the world had yet to rise. A year earlier in 1979 he had leased a site on Fifth Avenue, which was to be the future site of Trump Tower. The 58-story building opened in 1982 and impressed visitors with its six-story atrium lined with pink marble and an 80-foot waterfall. Empire expansion Trump wanted in on the casino scene and already got his gambling license as early as 1977. He bought property in Atlantic City and got a partnership offered by Holiday Inns Corp. which operated Harrah’s Casino.In 1982 a Harrah’s Casino opened at the Trump Plaza but Trump later brought out Holiday Inn in 1986 and renamed the it the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino.He was not idle in Atlantic City either, where he bought a Hilton casino hotel and later the Taj Mahal. He never planned to stop development in New York. In 1985 he bought a 76 acres on the west side of Manhattan to build a complex to be called Television City, upon which was to rise a mall, a riverfront park and a dozen skyscrapers. Opposition by the local community delayed the construction of the project.Always wary for any opportunity, Trump also set his eyes south and built a condominium project in West Palm Beach, Florida.  Much later in 2000, a state appeals court ruled that Trump had the right to finish an 856-foot-tall condominium after an interest group sued the city, claiming that it was violating zoning laws by allowing Trump to build over everything else in the neighborhood. New York has since revised the zoning laws to allow such projects. Trump’s near-fall But all his success might not have come to pass. In 1990 the real estate market declined and the value of income of Trump’s empire was drastically decreased. His own net worth was cut down by almost two-thirds from $1.7 billion to $500 million. Only a massive infusion of loans kept it from collapsing, and just when everybody had counted him out Trump brought his company back, coming close to worth $2 billion in 1997. Personal life of “The Donald” His personal life was almost as watched as his business life. He married thrice and divorced twice. He was first married to Ivana but then later divorced. He married again this time to actress Marla Maples who gave him a daughter before they married in 1993. In1997 he filed for divorce from her which was finalized in 1999.In January 2005 Trump married model Melania Knauss. One of Trump’s more colorful friends is World Wrestling Federation Chairman Vince McMahon. Trump often guested on wrestling specials where they would make bets.The most famous one was where they each picked a wrestler to fight for them and the winner would shave the loser’s head. Trump got to keep his hair. Another famous character he was associated with was controversial boxer “Iron” Mike Tyson. At one time Trump acted as his financial adviser and even hosted his fight against Michael Spinks in Atlantic City. In 2004 Trump also starred in the NBC reality series The Apprentice which quickly became a hit. Contestants were often dismissed from the show with his trademark line “you’re fired.” Trump is also called, though maybe never in his presence, “The Donald”, a nickname adopted by the media after his first wife Ivana called him that during an interview.After rumors spread that his fear of germs stops him from shaking other people’s hands, Trump debunked this by shaking hands repeatedly during a visit to New Hampshire in April 2011, calling it a “rumor that enemies say.” Trump for president? On October 1999, Trump said he formed a committee to look into his decision whether or not to seek the Reform Party’s nomination for the 2000 presidential elections. In 2012 he again publicly announced he was considering running for president again, but by this time his reputation has been tarnished by his association with the “Birther movement” a group that still believes President Barack Obama was not born in the US, he later backed out but is still a staunch critic of the President.

They have one child. He was previously married to Marla Maples and Ivana Trump.
      Daughter Ivanka Trump is a model and attended Georgetown University, but later transfered to the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business.
      Donald Trump's father, Fred Christ Trump (born in Woodhaven, New York, October 11, 1905), was a multi-millionaire developer son of German Parents. Fred developed apartments, homes and high rises in New York. He died June 25, 1999. Married in 1936 to Mary MacLeod (born in Stornoway, Scotland, May 10, 1912), who died August 7, 2000.

      Former owner of the New Jersey Generals football club of the United States Football League (USFL) (1984-1985).
      Was voted the class "Ladies Man" by classmates on New York Military Academy's class of 1964 at Cornwall-on-Hudson, NY.
      Unlike most business executives, he doesn't carry a briefcase and possesses a morbid fear of shaking hands.
      In his first book, "The Art Of The Deal", he wrote that he briefly thought of attending the University of Southern California (USC), with the idea of becoming a film producer or studio executive. He eventually changed his mind when he decided that the real estate business was more lucrative.
      Threw out the opening pitch to game 2 of the Red Sox/ Yankees double-header on 8/18/06. It was the Jimmy Fund fund-raiser day, where he, the Boston Red Sox, and many other donors gave in nearly three million dollars for cancer research. Sadly, the Red Sox lost that game 14-11.
      Is a longtime friend of WWF owner Vince McMahon, and a longtime fan of World Wrestling Entertainment. The Donald hosted WrestleMania IV and V at Trump Plaza, and appeared in a ringside seat at a few others. He has also appeared on WWE TV shows and participated in WWE story-lines.
      Has four grandchildren; granddaughter, Kai Trump, born on May 12, 2007, weighing 6 lb. 14 oz., grandsons, Donald Trump III, born on February 18, 2009, weighing 8 lb. 11 oz. and Tristan Milos Trump, born October 2, 2011, weighing 8 lb. 4 oz., from his son, Donald Trump Jr., and daughter-in-law, Vanessa Trump and granddaughter, Arabella Rose Kushner, born July 17, 2011, from his daughter, Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.
      Brothers: Fred Trump, Jr. and Robert Trump. Sisters: Judge Maryanne Trump Barry and Elizabeth Trump Grau.

      As a guest of FOX's Bill O'Reilly Trump confessed that, though once a pro-choice advocate, he is now pro-life, and is against gay marriage.
      Was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 6, 2013 at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Other inductees were Trish Stratus, Bruno Sammartino, Bob Backlund and Mick Foley.
      Throughout April, 2011, he alleged that Pres. Barack Obama might have been born outside the United States, which would make Obama ineligible to be president. The allegations were understood to not be serious. Showing that there were no hard feelings, Obama allowed Trump to attend the White House Press Corps Dinner.
      You know, it really doesn't matter what [the media] write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass.
      All of the women on The Apprentice (2004) flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.
      Watch somebody sell their used car and not wash it. You can spend $10 washing the car and get another $200 for the car.
      A little more moderation would be good. Of course, my life hasn't exactly been one of moderation.
      Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game.
      Well, yes, I've fired a lot of people. Generally I like other people to fire, because it's always a lousy task. But I have fired many people.
      On his catchphrase "You're fired!" from The Apprentice (2004): "I mean, there's no arguing. There is no anything. There is no beating around the bush. 'You're fired' is a very strong term."
      "I wish I'd had a great marriage. See, my father was always very proud of me, but the one thing he got right was that he had a great marriage. He was married for 64 years. One of my ex-wives once said to me, 'You have to work at a marriage'. And I said, 'That's the most ridiculous thing', because my parents, they didn't work at the marriage. If you have to work at a marriage, it's not going to work. It has to be sort of a natural thing. But my ex-wife would say, 'You have to work at this, you have to do this, you have to do that'. And I'm saying to myself, 'Man, I work all day long, well into the evening. I don't want to come home and work at a marriage. A marriage has to be very easy'. My father would come home, have dinner, and take it easy. It was the most natural marriage I've ever seen. And Melania (Melania Trump)makes my life easy; one of the things I so love about her is that she makes my life easier. I've never had anybody that made my life so easy. Now I hope that continues. Perhaps that will change. I intend to find out!" [October 2004].
      It's tangible, it's solid, it's beautiful. It's artistic, from my standpoint, and I just love real estate.
Rosie O'Donnell called me a snake oil salesman. And, you know, coming from Rosie, that's pretty low because when you look at her and when you see the mind, the mind is weak. I don't see it. I don't get it. I never understood -- how does she even get on television?
      [when asked if he would run for President of the United States] People wanted me to very strongly and I decided I didn't want to do it. I sort of enjoy what I'm doing and I continue to enjoy what I'm doing. I have never had more fun. And then to cap it off with a star on the walk of fame today was just a lot of fun. And, you know, it's just -- it's just very sad to me what's happening with this country in terms of world and in terms of world perception.
      On Alan Sugar, host of the British television Version of "The Apprentice": "I don't know what Alan Sugar looks like. You know, I own the show, but I don't even know what he looks like. I mean, I hear he's doing nicely, not like we're doing over here, but doing fine."

Donald TrumpBusiness Personality / TV PersonalityBorn: 14 June 1946Birthplace: New York, New YorkBest known as: The New York mogul who says "You're fired!" on TV's The ApprenticeDonald Trump has made his name synonymous with New York hustle, money and ego. Donald Trump started young in his father's New York real estate business, and by the 1970s had made himself a Manhattan deal-maker, somehow talking banks and city government into financing his ambitious developments. He built the grandiose Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in 1982, and soon he moved into the casino business in New Jersey. Outspoken and flamboyant, Donald Trump became a favorite of the press, and his multiple marriages and divorces were regular tabloid fodder. (Trump was married to model Ivana Zelnicek from 1977-92 and to Marla Maples from 1993-99. He married his third wife, Slovenian model Melania Knauss, on 22 January 2005.) Trump went suddenly on the skids in 1990, finding himself over $900 million in debt and facing bankruptcy. But ever the dealmaker, he rebounded; by the year 2000 he was again worth over a billion dollars. He talked publicly about running for the U.S. presidency the same year, then decided against it. In 2004 he began playing the demanding boss-man in what became a long-running NBC reality series, The Apprentice. ("You're fired," his ritualistic dismissal of the show's losers, became a popular catch-phrase.) He also made noises about running for president in the elections of 2008 and 2012, but has never formally tossed his hat in the ring. His books include Trump: The Art of the Deal (1988), Trump: Surviving at the Top (1990), Trump: The Art of the Comeback (1997) and Trump: How to Get Rich (2004).Extra credit: Donald Trump's nickname is "The Donald"... Donald Trump has three children with his wife Ivana: Donald Jr. (b. 1977), Ivanka (b. 1981) and Eric (b. 1984); he has one daughter with Maples, Tiffany (b. 1993); and he has a son with Knauss, Barron, born in March of 2006... Trump is famous for his objection to handshakes; a 1999 Time magazine article quoted him as saying "I think the handshake is barbaric... Shaking hands, you catch the flu, you catch this, you catch all sorts of things"... Another germophobic casino-owning billionaire was Howard Hughes.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC.
