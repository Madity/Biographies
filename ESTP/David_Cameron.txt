This article is about the British Prime Minister.  For other uses, see David Cameron (disambiguation).
David William Donald Cameron (/ˈkæm(ə)rən/; born 9 October 1966) is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, First Lord of the Treasury, Minister for the Civil Service and Leader of the Conservative Party. He represents Witney as its Member of Parliament (MP).[1]
Cameron studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Brasenose College, Oxford, gaining a first-class honours degree in 1988. He was described by his tutor, Professor Vernon Bogdanor, as "one of the ablest"[2] students he has taught, with "moderate and sensible Conservative" political views.[3] While at Oxford he was a member of the Bullingdon Club. He then joined the Conservative Research Department and became Special Adviser to Norman Lamont, and then to Michael Howard. He was Director of Corporate Affairs at Carlton Communications for seven years.
Cameron was defeated in his first candidacy for Parliament at Stafford in 1997, but was elected in 2001 as the Member of Parliament for the Oxfordshire constituency of Witney. He was promoted to the Opposition front bench two years later, and rose rapidly to become head of policy co-ordination during the 2005 general election campaign. With a public image of a youthful, moderate candidate who would appeal to young voters, he won the Conservative leadership election in 2005.[4]
In the 2010 United Kingdom general election held on 6 May, the Conservatives won 306 seats in a hung parliament. After five days of negotiation, Cameron formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats (Lib Dems). Cameron leads the first coalition government of the United Kingdom since the Second World War. The 43-year-old Cameron became the youngest British Prime Minister since the Earl of Liverpool 198 years earlier.[5]
David Cameron is the younger son of stockbroker Ian Donald Cameron (12 October 1932 – 8 September 2010) and his wife Mary Fleur (née Mount, born 1934,[6] a retired Justice of the Peace, daughter of Sir William Mount, 2nd Baronet).[7] Cameron's parents were married on 20 October 1962.[6]
Cameron was born in London and brought up in Peasemore, Berkshire.[8] Cameron has a brother, Alexander Allan (born 1963, a barrister and QC)[9] and two sisters, Tania Rachel (born 1965) and Clare Louise (born 1971).[6][3] His father, Ian, was born at Blairmore House, a country house near Huntly, Aberdeenshire, and died near Toulon, in France, on 8 September 2010;[10] Ian was born with both legs deformed and underwent repeated operations to correct them. Blairmore was built by Cameron's great-great-grandfather, Alexander Geddes,[11] who had made a fortune in the grain trade in Chicago and returned to Scotland in the 1880s.[12]
Through his paternal grandmother, Enid Agnes Maud Levita, Cameron is a lineal descendant of King William IV by his mistress Dorothea Jordan. This illegitimate line consists of five generations of women starting with Elizabeth Hay, Countess of Erroll, née FitzClarence, William and Jordan's sixth child,[13] through to Cameron's grandmother (thereby making Cameron a 5th cousin of Queen Elizabeth II).[14]
Cameron's paternal forebears also have a long history in finance. His father Ian was senior partner of the stockbrokers Panmure Gordon, in which firm partnerships had long been held by Cameron's ancestors, including David's grandfather and great-grandfather,[3] and was a Director of estate agent John D. Wood. David Cameron's great-great-grandfather Emile Levita, a German Jewish financier (and descendant of Renaissance scholar Elia Levita), who obtained British citizenship in 1871, was the director of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China which became Standard Chartered Bank in 1969.[14] His wife, Cameron's great-great-grandmother, was a descendant of the wealthy Danish Jewish Rée family on her father's side.[15][16]
One of Emile's sons, Arthur Francis Levita (died 1910, brother of Sir Cecil Levita),[17] of Panmure Gordon stockbrokers, together with great-great-grandfather Sir Ewen Cameron,[18] London head of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, played key roles in arranging loans supplied by the Rothschilds to the Japanese Central Banker (later Prime Minister) Takahashi Korekiyo for the financing of the Japanese Government in the Russo-Japanese war.[19]
Cameron's maternal grandfather was Sir William Mount, 2nd Baronet, an Army officer who served as High Sheriff of Berkshire, and Cameron's maternal great-grandfather was Sir William Mount, 1st Baronet, CBE, Conservative MP for Newbury 1918–1922. Cameron's great-great-grandmother was Lady Ida Matilda Alice Feilding. His great-great-great-grandfather was William Feilding, 7th Earl of Denbigh, GCH, PC, a courtier and Gentleman of the Bedchamber.[20] His mother's cousin, Sir Ferdinand Mount, was head of 10 Downing Street's Policy Unit in the early 1980s. Cameron is the nephew of Sir William Dugdale, brother-in-law of Katherine, Lady Dugdale (died 2004) Lady-in-Waiting to HM The Queen since 1955,[21][22] and former Chairman of Aston Villa Football Club. Birmingham-born documentary filmmaker Joshua Dugdale is his cousin.[23]
Cameron has said: "On my mother's side of the family, her mother was a Llewellyn, so Welsh. I'm a real mixture of Scottish, Welsh and English".[24]
From the age of seven, Cameron was educated at two independent schools: at Heatherdown School in Winkfield (near Ascot) in Berkshire, which counts Prince Andrew and Prince Edward among its alumni. Due to good academic grades, Cameron entered its top academic class almost two years early.[25] At the age of thirteen, he went to Eton College in Berkshire, following his father and elder brother.[26] His early interest was in art. Six weeks before taking his O-Levels he was caught smoking cannabis.[4] He admitted the offence and had not been involved in selling drugs, so he was not expelled, but was fined, prevented from leaving school grounds, and given a "Georgic" (a punishment which involved copying 500 lines of Latin text).[27]
Cameron passed 12 O-Levels and then studied three A-Levels in History of Art, History and Economics with Politics. He obtained three 'A' grades and a '1' grade in the Scholarship Level exam in Economics and Politics.[28] The following autumn he passed the entrance exam for the University of Oxford, where he was offered an exhibition.[29]
After leaving Eton in 1984,[30] Cameron started a nine-month gap year. He worked as a researcher for Tim Rathbone, Conservative MP for Lewes, his godfather. In his three months, he attended debates in the House of Commons.[31] Through his father, he was then employed for a further three months in Hong Kong by Jardine Matheson as a 'ship jumper', an administrative post.[32]
Returning from Hong Kong, Cameron visited the then Soviet Union, where he was approached by two Russian men speaking fluent English. Cameron was later told by one of his professors that it was 'definitely an attempt' by the KGB to recruit him.[33]
Cameron then began his Bachelor of Arts studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) at Brasenose College, Oxford.[34] His tutor, Professor Vernon Bogdanor, described him as "one of the ablest"[2] students he has taught, with "moderate and sensible Conservative" political views.[3]
Guy Spier, who shared tutorials with him, remembers him as an outstanding student: "We were doing our best to grasp basic economic concepts. David - there was nobody else who came even close. He would be integrating them with the way the British political system is put together. He could have lectured me on it, and I would have sat there and taken notes.."[35] When commenting in 2006 on his former pupil's ideas about a "Bill of Rights" to replace the Human Rights Act, however, Professor Bogdanor, himself a Liberal Democrat, said, "I think he is very confused. I've read his speech and it's filled with contradictions. There are one or two good things in it but one glimpses them, as it were, through a mist of misunderstanding".[36]
While at Oxford, Cameron was a member of the élite student dining society, the Bullingdon Club, which has a reputation for an outlandish drinking culture associated with boisterous behaviour and damaging property.[37] A photograph showing Cameron in a tailcoat with other members of this exclusive club, including Boris Johnson, surfaced in 2007, but was later withdrawn by the copyright holder.[38] Cameron's period in the Bullingdon Club was examined in a Channel 4 docu-drama, When Boris Met Dave, broadcast on 7 October 2009. His friends outside the Bullingdon Club included fellow PPE student Catherine Fall. Cameron graduated in 1988 with a first-class honours degree (MA).[39]
Cameron was a member of White's gentleman's club in St James's Street, London, until he resigned his membership in 2008.[40]
After graduation, Cameron worked for the Conservative Research Department between September 1988 and 1993. In 1991, Cameron was seconded to Downing Street to work on briefing John Major for his then bi-weekly session of Prime Minister's Questions. One newspaper gave Cameron the credit for "sharper ... Despatch box performances" by Major,[41] which included highlighting for Major "a dreadful piece of doublespeak" by Tony Blair (then the Labour Employment spokesman) over the effect of a national minimum wage.[42] He became head of the political section of the Conservative Research Department, and in August 1991 was tipped to follow Judith Chaplin as Political Secretary to the Prime Minister.[43]
However, Cameron lost to Jonathan Hill, who was appointed in March 1992. He was given the responsibility for briefing Major for his press conferences during the 1992 general election.[44] During the campaign, Cameron was one of the young "brat pack" of party strategists who worked between 12 and 20 hours a day, sleeping in the house of Alan Duncan in Gayfere Street, Westminster, which had been Major's campaign headquarters during his bid for the Conservative leadership.[45] Cameron headed the economic section; it was while working on this campaign that Cameron first worked closely with Steve Hilton, who was later to become Director of Strategy during his party leadership.[46] The strain of getting up at 4:45 am every day was reported to have led Cameron to decide to leave politics in favour of journalism.[47]
The Conservatives' unexpected success in the 1992 election led Cameron to hit back at older party members who had criticised him and his colleagues, saying "whatever people say about us, we got the campaign right," and that they had listened to their campaign workers on the ground rather than the newspapers. He revealed he had led other members of the team across Smith Square to jeer at Transport House, the former Labour headquarters.[48] Cameron was rewarded with a promotion to Special Adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont.[49]
Cameron was working for Lamont at the time of Black Wednesday, when pressure from currency speculators forced the Pound sterling out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. At the 1992 Conservative Party conference,Cameron had difficulty trying to arrange to brief the speakers in the economic debate, having to resort to putting messages on the internal television system imploring the mover of the motion, Patricia Morris, to contact him.[50] Later that month Cameron joined a delegation of Special Advisers who visited Germany to build better relations with the Christian Democratic Union; he was reported to be "still smarting" over the Bundesbank's contribution to the economic crisis.[51]
Lamont fell out with John Major after Black Wednesday and became highly unpopular with the public. Taxes needed to be raised in the 1993 Budget, and Cameron fed the options Lamont was considering through to Conservative Central Office for their political acceptability to be assessed.[52] However, Lamont's unpopularity did not necessarily affect Cameron: he was considered as a potential "kamikaze" candidate for the Newbury by-election, which includes the area where he grew up.[53] However, Cameron decided not to stand.
During the by-election, Lamont gave the response "Je ne regrette rien" to a question about whether he most regretted claiming to see "the green shoots of recovery" or admitted "singing in his bath" with happiness at leaving the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Cameron was identified by one journalist as having inspired this gaffe; it was speculated that the heavy Conservative defeat in Newbury may have cost Cameron his chance of becoming Chancellor himself, even though as he was not a Member of Parliament he could not have been.[54] Lamont was sacked at the end of May 1993, and decided not to write the usual letter of resignation; Cameron was given the responsibility to issue to the press a statement of self-justification.[55]
After Lamont was sacked, Cameron remained at the Treasury for less than a month before being specifically recruited by Home Secretary Michael Howard; it was commented that he was still "very much in favour".[56] It was later reported that many at the Treasury would have preferred Cameron to carry on.[57] At the beginning of September 1993, Cameron applied to go on Conservative Central Office's list of Prospective Parliamentary Candidates.[58]
According to Derek Lewis, then Director-General of Her Majesty's Prison Service, Cameron showed him a "his and hers list" of proposals made by Howard and his wife, Sandra. Lewis said that Sandra Howard's list included reducing the quality of prison food, although Sandra Howard denied this claim. Lewis reported that Cameron was "uncomfortable" about the list.[59] In defending Sandra Howard and insisting that she made no such proposal, the journalist Bruce Anderson wrote that Cameron had proposed a much shorter definition on prison catering which revolved around the phrase "balanced diet", and that Lewis had written thanking Cameron for a valuable contribution.[60]
During his work for Howard, Cameron often briefed the media. In March 1994, someone leaked to the Press that the Labour Party had called for a meeting with John Major to discuss a consensus on the Prevention of Terrorism Act. After an inquiry failed to find the source of the leak, Labour MP Peter Mandelson demanded assurance from Howard that Cameron had not been responsible, which Howard gave.[61][62] A senior Home Office civil servant noted the influence of Howard's Special Advisers, saying previous incumbents "would listen to the evidence before making a decision. Howard just talks to young public school gentlemen from the party headquarters."[63]
In July 1994, Cameron left his role as Special Adviser to work as the Director of Corporate Affairs at Carlton Communications.[64] Carlton, which had won the ITV franchise for London weekdays in 1991, was a growing media company which also had film distribution and video producing arms. Cameron was suggested for the role to Carlton executive chairman Michael Green by his later mother-in-law Lady Astor.[65] In 1997, Cameron played up the Company's prospects for digital terrestrial television, for which it joined with Granada television and BSkyB to form British Digital Broadcasting. In a roundtable discussion on the future of broadcasting in 1998 he criticised the effect of overlapping different regulators on the industry.[66]
Carlton's consortium did win the digital terrestrial franchise but the resulting company suffered difficulties in attracting subscribers. Cameron resigned as Director of Corporate Affairs in February 2001 in order to fight for election to Parliament, although he remained on the payroll as a consultant.
Having been approved for the Candidates' list, Cameron began looking for a seat. He was reported to have missed out on selection for Ashford in December 1994 after failing to get to the selection meeting as a result of train delays.[67] In early 1996, he was selected for Stafford, a new constituency created by boundary changes, which was projected to have a Conservative majority.[68] At the 1996 Conservative Party Conference he called for tax cuts in the forthcoming Budget to be targeted at the low-paid and to "small businesses where people took money out of their own pockets to put into companies to keep them going".[69] He also said the Party "should be proud of the Tory tax record but that people needed reminding of its achievements ... It's time to return to our tax-cutting agenda. The socialist Prime Ministers of Europe have endorsed Tony Blair because they want a federal pussy cat and not a British lion."[70]
When writing his election address, Cameron made his own opposition to British membership of the single European currency clear, pledging not to support it. This was a break with official Conservative policy but about 200 other candidates were making similar declarations.[71] Otherwise, Cameron kept closely to the national party line. He also campaigned using the claim that a Labour Government would increase the cost of a pint of beer by 24p; however, the Labour candidate, David Kidney, portrayed Cameron as "a right-wing Tory". Stafford had a swing almost the same as the national swing, which made it one of the many seats to fall to Labour: David Kidney had a majority of 4,314.[72][73] In the round of selection contests taking place in the run-up to the 2001 general election, Cameron again attempted to be selected for a winnable seat. He tried for the Kensington and Chelsea seat after the death of Alan Clark, but did not make the shortlist.
He was in the final two but narrowly lost at Wealden in March 2000,[74] a loss ascribed by Samantha Cameron to his lack of spontaneity when speaking.[75]
On 4 April 2000 Cameron was selected as prospective candidate (PPC) for Witney in Oxfordshire. This had been a safe Conservative seat but its sitting MP Shaun Woodward (who had worked with Cameron on the 1992 election campaign) had "crossed the floor" to join the Labour Party. Cameron's biographers Francis Elliott and James Hanning describe them as being "on fairly friendly terms".[76] Cameron, advised in his strategy by friend Catherine Fall, put a great deal of effort into "nursing" his potential constituency, turning up at social functions, and attacking Woodward for changing his mind on fox hunting to support a ban.[77]
During the election campaign, Cameron accepted the offer of writing a regular column for The Guardian's online section.[78] He won the seat with a 1.9% swing to the Conservatives and a majority of 7,973.[79][80]
Upon his election to Parliament, he served as a member of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, a prominent appointment for a newly elected MP. Cameron proposed that the Committee launch an inquiry into the law on drugs,[81] and urged the consideration of "radical options".[82] The report recommended a downgrading of Ecstasy from Class A to Class B, as well as moves towards a policy of 'harm reduction', which Cameron defended.[83]
Cameron determinedly attempted to increase his public visibility, offering quotations on matters of public controversy. He opposed the payment of compensation to Gurbux Singh, who had resigned as head of the Commission for Racial Equality after a confrontation with the police;[84] and commented that the Home Affairs Select Committee had taken a long time to discuss whether the phrase "black market" should be used.[85] However, he was passed over for a front-bench promotion in July 2002; Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith did invite Cameron and his ally George Osborne to coach him on Prime Minister's Questions in November 2002. The next week, Cameron deliberately abstained in a vote on allowing same-sex and unmarried couples to adopt children jointly, against a whip to oppose; his abstention was noted.[86] The wide scale of abstentions and rebellious votes destabilised the Duncan Smith leadership.
In June 2003, Cameron was appointed a shadow minister in the Privy Council Office as a deputy to Eric Forth, then Shadow Leader of the House. He also became a vice- chairman of the Conservative Party when Michael Howard took over the leadership in November of that year. He was appointed Opposition frontbench local government spokesman in 2004, before being promoted to the shadow cabinet that June as head of policy co-ordination. Later, he became Shadow Education Secretary in the post-election reshuffle.[87]
From February 2002 to August 2005 he was a non-executive director of Urbium PLC, operator of the Tiger Tiger bar chain.[88]
Following the Labour victory in the May 2005 general election, Michael Howard announced his resignation as leader of the Conservative Party and set a lengthy timetable for the leadership election. Cameron announced on 29 September 2005 that he would be a candidate. Parliamentary colleagues supporting him included Boris Johnson, Shadow Chancellor George Osborne, Shadow Defence Secretary and deputy leader of the party Michael Ancram, Oliver Letwin[89] and former party leader William Hague.[90] His campaign did not gain wide support until his speech, delivered without notes, at the 2005 Conservative Party Conference. In the speech he vowed to make people "feel good about being Conservatives again" and said he wanted "to switch on a whole new generation."[91]
In the first ballot of Conservative MPs on 18 October 2005, Cameron came second, with 56 votes, slightly more than expected; David Davis had fewer than predicted at 62 votes; Liam Fox came third with 42 votes; and Kenneth Clarke was eliminated with 38 votes. In the second ballot on 20 October 2005, Cameron came first with 90 votes; David Davis was second, with 57; and Liam Fox was eliminated with 51 votes.[92] All 198 Conservative MPs voted in both ballots.
The next stage of the election process, between Davis and Cameron, was a vote open to the entire party membership. Cameron was elected with more than twice as many votes as Davis and more than half of all ballots issued; Cameron won 134,446 votes on a 78% turnout, to Davis's 64,398.[93] Although Davis had initially been the favourite, it was widely acknowledged that his candidacy was marred by a disappointing conference speech.[94] Cameron had made a well-received speech without notes (which The Daily Telegraph said "showed a sureness and a confidence that is greatly to his credit").[95] Cameron's election as the Leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition was announced on 6 December 2005. As is customary for an Opposition leader not already a member, upon election Cameron became a member of the Privy Council, being formally approved to join on 14 December 2005, and sworn of the Council on 8 March 2006.[96]
Cameron's relative youth and inexperience before becoming leader have invited satirical comparison with Tony Blair. Private Eye soon published a picture of both leaders on its front cover, with the caption "World's first face transplant a success".[97] On the left, the New Statesman unfavourably likened his "new style of politics" to Tony Blair's early leadership years.[98] Cameron was accused of paying excessive attention to image: ITV News broadcast footage from the 2006 Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth showing him wearing four different sets of clothes within a few hours.[99] Cameron was characterised in a Labour Party political broadcast as "Dave the Chameleon", who would change what he said to match the expectations of his audience. Cameron later claimed that the broadcast had become his daughter's "favourite video".[100] He has also been described by comedy writer and broadcaster Charlie Brooker as being "like a hollow Easter egg with no bag of sweets inside" in his Guardian column.[101]
On the right, Norman Tebbit, former Chairman of the Conservative Party, likened Cameron to Pol Pot, "intent on purging even the memory of Thatcherism before building a New Modern Compassionate Green Globally Aware Party".[102] Quentin Davies MP, who defected from the Conservatives to Labour on 26 June 2007, branded him "superficial, unreliable and [with] an apparent lack of any clear convictions" and stated that David Cameron had turned the Conservative Party's mission into a "PR agenda".[103] Traditionalist conservative columnist and author Peter Hitchens has written, "Mr Cameron has abandoned the last significant difference between his party and the established left", by embracing social liberalism.[104] Daily Telegraph correspondent and blogger Gerald Warner has been particularly scathing about Cameron's leadership, arguing that it is alienating traditionalist conservative elements from the Conservative Party.[105]
Cameron is reported to be known to friends and family as "Dave", though he prefers to use "David'" in public.[106] The Times columnist Daniel Finkelstein has condemned those who attempt to belittle Cameron by calling him 'Dave'.[107]
His Shadow Cabinet appointments included MPs associated with the various wings of the party. Former leader William Hague was appointed to the Foreign Affairs brief, while both George Osborne and David Davis were retained, as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer and Shadow Home Secretary respectively. Hague, assisted by Davis, stood in for Cameron during his paternity leave in February 2006.[108] In June 2008 Davis announced his intention to resign as an MP, and was immediately replaced as Shadow Home Secretary by Dominic Grieve, the surprise move was seen as a challenge to the changes introduced under Cameron's leadership.[109]
In January 2009 a reshuffle of the Shadow Cabinet was undertaken. The chief change was the appointment of former Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke as Shadow Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Secretary, David Cameron stating that "With Ken Clarke's arrival, we now have the best economic team." The reshuffle saw eight other changes made.[110]
During his successful 2005 campaign to be elected Leader of the Conservative Party, Cameron pledged that the Conservative Party's Members of the European Parliament would leave the European People's Party group, which had a "federalist" approach to the European Union.[111] Once elected Cameron began discussions with right-wing and eurosceptic parties in other European countries, mainly in eastern Europe, and in July 2006 he concluded an agreement to form the Movement for European Reform with the Czech Civic Democratic Party, leading to the formation of a new European Parliament group, the European Conservatives and Reformists, in 2009 after the European Parliament elections.[112] Cameron attended a gathering at Warsaw's Palladium cinema celebrating the foundation of the alliance.[113]
In forming the caucus, which had 54 MEPs drawn from eight of the 27 EU member states, Cameron reportedly broke with two decades of Conservative cooperation with the centre-right Christian Democrats, the European People's Party (EPP),[114] on the grounds that they are dominated by European federalists and supporters of the Lisbon treaty.[114] EPP leader Wilfried Martens, former prime minister of Belgium, has stated "Cameron's campaign has been to take his party back to the centre in every policy area with one major exception: Europe. ... I can't understand his tactics. Merkel and Sarkozy will never accept his Euroscepticism."[114] The left-wing New Statesman magazine reported that the US administration had "concerns about Cameron among top members of the team" and quoted David Rothkopf in saying that the issue "makes Cameron an even more dubious choice to be Britain's next prime minister than he was before and, should he attain that post, someone about whom the Obama administration ought to be very cautious."[115]
Similarly, Cameron's initial "A-List" of prospective parliamentary candidates was attacked by members of his party,[116] and the policy was discontinued in favour of sex-balanced final shortlists. Before being discontinued, the policy had been criticised by senior Conservative MP and former Prisons Spokeswoman Ann Widdecombe as an "insult to women", and she had accused Cameron of "storing up huge problems for the future."[117] The plans led to conflict in some constituencies, including the widely reported resignation of Joanne Cash, a close friend of Cameron, as candidate in the constituency of Westminster North following a dispute described as "a battle for the soul of the Tory Party".
The Conservatives had last won a general election in 1992. The general election of 2010 resulted in the Conservatives, led by Cameron, winning the largest number of seats (306). This was, however, 20 seats short of an overall majority and resulted in the nation's first hung parliament since February 1974.[118] Talks between Cameron and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg led to an agreed Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition.

On 11 May 2010, following the resignation of Gordon Brown as Prime Minister and on his recommendation, Elizabeth II invited Cameron to form a government.[119] At age 43, Cameron became the youngest British Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool, who was appointed in 1812.[5] In his first address outside 10 Downing Street, he announced his intention to form a coalition government, the first since the Second World War, with the Liberal Democrats.

Cameron outlined how he intended to "put aside party differences and work hard for the common good and for the national interest."[5] As one of his first moves Cameron appointed Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, as Deputy Prime Minister on 11 May 2010.[119] Between them, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats control 363 seats in the House of Commons, with a majority of 76 seats.[120] On 2 June 2010, when Cameron took his first session of Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) as Prime Minister, he began by offering his support and condolences to those affected by the shootings in Cumbria.[121]
On 5 February 2011, Cameron criticised the failure of 'state multiculturalism', in his first speech as PM on radicalisation and the causes of terrorism.[122]
He was also the first prime minister in over a 100 years to lose a foreign policy vote in the House of Commons in regards to the Syrian civil war's Ghouta chemical attack. Amongst other notables, he agreed to holding the Scottish independence referendum, 2014 and eliminated the "devomax" option from the ballot for a straight out yes or no vote. Furthermore, Cameron was the first foreign leader to visit Jaffna since the end of the Sri Lankan civil war.[123][124][125]
Cameron describes himself as a "modern compassionate conservative" and has spoken of a need for a new style of politics, saying that he was "fed up with the Punch and Judy politics of Westminster".[126] He has stated that he is "certainly a big Thatcher fan, but I don't know whether that makes me a Thatcherite."[127] He has also claimed to be a "liberal Conservative", and "not a deeply ideological person."[128] As Leader of the Opposition, Cameron stated that he did not intend to oppose the government as a matter of course, and would offer his support in areas of agreement. He has urged politicians to concentrate more on improving people's happiness and "general well-being", instead of focusing solely on "financial wealth".[129] There have been claims that he described himself to journalists at a dinner during the leadership contest as the "heir to Blair".[130]
He believes that British Muslims have a duty to integrate into British culture, but notes that they find aspects such as high divorce rates and drug use uninspiring, and that "Not for the first time, I found myself thinking that it is mainstream Britain which needs to integrate more with the British Asian way of life, not the other way around."[131]
Daniel Finkelstein has said of the period leading up to Cameron's election as leader of the Conservative party that "a small group of us (myself, David Cameron, George Osborne, Michael Gove, Nick Boles, Nick Herbert I think, once or twice) used to meet up in the offices of Policy Exchange, eat pizza, and consider the future of the Conservative Party".[132]
Cameron co-operated with Dylan Jones, giving him interviews and access, to enable him to produce the book Cameron on Cameron.[133]
Prior to its legalisation, Cameron advocated for legalising same-sex marriage. The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 was later successfully introduced by one of his ministers.[134]
During November 2001, Cameron voted to modify legislation allowing people detained at a police station to be fingerprinted and searched for an identifying birthmark to be applicable only in connection with a terrorism investigation.[135] In March 2002, he voted against banning the hunting of wild mammals with dogs,[136] being an occasional hunter himself.[137] In April 2003, he voted against the introduction of a bill to ban smoking in restaurants.[138] In June 2003, he voted against NHS Foundation Trusts.[139] Also in 2003, he voted to keep the controversial Section 28 clause.[140]
In March 2003, he voted against a motion that the case had not yet been made for the Iraq War,[141] and then supported using "all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction".[142] In October 2003, however, he voted in favour of setting up a judicial inquiry into the Iraq War.[143] In October 2004 he voted in favour of the Civil Partnership Bill.[144] In February 2005, he voted in favour of changing the text in the Prevention of Terrorism Bill from "The Secretary of State may make a control order against an individual" to "The Secretary of State may apply to the court for a control order ..."[145] In October 2005, he voted against the Identity Cards Bill.[146]
Cameron criticised Gordon Brown (when Brown was Chancellor of the Exchequer) for being "an analogue politician in a digital age" and referred to him as "the roadblock to reform".[147] He has also said that John Prescott "clearly looks a fool" in light of allegations of ministerial misconduct.[148] During a speech to the Ethnic Media Conference on 29 November 2006, Cameron also described Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London, as an "ageing far left politician" in reference to Livingstone's views on multiculturalism.[149]
Since becoming prime minister, he has reacted to press reports that Brown could be the next head of the International Monetary Fund by hinting that he may block Brown from being appointed to the role, citing the huge national debt that Brown left the country with as a reason for Brown not being suitable for the role.[150]
Cameron has accused the UK Independence Party of being "fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists, mostly,"[151] leading UKIP leader Nigel Farage to demand an apology for the remarks. Right-wing Conservative MP Bob Spink, who later defected to UKIP, also criticised the remarks,[152] as did The Daily Telegraph.[153]
Cameron was seen encouraging Conservative MPs to join the standing ovation given to Tony Blair at the end of his last Prime Minister's Question Time; he had paid tribute to the "huge efforts" Blair had made and said Blair had "considerable achievements to his credit, whether it is peace in Northern Ireland or his work in the developing world, which will endure".[154]
In 2006, Cameron made a speech in which he described extremist Islamic organisations and the British National Party as "mirror images" to each other, both preaching "creeds of pure hatred".[155] Cameron is listed as being a supporter of Unite Against Fascism.[156]
Cameron in late 2009 urged the Lib Dems to join the Conservatives in a new "national movement" arguing there was "barely a cigarette paper" between them on a large number of issues. The invitation was rejected by the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, who attacked Cameron at the start of his party's annual conference in Bournemouth, saying that the Conservatives were totally different from his party and that the Lib Dems were the true "progressives" in UK politics.[157]
While Leader of the Conservative Party, Cameron has been accused of reliance on "old-boy networks"[158] and attacked by his party for the imposition of selective shortlists of prospective parliamentary candidates.[116]
Cameron's two most senior appointments to date, that of George Osborne as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Boris Johnson as Conservative Party candidate for Mayor of London have been former members of the Bullingdon Club. The Guardian has accused Cameron of relying on "the most prestigious of old-boy networks in his attempt to return the Tories to power", pointing out that three members of his shadow cabinet and 15 members of his front bench team were "Old Etonians".[158] Similarly, The Sunday Times has commented that "David Cameron has more Etonians around him than any leader since Macmillan" and asked whether he can "represent Britain from such a narrow base."[159] Former Labour cabinet minister Hazel Blears has said of Cameron, "You have to wonder about a man who surrounds himself with so many people who went to the same school. I'm pretty sure I don't want 21st-century Britain run by people who went to just one school."[160] However, some of the claims of an over-reliance on one school have been disputed. The writer Michael Mosbacher says that Cameron's Cabinet has the lowest number of Etonians of any past Conservative government: "David Cameron's government is the least patrician, least wealthy and least public-school-educated — indeed the least Etonian — Conservative-led government this country has ever seen".[161]
Some supporters of the party have accused Cameron's government of cronyism on the front benches. Sir Tom Cowie, working-class founder of Arriva and former Conservative donor, ceased his donations in August 2007 due to disillusionment with Cameron's leadership, saying, "the Tory party seems to be run now by Old Etonians and they don't seem to understand how other people live." In reply, Shadow Foreign Secretary William Hague, himself educated at Yorkshire state schools, said that when a party was changing, "there will always be people who are uncomfortable with that process".[162]
In a response to Cameron at Prime Minister's Questions in December 2009, Gordon Brown addressed the Conservative Party's inheritance tax policy, saying it "seems to have been dreamed up on the playing fields of Eton". This led to open discussion of "class war" by the mainstream media and leading politicians of both major parties, with speculation that the 2010 general election campaign would see the Labour Party highlight the backgrounds of senior Conservative politicians.[163]
At the launch of the Conservative Party's education manifesto in January 2010, Cameron declared an admiration for the "brazenly elitist" approach to education of countries such as Singapore and South Korea and expressed a desire to "elevate the status of teaching in our country". He suggested the adoption of more stringent criteria for entry to teaching and offered repayment of the loans of maths and science graduates obtaining first or 2.1 degrees from "good" universities.
Wes Streeting, president of the National Union of Students, said "The message that the Conservatives are sending to the majority of students is that if you didn't go to a university attended by members of the Shadow Cabinet, they don't believe you're worth as much." In response to the manifesto as a whole, Chris Keates, head of teaching union NASUWT, said teachers would be left "shocked, dismayed and demoralised" and warned of the potential for strikes as a result.[164][165]
In April 2009, The Independent reported that in 1989, while Nelson Mandela remained imprisoned under the apartheid régime, David Cameron had accepted a trip to South Africa paid for by an anti-sanctions lobby firm. A spokesperson for Cameron responded by saying that the Conservative Party was at that time opposed to sanctions against South Africa and that his trip was a fact-finding mission. However, the newspaper reported that Cameron's then superior at Conservative Research Department called the trip "jolly", saying that "it was all terribly relaxed, just a little treat, a perk of the job. The Botha regime was attempting to make itself look less horrible, but I don't regard it as having been of the faintest political consequence." Cameron distanced himself from his party's history of opposing sanctions against the regime. He was criticised by Labour MP Peter Hain, himself an anti-apartheid campaigner.[166]
In an interview on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross on 23 June 2006, Cameron said that he supported the decision of the-then Labour Government to go to war in Iraq, and said that he thought supporters should "see it through".[167] He also supported a motion brought by the SNP and Plaid Cymru on 31 October 2006 calling for an inquiry into the government's conduct of the Iraq war. In 2011, he oversaw the withdrawal of British soldiers from Iraq. In 2013, it was reported that he had blocked the publication of an Iraq inquiry report, known as the Chilcot Inquiry Report,[168] but in early May 2014, it was reported that he has demanded that the Chilcot Inquiry Report be published before the end of the year, and that he had told the cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood (a non-politically appointed senior member of the Civil Service), that "his patience is wearing thin", and it was claimed that former Prime Minister Tony Blair and Labour "want to delay the report until after the election next year to avoid any criticisms affecting their campaign". [169]
Later in the same month, it was reported that the delays to publishing the Chilcot Inquiry Report were due to negotiations over the publication of private communications between Tony Blair and then-US president George W. Bush.[170] David Cameron was reported to have told Sky News: "My understanding is that they will be able to publish before the end of the year and I very much hope they can deliver on that timetable. The public wants to see the answers of the inquiry and I think we shouldn't have to wait too much longer".[170]
Cameron coming out of a shanty home outside Jaffna town on 15 November 2013 after he spoke with elderly women
Cameron reiterated calls for an independent investigation into the alleged war crimes.[171][172] "There needs to be proper inquiries into what happened at the end of the war, there needs to be proper human rights, democracy for the Tamil minority in that country" Cameron stated.[173][174] He stated that if this investigation wasn't completed by March 2014 he would press for an independent international inquiry.[175][176][177] This followed a visit to Jaffna Peninsula, the first foreign leader to visit Jaffna, a war-ravaged town in the northern part of Sri Lanka, since the island once colonised by Britain became independent in 1948.[123][124][125][178][179] Cameron was mobbed by demonstrators, mostly women, seeking his assistance in tracing missing relatives.[180][181]"The stories I am hearing from the people here are often harrowing," Cameron wrote via Twitter from Jaffna.[123][124][125]"This is going to make a very lasting impression on me. That is something you don't forget," Cameron said at the Uthayan newspaper premises, where the portraits of slain staff line the walls.[123][124][125]
In a speech in Ankara in July 2010, Cameron stated unequivocally his support for Turkey's accession to the EU, citing economic, security and political considerations, and claimed that those who opposed Turkish membership were driven by "protectionism, narrow nationalism or prejudice".[182][183] In that speech, he was also critical of Israeli action during the Gaza flotilla raid and its Gaza policy, and repeated his opinion that Israel had turned Gaza into a "prison camp",[182] having previously referred to Gaza as "a giant open prison".[184] These views were met with mixed reactions.[185][186][187]
At the end of May 2011, Cameron stepped down as patron of the Jewish National Fund,[188][189] becoming the first British prime minister not to be patron of the charity in the 110 years of its existence.[190]
Despite these events, David Cameron is perhaps the most outspoken supporter of Israel in a whole generation of PMs. In a speech in 2011 Cameron said: "You have a Prime Minister whose commitment and determination to work for peace in Israel is deep and strong. Britain will continue to push for peace, but will always stand up for Israel against those who wish her harm". He said he wanted to reaffirm his "unshakable" belief in Israel within the same message.[191] He also voiced his opposition to the Goldstone Report, claiming it had been biased against Israel and not enough blame had been placed on Hamas.
In March 2014, during his first visit to Israel as Prime Minister, Cameron addressed Israel's Knesset in Jerusalem, where he offered his full support for peace efforts between Israelis and Palestinians, hoping a two state solution might be achieved.[192] He also made clear his rejection of trade or academic boycotts against Israel,[193] acknowledged Israel's right to defend its citizens as "a right enshrined in international law," and made note of the Balfour Declaration of 1917, as "the moment when the State of Israel went from a dream to a plan, Britain has played a proud and vital role in helping to secure Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people."[192] During his two-day visit, he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.[194]
David Cameron was given a score of 36% in favour of lesbian, gay and bisexual equality by Stonewall in 2010.[195] Cameron voted to retain Section 28 and voted against gay adoption, but he supported commitment for gay couples in a 2005 speech, and in October 2011 urged Conservative MPs to support gay marriage. In a keynote speech in Manchester he said that he backed gay marriage not in spite of his conservatism but because he is a conservative, and claimed it was about equality.[196] However, Cameron opposes equality for heterosexuals to be able to enter into civil partnerships.[197]
In December 2012 he stated that he wanted to give religious groups the ability to host gay marriage ceremonies, and that he did not want to exclude gay people from a "great institution".[198] In November 2012, Cameron and Nick Clegg agreed to fast-track legislation for introducing same-sex marriage.[199] In 2013, the Bill was presented to the House of Commons and less than 50% of Conservative MPs backed his proposals for gay marriage including his own cabinet ministers Owen Paterson and David Jones.[200]
In August 2013, he rejected calls by gay activist Stephen Fry to strip Russia from hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics due to its anti-gay laws.[201] Cameron did not attend the games but denied it was a boycott in protest at Russia's laws, having previously raised the issue of gay rights in the country with Vladimir Putin.[202]
Cameron said immigration from outside the EU should be subject to annual limits. He said: "... in the last decade we have had an immigration policy that's completely lax. The pressure it puts on our public services and communities is too great."[203] In a 2013 news story, The Independent reported, "The increase was noted as Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May said they wanted to reduce net migration from non-EU countries to less than 100,000 before the next election in 2015. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that approximately 176,000 migrants entered the UK in the year to December 2012, up from 153,000 in the year to September 2012."[204]
During the leadership election, allegations were made that Cameron had used cannabis and cocaine recreationally before becoming an MP.[205] Pressed on this point during the BBC television programme Question Time, Cameron expressed the view that everybody was allowed to "err and stray" in their past.[206] During his 2005 Conservative leadership campaign he addressed the question of drug consumption by remarking that "I did lots of things before I came into politics which I shouldn't have done. We all did."[206]
In 2007 Cameron appointed Andy Coulson, former editor of the News of the World, as his director of communications. Coulson had resigned as the paper's editor following the conviction of a reporter in relation to illegal phone hacking, although stating that he knew nothing about it.[207][208] In June 2010 Downing Street confirmed Coulson's annual salary as £140,000, the highest pay of any special adviser to UK Government.[209]
In January 2011 Coulson left his post, saying coverage of the phone-hacking scandal was making it difficult to give his best to the job.[207] In July 2011 he was arrested and questioned by police in connection with further allegations of illegal activities at the News of the World, and released on bail. Despite a call to apologise for hiring Coulson by the leader of the opposition Ed Miliband, Cameron defended the appointment, saying that he had taken a conscious choice to give someone who had screwed up a second chance[210] On 20 July, in a special parliamentary session at the House of Commons, arranged to discuss the News of the World phone hacking scandal, Cameron said that he "regretted the furore" that had resulted from his appointment of Coulson, and that "with hindsight" he would not have hired him.[211] Coulson was detained and charged with perjury by Strathclyde Police on 30 May 2012.[212][213]
Although Lord Ashcroft played a significant role in the 2010 election, he wasn't offered a ministerial post.[214] In June 2012, shortly before a major Tory rebellion on House of Lords reform,[215] journalist Peter Oborne credited Ashcroft with "stopping the Coalition working" by moving policy on Europe, welfare, education, taxation to the right.[214] According to Oborne, Ashcroft, owner of both the ConservativeHome and PoliticsHome websites and a "brutal critic of the Coalition from the start", had established "megaphone presence" in the on-line media. He believes Cameron's philosophy of liberal conservatism has been destroyed by "coordinated attacks on the Coalition" and "the two parties are no longer trying to pretend that they are governing together."[214] In the Observer, Andrew Rawnsley believes that Ashcroft uses carefully timed opinion polls to "generate publicity", "stir trouble for the prime minister" and influence the direction of the party.[216]
In the 2012 local elections, the Conservative Party's share of the vote fell from 35% to 31%, losing control of several councils including Plymouth, Southampton, Harlow, Redditch, Worcester and Great Yarmouth, after a difficult few months for the government which included the Budget, the cash-for-access scandal and the Jeremy Hunt scandal, with Labour increasing its lead in the polls. Many Conservative MPs spoke out because of this, and Nadine Dorries warned the Prime Minister that a leadership challenge could happen.[217]
David Davies also joined in the criticism of Cameron's leadership "incompetence at the highest levels of Government". In the summer, chatter continued after the House of Lords reform rebellion and the resurgence of Boris Johnson during the 2012 Olympics. It was revealed that Boris Johnson and Zac Goldsmith had been talking about a possible leadership challenge to the Prime Minister, through a resignation from Goldsmith over airports policy, opening up a by-election for Johnson to stand.[218] Colonel Bob Stewart revealed that two Tory MPs had asked him to stand as a stalking-horse candidate against the Prime Minister. It was also revealed that the chairman of the 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, had received letters from 14 Tory MPs calling for a 'vote of no confidence' in the Prime Minister, and Patrick Mercer was one of the signatories.[citation needed]
Later that year, Brian Binley openly said that Cameron's leadership was like being a 'maid' to the Liberal Democrats, and accused him of leading the party to defeat. In January 2013 it was revealed that Adam Afriyie was planning his own bid for the Tory leadership with the support of fellow MPs Mark Field, Bill Wiggin, Chris Heaton-Harris, Priti Patel, Jonathan Djanogly and Dan Byles. In the same month, The Times and ConservativeHome revealed that a 'rebel reserve' of 55 Tory MPs had given firm pledges to a coordinating MP to support a motion of 'no confidence' and write to Brady simultaneously, which would be enough MPs to trigger a vote of no confidence as the level of MPs needed to trigger such vote is 46.[219] After the Conservative Party came third in the Eastleigh by-election, one of its target seats, it was revealed that 25 MPs were considering joining calls for a vote of no confidence by the summer. Theresa May was seen as a potential challenger for the leadership, after her speech to a ConservativeHome conference in March 2013.
In the county council elections in May 2013, the Conservatives suffered large losses in key heartland territory, while UKIP began to rise. As a result, some county councillors and former councillors went out of their way to attack the Prime Minister and even called for him to step down. Nigel Farage, the leader of UKIP, said that he would enter into an electoral pact with the Conservative Party in 2015 on condition that David Cameron stepped down as leader. Conservative MPs Jacob Rees-Mogg and Peter Bone called for a pact, and Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan called for a 'Unite The Right' alliance in spite of what Farage said. In June 2013, Andrew Bridgen publicly called for David Cameron's resignation and wrote a letter calling for a 'vote of no confidence' in the Prime Minister's leadership. In 2014, Norman Tebbit called for David Cameron to resign before the 2015 General Election and asked Conservative MPs to support a 'vote of no confidence'.
In 2014, Cameron dismissed warnings that his cuts to the UK defence budget had left it less than a "first class-player in terms of defence" and no longer a "full partner" to the United States.[220]
In the first month of Cameron's leadership, the Conservative Party's standing in opinion polls rose, with several pollsters placing it ahead of the ruling Labour Party. While the Conservative and Labour Parties drew even in early spring 2006, following the May 2006 local elections various polls once again generally showed Conservative leads.[221][222]
When Gordon Brown became Prime Minister on 27 June 2007, Labour moved ahead and its ratings grew steadily at Cameron's expense, an ICM poll[223] in July showing Labour with a seven-point lead in the wake of controversies over his policies. An ICM poll[224][225] in September saw Cameron rated the least popular of the three main party leaders. A YouGov poll for Channel 4 one week later, after the Labour Party Conference, extended the Labour lead to 11 points, prompting further speculation of an early election.[226]
Following the Conservative Party Conference in the first week of October 2007, the Conservatives drew level with Labour[227] When Brown declared he would not call an election for the autumn,[228] a decline in his and Labour's standings followed. At the end of the year a series of polls showed improved support for the Conservatives giving them an 11-point lead over Labour. This decreased slightly in early 2008,[229] and in March the Conservatives had their largest lead in opinion polls since October 1987, at 16 points.[230] In May 2008, following the worst local election performance from the Labour Party in 40 years, the Conservative lead was up to 26 points, the largest since 1968.[231]
In December 2008, a ComRes poll showed the Conservative lead had decreased dramatically,[232] though by February 2009 it had recovered to reach 12 points.[233] A period of relative stability in the polls was broken in mid-December 2009, and by January 2010 some polls were predicting a hung parliament[234]
A YouGov poll on party leaders conducted on 9–10 June 2011 found 44% of the electorate thought he was doing well and 50% thought he was doing badly, whilst 38% thought he would be the best PM, 23% preferred Ed Miliband and 35% didn't know.[235]
Until his veto on treaty changes to the European Union in December 2011 amid the Eurozone crisis, most opinion polls that year had shown a slim Labour lead. Many opinion polls showed that the majority of voters felt that Cameron made the right decision. Subsequent opinion polls have shown a narrow lead for the Conservatives ahead of Labour.[236] In March 2012, following a very unpopular Budget, Labour began to increase its standing in the polls and the Conservatives trailed by 10%. Since, then Labour has been constantly ahead of the Conservatives, the most recent YouGov poll putting Labour 15% ahead.
A 2013 Mumsnet poll found that British women saw Cameron out of touch with the issues that matter to them with a resulting sharp decline in support for the Tories due to his policies.[237]
Cameron is married to Samantha Gwendoline Sheffield, the daughter of Sir Reginald Sheffield, 8th Baronet and Annabel Lucy Veronica Jones (now Viscountess Astor). A Marlborough College school friend of Cameron's sister Clare, Samantha accepted Clare's invitation to accompany the Cameron family on holiday in Tuscany, Italy, after graduating from Bristol School of Creative Arts. It was then David and Samantha's romance started. They were wed on 1 June 1996 at the Church of St. Augustine of Canterbury, East Hendred, Oxfordshire, five years before he became an MP.[6]
The Camerons have had four children. Their first, Ivan Reginald Ian, was born on 8 April 2002 in Hammersmith and Fulham, London,[238] with a rare combination of cerebral palsy and a form of severe epilepsy called Ohtahara syndrome, requiring round-the-clock care. Recalling the receipt of this news, Cameron was quoted as saying: "The news hits you like a freight train ... You are depressed for a while because you are grieving for the difference between your hopes and the reality. But then you get over that, because he's wonderful."[239] Ivan died at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, on 25 February 2009, aged six.[240]
The Camerons have two daughters, Nancy Gwen (born 2004), and Florence Rose Endellion (born 24 August 2010),[241] and a son, Arthur Elwen (born 2006).[242] Cameron took paternity leave when his second son was born, and this decision received broad coverage.[243] It was also stated that Cameron would be taking paternity leave after his second daughter was born.[241] His second daughter, Florence Rose Endellion, was born on 24 August 2010, three weeks prematurely, while the family was on holiday in Cornwall. Her third given name, Endellion, is taken from the village of St Endellion near where the Camerons were holidaying.[244][245]
An estimate of his worth is £3.2 million, though this figure excludes the million-pound legacies Cameron is expected to inherit from both sides of his family.[246]
In early May 2008, David Cameron decided to enrol his daughter Nancy at a State school. The Camerons had been attending its associated church,[247] which is near the Cameron family home in North Kensington, for three years.[248] Cameron's constituency home is in Dean, Oxfordshire, and the Camerons are key members of the Chipping Norton set.[249]
On 8 September 2010, it was announced that Cameron would miss Prime Minister's Questions in order to fly to southern France to see his father, Ian Cameron, who had suffered a stroke with coronary complications. Later that day, with David and other family members at his bedside, Ian died.[250] On 17 September 2010, Cameron attended a private ceremony for the funeral of his father in Berkshire, which prevented him from hearing the address of the Pope to Westminster Hall, an occasion he would otherwise have attended.[251]
Cameron supports Aston Villa Football Club.[252] Cameron is also a keen cricket fan and has appeared on Test Match Special.[253]
He regularly uses his bicycle to commute to work. In early 2006, he was photographed cycling to work followed by his driver in a car carrying his belongings. His Conservative Party spokesperson subsequently said that this was a regular arrangement for Cameron at the time.[254] Cameron's bicycle was stolen in May 2009 while he was shopping. It was recovered with the aid of The Sunday Mirror.[255] His bicycle has since been stolen again from near his house.[256] He is an occasional jogger and has raised funds for charities by taking part in the Oxford 5K and the Great Brook Run.[257]
At a Q&A in August 2013 Cameron described himself as a practising Christian and an active member of the Church of England.[258] On religious faith in general he has said: "I do think that organised religion can get things wrong but the Church of England and the other churches do play a very important role in society."[259] He says he considers the Bible "a sort of handy guide" on morality.[260] He views the U.K as a "Christian country" putting faith back into politics.[261]

He may speak the language of modernity and change, but in many ways Britain's new prime minister David Cameron is a throwback to an earlier era of Conservative leaders.Not only is he the first former pupil of Britain's top private school, Eton, to hold the office since the early 1960s, he can also trace his ancestry back to William IV, making him a distant relative of the Queen. Mr Cameron has never made any secret of his privileged background, but he has also sought to cultivate a fresh, unstuffy image. At 43, he is the youngest prime minister since Robert Banks Jenkinson, the 2nd Earl of Liverpool in 1812. He is six months younger than Tony Blair when he entered Downing Street in 1997. Like Mr Blair, he has a young family and an informal, self-consciously modern approach to politics. Mr Blair arrived at Number 10 with a guitar case in hand. Mr Cameron has his cycling helmet on his handlebars and fondness for indie rock. Yet despite opening himself up to the TV cameras like few other British political leaders, Mr Cameron is still something of an unknown quantity. 'Happy childhood'Friends talk of a witty, self-deprecating character, a devoted family man who loves to throw weekend parties at his Oxfordshire constituency home and who hates "talking shop".
Political career:1988: Conservative Research Department 1992: Treasury special adviser1993: Home Office special adviser1997: General election candidate, Stafford2001: Elected MP for Witney, Oxfordshire 2003: Shadow deputy leader of the House, Tory vice-chairman2005: Shadow education secretary, election campaign co-ordinator, wins party leadership 2010: Prime Minister
But some who have had dealings with him on his rise to power, and during his brief career in business, recall a "slippery", "ruthlessly ambitious", somewhat guarded individual. So who is the real David Cameron? The third of four children, David William Duncan Cameron, was born on 9 October 1966 in London. He spent the first three years of his life in Kensington and Chelsea before the family moved to an old rectory near Newbury, in Berkshire. Mr Cameron has said he had a "happy childhood", but one where "whingeing was not on the menu". His stockbroker father Ian was born with severely deformed legs, which he eventually had to have amputated. He has also lost the sight in one eye, but David's father said he never considered himself "disabled" and rarely complained about anything. Mr Cameron's mother, Mary, served as a Justice of the Peace for 30 years. During her time on the bench she passed judgement on the Greenham Common protesters, including on one occasion her own sister, Mr Cameron revealed recently, and eco-warrior Swampy, who was protesting against the construction of the Newbury bypass. 'Mainstream Conservative'At the age of seven, the young Cameron was packed off to Heatherdown, a highly exclusive preparatory school, which counted Princes Edward and Andrew among its pupils. Then, following in the family tradition, came Eton. School friends say Mr Cameron was never seen as a great academic - or noted for his interest in politics, beyond the "mainstream Conservative" views held by most of his classmates.
I'm a practical person, and pragmatic. I know where I want to get to to, but I am not ideologically attached to one particular method

He has described his 12 O-levels as "not very good", but he gained three As at A-level, in history, history of art and economics with politics. Reportedly his biggest mention in the Eton school magazine came when he sprained his ankle dancing to bagpipes on a school trip to Rome. Before going up to Oxford to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics he took a gap year, working initially for Sussex Conservative MP Tim Rathbone, before spending three months in Hong Kong, working for a shipping agent, and then returning by rail via the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. At Oxford, he avoided student politics because, according to one friend from the time, Steve Rathbone, "he wanted to have a good time". He was captain of Brasenose College's tennis team and a member of the Bullingdon dining club, famed for its hard drinking and bad behaviour, an episode Mr Cameron has always refused to talk about. He has also consistently dodged the question of whether he took drugs at university. But he evidently did not let his extra-curricular activities get in the way of his studies. His tutor at Oxford, Professor Vernon Bogdanor, describes him as "one of the ablest" students he has taught, whose political views were "moderate and sensible Conservative". After gaining a first class degree, he briefly considered a career in journalism or banking, before answering an advertisement for a job in the Conservative Research Department. 'Brat pack'Conservative Central Office is reported to have received a telephone call on the morning of his interview in June 1988, from an unnamed male at Buckingham Palace, who said: "I understand you are to see David Cameron. "I've tried everything I can to dissuade him from wasting his time on politics but I have failed. I am ringing to tell you that you are about to meet a truly remarkable young man." Mr Cameron says he did not know the call was being made or who made it, but it is sometimes held up by his opponents as an example of his gilded passage to the top. As a researcher, Mr Cameron was seen as hard-working and bright. He worked with future shadow home secretary David Davis on the team briefing John Major for Prime Minister's Questions, and also hooked up with George Osborne, who would go on to be shadow chancellor and his leadership campaign manager. Other colleagues, in what became known as the "brat pack" were Steve Hilton, now one of Mr Cameron's closest strategy advisers, and Andrew Lansley, expected to be the new health secretary. These young researchers were credited with devising the attack on Labour tax plans that unexpectedly swung the 1992 general election for John Major. Mr Major described Cameron as an "an extraordinarily able and bright young man," and praised his "coolness and his capacity to think under pressure." 'Board material'But the remainder of Mr Cameron's time as a backroom boy in the Conservative government was more turbulent. He was poached by then Chancellor Norman Lamont as a political adviser, and was at Mr Lamont's side throughout Black Wednesday, which saw the pound crash out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
He's not someone - and most Englishmen aren't - who talks freely and easily in the open-hearted Oprahesque fashion that some do but he's extremely good company
By the early 1990s, Mr Cameron had decided he wanted to be an MP himself, but he also knew it was vital to gain experience outside of politics. So after a brief spell as an adviser to then home secretary Michael Howard, he took a job in public relations with ITV television company Carlton. Mr Cameron spent seven years at Carlton, as head of corporate communications, travelling the world with the firm's boss Michael Green, who has described him as "board material". "I tried to persuade him that he could have a really good career in industry, but he was completely resolute about going back to politics, and I respected him for that. He's good, he's the real McCoy," Mr Green told The Independent. But Mr Cameron's period at Carlton is not remembered so fondly by some of the journalists who had to deal with him. Jeff Randall, writing in The Daily Telegraph in 2005, said he would not trust Mr Cameron "with my daughter's pocket money". "To describe Cameron's approach to corporate PR as unhelpful and evasive overstates by a wide-ish margin the clarity and plain-speaking that he brought to the job of being Michael Green's mouthpiece," wrote the ex-BBC business editor. Former Sun business editor Ian King, recalling the same era, has described Mr Cameron as a "poisonous, slippery individual". Mr Cameron went part-time from his job at Carlton in 1997 to unsuccessfully contest Stafford at that year's general election. DedicationFour years later, in 2001, he won the safe Conservative seat of Witney, in Oxfordshire, recently vacated by Sean Woodward, who had defected to Labour. Mr Cameron was by now a married man with a family. His wife, Samantha, is the daughter of landowner Sir Reginald Sheffield. She grew up on the 300 acre Normanby Hall estate, near Scunthorpe.
Drink: Guinness and real ale. Luxury item on Desert Island Discs was "a case of malt whisky from Jura"
Her stepfather, Viscount Astor, was a minister in John Major's government, with responsibility for broadcasting. Before becoming Tory leader in 2005, Mr Cameron sat on the board of late night bar operator Urbium with Viscount Astor. Mrs Cameron, who works as the creative director of upmarket stationery firm Smythson's of Bond Street, which counts Stella McCartney, Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell among its clients, has been credited with transforming her husband's "Tory boy" image. She has a tattoo on her ankle and went to art school in Bristol, where she says she was taught to play pool by rap star Tricky. The couple were introduced by Mr Cameron's sister Clare, Samantha's best friend, at a party at the Cameron family home. They were married in 1996. They have two young children, Nancy and Arthur, with another baby due in September. Their first child, Ivan, who was born profoundly disabled and needed round the clock care, died in February 2009. The experience of caring for Ivan and witnessing at first hand the dedication of NHS hospital staff, is said by friends to have broadened Mr Cameron's horizons. He had, friends say, led an almost charmed life, to that point. Leadership contestIn a message to party activists after Ivan's death, Mr Cameron said: "When we were first told the extent of Ivan's disability I thought that we would suffer having to care for him but at least he would benefit from our care. "Now as I look back I see that it was all the other way round. It was only him that ever really suffered and it was us - Sam, me, Nancy and Elwen - who gained more than I ever believed possible from having and loving such a wonderfully special and beautiful boy."
On entering Parliament in 2001, Mr Cameron rose rapidly through the ranks, serving first on the Home Affairs Select Committee, which recommended the liberalisation of drug laws. He was taken under the wing of Michael Howard, who put him in charge of policy coordination and then made him shadow education secretary. He also had the key role of drafting the 2005 election manifesto. But when he entered the race to succeed Mr Howard as party leader in 2005 few initially gave him a chance. He was a distant fourth at the bookmakers behind Ken Clarke, Liam Fox and frontrunner David Davis. It took an eye-catching conference speech, delivered without notes, in what would become his trademark style, to change the minds of the party faithful. A few may have had second thoughts, when in the early months of his leadership he spoke about how some young offenders just needed love (caricatured by his opponents as his "hug a hoodie" speech) and was pictured with huskies in the Arctic Circle on a trip to investigate climate change. FashionableAt the start of his leadership, Mr Cameron was all about sunny optimism and "sharing the proceeds of growth". He told activists in his first party conference speech to "let sunshine win the day" and managed to get a round of applause for a mention of civil partnerships. The media, eager for a new story after years of Tory failure and with an increasingly unpopular Labour government, gave him the glowing coverage he craved, helping him to "decontaminate" the Tory brand and move the party back towards the centre ground, where, the conventional wisdom has it, British elections are won and lost. He ordered the party to end its obsession with Europe and tried to reposition it as the party of the environment and the NHS, as well as recruiting more women and candidates from ethnic minorities to winnable seats.
He also cannily used the expenses scandal that rocked Westminster to portray himself as a radical reformer bent on cleaning up politics. He was helped in his mission by many older, more traditionally-minded Tory MPs being forced to retire to make way for younger "Notting Hill Tories" - as Mr Cameron's fashionable, Metropolitan supporters came to be called. He was rewarded with big poll leads - but the financial crisis forced Mr Cameron to ditch much of his upbeat rhetoric, in favour of a more sober, even gloomy, approach, warning voters they face tough times and spending cuts ahead. Despite his change of tone, and with the exception of a brief period when Gordon Brown enjoyed a bounce in the polls after becoming leader in 2007, Mr Cameron has ridden high in the polls throughout his time as leader. TV debatesBut during the course of the general election campaign, he watched much of that poll lead evaporate, with the rise of Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, a man with a similar background and smooth, telegenic manner. He was no longer the fresh, new face on the block. What's more, his big idea, The Big Society, the fruit of detailed policy work stretching back to the early days of his leadership, which envisaged parents setting up their own schools and groups of public sector workers forming cooperatives, failed to capture voters' imagination in the way he had hoped. But after losing out to Mr Clegg in the first televised prime ministerial debate, he managed to regain his poise and, according to most of the instant viewer polls, came out on top in the two that followed. Mr Cameron and his inner circle still had hopes of winning an outright victory, as Britain went to to the polls. But despite gaining 97 seats, the Conservatives' biggest increase in decades, they fell just short of the majority they needed to form a government and Mr Cameron was forced into coalition talks with Mr Clegg's Liberal Democrats. Before he was elected Conservative leader in 2005, David Cameron famously described himself as the "heir to Blair". There are certainly similarities with the way he has used a small group of modernisers to force change on a reluctant party, even if it did not, in the end, produce the same seismic effect at the ballot box. And like Mr Blair in his early days, Mr Cameron's political philosophy is sometimes difficult to pin down. He recently told The Daily Telegraph he did not trust people with a "grand vision," saying he was "a practical person, and pragmatic". If he could sum up his approach to politics in one word, he told the newspaper, it would be "responsibility". He may learn the true meaning of that word in the weeks and months to come.

 David Cameron is the London born, Eton educated, Prime Minister and MP for Witney who believes he’s the handyman to fix UK PLC and sort out ‘broken Britain’. But is there more to this progressive, caring Conservative than his Thatcher-lite, Blair-like image? There was a time, before Iraq, when Britain was booming, that admitting to being a ‘nice but dim Tim Tory’ card-carrying member of the ‘Nasty Party’ was social suicide. So meet the man who remade the Conservative Party a political force ready to take national power.
	Perhaps the most admirable characteristic of this father of three is that he refrained from making political capital out of his most painful personal experience. His eldest son, Ivan, suffered from cerebral palsy which meant David experienced first-hand both the best and the worst of the NHS. Since Ivan’s death, aged just six, David has commented on the shortfalls in the system but with a remarkable restraint and it’s this commitment to the NHS which has differentiated him from previous Conservatives and made him acceptable to many swing voters. (When columnist Peter Hitchens read how stoically David dealt with Ivan, he publicly apologised for his earlier comments that David had never been tested.)
	David Cameron was born Conservative. Not only has he connections to royalty, but there are three conspicuous Conservative MPs in the family tree. His disabled stockbroker father welcomed in the future fourth one in October 1966. David spent his first three years in Kensington and Chelsea before moving to Berkshire. His childhood featured a nanny and a swimming pool, and his education was prep school, Eton and then Oxford. He’d spent his gap year before university working for a Sussex MP, and a shipping agent in Hong Kong, returning from there by rail through Eastern Europe.
David’s Oxford tutor for Philosophy, Politics and Economics remembers him as politically moderate but critics seize on his time in the notorious Bullingdon club. His membership of this exclusive clique, where wealth is prerequisite and excess is characteristic, is seen by some as proof that he was a hardcore, right wing, free-market Thatcherite disciple. That embarrassing and infamous photo of him with, amongst others, Boris Johnson, now London Mayor, must be seen in context. The 80s were a decade where the Left Wing of politics virtually vanished and, more importantly, how many present day professionals would include their student photos in their CV? He has understandably remained quiet over claims he smoked cannabis (or took cocaine), citing the right to a private life before he entered politics.
In 1988, he left Oxford with a First and secured a research job with the Conservative Party. He progressed to special adviser for the Treasury and then Home Office finding he had a particular affinity for preparing ministers for media appearances. But Cameron wasn’t always successful. He allowed his Chancellor boss, Norman Lamont, to respond ‘Je ne regrette rien’ to an economic question post the billion pound blunder that was Black Wednesday. Lamont mangled the pronunciation and came across as doubly incompetent. Cameron also wrote him a storming speech that, due to technical reasons, went disastrously. Cameron learnt from these two lessons. Firstly, the media message is everything, and secondly, never, ever rely on a script. Cameron’s later apparently off-the-cuff speeches would be the making of him. And while Cameron’s backroom ascent was anything but assured, he always showed relentless energy.
Having found his vocation, in 1993 he then met the love of his life, the tattoo sporting, trip-hop Tricky friend, and a baronet’s daughter, Samantha Sheffield. She’d been raised on an estate, a 300 acre one, and boasted a bloodline that rivalled his. David wanted marriage immediately. She agreed in 1996.
Samantha’s step father had ministerial responsibility for broadcasting, and both he and her mother were helpful when David decided to gain business experience as a spin doctor for a big UK media company, Carlton Communications, which had the ITV franchise. Inevitably, many journalists don’t remember his time there with fondness but his boss, TV tycoon Michael Green, thought him a shrewd operator and offered him a career. But after seven years there, and with enough world experience to deflect criticism that he was merely a career politician, David decided it was time to return to the fray.
	Unfortunately for David, he returned to politics just as the country turned red. He lost his North Birmingham Stafford ‘safe’ seat in the 1997 New Labour bloodbath. What his Party and leaders did next was to make many (William Hague), many, (Ian Duncan Smith), many (Michael Howard) mistakes. The only consolation for Cameron during these wilderness years was that it was a textbook of how not to do it. His Party would endure two more election defeats, in 2001 and 2005, before they were ready to look for salvation in an unexpected corner.
In June 2001, he became MP for the Witney, an Oxfordshire market town. Over the following years, he occupied a number of shadow jobs, from finance to education, and it was during his time as policy co-ordinator that he almost imperceptibly began the Party’s shift to the centre.
But his ascent to leadership was inauspicious. He himself said he could have got his supporters in the back of a London taxi with a bit of room to spare. However, he had learnt from Lamont’s speech misfortune and he addressed the Party conference without notes. It propelled him from underdog to front-runner and just five years after being elected an MP, he was elected leader of the Opposition in December 2005.
But throughout August and September 2007, it looked like his brief stay at the top could end if Brown capitalised on soaring ratings. Cameron responded by addressing his troops at the Party conference without the armour of an autocue. Brown blinked. Cameron capitalised on the indecision, swiftly circulating the message that Brown had ‘bottled’ it.
Cameron relentlessly held onto the lead he thus secured. He will now not even allow a Party member to drink champagne for fear that cameras will capture it and suggest his chaps are comfortable in their success.
	There is a contradiction in Cameron. He represents exactly the uncaring, moneyed classes that were rejected by voters as unrepresentative over three elections, and yet, it is Cameron that has repositioned himself as an everyman (by chatting away on ‘Mumsnet’ and ‘Webcameron’), and his Party as drawn from the electorate (by increasing ethnic and female candidates). He’s in sharp contrast to previous leaders like Heath, Thatcher and Major, who boasted ordinary backgrounds as their pedigree. David Cameron hopes to lead the UK as a Conservative PM, the likes of which have not been seen Harold Macmillan and his Etonian cabinet in the early 60s. But Cameron’s media expertise means that even if he fails to present himself as classless, he has succeeded in presenting himself as not of his class. Not surprisingly, establishing the core beliefs of this chameleon is not easy.
His Conservative bio page spouts the usual meaningless slogans common to all politicians. For example, he believes there is a need for change in times of recession and for cutting red tape, as if anyone promoted staying stagnant and stifling bureaucracy. There’s the usual dogmatic Conservative belief in the reduction of taxes which many believe the practicalities of recession will erode.
	What is known is that while he may be predictably right wing on the economy, he’s unusually liberal on drugs and gays, at least for a Conservative leader. He’s said sorry for Section 28, the Tory legislation that banned promotion of homosexuality in schools. And he hasn’t stopped there. He’s said sorry for:
	• Criticising the estate from which Karen Mathews came (the shameless mother who conspired in kidnap of her daughter for publicity and profit)
	• Not realising the recession was coming (but that was more of a political manoeuvre to embarrass the PM Brown for his time as Chancellor.)
Some may see all of the above as meaningless utterances designed simply to win votes but he was genuinely risking opprobrium from the right of his Party for some of the above. For there are many hardliners, such as Lord Tebbit, waiting for him to make a mistake and restore their Party to the right.
	Cameron emerged remarkably unscathed from the MPs’ expenses scandal, having only to repay for, among other things, claiming for the clearing of wisteria from the chimney of one of his homes. Many ask why he needs to claim anything considering it’s claimed the Camerons are worth £30m. This widely circulated figure is inaccurate in that it refers to their wider family wealth. But even if this is so, it again highlights the almost inconceivable moneyed world which he considers normal.
But that is not what the media focused on. Instead, they went for the aristocratic country house owning, moat cleaning, old guard of the Tories (as well, of course, as the greedy New Labour MPs.) It’s been suggested that Cameron, ever the Machiavellian, actually used the bad news story of MPs expenses to bury many of his ‘greyer’ political rivals who resisted his modernising efforts.
If anything, it has been his financial allies, such as the billionaire from Belize, the million pound donor to the Conservative Party, that have caused the most economic embarrassment to Cameron. The non domicile Lord has, quite legally, avoided paying millions in taxes. Not really what Cameron meant when he stated the Conservatives were still a party of low taxes.
	The red in tooth and claw rivalries of whether to join in or to jettison Europe helped make the Conservatives unelectable. It’s this threat that history will repeat itself that has helped Cameron unite his factions. A federal Europe of one currency may be friend or foe, but it is an academic enemy as long as there remains the real and present danger of yet another New Labour government.
But the emerging superpowers of China and India threaten the US hegemony under which the UK enjoyed a superficial splendid isolation. Despite this, Cameron has taken the calculated risk of distancing himself from his natural allies in Europe, the centre right politics of German Chancellor Angela Merkl and French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Personally, Cameron has always been as Euro sceptic as Thatcher and politically, this move plays well with his rank and file. His adversity to economic union with Europe was undoubtedly informed by his professional experience of seeing his then boss, Norman Lamont, and his country’s currency, humiliatingly withdrawn from the European Exchange on 1992s Black Wednesday at a cost of over three billion pounds. (And before the Credit Crunch, that was considered a lot of money)
Cameron has said that he won’t abandon the EU, but he certainly won’t adopt the Euro. He will try to repatriate some of the social policy appropriated by Europe and his fundamental opposition to the centralisation inherent in the Lisbon Treaty will cause external conflict with amongst others, France and Germany. It has also resulted in some very odd new extremist allies in Europe who are diametrically opposed to his socially liberal viewpoint. (The Latvian Fatherland and Freedom Party is one, and as their name suggests, they are not renowned for their ethnically tolerant views.) But for now, his achievement is in reconciling the conflicting interests within his own Party and turning them from laughing stock to leading in the polls.
	Airbrushed posters of Cameron campaign posters saying ‘We can’t go on like this’ were similarly retouched by the public with satirical slogans added. Interestingly, for a medium noted for its bile, the majority of online contributions have a warm humour, showing affection rather than aversion. David Cameron says on his website that his greatest achievement is ‘getting the Conservative Party listened to again’. The former spin master may not always be in control of the message but there’s no doubting the fact that he’s redrawn the UK political scene around his own image.
	In 2010, after 18 years absence, Cameron took the Conservatives back into power...sort of. His coalition, the first in over 50 years, with Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems has been an uneasy and sometimes unwieldy alliance.
	Three years before the coalition government, Cameron had hired Andy Coulson, former editor of the now infamous tabloid News of the World, as director of his communications. As the phone hacking scandal built, Coulson was an early casualty in 2011. The resulting spotlight exposed a cosy elite of politicians, press and police. Cameron’s relationship with Rebekah Brooks, another former News of the World editor further damaged the Prime Minister. His embarrassing texts to her made front page news. Critics pointed out that the Prime Minister had hired and socialised with people later charged with perjury and phone hacking.
His veto in December 2012 on treaty changes in the European Union may have won him popular support, but it deeply irritated Clegg. Then again, Cameron had exactly the reverse effect with his promotion of gay marriage. Many, including liberals and homosexuals, were in disbelief that he expended so much political capital. But he did. And in February 2013, the Commons backed him.
In austerity Britain, however, it’s often economics, rather than politics that dominate. And here, despite the deficit, Cameron found himself as impotent as other politicians in dealing with everything from billion pound corporate tax avoiders to bankers’ bonuses. 
He never said ‘hug a hoodie’. That was a tabloid headline sarcastically summarising his sentiments.   
Response to whether he’d taken hard drugs before becoming a politician."I have said all I want to say about this." 
"I regret that my government driver took some of my papers home while I was on my bike... Sometimes maybe I put off making decisions that maybe I should have taken earlier." 
Fast Facts: David Cameron may be related to royalty but his favourite album is The Smiths, “The Queen is Dead’
But after he picked ‘This Charming Man’ on Desert Island Discs, the band’s guitarist Johnny Marr forbade him from listening to them. In February 2013, Cameron announced that as he’s got the full box set, he will be ignoring the ban.

David Cameron was born in London but grew up in Berkshire. He attended Eton and then received a first class degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Oxford in 1988. After Oxford, Cameron jumped right into politics with a job in the research department of the Conservative Party. From 1990-97 he worked in corporate communications for the TV company Carlton, but left the company to return to politics. David Cameron was elected as a Member of Parliament for Witney, Oxfordshire in 2001.  Regarded as a blast of fresh young (and moderate) air for the stuffy old Conservative Party, he was named party leader in 2005; he was often compared to Tony Blair, who played a similarly rejuvenating role for the Labour Party a decade earlier. The Conservative Party made an unexpectedly strong showing in the elections of 6 May 2010, and Cameron emerged as the new prime minister when Gordon Brown resigned on 11 May 2010.Extra credit: David Cameron married the former Samantha Sheffield in 1996. Their son Ivan was born in 2002 with cerebral palsy and epilepsy; Ivan died on 25 February 2009.

IntroductionEarly life and start in politicsCameron’s revitalization of the ConservativesPrime ministershipThe Conservative–Liberal Democratic coalition governmentRift in the coalitionStaying out of Syria
David Cameron, in full David William Donald Cameron   (born October 9, 1966, London, England), British Conservative Party leader who served as prime minister of the United Kingdom (2010– ).
Cameron, a descendant of King William IV, was born into a family with both wealth and an aristocratic pedigree. He attended Eton College and Brasenose College, Oxford, from which he graduated (1988) with a first-class degree in philosophy, politics, and economics. After Oxford he joined the Conservative Party Research Department. In 1992 he became a special adviser to Norman Lamont, then chancellor of the Exchequer, and the following year he undertook the same role for Michael Howard, then home secretary. Cameron joined the media company Carlton Communications in 1994 as director of corporate affairs. He stayed at Carlton until he entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for Witney, northwest of London.
Cameron—young, moderate, and charismatic—quickly attracted attention as the leading member of a new generation of Conservatives. He was widely compared to Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, who had acquired a similar reputation when he entered Parliament 18 years earlier. After just two years as an MP, Cameron was appointed to his party’s “front bench”—making him a leading Conservative spokesman in the House of Commons. In 2004 Howard, by then party leader, appointed his young protégé to the post of head of policy coordination, which put Cameron in charge of preparing the Conservatives’ 2005 election manifesto. The party, however, suffered a heavy defeat at the polls, provoking Howard’s resignation. Cameron’s self-assured speech at the party’s annual conference in October 2005 transformed his reputation, and he was subsequently elected Conservative leader.
Cameron sought to modernize the party and shed its right-wing image. He announced that economic stability and strong public services would take priority over tax cuts in the next Conservative government. Under his leadership the party grew in popularity and placed first in the 2006 local elections; it was the Conservatives’ best showing at the polls in some 15 years.
In the immediate aftermath of Gordon Brown’s succeeding Blair as Labour leader and prime minister in 2007, the Conservatives began to trail in the polls, encouraging the prime minister to consider calling a snap election to capitalize on Labour’s momentum. By the time Labour held its party conference in September, it had taken a double-digit lead over the Conservatives. But, at the Conservative Party conference in early October, Cameron made an impressive speech, talking for more than an hour without a script. In reference to the upcoming European Union summit in Lisbon to negotiate a treaty on reform, Cameron lambasted Brown for ruling out a referendum on an agreement (contrary to the prime minister’s commitment to hold one on a European constitution). In addition to other issues, Cameron also was critical of Labour’s performance on crime and with regard to the National Health Service (NHS). Most daringly, despite trailing in the polls, he goaded the prime minister to call an election:
So, Mr Brown, what’s it going to be? Why don’t you go ahead and call that election? Let the people pass judgement on 10 years of broken promises. Let people decide who’s really making the arguments about the future of our country. Let people decide who can make the changes that we really need in our country. Call that election. We will fight. Britain will win.
The performance won wide praise, and in its aftermath Brown announced that there would be no general election before 2009. Later that month, after Brown had attended the EU summit in Lisbon, at which the 27 member countries agreed on the detailed wording of the treaty, Cameron followed up with his earlier criticism, arguing that Brown had “absolutely no democratic mandate to sign this without a referendum.” By December the Conservatives had taken a clear lead in the opinion polls, ahead of Labour by up to 13 percent—the biggest lead for the Conservatives since 1989.
The global economic crisis in 2008 helped Cameron solidify the Conservatives’ position. Though Brown was widely praised outside of Britain for his approach to the crisis, his promise in 1997 that the days of economic “boom and bust” were over played to Cameron’s advantage, as did an internal revolt by Labour ministers in 2008. In March 2009 Cameron made good on a promise to remove the Conservatives from the European People’s Party, a mainstream alliance of conservative parties in the European Parliament. On June 4 the Conservatives topped the poll in the European Parliament elections, and Cameron had the Conservatives enter the legislative body as members of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group.
A parliamentary-expenses scandal, which had been brewing since 2007, broke in May 2009 when the Daily Telegraph reported on widespread abuse by members of Parliament of expense accounts meant to offset the cost of having to maintain a second residence (the so-called Additional Costs Allowance). The scandal cut across party lines, but Labour suffered the brunt of public criticism, and Cameron responded by arguing that the public had a “right to be angry.” Although the polling numbers for Cameron and the Conservatives showed a decline from peaks in early 2009, he and the party appeared to be well positioned for the general election on May 6, 2010.
Voters gave the Conservatives their biggest seat gain since 1931, but the total still fell short of an outright majority. Days of political wrangling followed the election, with negotiators from the Conservative and Labour parties courting Liberal Democratic leader Nick Clegg in an effort to form a government. On May 11, after it appeared that the prospect of a “Lib-Lab” coalition would not bear fruit, Brown resigned as prime minister and was replaced by Cameron. He came to power at the head of a Conservative–Liberal Democratic coalition government—Britain’s first coalition government since World War II—in which Clegg became deputy prime minister. The two leaders seemed to quickly become comfortable with each other, perhaps because of their shared age (both were 43) and similar backgrounds.
In June Cameron addressed Parliament in response to the report of Lord Saville’s 12-year official inquiry into the events of “Bloody Sunday,” which found that British soldiers had been responsible for the deaths of 14 nationalist demonstrators in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, in 1972 and that those demonstrators had posed no serious threat to the soldiers. “The government is ultimately responsible for the conduct of the forces,” Cameron said, “and for that, on behalf of the government—indeed, on behalf of our country—I am deeply sorry.”
One of the cornerstones of the Conservative-Liberal power-sharing agreement was a pledge to formulate a budget-reduction plan in short order. In October the man whom Cameron had appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, announced a five-year austerity plan that included Britain’s most extensive spending cuts in decades, notably reductions to welfare entitlements and layoffs of up to 500,000 public-sector employees.
Early in 2011 the Middle East and North Africa were swept by a series of popular uprisings that became known as the Arab Spring. In February Cameron became the first Western leader to visit Egypt after Hosni Mubarak was ousted from power. Another event in the region, the revolt in Libya, particularly captured the attention of Cameron, who became an outspoken critic of ruler Muammar al-Qaddafi’s brutal repression of the rebels in Libya. Cameron’s calls for military intervention in that country and especially for the imposition of a no-fly zone to protect Libyan civilians from Qaddafi’s forces were echoed by French Pres. Nicolas Sarkozy. Together they played a pivotal role in winning the UN Security Council’s authorization of a no-fly zone on March 17. Shortly thereafter a coalition of U.S. and European forces with warplanes and cruise missiles began attacking targets in Libya in an effort to disable Libya’s air force.
The results of the May 2011 local government elections in Britain, especially those for local councils in England, appeared to indicate that Conservative voters were more comfortable than Liberal Democrats with the deficit-reducing austerity measures introduced by the government. The Conservatives made moderate gains to their presence in local government, but their coalition partners experienced their worst performance at the polls since the founding of the Liberal Democrats. In the wake of the election, relations between Cameron and Clegg and their parties were widely described as having become more businesslike in nature. This cooling of coalition camaraderie was largely the result of the Conservatives’ active opposition to a Liberal Democrats-initiated referendum on a change from first-past-the-post elections to the alternative vote, which was strongly rejected by British voters.
Following the Scottish Nationalist Party’s overwhelming victory in the 2011 elections for the Scottish Parliament, Alex Salmond, the first minister of Scotland, announced that he would be forwarding a referendum on independence. Cameron announced that he would respect Scotland’s efforts in that direction but would “campaign to keep our United Kingdom together with every single fibre that I have.”
When the scandal involving the illegal hacking of telephone voice mails by reporters from the News of the World newspaper exploded in July 2011, Cameron was caught in the fallout. Andy Coulson, Cameron’s communications chief, had already left that post in January of the same year in the wake of the growing evidence tying him to the scandal. Coulson had served as the editor of the News of the World from 2003 to 2007, when he stepped down after early revelations of the phone hacking came to light. Initially, Cameron had been supportive of Coulson after he left his government post, but, as the scandal deepened in July, Cameron said that he regretted having hired Coulson. Cameron announced on July 13 that a senior judge, Lord Justice Sir Brian Leveson, would head a public inquiry into both the hacking scandal and Britain’s system of media regulation.
In early August 2011 Cameron faced a new challenge, as a profusion of neighbourhoods in and around London as well as in a number of other British cities erupted in riots characterized by widespread looting, arson, and destruction of property. The civil disorder was sparked on the night of August 6 when a protest in the North London area of Tottenham over the police shooting of a young man escalated into rioting, which began spreading the next day. “This is criminality pure and simple, and it has to be confronted and defeated,” announced Cameron on August 9 as some 16,000 policemen prepared to take to the streets of London that night. Cameron also called members of Parliament back to London for discussion of the riots. In a speech on August 15, Cameron blamed “a broken society” for a “slow-motion moral collapse.” In a separate statement he promised tougher measures, especially against people living in rented social housing in the event that any member of the family broke the law.
The Cameron government’s first major social innovation started to bear fruit in September 2011 with the opening of the first 24 “Free Schools,” which were free to students and funded by the government but able to operate independently of local councils. The government enacted another major change in October at a meeting of Commonwealth leaders in Australia, where it was agreed that the British crown could pass to the firstborn child, regardless of sex, and that the ban, more than 300 years old, on a British monarch’s marrying a Roman Catholic was no longer valid. Also in October, the retirement age was set to rise to 66 by 2020 for public-sector workers, and mandatory retirement was lifted. In December Cameron took the nearly unprecedented step of vetoing a proposal supported by the other 26 EU heads of government to amend the EU’s rules to reduce the risks of future financial crisis in the euro zone. It was the first major proposal rejected by Britain since it joined the European Community.
