Ryan John Seacrest (born December 24, 1974) is an American radio personality, television host, and producer. He hosts talent competition American Idol, as well as On Air with Ryan Seacrest, a morning radio show on KIIS-FM.[1][2][3]
He received Emmy Award nominations for American Idol, and won an Emmy for producing Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution.[4]
Seacrest was born on December 24, 1974, in an Atlanta suburb, Dunwoody, Georgia,[5] the son of Constance Marie (née Zullinger), a homemaker, and Gary Lee Seacrest, a real estate lawyer.[6][7] His mother told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, "Instead of playing with G.I. Joes or Cowboys and Indians, [Ryan] would always have a little microphone and do shows in the house."[8]
At age 14, he attended Dunwoody High School. As his school's regular morning public address system announcer, he was known as the "Voice of Dunwoody High School". [9] At aged 16, while still attending high school, Seacrest won a hard-to-get internship at WSTR (FM), in Atlanta, with Tom Sullivan, who trained him in the many aspects of radio. When the regular DJ called in sick, Sullivan put him on the air for the very first show of his broadcasting career.[10] Seacrest was given the weekend overnight shift at WSTR.[8]
Seacrest continued to work on air at WSTR until graduating from Dunwoody High School in 1992.[11] Seacrest went on to study journalism at the University of Georgia in fall 1992. He continued his radio show at a local Athens station. Seacrest left the university at age 19 and moved to Hollywood to pursue his broadcasting career.[8]
In 1993, Seacrest hosted the first season of ESPN's Radical Outdoor Challenge. He also hosted three kids' game shows, Gladiators 2000 from 1994–96 (a spinoff of the television show, American Gladiators), Wild Animal Games in 1995, and Click in 1997. Seacrest appeared as the host of the fictional game show Lover's Lane on Beverly Hills, 90210 in "The Final Proof".[12] In fall 2000, Seacrest was the host of NBC Saturday Night at the Movies.[13] From 2000 to 2001, Seacrest appeared as the host of an NBC Saturday morning television block, which broadcast a major theatrical film. During commercial breaks, he offered trivia on the film and a chance to win prizes by calling in a specific number. In 2001, he hosted a reality television program, Ultimate Revenge,[6] where elaborate practical jokes were played on family and friends instigated by their own relatives and friends. It was shown on TNN from 2001 to 2003.[12][14]
In 2002, Seacrest accepted the position as co-host of a new Fox reality television series American Idol with comedian Brian Dunkleman. American Idol went on to success, putting Seacrest in the national spotlight. The following year, he became the sole host. When the show increased in popularity, seen by some 26 million viewers weekly, Seacrest became recognizable around the world. In 2003, Seacrest hosted the spin-off show, American Juniors.[15] In July 2009, Seacrest inked a deal with CKX for $45 million to continue to host American Idol, making him the highest paid reality television host to date.[16] In April 2012, Seacrest signed a two-year, $30 million deal to stay on as host of American Idol.[17]
In August 2005, it was announced that Seacrest would become executive producer and co-host of ABC's Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve. On December 31, 2005, Seacrest performed much of the show's hosting duties. Dick Clark's role was limited by speech and mobility issues due to his recovery from a stroke. Seacrest also occasionally served as a substitute host on the CNN television program Larry King Live, and co-emceed Larry King's final show with Bill Maher on December 16, 2010.[18] In 2009, ABC renamed the program Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve With Ryan Seacrest, to reflect Seacrest's role. The 40th Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve, co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest, delivered ABC’s biggest New Year’s numbers in twelve years at 22.6 million viewers.[19]
When Dick Clark died, Seacrest publicly remembered his mentor's impact on his life in a special tribute in The Hollywood Reporter.[20] After Clark's death, Seacrest hosted the 2013 edition of Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with co-hosts Jenny McCarthy and Fergie paying tribute to Dick Clark in the pre-show.[21] In October 2013, Ryan Seacrest signed a multi-year contract extension with Dick Clark Productions to continue as host and executive producer of Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest.[22]
In January 2004, Seacrest became the new host of the radio program American Top 40,[23] a syndicated weekly countdown show, created and formerly hosted by Casey Kasem. The show was syndicated by Premiere Radio Networks. In February 2004, Seacrest became host of Los Angeles radio station KIIS's morning show, replacing long-time host Rick Dees.[24] This show, also known as On Air With Ryan Seacrest, remains on the air. Seacrest is the host, executive producer of this syndicated daily show airing on over 150 stations in North America, with affiliates worldwide.
In January 2006, US cable channel E! announced a three-year, $21 million deal for Seacrest to host and produce various programs, including E! News and its red carpet awards show coverages (E!'s signature piece of original programming).[25] That same year, Seacrest launched Ryan Seacrest Productions (RSP); in August 2008, Seacrest named his longtime William Morris Agent, Adam Sher, as CEO.[26] Comcast had first-look rights for all RSP shows through January 2012.[27] Clear Channel acquired a minority stake in RSP in early 2012, but the company no longer has a first look deal with any network.[28]
Seacrest remains managing editor of E! News and produces its red carpet awards show coverage but, as of January 2012, he no longer hosts E! News on a daily basis.[29]
In April 2012, Seacrest signed a deal with NBCUniversal expanding his on-air role beyond E! to NBC. He contributed to the Today Show, Olympics coverage, entertainment programming, as well as news and other special events. Seacrest will remain managing editor of E! News and host and produce its red carpet awards show coverage.[30]
An Associated Press profile portrayed Seacrest as using both the deal with E! and the Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve involvement as a springboard towards a long-lasting career in television production and ownership.[31]
RSP produces the hit series Keeping Up with the Kardashians, the highest-rated show on the E! network, and the spin-offs Khloe and Lamar, Kourtney and Kim Take New York and Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami. RSP also produced the Emmy Award-winning ABC reality series Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution. RSP also produced two new reality series in 2012 including Melissa and Tye, which aired on CMT and Shahs of Sunset for Bravo. Bravo announced a second season of Shahs of Sunset on April 18, 2012.[32] RSP's new show Married to Jonas premiered on August 19, 2012 on E! and was renewed for a second season.[33][34]
On January 31, 2012, Thomas H. Lee Partners and Bain Capital announced they would invest up to $300M in Ryan Seacrest Media.[35] A consortium headed by Seacrest (with partners AEG and CAA) agreed to rebrand Mark Cuban's HDNet television network as AXS TV.[36]
In 2010, Seacrest, along with his family, launched nonprofit organization Ryan Seacrest Foundation (RSF), intended to enhance the quality of life of children considered to be in need of help. Its actions include the construction of broadcast media centers in hospitals intended to educate children about using radio, television and new media technologies, including in ways that the RSF considers to be creative. RSF has two centers at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.[37] In April 2012, Seacrest named Selena Gomez as Ambassador to the Foundation.[38]
In April 2010, Seacrest began dating Julianne Hough, a professional dancer, actress, and singer known for participating in Dancing with the Stars.[39][40] On March 15, 2013, it was announced that their relationship had ended.[41] They were dating for over two years before the split.[42]

1980sBroadcast Beginnings"When I was 10, 11, 12 years old, I would pretend to be on the radio," Seacrest tells ABC News in 2007. "I bought a mixer and these big, ugly headphones and I would literally broadcast the cassette tapes in my bedroom." Of her son's passion for announcing, Connie Seacrest tells the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, "Instead of playing with G.I. Joes or Cowboys and Indians, [Ryan] would always have a little microphone and do shows in the house." early 1990sFrom College to ESPN to L.A.At 16, Seacrest scores an internship at Atlanta radio station WSTR/Star 94, eventually landing a job filling the 7:00 PM-midnight shift. After high school, he enters the University of Georgia, where he majors in journalism. During his freshman year, he captures the attention of ESPN, which hires him to host a weekend TV sports game show called Radical Outdoor Challenge.  By the end of 1994, he quits school and moves to L.A. 1994L.A. Hosting ProdigyIn L.A., Seacrest, 20, lands a $15-an-hour job hosting KYSR-FM 98.7's afternoon show, called Ryan Seacrest for the Ride Home. It becomes the station's No. 1 show and is nationally syndicated. He also hosts TV shows Click, Gladiators 2000 and Wild Animal Games (left). Veteran TV mogul Merv Griffin, who produces the children's series Click, tells The New York Times that Seacrest's energy "just baffled me. I couldn't keep up with him...He had this spiky haircut, and we knew all the little girls in the audience would love him, and they did." 2002Becoming an IdolSeacrest cohosts FOX's new series American Idol with Brian Dunkleman (pictured with Seacrest and Kelly Clarkson). The show features aspiring singers who are judged by Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson and voted on by viewers. "On Idol, I'm the traffic cop," Seacrest tells L.A.'s Daily News. "I'm the mouthpiece." After Idol's first season, Dunkleman quits, but Seacrest doesn't miss a beat. "I think it works very well having one person drive that show," he tells PEOPLE.2003JuneToo Pretty to be Straight?Seacrest, who is named one of PEOPLE's 50 Most Beautiful, begins a two-year relationship with actress Shana Wall (left), which helps dispel speculation that the well-groomed metrosexual is gay. "What girl doesn't want a guy who loves to go shopping and get massages?" Wall asks PEOPLE. Seacrest adds, "I could lie and pretend that I hunt and camp, but that wouldn't be me. Clothes? Shopping? That's stuff I like!" In 2005, Seacrest re-triggers talk when he accepts the crown of Queen at the traditionally gay-oriented West Hollywood Halloween Carnaval.2004SpringThe Idol PhenomenonAmerican Idol becomes the most watched TV show. "This is something that I would pay to be a part of. It fuels everything else," Seacrest (pictured with Idol judges Cowell, Abdul and Jackson) tells Esquire. "It allows me the exposure and the access to the public and to the executives in our business." Successful TakeoversSeacrest assumes hosting duties for Casey Kasem's popular weekly radio show American Top 40. "There are people in this business who are as comfortable in front of the camera as they are behind it. Ryan is a real pro," Kasem tells L.A.'s Daily News. He continues his takeover pattern, replacing 22-year host Rick Dees on the daily morning-drive show for 102.7 KIIS-FM in L.A. The program is renamed On Air with Ryan Seacrest and goes from 10th to 5th place in the ratings. 2005Cohosting With Dick ClarkSeacrest cohosts Dick Clark's long-running New Year's Rockin' Eve (right), helping out the 75-year-old Clark whose speech and movement are severely limited after his 2004 stroke. "I have never seen anyone work so hard at so many different things," Clark tells Time. "You've got to have brains to make it look easy." Of his success, Simon Cowell says, "I'm going to hate reading this, but Ryan has a tremendous work ethic. He wants all the glory, but he's prepared to work for it, and I've never heard him complain." AprilRyan's StarSeacrest receives a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Justifying his hyperactive work pace to The New York Times, Seacrest says he's "frightened by the thought of being out of work. Growing up, there were people on shows like Diff'rent Strokes, Facts of Life and Love Boat that you thought would be huge stars for the rest of their lives, and they've just vanished.  You never want to be that person." 2006Welcome to E!Seacrest's three-year, $21 million contract with the E! Cable Network to develop, produce and host a variety of programs is announced. Among the changes: Seacrest begins cohosting E! News Daily with Giuliana Rancic (right). "[Seacrest] actually is a very nice person," Rancic confides to ABC News. "You want to hate him because he's pretty and he makes a lot of money, but you can't hate him."

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Born and raised in Atlanta, Seacrest has been the heart and soul of television and in radio for many years, beginning as the host of such kids shows as, Gladiators 2000 (1994), Fox Family Channel's Wild Animal Games (1995), and Click (1997), which ultimately led him to his afternoon gig at Los Angeles's Radio Station, 98.7 FM, on which he hosts and produces the #1 daily afternoon talk show, "Ryan Seacrest for The Ride Home." In the summer of 2002, he began to find fame as the host of American Idol: The Search for a Superstar (2002), a Star Search (1983) clone in which contestants try their best at auditioning a song before going on stage and to find out, who's really, the American Idol. He hosted the first two seasons of the show and after finishing the popular series, Ryan serves in the same capacity for American Juniors (2003). As in Idol, he will interact with the talent and judges, in order to keep track of viewers through the weekly show that will make it a successful hit.
      Had a very brief appearance as an extra in Crimson Tide (1995). He is shown as the submarine is getting underway, staring at an aquarium. He pointed this out himself when he was the host of NBC Saturday Night Movie (2000). Since he was an extra, he is not credited.
      In January 2004, he took over Casey Kasem's place as host of American Top 40. In December 2004, Ryan began hosting a second version of American Top 40 (Hot AC version).
      Received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Radio at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on April 13, 2005.
      Has mostly German and Swiss-German ancestry. He also has distant Irish roots. The family surname was originally spelled "Secrest".
      [on the death of Jennifer Hudson's mother, brother and nephew]: We're praying for her. I sent her an email to share my sorrow for what she went through and asked her if there was anything we could do.
      [on Dick Clark]: I saw him recently, and he was in a fantastic mood. I know he loves this show and loves being in Times Square. What's great about Dick is he doesn't need much of a plan.
      [on the departure of Paula Abdul, who was one of the judges]: So the news that Paula Abdul is leaving "American Idol" stunned me last night. She's a dear friend, I love her to death, and it's really sad that it's come to fruition. I'm just bummed and I think if you were to talk to Randy or Simon they'd say the same thing. It's just sad. It bums us out.
      [on his romance with Teri Hatcher]: I think we can assume that we've been together. If I wanted to have my picture taken I would have gone to a popular celebrity restaurant. The Ivy, [the restaurant where he was photographed with Hatcher] was far out of town. That was a surprise to me.
      If Simon does get married it would be an even bigger event than the Oscars. I'm still not convinced that there's going to be a wedding, because I have known him for so long and I'm waiting for this to be a big practical joke. I'm expecting him to put out a press release like the Jonas Brothers, saying I too have given out a commitment ring. I honestly don't think there will be a wedding.
      [Who jokingly said about Simon Cowell getting married]: I hope that if they are building a life together, there aren't too many mirrors around to distract him from his girlfriend!
      [of his on- and off-screen rivalry with Simon Cowell, who used to be one of the judges]: We are as competitive as two individuals can be, but there was a time when we both didn't have anything. There was a time when, I know, he lost all of his money, and I certainly came here with a Honda Prelude, so I didn't have anything either. So I think there's a part of us that really is driven to be successful?... However, it's kind of a fun-and-games thing, where we try and one-up one another.
      [of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt]: Yeah... but they live in France! There's an NBC deal there. NBC hosted the Globes, and they have a deal to talk to the people who come to the Globes. Here's what I realized when I went down there. I realized quickly that's against the rules to walk down onto the carpet from the platform. Then we went back down there and caught up with Tom Cruise, who I think is a terrific guy. I think he's really cool. By the way, have you seen his skin tone up close lately? You should!
      [of Rich Fields]: Rich Fields is the glue that holds "The Price is Right" together. His voice makes me feel safe. He is the unsung hero of the show.

Although comparing Ryan Seacrest to the iconic Dick Clark might be dubbed blasphemous in some circles, for those who came of age watching American Idol, Seacrest holds a similar pop-culture position as the longtime American Bandstand host. Now considered one of the hardest-working men in show business, the Georgia native began his career at age 16 as an intern at WSTR/Star 94 in Atlanta. A natural on the air, he was soon hosting the nighttime slot. He continued his radio career in Los Angeles and began adding on-camera gigs to his résumé, hosting low-profile shows like Gladiators 2000 and Click before American Idol elevated him from the ranks of unknown peppy personalities. He initially appeared opposite Brian Dunkleman on the wildly popular Fox reality competition, but by Season 2 he was the sole host, bantering back and forth with judge Simon Cowell, offering contestants a friendly shoulder to cry on, and charming viewers with his impossibly white smile and affable attitude. In 2005, Seacrest fulfilled a lifelong dream when he hosted Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve alongside the ailing legend. He also became a producer of the show and was named as Clark's eventual successor. In 2006, the multitasking media man signed on to E! Entertainment Television as an anchor, delivering news and interviewing stars on the red carpet. And before long Seacrest became a celebrity in his own right, landing more and more high-profile hosting gigs, including the 59th and 60th Primetime Emmy Awards, and lucrative endorsement deals with brands like Proctor & Gamble and Coca-Cola.Ryan Seacrest Fast Facts:
He launched The R Line in 2005, a clothing line for men and women specializing in his signature T-shirts.

I find Seacrest obnoxious. He's like a barracuda on American Idol waiting for anything to attack Simon Cowell over in the hopes of humiliating him.........last week's Idol had a moment that totally caught hhim off guard when he was met with stony silence after yet another sarcastic comment to Simon..now tthat moment was well deserved and I loved it!!About time.although Simon dishes it out as good as hhe gets sparring with Seacrest, for a TV host to pperform so unprofessionally is ridiculous.
