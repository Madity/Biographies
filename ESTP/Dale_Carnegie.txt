Dale Breckenridge Carnegie (spelled Carnagey until c. 1922) (November 24, 1888 – November 1, 1955) was an American writer and lecturer and the developer of famous courses in self-improvement, salesmanship, corporate training, public speaking, and interpersonal skills. Born into poverty on a farm in Missouri, he was the author of How to Win Friends and Influence People (1936), a massive bestseller that remains popular today. He also wrote How to Stop Worrying and Start Living (1948), Lincoln the Unknown (1932), and several other books.
One of the core ideas in his books is that it is possible to change other people's behavior by changing one's behavior toward them.
Born in 1888 in Maryville, Missouri, Carnegie was a poor farmer's boy, the second son of James William Carnagey (b. Indiana, February 15, 1852 – May 18, 1941) and wife Amanda Elizabeth Harbison (b. Missouri, February 21, 1858 – December 4, 1939). His family moved to Belton, Missouri when he was a small child. In his teens, though still having to get up at 4 a.m. every day to milk his parents' cows, he managed to obtain an education at the State Teacher's College in Warrensburg. His first job after college was selling correspondence courses to ranchers. He moved on to selling bacon, soap, and lard for Armour & Company. He was successful to the point of making his sales territory of South Omaha, Nebraska, the national leader for the firm.[1]
After saving $500 (about $12700 today), Dale Carnegie quit sales in 1911 in order to pursue a lifelong dream of becoming a Chautauqua lecturer. He ended up instead attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, but found little success as an actor, though it is written that he played the role of Dr. Hartley in a road show of Polly of the Circus.[2] When the production ended, he returned to New York, unemployed, nearly broke, and living at the YMCA on 125th Street. There he got the idea to teach public speaking, and he persuaded the "Y" manager to allow him to instruct a class in return for 80% of the net proceeds. In his first session, he had run out of material. Improvising, he suggested that students speak about "something that made them angry", and discovered that the technique made speakers unafraid to address a public audience.[3] From this 1912 début, the Dale Carnegie Course evolved. Carnegie had tapped into the average American's desire to have more self-confidence, and by 1914, he was earning $500 (about $11800 today) every week.
Perhaps one of Carnegie's most successful marketing moves was to change the spelling of his last name from "Carnagey" to Carnegie, at a time when Andrew Carnegie (unrelated) was a widely revered and recognized name. By 1916, Dale was able to rent Carnegie Hall itself for a lecture to a packed house.[4] Carnegie's first collection of his writings was Public Speaking: a Practical Course for Business Men (1926), later entitled Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business (1932). His crowning achievement, however, was when Simon & Schuster published How to Win Friends and Influence People. The book was a bestseller from its debut in 1936,[5] in its 17th printing within a few months.[4] By the time of Carnegie's death, the book had sold five million copies in 31 languages, and there had been 450,000 graduates of his Dale Carnegie Institute.[6] It has been stated in the book that he had critiqued over 150,000 speeches in his participation in the adult education movement of the time.[7]
During World War I he served in the U.S. Army.[8] His first marriage ended in divorce in 1931. On November 5, 1944, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he married Dorothy Price Vanderpool (1913-1998), who also had been divorced. Vanderpool had two daughters; Rosemary, from her first marriage, and Donna Dale from their marriage together.
Carnegie died at his home in Forest Hills, New York.[9] He was buried in the Belton, Cass County, Missouri, cemetery. The official biography from Dale Carnegie & Associates, Inc. states that he died of Hodgkin's disease, complicated with uremia, on November 1, 1955.[10]
Published in 1936, How to Win Friends and Influence People is still a popular book in business and Business Communication skills. Dale Carnegie's four part book is packed with advice to create success in business and personal lives. How to Win Friends and Influence People is a tool used in Dale Carnegie Training and includes the following parts:
The Dale Carnegie Course in Effective Speaking and Human Relations is a learn-by-doing based program for individuals based on Dale Carnegie's teachings. It was founded in 1912 and is represented in more than 90 countries. More than 8 million people have completed Dale Carnegie Training.[5]
Since its founding Dale Carnegie Training has expanded into sales training, leadership training, presentations training, and most recently customized corporate solutions.
The course comprises a proprietary process that uses team dynamics and intra-group activities to strengthen interpersonal relations, manage stress and handle fast-changing workplace conditions. Other subjects included are communication, creative problem-solving and focused leadership.
"The ideas I stand for are not mine. I borrowed them from Socrates. I swiped them from Chesterfield. I stole them from Jesus. And I put them in a book. If you don't like their rules, whose would you use?"
"I am very fond of strawberries and cream, but I have found that for some strange reason, fish prefer worms. So when I went fishing, I didn’t think about what I wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I didn't bait the hook with strawberries and cream. Rather, I dangled a worm or grasshopper in front of the fish."
"Develop success from failures. Discouragement and failure are two of the surest stepping stones to success."
"Are you bored with life? Then throw yourself into some work you believe in with all your heart, live for it, die for it, and you will find happiness that you had thought could never be yours."
"Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy."
1926: Public Speaking: a Practical Course for Business Men.[13] Later editions and updates changed the name of the book several times: Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business (1937 revised),[14] How to Develop Self-Confidence and Influence People by Public Speaking (1956) [15] and Public Speaking for Success (2005).[16]
1959: Dale Carnegie's Scrapbook: a Treasury of the Wisdom of the Ages.[23] A selection of Dale Carnegie's writings edited by Dorothy Carnegie.
1962: The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking.[24] The fourth revision of Public speaking and influencing men in business, by Dorothy Carnegie, based upon Dale Carnegie's own notes and ideas but a very different book than original.
1947: A Quick and Easy Way to Learn to Speak in Public. (later combined as Speak More Effectively, 1979)
1959: How to Save Time and Get Better Results in Conferences (later renamed Meetings: Quicker & Better Results)

          Dale Carnegie (originally Carnagey) was a pioneer in corporate training programs and the developer of famous courses in self-improvement, public speaking and interpersonal skills. His best know book, "How to Win Friends and Influence People," first published in 1936, remains popular ever since.He was born Dale Breckenridge Carnagey, on November 24, 1888, in Maryville, Missouri. His father, named John William Carnagey, was a poor farmer. His mother, named Amanda Elizabeth Carnagey (nee Harbison), worked with his father on the farm. The family was in debt, and as a young boy he had to get up at 4 A. M. every day to milk the cows and help on the farm, then to go to school. He managed to get through school and graduated from the State Teacher's College in Warrensburg, Missouri.Dale Carnagey's first job was selling correspondence learning courses to farmers. Then he worked as a salesman for Armour & Company, the largest slaughterhouse and meatpacking company in Chicago. He was selling their meats, soap, lard, and other byproducts. Armour & Company was notorious for low compensation and also for banning unionization. Carnagey was the most successful salesman in Omaha, and made his sales territory the national leader of the company.In 1911 he quit the job as a salesman in order to pursue a lifelong dream to become a lecturer with then popular adult education courses in Chautauqua, near Jamestown, New York. However, he ended up instead attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City, then he tried acting with a touring troupe, but the production where he played a role soon ended. He returned to New York, unemployed and nearly broke, and was living at the YMCA on the 125 Street. There he tried writing but without any success.In 1912 Dale Carnagey persuaded the YMCA hostel manager to allow him to teach a class on public speaking. He got himself a classroom in return for 80% of the net proceeds. Carnagey was improvising from his first session, and as he run out of material, he suggested that students speak about "something that made them angry." Carnagey noticed that the technique made his students unafraid to speak before an audience. Although the same technique was known since ancient philosophical schools, and has been widely used in group therapy, albeit Dale Carnagey developed his own approach. He quickly became a successful teacher capitalizing on the average American's desire to have more self-confidence.In 1913 Dale Carnagey published his first bestselling book: "Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business" (1913-1932 with updates and revisions). In 1914 he was earning 500 dollars a week, which at that time was the price of a new Ford Model T. In 1916 Dale Carnagey was able to rent the New York's main venue, the Carnegie Hall, and his lectures were sold out. In 1919 he changed the spelling of his name from Carnagey to Carnegie. In 1926 he published the first collection of his writings titled "Public Speaking: a practical Course for Business Men." The book became a bestseller, and the author became rich. However, he lost all his savings in the stock market crash of 1929.Dale Carnegie learned to accept the worst that can happen, then proceed to improve on the worst. His own experience was the source for his bestselling books: "Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business" and "How to Win Friends and Influence People" (1936). The latter book had 17 printings in the first year. He also wrote "Lincoln the Unknown," a biography of president Abraham Lincoln. Carnegie developed famous courses on self-improvement, salesmanship, and corporate training programs, as well, as programs for improvement in public speaking skills and interpersonal skills.Dale Carnegie died at age 66, of a Hodgkin's lymphoma, complicated with uremia, on November 1, 1955, in Forest Hills, New York. He was laid to rest in the Belton cemetery, Cass County, Missouri, USA.Over 50 million copies of Dale Carnegie's books were sold worldwide, translated in about 40 languages. In the late 1950s Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev visited America with top Soviet experts for learning and using the most efficient American business techniques in the Soviet government. Carnegie's books were then translated into Russian for exclusive use by the privileged leadership of the Soviet Communist party and the KGB. Carnegie's books were disallowed to general Russian public until 'perestroika' reforms were initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev.The Dale Carnegie Course is a popular tool for a shy person to overcome social anxiety in a tough business environment. It was completed by millions of students in 75 countries. Though the course has been criticized by some for it's somewhat manipulative techniques and self-promotional goals, it remains in demand. The Dale Carnegie course teaches that students should be sincere and genuine in their interests to their partner or to the object of their business. Carnegie was an early proponent of responsibility assumption; his core idea was that behavior of other people may be changed by changing one's reaction to them.

Dale Breckenridge Carnegie, born on 24th November, 1888- 1st November, 1955 was a highly acclaimed American writer, professor and the also the founder of courses such as salesmanship, public speaking, self-improvement and interactive skills. He was born in an impoverished family in Maryville, Missouri. Carnegie harboured a strong love and passion for public speaking from a very early age and was very proactive in debate in high school. Carnegie went to the Warrensburg State Teachers College and later onwards became a salesman for Armour and Company in Nebraska. He also moved to New York in the pursuit of a career in acting and gave classes in public speaking at the Young Men’s Christian Association. Consequently, he began to form classes of his own and also started to work on writing pamphlets, which would eventually be published as books. Carnegie was of the opinion that the quickest and most effective way to build up self-confidence and self-esteem is through public speaking and interaction. 
During the early 1930’s, he was renowned and very famous for his books and a radio program. When How to Win Friends and Influence People was published in 1930, it became an instant success and subsequently became one of the biggest bestsellers of all time. It sold more than 10 million copies in many different languages. It also increased the demand for further literary work from him and also to give lectures. Therefore, he began work as a newspaper columnist and formed the Dave Carnegie Institute for Effective Speaking and Human Relations, with several branches globally. Fortunately for Carnegie, he managed to live to see the day, when his name was associated with self-help to success that he so actively advocated and promoted. 
Carnegie loved teaching others to climb the pillars of success. His valuable and tested advice was used in many domains and has been the inspiration of many famous people’s success. His book, How To Win Friends and Influence People remains one of the most commercially famous books, primarily because of the colorful illustrations and simple well-constructed rules. The most famous and cited maxims in the book are “Believe that you will succeed, and you will,” and “Learn to love, respect and enjoy other people.”

Perhaps the most well-known author in the field of communication and public speaking, Dale Carnegie was born into poverty on a small farm in Maryville Missouri. Devoted to public speaking from his teen years, he was active in debate in high school. Carnegie attended Warrensburg (Mo.) State Teachers College, and became a salesman for Armour and Company in Nebraska. Moving to New York City in pursuit of an acting career, he gave classes in public speaking at the Young Men’s Christian Association. Soon he was developing courses on his own, and writing pamphlets that he would eventually publish as books. Carnegie believed that the quickest way to develop self-esteem is through public speaking.
In the early 1930s he was known for his books and a radio program. When he published How to Win Friends and Influence People in 1930, it enjoyed immediate success and would become one of the best-sellers of all time, selling more than 10 million copies in many languages. This led to demand for him as a lecturer and writer: he began a syndicated newspaper column and organized the Dale Carnegie Institute for Effective Speaking and Human Relations, with branches all over the world. He lived to see the day when his name became virtually synonymous with the very kind of self-help-to-success that he promoted.
Dale Carnegie loved to teach others how to become successful. His rock-solid, time-tested advice has helped many now-famous people to climb the ladder of success. How to Win Friends and Influence People remains one of the best-sellers of all time, because of its colorful illustrative stories and simple, well-phrased rules. Two of Dale Carnegie’s most famous maxims are, “Believe that you will succeed, and you will,” and “Learn to love, respect and enjoy other people.” Dale Carnegie died in 1955 at the age of 67.
