Angelina Jolie (/dʒoʊˈliː/ joh-LEE, born Angelina Jolie Voight; June 4, 1975) is an American actress, film director, screenwriter, and author. She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and was named Hollywood's highest-paid actress by Forbes in 2009,[2] 2011,[3] and 2013.[4] Jolie promotes humanitarian causes, and is noted for her work with refugees as a Special Envoy and former Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). She has been cited as the world's "most beautiful" woman by various media outlets, a title for which she has received substantial publicity.[5][6][7][8]
Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982), but her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993). Her first leading role in a major film was in the cyber-thriller Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical television films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999).
Jolie achieved wide fame after her portrayal of the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), and established herself among the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood with the sequel The Cradle of Life (2003).[9] She continued her action star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), Salt (2010) and The Tourist (2010)—her biggest live-action commercial successes to date with international revenues of US$478 million, $341 million, $293 million and $278 million respectively[10]—and she received further critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Jolie made her directorial debut with the wartime drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011).
Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, Jolie now lives with actor Brad Pitt, in a relationship notable for fervent media attention. Jolie and Pitt have three biological children and three adopted children.
Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor, and goddaughter of actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell. On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[11][12] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[11] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[13] although her only known indigenous ancestor was a Huron woman born in 1649.[11]
After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[14] As a child, Jolie often watched movies with her mother and explained this had inspired her interest in acting; she stated that she was not influenced by her father's career.[15] When she was six years old, her mother and stepfather, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[16] they returned to Los Angeles five years later. She then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.
At the age of 14, Jolie dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director.[17] She began working as a fashion model, modeling mainly in Los Angeles, New York, and London. During this period, she wore black clothing, experimented with knife play, and went out moshing with her live-in boyfriend.[15] Two years later, after the relationship had ended, she rented an apartment above a garage a few blocks from her mother's home.[14] She graduated from high school and returned to theater studies, though in recent times she has referred to this period with the observation, "I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos."[18]
Jolie suffered episodes of suicidal depression throughout her teens and early twenties.[17] She felt isolated at Beverly Hills High School among the children of some of the area's affluent families, as her mother survived on a more modest income, and she was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[15] She found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she started to self-harm;[19] later commenting, "I collected knives and always had certain things around. For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me."[20] She also began experimenting with drugs; by the age of 20, she had tried "just about every drug possible," including heroin.[21]
Jolie has had a difficult relationship with her father. Because of Voight's marital infidelity and the resulting breakup of her parents' marriage, she was estranged from her father for many years.[22] They reconciled and he appeared with her in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated.[14] In July 2002, Jolie—who had long used her middle name as a stage name to establish her own identity as an actress—filed a request to legally drop Voight as her surname, which was granted on September 12, 2002.[23] In August of that year, Voight claimed his daughter had "serious mental problems" on Access Hollywood.[22] In response, Jolie released a statement in which she indicated that she no longer wished to pursue a relationship with her father.[22] She explained that because she had adopted her son Maddox, she did not think it was healthy for her to associate with Voight.[24] In the wake of her mother's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007,[25] Jolie again reconciled with her father after a six-year estrangement.[26]
When she was seven years old, Jolie had a small part in Lookin' to Get Out (1982), a movie co-written by and starring her father, Jon Voight. She committed to acting at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that she was "too dark."[17] She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz's "Stand by My Woman" (1991); Antonello Venditti's version of Crowded House's hit "Don't Dream It's Over", "Alta Marea" (1991); The Lemonheads's "It's About Time" (1993); and Meat Loaf's "Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both "drama queens."[15]
Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the low-budget, straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as Casella "Cash" Reese, a near-human robot, designed to seduce her way into a rival manufacturer's headquarters and then self-detonate. Jolie was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year.[17] Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), Jolie starred as Kate "Acid Burn" Libby in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times wrote, "Kate (Angelina Jolie) stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top. Despite her sullen posturing, which is all this role requires, Ms. Jolie has the sweetly cherubic looks of her father, Jon Voight."[27] The movie failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.[28]
She next appeared in the 1996 comedy Love Is All There Is, a modern-day loose adaptation of Romeo and Juliet set among two rival Italian family restaurant owners in The Bronx, New York. In the road movie Mojave Moon (1996) she played a young woman who falls for Danny Aiello's middle-aged character, while he develops feelings for her mother, played by Anne Archer. That same year, Jolie also portrayed Margret "Legs" Sadovsky, one of five teenage girls who form an unlikely bond in the film Foxfire after they beat up a teacher who has sexually harassed them. She starred alongside actress Hedy Burress. The Los Angeles Times wrote about her performance, "It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst."[29]
In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, set in the Los Angeles underworld. The movie was not well received by critics; Roger Ebert noted that "Angelina Jolie [...] finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be Blossom's girlfriend, and maybe she is."[30] She then appeared in the television film True Women (1997), a historical romantic drama set in the American West and based on the book by Janice Woods Windle. That year, she also appeared as a stripper in the music video for "Anybody Seen My Baby?" by the Rolling Stones.
Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's George Wallace (1997). She portrayed Cornelia Wallace, the second wife of Alabama Governor George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise. The film was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. Jolie also received an Emmy Award nomination for her performance.
In 1998, Jolie starred in HBO's Gia, portraying supermodel Gia Carangi. The film chronicled the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance from Reel.com noted, "Angelina Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal—filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation—and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed."[31] For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award. She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.
In accordance with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting Gia, she told her then-husband Jonny Lee Miller that she would not be able to phone him: "I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'"[32] After Gia wrapped in 1997, Jolie announced that she had given up acting for good, because she felt that she had "nothing else to give."[33] She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she enrolled at New York University to study filmmaking and attend writing classes; she later described it as "just good for me to collect myself."[33] Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, she resumed her career.[17]
Jolie returned to film in the 1998 gangster movie Hell's Kitchen. Later that year, she appeared in Playing by Heart, part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, Ryan Phillippe, and Jon Stewart. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular. The San Francisco Chronicle wrote, "Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble."[34] Jolie won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.
In 1999, she starred in the comedy-drama Pushing Tin, alongside John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett. The film received a mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's character—Thornton's seductive wife—was particularly criticized. The Washington Post wrote, "Mary (Angelina Jolie) [is] a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home."[35] She then co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector (1999), an adaptation of a crime novel by Jeffery Deaver. Jolie played a police officer haunted by her cop father's suicide, who reluctantly helps Washington track down a serial killer. The movie grossed $151 million worldwide,[10] but was a critical failure. The Detroit Free Press concluded, "Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast."[36]
"Jolie is emerging as one of the great wild spirits of current movies, a loose cannon who somehow has deadly aim."
Jolie next took the supporting role of the sociopathic mental patient Lisa Rowe in Girl, Interrupted (1999), an adaptation of author Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name. While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie's final breakthrough in Hollywood.[38] She won her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Variety noted, "Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna's rehabilitation."[39]
In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, Gone In 60 Seconds, in which she played Sarah "Sway" Wayland, the ex-girlfriend of car thief Nicolas Cage. The role was small, and The Washington Post criticized that "all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth."[40] She later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after the emotionally heavy role of Lisa Rowe. It became her highest-grossing movie to that point, earning $237 million internationally.[10]
Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie's films to date had often not appealed to a wide audience, but Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider videogame, Jolie was required to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the title role of Lara Croft. She was generally praised for her physical performance, but the movie generated mostly negative reviews. Slant commented, "Angelina Jolie was born to play Lara Croft but [director] Simon West makes her journey into a game of Frogger."[41] The movie was an international success nonetheless, earning $275 million worldwide,[10] and launched her global reputation as a female action star.
Jolie then starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), a thriller based on the novel Waltz into Darkness by Cornell Woolrich. The film was a major critical failure, with The New York Times noting, "The story plunges more precipitously than Ms. Jolie's neckline."[42] In 2002, she starred in Life or Something Like It as an ambitious television reporter who is told that she will die in a week. The film was poorly received by critics, though Jolie's performance received positive reviews. CNN's Paul Clinton wrote, "Jolie is excellent in her role. Despite some of the ludicrous plot points in the middle of the film, this Academy Award-winning actress is exceedingly believable in her journey towards self-discovery and the true meaning of fulfilling life."[43]
Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003), which established her among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses.[9] The sequel was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156 million at the international box office.[10] She appeared in the music video for Korn's "Did My Time", which was used to promote the film. She next starred in Beyond Borders (2003), as a socialite who joins aid workers in Africa and Asia. The film reflected Jolie's real-life interest in promoting humanitarian relief, but it was critically and financially unsuccessful. The Los Angeles Times wrote, "Jolie, as she did in her Oscar-winning role in Girl, Interrupted, can bring electricity and believability to roles that have a reality she can understand. She can also, witness the Lara Croft films, do acknowledged cartoons. But the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her."[44]
In 2004, Jolie starred alongside Ethan Hawke in the thriller Taking Lives. She portrayed an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The movie received mixed reviews and The Hollywood Reporter concluded, "Angelina Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour."[45] She also provided the voice of the angelfish Lola in the DreamWorks animated movie Shark Tale (2004), and had a brief appearance in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004), a science fiction adventure film shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen. That same year, Jolie played Olympias in Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great. The film failed domestically, which director Oliver Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality,[46] but it succeeded internationally, with revenue of $139 million outside the United States.[10]
Jolie then starred opposite Brad Pitt in the 2005 action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, which tells the story of a bored married couple, John and Jane Smith, who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads. The Star Tribune noted, "While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry."[47] The movie earned $478 million worldwide, making it the seventh-highest grossing film of 2005.[48]
Jolie next appeared in Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd (2006), a film about the early history of the CIA, as seen through the eyes of Edward Wilson, an officer based on James Jesus Angleton and played by Matt Damon. Jolie played the supporting role of Margaret "Clover" Russell, Wilson's neglected wife. According to the Chicago Tribune, "Jolie ages convincingly throughout, and is blithely unconcerned with how her brittle character is coming off in terms of audience sympathy."[49]
In 2007, Jolie made her directorial debut with the documentary A Place in Time, which captures daily life in 27 locations around the world during a single week. The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival and was intended for distribution to high schools through the National Education Association.[50] Jolie then starred as Mariane Pearl in the documentary-style drama A Mighty Heart (2007). Based on Pearl's memoir of the same name, the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband, The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, in Pakistan. The Hollywood Reporter described Jolie's performance as "well-measured and moving," played "with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent."[51] Jolie was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance. She also played Grendel's mother in the animated epic Beowulf (2007), which was created through the motion capture technique.
Jolie co-starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the 2008 action movie Wanted, an adaptation of Mark Millar's graphic novel of the same name. The film received predominately favorable reviews and proved an international success, earning $342 million worldwide.[10] She also provided the voice of Master Tigress in the DreamWorks animated movie Kung Fu Panda (2008). With revenue of $632 million internationally, it became the third-highest grossing film of 2008.[52] That same year, Jolie took on the lead role in Clint Eastwood's drama Changeling.[53] Based in part on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, the film stars Jolie as Christine Collins, who is reunited with her kidnapped son in 1928 Los Angeles—only to realize the boy is an impostor. The Chicago Tribune noted, "Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm, the scenes [...] when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril."[54] Jolie received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a BAFTA Award.
Jolie next starred in the 2010 thriller Salt, her first film in two years. She starred alongside Liev Schreiber as CIA agent Evelyn Salt, who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent. Originally written as a male character, Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role to director Phillip Noyce. The film was an international success with revenues of $294 million.[10] It received mixed to positive reviews, with Jolie's performance earning praise; Empire remarked, "When it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business."[55]
She also starred opposite Johnny Depp in The Tourist (2010), which received mostly negative critical reviews. Peter Travers wrote, "Depp and Jolie hit career lows, producing the chemistry of high-fashion zombies."[56] Roger Ebert defended Jolie, stating she "does her darndest" and "plays her femme fatale with flat-out, drop-dead sexuality."[57] Despite the criticisms, after a domestic box office gross of over $67 million,[58] the film went on to gross a respectable $278 million worldwide.[10] Jolie received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance, which gave rise to speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony.[59][60] She won the 2011 Teen Choice Awards for movie actress in an action film. Jolie next reprised her voice role as Master Tigress in the animated DreamWorks sequel Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011). It became the fourth-highest grossing film of 2011,[61] and her highest-grossing film to date, earning $666 million at the international box office.[10]
In 2011, Jolie made her directorial feature debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey, a love story between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner of war, set during the 1992–95 Bosnian War. She wrote the script after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, with the aim of rekindling attention for the survivors of a war that took place in recent history.[62] To ensure a sense of authenticity, she cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia, most of whom lived through the war—including stars Goran Kostić and Zana Marjanović—and incorporated their experiences into her script. The resulting film, which she also co-produced, was released in U.S. theaters entirely in the Serbo-Croatian-Bosnian language.[63]
In the Land of Blood and Honey received mixed reviews from critics. Kenneth Turan of The Los Angeles Times criticized its "contrived plot points," but ultimately acknowledged that, as a first-time director, "Jolie accomplishes much in such a difficult area as the Bosnian war."[64] Writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis likewise criticized Jolie's script, noting the story's "somewhat awkward instructional, at times almost proselytizing aspect," but opined that, for the most part, the film "moves briskly and easily holds your attention."[65] The film won the Stanley Kramer Award from the Producers Guild of America, which honors films that highlight provocative social issues,[66] and received a nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It aroused both praise and criticism in the Balkans; the response from Bosniak war-victims advocacy organizations was "overwhelmingly positive,"[67] while a Serb war prisoners group decried the film for its alleged anti-Serb bias.[68] Sarajevo's regional government named Jolie an honorary citizen of the capital for raising awareness of the war.[69]
After a three and a half year absence from the screen, Jolie starred in the film Maleficent (2014). She played the titular role, Maleficent, the main antagonist from Disney's 1959 animated feature Sleeping Beauty. The film showed the original story from Maleficent's perspective, revealing the character's background.[70] The film received mixed reviews but Jolie's performance has been repeatedly singled out for praise.[71] The $70 million opening weekend in North America was the 3rd highest domestic opening weekend ever for a solo female star, behind only the first two Hunger Games films.[72] Dave Hollis, Walt Disney Studios' executive vice president of theatrical distribution credited Jolie with being a large part of the film's success, saying "Angelina Jolie is a very big part of the overall equation. As a star, she's a draw that transcends culture and borders and language. There's a universal nature to the intrigue she creates."[73]
She's set to direct a film about World War II hero Lou Zamperini, a former Olympic track star who survived a plane crash over sea and spent two years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. The Joel and Ethan Coen rewrote the script, based on Laura Hillenbrand's biography Unbroken.[74]
"We cannot close ourselves off to information and ignore the fact that millions of people are out there suffering. I honestly want to help. I don't believe I feel differently from other people. I think we all want justice and equality, a chance for a life with meaning. All of us would like to believe that if we were in a bad situation someone would help us."
Jolie first personally encountered the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world.[76] Upon her return home, she contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots.[75] To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.[75]
In the following months, she returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, where she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal,[77][78] the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual.[79] She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits.[75] Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001.[80]
Over the next decade, she went on field missions around the world and met with refugees and internally displaced persons in more than 30 countries.[81] In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, "Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon."[77] To that end, her 2001-02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her film Beyond Borders. She aimed to visit what she termed "forgotten emergencies," crises that media attention had shifted away from,[82] and she became noted for going "where real bullets fly,"[83] traveling to such war zones as Sudan's Darfur region during the Darfur conflict,[84] the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War,[85] where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces,[86] and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit.[83]
On April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner António Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization.[87] In her expanded role, she represents UNHCR and Guterres at the diplomatic level to facilitate lasting solutions for people displaced by major crises.[87] In the months following the promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoy—her third over all—to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees,[88] and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.[89]
In an effort to connect her Cambodian-born son with his heritage, Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003. The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province of Battambang, adjacent to a national park infiltrated with poachers who threatened the dwindling populations of Asian black bears, Asian elephants, and Indochinese tigers. She purchased the surrounding 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project.[90] In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.[91]
In 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Project (MJP)—to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals.[92] She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos,[90] where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in Western Kenya. By 2007, some 6000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.[90]
In addition to the facilities at MJP, Jolie has built at least ten other schools in Cambodia,[93] and funds the Maddox Chivan Children's Center, a care facility for children affected by HIV, in the capital Phnom Penh.[92] In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her daughter, she funds the Zahara Children's Center, which treats children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee.[94] She has also built schools elsewhere in the world, including a school and a boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in north-western Kenya,[95][96] a school for girls in Tangi, Afghanistan,[97] and another girls-only school in the Afghan capital Kabul.[98] These facilities and other projects are funded through the Jolie–Pitt Foundation, which Jolie and her partner Brad Pitt established in September 2006.[99]
Jolie became more involved in promoting humanitarian causes on a political level from 2003 onwards. She began lobbying humanitarian interests in the U.S. capital, where she had met with senators and representatives of Congress at least 20 times by 2006. She has been involved in child and women protection efforts, pushing for legislation to aid child refugees and other vulnerable children in both developing nations and the U.S.,[80] and fronting an international campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones.[100] She explained in 2006, "As much as I would love to never have to visit Washington, that's the way to move the ball."[80]
Since its founding at the 2007 Clinton Global Initiative, Jolie has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which funds education programs for children affected by disaster.[101] In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups.[101] The partnership has worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations' Center for Universal Education—founded by the partnership's co-chair, noted economist Gene Sperling—to establish education policies, which resulted in recommendations made to UN agencies, G8 development agencies, and the World Bank.[102] Jolie joined the Council on Foreign Relations in June 2007.[103]
Jolie also co-chairs Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), which provides free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S. She founded KIND in October 2008, in a collaboration with the Microsoft Corporation and 25 leading U.S. law firms.[104] She had previously, from 2005 to 2007, funded a similar initiative, the then-newly launched National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children.[105][106] In the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, she established the Jolie Legal Fellowship, whose member attorneys—the first of whom was appointed in January 2011[107]—assist and support government officials and other organizations in their efforts to secure the legal protection of Haiti's most vulnerable children.[107]
In May 2012, Jolie joined UK Foreign Secretary William Hague in a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones, the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative.[100] To highlight the problem, Jolie and Hague subsequently travelled to eastern DR Congo, where rape has been frequently used as a weapon of war by rebel groups and soldiers.[100] In 2013, she spoke at a G8 foreign ministers meeting, where ministers pledged $36 million in funding to go toward developing international standards for the investigation and prosecution of war rape,[108] and before the UN security council—the UN's most powerful body—which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date.[109]
Jolie has received wide recognition for her humanitarian work. In 2002, she received the inaugural Humanitarian Award from the Church World Service's Immigration and Refugee Program,[110] and in 2003, she was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association. She was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the UNA-USA in 2005,[111] and she received the Freedom Award by the International Rescue Committee in 2007.[112] In 2011, UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres presented Jolie with a gold pin reserved for the most long-serving staff, in recognition of her decade as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[113] In November 2013, she received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, an honorary Academy Award, from the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[114][115]
Jolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14. Her mother allowed them to live together in her home, of which Jolie later said, "I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way."[116] She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.[117]
During filming of Hackers (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the relationship in her early teens.[17] They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after on March 28, 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name in her blood.[118] Jolie and Miller separated in September 1997 and divorced on February 3, 1999. They remained on good terms, and Jolie later explained, "It comes down to timing. I think he's the greatest husband a girl could ask for. I'll always love him, we were simply too young."[119]
Jolie had a brief relationship with model-actress Jenny Shimizu on the set of Foxfire (1996). She later said, "I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her."[120] Shimizu claimed in 2005 that her relationship with Jolie had lasted many years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people.[121] In 2003, asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, "Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it's okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!"[122]
After a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They met on the set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern.[123] As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media.[124] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a son from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later. Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. Asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, "It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet."[125]
In early 2005, Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of being the reason for the divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She and Pitt were alleged to have started an affair during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005). She denied this on several occasions, but later admitted that they "fell in love" on the set.[126] She explained in 2005, "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife."[122] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when Jolie confirmed to People that she was pregnant with Pitt's child.[127] Pitt and Jolie announced their engagement in April 2012, after seven years together.[128] As a couple, they are dubbed "Brangelina" by the entertainment media, and are the subject of worldwide media coverage.[129]
On March 10, 2002, Jolie adopted her first child, seven-month-old Maddox Chivan, from an orphanage in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.[130] He was born as Rath Vibol on August 5, 2001, in a local village.[131] Jolie applied for adoption after she had visited Cambodia twice, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission. The adoption process was halted in December 2001 when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking.[132] Once the adoption was finalized, she took custody of Maddox in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003).[132] Although Jolie and her then-husband Billy Bob Thornton announced the adoption together, she in fact adopted Maddox as a single parent.[133][134]
Jolie adopted a daughter, six-month-old Zahara Marley, from an orphanage in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 6, 2005. Zahara was born as Yemsrach on January 8, 2005, in Awasa.[135] At the time of the adoption, Zahara was wrongly believed to be an AIDS orphan and it was unknown whether she herself had contracted HIV, but she later tested negative.[136] Shortly after they returned to the United States, Zahara was hospitalized for dehydration and malnutrition.[136] In November 2007, media outlets reported that Zahara's biological mother wanted her daughter back, but she denied these reports, saying she thought Zahara was "very fortunate" to have been adopted by Jolie.[135]
Jolie was accompanied by her partner Brad Pitt when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara.[137] She later indicated that she and Pitt had made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia together.[138] In December 2005, Pitt's publicist announced that Pitt was seeking to adopt Maddox and Zahara.[139] To reflect this, Jolie filed a request to legally change her children's surnames from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was granted on January 19, 2006.[140] The adoptions were finalized soon after.[141]
In an attempt to avoid the media frenzy surrounding their relationship, Jolie and Pitt went to Namibia for the birth of their first biological child. On May 27, 2006, Jolie gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in Swakopmund. Pitt confirmed that their newborn daughter would have a Namibian passport.[142] The couple decided to sell the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images themselves, rather than allowing paparazzi to make these valuable photographs. People paid a reported $4.1 million for the North American rights, while Hello! obtained the British rights for a reported $3.5 million.[143] All profits were donated to charities serving African children.[143]
On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a son, three-year-old Pax Thien, from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam.[144] He was born as Pham Quang Sang on November 29, 2003, in HCMC, where he was abandoned soon after birth.[145] Jolie adopted Pax as a single parent, because Vietnam's adoption regulations do not allow unmarried couples to co-adopt.[144] The rights for the first post-adoption images of Pax were sold to People for a reported $2 million, as well as to Hello! for an undisclosed amount.[146] In April, Jolie filed a request to legally change her son's surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was approved on May 31, 2007.[147] Pitt's adoption of Pax was finalized in the United States on February 21, 2008.[148]
At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, France, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade.[149] She gave birth to a son, Knox Léon, and a daughter, Vivienne Marcheline, on July 12, 2008.[150] The rights for the first images of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello! for a reported $14 million—the most expensive celebrity pictures ever taken. The proceeds were donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.[150]
On February 16, 2013, at the age of 37, Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene.[151] Her family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer in 2007 at the age of 56, while her maternal grandmother had ovarian cancer and died aged 45.[11][152] Her maternal aunt Debbie Martin, who had the same defective BRCA1 gene as Jolie, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004 and died at age 61 on May 26, 2013.[153][154] Jolie's mastectomy lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, and testing of the removed breast tissue showed no signs of cancerous cells.[155] On April 27, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts (transplants).[152] She reportedly intends to undergo a preventive oophorectomy (ovariectomy), as she still has a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly.[156]
"I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they have strong options."
Jolie kept news of her mastectomy private until she had completed the three-month process. On May 14, The New York Times published an op-ed titled "My Medical Choice" in which Jolie wrote about her decision and procedures, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices.[151] To that end, her treatment regimen was posted on the website of the Pink Lotus Breast Center, where she was treated.[152] In her piece—published concurrently with U.S. Supreme Court deliberations on BRCA gene patent rights held by Myriad Genetics[157]—Jolie acknowledged the largely prohibitive cost of BRCA gene testing and advocated wider accessibility.[158] On June 13, 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that isolated genes are not patentable, invalidating the BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics.[159][160]
Jolie's announcement drew extensive public attention; a Time cover story titled "The Angelina Effect" observed that Jolie brought "genetic testing in the spotlight," and noted her ability to influence people on a large scale.[161] Various public figures applauded Jolie for her decision;[162] UK foreign secretary William Hague, who visited refugee camps in Congo-Kinshasa with Jolie in March, called her "an inspiration to many."[163] Most medical experts who weighed in publicly agreed that Jolie made the right choice for herself,[164] but differed in their response to its expected influence on the public. Her decision was met with praise from health campaigners, who welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to those at risk,[163] while other experts feared a widespread overestimation of BRCA mutation occurrence,[161] as less than 1% of all women carry this genetic condition,[165] and a misunderstanding of the risks involved for those who do test positive.[161] Eric Topol, a geneticist and director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute in California, told attendees at a genetics symposium "This is the moment that will propel genomic medicine forward", saying that Jolie's announcement was "incredibly important symbolically".[166]
During the first decade of her career, Jolie—who does not employ a publicist or an agent[167]—maintained a "wild child" persona in her communication with the media. She openly discussed her love life, including her bisexuality and her interest in BDSM.[19] After she kissed her brother during the Academy Awards in 2000, their close relationship became the subject of tabloid media speculation, which she dismissed.[168] She spoke about her experiences with drugs and depression, and recalled the time, in 1997, when she almost hired a hitman to kill her, as well as the three days, just before her marriage to Billy Bob Thornton, that she was sectioned at UCLA's psychiatric ward.[17] By the mid-2000s, Jolie's involvement with the UNHCR and the adoption of her son Maddox had transformed her public image from Hollywood eccentric into humanitarian and devoted mother.[131][167]
Jolie has attracted notable media attention for her physical appearance—particularly her full lips and her many tattoos, being her most distinctive features. She has been named the world's "most beautiful" or "sexiest" woman by various media outlets, including Vogue in 2002,[5] Esquire in 2004,[169] American FHM and British Harper's Bazaar in 2005,[6][170] People and Hello! in 2006,[7][171] Empire in 2007,[172] Vanity Fair and Who in 2009,[8][173] and Allure in 2011.[174] Vanity Fair stated that 58 percent of their voters named Jolie "Most Beautiful Woman in the World," and that the competition including other celebrity women "wasn't even close."[8] Who reported that "[o]ut of all international stars, Angelina Jolie was overwhelmingly voted the world's most beautiful female."[173] Allure stated, "Angelina Jolie was named the most beautiful face around. On the surface, it's not a surprising choice: Jolie is a obviously gorgeous. But what does it say about how our views of beauty have changed?" The magazine credited society with having "branched out beyond the Barbie-doll ideal and embraced something quite different."[174] People named Jolie one of 2012's Most Beautiful at Every Age.[175]
Jolie's extensive collection of tattoos has often been addressed by interviewers. She has fourteen known tattoos, among which the Latin proverb "quod me nutrit me destruit" (what nourishes me destroys me), the Tennessee Williams quote "A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages," two sak yant designs featuring a prayer of protection and a twelve-inch-by-eight-inch tiger, and seven sets of geographical coordinates indicating the birthplaces of her children and her partner Brad Pitt.[176][177] Over time, she has covered or lasered several of her tattoos, including the name of her second husband, "Billy Bob", and the Chinese characters "死" (death) and "勇" (courage).[176]
Jolie's recognizability, influence and wealth are extensively documented. According to the Q Score, in 2000, subsequent to her Oscar win, 31% of respondents in the United States said Jolie was familiar to them; by 2006, she was familiar to 81% of Americans.[80] In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Jolie, together with partner Brad Pitt, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide.[178] She was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 2006 to 2008, and in 2011 had an endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton reportedly worth $10 million—a record for a single advertising campaign.[179] She was among the Time 100, a list of the most influential people in the world as assembled by Time, in 2006 and 2008.[180][181] Forbes named her Hollywood's highest-paid actress in 2009, 2011, and 2013, with estimated annual earnings of $27 million,[2] $30 million,[3] and $33 million respectively,[4] and she topped the magazine's Celebrity 100, a ranking of the world's most powerful celebrities, in 2009.[182]
On July 23, 2009, serving as a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie made a third trip to the Iraq War, visiting the U.S. troops stationed in 'Camp Liberty' in Baghdad's International Zone. During an interview there, she mentioned having also visited Washington, D.C.'s Walter Reed Army Medical Center: "...I was INSPIRED and reminded of all the bravery of... of all you young and, men and WOMEN...I'm always just HONOURED to spend time with, with everybody who spends time in the military...I was allowed to come and I'm privileged to be here."[183]
An unauthorized biography on Jolie by Andrew Morton was published in 2010.[184] Janet Maslin highlights the lack of sources noted in the book in a review in The New York Times, saying "the people most eager to tell him about Ms. Jolie are people who don’t know her, so that the book is shrink-wrapped in glib insights from dubious psychiatric talents".[185] Allen Barra describes it as "the worst book in the 21st century so far" in a Salon review which summarizes the book as "ill-informed, moralistic and just plain mean".[186]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Angelina Jolie is an Oscar-winning actress who has become popular by taking on the title role in the "Lara Croft" series of blockbuster movies. Off-screen, Jolie has become prominently involved in international charity projects, especially those involving refugees. She often appears on many "most beautiful women" lists, and she has a personal life that is avidly covered by the tabloid press. In her earliest years, Angelina began absorbing the acting craft from her parents - her father is the Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight and her mother is Marcheline Bertrand, who had studied with Lee Strasberg. At age 11, Angelina began studying at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she was seen in several stage productions. She undertook some film studies at New York University and later joined the renowned Met Theatre Group in Los Angeles. At age 16, she took up a career in modeling and appeared in some music videos. Her good looks may derive from her ancestry, which is German and Slovak on her father's side, and French-Canadian, Dutch, German, Czech, and remote Huron, on her mother's side.In the mid-1990s, Jolie appeared in various small films where she got good notices, including Hackers (1995) and Foxfire (1996). Her critical acclaim increased when she played strong roles in the made-for-TV movies True Women (1997), and in George Wallace (1997) which won her a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy nomination. Jolie's acclaim increased even further when she played the lead role in the HBO production Gia (1998). This was the true life story of supermodel Gia Carangi, a sensitive wild child who was both brazen and needy and who had a difficult time handling professional success and the deaths of people who were close to her. Carangi became involved with drugs and because of her needle-using habits she became, at the tender age of 26, one of the first celebrities to die of AIDS. Jolie's performance in Gia (1998) again garnered a Golden Globe Award and another Emmy nomination, and she additionally earned a SAG Award.Angelina got a major break in 1999 when she won a leading role in the successful feature The Bone Collector (1999), starring alongside Denzel Washington. In that same year, Jolie gave a tour de force performance in Girl, Interrupted (1999) playing opposite Winona Ryder. The movie was a true story of women who spent time in a psychiatric hospital. Jolie's role was reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's character in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), the role which won Nicholson his first Oscar. Unlike "Cuckoo", "Girl" was a small film that received mixed reviews and barely made money at the box office. But when it came time to give out awards, Jolie won the triple crown -- "Girl" propelled her to win the Golden Globe Award, the SAG Award and the Academy Award for best leading actress in a supporting role.With her new-found prominence, Jolie began to get in-depth attention from the press. Numerous aspects of her controversial personal life became news. At her wedding to her Hackers (1995) co-star Jonny Lee Miller, she had displayed her husband's name on the back of her shirt painted in her own blood. Jolie and Miller divorced, and in 2000, she married her Pushing Tin (1999) co-star Billy Bob Thornton. Jolie had become the fifth wife of a man twenty years her senior. During her marriage to Thornton, the spouses each wore a vial of the other's blood around their necks. That marriage came apart in 2002 and ended in divorce. In addition, Jolie was estranged from her famous father, Jon Voight.In 2000, Jolie was asked to star in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001). At first, she expressed disinterest, but then decided that the required training for the athletic role was intriguing. The Croft character was drawn from a popular video game. Lara Croft was a female cross between Indiana Jones and James Bond. When the film was released, critics were unimpressed with the final product, but critical acclaim wasn't the point of the movie. The public paid $275 million for theater tickets to see a buffed up Jolie portray the adventuresome Lara Croft. Jolie's father Jon Voight appeared in "Croft", and during filming there was a brief rapprochement between father and daughter.One of the Croft movie's filming locations was Cambodia. While there, Jolie witnessed the natural beauty, culture and poverty of that country. She considered this an eye opening experience, and so began the humanitarian chapter of her life. Jolie began visiting refugee camps around the world and came to be formally appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Some of her experiences were written and published in her popular book "Notes from My Travels" whose profits go to UNHCR.Jolie has stated that she now plans to spend most of her time in humanitarian efforts, to be financed by her actress salary. She devotes one third of her income to savings, one third to living expenses and one third to charity. In 2002, Angelina adopted a Cambodian refugee boy named Maddox, and in 2005, adopted an Ethiopian refugee girl named Zahara. Jolie's dramatic feature film Beyond Borders (2003) parallels some of her real life humanitarian experiences although, despite the inclusion of a romance between two westerners, many of the movie's images were too depressingly realistic -- the film was not popular among critics or at the box office.In 2004, Jolie began filming Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) with co-star Brad Pitt. The film became a major box office success. There were rumors that Pitt and Jolie had an affair while filming "Smith". Jolie insisted that because her mother had been hurt by adultery, she herself could never participate in an affair with a married man, therefore there had been no affair with Pitt at that time. Nonetheless, Pitt separated from his wife Jennifer Aniston in January 2005 and, in the months that followed, he was frequently seen in public with Jolie, apparently as a couple. Pitt's divorce was finalized later in 2005.Jolie and Pitt announced in early 2006 that they would have a child together, and Jolie gave birth to daughter Shiloh that May. They also adopted a three-year-old Vietnamese boy named Pax. The couple continues to pursue movie and humanitarian projects.

      Has the letter "H" tattooed on the inside of her left wrist, which is a reference to two people she is close to who have this letter in their names: her brother, James Haven, and Timothy Hutton.

      Jolie wrote an Op/Ed newspaper article titled "My Medical Choice" that was published on May 14, 2013, in The New York Times in which she revealed that she had undergone a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction because she is a carrier of a "faulty" gene, BRCA1. Her doctors advised her that that gene, along with her family history of breast cancer (including her mother's death at age 56) made it much more likely that she would have developed breast cancer (the medical estimate was that she had an 87% risk of breast cancer), so she elected to have the surgery as a preventative measure.

      Was the 116th actress to receive an Academy Award; she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Girl, Interrupted (1999) at The 72nd Annual Academy Awards (2000) on March 26, 2000.
      Because I am a bad girl, people always automatically think that I am a bad girl. Or that I carry a dark secret with me or that I'm obsessed with death. The truth is that I am probably the least morbid person one can meet. If I think more about death than some other people, it is probably because I love life more than they do.
      [on if she ever caught her husband Billy Bob Thornton cheating] I've told Billy if I ever caught him cheating, I wouldn't kill him because I love his children and they need a dad. But I would beat him up. I know where all of his sports injuries are. And I'd beat her, too!
      I'll make it real simple, I'm a 36-C. In the game, she's a double-D. In the movie [Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)], she's a D. We split the difference... [Lara] is much more athletic, and she has smaller breasts, but she's still Lara Croft, so there.
      I seem to be getting a lot of things pushed my way that are strong women. It's like people see Hackers (1995) and they send me offers to play tough women with guns, the kind who wear no bra and a little tank top. I'd like to play strong women who are also very feminine.
      I'd like to believe that the people that have supported me in my work or identified with me in films, the people that feel they know me, they do and they don't have misconceptions - they understand. I believe that.
      [on her split from husband Billy Bob Thornton] I'm angry. I'm sad. It's a very difficult and sad time. It was a real deep connection, a deep marriage, so it's not that simple to say this or that one thing caused the problems. It's clear to me that our priorities shifted overnight. He's focused on his music and career. I'm focused on my baby. It comes down to what's important to you.
      [People magazine - July 8, 1996] There's something about death that is comforting. The thought that you could die tomorrow frees you to appreciate life now.
      [on playing Olympias in Alexander (2004)] I felt that if I lived at that time, with the dangers she had and the threats she had and the lack of power she had as a woman, I would not have been that different from her. And I thought I also just saw her as a mother who really would push her son at a time that if he didn't get the throne, he didn't acquire a certain kind of strength and ability and greatness, he would probably just die or be killed or be exiled. So out of concern, out of love for your own, just to come from this place that seems very much like the horrible mafia father, but in fact it was for his own survival that she was focused on, which made it very easy for me to focus on thinking of my own son and what he had to do to protect himself from bad things that could hurt him.
      If you don't get out of the box you've been raised in, you won't understand how much bigger the world is.
      [on the superficiality of the industry] We are setting an example of what we think is beautiful and you really want to put that much make up on me?
      You might never find out that you are useful for all the right reasons - and not all those stupid things that people tell you you're useful for.
      [CNN International Edition - January 29, 2005] My role as goodwill ambassador has made my work as a film star relatively dull. I can't find anything that interests me enough to go back to work. I'm simply not excited about anything. I'm not excited about going to a film set.
      [on what she does with the money she makes each year] Save one-third, live on one-third and give away one-third.
      If I think more about death than some other people, it is probably because I love life more than they do.
      Love one person, take care of them until you die. You know, raise kids. Have a good life. Be a good friend. And try to be completely who you are. And figure out what you personally love. And like go after it with everything you've got no matter how much it takes.
      [Regarding the possibility of marriage with her current beau and father of her child, Brad Pitt] We have both been married before so it's not marriage that necessarily kept some people together.
      [2002] I'm drawn to kids that are already born. I think some people are meant to do certain things, and I believe I'm meant to find my children in the world somewhere and not necessarily have them genetically.
      [interview with Ann Curry] I'm in a strange, I suppose, place in my life. I think that happens when you lose a parent, where you drop into a different kind of serious. And yet, at the same time, you want to laugh and enjoy as much as possible every day. I'm hanging on to my family really tight at this moment, and, because of that, trying to be as good a woman as I can be in my life. Dammit, you got me crying.
      It's alright. It's a part of life... I lost my mom. It's a natural thing for a child to lose a parent. I lost my mom too young, but it happened. And I'm happy she's out of pain, because I love her and she's my friend.
      Not many people know this about me but I'm a natural blonde. My hair went from light blonde naturally to a darker kind of blonde. My mother dyed my hair dark when I was a child as I loved the look then. So I'm basically a natural blonde.
      [on making action movies] I think there's always going to be that side of me. [Harrison Ford] is doing it, and he's doing it well, (so) it looks like I've got some more time.
      To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning, if I did that.
      My natural color is dark blonde. But when I was four or five, my mother dyed my hair dark brown, and she decided to keep it that way. And I stuck with that.
      [on Cambodia and her humanitarian work] One of the first camps I went to had 400,000 people. It was a sea of human misery. In Sierra Leone, I saw tens of thousands with their arms and legs cut off [by rebels], orphaned children. I felt completely overwhelmed. I cried constantly. I felt guilty for everything that I had. Then I realized I wasn't doing these people any favors by crying. I kept getting angry at the injustices until I couldn't think straight. I took a deep breath and focused on how I could help. I discovered that I was useful as a person. When I met suffering people, it put my life into perspective. It slammed me into a bigger picture of the world.
      I was actually quite a cool kid. I was not tough. I was certainly independent and bold. I was never teased. I never had any trouble from anybody... I was never satisfied. I had trouble sleeping. I didn't really fit. I always feel that I'm searching for something deeper, something more... You want to meet other people that challenge you with ideas or with power or with passion. I wanted to live very fully. I wanted to live many lives and explore many things.
      [on Brad Pitt] (He made me) a better person. I've learned so much from him, as you do when you come together with another person. You both make each other better. You both learn about the best of each other, and recognize the things where you're failing, or where you need to step up. When it's a great partnership, you really are patient with each other.
      I grew up in front of everybody, really. The big years of exploration. There was a certain madness I was going through. I learned a lot about myself. People tend to sum up times in your life and simplify.I would say there's a way of being bold when you're young that seems very brave... What's perceived as tough is a very funny thing. I think to be a parent is one of the scariest, boldest things to do, as opposed to, um, getting a tattoo... Much more than jumping into a pool when you're 20.
      There's certainly a side of me that isn't completely... sane. Or completely 'even' all the time. We all have our dark sides.
      When I first read the script for Changeling (2008), I couldn't put it down but then I said 'no' immediately. I didn't want to go into this project because it was too upsetting. But then afterwards I couldn't stop talking about her. I found myself sitting with people wanting them to know about this extraordinary woman and you wouldn't believe what happened to her, and what these people did to her in this time in our history. In the end, it became a story about democracy in action, about justice... even suffering a great loss and fighting through it and making a change for the future for other people, and questioning the government and the police. So, I found it very inspiring and really wanted people to know about her and felt like it was an extra piece of justice for her.
      [on her friendship with Gwen Stefani and their children spending time together] All of the kids are very close in age. They've attended each other's birthday parties and gotten together several times at each other's homes. Somehow Gwen and I keep ending up pregnant at the exact same time.
      It was nice for me to play with other girls; I don't really have girlfriends in movies, if you've noticed. Well, I have a few girlfriends, I just... I stay at home a lot. I'm just not very social. I don't do a lot with them, and I'm very homebound. I'll talk to my family, I talk to Brad... But I don't know, I don't have a lot of friends I talk to. He is really the only person I talk to.
      [2012] I think I'm going to have to give up the acting as the kids hit the teenage years, anyway, too much to manage at home. I have enjoyed being an actress. I am so grateful to the job and I have had great experiences and I have even be able to tell stories and be a part of stories that mattered and I have done things for fun, but... I will do some films and I am so fortunate to have the job, it's a really lucky profession to be a part of and I enjoy it. But if it went away tomorrow I would be very happy to be home with the children. I wake up in the morning as a mum and I turn on the news like everybody else and I see what's happening and I want to be part of the world in a positive way.
      The strong preying upon the weak and the weak, upon achieving strength, extracting retribution: this is the nature of so many of the world's conflicts. The role of aggressor and victim may alternate over time, the tools of destruction may become more sophisticated, but little else changes.
      [on her double mastectomy, 2013] I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.
      [on accepting the title role in Maleficent (2014)] The artist in me felt that it was time to do something I wasn't comfortable with. I was actually a bit nervous to take her on. I don't have a big theatre voice. I don't do things that are kind of comedic, and I'm a fairy. But it's great to jump into things you're not sure of.
      [on the unplanned casting of her five-year-old daughter Vivienne as the young Princess Aurora] The first day was the scene where the princess had to catch the butterfly. So I was actually holding the ball [with the butterfly] on the end! bouncing up and down and dancing, trying to make her laugh. And Daddy was on the edge of the digital cliff she had to jump off, making faces while her brothers and sisters were egging her on. I was actually shocked that she was doing so well.
      We never wanted our kids to be actors. But we also wanted them to be around film and part of Mommy and Daddy's life and not be kept from it either. If and when they decide to be actors when they are older, I would ask that acting not be the center of their lives, because I don't think it is healthy.

=======================================================
The daughter of an Oscar-winner, she was destined for stardom. Despite acclaim for her acting, it's her bizarre private life that keeps her in the headlines. Vial of blood anyone?
Angelina Jolie Voight was born in Los Angeles, California. Her father Jon Voight was an established Hollywood actor, who had earned worldwide fame for his performances in 'Midnight Cowboy', 'Deliverance' and 'Coming Home' - the latter winning him an Oscar.Angelina's mother was the part-Iroquois, part-French actress and model Marcheline Bertrand, who, incidentally, worked as Angelina's manager. Angelina's parents split up before she was two-years-old, and her mother moved back to the East Coast with Angelina and her brother James, where they lived in the Palisades, in the state of New York.Despite her parents' divorce, Angelina remembers her childhood as being a happy one. She was a huge Star Trek fan, and showed her unusual tastes even at an early age by having a crush on Mr Spock! Her taste in pets was highly original too, and she collected snakes and lizards. Her favourite snake was called Harry Dean Stanton, and her favourite lizard was called Vladimir.At school, she joined a gang called the Kissy Girls who hunted boys down and kissed them until they begged for mercy - until the school called a halt and the gang broke up! Money was tight while Angelina was growing up, but Marcheline made a point of taking her children to the movies as often as possible. Angelina claims that these family movie outings were what first inspired her to dream of becoming an actress.When Angelina was 11, the family moved back to Los Angeles. Angelina decided to get serious about her dream of becoming an actress and enrolled for acting lessons at the prestigious drama academy, the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute. But she didn't enjoy her years at Beverly Hills High School, where she was constantly teased for wearing glasses and braces and for being so skinny. She also tried to get work as a model, but was turned down for being too short, too thin and too scarred. The teasing and rejection she experienced during her early teenage years had a disastrous effect on her sense of self-esteem, and at the age of 14, she dropped out of high school. She dyed her hair purple, moved in with her punk rocker boyfriend, adopted a Gothic dress code of black, black and more black - but more seriously, began to self-harm and cut herself. She even once asked her boyfriend to draw a blade along her jaw line - and still has a faint scar to mark the occasion.At the age of 16, Angelina split up with her boyfriend, and decided to revive her childhood dreams of becoming an actress. She moved into an apartment opposite her mother and secured her first on-stage role as a German S&M dominatrix! For the first time ever, she also began to make the peace with her father.She realised that when it came to acting he had a great deal to teach her. With her braces and glasses gone, she succeeded in landing work as a model and even appeared in the video for Meat Loaf’s 'Rock’n’Roll Dreams Come Through'. She also appeared in promo videos for Lenny Kravitz and the Rolling Stones.Jolie's brother James (who now called himself James Haven) had pursued his ambition of going to film school, and Angelina gained her first taste of screen acting by starring in no less than five of her brother's student films. She made her movie debut proper in 1993 in the role of Casella 'Cash' Reese alongside Jack Palance in 'Cyborg 2'. Angelina's role capitalised on her screen charisma and brash, upfront sex appeal, and before long she was offered another plum role in 'Hackers', a sci-fi computer thriller. While on set shooting Hackers, she met British actor Johnny Lee Miller, of 'Trainspotting' fame, who played a computer wizard on the run from the police. Jolie and Miller worked closely together (she played a member of his team) and, before long, the couple were announcing their engagement in the press.The Hollywood gossip columnists ventured the opinion that Jolie's marriage was all part of her quest to find some stability in her life, since she’d lacked a father figure whilst she was growing up. But she and Miller were an outlandish and unconventional couple, and Jolie wasted no time in telling the press all about their exploits - in bed and out of it! Her professional life began to blossom, and the offers to star in new films started flooding in. Jolie co-starred with David Duchovny of 'X-Files' fame in the glitzy thriller 'Playing God'.Then came a road movie called 'Mojave Moon', where she played a young girl called Eleanor Rigby who falls in love with Danny Aiello - who in turn happens to be in love with Eleanor’s mother (played by Anne Archer). Next came 'Foxfire', where she played a teenage girl who belonged to a gang who set out to kill a teacher who is bothering them at high school. By now, the major producers in Hollywood had begun to notice that Jolie was able to bring an impressive palette of emotions to her acting, and she began to be offered more complex and demanding parts.In 1997, she played the role of George Wallace's wife in the biographical movie 'George Wallace', which told the story of the segregationist Governor of Alabama who was shot and paralysed during his campaign to become President, a performance which achieved considerable critical acclaim. But whilst her career was going from strength to strength, her private life was starting to fall apart. Johnny Lee Miller was finding her emotional excesses harder and harder to deal with, especially while she was playing the lead role in 'Gia', a biopic about the life of Gia Carangi, a lesbian supermodel from the 1970s who eventually died of AIDS.Jolie was awarded a Golden Globe for her performance in this movie and to celebrate she jumped into a swimming-pool while fully clothed, ruining her expensive designer ball gown. Eventually, Miller decided he couldn’t take any more and the couple finally split.In the wake of her marriage bust-up, rumours were circulating about Jolie's sexuality, and she fanned the flames by openly admitting that she was bisexual. She even confessed to having a relationship with the actress Jenny Shimizu. None of this distracted her from her work, however, and she was soon starring in a comedy drama about air traffic controllers, called 'Pushing Tin'. Her co-stars were John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton, and by the time the film wrapped shooting, she was already in love with Thornton, who was 15 years older than her. Once again, Jolie enjoyed an outrageous, high-profile romance, with Thornton openly admitting that he liked to wear Jolie's underwear, because it made him feel closer to her!Just as she found happiness in her private life, Jolie also struck gold in her career. She accepted the role of a mental asylum inmate in 'Girl, Interrupted', co-starring with Winona Ryder, and won an Oscar for her stellar performance. The Oscar ceremony was marred by rumours that she'd had an incestuous relationship with her own brother, which Jolie denied. She went on to tell the press that she'd only ever slept with a handful of people.Next came Jolie's first blockbuster role - 'Tomb Raider'. This was probably her most challenging role to date, for she not only had to learn how to speak with an English, upper-class accent, but also had to master a wide range of physically demanding disciplines, including kick-boxing, street fighting, yoga, ballet, car-racing and dog-sledding.Her character Lara Croft was faced with the challenge of defeating the Illuminati who were trying to use a magic triangle in order to control Time - and interestingly, the role of her English upper-class father was played by her real-life father, Jon Voight. 'Tomb Raider' marked Jolie’s real breakthrough as a big Hollywood name in her own right, even though she failed to win an Oscar on this occasion.Having reached a peak in her career, Jolie then decided to pursue her humanitarian interests and began to become more and more involved in campaigns to help people in the developing world. In 2001, she adopted a Cambodian child named Maddox, and was made a Good Will Ambassador for the United States. She took her role very seriously indeed, and took time out from her acting career to visit Sierra Leone, Pakistan, Tanzania and the Western Sahara.She began campaigning for peace in troubled Sri Lanka, got involved in helping refugees from Chechnya and Thailand, and donated $5 million to an environmental wildlife sanctuary in Cambodia. When she turned her attention back to her career, she was offered the chance to make 'Tomb Raider 2', for which she was paid a staggering $12 million.Although she was flying high in her work, her private life was in trouble again, and Billy Bob Thornton left her in May 2002. She subsequently claimed he was far more interested in his career than he was in her and Maddox, while she was keen to balance family life and her philanthropic interests with box-office success. After filming Tomb Raider 2, Jolie bought herself a house in Buckinghamshire and was occasionally seen out on the town with her ex-husband Johnny Lee Miller.She continued to give a considerable amount of time to the United Nations, as well as working hard at her career. After the highly successful Tomb Raider sequel, she accepted a part in 'Beyond Borders'. Here she played the daughter of a wealthy businessman who meets a visionary doctor and travels with him to war-ravaged Africa to help save lives. It sounded very much like a case of Jolie's art imitating her own life. Somehow, she even found the time to write a book called 'Notes from My Travels', which was published in 2003.In 2004, she starred in 'Taking Lives' where she played an intuitive detective, co-starring with Ethan Hawke. Hawke's marriage to Uma Thurman collapsed around the same time and Jolie was blamed - but she denied the rumours, and was later proved right.Jolie then took a voiceover role of a glamorous fish called Lola in 'Shark Tale', rapidly followed by the futuristic period piece, 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow', where she played a sexy pilot captain. By coincidence, Jolie had recently gained her pilot's licence, although on this occasion, she didn't fly the plane for real, but acted mostly against green screen.Sadly, Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow wasn't a great box office hit - and nor was 'Alexander', Jolie's next film. Here, she played Olympias, the mother of Alexander the Great, who inspires him to become a great leader and empire builder.But the offers kept coming for Jolie to star in new pictures. After starring in 'The Fever', a political piece directed by Vanessa Redgrave’s son, Carlo Nero, she was offered the starring role in 'Mr and Mrs Smith', where she was cast opposite Brad Pitt.They played a bored couple whose lacklustre marriage gets a shot in the arm when they discover that they are both secret assassins who have been hired to kill each other. Improbable though the plot sounded, the film was a massive hit - not least because romance had once again blossomed for Jolie during the shooting of the movie, and Brad Pitt’s marriage to Jennifer Aniston broke up around the same time.Although rumours ran rife, Jolie and Pitt remained silent about their alleged affair and did not go public about their involvement until a full twelve months later. By this time, Brad Pitt was fully embroiled in the horror of a high-profile Hollywood divorce. Jolie denied Aniston’s claims that she was a marriage-wrecker, and told reporters, 'I was just a shoulder to cry on'.Also during 2005, Jolie found time to get involved in Live8 and visited post-earthquake Pakistan. She adopted Zaharah Marley, a little Ethiopian girl as a sister for Maddox and, to her delight, Brad Pitt decided to adopt both children as his own. And in May 2006, Angelina also gave birth to her own child by Brad Pitt, Shiloh Nouvel, who was born in Namibia whilst the couple were in Africa.With Brad Pitt, Jolie has finally found a partner with whom she can share her humanitarian goals and ideals, as well as her dazzling Hollywood success. While it's certain that the twin challenges of her motherhood and her charity work will continue to take up much of Jolie's time, the movie offers just keep coming.2006 saw the premiere of 'The Good Shepherd', directed by Robert de Niro, which tells the story of the history of the CIA through the eyes of a key operative (played by Matt Damon). But Jolie herself confessed: 'It’s getting harder and harder to go back to work after time with children and my United Nations projects.'In 2007, Jolie made her directorial debut with the documentary 'A Place in Time', which captures the life in 27 locations around the globe during a single week and features fellow actors such as Jude Law, Hilary Swank, Colin Farrell and Jonny Lee Miller. She also voiced the of part Grendel's mother in the animated adaptation of Anglo-Saxon epic poem 'Beowulf', directed by Robert Zemeckis.An Oscar-winning actress, humanitarian ambassador, femme fatale, author, pilot and now mother, Jolie has proved herself brilliantly adept at juggling her many roles - and hopefully will continue to do, for many years to come.Jolie has not let her busy career hold back her plans for an expanding brood, and on 15 March 2007, she adopted Pax Thien from Vietnam, who was three years old at the time.In May 2008, Jolie announced that she was once again pregnant with twins, and her and Brad Pitt's children, Knox Leon and Vivienne Marcheline, were born by caesarean section in Nice, France, on 12 July 2008.On 14 April 2012, it was announced that Jolie and Pitt had become engaged after seven years together. No date has yet been set as the couple once stated they would not marry until same-sex marriage was legalised in every USstate. The actress debuted her diamond ring, which was designed by jeweller Roger Procop with the help of Pitt.Her role in Clint Eastwood's drama 'Changeling', based on real-life events, which premiered at Cannes in 2008, earned the 35-year-old her second Academy Award nomination.The film also saw her nominated for a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her portrayal of Christine Collins, a woman who is reunited with a boy who is said to be her son, but who is in fact a stranger.She took a two year break from filming after 'Changeling', only to return in 2010's 'Salt', a thriller in which she starred alongside Liev Schreiber.Despite receiving mainly negative reviews, Jolie's next film, 'The Tourist', saw her being nominated once again for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.  It seems even when she is attached to a box-office flop, she emerges smelling of roses.In 2011, she went behind the cameras again to direct 'In The Land Of Blood and Honey', which tells the story of a Bosnian soldier who encounters a former lover in a camp he now oversees. It caused some controversy among those who had lived through the war but Jolie's skills were praised by the critics. The same year she returned to 'Kung Fu Panda' and voiced Tigress in 'Kung Fu Panda 2'.She is currently promoting 'Maleficent', which tells the story of Sleeping Beauty from the point of view of her evil nemesis 'Maleficent', played by Jolie. It is set for release in 2014.
