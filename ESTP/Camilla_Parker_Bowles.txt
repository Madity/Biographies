Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall GCVO CSM (Camilla Rosemary; née Shand, previously Parker Bowles; born 17 July 1947),[1] is the second wife of Charles, Prince of Wales, who is the eldest child and heir apparent of Queen Elizabeth II.
Instead of using the title "Princess of Wales", she is styled through her husband's secondary designations as "Duchess of Cornwall" and, in Scotland, "Duchess of Rothesay". These were adopted because of the strong association of the primary title with his first wife, Diana, Princess of Wales.
Camilla is the eldest child of Major Bruce Shand and his wife, The Honourable Rosalind Cubitt, the daughter of British aristocrat the 3rd Baron Ashcombe. She was raised in East Sussex, a county in South East England, and was educated in England, Switzerland and France. Subsequently, she worked for different firms based in central London, most notably the decorating firm Sibyl Colefax & John Fowler. In 1973, Camilla married British Army officer Andrew Parker Bowles, with whom she has two children and five grandchildren. They divorced in 1995, shortly after his retirement from the army.
For many years, Camilla and the Prince of Wales had a controversial relationship, which was highly publicised in the media and attracted worldwide scrutiny.[fn 2] In 2005, it culminated in a civil marriage at Windsor Guildhall, which was followed by a televised Anglican blessing by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.
Camilla was born Camilla Rosemary Shand at King's College Hospital, London, on 17 July 1947 at 7:00 am (BST).[2][fn 3][1] She grew up in the Laines, which is located around Lewes in East Sussex; the house she lived in was near Plumpton Racecourse.[3] Her parents were British Army officer turned wine merchant Major Bruce Shand and his wife Rosalind (née Cubitt), and she has one younger sister, Annabel Elliot. Her younger brother, Mark Shand, died in an accident aged 62 in April 2014.[4] Her maternal great-grandmother, Alice Keppel (the Honourable Mrs George Keppel) was a mistress of King Edward VII from 1898 to 1910.[5] On 1 November 1947, Camilla was baptised at Firle Church, Sussex. Her godparents were Hon. Henry Cubitt (her maternal uncle), Major Neil Speke, Heathcoat Amory, Lombard Hobson and Vivien Mosley.[6][7] The Shands had two homes: one in Plumpton in the Laines, and another in London in South Kensington. During her childhood years, Camilla became an avid reader due to the influence of her father, who read to her frequently.[8] She grew up with dogs and cats,[9] and, at a young age, learnt how to ride a pony by joining pony camps with a pony club, and also learnt how to hunt.[10] According to her, childhood "was perfect in every way."[3] Biographer Gyles Brandreth describes her childhood:
Camilla is often described as having had an "Enid Blyton sort of Childhood." In fact, it was much grander than that. Camilla, as a little girl, may have had some personality traits of George, the tomboy girl among the Famous Five, but Enid Blyton’s children were essentially middle-class children and The Shands, without question, belonged to the upper class. The Shands had position and they had help – help in the house, help in the garden, help with children. They were gentry. They opened their garden for the local Conservative Party Association summer fête. Enough said.[9]
At the age of five, Camilla was sent to Dumbrells, a co-educational school in Ditchling village.[9] She left Dumbrells aged ten to attend the fashionable Queen's Gate School in South Kensington, due to the long distance from her home to Dumbrells. Her family wanted her to be a day student and Queen's Gate School was close to her home.[10] Her classmates while attending Queen's Gate knew her as "Milla"; her fellow pupils included the singer Twinkle. One of the teachers at the school was writer Penelope Fitzgerald, who then taught French; she remembered Camilla as "bright and lively". Camilla left Queen's Gate with one O-level in 1964; her parents did not make her stay long enough for A-levels.[11] At the age of sixteen, she travelled abroad to attend the Mon Fertile finishing school in Switzerland.[12] After completing her course there, she made her own decision and travelled to France to learn French and French literature at the University of London Institute in Paris.[13][14]
On 25 March 1965, Camilla was a debutante in London.[15] According to Peter Townend, an editor of Tatler magazine, she was among 311 debutantes in 1965. Columnist Betty Kenward, who wrote in her column, Jennifer's Diary, published her coming-out party in the Queen magazine.[16] 150 guests attended the event, which was described by Kenward as "successful".[15][17] After moving from home, Camilla lived in a two-bedroom flat at Belgravia on Cundy Street around Victoria Coach Station. She shared the flat with Lady Moyra Campbell, the daughter of the Duke of Abercorn, and later with Virginia Carrington, daughter of the politician Lord Carrington.[18] Virginia was married to Camilla's uncle Henry Cubitt from 1973 until 1979.[19] In 2005, she became a special aide to Camilla and Prince Charles.[20] Camilla worked as a secretary for a variety of firms in the West End and later took a job at the decorating firm Sibyl Colefax & John Fowler in Mayfair.[21] In her spare time, she became an avid equestrienne and participated in fox hunting with the Beaufort Hunt.[22] Her personal interests included horse-riding, gardening, painting and horticulture.[23][24]
In the late 1960s, Camilla met Andrew Parker Bowles—then a Guards officer and lieutenant in the Blues and Royals—[25] through his brother, Simon Parker Bowles; Simon, at the time, worked for her father's wine firm in South Audley Street, Mayfair.[26] The couple dated on and off for some years, though broke up again in 1970, and Parker Bowles began dating Princess Anne; however, the couple later reconciled and announced their engagement in The Times in 1973,[27][28] marrying on 4 July that year at the Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks, London.[29] Camilla was twenty-six years old, while Parker Bowles was thirty-four. Her wedding dress was designed by British fashion house Bellville Sassoon, and the bridesmaids included Parker Bowles' goddaughter Lady Emma Herbert.[30] It was considered the "society wedding of the year"[31] with eight hundred guests in attendance. Royal guests present at the ceremony and reception were Princess Anne, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon.[29][31]
The couple made their home in Wiltshire, purchasing Bolehyde Manor in Allington and later Middlewick House in Corsham.[32] They had two children: Tom, born in the year after their marriage, who became a godson of Prince Charles,[33] and Laura, born in 1978;[34] both children were raised in their father's Roman Catholic faith, although both were married in the Church of England; Tom, like his father, is in remainder to the Earldom of Macclesfield.[25]
In 1995, after twenty–two years of marriage, Camilla and her husband decided to divorce, the same year her mother, Rosalind, died from osteoporosis. Her father later defined this as a "difficult time for her". The couple released a statement on their decision in 1995, stating their divorce was "amicable" and claimed it was due to different interests, which eventually led to separate lives.[35] The divorce was finalised on 3 March 1995.[36]
Camilla and Prince Charles reportedly met in mid-1971.[37] Biographer Gyles Brandreth states that the couple did not meet at a polo match, as it is believed.[38] Instead, they were introduced to each other by a mutual friend, Lucia Santa Cruz.[39][40] They became friends and eventually began dating, which was well known in their social circle. When they became a couple, they regularly met at polo matches at Smith's Lawn in Windsor Great Park, where Charles often played polo.[39] They also became part of a set at Annabel's in Berkeley Square.[37] As the relationship grew stronger, Charles met Camilla’s family in Sussex and he introduced her to some members of his family.[41] The relationship was put on hold after Charles travelled overseas to join the Royal Navy in early 1973; However, it ended abruptly afterwards.[27][42]
There have been different statements on why the couple's relationship ended in 1973. Robert Lacey wrote in his 2008 book, Royal: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, that Charles had met Camilla too early, and that he had not asked her to wait for him when he went overseas for military duties.[43] Sarah Bradford wrote in her 2007 book, Diana, that a member of the close circle of his great-uncle Lord Mountbatten claimed Mountbatten arranged for Charles to be taken overseas to end the relationship with Camilla to make way for an engagement between his granddaughter, Amanda Knatchbull, and Charles.[44] Some sources also suggest the Queen Mother did not approve of the marriage because she wanted Charles to marry one of the Spencer family granddaughters of her close friend, Lady Fermoy.[45] Other sources also suggest Camilla did not want to marry Charles but instead wanted to marry Andrew Parker Bowles since she had an on and off relationship with Parker Bowles that began in the 1960s[46] or that Charles had decided he would not marry until he was thirty years old.[47]
Overall, many royal biographers have agreed that even if Charles and Camilla wanted to marry or did try for approval to get married, it would have been declined, because according to Charles's cousin and godmother Patricia Mountbatten, palace courtiers at that time found Camilla unsuitable as a wife for the future king. In 2005, she stated, "With hindsight, you can say that Charles should have married Camilla when he first had the chance. They were ideally suited, we know that now. But it wasn't possible."[...][48] "it wouldn't have been possible, not then."[...][49]
When Charles heard of the engagement of Camilla and Andrew Parker Bowles in 1973, he wrote to Lord Mountbatten: "I suppose the feeling of emptiness will pass eventually."[50] Nevertheless they remained friends.[51][52] Charles and Camilla rekindled their relationship in 1979. They became close after the IRA assassinated Lord Mountbatten in August 1979.[53] Charles was said to have been grief-stricken and went to Camilla for solace over his death.[54] After becoming aware, Parker Bowles allegedly gave consent to the relationship during their marriage.[55] It did not bother him because he also had relationships with other women.[56] The couple ended their relationship again after Charles married Diana Spencer in 1981.[57]
The affair became public knowledge in the press a decade later, with the publication of Diana: Her True Story in 1992, followed by the Camillagate scandal, wherein intimate telephone conversation between Camilla and Charles was secretly recorded and the transcripts were published in the tabloids.[58] The tape instantly damaged Charles's reputation. Newspapers began publishing articles on how the tape could affect his succession to the throne.[59] Camilla on the other hand was constantly attacked in the press, a friend was quoted as saying "it was hell for her."[60] Nevertheless, she and her husband stayed together. Parker Bowles later released a statement assuring family and friends that everything was well between them.[61]
In 1994, Charles confirmed in a televised interview with Jonathan Dimbleby that the relationship between him and Camilla rekindled after his marriage had "irretrievably broken down" in 1986.[62][63] He told Dimbleby in the interview, "Mrs. Parker Bowles is a great friend of mine...a friend for a very long time. She will continue to be a friend for a long time."[64] Following this, the Parker Bowleses announced their own divorce the following year, having been living apart for some time,[64] a year later Andrew Parker Bowles married his partner Rosemary Pitman.[65] The same year Diana gave an interview on the BBC programme Panorama, during which she was asked if she thought the relationship between Camilla and the Prince of Wales contributed to the breakdown of their marriage, to which she replied: "Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded."[66] Though Camilla kept a low profile at all times, she became unpopular through this claim.[67]
Following the two couples' divorces, Charles stated his relationship with Camilla was, and is, "non-negotiable."[68][69] Charles was aware that the relationship was receiving a lot of negative publicity, and appointed Mark Bolland—whom he had employed in 1995 to refurbish his own image—to enhance Camilla's public profile.[70] Camilla occasionally became Charles's unofficial companion at events. In 1999, the couple made their first public appearance together at the Ritz Hotel in London, where they attended a birthday party; about two hundred cameramen and reporters from around the world were there to witness them together.[71] In 2000, she accompanied Charles to Scotland for a number of official engagements, and in 2001, she became president of the National Osteoporosis Society, which first introduced her to the public.[72] She later met the Queen, for the first time since the relationship was made public, at the 60th birthday party of King Constantine II of Greece. This meeting was seen as an apparent seal of approval by the Queen on Charles and Camilla's relationship.[73][74]
After a series of appearances at public and private venues, the Queen invited Camilla to her Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002. She sat in the royal box behind the Queen for one of the concerts at Buckingham Palace.[75][76] Though she maintained her residence in Wiltshire, Camilla then moved into Clarence House (the former home of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother) which became Charles's household and official residence in 2003.[77] In 2004, Camilla accompanied Charles on almost all of his official events, including a high profile visit together to the annual highland games in Scotland.[78] Throughout, the press speculated on when they would announce their engagement.[79] On 10 February 2005, Clarence House announced their engagement which received a huge amount of coverage in the media worldwide.[80] Polls conducted in the United Kingdom showed overall support for the marriage.[81]

On 10 February 2005, Clarence House announced that Camilla and the Prince of Wales were engaged; as an engagement ring, Charles gave Camilla a diamond ring that was believed to have been given to his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, when she gave birth to her daughter, Queen Elizabeth II.[82] The ring comprises a square-cut diamond with three diamond baguettes on each side;[83][84] As he is the future Supreme Governor of the Church of England, the prospect of Charles marrying a divorcée was seen as controversial, but with the consent of the Queen, Parliament and the Church of England, the couple were able to wed.[85]
The marriage was to have been on 8 April 2005, and was to take place in a civil ceremony at Windsor Castle, with a subsequent religious blessing at St George's Chapel. To conduct a civil marriage at Windsor Castle would oblige the venue to obtain a licence for civil marriages, which it did not have. A condition of such a licence is that the licensed venue must be available for a period of one year to anyone wishing to be married there. As the royal family did not wish to make Windsor Castle available to the public for civil marriages, even just for one year, the location was changed to the town hall at Windsor Guildhall.[86] On 4 April, it was announced that the marriage would be delayed by one day to allow the Prince of Wales and some of the invited dignitaries to attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II.[87][88]
Charles's parents did not attend the marriage ceremony (possibly because the Queen felt unable to attend the remarriage of a divorcee, due to her position as Supreme Governor of the Church of England);[89] neither did Camilla's father; instead, her son and Prince William acted as witnesses to the union.[90] The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh did, however, attend the service of blessing, which included acknowledgment of their transgressions and repentance.[91] Afterwards, a reception was held by the Queen for the newlyweds at Windsor Castle.[92] Performances at the wedding included the St George's Chapel Choir, Philharmonia Orchestra and Welsh composer Alun Hoddinott.[93] As a wedding gift, The Marinsky Theatre Trust in St. Petersburg brought a Russian Contralto singer, Ekaterina Semenchuk to the UK to perform a special song for the couple.[94] Following the wedding, the couple travelled to the Prince's country home in Scotland, Birkhall,[95] and carried out their first public duties as a couple during their honeymoon.[96]
After becoming Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla automatically acquired rank as the second highest female in the United Kingdom Order of Precedence (after the Queen), and as typically fifth or sixth in the orders of precedence of her other realms, following the Queen, the relevant viceroy, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Wales. It was revealed that the Queen altered the royal order of precedence for private occasions, placing Camilla fourth, after the Queen, the Princess Royal, and Princess Alexandra.[97][98] Within two years of the marriage, the Queen extended Camilla visible tokens of membership in the royal family; she lent the Duchess a tiara previously belonging to the Queen Mother,[99] and granted her the badge of the Royal Family Order of Queen Elizabeth II.[100]

In November 2010, the Duchess and her husband were indirectly involved in the 2010 British student protests when their car was attacked by protesters.[101] She was physically attacked when a rioter managed to push a stick into the royal limousine and jab her in the ribs.[102] Clarence House later released a statement on the incident: "A car carrying Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall was attacked by protesters but the couple were unharmed."[103]
On 9 April 2012, the Queen appointed the Duchess of Cornwall to the Royal Victorian Order.[104] The Duchess was a prominent participant in the celebrations for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee during the extended weekend of 2–5 June 2012, especially following the absence of the Duke of Edinburgh owing to ill health on 4–5 June. She stood next to the Queen during the speech by the Prince of Wales at the conclusion of the Diamond Jubilee Concert and was seated next to the Queen the following day in the carriage procession from Westminster to Buckingham Palace.[105]

She conducted the naming ceremony for HMS Astute on 8 June 2007, and, on 10 December, she did the same for the new Cunard cruise ship, MS Queen Victoria,[131] it being said that the Queen had been surprised by Cunard's invitation. In May 2011, she attended the Classic Brit Awards and paid a tribute to James Bond composer and Oscar-winner John Barry with an award for his great contribution to music.[132] In June 2011, the Duchess alone represented the British royal family at the 125th Wimbledon Tennis Championships in Wimbledon.[133] She attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time on 8 May 2013.[134]

She is the first female chancellor of the University of Aberdeen and only member of the royal family to hold the post since it was created in 1860.[142]
In 1994, she became a member of the National Osteoporosis Society after her mother and grandmother died painfully from the disease. She became patron of the charity in 1997 and appointed president in 2001 in a highly publicized event, accompanied by the Prince of Wales.[143] In 2002, she attended the Roundtable of International Women Leaders to Examine Barriers to Reimbursement for Diagnosis and Treatment of Osteoporosis along with 13 eminent women from around the world. The event was hosted by Queen Rania of Jordan and during it, she made her first public speech. The international conference which took place in Lisbon, Portugal, brought together worldwide public figures to focus on osteoporosis treatment and called for government assistance around the world.[144]
In 2006, the Duchess launched the Big Bone walk campaign, which she led 90 children and osteoporosis sufferers on a climb across Balmoral Estate in Scotland to raise money for the charity.[145] The campaign continues almost every year as one of the fundraisers for the charity.[146] She has spoken at more than 60 functions on the disease in the UK and around the world and has also opened bone scanning units and osteoporosis centres to help sufferers of the disease.[143] Almost every year, the Duchess attends and partakes in the World Osteoporosis Day, which was launched by the International Osteoporosis Foundation and is celebrated on 20 October.[147]

The naming of the centre took place on 5 July 2007 in Truro, Cornwall where the hospital is located.[151][152] The National Osteoporosis Society also created The Duchess of Cornwall Award which is awarded to other advocates of Osteoporosis.[153]
After visiting nine rape crisis centres in 2009 and hearing stories by survivors, the Duchess began raising awareness and advocating ways to help sexual assault and rape victims to overcome and move past their trauma. According to The Times, "The stories Her Royal Highness heard on her first visit and the stories she heard subsequently have left her with a strong desire to raise awareness about rape and sexual abuse and to try to help those affected."[154] She often speaks to victims at a rape crisis centre in Croydon and often visits other centres to meet with victims getting help.[155] In 2010, she teamed up with Mayor of London, Boris Johnson and they opened a new centre in Ealing, West London for rape victims. The centre also opened to other areas including Hillingdon, Fulham, Hounslow, and Hammersmith.[156]
In 2013, she held a meeting at Clarence House, which brought together rape victims and rape support groups. Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Theresa May were guests at the occasion. At the occasion, she introduced a plan to help the victims. About 750 wash-bags, packed with luxury toiletries were distributed to victims at the centres. Her staff at Clarence House created the wash-bags. The Duchess thought of the small gesture after visiting a centre at Derbyshire and asked victims what they would like to help them feel at ease after the trauma and forensic examinations. This has been wholly received and appreciated by victims, rape support groups and organizations. According to Clarence House, the event was the first meeting, which was attended by different envoys and high profile figures around the UK to focus exclusively on rape and sexual abuse subjects.[155][157] The same year, the Duchess travelled to Northern Ireland and opened The Rowan, a sexual assault and referral centre at Antrim Area Hospital.[158]

Being an avid reader, the Duchess is an advocate for literacy. She is the patron of the National Literacy Trust and other literacy charities. She often visits schools, libraries and children organizations to read to young children. Additionally, she partakes in literacy celebrations, including International Literacy Day and World Book Day.[160] In 2011, she attended the Hay Festival to support children literacy and while there, she donated books to the Oxfam bookshop.[161] The same year, she donated money to support the Evening Standard's literacy campaign.[162] The Duchess has also launched campaigns and programmes to promote literacy.[163][164]
The Duchess is a supporter of animal welfare and patron of many animal welfare charities including the Langford Trust for Animal Health and Welfare and president of Brooke Hospital for Animals.[165] She often visits other animal shelters to show her support and to see how the animals are cared for.

Camilla's title and style in full: Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cornwall, Duchess of Rothesay, Countess of Chester, Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order.[169]
Because the title Princess of Wales became strongly associated with the previous holder of that title, Diana, Princess of Wales, Camilla has adopted the feminine form of her husband's highest-ranking subsidiary title, Duke of Cornwall.[169] Unless any specific Act of Parliament is passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom (and other Commonwealth states) to the contrary, when Prince Charles becomes king, she can assume by courtesy the style of "Queen Camilla".[170][171] However, Clarence House stated[172] that when Charles becomes king, it is intended that Camilla will adopt the unprecedented style of Princess Consort, similar to the style of Prince Albert. This is not the same usage as her father-in-law, the Duke of Edinburgh, who does not hold the title of Prince Consort.
On the duchess' 58th birthday, Clarence House announced that Camilla had been granted by the Queen a coat of arms for her own personal use. It was reported that the Queen, Charles, and Camilla all took a "keen interest" in the arms' creation, and they were prepared by Peter Gwynn-Jones, Garter Principal King of Arms.[179] The Duchess' coat of arms impale the Prince of Wales' main coat of arms to the dexter, with her father's coat of arms to the sinister.[180]

Aside from the invention of a boar supporter (reflected in her paternal arms) for the sinister side, Camilla's coat of arms is entirely consistent with the historical heraldic arrangement for a married woman who is not a heraldic heiress.
Previous versions were depicted without the Royal Victorian Order, in which she was only appointed in 2012.
According to genealogist William Addams Reitwiesner, the Duchess of Cornwall's ancestry is predominantly French, English, Dutch, and Scottish.[181] Camilla is descended from Arnold Joost van Keppel, who was created the Earl of Albemarle by King William III of England in 1696.[182] His son, Willem van Keppel, 2nd Earl of Albemarle, married Lady Anne Lennox, who was the daughter of Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, illegitimate son of King Charles II. Through Anne Lennox, her bloodline is descended from the House of Stuart.[183] Her great-grandfather, Viscount Bury, was an aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria and among her Treasurer household.[184] Through her great-great-grandfather George Cubitt, who was created the first Baron Ashcombe, she is descended from Thomas Cubitt, a well-known architect during the Victorian era. Cubitt built Queen Victoria's home, Osborne House, and help change and repair Buckingham Palace.[185] He was the father of the Baron.[186] Through Walter Keppel, 9th Earl of Albemarle, she is related to Judith Keppel, the first winner of the top prize on the television game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire. They are second cousins once removed.[181]
Through her French lineage, Camilla's maternal line great-great-grandmother was Sophia Mary MacNab of Hamilton, Ontario, who was the descendant of 17th century immigrants to Quebec, and the daughter of Sir Allan MacNab, who was the Prime Minister of the Province of Canada before Confederation. Sophia was also the wife of William Keppel, 7th Earl of Albemarle.[184] Their son, George, was the husband of Alice Edmonstone, who was a mistress of King Edward VII, the great-great-grandfather of Prince Charles.[187] Also through The Hon. George Keppel on Camilla's side and through the Queen Mother on Charles's side, Camilla and Charles are ninth cousins once removed.[188][189] She is also a descendant of French colonist Zacharie Cloutier, who founded one of the principal families of Quebec City.[5]

'This tiny sliver of land... changed the course of human history':The Queen and Obama lead tributes to D-Day heroes as world leaders join veterans for emotional return to Normandy beaches
        Surrounded by thousands of war graves Her Majesty bowed as she laid a wreath during a poignant service of remembrance in Bayeux, the first town in Normandy to be freed from Hitler's grip after the invasion on June 6 1944. Ten miles away U.S. President Barack Obama spoke at the American War Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer where almost 10,000 U.S troops who died in the Second World War are buried. Flanked by veterans, President Obama said they and their comrades 'turned the tide in that common struggle for freedom' on D-Day. At dawn those who stormed the beaches of Normandy exactly 70 years ago saluted the English Channel to mark the moment the D-Day assault started.

Camilla Parker Bowles is the second wife of Charles, Prince of Wales. Explore this biography to learn more about her childhood, life, works and timeline.
Camilla Parker Bowles, also known as the Duchess of Cornwall and the Countess of Chester, is the second wife of Charles, Prince of Wales. She was in a relationship for 25 long years with him before getting married. The controversial relationship between her and Prince Charles brought her in the prying eyes of the media and led to the eventual divorce between Princess Diana and Prince Charles. Her relationship with Prince Charles eventually culminated in a civil marriage, followed by a televisual blessing by the Archbishop of Canterbury. It has, however, been made clear that while Prince Charles will ascend the throne, Camilla will not be styled as queen and as per ancient customs, she will be conferred the title of 'Princess Consort'. As the public did not initially approve of the liaison, the couple was jeered at and there were a number of speculations. However, she defied all odds and quickly earned the admiration of people. Today, she is revered by the citizens and is an active humanitarian. Camilla is known for being personally discreet and has never, till date, commented on the-then dissolving marriage between Princess Diana and Prince Charles.
Childhood & Early LifeCamilla was born Camilla Rosemary Shand to Rosalind and Major Bruce Shand, a British Army Officer.

Everything / History & Politics / Historical EventsThe Love Affair of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker BowlesHRH the Duchess of Cornwall, formerly Camilla Parker Bowles (né
  e Shand), became famous for being the 'third person' in the marriage between Prince Charles, heir to the British throne and Diana, Princess of Wales. The relationship between 'Fred' and 'Gladys' (as they affectionately nicknamed each other) is thought by some to be one of the greatest royal love stories, comparable to that of Charles's great uncle, King Edward VIII, who famously gave up the throne so that he might marry the woman he loved.This Entry tells the story of their relationship from when they first met in 1970, until their marriage in 2005.Miss Camilla ShandCamilla Rosemary was born in London, England, on 17 July, 1947. She grew up in rural Sussex and was educated at the Queens Gate School in South Kensington, before finishing school in Switzerland and France. Her only claim to fame was that she was a descendant of Alice Keppel, who became King Edward VII's mistress when he was Prince of Wales. So, what better ice-breaker could you use, when introduced to the current Prince of Wales, than mention the fact that your ancestors got it on?Prince Charles was immediately captivated by the 'breath of fresh air', as he later described her. This earthy, sexy, outspoken young woman shared his love of dogs, horses and the countryside. She spoke her mind, which must have been refreshing to a man used to servants and hangers-on. They started a relationship which lasted until the following year, 1971, when Charles joined the Royal Navy.Charles was enjoying his bachelorhood and in no rush to get married. Meanwhile, Camilla had her eye on Andrew Parker Bowles, a handsome cavalry officer (and a godson of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother), who had previously dated Princess Anne, Charles's sister.Camilla Parker BowlesDespite her marriage to Andrew in 1973, Camilla remained close friends with Prince Charles. She helped him choose Highgrove House as his home - conveniently close to her own. He trusted her and she was part of his close circle of friends.Newspapers reported that the night before his wedding to Lady Diana Spencer, in July, 1981, Charles and a 'blonde woman' spent the night on the Royal Train. Diana rightly guessed it was Camilla, but she hoped Charles would eventually grow to love her and forget his old flame. Love doesn't work like that. When he wore a gift from Camilla1 on honeymoon, it was obvious where his heart lay.After Prince William and Prince Harry were born2, the Wales' marriage was over (in private) but the myth of the 'fairytale marriage' was still being perpetuated to the general public. Meanwhile, Charles returned to his mistress 'when it was clear the marriage had broken down'. This could possibly have been as early as 1984, when visiting his wife and newborn son, he voiced his disappointment that the child was not a much-longed-for daughter, and bemoaned the fact that the child had 'the Spencer red hair' probably killed off any lingering doubt that Princess Diana had that her marriage was doomed.Prince Charles did not mention Camilla by name in his famous interview with David Dimbleby on the BBC's Panorama programme, though he did admit committing adultery. This admission signalled the death-knell for the Parker Bowles' marriage and they divorced amicably. Their children Tom3 (born 1974) and Laura (born 1979) lived with their mother but also spent time with their father and his second wife.It is thought that Camilla began living with Prince Charles at Highgrove after her divorce in 1995. Princess Diana had apartments at Kensington Palace and the young princes lived with her there, although they spent time with their father as well. It is well known that Charles never let Camilla and his sons meet.Charles and Diana's separation was announced by Parliament in 1992, but they didn't divorce until 1996. Charles hosted a 50th birthday party for Camilla at Highgrove in July 1997, raising her profile immensely. Achingly slowly, she was becoming accepted as Charles's partner.A month later, in Paris, France, a car crash killed Princess Diana, her lover Dodi al-Fayed and their chauffeur Henri Paul. The grief that gripped the nation at the loss of the beautiful princess turned into a backlash of venom and hatred towards Camilla, who was seen by many as a villainess, the adulterous woman who had wrecked the Wales' marriage as well as her own.It was years before Charles and Camilla stepped out in public together, on the occasion of her sister Annabel's 50th birthday party, in January, 1999. After that there was the first public kiss. Acceptance of Camilla as Charles's partner has been a long and slow public relations effort. Her friends say she's warm and witty and will win public support if they just give her a chance.Camilla Parker Bowles became a patron of the National Osteoporosis Society in 1997. She has raised funds for the Society's research work and education, and helped to raise the profile of the charity. Her mother died of the disease in 1994.Charles once famously remarked that Camilla was 'non-negotiable'. On 10 February, 2005, royal officials announced that the Prince of Wales and his partner Camilla had got engaged with the intention of marrying on Friday, 8 April. The couple appeared for the world's press wearing outfits made from the same material. Camilla's ring had belonged to Charles's late grandmother, the Queen Mother.34 years had passed since their first meeting; with two divorces and four children between them they were 'like a comfy old pair of slippers' and 'just a middle-aged couple getting wed'. Considering that after the marriage Camilla would become the second most important royal female after the Queen (and she would become Queen herself one day), they were unusual remarks for Camilla to make.The Best Laid PlansSome said it was divine intervention, others thought more mysterious spirits were at work. Whatever, things seemed to go wrong from the moment the engagement was announced, and the wedding plans resembled the plot of a soap opera.Charles and Camilla could not be married in church. In the eyes of the Church of England they were adulterers who must carry some blame for the breakdown of their first marriages; also, Mrs Parker Bowles's husband was still alive. The solution was for them to marry in a civil ceremony, and then have their union blessed in a religious service afterwards.Prince Charles wanted the wedding to be at Windsor Castle but when this information was released, a problem was brought to the royals' attention. If the Castle was to be licensed for marriage, then by law the Castle had to be made available for the general public to marry in, for the next three years. As one Researcher remarked at the time:I'd find someone to marry me, just to get married in Windsor Castle.It is not on record what the Queen's reaction to the thought of three years' worth of strangers' nuptials taking place at one of her homes was, but the servants ran for cover.Thus, the venue was changed to The Guildhall, Windsor's Town Hall.Objections were made, even by churchmen, about the legality of the union. The Queen said she wouldn't attend the exchanging of the vows, as she is Defender of the Faith4. However, she agreed to attend the Church Blessing in St George's Chapel, and hosted the reception afterwards.On 2 April, Pope John Paul II died. The Vatican announced that his funeral was going to take place on Friday, 8 April, 2005. The Prince of Wales had long been 'pencilled in' to represent the Queen at the Pope's funeral. Charles cut short his skiing break at Klosters, Switzerland, returning to make arrangements to change the wedding date to Saturday, 9 April. Even the heir to the throne couldn't be in two places at once.Souvenirs had been printed with the date of 8 April and these were snapped up by those eager to make a killing on auction sites such as eBay. These probably outsold new runs with the correct date. The Royal Mail didn't bother to alter their special wedding stamps saying it was 'too late'.Married, FinallyCharles Philip Arthur George Windsor - occupation 'Prince of the United Kingdom' - age 56 years - previous marriage dissolved and Camilla Rosemary Parker Bowles - occupation left blank - age 57 years - previous marriage dissolved, were booked to marry at 12.30pm. Television cameras were stationed outside Windsor Guildhall and waited for the royal guests to arrive. 20,000 well-wishers turned up to cheer the bride and groom. A few boos could be heard but the band struck up a loud tune and drowned them out.Ignoring tradition by travelling to the ceremony together (in the Queen's Rolls-Royce Phantom VI) Charles, resplendent in his morning suit, and his radiant bride arrived right on time. Camilla wore an elegant oyster silk coat over a matching chiffon dress created for her by Robinson Valentine. On her right collar she wore a Prince of Wales feathers brooch. Her wide-brimmed hat (designed and made by Philip Treacy), was made of natural straw, covered in French lace, and trimmed with ostrich feathers.The legalities took place behind closed doors, but the Blessing, led by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams was broadcast live. Camilla had changed outfits and arrived on her husband's arm, dressed in a sensational floor-length porcelain blue silk gown under a medieval-style brocade overcoat with hand-stitched gold embroidery. Her earlier hat had been replaced by a stunning gold-leafed feather headdress, tipped with Swarovski crystal diamonds, also by designer milliner Treacy.After the ceremony they greeted specially-invited well-wishers. Camilla seemed reluctant to get back in the Rolls; she was happy meeting her new fans. Prince Charles was seen to ask his new wife twice to 'Get in the car, dear!'At a private reception, the guests were treated to egg-and-cress sandwiches, mini Cornish pasties and scones. The newlyweds were toasted by the Queen: Despite Becher's Brook and The Chair and all kinds of other terrible obstacles, my son has come through and I'm very proud and wish them well.The Queen is well known for her love of horses (and horse racing) and her speech was a play on words, comparing the run-up to the wedding with completing the Grand National, which was being held the same day. The couple left for their honeymoon in Scotland, during which they officially opened a children's playground. The new Duchess of Rothesay5 wore a suit of Rothesay tartan for her first royal engagement.The FutureSo begins HRH the Duchess of Cornwall's royal life. As Charles's wife, she can now accompany him on royal tours and when he represents the Queen on state occasions. Should Prince Charles become King Charles III, she will be Queen Consort as this is not a morganatic6 marriage. A morganatic marriage is usually between a couple of unequal social rank. It prevents the wife (and any children born of the marriage) from inheriting the husband's titles and privileges. The Prince's advisors have stated that Camilla will be known as 'Princess Consort', not Queen, when the time comes. However, it would require an Act of Parliament for Camilla not to be crowned beside her husband. 1 Cufflinks with the initials C and C intertwined.2 The 'heir and the spare'.3 Prince Charles's godson.4 The title bestowed upon King Henry VIII by Pope Leo X, in 1521.5 Camilla's title in Scotland.6 The concept does not exist in British law.Discuss this EntryPeople have been talking about this Guide Entry.

Camilla Parker-Bowles -- now titled Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall -- is the second wife of Britain's Prince Charles. The two met in the early 1970s, becoming friends and then romantic partners. Both later were married to others (Camilla to Army captain Andrew Parker-Bowles in 1973, and Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981), but their friendship endured. Parker-Bowles and her husband divorced in 1995 and Charles and Diana divorced in 1996; Charles later admitted that he and Parker-Bowles had been romantically involved even when both still were married. After Diana's death in 1997, Parker-Bowles became recognized as Charles's steady companion and partner, amid much public chatter about the propriety of their relationship and her eventual role should Charles become king. The two were married in a civil ceremony on 9 April 2005, and their union was blessed the same day in a ceremony at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.  She was then given the formal title of Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall.
Extra credit: One of Prince Charles's many titles is the Duke of Cornwall -- hence the name Duchess of Cornwall for Camilla. She will not be called Queen Camilla if and when Charles becomes king... Their original wedding date of April 8th was changed to April 9th after the funeral of Pope John Paul II was scheduled for the 8th... Camilla Parker-Bowles has two children with her former husband: Tom (b. 1975) and Laura (b. 1979)... Charles's great-uncle King Edward VIII and aunt Princess Margaret also had trouble with royal romances in the face of the Church of England's traditional rules against marriage after divorce... Camilla is the great-granddaughter of Alice Keppel, one of King Edward VII's paramours.
=======================================================
Prince Charles always made it clear that his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles was "non-negotiable". And, despite the controversy it provoked, he remained true to his word, championing the divorced mother-of-two and gradually making her role in his life increasingly prominent.						
						Born Camilla Shand in London on July 17, 1947, Camilla was educated in London and "finished off" in Switzerland and France. The granddaughter of Lord Ashcombe, she grew up on a country estate in Sussex, spending much of her free time hunting.
Self-confident Milla, as she was known, met the shy, 25-year-old Prince Charles at Windsor Great Park in the early Seventies. Friendship grew into romance, with Camilla often spending time in the Prince's apartments in Buckingham Palace. Believing Charles would never propose, Camilla married Army officer Andrew Parker Bowles shortly after the heir to the throne was sent abroad on a naval mission. Camilla and Andrew had two children, Tom, born in 1975, and Laura, born four years later.
But her friendship with the Prince endured, and Camilla became a constant in his life even after his 1981 wedding to Lady Diana Spencer. The fairytale marriage was not without its difficulties, however, and Charles and Diana announced their separation in December 1992. Camilla, still a trusted member of the Prince's inner circle, immediately offered Charles her support and comfort.
The down-to-earth, outdoorsy woman came under the public spotlight after Charles confirmed he had commited adultery with Camilla while still married to Diana. As controversy raged around her, Camilla chose to remain silent. 
Her marriage to Andrew ended in divorce in January 1995, and the former Cavalry officer went on to marry Virginia Pitman just a year later.
After Diana's tragic death in August 1997, Camilla retreated from the public eye. It appears to have been Charles' son Prince William who extended the olive branch to his father's companion by inviting her to tea. At the request of the young Prince and his brother Harry, Mrs Parker Bowles also accompanied Charles and his sons on a Mediterranean cruise in August 1999.
The couple began to undertake public engagements together, and were often snapped in each other's company on social occasions. With speculation over Camilla's role in the life of Britain's future sovereign mounting, on February 10, 2005, Clarence House announced Charles and Camilla were to wed at Windsor Castle on April 8.
Though naysayers began to brand the wedding as "jinxed" after a number of obstacles arose - including a switch of venue to the more humble Windsor Guildhall, and a one-day postponement when the original date conflicted with Pope John Paul II's funeral - the April 9 nuptials went without a hitch.
After tying the knot with Charles in a brief civil ceremony witnessed by just 30 guests, Camilla, in a long porcelain blue gown, walked down the aisle alongside her Prince for a prayer service at St George's Chapel attended by 700. The blessing was followed by a lavish Windsor Castle reception, before the longtime couple set off for their honeymoon in Scotland.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Camilla Parker-Bowles was born on July 17, 1947 in Denmark Hill, London, England as Camilla Rosemary Shand. She has been married to Prince Charles since April 9, 2005. She was previously married to Andrew Parker-Bowles.
      10 February 2005: engagement to Prince Charles announced. The civil wedding will take place in Windsor Castle on 8 April 2005. She will use the title HRH The Duchess of Cornwall from then on.
      The Royal wedding was moved to Saturday to allow Charles to attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II at the Vatican on Friday 8 April.
      Legally she is entitled to use the style "HRH the Princess of Wales", but (with the Queen's permission) she is styled "HRH the Duchess of Cornwall" everywhere but Scotland. In Scotland she is styled "HRH the Duchess of Rothesay" since her husband is the Duke of Rothesay.

From Chapter One – “I grew up in a world of violence and unpredictability. I learned to protect myself the best I could. I learned to take care of myself because no one else would. I learned to lie, to conceal, and to cover my fear with anger and violence.
