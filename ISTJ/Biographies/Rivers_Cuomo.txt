Rivers Cuomo (/ˈkwoʊmoʊ/; born June 13, 1970) is an American musician, singer and songwriter who is best known as the lead vocalist, lead guitarist and principal songwriter of the alternative rock band Weezer. Raised in an ashram in Connecticut, Cuomo moved to Los Angeles at age 19, where he participated in a number of rock bands before founding Weezer in 1992. With Weezer, he has released nine studio albums.
In addition to fronting Weezer, Cuomo has also worked as a solo artist. In December 2007, he released Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo, which featured home demos that Cuomo recorded from 1992 to 2007. He released another album, Alone II: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo, in November 2008. Alone III: The Pinkerton Years was released in December 2011.[1]
Rivers Cuomo was born in a Manhattan hospital to parents of Italian[2] and German/English descent, and raised on an ashram, run by the late yoga master Sri Swami Satchidananda in Pomfret, Connecticut. His mother, Beverly, was inspired to name her son "Rivers" because he was born between the East and Hudson rivers in Manhattan. Her appreciation of the sound of running water further reinforced her desire for this name. His father, Frank Cuomo, was a musician who played drums on the album Odyssey of Iska by jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter.[3][4]
During his early childhood Cuomo attended a private school on an ashram where his parents raised him and his brother Leaves.[5] Cuomo's parents moved to nearby Storrs, Connecticut when the ashram (known as Yogaville) was relocated to a plot of land along the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia.[6] Cuomo attended E.O. Smith High School in Storrs, Connecticut and changed his name to Peter Kitts,[7] but reverted to his original name once he moved to Los Angeles after high school.[8] In high school, Cuomo played the role of Johnny Casino in the stage production of Grease.[9][10]Cuomo went on to attend Harvard University, attending classes on and off from 1995 to 2006. Cuomo graduated Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Arts in English and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. [11][12]
After a series of musical projects in Los Angeles, Cuomo formed Weezer on February 14, 1992, with members from Sixty Wrong Sausages, including drummer Patrick Wilson. The original Weezer line-up included Cuomo on vocals and guitar, Wilson on drums, Matt Sharp on bass, and Jason Cropper who at first played exclusively on acoustic guitar. Weezer signed with DGC, a subsidiary of Geffen Records, on June 25, 1993. They began recording Weezer (also known as The Blue Album) in August 1993 at Electric Lady Studios in New York with producer Ric Ocasek. "Weezer" was Rivers' childhood nickname, given to him by his father when he was a toddler, although it wasn't because he had asthma.[13]
Throughout 2002, Cuomo frequently posted on Weezer message boards as 'Ace' to discuss music with fans. He once had a website called the 'Catalog of Riffs' ('COR') in which he shared old demos of songs as well as scans of many personal items (letters, schedules, records).[14][15] Since 2003 he has kept a MySpace page in which he has posted many blog entries including his original admission essay and two subsequent readmission essays to Harvard. Additionally he uses his MySpace blog as a clearinghouse for clarifications, corrections, and addenda to interviews and press reports about him. (This has included responding to misinformation on his Wikipedia entry.)[16]
Starting on the Foozer tour in late 2005, Cuomo would invite fans onto the stage to play "Undone – The Sweater Song" on acoustic guitar. After the performance, fans were allowed to keep the guitars they played. In 2008, coinciding with the release of Weezer's new album, The Red Album, Weezer announced a "Hootenanny Tour" in which radio stations would audition fans to play songs live with Weezer. This "hootenanny" style performance was replicated for the band's "Troublemaker" video and on their 2008 Troublemaker Tour. On November 25, 2008, Cuomo invited a small group of guests to a jam session at Fingerprints Records in Long Beach, CA. This marked the release of Alone II: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo. Fans chose the songs and played the instruments while Cuomo sang.[17]
One of Cuomo's earliest music projects was a progressive metal band known as Avant Garde.[18] Cuomo played under the name Peter Kitts, Kitts being the surname of his stepfather. The band played several shows in Connecticut. He moved with the band to Los Angeles in March 1989.[19] In late 1989 Avant Garde changed its name to Zoom though the band dissolved in the late spring of 1990.[20][21] Before Weezer, Cuomo worked as a roadie for King Size on their Guatemala tour.[14] During a Weezer hiatus, Cuomo formed a musical project called Homie, consisting of what he called "goofball songs" or his "country band". An album was planned, but only one studio recording, a song titled "American Girls", has been released. Cuomo has contributed to recordings by various other musicians (Crazy Town, Cold, Mark Ronson). He also briefly managed the band AM Radio in 2002 and 2003.
In early 2004, he made a surprise appearance onstage with Matt Sharp California State University, Fullerton show to play two old Weezer favorites ("Say It Ain't So" and "Undone"), a rare Weezer demo that they worked on together ("Mrs. Young"), and a new song they wrote together, "Time Song." Also, Sharp announced that they might work on a collaborative record together. But later that year, Sharp announced on his website that although they had come up with "15 or 16 new song ideas, some good, some not so good" for their new album, their "special brand of dysfunctionality" may keep them from finishing the project.[22]
In March 2008, Cuomo started a video series on YouTube called "Let's Write a Sawng."[23] Cuomo wrote a song in collaboration with YouTube users' suggestions. The end result was "Turning Up The Radio" which appeared on "Death to False Metal".[24]
Cuomo has had cameos in a number of music videos. These include Crystal Method's "Murder" and the video for The Warlocks' "Cocaine Blues." Cuomo also makes a guest appearance on Sugar Ray's "Boardwalk", the first single on their latest album, Music for Cougars. Cuomo featured on the song "Magic", on B.o.B's debut album B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray which was released in April 2010. In a May interview with HitQuarters, producer-songwriter Lucas Secon confirmed that he had recently worked with Cuomo on both a Steve Aoki single and "some Weezer stuff."[25]
In 2011, Cuomo collaborated with Japanese singer Hitomi for her first independent album Spirit, in the duet "Rollin' with da Homies", which was co-written by him. He was also featured on the Simple Plan song "Can't Keep My Hands Off You"[26] and Miranda Cosgrove's song, "High Maintenance".
In 2013, Cuomo released a Japanese language rock album with Scott Murphy of Allister.,[27] under the name Scott & Rivers. The self-titled album debuted at #1 on the iTunes Japan alternative charts on the week it was released. The album is currently available physically only in Japan, and digitally worldwide through iTunes.[28]
On June 18, 2006, Cuomo married Kyoko Ito, whom he had known since March 1997.[29] He proposed to her in Tokyo shortly before Christmas of 2005.[30] The wedding was held at a secluded beach on Paradise Cove in Malibu and was attended by six of the seven members who played in Weezer (Mikey Welsh being the only no show) as well as notables Kevin Ridel and Rick Rubin.[31] The couple have a daughter, Mia, who was born in May 2007 and a son, Leo, who was born in 2012.
Cuomo was born with his left leg 44 mm (13⁄4 in) shorter than his right leg. After the success of The Blue Album, Cuomo underwent the Ilizarov procedure to correct the condition. This involved the surgical breaking of the bone in his leg, followed by several months of wearing a steel brace which required self-administered "stretching" of the leg four times daily; Cuomo likened the ordeal to "crucifying [his] leg."[32] An x-ray of the leg is part of the album art for "The Good Life" single, and the experience inspired him to write the song. Cuomo can be seen wearing the brace on an episode of the Late Show with David Letterman, which can be found on their DVD Video Capture Device.
On December 6, 2009, Cuomo was in his tour bus driving to Boston from Toronto with his family and assistant when the bus hit an icy road in Glen, New York and crashed. He suffered cracked ribs and internal bleeding. Due to this accident, Weezer canceled the rest of the 2009 tour dates, planning to reschedule them the following year.[33] The band made their return to the stage on January 20, 2010, performing at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida.
Cuomo has followed a vegetarian diet throughout his life. [34] However, in 2002, he told an interviewer that he might like to start eating meat regularly and claimed to have done so in the past, eating "some kind of barbecued beef in Tokyo."[35]
Cuomo practices Vipassana meditation and is a student of S.N. Goenka.[36] As of mid-2009 he also teaches children's meditation as taught by S.N. Goenka.[37] Cuomo helped acquire music rights and provided financial support to a 2007 documentary titled The Dhamma Brothers about Vipassana meditation being instituted in an Alabama state prison.[38]
Cuomo is a fan of soccer. In 2006 he wrote a song titled "My Day Is Coming" in tribute to the U.S. men's soccer team,[39] and followed it up for 2010 by writing "Represent", which he considers to be an "unofficial" anthem for the U.S. team. The latter song was released as a Weezer single on June 11, the day before Team USA's World Cup opener against England.[40] His favorite soccer player is Landon Donovan. He supports the U.S. Men's National team, Los Angeles Galaxy and English side Sheffield Wednesday.[41] In early 2008 he played in the Mia & Nomar Celebrity Soccer Challenge and scored a goal in the game. His video for "Lover in the Snow" off of his Alone album dealt with this game and his love of soccer.[40] He was also a backer for "Rise & Shine: The Jay DeMerit Story"[42] In August 2009, Cuomo also participated in the Athletes for Africa 5v5 Charity Soccer Tournament in Toronto, Canada alongside actor Michael Cera. During many of Weezer's performances, Rivers would go to the side of the stage and play football (kicking the ball against a goal and/or a wall), at the beginning and end of the band's set.
Some of Cuomo's fashion trademarks include his black glasses and his lightning bolt guitar strap. He has sported a bowl cut, most notably in the music video for "Undone - The Sweater Song". Other notable fashion trends include sporting a life preserver-styled vest,[43] growing a thick beard in mid-2002[44] and a brief suit-and-tie phase in summer 2002.[45] Cuomo has also been seen with a short moustache in the video for "Pork and Beans" and on the Red Album cover. Cuomo has said that he grew the moustache in honor of his daughter and that his father wore one just like his when Cuomo was born. During Weezer's hiatus between the albums Pinkerton and Weezer (Green Album), Cuomo had braces on his teeth. They were evidently removed before the release of the Green Album.[46]
Cuomo has cited a wide variety of musical influences throughout the years, from artists as diverse as the Beatles, Kiss, Nirvana, Giacomo Puccini, Lou Barlow, Pixies, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Sonic Youth. He has stated the work of Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys, particularly on the album Pet Sounds, inspired the more melodic approach he took to songwriting in the early nineties.[47] Cuomo took it upon himself to become a student of rock and pop music and in the late 90s, Cuomo created "The Encyclopedia of Pop" for himself, a three-ring binder which broke down the mechanics of pop and rock songs featuring songs by Nirvana, Green Day and Oasis.[48][49]
He almost never swears in any of his songs and often uses minced oaths such as "bee-yotch" instead of "bitch" (with the exception of "Butterfly" and "The Good Life" from Pinkerton). He attributes this to The Beach Boys, saying "Weezer came up at a time when Jane's Addiction released Nothing's Shocking—everyone was trying to be controversial. We looked back to rock & roll's pre-drug days—to the clean images of the Beach Boys—that felt, ironically, rebellious."[50] The word "fucking" does appear on Raditude's "Can't Stop Partying", but it is used by guest rapper Lil Wayne, not by Cuomo. He also uses the word "Goddamn" in the first verse of "The Sweater Song", the third verse of "Across the Sea", the opening of "El Scorcho", and the bridge in "Falling for You".
He has been known to use experimentation to inspire his writing, for example, fasting for a day and then writing a song, as he did on "Hold Me."[51] Cuomo has familiarity with a wide array of musical instruments: besides the guitar, he is also skilled at the piano, and bass guitar (he frequently demoed songs on his own, a la the 1995 Fort Apache Studios Pinkerton demos, and can be seen playing the bass in the Weezer DVD Video Capture Device). Cuomo also plays clarinet (as heard on Alone and SFTBH track "Longtime Sunshine" and the .com-released demo "Clarinet Waltz"), drums (as heard on Alone, in concerts during "Photograph", two songs on the red album and some tracks on Hurley), trumpet (as heard on "Victory on the Hill" from "Alone II") and harmonica.
He is known to perform with customized Stratocasters, most famously a Sonic Blue Warmoth model with a tortoise pickguard and fitted with DiMarzio and Seymour Duncan humbucking pickups, which he used during the Blue album/Pinkerton era. The other guitar he is seen using most is the Gibson SG. He has several models in Cherry and White. Since 2012, he has been using Stratocasters that were used during the 2000-2001 tours. His main guitar is one in Seafoam Green and a backup in Sonic Blue similar to the original one. These guitars are usually covered in stickers or in the case of the original Sonic Blue Strat, electrical tape, as seen in several music videos. [52] Cuomo also notably played Gibson V's[53] and Explorers onstage in late 2001 and throughout parts of 2002. He could also briefly be seen using an Explorer in the music video for "Beverly Hills". His SGs are often adorned with a sticker of the Thai word Farang, meaning "a white foreigner."[54] The sticker is found on the SG that he keeps in E flat tuning; a second SG, usually tuned to E, does not have this sticker.
He has been known to use a range of amplifiers. His first "big" amp was a Randall RG100ES solid state head. He would soon get rid of this amp in favor of an original Mesa/Boogie Mark I amplifier, which was used to record all of the debut Weezer album. He wouldn't use the amp live. Instead, he relied on a Marshall JCM 900 SL-X. He would also eventually rid of the JCM 900 and use another Marshall amp head, the 6100LM 30th Anniversary amp, which he discovered on the set of the Late Show with David Letterman. This would be his main recording and touring amp until the Green album when it became strictly a touring amp until around 2001.
For recording the Green album, he relied on a Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier and a modified Marshall amp previously owned by Warren DeMartini of the metal band Ratt. A Vox AC30 was also used on several songs. He would continue to use the 6100, along with bringing back the JCM 900, for a while until the band was forced to change up their rig due to budget and shipping restrictions. The entire band eventually got rid of using amps entirely, switching to a single rack that consisted of 2 Line 6 POD Pros and 1 Bass POD Pro. This would be the main gigging setup until later in the same year, when the band eventually went back to using real amps, starting with a Marshall JCM2000 DSL100. This would be their main amp until the Make Believe sessions, when a Diezel VH4 was brought in. This would be Rivers' main amp and is still used today.

Rivers Cuomo (born June 13, 1970) is a Grammy-nominated musician, best known as the lead singer, guitarist, and principal songwriter of the rock band Weezer. He has also worked as a solo artist; he released his debut album, Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo, in December 2007, which featured home demos that Cuomo has recorded from 1992-2007. Cuomo mainly plays electric guitar and acoustic guitar, but he can also play drums, bass guitar, clarinet, harmonica, and piano.  Throughout the years he has entertained several different facial hair styles.
Rivers Cuomo was born on June 13, 1970 in Manhattan to father Frank Cuomo and mother Beverly Shoenberger.  His mother claims he was named "Rivers" because she first heard the sound of a river outside her hospital window after Rivers' birth.  His father claims that he was named after three players from the Soccer World Cup of 1970: Rivelino, Riva, Rivera; all three of which played one another one week after June 13.  Rivers was, according to his brother, Leaves, almost named "Apple"--most likely because he was born in New York City.  Rivers was raised in upstate New York at the Buddhist Zen Center.  There, Rivers' father farmed cows until he left the family in 1975.  Afterward, he was mostly absent from Rivers' youth.  Rivers and Leaves followed their mother, Beverly, to Yogaville where Rivers remained for the rest of his childhood.  There, Rivers was known as "Rama."  Said Rivers, "You have to realize we were living in an enclosed community of Hindus.  We lived in an ashram.  Isn't that insane?...It was a very mellow childhood."  Beverly remarried to Stephen Kitts who became Rivers' stepfather.
When Rivers was enrolled at the Pomfret Community School (taught by Mrs. Anderson), he was "a very somber child."
"My teacher asked my mother what was wrong with me because I never looked happy.  So, my mother advised her to say, 'Let me see that smile,' and then I would smile.  So she did that -- in front of the whole class.  She got the whole class to turn around, look at me and say, 'Let me see that smile.'"
Rivers' first musical love was Kiss.  In 1977, a young girl whom Rivers was friends with (presumably the one on the Buddy Holly single) played Rivers the Kiss record, Rock and Roll Over.  Rivers would later say that this "directed the course of [his] life."
"We were all about six or seven years old.  And when we heard 'Makin' Love' or 'I Want You' off that record, we just lost our minds.  The guitar was so exciting!  I remember we'd all just run around the room in circles, playing air guitar and jumping off the furniture."
Around 1980, Yogaville moved to Virginia.  Rather than following it, the Kitts family (Beverly, Stephen, Rivers and Leaves) remained in Connecticut moving to Storrs Mansfield.  There, the family lived at an apartment in Warrenville and eventually a home on South Eagleville Rd in the Summer of 1983.  Once out of the commune, Rivers and Leaves began to prepare for public schools.  According to Rivers, they taught each other to swear to fit in.  Furthermore, Rivers joined the Columbia Record Club and bought all the Kiss albums he could.  Said Rivers, "I bought twelve albums for one penny or something.  Within that package was Eddy Rabbit, Abba, Queen...I think they all had a tremendous impact."  Clearly they did - two out of three of those artists are mentioned in 2008's "Heart Songs".
Shortly after entering Mansfield Middle School, Rivers' mother and her friend arranged for Rivers to play with Justin Fisher, who would become Rivers' lifelong friend.  According to Rivers, him and Leaves had "the crap beaten out of [them]" at school.  Rivers attributes his shyness to bullying.
Upon entering public school, both Rivers and Leaves began to go by the last name of Kitts (their stepfather) rather than Cuomo.  According to Justin, Rivers and Leaves' parents permitted them to go by new first names to help them fit in better.  Rivers chose the name "Peter" making his name Peter Kitts.  It is likely he chose this name because of it's similarity to "Peter Criss".  Rivers and Justin quickly became the best of friends.  The two shared much in common such as Dungeons & Dragons, music and soccer.  Said Rivers, "I gravitated toward the, uh...elven, or half-elven; something with high dexterity."
According to Rivers, he was very athletic in his youth.  In the Lover in the Snow video, Rivers discusses his diagnosis with a leg problem.  Rivers had a rare case of "congenital femur 'something or other'" (as Beverly phrased it in a letter to family and friends).  The condition would worsen as Rivers got older.  According to Rivers, his desire to be an athlete soon faded as his leg grew worse.  As a result, Rivers decided to be a rock star.
In 7th grade, Rivers got Justin into Kiss; at the time, Justin was a fan of The Beatles and The Beach Boys.  From Kiss, Rivers went on to discover metal bands like Scorpions and pop bands like Men At Work, which was Rivers' first concert.
At an 8th grade talent show, Rivers and Justin witnessed some classmates covering "Metal Health" by Quiet Riot.  Rivers and Justin noticed girls rushing the stage and "everyone freaking out", so the two decided to form their own band, Fury.  Inspired by the performance, Rivers asked his parents to buy him a guitar for his fourteenth birthday.  On June 13, 1984, Rivers received his first guitar, a Stratocaster copy.  Rivers learned the Ace Frehley solos and would attempt to play them for his mother.  Said Rivers, "I'd play her the 'Shock Me' solo from Alive II because I thought that was the greatest.  She told me that it sounded like a dying cat."  The first song Rivers wrote was "Fight For Your Right".  Rivers described it as, "...a Kiss style heavy metal anthem.  It's funny that I basically do the same thing now.  Come up with a metal riff and sing it.  I've barely evolved."  Tuning into local radio, Rivers got into Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, both of whom later would Rivers sing "taught [him] how to shred."
Rivers identified with heavy metal and felt that it was the sound of his generation.  He chose to identify himself as a "metalhead."  Rivers once took a Quiet Riot album cover to the hair salon and said, "Make me look like Carlos Cavazo".  He then said, "My mom got so upset, she got in the car and drove home without me, which was, like five miles away."
Ten days after Rivers received his first guitar, Fury began holding rehearsals.  Fury was the band Rivers formed with Leaves, Justin and their mutual friend Eric Robertson.  In September of 1984, Fury played their first show.
As Rivers entered high school with his guitar, he began to seek out more technical guitar players while still remaining loyal to Kiss.  Rivers would only allow Kiss posters on the walls of his room, but in his guitar practice room, he put up the posters of other inspiring musicians including Scorpions, Priest, Yngwie Malmsteem and Paul Gibert.  Rivers managed to see a Kiss concert with Justin on the leg of the Animalize tour.  They also saw the Scorpions.
Rivers attended E.O. Smith High School, which is also where Rivers drew the name for his music publishing.  In high school, Rives continued to develop his metal image while retaining his nerdy habits such as comic book superheroes and Dungeons & Dragons.  According to Rivers, him and his small group of metalheads were the constant victims of bullying by jocks and grits.  This inspired Rivers and Justin to take up karate.  Rivers had a strong interest in east Asia and still does today.  According to Justin, it was that interest in Asia which also inspired the pair to take up martial arts.
In high school, Rivers was unsure of where he was supposed to fit in.  Said Rivers, "I went to my parents' Zen master and I said, 'Life is shit.  I want to shave my head and do this.'  He's like, 'You know what?  Being a monk is shit too, so I can't advise that for you.  What you should do is really listen to yourself and see what path would make you the most excited and just go do that, however crazy it seems.'  It took me about five seconds, and I was like, 'I want to be a rock star'."
One year after Fury's formation, Rivers wanted to play a heavier metal and his friend Justin agreed.  The two began writing as members drifted in and out.  At the time, Rivers was writing his own guitar parts as well as covering Metallica and Connecticut natives Fates Warning.  He even went so far as to take guitar lessons from Fates Warning's Jim Matheos.  Eventually, Rivers and Justin would call the band "Avant Garde".  Rivers has since said, "We were anything but."  Eventually, Kevin Ridel was cast as the lead singer.
Rivers took Avant Garde incredibly seriously and had the band rehearsing four times a week for hours on end.  Any member that Rivers thought was not taking the music seriously, he kicked out.  First, Eric Ridel, their rhythm guitarist was kicked out for partying.  Even Justin Fisher was confronted by Rivers about his one night of partying.
Rivers had a profound influence on members of the band.  Even at E.O. Smith, Rivers was considered to be the leader of ten to twelve heavy metal fans by his junior year.  Rivers has referred to himself as "an outsider, but...I've always been a leader too.  I always had a group with me.  I gradually attracted a really close group of outsiders to me."
At sixteen, Rivers received his license and a Toyota Tercel from his parents.  The Toyota was a huge part of "getting dangerous", as Rivers and his friends called it.  Rivers sang about getting dangerous on 2008's Weezer in the song "Everybody Get Dangerous".  Adam Orth said, "Rivers used to have this Toyota Tercel and he would drive me and Justin (and sometimes Matt Hayes) home after school...This one particularly steep hill on Gurleyville road that led down to Justin’s house was epic...  Rivers would be driving and without warning (it was never guaranteed this game would commence at the top of the hill. Always random.), Rivers would throw the car in neutral and rip the keys out of the ignition and toss them in the back seat as the steering wheel locked-up and the car careened down this deadliest of hills.
The object of the game was for the screaming and terrified (and laughing) passengers to try and find the keys and get them back to Rivers in time so he could start the careening death trap up again and unlock the steering wheel to regain control of the car before we got to the bottom and died in a heap of twisted metal."
In high school, Rivers had a friendly relationship with his music instructor, Kenneth Holton, who encouraged Rivers to play Johnny Casino in the school's production of Grease!.  "He was fascinated by heavy metal", said Holton, "but that didn't seem to affect him when it came to my groups.  He didn't blow me off because I was a classical theorist.  He had very teased long hair all around his head...  I guess he thought he was playing the part of a rock star."  Still, Rivers claims to have been very aware he was not a rock star in high school.  As a freshman, he has said they were picked on.  By eleventh grade, he claims they were tolerated.  Finally, by senior year, Rivers' said his group had respect.
When Rivers entered his last year of high school at seventeen, he was secretly appreciating all music, not just metal.  Rivers was a fan of the Beatles and the Beach Boys, as well as popular artists of the '80s like Madonna and Prince.  He also was a patron of classical music performances.  Around this time, Avant Garde was also recording their own material.
To advance his guitar skills, Rivers applied and was accepted to the Berklee School of Music program in Boston.  The five week music program would allow Rivers to eventually meet his future Avant Garde guitarist replacement.  Rivers quickly befriended one Michael Stanton.  Michael claimed he wanted to approach Rivers and his quickly formed gang of rockers, but was unsure quite how he could.  One day, Michael was playing Master of Puppets on guitar.  Rivers heard it, knocked on his door and the two "hit it off really well" (Stanton).  "We did everything together.  It was a really fun time.  We'd record wicked instrumental guitar songs on a 4-track.  One was called 'Plankton Frito,' and it had a mean sounding Phrygian harmonized riff" (Stanton).
The two also spent hours writing out elaborate counterpoint dual guitar solos and recording them.  Other than playing guitar, Rivers, Mike and some of their friends would go out for pizza at night or take the subway around.  They also saw Ricky Horror Picture Show.  Together, the two honed their sense of relative pitch. After the music program, Rivers convinced Mike to move to Connecticut to join Avant Garde.   Around this time, Steven and Beverly Kitts began having marital problems, which would eventually end in a divorce.  Despite the divorce impending, Rivers' house was band headquarters.  There, the band would hang out with Leaves, work at Domino's Pizza, play Zelda and Metroid on Nintendo, eat at Denny's, play at arcades, and always focused on the music.  There were no alcohol or drugs allowed.
According to Michael Stanton, Rivers was, by this time, a "rock star in the area".  According to him, one of Rivers' favorite pastimes was calling up girls and talking to them "seemingly all night".  "In my impression at the time, he was making himself miserable quite a bit [to write songs]," he said.  Around this time, Rivers parents were finalizing a divorce.
In 1989, Rivers and Avant Garde moved to Los Angeles.  While there, the band played a few big shows and eventually changed their name to Zoom in an attempt to make themselves more marketable and focused.  At the time, Rivers was attending the Guitar Institute, but not attending classes.  He received notice that he would not graduate.  At the time, he was also working at Tower Records in LA.  At Tower, Rivers came in contact with Pat Finn.  Cuomo's time at Tower opened his eyes to a whole new sound of music.  "The Pixies are one of the bands that really blew my mind when I first moved to LA and started to discover cool music," Rivers said.  Rivers also was turned onto Nirvana.  The first song he heard by them was "Sliver", and Cuomo says that when he first heard it he started to dance.
Cuomo also enrolled at LA City College part time.  His interest in music shifted from guitar technique to songwriting.  "Metal seemed kind of dumb, so I consciously repressed it," Rivers said.  "[The genre] didn't seem very relevant anymore so I locked myself away with an acoustic guitar and started writing my own songs."  Also around this time, Rivers' then girlfriend, Lisa, broke up with him.  Rivers friendship with Pat Finn grew.  "Pat was the first really punk guy I ever met.  I totally admired and respected him, how completely nuts he was.  He was always trying to grab my balls or trying to get fired so he could collect unemployment.  He was trying to get the boss to hit him.  He played me a lot of great music, and taught me a lot about cynicism.  How to talk, how to act.  'Cause I was still fresh out of Connecticut, a complete idiot.  And he also introduced me to Matt and Pat."  During the winter of 1990/1991, Rivers, now twenty years old, wrote songs like "You Overpower Me", "Anything for You" and "Xmas in L.A.", which was a musical letter home about being away from home for Christmas.
To work with his new songs, Rivers formed a band called Fuzz with Patrick Wilson and Scottie Chapman.  The band eventually dissolved/fused into 60 Wrong Sausages.  With his life finally looking up again, Rivers was also a 4.0 straight-A student at Los Angeles Communtiy College.  Rivers continued to record his own songs and then took them to whatever project he was pursuing at the time.
Rivers very much enjoyed collaborating with Pat Wilson.  The two would pen songs together such as "The Pop Screen" and "What's Goin' On?" while Rivers wrote his own more somber pieces such as "Sing to Me Slow" and "I Got So Many Problems."  These early songs were the basis of 60 Wrong Sausages.  With 60WS, Cuomo recorded the Cholesterol EP.  He was also helping Kevin Ridel record for his Christian rock band, The Truth.  Cuomo was mostly an engineer and aided backup vocals and guitars where needed on songs such as "My Salvation", "Eyes of the Children" and "I Belong to God".
Rivers rehearsed with 60WS until they played their one and only show on Thanksgiving weekend.  Rivers was slowly losing interest in the band and was more excited in his own material.  Feeling inspired by Pixies and Nirvana, Rivers and Pat set out to collaborate on a 50 song collaborative project.
According to Jason Cropper, Rivers sensed alternative music was about to explode.  It was this belief that guided his new songs like "Why Do We Hurt Each Other?", "I Need Some Touch", "2-2 Tango" and "My Name is Jonas".  Jason also recalled the first time he and Cuomo heard "Smells Like Teen Spirit" at the Italian restaurant where they worked.  After the song finished, Rivers was upset that it was Kurt who had written the song and not himself.  Jason said, "My fondest, pre-Weezer memory is I'm cooking, Rivers is cleaning, and we're both standing in the same kitchen, and that song comes on the radio, in like the first week of its release, and Rivers says, 'I should have written that.'  And I'm like, 'Yeah.  That's totally true.'  Because the music he was writing was improving in quality every day.  Every day he wrote a better song."
Rivers thought it best that the band have a large catalogue of songs before they even began playing.  That way, they wouldn't waste studio time and would be more focused and cohesive when they finally formed.  "I didn't want to get back into a band until I felt like I had a bunch of songs that were good and that had cohesive style", Rivers said.  "So I just wrote songs and didn't play at all for a long time. 'Undone', 'Jonas', 'Only in Dreams' and 'The World Has Turned and Left Me Here' were all written before we even played together."  Pat's enthusiasm for the songs led to them getting in the hands of Matt Sharp.  Matt was so impressed that he came down to Los Angeles to help form Weezer.
On February 14, 1992, a still-unnamed Weezer held their first rehearsal.  The vibe was so strong and positive that they practiced for several days in a row, recording the fourteen songs they played on their third practice.  Cuomo said, "When we first started practicing, I mean from our very first rehearsal, I thought to myself, 'We're amazing.  This is incredible!  Everybody's going to love us!"
Unfortunately, the band did not take off as quickly as Rivers had hoped.  "Nobody would come to our shows for months and months and months," Rivers said, "I mean, we were playing the songs that became big hits..."  Cuomo also said, "We would always be last slot on the bill at 1 A.M. when everyone was leaving.  So we had really low self esteem."  After two do-it-yourself tours, Rivers said, "I remember Matt and I just finally collapsing, like, nine months into the whole thing and just looking at each other and saying, 'We must be crazy.  We must have bad taste.'  Because we thought this was cool and nobody was getting it."
Eventually, Weezer did generate a buzz.  It was enough to capture the attention of a strong LA fanbase and even some label interest.  Todd Sullivan decided to sign Weezer.  Rivers quickly wrote some new songs in a fit of happiness and nervousness.
Following Weezer's success, Rivers was worried that the band was made famous from the gimmicks of the "Buddy Holly" video and not his songwriting.  He removed his glasses because he felt they were also a gimmick.  He began to talk less and took complete control of the band.  He felt somewhat cheated that the rock star life was not like the life Kiss promised him when he was younger.  Beginning to question his rock star life, Rivers wrote the song "Longtime Sunshine" while at home for Christmas in 1994.  In it, he contemplated going to an East cost college, leaving the rock star's "lonely life behind" and confessed he would be satisfied in the simple things.  Rivers also began to outline what he saw as the next Weezer album.  Rivers felt that Weezer was too simple and basic and was intending to go to Harvard to learn classical composition.  This paved the way for Songs from the Black Hole and eventually Pinkerton.
Rivers used the money that success afforded him to have corrective surgery on his leg, which had been shorter than the other since birth.  Rivers found himself wanting a place where he could retreat and become invisible.  He grew a beard, put on his glasses and attended Harvard.
At Harvard, Rivers began to abandon his space opera concept.  A bad case of writers block kept Rivers from writing any material for quite some time.  The only thing Rivers knew was that Weezer's next album should be completely without gimmick.  At Harvard, Rivers was unrecognizable to most.  He walked with a cane, had a thick thick beard, long hair, and thick glasses.  According to Rivers, fans would walk by in Weezer shirts and not recognize him.
Rivers writers block let up when he received a letter from a Japanese fan girl.  The letter would inspire the song "Across the Sea", and help to kill the Black Hole project.  The song's lyrics reveal that the letter meant so much, and he was in such need of attention, that he would lick the envelope where she licked it, and have sexual fantasies about the girl.  Around this time, Rivers was also reading lots of Joe Matt comics, studying classical composition, had a strong interest in Madame Butterfly, and was inspired by the guitar stylings of Yngwie Malsteem.  All of these things played a strong roll in the songs he wrote.  "Across the Sea" featured references to Japanese culture, had chord changes, dynamics and complexity like that of a classical composition, and the guitar was fast and relentless much like Malsteem's.  Furthermore, the idea of holding nothing back and exposing everything is similar to the comics Joe Matt makes such as Spent.  Cuomo would also fall in love with girls at Harvard, most of whom he was terrified of approaching, one of which turned out to be a lesbian.  This prompted the songs "Pink Triangle" and "El Scorcho".  "The Good Life" chronicled the lifestyle of Rivers at Harvard.  Rivers walked with an "old man cane", was "bitter and alone", was looking more bizarre than he ever had ("who's that funky dude?"), etc.  "Falling for You", another song Rivers wrote at Harvard, made reference to the girl he sang about in "El Scorcho".
When it came time to record Weezer's second album Pinkerton, Rivers had taken complete control of the band.  He was less social with his bandmates, he was more reserved, and he wanted no gimmicks.  He wanted Pinkerton to have a raw and rough sound, which he said was closer to Weezer's actual sound.
When Rivers toured for Pinkerton, he had more of a drive to make sure he was having sex with groupies and living the rock star life.  After shows, Rivers would make conversation with girls (typically Asian), and often invite them back to his hotel room to have sex with.  Rivers wrote of this in one of his essays, A Mad and Furious Master.  In it, he writes, "Then one night, I plucked up my courage and boldly proclaimed, “OK, whoever wants to stay in the room has to . . . uhh . . .  take off their clothes and…uhh…get on the bed”.  The women tittered and most of them left, but four of them stayed, and to my amazement, did as I asked."  Several fan accounts of this are chronicled on the website "Rivers el Pervo".
Rivers also made arrangements so that 75% of all video footage in the music videos was of him.  He arranged salaries to members based on contributions to the albums (which left him with a majority of the money).  However, after Pinkerton's commercial disappointment, Rivers was somewhat embarrassed and ashamed of the album he had made.  In 2001, Rivers said, "It’s a hideous record… It was such a hugely painful mistake that happened in front of hundreds of thousands of people and continues to happen on a grander and grander scale and just won’t go away. It’s like getting really drunk at a party and spilling your guts in front of everyone and feeling incredibly great and cathartic about it, and then waking up the next morning and realizing what a complete fool you made of yourself."  After Pinkerton, Rivers sought a less personal writing style and moved to Boston.
With Weezer's future uncertain, Rivers moved back to Boston and dropped out of Harvard.  While there, he pursued many different musical projects, including the short-lived acts Homie and Rivers Cuomo Band.  He also began attempting to write songs for Weezer's third album, however, most of these songs were ultimately not used for the band's third release.
After many shows with Homie, Rivers continued his "songwriting machine", recording more demos than ever before, which eventually led to the reformation of Weezer. With all of his new material, all of Weezer recorded demos and headed right into the Warped tour, and which would eventually lead up to the Summer Songs of 2000 tour (or Ss2K for short). In an interview with Yahoo!, Rivers stated if they weren't on the tour he would "still be in my room wanting to play music."After the tour was over, Rivers had build a new home-studio, which he and the band used to record The Christmas CD (after which Rivers had his braces removed) and what would become The Green Album.
With all his new material and tons of demos recorded, Rivers and all of Weezer headed back into the studio to record The Green Album. Rivers had written over 75 new songs for the album and was as he said a "struggle" to narrow it down to only 20 songs, which would have to be then marked only to 10.
In February 2003, taking the advice of producer Rick Rubin, Rivers became involved in a form of meditation called Vipassana, and later that year, began a vow of celibacy.  His intention was to find balance in his life. He now frequently takes Vipassana 10 day courses every few months.
Cuomo married Kyoko Ito on June 18, 2006, a woman he had known since the fall of 1997. He proposed to her in Tokyo shortly before Christmas of 2005. The wedding was held at a secluded beach on Paradise Cove in Malibu and was attended by over a hundred people, including six of the seven members who played in Weezer (Mikey Welsh being the only no show) as well as notables Justin Fisher, Kevin Ridel and Rick Rubin.  The couple has a daughter, Mia, who was born in May of 2007.
In 2009 in a BBC interview, Rivers said "The older fans – their tastes get frozen in time and they’re not able to evolve with the band. We’ve found again and again through our career that we’ve had to shed some fans like a snake sheds its skin, just so that we can stay vital." This was posted on Allthingsweezer and angered many fans there.
Rivers Cuomo has, in recent years, had a very unique relationship with his fan base.  Beginning in the early Maladroit recording era, Rivers would post on several Weezer fan message boards, including the official Web site board and the "Rivers Correspondence Board" under the name Ace, which was inspired by Ace Frehley of the band Kiss.  Rivers would ask for the fans' advice, treating them as a producer, often exchanging emails through Karl Koch, and eventually posting on boards himself.  Some of the correspondence boardies were even invited backstage during tours to play foosball with him.  Some of the relationships with the fans pushed Cuomo's temper causing him to once refer to them as "little bitches", Cuomo being upset with the fans' demands for an older sounding Weezer rather than letting the band explore new sounds.
As of late, Cuomo has been posting on the official Weezer.com message board under the handle RiversCuomo.
Starting on the Foozer tour in late 2005, Rivers Cuomo would invite fans onto the stage to play Undone - The Sweater Song on acoustic guitar.  After the performance, fans were allowed to keep the guitars they played.
In 2008, coinciding with the release of Weezer's new self titled album, Weezer (The Red Album), Rivers and Weezer announced a Nissan Live Sets performance in which fans were allowed to bring any instrument of their choice and perform in a Hootenanny with the band.
In March 2008 Cuomo started a video series on YouTube called "Let's Write a Sawng."  Through the majority of 2008, Rivers exchanged videos with fans online to write a new song called "Turnin' Turnin'".  The project resulted in the song "Turning Up The Radio," which appeared on the 2010 rarities album Death to False Metal.

                            Drake Bell Interview: From Teen Star to Rockabilly Revivalist                        
=======================================================
The singer/guitarist/songwriter of Weezer, Rivers Cuomo was born June 13, 1970, and grew up in Connecticut. Intrigued by both the sounds of heavy metal (Kiss, Van Halen) and hook-heavy punk-pop (the Pixies), Cuomo moved to Los Angeles in 1989 alongside his bandmates in the progressive metal outfit Avant Garde. The group disbanded one year later, however, and Cuomo dabbled in several other projects before forming Weezer in 1992. The original lineup consisted of Cuomo, guitarist Jason Cropper, bassist Matt Sharp, and drummer Pat Wilson. 
After playing L.A. clubs for over a year, the quartet was signed to Geffen, but Cropper quit abruptly around this time (reappearing later in the '90s with Chopper One). Cropper's replacement was Brian Bell, formerly of Carnival Art, and the revised band recorded their debut at Electric Lady Studios with Ric Ocasek serving as producer. As most Weezer fans know, their 1994 self-titled debut was a smash hit on the strength of the hit singles/videos "Undone (The Sweater Song)," "Buddy Holly," and "Say It Ain't So." The breakup of Nirvana had left a gaping hole in the power pop-punk genre, and Weezer released their debut just at the right time. After the yearlong tour wrapped up, Cuomo retreated from the music world and began studying at Harvard; he also grew a beard to protect his anonymity and had surgery on his leg (when he was born, one leg was shorter than the other), which resulted in Cuomo having to wear a leg brace for some time. 
Weezer returned with the darker Pinkerton in 1996, having scrapped their previous plans to record a space-themed rock opera as their sophomore album. Cuomo wrote the album's ten tracks while studying at Harvard, drawing upon such themes as groupies, fan mail, lesbians, and Japanese women. While the album didn't yield any hit singles, fans treasured it as a stronger release than the band's debut. Nevertheless, Weezer once again went on hiatus following Pinkerton's supportive tour, and bassist Sharp permanently left the lineup to devote more time to his other band, the Rentals (Sharp was later replaced by Bostonian Mikey Welsh). With little news coming from the Weezer camp by the dawn of the 21st century, many assumed the band had broken up. Cuomo gave a few surprise solo shows in Boston during 1999, however, and announced the following year that a third Weezer release was forthcoming. 
The release did not see the light of day until 2001, as Cuomo was waiting for braces to come off his teeth before recording would commence. Known as The Green Album, the record spawned the hit singles "Hash Pipe" and "Island in the Sun." 2002's Maladroit did not fare as well, but Weezer returned to hitmaking status with 2005's Make Believe, which earned the band a Grammy nomination for the song "Beverly Hills." The album's content was partially inspired by Cuomo's discovery of meditation, which he had practiced intensely during the three previous years. Cuomo had also been recording homemade demos since the band's inception in 1992, and he gathered 18 of them for a 2007 solo compilation, Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo. ~ Greg Prato, Rovi

out o' town out o' town     Kyoko and I are going to be at a Vipassana course, unreachable by phone or email, from July 12-23. 
a d a m's Comment: a d a m's Comment:""strutter '78" is a classic example of something that wasn't reworked/re-recorded for any real good reason other than commerce, which in my opinion, is pretty much always the wrong reason.they specifically re-worked it to have a disco feel to be more current and sell more records in the disco era.i remember me and you and justin having a really big "double platinum" era and always skipping that version and moving on to other songs. we always had a real distaste for it, but i will say that i think ace's solos on the new version are pretty good and i listened to "double platinum" so much that when shufflepuck recorded our version of "strutter" for a b-side to our record, the majority of the songs chord structure and patterns were from the version off the 1st kiss record (as well as the live version), but the solos i played were quoting the double platinum version, so yeah....that's wierd.maybe i don't know what i'm talking about."

I was exposed to a ton of music that I otherwise never would have heard. I saw 1991-12-22 Jane's Addiction/Pixies/Primus at the Palladium.  I saw Tool at Rajis out of curiosity.

And it doesnt seem like being on the road or working with a band is going to allow that to happen.  This didnt come out right.  What I meant was that I didnt seem to be able to find a partner while I was working with the band.  This interview was heavily cut and pasted by the editor.****My Trip To Seoul:  http://news.joins.com/en/200512/21/200512212203148731c000c040c041.htmlDuh . . .

(My mom said she wanted me to be able to pick my own middle name.  I never bothered.)When I was about eight, I was given the Hindu first name Rama by Swami Satchidananda.  Most kids who went to the ashram school took Hindu first names at that time. At some point around age ten, I started using my step-fathers last name Kitts (not Kitz). When I switched to public school in sixth grade, I started using the first name Peter because I wanted to fit in.  Most of the ex-ashram kids started using normal names at this point.After graduating high school, when I was eighteen, I started using Rivers Cuomo again because it seemed more rock-star-ish and thats what I wanted to be:  a rock star.Throughout my entire life, my legal name has always been Rivers Cuomo.*****MTV interview: I think it was a little harsh when I said, "There is no God."  What I meant by that is that there is no sectarian belief or faith involved in the meditation:  it's purely a mental exercise.  That's why people come from all different faiths, beliefs, backgrounds, religions, and traditions.  I've seen catholic priests, muslims, jains, buddhist monks, jews, and atheists attend these courses, with no apparent feeling of conflict.I believe there is some confusion about the moral code by which I try to live.  Here are the eight precepts I observe when I am at the meditation center, sitting a course:1. to abstain from killing any living creature;2. to abstain from stealing;3. to abstain from all sexual activity;4. to abstain from telling lies;5. to abstain from all intoxicants.6. to abstain from eating after midday;7. to abstain from sensual entertainment and bodily decoration;8. to abstain from using high or luxurious beds.When I am outside the center, in my daily life, I only observe the first five.  Also, precept number three, outside the center, is modified:  to abstain from all sexual activity outside of a lifelong committed relationship.  (For me, for now, that means total abstinence, because I dont have a partner.)The purpose of the precepts is to make my mind calmer so that I can meditate better.  The purpose of the meditation is to help my singing, songwriting, performing, and just about everything else in my life.  See?   It all makes sense.  :)*****"Cuomo, who studies Buddhism..."I don't study Buddhism, I practice meditation.*****"There are rumors that Cuomo may return to Harvard, where he's majoring in English, to finish his final semester.

So I'll just start with the first time I met Rivers at the Vipassana Center. First, a little Vipassana lingo, there are basically two things a person can do at the center, sit or serve.  Sitting means being a student for the course and just focusing on meditation.  Serving is working for the students(usally about 100) either in the kitchen preparing food, or being a manager, which means attending to any needs of the individual students.  Managers tend to be more experienced students.A year and a half ago, when I met Rivers, I was in the middle of a 6 month sitting and serving period.  I'd left the center for a few days and came back a day or two late to serve a 10 day course.  I met all the other 10 servers except for the manager for the male students because they are usually not in the kitchen but they do stop in to help when they have extra time.  The male manager turned out to be Rivers and I saw him briefly a couple of times and knew he looked familiar but I would never have expected it to be him.  The more I looked at him the more I was saying to myself, 'Damn, that really looks like Rivers Cuomo'.  So we were working in the kitchen across from each other.  He was scrubbing potatoes and I was cutting tofu.  I was thinking, 'Is there any way this can possibly be Rivers?'  I basically convinced myself that it wasn't logical that Rivers would be at this meditation center that I've been coming to for years.  Once I decided it wasn't him I simply asked,"What's your name?"  He said, "Oh, my name is Rivers."  I remember that I involuntarily jerked backwards a little bit in shock.  I am a big Weezer fan and a musician.  I introduced myself and said,"Sorry for my reaction, I just thought you looked really familiar."  Not knowing what else to say I said," Your music is wonderful."  I felt like a dork.  He thanked me and I walked away trying to comprehend how amazing it was that I was meeting one of my idols in such a spiritual and personal environment.  We worked together on the course for the next couple of weeks and slowly I got to know a lot about Rivers.  For the first few days I would be meditating five feet from Rivers with about 20 Weezer songs running through my head.  It was very surreal.  The initial conversations I had with Rivers were mainly about the Dhamma, (the teaching and practice of Vipassana).  I figured he was probably enjoying his autonomy at the center and didn't want to be pestered by a fan, so, while it took some restraint, i tried to keep the rock-related questions to a minimum.  He told me how he'd been very unhappy with his last two records and had been looking for a way to reconnect with his creativity and that Rick Rubin had suggested that he take a meditation course.  He had already attended 4 or 5 courses in about a 6 month period which is way more than usual.  I remember one conversation that stands out, I asked him if he was still friends with Matt Sharp, he looked at me and with a sadness in his voice he said, "I'm trying to be".  He told me how he'd been reaching out to Matt and trying to make peace and resolve whatever tensions there were between them.  It was obvious he was really hurt that they weren't friends.  He seemed willing to do whatever it would take to improve their relationship and I could see that his meditation practice was helping him deal with it.  Rivers was much more comfortable talking about meditation and the teachings of Vipassana than he was talking about music, being a rock star, touring, and all the things that the Weezer fan in me wanted to know about.  A few times we would get on those subjects and he would say, "Wow,I can feel how agitated I'm getting just talking about these things."  One time when we were talking about his new album he just said, "I don't think I want to talk about music right now."  Our conversations also seemed to gravitate toward the subject of women.  Being in a semi-monastical environment really tends to bring up the passions in a person.  Rivers seemed very preoccupied with girls and the idea of finding the right partner who would also be into meditation.  Rivers is a very shy and private person.  I remember our other friend Travis and I talked to him a lot about meeting women and interacting with them.  In the 7 years that I have been practicing Vipassana I have met very few people  who are as dedicated to the practice as Rivers.  For example, most people starting off take 10 day courses which are very demanding.  If you practice 2 hours minimum a day for 2 years and refrain from using any intoxicants during that time, as well as meeta few other requirements,  you can qualify to take a 20 day course.  Very few people take these longer courses.  Rivers just completed a 20 day course after a little less than 2 years of practicing!  Imagine 20 days of total silence, meditating 10 to 12 hours a day!  You can understand the kind of dedication that this would take.  Rivers always seems down to meditate.  The few times I visited him in LA thats what we did.  He has clearly cultivated a lot of inner peace and clarity through his practice.  Also sitting still and meditating for hours on end can be very uncomfortable.  You tend to want to fidget. When Rivers sits to meditatite he resembles a stone statue of the Buddha. no movement.  He is a person that exudes discipline.  It's very inspirational.  I remember between courses a few of us were going up to nearby Yosemite Park to camp out and have a little mens circle.  Rivers really wanted to come with us but he waffled back and forth for about an hour because he didn't want to leave the vibe of the meditation center and risk loosing his focus, as we were going to be sitting a 10-day course starting the next day.  Eventually he decided not to come, I really admired his discipline. <>  One funny thing that I recall was after a course Rivers got picked up in a big black chauferred van equipped with a guitar and he was excited about the four hour ride home, getting to pour all of his newly cultivated inspiration into writing new songs.  I think we'll get to hear some of that on the new album."  ---Matt Herman

Letter For Readmission To Harvard--2005 Tuesday, December 13, 2005 Letter For Readmission To Harvard--2005Dear Dr. ****,This letter is to inform you of my intention to return to Harvard next semester and to fill you in on what I’ve been up to since I left.After final exams in January, I went to Los Angeles to finish Weezer’s fifth album, Make Believe, which debuted on May 10 at number 2 on the Billboard album chart, our highest position ever, and which was just certified platinum.  The first single, “Beverly Hills”, went to number 4 on the pop singles chart, making it our biggest hit ever by far.  The current single, “Perfect Situation”, and its video, are doing well also.  The album received mixed reviews but I believe it is one of our best.Since Make Believe was released, Weezer performed with many other top artists including an extended tour with the Foo Fighters and one-off gigs with some of my biggest influences, Oasis and Public Enemy.  We toured all over Europe, America, and Japan and broke new ground in Brazil and Mexico.  We worked purposefully to improve our show and I worked especially hard to improve myself as a front-man.  Almost all fan reports and critical reviews expressed surprise at the improvement in our show. We did a lot of publicity, including a cover story for Rolling Stone magazine and performances on The Howard Stern Show, Late Night With David Letterman, The Tonight Show With Jay Leno, and The Jimmy Kimmel Show.We made two of our best videos, I think, for the singles “We Are All On Drugs” and “Perfect Situation”.  We took these projects as artistic challenges and worked really hard.  I pushed myself particularly in the domain of acting—which I’d completely shied away from since childhood. Throughout the year, I downloaded the most popular songs on the Billboard Hot 100 and listened to them on shuffle as I ran on the treadmill.  Similarly, I read many of the bestselling books, both fiction and non-fiction, including Ron Chernow’s biography of Alexander Hamilton, Azar Nafisi’s Reading Lolita In Tehran, Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart, Levitt and Dubner’s Freakonomics, and Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code.  I read Newsweek magazine fairly regularly.  I got a better sense of the medium in which my work exists, where I want to fit in, and where I don’t. I kept a web-log that which received about 700,000 page views.  I wrote articles for Ellegirl and Jane magazines, one called “My Apartment” and the other about my trip to Asia.  I view my literary efforts as just another means of being creative and hopefully spreading a positive influence.I traveled to India to visit my meditation teacher S.N. Goenka and to Myanmar to see the sites related to our tradition.  Unfortunately, I couldn’t meet with Mr. Goenka because of his sudden ill health, but I still received tremendous inspiration from visiting the home Vipassana center and meeting so many other serious meditators.  The trip was documented for possible inclusion in a film. I attended several Vipassana meditation courses around the country including the 20-day course in March in Massachusetts.  I also studied the Buddha’s discourses and other critical and historical texts related to the Buddha’s life and teaching. I got closer to my parents, uncovering within myself a sense of responsibility for and connection with them.  My mother is now a Vipassana meditator too and I am enjoying the feeling of security and support that comes with having multiple generations within a family walking on the same spiritual path.  My father saw me perform this year for the first time and we are getting to know each other after not having much contact while I was growing up.  I appreciate the sudden fatherly influence in my life and am surprised at how much we have in common.I am looking forward to coming back to Harvard in the spring and finishing what I started back in 1995.  My motivation is much different now than it was then:  then I was terribly discontent and dreaming of being a classical composer, a writer, or basically anything that I wasn’t; now I just want to enjoy my life and do the responsible thing—graduate.Take care.  I will see you soon.Sincerely,Rivers(2005-07-05)[revised and edited]Here's the 2004 letter again: What I’ve Been Up To Since I Left SchoolWeird ScienceAfter the initial failure of my band’s second album, Pinkerton, I decided not to return to school in the fall of 1997, instead setting out on a mission to develop creative methods which would allow me to be more consistent as an artist.  Above all, I wanted to cure myself of the Romanticism which I believed was to blame for my failure.Throughout 1998 and 1999 I engaged in hundreds of song-experiments.  I filled notebooks and cassette tapes.  I drew graphs, tables, and charts.  I studied other songwriters’ methods.  I took hundreds of pages of notes on the creative process, mostly from Nietzsche, but also from Goethe and Stravinsky. At first, I maintained a relatively normal social life, playing and coaching soccer and continuing my classical piano studies with Bruce Sutherland.  Eventually, however, I became more and more isolated.  I unplugged my phone.  I painted the walls and ceiling of my bedroom black and covered the windows with fiberglass insulation.  I disciplined myself to the extreme.   My goal was to purge myself of all weakness so that I could write “perfect” songs as reliably as a machine. Most of the time, I believed that I was optimistic and happy.  The song-experiments, however, produced music of less and less joy and, occasionally, I would fall into despair.  At one point, in September of 1999, I actually gave up my mission and decided to go back to school, sacrificing my music career indefinitely.  I contacted Dean Thomas Dingman to gain admission, but learned that I had missed the registration deadline by two weeks.  I could only move forward with the music.I struggled on for two-and-a-half years in all.  I finally concluded that such intense focus on musical perfection was only scaring off any real inspiration I might have had.  I decided I needed to broaden my focus onto a more practical, tangible goal, in the hopes that the music would start to flow in service to that goal.   I read in Nietzsche that “great” men like Julius Caesar, Cesare Borgia, and Napoleon found their genius through practical activity, on the battlefield, in the pursuit of worldly ambitions.  They were not locked away in a study like me.  I decided to follow the example of these men, step onto the battlefield, and pursue “World domination”.  I hoped this goal would spark my creativity.  . World domination—or, in terms applicable to me, commercial success—meant making the most of what I had, musically, and becoming active with my band again, and making an album and touring.  I swallowed my creative insecurities for the sake of that success and revealed my songs to close associates in early 2000.  Their positive reactions led to rehearsals, which led to performances.  We discovered that during our long absence, we had only become more popular.  Our “failed” album, Pinkerton, was now viewed by many critics and fans as great.  With momentum behind me, I kept writing.  At the end of 2000, we entered the studio to make our long overdue third album.Imperial AspirationsThe Green Album was released in May of 2001, going on to sell over two million copies worldwide.  We toured extensively, playing our biggest concerts ever.  We performed on Saturday Night Live and at the MTV Movie Awards.  The album’s success at radio and MTV, and in foreign markets wherein we had had no previous success, seemed to me to validate the approach I had taken with myself and my art.  I quickly became the opposite of the unconfident hermit I had been in 1998 and 1999.  I now believed that my band would become “the biggest band in the world” and that I was the man to lead us to that destiny. I sought to cultivate the same ruthless practicality in my business that I had achieved in my music.  I studied the lives of Napoleon and David Geffen, Machiavelli’s “The Prince”, and contemporary texts on leadership and management.  I gradually took over all of the business responsibilities from our manager and managed the band completely by myself.  My performing, writing, and recording continued but were now joined by my business activities, all of which together I viewed as converging on the one goal of “world domination”.  I read books on business and negotiating.  I hired a staff.  I reformed our operation, renegotiated contracts, and consolidated power.  I found it easy to gain ground in negotiations because no music businesspeople wanted to “play hardball” with “the artist”.  Furthermore, I believed we were able to grow with integrity, as I could now make informed choices, seeing for once exactly how the business worked.However, I also steered us into many bitter battles, including two lawsuits and many other very tense negotiations.  For example, in order to demonstrate our independence from the record company in the new age of digital media, I shut them out of the making of our fourth album, Maladroit.  We financed and produced the album entirely ourselves, sending hundreds of copies of the finished product to press and radio—but none to our record company.  The record company could only watch on the sidelines as the single quickly climbed the charts, and the fans downloaded the promotional copies off the internet.  At this point, we had what I believed was optimal leverage, and we renegotiated our contract. Ultimately, however, Maladroit was not the big hit that it had threatened to be, selling only about three-quarters of a million copies.  I had succeeded in improving our financial arrangement, but not in making a hit album.  The record company blamed my shenanigans for the downturn in our success. Many fans also criticized the music.  They heard both Maladroit and The Green Album as being “mechanical” and “emotionless”.  I tried to evaluate the criticism objectively but I made little progress.  I had extinguished my faculty of self-criticism in 1998-2000 in order to make the comeback.  Now I could not tell if my current predicament was just a classic case of an audience lagging behind the development of an artist (as in the case of Bob Dylan when he went electric) or if I had I really “lost something”.  I reacted defensively, calling the fans “little bitches” in an interview with Guitar World magazine.  Now the fans were unhappy, the record company was unhappy, my associates were unhappy, and I was unhappy.  I did not know what could be done to change that.I fell further into ego and vice.  Still, deep inside, I was having serious doubts.  I asked myself, “Is my life really supporting the production of the kind of music I know I am capable of?”  I had to admit that my music no longer gave me the feeling of sublime ecstasy that it once had.  Although I had already written another large pile of songs for our fifth album, I put all plans to record on hold.  There was a revolution brewing in my unconscious, soon to be triggered by the man we had hired a few months earlier to produce the album, Rick Rubin.  RenunciationIn February of 2003, Rick gave me a copy of Daniel Ladinsky’s translation of Hafiz’s poetry, The Gift.  After overcoming my initial aversion to all things spiritual, I decided to read some of the book because I trusted Rick so much.  Henry Mindlin, in his introduction to the book, says:Hafiz wrote hundreds of ghazals [or love songs], finding ways to bring new depth and meaning to the lyrics without losing the accustomed association of a love song…He explored different forms and levels of love:  his delight in nature’s beauty, his romantic courtship of that ideal unattainable girl, his sweet affection for his wife, his tender feelings for his child…his relationship with his teacher and his adoration of God.I was struck by the connection between all these different forms of love.  I recognized that the feeling of sublime ecstasy I once got from music was just one more of these forms of love. I had an epiphany:  if the feeling these mystics get in union with their God is analogous to the feeling I used to get in union with my music, then their teachings for how to achieve their union should likewise serve to instruct me how to achieve my union.  A whole world of spiritual teachings therefore opened up to me for the first time since, as a child, I had decided that I was an “atheist”.  I now read these spiritual teachings as coded instructions for how to connect with my musical creativity.  For example, when Hafiz says, “Self-Effacement is the emerald dagger you need to plunge deep into yourself upon this path to …God”, I read it as “Self-Effacement is the emerald dagger you need to plunge deep into yourself upon this path to Musical Creativity.”  Like this, I just replaced the word God wherever I saw it.   I had discovered a new path which I believed was what I had been waiting for.  I eagerly studied a wide variety of traditions including the mystical poetry of Hafiz, Rumi, and Kabir, contemporary spiritual teachers, and ancient texts such as the Tao Te Ching.  In accord with my understanding of these teachings, I abruptly dropped all of my business responsibilities and hard-won power, and isolated myself once again.  I fasted and lost fifteen percent of my weight.  I took a vow of complete celibacy.  I gave away or sold most of my possessions, my house, and my car and lived in an empty apartment next to Rick’s house for the rest of the year.  I settled outstanding lawsuits and reconciled myself with enemies.  I apologized to many people.   I volunteered six days a week at Project Angel Food in Hollywood, preparing meals for people with HIV. BalanceThus, my life made another extreme swing, as it has many times since I was a teenager.  I have been sometimes a tyrant, sometimes the most frustratingly passive person you have ever met, sometimes a socialite, sometimes a hermit, sometimes a rock star, sometimes a student.  I have had little inner stability.During this latest swing towards spirituality, however, I started a practice which may help me achieve some balance:  meditation.  Rick Rubin sent me some books on the subject but, at first, I would not read them.  I thought that meditation would rob me of the angst that I believed was essential for my connection to music.  All the crazy experiments I have tried in my life have always been an effort to improve, maintain, or recover that connection.   Eventually, however, desperate for answers, I read the first three chapters of one of the books, Ken Mcleod’s guide to meditation, Wake Up to Your Life.   His words hit me like a lightning bolt.  I realized that, in a sense, I had been wrong all these years in trying to connect to my creativity by violent means, for example, by mining my adolescent anger for “Say it Ain’t So”, crucifying my leg for Pinkerton, or consuming Tequila and Ritalin for “Hash Pipe”.  Mcleod says:These devices [such as the ones above] do not work in the long run because they draw on our system’s energy to generate a peak experience.  Peak experiences cannot be maintained, and when they pass, the habituated patterns and the underlying sense of separation remain intact. (xi)Mcleod, and other sources I began reading, showed me a new way to work.  Instead of generating peak experiences for inspiration, I could strengthen my power of concentration through meditation so that I could get more and more inspiration from weaker and weaker experiences.  Not only that, but the practice would make my life better, and make better the lives of those that have to live with me.  I started to meditate. The technique I was drawn to is called Vipassana.  It is taught around the world at over one hundred centers and temporary camps.  (Go to www.dhamma.org for more information.)  I started the practice fourteen months ago, attending seven ten-day courses and serving as a volunteer at two.  Since then, I have found that the areas of tension in my mind—the fear, the anger, the sadness, the craving—are slowly melting away.  I am left with a more pristine mind, more sharp and sensitive than I previously imagined possible.  I feel more calm and stable.  My concentration and capacity to work have increased greatly.  I feel like I am finally much closer to reaching my potential. I now live in a small but comfortable apartment.  I feed myself adequately.  I took a class at USC this spring, “The History of Literary Criticism”, and enjoyed it very much.  I take private lessons in music composition once a week from Bruce Reich, a professor at UCLA.  I still volunteer, once a week, now at the West Hollywood Food Coalition, feeding homeless or otherwise disadvantaged people.  But most pleasing to me is that, month by month, I have watched my creative flexibility returning.  The music I have created over the last six months has brought me much enjoyment. I am returning to Harvard in the fall.  Other than that, I am wide open to whatever else comes my way… 
 Tuesday, November 29, 2005 ...i am currently in myanmar where use of my cell phone and all of my email accounts is blocked by the government.  i'll be in a free nation again on dec. 6.I can't check my messages on Myspace either.  I'm surprised I can blog. 
Level Up Wednesday, November 09, 2005 Level UpPeople.  There’s not much more time left.  I’m heading out to the center tomorrow or the next day and there I’ll have no internet access.  The course starts in three days.I wanted to write a few words of good wishes to everyone.  I’m sorry I haven’t been blogging lately; I’ve been working on a big article for Jane magazine and another essay for re-re-admission to Harvard.  I’m having fun.Thanks for being such great fans and friends, advisors and teachers, coaches and cheerleaders. Good wishes also to my family and my work colleagues; and good wishes to my band.I’m going into a cell for fifteen days of Vipassana.  I intend to face as much of my sadness, anger, fear, and craving as I can and come out a happier person.I’ll see you on the other side!Peace and love,Rivers 
Middle Ground Tuesday, November 08, 2005Middle GroundI’ve been getting an inordinate amount of advice from eighteen year-olds on my love life.My dad seems to understand my situation.  He says he went through a similar process in finding his wife about twenty-five years ago.  His first commitment was to God and his religion.  He was celibate for several years.  He became clear on what he was looking for in a partner.  He met Lila.  He “dispassionately” analyzed the situation.  He didn’t “fall in love” and he didn’t “see stars”.   There never was a “sudden thunderstorm”.  He calmly concluded that they would make a great team.  Over the years, true love seeped in like “dew, deep into the ground.”K’s mom on the other hand is a little concerned by my lack of passion.  She advised K:  “Well, tell him you won’t get married unless he asks YOU to marry him!”  She suspects that I don’t care to whom in particular I get married.Jen Wilson was a little concerned too.  “You might be selling yourself short if you settle for a relationship without that passion.  You need—”Pat interrupted her suddenly. “Now, the world don't move to the beat of just one drum,What might be right for you, may not be right for some.”   He was singing and making hand motions to illustrate the lyrics. “I’m serious,” continued Jen.  “You deserve—” ”Diff'rent Strokes.It takes, Diff'rent Strokes.It takes, Diff'rent Strokes to move the world.”Pat’s point, I think, is that everyone is different and maybe the relationship that’s right for me is different from the stereotypical romantic relationship.Scott agreed when I asked him.“Everybody’s different, bro’.  Everybody needs different things.” That was especially reassuring coming from him because I know how glad he is that he waited to find the right person.I really think K is the right person.  And she was right here all along.  I just needed to grow up.We narrowly avoided disaster last night.  She copied me on an email she sent to Stuart about our December visit requesting that she be put into economy class while it was OK for me to be in First.  I was flabbergasted.  I had thought we were going to be a team.  Equals.  How could she be OK with flying Third class to my First?  I took it as a sign that she didn’t want to incur the commitment that would come with allowing me to pay so much money for her.  I skyped her immediately.  She said I had misunderstood her.  She wasn’t afraid of commitment but just couldn’t bring herself to spend so much of anyone’s money on a single flight. “My dad just bought a car for that amount!”We both agreed to fly Business. I hope we can make these decisions as a team in the future.I want a partner. Not a housekeeper.

Touché Thursday, October 27, 20059:52 AM  	TouchéI think I pulled one of my gluteus maximi last night.I don’t know why I have the reputation for being the systematic thinker:  I think it’s Brian.  He came up with a brilliant scheme for solving the cover song conundrum (you know, the fact that four guys can never agree on one song to cover.)  We each selected two songs and put them in a hat.  Each day we draw a song and have to learn it and play it at sound check.  Yesterday we did Gary Newman’s “Are Friends Electric?” for Pat and today we’re doing “I Don’t Know How to Love Her” from Jesus Christ Superstar for me.  Everyone’s happy.And this boy has notebooks, too.  Yesterday we got in an argument because both of us thought we were supposed to learn the keyboard part.  I had filled a page of my Mead book with notes.“See, I did all this work!”“Pshhh . . . Look at this!”Bri pulled out some fancy French notebook with graph lines on the pages and leaf after leaf of notes on all the different keyboard parts of the song.  The lyrics were printed out, cut, and carefully pasted around the notes he had drawn.“Hmph. . . I guess you can play the keyboard if you want.”He ended up letting me play the keyboard anyway.We call him the “MD” sometimes, or “musical director”.  He’s the one who always seems to have his act together the most and he’s always shouting out the changes to us so we don’t get lost.We are anticipating all out war on the last night of the Foos tour.  Apparently they dropped 50,000 ping pong balls on the Chili Peppers. “Yet, if she said she loved meI'd be lost; I'd be frightenedI couldn't copeJust couldn't copeI'd turn my headI'd back awayI wouldn't want to knowShe scares me soI want her soI love her so...” 
Nuts Wednesday, October 26, 2005NutsPat Finn was there tonight.  He played Undone with us.  That would have been a perfect opportunity to tell a story on stage.Pat Finn was the guy who introduced me to Pat and Matt, and the guy that introduced them to each other.I was working at Tower Records on Sunset Boulevard in 1990-1991.  One day a skin-head looking punk came in to start his first day of work.  It was Pat Finn.  I thought he was the coolest thing ever.  A real punk.At the end of his shift he inexplicably said “Hey man, do you want my peanut butter and banana sandwich?”Food was at a premium at the time for me.“Sure.  Thanks!”A real punk not only talked to me but gave me his sandwich. I idolized him.  He was always trying to get our boss to punch him so he could file for unemployment or sue or something.  He also always tried to grab my nuts forcefully.  I didn’t know if he was gay or just insane but I thought he was the coolest.  I tried to get him in my horrible metal band to be a DJ of all things.  For some reason he was interested in playing music with me too but on HIS terms.One day he said, “You’ve got to meet my friend Winky Smiles.”I went over to his apartment on Gordon and saw first thing as I entered a large grown man lying in a heaping pile of filth and garbage.  He looked up.“Hey Man.”  It was Pat Wilson.“Hey.”They played me Morrissey songs and I tried my best to understand why it was cool because I knew that it was but I couldn’t.  Everything they played me had clean jangly guitars and that just didn’t jibe with my heavy metal background.“This is great stuff,” I said.  I knew I had to latch on to Pat Finn.We eventually formed a band, Sixty Wrong Sausages.  Jason Cropper was in the band too.  We all wrote and took turns singing.  Four-tracking was on in full force.Pat Finn also joined Kyokushin with me.  He was gangly at first but he came to kick some serious ass eventually because of his incredible determination. He was one really intense guy, kind of like me.  He was a vegetarian, a conspiracy theorist, a punk.  He told me about a musical duo he had formed back in Buffalo called “Skraper”.  The other member was apparently a Teutonic titan who rapped a violent breed of nonsense.  I had a pretty scary image in my mind and was surprised eventually when I met the guy, a complete lamb of soul, when he helped me move into my apartment with Pat and Matt.  I’m talking about Karl.Pat Finn was the nexus between all of us, Pat, Matt, Karl, me, the guys in Wax, the guys in the Dum Dums.It was cool to play with him tonight. He’s married and his wife has a nine-year-old (?) by a previous marriage.  The girl goes to a “Waldorf” school.  I want to find a special school for my kids too.  I want them to practice meditation every day like we did in the Yoga School. I called K again this morning.  I pointed out to her that our last show is in Vegas in a few days.  She could meet me there. Vegas.  You get what I’m saying? She said I’m crazy.I AM crazy. 
Dog-Eat-Dog World Tuesday, October 25, 2005 Dog-Eat-Dog World“If I don’t get pit action,” said Dave Grohl, pointing to the dark wet circles under his arms, “the whole first part of my show is ruined.”  He was jumping up and down, flailing his arms like a severely retarded cheerleader.I had snuck into the Foos dressing room to pilfer an orange soda only to discover that they hadn’t left for the stage yet.  They were still in the midst of their warm-up routine, blasting Slayer and bouncing around the room.I pick Dave’s brain whenever I can about frontman techniques:  he’s seriously one of the best I’ve ever seen and I’m obviously one of the worst.I’ve gotten a lot better over this tour though. Now if only I could learn how to talk onstage.  That’ll be my next question for Dave.Bruce Reich was at the show last night, the composition professor from UCLA who gave Brian and me quite a few lessons.  He seemed very impressed.  Lindsay, Rick Rubin’s assistant, was there too.  Jordan was there.  Todd Sullivan was there.  My friend Adam was there. Adam said it was weird to see me singing without a guitar.  It sure is fun for me, though.  Don’t Let Go has been a total blast.  I can’t believe how much better that song has gotten.  Jordan said he found the perfect woman for me. “After all the help you gave me with my relationship I’m going to turn things around now and hook you up.” “. . . “ “What?” “Well, I’ve been talking to K recently.” “Rivers, you don’t understand.  This girl is so hot!” Figures.  Recently there’s been a spate of opportunities, like the women grabbing me in the crowd.  Two nights ago Brian saw a woman flash me from the stands, jiggling herself as I walked over to the side of the stage.  I didn’t even see her.So now the whole world knows that we pilfer things from the Foos room from time to time.Yesterday we found a large bag of Famous Amos cookies sitting on the table in our dressing room.“That must be a joke from the Foos,” said Pat with a guilty look on his face.“How so?”“I’ve been eating their cookies every day and I guess they finally decided to just give me the whole bag.” 
Slip Slidin' Away Tuesday, October 18, 2005Slip Slidin' Away Things seem to be moving forward with K, ineluctably.  Boy would it be strange to have someone around all the time.  “How could I do this if she were here right now,” I thought today as I was working on a song.  The hotel rooms are so small and I’ve always needed total privacy to work on music.  And she’s always watching TV.  Actually, maybe that would work.  Maybe the sound of the TV would cover my creative mumblings so I could feel secure.  Ahh, it’s stupid to worry about it.  I’m sure everything will work out.  It’s all so exciting.  What an adventure.She wants to have kids, three of them, and “as soon as possible”.“Are you sure you want three?”“Well, maybe one kid and then a pair of twins”.She also said she’d be OK with taking them on the road.I had a good talk with an old friend about K last night.  He is the ultimate jade when it comes to relationships, as I have been historically too.  “What’s going to happen when you become attracted to someone else?”“What’s going to happen when she falls in love with someone else?”“Do you really think that two intelligent, dynamic people can be together for life?”He described one of his long-term relationships as like “dragging a piece of furniture around” wherever he went.I totally sympathize with the guy.Yet I’m still moving forward.  This thing just seems to have a gravity that I can’t escape, nor do I feel particularly inclined to escape it.  All my fears about commitment are slowly dissolving.  Perhaps that’s one of the benefits of getting older.  Even if you make a decision that ruins the rest of your life, it’s only half of your life that you’re ruining.  Screw it.The thing about K too is that I already feel committed to her.  I know no promises have been made but somewhere over the course of knowing her these last eight years I just became bonded to her on a very deep level, deeper than the level of conscious vows.  It would feel strange to break that bond and start up with someone else at this point.  Actually, I want whatever’s best for the both of us, whatever’s most natural.  If she finds someone where she is, and she’s happy with him, then I’m happy for her.  At that point, I would have no qualms about moving on and starting anew.  I think.Plan B would definitely be to find someone at school, though I have very little faith in that method, or in the meditation community back east starting next summer.  School didn’t work out too well last semester, as far as mate-finding goes, because the women are just so young and so not into the idea of getting hitched up.  I don’t blame them.  They’ve got three-quarters of their lives ahead of them and tons of ambition.  Who like that would want to be a rock star wife?  There was just no magic there between me and them.The meditation community is much more promising.  I could find someone closer to my age and we would definitely share the most important thing to me, the meditation teaching and helping others come in contact with it and benefit from it.  And she would also most likely live back east near my parents.  Maybe her parents would live there too.I feel like if I can get my family thing squared away, I can make a stronger commitment to the band.  Without that missing piece of the puzzle, I just don’t want to go back on the road again for another cycle of shows, interviews, videos, photo shoots, and lonely hotel rooms.  Those guys all have their women folk and are well on their way to starting their families, to the extent that they want them.  I’ve got nothing.  And NO, I can’t find someone on the road, if that’s what you’re thinking.  I can’t find someone in the world of rock.  It would have happened by now if that was possible.  I’ve got to settle down and be stable, live in one place for a while.  Then things will fall into place naturally.Whether it’s Plan A or Plan B it’s going to happen.Or not.
