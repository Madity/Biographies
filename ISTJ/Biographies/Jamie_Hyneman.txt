James Franklin "Jamie" Hyneman (born September 25, 1956)[1] is an American special effects expert and the co-host of the television series MythBusters alongside Adam Savage. He is also the owner of M5 Industries, the special effects workshop where MythBusters is filmed. He is known among Robot Wars devotees for his robot entry, Blendo, which, for a time, was deemed too dangerous for entry in the competition. He is one of the designers of the aerial robotic camera system Wavecam, used in sports and entertainment events.[2]
Hyneman was born in Marshall, Michigan and raised in Columbus, Indiana. Describing his early life, Hyneman said "I was a problematic kid, to be sure. I left home when I was 14 and hitchhiked all over the country."[3]
He earned a degree in Russian linguistics from Indiana University.[4] He also received an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from Villanova University.[5][6] On November 25, 2011, Hyneman was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Twente (Enschede, Netherlands) for his role in the popularization of science and technology.[7]
A variety of careers fill his resume, including certified dive master, wilderness survival expert, boat captain, linguist, pet shop owner, animal wrangler, machinist, concrete inspector, and chef. He apparently has a mild case of acrophobia (fear of heights), as mentioned in the "Hammer Drop" and "Duct Tape Bridge" episodes of Mythbusters.[citation needed]
Much of the experience Hyneman uses on Mythbusters comes from his time in the visual and special effects professions. Hyneman first broke into the effects industry in the late 80s as an uncredited special effects crew member on Top Gun. From there, Hyneman spent times as an animatronics technician for films such as Naked Lunch and Flubber, as well as work on the second and third installment of the Matrix Trilogy.[8]
His notable achievements in commercials include the can-spitting vending machine seen in 7 Up commercials, and his patented two-wheeled football shoe from Nike Lab commercials.[9]
Hyneman and a Blue Angels team member at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma prepare for the Sonic Boom Sound-off episode in 2009.
A distinctive part of his appearance is his dark beret, white long-sleeve button-up shirt over a black t-shirt, no-rim glasses, and occasionally, mirrored sunglasses with side anti-glare guards. This, along with his walrus-style mustache and deep voice, are constant subjects for jokes by co-host Adam Savage and other team members. A sign hanging in his workshop reading "Clean Up or Die", visible in several episodes, expresses his desire to keep the shop clean and tidy.
Hyneman's demeanor on MythBusters is calm, logical and no-nonsense, in stark contrast to Savage's more animated, impulsive and energetic persona.[10] Hyneman is often exasperated by Savage's antics and he sometimes argues with him about the best approach to take. The two often have very different ideas for performing experiments and building devices. Hyneman's ideas tend to be more simplified than his co-host's, and he has a philosophy of reducing a solution to its most basic form, wherever possible. This difference has led to numerous competitions between the two presenters when testing myths, such as testing the Goldfish Memory myth and Hoverboard myth.
In the "AC on vs. Windows Down" myth, Hyneman revealed a food that he invented (and commonly eats) known as "the 444", a smoothie-like concoction of four fruit, four vegetable, and four grain servings. Despite skepticism by the rest of the crew, Hyneman described the 444's taste as "quite pleasant".
The two army-junk sellers in The Darwin Awards are portrayed by Savage and Hyneman. They appear during the story of the rocket-car, which they partially reproduced in the Mythbusters series' pilot episode and have retested two more times.[11]
On May 16, 2010, Hyneman delivered the commencement address and received an honorary Doctorate of Engineering, from Villanova University.[13] Hyneman has been dr.h.c. Jamie Hyneman since November 25, 2011 when he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Twente on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. He was awarded his honorary doctorate together with Adam Savage for their work in popularizing science.[14]
Hyneman made a cameo appearance along with Savage on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation on the May 1, 2008 episode "The Theory of Everything",[15] where they play inspectors each giving thumbs-up after seeing a shirt soaked in pepper spray catch fire when shot by a taser. They went on to test this myth on Mythbusters and declare it confirmed with certain types of pepper spray.
He and MythBusters co-host Savage appear as judges on the game show Unchained Reaction, which premiered in March 2012.[16]
Hyneman and Savage have also voiced characters on The Simpsons episode "The Daughter Also Rises" as a parody of themselves, the "MythCrackers", which prompts Bart and Milhouse to experiment in a similar fashion.
Hyneman is currently an editor and contributor at Tested.com alongside fellow Mythbuster Adam Savage, and longtime technology reviewers Will Smith and Norman Chan.
In 1984, Hyneman met his wife, Eileen Walsh—a science teacher—while he owned a sailboat diving charter business in the Virgin Islands.[17][18] Hyneman identifies strongly with skeptics and atheists.[19][20]

Adam Whitney Savage (born July 15, 1967)[2] is an American industrial design and special effects designer/fabricator, actor, educator, and one of two co-hosts of the Discovery Channel television series MythBusters and Unchained Reaction.[1] His model work has appeared in major films, including Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones and The Matrix Reloaded. He is a prominent member of the skeptic community. He lives in San Francisco with his twin sons and wife, Julia.
Born in New York City, Savage was raised in Sleepy Hollow in Westchester County, New York.[3] He graduated from Sleepy Hollow High School in 1985.[4] His father, Whitney Lee Savage (1928–1998), was a painter, filmmaker and animator known for his work on Sesame Street, and has a permanent exhibit in the Avampato Discovery Museum.[5] His mother is a psychotherapist. His sister Kate Savage is also an artist. As a teenager in Sleepy Hollow, he routinely visited the local bike shop to have flat tires fixed. The shop showed him how to do the repairs himself. From this experience, Savage said, "I realized you could take a bike apart and put it back together and it wasn't that hard...I've been building and putting bicycles together since then."[4]
Adam Savage began acting as a child, and has had five years of acting school.[1] His early credits include voicing animated characters that his father produced for Sesame Street, Mr. Whipple's stock boy "Jimmy" in a Charmin commercial, a helper in the special effects of Star Wars, and a drowning young man saved by a lifeguard in the 1985 Billy Joel music video "You're Only Human (Second Wind)".[6]
Describing the early abandonment of his acting career, Savage said that "by the time I was, I guess probably nineteen, I had passed on that in favor of doing stuff with my hands – graphic design, assistant animation in New York, and then eventually working in theater in San Francisco, and film special effects. Then MythBusters came along and it was the perfect marriage of two things, performance and special effects."[7] On November 25, 2011, Savage received an honorary doctorate from the University of Twente (Enschede, Netherlands) for his role in the popularization of science and technology.[8][9]
Savage has worked as an animator, graphic designer, carpenter, projectionist, film developer, television presenter, set designer, toy designer, and gallery owner. He worked as a model maker on the films Galaxy Quest, Bicentennial Man, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, The Matrix Reloaded, and Space Cowboys, among others.
Savage played the role of a helpful engineer in the 2001 film Ever Since the World Ended[10] and the role of an army surplus store owner who sells a man a rocket engine for his pickup truck in 2006 in The Darwin Awards, which also featured MythBusters co-star Jamie Hyneman.[11] He made a cameo appearance along with Jamie Hyneman on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation on the May 1, 2008, episode "The Theory of Everything." In the "making of" material for The Matrix Revolutions, he appears in his role as a special effects artist and discusses some of the miniature effects used and the difficulties involved.
He previously taught advanced model making in the department of Industrial Design at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco.[1]
Savage has become a regular presenter at magician James Randi's annual skeptics' conference, The Amaz!ng Meeting, since first appearing in January 2006.[12] He also appeared in the UK, giving a talk at the first Amazing Meeting London from October 3–4, 2009, hosted at the Mermaid Conference Centre, Blackfriars.[13]
Savage was a featured performer at the three w00tstock v1.x shows in 2009, and appeared in four w00tstock v2.x shows in 2010. He also appeared as a guest on Diggnation's 220th show.[14]
Savage has also been a regular guest speaker at the annual Maker Faire since 2008, speaking on different topics such as his obsession with the dodo bird and problem solving, and also taking questions from the audience members about the Mythbusters and other things.
Savage hosted an episode of the Discovery Channel series Curiosity, in which he speculated as to whether or not it is possible for humans to live forever. During the program various topics such as limb regeneration, organ printers, and even age reversal are discussed.
In 2011, Adam Savage appeared as Dan in a short film directed by Frank Ippolito entitled Night of the Little Dead.[15]
Savage is an occasional guest host for lecture events at the San Francisco-based non-profit City Arts & Lectures.,[17] and delivered the keynote address at South by Southwest (SXSW) Interactive Festival on March 10, 2014.[18]
Savage has been involved in MythBusters since its creation. His role in the show (that he shares with all the other talent) is to either disprove ("bust") myths or confirm them through testing and experiments done at different scales. If the myth is about a one-time occurrence and not about whether or not something can happen at all, it is often deemed "plausible" instead.
Savage's demeanour on MythBusters is animated and energetic, providing a foil to Jamie Hyneman's more reserved straight man persona.[19]
Savage and Hyneman were the only hosts of the show for the first season of MythBusters. Starting with the second season, members of Hyneman's staff were introduced and began to appear regularly in episodes; Kari Byron, Tory Belleci and welder Scottie Chapman appeared in the second season. In the third season, Chapman was replaced by Grant Imahara, a robot builder and model maker. In an interview Savage gave during The Amaz!ng Meeting 5, he expressed an interest in proving natural selection over creationism on MythBusters.
My goal this year [2007] is to prove natural selection on the show. It's gonna take a while, it's gonna be very hard to make it fascinating on film in the context of our narrative structure, but I figure screw it. The sky's the limit. Let's do natural selection. I'm sick of fifty percent of this country thinking creationism is reasonable. It's appalling. And I have the unique ability, maybe, to sell this idea to Discovery, and they'll, they might allow me to do it, and I'm gonna try as hard as I can.[20]
Savage also stated that such an episode is unlikely because MythBusters has a policy against trying to disprove supernatural phenomena.[21]
Savage and his wife Julia were married in 2002. He has twin sons, Addison and Riley, from a previous relationship.[22] Savage considers himself an atheist.[23] Savage wears a hearing aid on his left ear due to a congenital condition.[24] He is also a practiced juggler as seen on Mythbusters. Savage has a lifelong interest in costume making and cosplay. He said, "I remember my Mom getting me a 'Jaws' costume when 'Jaws' came out...and wearing a Batman costume. Back then, everyone dressed up as hobos." He strives for authenticity with his costumes. While in high school, he and his father made a suit of armor out of aluminum roof flashing that had 700 rivets. He said, "I wore it to school and passed out from heat exhaustion in math class. I woke up in the nurse's office and the first thing I said was 'Where's my armor?'" In 2011, he built a costume based on the character No-Face from the film Spirited Away.[4] In 2012, he was the commencement speaker at Sarah Lawrence College.[25]

Jamie: Adam, Grant and Tory have worked at ILM for some years. I worked there on one job with Grant and we became friends. Adam and Tory had worked with me or for me before then and, in fact, Adam got his first work in the field when I hired him over a decade ago. I found ILM a great place to work and that there were a lot of very talented people there. Many of the people there have worked with me over the years
Jamie: When Domino's Pizza approached M5 Industries and asked us to design and build the Steak Fanatic Pizza Couch, I knew it was something we wanted to be part of. The Steak Fanatic Pizza Couch is like a guy's dream come true -- only the coolest gadgets and Domino's Pizza all within arm's reach
Jamie: He brings a little bit more science to the show. Adam and I have a sense of how things work. Grant actually has an education in how things work
Jamie: I wouldn't want to be next to this when it's running in the water. Because, we built it, and it's just, you know, as likely to fly apart and send a propeller through my head or something
Jamie: Don't mess with me, duck. When I say "quack", you're gonna quack, right? I'm the boss here. Don't give me any beak
Jamie: I always had a fascination with crossbows. I've had one since I was a teenager. That's why there where no cats in the neighborhood."
Jamie:  I'm a little worried because it worked too well, so now we'll go full scale, and it'll blow up.
Jamie: I understanding these things have about a million—or actually, it's 1.3 million—pounds of explosive force. I'm not sure what that means, but it sounds like a lot. 
Jamie: It may look like salami, it may smell like salami, it may even taste like salami but its rocket fuel. 
Jamie:  Putting all of these greenhouses up on the roof, I think I'm gonna get checked out by the police for growing pot or something up here, y'know. It's like "What are you doing?" It looks kinda suspicious
Jamie: Yet again we're blowing things up in front of my shop. And not only that but there are noxious chemicals involved which will probably leave a residue over the whole block and, um…I guess it's okay. I'm getting used to it. So are the neighbors.
Jamie: It seems like you have to take the car tire off in order to change the battery. What is the point? Probably because someone built the damn thing in a computer and doesn't have any sense. Piece of crap. 
				Hi Jamie, Have you ever heard of the concept of a Samurai arrow catcher. A wealth samurai samurai will have a veil on his back, when he is riding away, arrows that are shot towards his back will have their energy dissipated via surface contact with the veil, hence the expression "arrow catcher"  I wonder if a similar construct could be made to catch a bullet
				alright your show is great and all but you have yet to prove if dog tags can really stop a bullet

Jamie Hyneman’s Biography: With his black beret, white t-shirt and bushy moustache, visual effects specialist Jamie Hyneman is busy debunking popular urban legends and rumors through a series of dangerous experiments, which he conducts with co-host Adam Savage, on the Discovery Channel’s reality program Mythbusters . Hyneman, who was born on September 25, 1956, acquired a degree in Russian language and literature, but has taken on a variety of jobs, such as boat captain, pet shop owner, machinist, scuba diver, wilderness survival expert and chef. Moreover, he founded the special effects workshop M5 Industries and built a powerful robot called Blendo. On Mythbusters, Hyneman is clearly the opposite of his co-host Adam Savage. He likes his space to be clean and orderly, and often gets frustrated with Savage’s immature behavior. He is calm and rational and pushes for simplicity when conducting experiments. His appearance is often the source of laughter for Savage and the crew.
