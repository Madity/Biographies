Danica Mae McKellar (born January 3, 1975) is an American actress, film director, book author and education advocate. She played Winnie Cooper in the television show The Wonder Years, and later wrote four non-fiction books: Math Doesn't Suck, Kiss My Math, Hot X: Algebra Exposed and Girls Get Curves: Geometry Takes Shape, which encourage middle-school and high-school girls to have confidence and succeed in mathematics.[1][2]
Born in La Jolla, California, McKellar moved with her family to Los Angeles when she was eight. Her mother Mahalia is a homemaker; her father Christopher is a real estate developer.[3]
Her mother's ancestry is Portuguese (via the Azores and Madeira islands); her father's ancestry is Scottish, Irish, French, German, and Dutch.
McKellar and her sister Crystal McKellar both maintained professional acting careers as children, but with a strong emphasis on education as a priority.
As a result, Crystal became a corporate lawyer, while Danica majored in mathematics. Danica and Crystal also have two half-brothers, Chris Junior and Connor McKellar.[citation needed]
McKellar had a leading role in The Wonder Years, an American television comedy-drama that ran for six seasons on ABC, from 1988 to 1993. She played Gwendolyn "Winnie" Cooper, the main love interest of Kevin Arnold (played by Fred Savage) on the show. Her first kiss was with Fred Savage in an episode of The Wonder Years.[4]
She later said, "My first kiss was a pretty nerve-wracking experience! But we never kissed off screen, and pretty quickly our feelings turned into brother/sister, and stayed that way."[5] Late-night talk show host Jimmy Fallon has said that the character of Winnie Cooper "is the coolest girl in any TV show ever." [6]
McKellar has admitted the transition from "child actor to adult actor was a little bumpy."[5] Since leaving The Wonder Years, McKellar has had several guest roles in television series (including one with former co-star Fred Savage on Working), and has written and directed two short films. She appeared in two Lifetime TV movies in the Moment of Truth series, playing Kristin Guthrie in 1994's Cradle of Conspiracy and Annie Mills Carman in 1996's Justice for Annie. She briefly returned to regular television with a recurring role in the 2002–03 season of The West Wing, portraying Elsie Snuffin, the stepsister and assistant of Deputy White House Communications Director Will Bailey.
McKellar appeared in lingerie in the July 2005 edition of Stuff magazine[dead link][7] after readers voted her the 1990s star they would most like to see in lingerie. McKellar explained that she agreed to the shoot in part to obtain "grittier roles".[5]
In June 2006, Lifetime Television announced that McKellar would star in a Lifetime movie and web-based series titled Inspector Mom about a mother who solves mysteries.[8][9]
On the August 1, 2007, edition of the Don and Mike Show, a WJFK-FM radio program out of Washington, D.C., McKellar announced plans that the producers of How I Met Your Mother were planning to bring her back for a recurring role (she guest-starred on the show in late 2005 in "The Pineapple Incident" and again in early 2007 in "Third Wheel"). She also made an appearance on the show The Big Bang Theory, in the episode "The Psychic Vortex".[10]
In 2008, she starred in Heatstroke, a Sci-Fi Channel original movie about searching for alien life on Earth and in 2009 she was one of the stars commenting on the occurrences of the new millennium in VH1's I Love the New Millennium and was the math correspondent for Brink, a program by the Science Channel about technology. In 2013, she played Ellen Plainview in Lifetime's reimagining of the 1956 Alfred Hitchcock film The Wrong Man.
McKellar has also found work as a voice actress. She is the voice of Miss Martian in Young Justice. She has also provided the voices for two characters in three video games: Jubilee in X-Men Legends (2004), and Invisible Woman in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance (2006) and Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2 (2009).[citation needed]
On March 4th, 2014, she was announced to be joining season 18 of Dancing with the Stars. She paired with Valentin Chmerkovskiy.[11] McKellar and Chmerkovskiy were eliminated on Week 8, finishing in 6th place.
McKellar studied at UCLA and earned a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with honors (summa cum laude) in 1998.[12]
As an undergraduate, she coauthored a scientific paper[13] with Professor Lincoln Chayes and fellow student Brandy Winn entitled "Percolation and Gibbs states multiplicity for ferromagnetic Ashkin-Teller models on ."[14] Their results are termed the 'Chayes–McKellar–Winn theorem'.[15][16]
Referring to the mathematical abilities of his student coauthors, Chayes was quoted in The New York Times as saying, "I thought that the two were really, really first-rate."[17] McKellar's Erdős number is four and her Erdős–Bacon number is 6.[18]
McKellar has authored several mathematics-related books primarily targeting adolescent readers interested in succeeding at the study of mathematics:
McKellar, Danica; Mary Lynn Blasutta (2008). Math Doesn't Suck: How to Survive Middle School Math without Losing Your Mind or Breaking a Nail. New York: Plume (publisher). ISBN 9780452289499.  Cite uses deprecated parameters (help)

McKellar, Danica (2012). Girls Get Curves: Geometry Takes Shape. New York: Hudson Street Press. ISBN 9781594630941. 
Her first book, Math Doesn't Suck: How to Survive Middle School Math without Losing Your Mind or Breaking a Nail, was a New York Times bestseller,[1] and was favorably reviewed by Tara C. Smith, the founder of Iowa Citizens for Science and a professor of epidemiology at the University of Iowa.[19] The book also received a review from Anthony Jones, writing for the School Librarian journal, who described the book as "a trouble-shooting guide to help girls overcome their biggest maths challenges," noting what he described as "real-world examples of great mathematics in action."[20] In an interview with Smith, McKellar said that she wrote the book "to show girls that math is accessible and relevant, and even a little glamorous" and to counteract "damaging social messages telling young girls that math and science aren't for them".[21]
McKellar's second book, Kiss My Math: Showing Pre-Algebra Who's Boss,[22] was released on August 5, 2008. The book's target audience is girls in the 7th through 9th grades. Her third book, Hot X: Algebra Exposed![23] covers algebra topics, while the previous two titles were intended as "algebra-readiness books."[24] Hot X was published on August 3, 2010. Her fourth book, Girls Get Curves – Geometry Takes Shape,[25] focuses on the subject of geometry, and attempts to make the subject more accessible.[26]

McKellar was named Person of the Week on World News with Charles Gibson for the week ending August 10, 2007. The news segment highlighted her book Math Doesn't Suck and her efforts to help girls develop an interest in mathematics, especially during the middle school years.[29] In January 2014, she received the Joint Policy Board for Mathematics (JPBM) Communications Award. The citation credited her books, blog, and public appearances for encouraging "countless middle and high school students, especially girls, to be more interested in mathematics."[30]
She married composer Mike Verta on March 22, 2009, in La Jolla, California; the couple had dated since 2001.[31] They had their first child, a son named Draco, in 2010,[32][33] McKellar filed for divorce from Verta in June 2012,[34] with the dissolution becoming final in February 2013.[citation needed]
On August 20, 2013, Canadian singer Avril Lavigne released her music video for new single "Rock N Roll" from her upcoming self-titled fifth album, which features McKellar as 'Winnie Cooperre'. The video is described to be "a weird but funny video" with scenes including a bearshark, lobster and one which shows Lavigne & McKellar kiss after a car crash.[35] The single became available to buy on iTunes on August 27, 2013.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Together with her younger sister, Crystal McKellar, she began acting at a young age in her mother's dance studio. In 1982 the family moved to Los Angeles and a few years later she appeared in her first commercial. A few guest appearances in The Twilight Zone (1985) was followed by her breakthrough in The Wonder Years (1988). She has had good grades in math and French. In her spare time she likes to go skiing, swimming and surfing.
          Best known as America's alluring dream girl from her days as Winnie Cooper on The Wonder Years (1988), Danica McKellar made her breakthrough at the early age of 12. After that show ended, she went on to graduate Summa cum Laude from UCLA with a degree in Mathematics, and even proved a new math theorem, the Chayes-McKellar-Winn Theorem.Since returning to acting, Danica became familiar again to audiences from her year-long turn as the sardonic, dry-witted Elsie Snuffin on The West Wing (1999) in its 4th season. Since then, Danica made guest appearances on shows such as NYPD Blue (1993), Jack & Bobby (2004), Eve (2003), NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service (2003), and she played a strung-out heroin addict on Lifetime's Strong Medicine (2000).Danica got her feet wet as a filmmaker with her award-winning short film Speechless... (2001) (co-starring The Wonder Years (1988) pal Dan Lauria), which she wrote, directed, and produced.Danica made her debut lingerie spread in the July 2005 issue of Stuff Magazine, in which she appears on the cover. Her pictures can also be seen on its Web site. Talk about allure.
      Had a 1998 paper published in Britain's "Journal of Physics A: Mathematics & General" with UCLA professor Lincoln Chayes and student Brandy Winn that provided a mathematical proof for a theorem dealing with magnetism in two dimensions. Her Erdos number is, at most, four; her Bacon number, by comparison, is two.
      Played the role of "Catherine" in a San Diego production of David Auburn's play "Proof". Catherine is an unlikely mathematical genius who writes a groundbreaking proof at a very young age; McKellar is also an unlikely mathematical genius (she was the only undergraduate invited to speak at Rutgers University's biannual Statistical Mechanics) who wrote a proof at a very young age.
      Did all her own dancing and lifts in "21 and a Wakeup" with partner Jamie Bayard, of So You Think You Can Dance (2005) fame.
      Is now a two-time New York Times bestselling author with books "Kiss My Math" (2008) and "Math Doesn't Suck" (2007).
      One of the few people to have both an Erdös number (the number of scientific-paper authors it takes to connect herself to the Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdös) AND a Bacon number (the the degree of separation between her and American actor Kevin Bacon). Many scientists and mathematicians have an Erdös number, and a great many actors have a Bacon number, but relatively few people have both.
      Gave birth to her 1st child at age 35, a son Draco Verta on September 7, 2010. Child's father is her estranged husband, Mike Verta.
      Starring as Catherine in the stage play "Proof" at the San Diego Repertory Theatre. [October 2003]
      I learned my French through school. I was lucky in that the tutor on The Wonder Years (1988) set spoke fluent French.
      My main concern with the condition of mathematics in high school is that there's a lot of fear involved! Math is not, generally speaking, presented in a fun way. The concepts, as I see them, ARE fun, and that's the way I'd like to convey them myself.
      When I originally entered UCLA, I had planned to go for a film major, but I kept finding myself taking math classes for fun, 'cause I missed them from high school!

Danica McKellar may have played cute, little Winnie Cooper in "The Wonder Years," but nowadays she's a new mom. Also, did she deliver her new baby all naturally?
Danica McKellar and Candace Cameron Bure talk about the boyfriend they had in common in their youth on the 2014 season premiere of Dancing with the Stars.
Meryl Davis and Maksim Chmerkovskiy bring Carrie Ann Inaba to tears with their Freestyle dance, which Bruno Tonioli tries to award an 11, during the Finals of the 2014 season of Dancing with the Stars.
Jane White is the twisted romantic comedy of a girl who thinks that Gerry King, the most insane talk show host on TV, is her father. Jane tries to do anything and everything to be on his show, and meet her long lost dad.
In part two of the season finale, the final scores are tallied, and the season 18 champion is crowned and awarded the Mirror-ball trophy.
In part one of the season finale, the celebrities and their pro-dancing partners enter the performance finals.

Dancing with the Stars champ Meryl Davis knows the importance of chemistry. In fact, she thinks the romantic energy between her and partner Maks Chmerkovskiy was certainly a key to her claiming the Mirrorball trophy.
It only took 18 seasons (and nearly a decade) for me to tune in to even a minute of ABC's Dancing With the Stars. I'll admit that nostalgia for some of my cherished '90s TV stars Candace Cameron Bure and Danica McKellar, combined with a small crush on boy-bander James Maslow, piqued my interest. But halfway through that first episode, I knew right away that I was hooked.
What started as unexpected enjoyment has quickly evolved into a mild obsession. I get mad when a team's score seems unjust or excited when a duo nails their performance. I get nervous when one of my favorites is deemed "unsafe." I can't get enough of the behind-the-scenes action, the fun banter and watching the relationships develop between the stars and their pros. 
Danica McKellar broke a rib while rehearsing for Dancing with the Stars, The Wonder Years alum wrote on Twitter Friday.
Our top moments of the week:  13. Best Kiss: After Adam's laser-tag-turned-make-out birthday party on The Goldbergs goes awry, it seems like he won't get his first kiss after all.

Erin Andrews is four weeks into her new gig as co-host of Dancing with the Stars, and while her presence in the ballroom has been a breath of fresh air for viewers in Season 18, the transition period has not exactly been bump-free.
Last week, some tabloid reports surfaced, quoting anonymous sources who accused Andrews of "diva" behavior on the set, and speculated that ABC might already be looking to replace her. (Executive producer Conrad Green has vehemently denied that there's any animosity behind the scenes.)
"I've got to be honest. ... It kind of got me worried and scared," Andrews told TVGuide.com last week, noting that she immediately called producers to do damage control. "I just went back and forth with the producers like, 'Are we good here? Please tell me what I need to work on. Please tell me what I need to do. 'And they're like, 'We couldn't be happier.'"

Danica McKellar completely avoided the child actor curse, proving every day that she does not fit any stereotype. She is now a successful adult actress, author and mathematician.
McKellar began her acting career as a child, first appearing in a commercial in 1982. She appeared on the Twilight Zone in 1985, but it was at age 12 that she vaulted to television fame as Winnie Cooper on The Wonder Years.
When McKellar entered UCLA, her math skills began to eclipse her previous fame. She tutored in calculus and was the head of the study group program of her Alpha Delta Pi sorority. She continued acting with the Shakespeare group.
In 1998 McKellar made mathematical history. Under the guidance of professor Lincoln Chayes, McKellar and fellow student Brandy Winn proved a groundbreaking physics theorem, now called the Chayes-McKellar-Winn Theorem. Their work was published in the prestigious Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General.
In 1999, after earning her bachelor’s degree, McKellar returned to acting, starring as Elsie Snuffin in the fourth season of The West Wing. McKellar wrote, directed and produced her short Speechless with John Milton Branton, which won the Slate Award for Best Short at the California Independent Film Festival in 2002. In 2004, McKellar wrote, directed and executive produced another independent film, Talking in Your Sleep.
She continued her acting career, joining former co-star Fred Savage for a guest role on his TV series Working. She also appeared on How I Met Your Mother, The Big Bang Theory, Eve, NCIS, Jack and Bobby, NYPD Blue, and Heatstroke.
McKellar is an accomplished voice actress, lending her voice to the shows King of the Hill and Static Shock as well as three video games. She also appeared as herself on VH1’s I Love the New Millennium and was the math correspondent for Brink, a Science Channel show about new technology.
McKellar continues to make strides in mathematics. She is a spokesperson for Figure This!, a government-sponsored site that features math challenges for kids. She also authored three math books, two of which were New York Times best sellers, Math Doesn’t Suck (2007) and Kiss My Math (2008).
McKellar earned her degree in mathematics from UCLA and graduated summa cum laude. In 2005, she served as a celebrity Spring Sing judge, and she is a lifetime member of the UCLA Alumni Association.
