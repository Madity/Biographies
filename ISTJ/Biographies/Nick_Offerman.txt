Nick Offerman (born June 26, 1970) is an American actor, writer, and carpenter widely known for his breakout role as Ron Swanson in the acclaimed NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation, in which he received the Television Critics Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy.
Offerman was born in Joliet, Illinois, and grew up in Minooka, Illinois.[2] He is the son of Cathy (née Roberts), a nurse, and Ric Offerman, who taught social studies at a junior high school in nearby Channahon.[3][4][5] Offerman was raised Catholic[6][7] and received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1993.[2] That year, he and a group of fellow students co-founded the Defiant Theatre, a Chicago-based theatre company.[2]
Offerman lived in Chicago in the mid-1990s, where he participated with theatre companies such as Steppenwolf, Goodman, and Wisdom Bridge. At Steppenwolf, he also worked as a fight choreographer and master carpenter.[8] During this time, Offerman became acquainted with Amy Poehler, who was heavily involved with the Chicago improv comedy scene.[2]
In 2003, he married Will & Grace actress Megan Mullally and has also appeared on her talk show, The Megan Mullally Show. At the same time, he began appearing on television: as a plumber on Will & Grace during its fourth season's Thanksgiving episode, on King of Queens as a hobo, in three episodes of 24, and in an episode of The West Wing. Prior to Parks and Recreation, his most prominent role was as factory worker and Benny-Lopez-love-interest Randy McGee on George Lopez. He appeared twice on Gilmore Girls, in 2003's The Festival of Living Art" and 2005's "Always a Godmother, Never a God". Offerman played would-be assassin of Wild Bill Hickok, Tom Mason, in an early episode of the HBO series Deadwood and in the third-season episode of Monk "Mr. Monk and the Election" as a helper for the campaign of Natalie Teeger. In 2007, Offerman co-starred in the Comedy Central series American Body Shop.
In 2009, Office producers Michael Schur and Greg Daniels offered Offerman a regular supporting role in their NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation: that of Ron Swanson, the deadpan, government-hating head of a government parks department and therefore boss of Amy Poehler's character Leslie Knope.[2] Slate magazine declared Offerman "Parks and Recreation's secret weapon", and said he regularly stole scenes and "has a gift for understated physical comedy".[9] The role weaves antagonism and political philosophy with humanity, while the intense libertarian philosophy the character lives out is often played off against the equally intense liberalism and 'do-gooder' mentality of Poehler's character, Leslie Knope. Offerman has said that supporting parts such as that of Parks and Recreation are his ideal roles, and that he draws particular inspiration from Reverend Jim Ignatowski, the character played by Christopher Lloyd in the sitcom Taxi.[2]
Offerman has also been featured in the Adult Swim series Childrens Hospital with Rob Corddry and Rob Huebel. He is the voice of Axe Cop in the animated series of the same name, premiered on July 27, 2013.[10] In the same year, Offerman portrayed Johnny Cool in the "Boston" episode of Derek Waters' Drunk History on Comedy Central.
In October 2013, Offerman released a book titled Paddle Your Own Canoe: One Man's Fundamentals for Delicious Living, in which he shares his humorous ruminations on life, manliness, meat, and of course, growing the perfect mustache. [11]
Offerman has appeared in films such as November (2004), Cursed (2005), Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous (2005), Sin City (2005), The Men Who Stare at Goats (2009), and The Kings of Summer (2013). He also appeared in the 2006 film Wristcutters: A Love Story as a cop who attempts to arrest Shannyn Sossamon's character, Mikal. 2012 saw him in two film roles, as 21 Jump Street's Deputy Chief Hardy and in Casa de Mi Padre as DEA Agent Parker. Additionally, he starred and produced an independent film, Somebody Up There Likes Me (2012), shot in Austin, Texas. He appeared in the 2013 comedy We're the Millers, which starred Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston. He voiced Metalbeard in The Lego Movie. Offerman conceived of and starred in punk band FIDLAR's 2013 video for their song "Cocaine".[12]
In addition to acting, Offerman is also a professional boat builder and has a side business as a wood craftsman. Offerman makes furniture and other wooden structures such as canoes and boats at his woodshop.[13] He also released an instructional DVD in 2008 titled Fine Woodstrip Canoe Building with Nick Offerman, shot by Jimmy Diresta. Diresta's pay for shooting the DVD was a canoe, the second one Offerman has built.[14] The writers of Parks and Recreation added a fondness for woodworking to Offerman's character.
Offerman has been married to actress Megan Mullally since 20 September 2003.[15] They met while doing a play with the Evidence Room Theatre Company called The Berlin Circle,[16] and married after dating for eighteen months. Mullally has a recurring role on Parks and Recreation as his character's second ex-wife, Tammy. They have also appeared together in The Kings of Summer and in the play Annapurna.[16]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Nick Offerman was born on June 26, 1970 in Joliet, Illinois, USA. He is known for his work on Parks and Recreation (2009), We're the Millers (2013) and 21 Jump Street (2012). He has been married to Megan Mullally since September 20, 2003.
      He was awarded the 1997 Joseph Jefferson Award Citation for Actor in a Supporting Role in a Play for "The Kentucky Cycle" at the Pegasus Players in Chicago, Illinois.
      B. Emil Boulos, Joe Foust, Andrew Leman, Sean Sinitski, Chris Thometz and he were awarded the 1998 Joseph Jefferson Award Citation for Puppetry and Masks for the play, "The Skriker", at the Defiant Theatre in Chicago, Illinois.

      His book "Paddle Your Own Canoe: One Man's Principles for Delicious Living" (a 'rant and a memoir') is due out in October 2013.
      [on his role as Ron Swanson, the government-hating bureaucrat in Parks and Recreation (2009) People have asked me if Ron would be a member of the Tea Party, and the answer is always that Ron is a committee of one, and regardless of what is going on in the country, he stands by his simple principles. If (he) had a campaign slogan it would be 'Paddle Your Own Canoe'.
      his one-man show 'American Ham'] I was invited to speak at some colleges. I didn't want to be so egotistical as to show up and say: 'Thank you for the tidy appearance fee. Please feast your eyes upon me.' So I wrote a show. I like to say that I am a more foulmouthed, less-educated Garrison Keillor.
      Something about stentorian authority figures has always made me laugh. I also noticed that lots of the performers I was working with had a big, obnoxious energy that I quickly realized I could never match - and that when they finally finished being loud, with one well-placed remark I could also achieve some sort of comic victory.
      his role in The Kings of Summer (2013)] It evokes a great sense of nostalgia for all the idyllic teenage escape films of our youth. For me, it's Stand by Me (1986), The Goonies (1985) and Dead Poets Society (1989), movies about breaking away from the authoritative society of your parents or your school, finding your own way, making your own rules and then falling back into the embrace of your parents or your headmaster. And hopefully your headmaster's embrace is purely platonic.
      [advice for would-be actors] Make the rest of your life happy. For me, when I started dating [wife] Megan [Mullally], my auditions became so much better, because I knew that when I came home from the audition I got to kiss her. I didn't give a damn about the audition nearly as much, and that gave me a sense of confidence.
      Megan and I agree that successful dancing is 99 percent the face you make. If you're at a wedding reception and you're dancing like a maniac on the dance floor? As long as you're making the right face, no one will fault you. If you're taking yourself too seriously, that's when you can look like a jackass. Even then, I would highly recommend making a jackass of yourself over sitting at your table wishing you were working it out to Kool & The Gang.

Parks and Recreation shocked viewers on Thursday night after ousting Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) from office, not a route fans would've expected the show to go after the NBC comedy worked so hard to make her a city councilwoman. In fact...
In the spring of 2009, a new kind of romance was born on NBC when overeager bureaucrat Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) met sweet nurse Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones) on the Parks and Recreation series premiere. Over the last six seasons, their journey has spawned catchphrases, beautiful compliments and a new faith in female friendships on television. However, that will all soon come to an end when Jones and co-star Rob Lowe leave the comedy early next year.
"Amy and Rashida, like Leslie and Ann, are dealing with it in real time," Jones tells TVGuide.com. "Amy has been saying to people, 'She thinks she's leaving, but I'm going to lock her in my trailer.' I'm a little bit in denial about it, too."

Nick Offerman stars as boss Ron Swanson in NBC's comedy "Parks and Recreation." The series is a half-hour mockumentary that looks at the exciting world of local government.
Offerman received his B.F.A. in theater from the University of Illinois and has performed at Chicago's famed Goodman and Steppenwolf theaters. He was a series regular on "American Body Shop" and has appeared on "24," "Deadwood," "Will & Grace," "Monk," "The West Wing," "CSI: NY," and "NYPD Blue."
Nick was last seen on the silver screen in "Men Who Stare at Goats" with George Clooney and Ewan McGregor and "All Good Things" with Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst. Other credits include "Wristcutters," "Patriotville," "The Go Getter," "Sin City," and "Miss Congeniality 2." 
=======================================================
Biography:Nick Offerman was born on June 26, 1970 in the small town of Joliet, IL. As a child, acting was the farthest thing on his mind; he grew up working on his grandparents' farm, where he first nurtured an interest in woodworking. He did not pursue acting until after college, graduating with a Fine Arts degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-C... Continue Bio >>Photo Gallery:

Actor Nick Offerman honed an immediately identifiable image -- that of a rugged, imposing presence with an unmistakably menacing onscreen aura, occasionally tempered by nuttiness -- and parlayed it into a long string of offbeat characterizations. After guest spots on such prime-time series as ER and Gilmore Girls, and bit parts in features including Treasure Island (1999), Groove (2000), and November (2003), Offerman graduated to lead status with a decidedly wacky triple role in Martin Hynes' road movie The Go-Getter (2007). That same year, audiences could also catch Offerman via his small supporting role as a cop in Goran Dukic's jet-black comic romance Wristcutters: A Love Story. Meanwhile, Offerman also signed for one of the lead roles -- as an auto mechanic -- on the satirical Comedy Central series American Body Shop (2007). In 2009 he was cast as Ron Swanson in the NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation, and this turned out to be his breakthrough role. He parlayed that success into appearances in films like The Men Who Stare at Goats, All Good Things, Casa de me Padre, and the big-screen comedy version of 21 Jump Street. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi
