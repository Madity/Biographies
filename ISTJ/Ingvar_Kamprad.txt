=======================================================
Ingvar Feodor Kamprad ( pronunciation (help·info); born 30 March 1926) is a Swedish business magnate. He is the founder of IKEA, a Swedish retail company specialising in furniture.
Kamprad was born in Pjätteryd (now part of Älmhult Municipality), Sweden. He was raised on a farm called Elmtaryd (presently standardized Älmtaryd) near the small village of Agunnaryd in Ljungby Municipality in the province of Småland, Sweden. His paternal grandfather was from Germany but moved the family to Sweden.
Kamprad began to develop a business as a young boy, selling matches to neighbors from his bicycle. He found that he could buy matches in bulk very cheaply from Stockholm, sell them individually at a low price, and still make a good profit. From matches, he expanded to selling fish, Christmas tree decorations, seeds, and later ballpoint pens and pencils. When Kamprad was 17, his father gave him a cash reward for succeeding in his studies.[3]
IKEA was founded in 1943 at Kamprad's uncle Ernst's kitchen table.[4] In 1948, Kamprad diversified his portfolio, adding furniture. His business was mostly mail-order.[4] The acronym IKEA is made up of the initials of his name (Ingvar Kamprad) plus those of Elmtaryd, the family farm where he was born, and the nearby village Agunnaryd.
In June 2013, Ingvar Kamprad resigned from the board of Inter IKEA Holding SA and his youngest son Mathias Kamprad replaced Per Ludvigsson as the chairman of the holding company. Following his decision to step down, the 87-year-old founder explained, ”I see this as a good time for me to leave the board of Inter IKEA Group. By that we are also taking another step in the generation shift that has been ongoing for some years.” Mathias and his two older brothers, who also have leadership roles at IKEA, work on the corporation's overall vision and long-term strategy.[5]
According to Swedish business weekly Veckans Affärer,[6] he is one of the wealthiest people in the world. This report is based on the assumption that Kamprad owns the entire company, an approach that both IKEA and the Kamprad family reject. Kamprad retains little ownership in the company, having transferred his interest to Stichting INGKA Foundation and INGKA Holding as part of a complex tax sheltering scheme that leaves his actual degree of control vague.[7]
In March 2010, Forbes magazine estimated his fortune at US$23 billion, making him the eleventh richest person in the world. A year later, he fell from 11th place to 162nd after his lawyers produced documents that prove the foundation he created, and heads, in Liechtenstein owns IKEA, and its bylaws bar him and his family from benefiting from its funds.[8] In October 2012, Ingvar Kamprad was listed as the fifth wealthiest person in the world in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with an estimated net worth of $42.6 billion.[9] As of February 2014[update], Ingvar's net worth was reported by Forbes to be $4.2 billion.[1]
The Dutch-registered Stichting INGKA Foundation is named after Ingvar Kamprad (i.e. ING + KA) who owns INGKA Holding, the parent company for all IKEA stores. The charitable foundation was reported by the business newspaper The Economist in May 2006 to be technically the world's wealthiest charity – with an estimated value of at least US$36 billion in 2006 (larger than the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) – but its primary purpose is corporate tax-optimization and anti-takeover protection for IKEA.[7] Kamprad is chairman of the foundation.
While generally a private person, Kamprad has published a few notable works. He first detailed the IKEA concept of frugality and enthusiasm in a manifesto entitled A Testament of a Furniture Dealer. Written in 1976, it has since been considered the fundamental ideology of the IKEA furniture retail concept. He also worked with Swedish journalist Bertil Torekull on the book Leading by Design: The IKEA Story. In the autobiographical account, he further describes his philosophies and the trials and triumphs of the founding of IKEA.[10]
There are many stories about Ingvar Kamprad that are a part of his heritage. When he talks to IKEA staff at different locations, his main theme is often management by example, and he uses himself as an example. He always travels economy class in planes, and if he goes by train, if possible, he will sit in second class. He never stays at expensive hotels, and his theme from the A Testament of a Furniture Dealer, simplicity, is totally integrated in all activities within IKEA.
In 1994, the personal letters of the Swedish fascist activist Per Engdahl were made public after his death, and it was revealed that Kamprad had joined Engdahl's pro-fascist New Swedish Movement in 1942, at the age of 16. Kamprad had raised funds for and recruited members to said group at least as late as September 1945. When Kamprad quit the group is unknown, but he remained a friend of Engdahl until the early 1950s.[11] Kamprad devotes two chapters to his time in Nysvenska Rörelsen in his book, Leading By Design: The IKEA Story and, in a 1994 letter to IKEA employees, called his affiliation with the organization the "greatest mistake of his life."[3] Kamprad has explained his teenage engagement in New Swedish Movement as being politically influenced by his father and grandmother in Sudet-Germany.[12] In 2011, journalist Elisabeth Åsbrink revealed that the Swedish secret service created a file on Kamprad already in 1943 titled "Nazi" and that Kamprad in an interview in 2010 told her: "Per Engdahl is a great man, and I will maintain that as long as I live".[13]
Kamprad has lived in Epalinges, Switzerland, since 1976. According to an interview with TSR, the French-language Swiss TV broadcaster, Kamprad drives a 1993 Volvo 240, flies only economy class, and encourages IKEA employees always to write on both sides of a piece of paper.[14] He reportedly recycles tea bags and is known to pocket the salt and pepper packets at restaurants."[4] In addition, Kamprad has been known to visit IKEA for a "cheap meal". He is known for purchasing Christmas paper and presents in post-Christmas sales. The firm he created is still known for the attention it gives to cost control, operational details and continuous product development, allowing it to lower its prices by an average of 2-3% over the decade to 2010, while continuing its global expansion. Kamprad explains his social philosophy in his "Testament of a Furniture Dealer": "It is not only for cost reasons that we avoid the luxury hotels. We don't need flashy cars, impressive titles, uniforms or other status symbols. We rely on our strength and our will!" [4] Kamprad owns a villa in upmarket Switzerland, a large country estate in Sweden and a vineyard in Provence, France. Additionally, Kamprad was known for driving a Porsche for several years.[15][16][17]
While working with furniture manufacturers in Poland earlier in his career, Kamprad became an alcoholic. In 2004, he said that his drinking was under control.[18]
Kamprad's second wife, Margaretha Kamprad-Stennert, died from an undisclosed disease in 2011.[19][20] In June 2013, Ingvar Kamprad announced that he intended to move back to Småland in Sweden by the end of the year.[21][needs update]

Ingvar Feodor Kamprad is a Swedish businessman. He is the creator of the famous and one of the largest furniture retail companies of the world ‘IKEA’. He is one of world’s wealthiest people and most successful entrepreneurs. 
Kamprad was born on 30th March 1926 in Pjätteryd, Sweden. He grew up on a farm called Elmtaryd situated in a small village of Agunnaryd. As a young boy he started to get involved in small business deals. Initially, he sold matches in the neighborhood. Then he went on to selling Christmas tree decorations, fish and then pens and pencils. He had a very good business sense and taught himself many business tricks. At the age of 17, he was rewarded some cash by his father for getting good grades in his studies.
Kamprad founded IKEA in 1943 at his Uncle Ernst’s kitchen table. IKEA was basically an acronym of his name Ingvar Kamprad and Elmtaryd, his family farm and the village Agunnaryd. At first the business was typically mail-order and included only small household goods such as picture frames, wallets, nylon stockings, pens and wallets. Five years later he expanded to include furniture. The furniture was delivered in trucks to homes as well as train stations. Despite his dyslexia problem the company flourished. By 1950s all other goods were removed from IKEA’s catalog and the prime focus was kept on furniture only. Kamprad started feeling pressurized by the intense competition and in 1953 decided to open up a showroom in Almhult.
In order to eliminate the storage costs and lower the shipping costs Kamprad came up with the idea of selling furniture that the consumers could assemble themselves. In the following years he continued to come up with various unique ideas of turning customer needs to retail prospects. The first consumer retail warehouse was opened in 1965 in Stockholm. Within 2 decades the store had expanded worldwide to 114 outlets in 25 countries. Most of these stores are owned by a privately operated INGKA Foundation which is a charitable organization. Ingvar Kamprad is the chairman and founder of this foundation.
Despite the fact that Kamprad owns several estates and properties, he is known for being very frugal. This persona is also part of his publicity for IKEA and this is the example he wants to set for his employees as well. According to ‘Veckans Affärer’, a Swedish magazine he is one of the richest people of the world. According to Forbes magazine, Ingvar Kamprad was the 4th wealthiest person of the world in 2007 with a net worth of $33 billion. In 2010, his wealth decreased to $23 billion making him 11th the world’s richest person. In October 2012, Ingvar Kamprad was the 5th richest person according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a net worth of $42.6 billion and as of March 2013 his net worth was calculated to be $3.3 billion due to transferring of his equity in IKEA irrevocably to entities beyond his control.
Kamprad was known to be pro-Nazi however he realized this mistake, publicly apologized and wrote letters to his workers admitting his blunder.

In this success story we are going to share Ingvar Kamprad biography, a Swedish entrepreneur, billionaire and who is considered one of the richest men in the world. He is the founder of IKEA, a network of furniture stores with affordable prices. Ingvar Kamprad always wanted people around the world to have been able to buy beautiful furniture and home furnishings and this desire became his mission. Contents
Ingvar Feodor Kamprad was born on March 30, 1926 in a small province Smalandiya in Pjätteryd (now part of Älmhult Municipality), Southern Sweden. Kamprad’s biographers believe that the trading hobby was passed to Ingvar by inheritance. In 1897, the company, that belonged to the grandfather of the future billionaire was on the verge of bankruptcy. His grandfather could not pay the mortgage and committed suicide. But the Ingvar’s grandmother was able to save the business. So she taught her grandson to bridge over the difficulties with willpower and perseverance. Ingvar’s grandmother Francis had a huge positive impact not only on him, but on the entire family. She was a very intelligent woman, although a simple origin though.
People, who closely work with Ingvar Kamprad, say that he is a brilliant marketer, wise man who never makes a mistake. Indeed, the strategy of Kamprad is studied and examined by major entrepreneurs from around the world. Although, as artfully Ingvar says about himself, he is a dropout. And this is true as he never attended a university (school teachers could not teach him to read for a long time). The lack of a university degree Kamprad always replaced with enthusiasm. Once he remarked: “If you work and do not feel incorrigible enthusiasm, consider that at least a third of your life has gone down the drain.”
First bargains young Kamprad made ​​in childhood. He bought pencils and matches in bulk, which he then resold to classmates for a profit. During the study Ingvar managed to try a variety of activities: from fish to Christmas cards trading. And that was the real school. He was neither trained doing business nor he read books on the subject. But what we know exactly today is that the IKEA company came through thanks to the personal experience and care of the founder.
In the field of business, I guess I was a little different from the others, as I has started to show business activity very early. My aunt helped me to buy the first one hundred boxes of matches on the sale of so-called “88 Øre” in Stockholm. The whole package was worth 88 øre, and the aunt did not even make ​​me pay for postage costs. After that I sold a box of matches at a price of 2 or 3 øre and some of 5 øre. I still remember the pleasant sensation experienced by receiving my first profit. At the time, I was no more than five years.
The future entrepreneur set money aside. While school peers spent their time at football fields and dating with girls, Ingvar Kamprad was thinking about how to expand the business. And in 1943, when he was 17 years he added money, borrowed from his father (who, however, was convinced that he’s giving money his son for his studies), to the accumulated capital and opened his IKEA. The name IKEA is derived from Kamprad’s initials (I.K.) plus the first letters of Elmtaryd and Agunnaryd, the farm and village where he grew up.
At the beginning of its operation, the young Kamprad engaged in the trade of different things (from matches to discount stockings). But the biggest demand was for pen. At the beginning of 1940s they were a novelty even in Sweden. Kamprad ordered 500 pens from Paris, taking a loan of 500 SEK in a district bank (at the time around 63 USD). According to Kamprad, this was the first and the last loan that he had taken in his life.
To attract prospective customers to the presentation of the store, the young entrepreneur promised a free cup of coffee and a bun to everyone who would come. Imagine his surprise when this modest event attracted more than a thousand people! The first presentation of the day was about to become the last one. Nevertheless, everyone got a cup of coffee and a bun. And the idea about opening a ​​fast food restaurant in each store looked great for the owner of IKEA. Time passed and each IKEA store got a ​​fast food restaurant.
Further, a young entrepreneur draws attention to a feature of life in Sweden: furniture was luxury for most people due to the high cost. In 1948, Ingvar Kamprad comes up with a fresh idea and he decides to engage in trade of furniture. Further it will be the main source of profit for IKEA.
Guimars Fabriker from Alvesta, who was my main competitor, has been selling furniture in Kagnuit for a long time. I saw his ad in an agricultural newspaper and also decided to try my hand in the business. Thus, furniture sale, which I started by chance, and solely in order to outdo my competitors, has determined my fate.
After finding places where he could buy the cheapest furniture, Ingvar agreed with fine upholstery manufacturers. The range of his store was replenished with a coffee table and a chair without armrest. The chair was called ‘Root’. Since then, every good in the store had its own name. The names was invented by the owner of the company, due to his inability to remember the numeric items.
In 1951, IKEA started spreading booklets among its customers called ‘IKEA News’. They were those booklets that became a prototype of the modern IKEA catalogs. Young entrepreneur’s business was targeted to customers with medium and low incomes. For this, he ordered cheap furniture at local furniture factories. It was then when he invented his famous formula: “It’s better sell 600 chairs at a lower price, than sell 60 chairs at a high price”.
From Ingvar Kamprad biography we learned that in the early 50′s he bought an old small factory in Sweden, which let him to put on a production flow even cheaper furniture for his stores. It was ‘nonsense’ to the country where the furniture had always been considered an expensive commodity. Such a risky move could not remain unnoticed by competitors. Kamprad was boycotted. The Swedish Federation of Wood and Furniture Industry was so outraged by IKEA’s dumping prices that persuaded leading loggers cease all cooperation with IKEA.
Perhaps such turn for any businessman could have been tragic, but not for Ingvar Kamprad and not for the IKEA brand. Any problem and its solution generates new stages of a company’s development. As a result, the entrepreneur had to make an unusual step for the Swedish business at the time: he began to acquire some furniture components on the cheap from Polish suppliers. This is how the founder of IKEA laid the future strategy of the company and purchased furniture components in those countries where they are cheaper.
The first IKEA furniture showroom was opened in 1953 in Älmhult, Sweden. Сustomers could look and touch IKEA home furnishings before purchasing them. And five years later a new ​​6,700 square meter store was opened which was more or less similar to what we see today under huge IKEA signboard. By the way, initially the traditional company’s colors were red and white. Nowadays the IKEA network is painted in yellow and blue, the national colors of Sweden.
During that period, Ingvar Kamprad was no longer a miracle child of Småland. He turned into a confident, sleek and dangerous competitor, whose methods sometimes were perceived with contempt and resentment.
In the early 60′s, Kamprad made a cognitive trip to the United States. There he first saw how the Cash & Carry trade system worked. He liked that form of trade where customers paid in cash and carry the goods away themselves. In 1965, the largest 31,000 square meter IKEA Kungens Kurva store was opened near Stockholm. Things were arranged there taking into the account the American experience, however, they were creatively improved. First, the store was opened in a suburb. Rental land costs there were much lower, and there was built a spacious car parking lot. Second, to reduce the transportation costs, the company ordered a ready-to-assemble furniture, where every detail was placed in a flat package. It was easier and cheaper to transport it and customers had to assemble the furniture themselves. Kamprad had noticed that people actually liked to self-assemble cabinets and sofas. Especially, if the assembling process was so simple thanks to the detailed instructions. Also, Ingvar knew that a car boom began in Sweden and he realized that people were ready to go shopping to distant lands. To encourage customers to go shopping in IKEA, they started selling them roof racks for cars for a knockdown price. Thanks to this policy the company’s turnover has doubled in one year.
The largest store in Sweden looked like The New York’s Guggenheim Museum, which Kamprad found very attractive. However, when Ingvar Kamprad opened it, he did not take into account one thing: a possible shortage of goods on the store’s shelves. A huge number of people, literally swept the IKEA products from the store’s shelves. Thirty thousand Swedes would certainly want to buy furnishings at low prices. And even in such large store there weren’t so much goods to sell and a considerable part of them left at warehouse unpacked.
Ingvar Kamprad made ​​the only right decision in this situation and opened a self-serve warehouse. So, quite by accident, IKEA found a formula for success, which provided profits for many years. The self-serve warehouse was just the right thing what a modern client needed. Now every IKEA furniture store is a kind of showroom, where there are exhibited not only sofas and cabinets, but any little things of everyday life: tablecloths, curtains, bedspreads, towels and candle holders. Thus, the visitor can see ten children’s rooms in a row, and then twenty-five dining rooms or living rooms and so on. By imagining what a particular furniture will look in his interior, a customer should go for it to the self-serve warehouse. Then a customer transports the furniture in comfortable packages to his home and and then assembles it by reading clear and sensible instructions.
After the success at home, IKEA had nothing to do but to explore overseas markets. In 1963, IKEA starting its expansion with Norway and opens the first store outside Sweden in Oslo. In addition, in the 1960s, IKEA introduced a quality control system that allowed the company’s products to be recognized as the best quality ones by several Swedish reputable journals. Decisions were made spontaneously. For example, the head of the company’s hesitated for a long time whether to open a store in Switzerland. The country was known for its conservative tastes, besides there were two local furniture chains that operated quite well. But once Ingvar Kamprad, walking around Zurich, overheard a young couple. “What a beautiful chair!” – a  young woman said, looking into the window. “Yes, but it is still too expensive for us. Let’s buy it next year”, – her husband replied. This episode was crucial. And soon, in 1973, IKEA appeared in Switzerland. And then in Australia, Netherlands, France, USA. Now IKEA operates 338 stores in 40 countries.
In 1986, Ingvar Kamprad retired from Group Management and became an advisor to the parent company INGKA Holding B.V. Anders Moberg was assigned as the President and CEO of the IKEA Group. In 1990s, the IKEA Group developed and introduced the first an environmental policy to make sure that the company and its co-workers take environmental responsibility for all activities conducted within its business. Anders Dahlvig replaced Anders Moberg and became the President and CEO of the IKEA Group. In 2000, IKEA realised how Internet was important and introduced its customers e-shopping in Sweden and Denmark. Since then many IKEA stores launched online shopping in many other countries.
Ingvar Kamprad has been married twice. His first wife was Kerstin Wadling who born him a daughter, Annika Kihlbom. However, it was his second wife Margaretha Kamprad-Stennert who helped him to fulfill the dream of IKEA. His wife passed away due to an undisclosed disease in 2011 at the age of 71. She born him three sons: Peter, Jonas and Mathias.
Further history of IKEA can not be called cloudless as there are many competitors such as Argos (Italy), Ilva (Denmark) and others. But Ingvar Kamprad knows that his stores offer customers everything essential where they can get visual and tactile sensations and the real pleasure of being there. Ingvar Kamprad net worth is $3.3 Billion as of March 2013. The current IKEA Group’s President and CEO is Peter Agnefjäll, who was assigned on this position on September 1, 2013 and who gained deep and broad knowledge, experience from IKEA.
We hope you have enjoyed reading Ingvar Kamprad biography and fantastic success story of IKEA and it has inspired you to new discoveries and inventions.

Moreover IKEA shows a sales figure of $12 Billion per Annum.
	Kamprad was never been still. From selling matches at the age of ten to scouring the world to enter innovative furniture markets, Kamprad used his time to the best of his abilities. Always search for what is the demand and go for it. Really understanding the demand is an Art.
The legendary Entrepreneur Ingvar Feodar kampard was born on March 30, 1926. Kampard grew up near Agunnaryd, a small farm called Elmtaryd.As a young boy he doesn’t have any boyish attitude of playing or spending parent’s money. Instead he got an innate quality of doing business. 
Kampard’s entrepreneurial drive starts with an incident. When he was young he has get up early to milk the cows with his father, but he was so reluctant to get up early. Their parents always worry about the little kampard’s attitude. “You sleepyhead!” his father would say. “You’ll never make anything of yourself!”. All those things changed when he got an alarm clock on his birthday, “Iam going to change my life”, he said with determination  he set the time for 5.30am .and he removed the off button from the clock.
At an early age of 10 he started his first business, buying matches at wholesale in Stockholm and selling them for small profits to his neighbours, the demand for this type of selling increased so he planned to give some discounts to make his sales bounce high. By studying the potential of the customers he began to sell other products like Seeds, Fish, Pen and Pencil.
When Kamprad was 17 years old, he showed excellent progess in his studies. So his father gave his money for his success in school.As he was very incisive and know what to do with that money he got. He founded his retail business and named it IKEA. The name IKEA was formed from Kamprad's initials (I.K.) plus the first letters of Elmtaryd and Agunnaryd, the farm and village where he grew up. He focused mainly on selling house hold goods like,stationeries,wallets,pens,picture frames.These are the goods that were really on demand at that time. He gave some discounts to his customers to move the goods faster.Kamprad attended all the sales calls single-handedly, without missing them.
In 1945, kamprad’s sales as well as business tactics grew up. He wanted to expand his business further, so he decided to advertise on local Newspapers. This simple decision really brings a positive response from the people, the result he got more sales calls. But this time Kamprad used milk trucks to deliver his goods.So he satisfied more customers by his speedy delivery. Soon in 1947, he included furniture as a major item in his catalogue.
Kamprad’s business doesn’t seem to move smooth after he started selling furniture, it had its tough times and struggles. When kamprad decided to concentrate only on furnitures, he began to get furniture from local manufactures. That time the competition in the furniture market was very high.Kamprad decided to open a furniture showroom at Almbult in 1953.The most interesting thing that people found there was, they can see and touch the furniture before ordering. That gave customer a sense of satisfaction, which made them privileged when they enter IKEA.
	At the Beginning of 1955,the local furniture manufacturers began to boycott with IKEA.The competitiors formed a group among themselves and start giving pressure to Kamprad, to drove him out of business.But the Lion hearted Kamprad doesn’t step back.
The unshakable determination of Kamprad that kindled him to take a decision, which paved a path for  IKEA to start designing and creating furniture of its own.This situation really shows the importance of decision making, which is the key factor of getting success in business.
Kamprad also introduced a classy style of furniture design,”Do it Yourself Kit”, allowing the people to save money and increasing their curiosity to assemble thing at home. This innovative way of packing things made customers to move towards IKEA, because it is very handy, they felt easy to carry. The interesting fact is that most of IKEA’s competitors followed the same technique.
IKEA’s PR manager told the Newspaper,”We will supply you with the design, the inspiration, the basic knowledge and the basic tools, then it is your responsibility is to go home, build it and use it.”. And she continues “it is a kind of philosophy which brings self-satisfaction”. This is one of the success factors of IKEA, to understand the customer and giving the best of what they deserve.
When anyone who doesn’t know Kamprad, meeting him for the first time, I bet, nobody will believe he is a billionaire.Kamprad can be seen in public transports so often.He always says,” If there is such a thing as good leadership, it is to give a good example”. Simply Kamprad Preaches what he practices. In one of his books, he wrote     “How the hell can I ask people who work for me to travel cheaply if I am traveling in luxury?”. Truly he is a man with such an inspiring attitude, which brings him the real success.
Now IKEA stores spread all over the world in 31 countries, with a man-power of 75,000 employees. The man who stands behind the success of IKEA is really a simple man. Even though he can enjoy a life of luxury, he seldom, does it .When kamprad appeared in a  TV interview all people came to know that, he still drives a 15 years old Volvo, always flies  in economy class.Even in is office he encourage his employee to write both sides of a paper. From this we can understand his prudence in avoiding wastage.
One may ask why Kamprad spend so much time and energy, to maximize his business? He is man who lives for his vision, which has no limits. He once said to is employees,”We have to still develop IKEA group, we need billions of Swiss francs to take on China or Russia.” I think the spirit of achieving was weaved through every fibre of his being.
In his auto-biography kamprad revealed that he attended some pro-Nazi meetings in his youth, he regrets, and call it as the greatest mistake of his life. He also regrets as a recovering alcoholic.A pure and a daring heart can be able to apologize for his mistakes publicly.
Kamprad is a well-known philanthropist. He owns INGKA holdings, the parent company of all IKEA stores. This charitable foundation was reported by the business newspaper “The Economist” in May 2006 as the world’s wealthiest charity. With an estimated value of US$ 36 Billion. He is the chairman of the charity.
A company that feels it has reached its goal will quickly stagnate and lose its vitality. It not only important to get succeeded. But to maintain the success state that we have achieved is the real Himalayan task. Kampard said recently, Now, he is 80 years old, I don’t know what to do at this age, the only work that I know – is making furnitures.That is the spirit of man who revolutionized the furniture world.
