Rachel Anne Maddow (i/ˈmædoʊ/, rhymes with shadow;[2] born April 1, 1973) is an American television host, political commentator, and author.[3][4] She hosts a nightly television show, The Rachel Maddow Show, on MSNBC.[5] Her syndicated talk radio program of the same name aired on Air America Radio. Maddow is the first openly gay anchor to host a major prime-time news program in the United States.[6][7][8][9] She holds a doctorate in politics from Oxford University.
Asked about her political views by the Valley Advocate, Maddow replied, "I'm undoubtedly a liberal, which means that I'm in almost total agreement with the Eisenhower-era Republican party platform."[10]
Maddow was born in Castro Valley, California. Her father, Robert B. "Bob" Maddow, is a former United States Air Force captain who resigned his commission the year before her birth and found civilian work as a lawyer for the East Bay Municipal Utility District. Her mother, Elaine Maddow (née Gosse), is a school program administrator.[11][12][13] She has one older brother, David. Her paternal grandfather was from an Eastern European Jewish family (the original family surname being "Medwedof"), while her paternal grandmother was of Dutch (Protestant) background; her mother, originally from Newfoundland, Canada, is of English and Irish ancestry.[14] Maddow has stated that her family is "very, very Catholic", and she grew up in a community that her mother has described as "very conservative."[15][16][17] Maddow was a competitive athlete and played three sports in high school: volleyball, basketball, and swimming.[18] Referencing John Hughes films, she has described herself as being "a cross between the jock and the antisocial girl" in high school.[17]
A graduate of Castro Valley High School[19] in Castro Valley, California, she attended Stanford University. While a freshman, she was outed by the college newspaper when an interview with her was published by the student newspaper before she could tell her parents.[20] Maddow earned a degree in public policy at Stanford in 1994.[21] At graduation she was awarded the John Gardner Fellowship.[22] She was also the recipient of a Rhodes Scholarship and began her postgraduate study in 1995 at Lincoln College, Oxford. This made her the first openly gay or lesbian American to win an international Rhodes Scholarship.[23] In 2001, she earned a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) in politics at Oxford University.[24] Her thesis is titled HIV/AIDS and Health Care Reform in British and American Prisons and her supervisor was Dr. Lucia Zedner.
Maddow's first radio hosting job was at WRNX (100.9 FM) in Holyoke, Massachusetts, then home to, "The Dave in the Morning Show". She entered and won a contest the station held to find a new sidekick for the show's host, Dave Brinnel.[25] She went on to host Big Breakfast on WRSI, in Northampton, Massachusetts, for two years. She left the show in March 2004 to join the new Air America.[24] There she hosted Unfiltered along with Chuck D (of the hip hop group Public Enemy) and Lizz Winstead (co-creator of The Daily Show), until its cancellation in March 2005.[26] Two weeks after the cancellation of Unfiltered in April 2005, Maddow's weekday two-hour radio program, The Rachel Maddow Show, began airing; in March 2008 it gained an hour, broadcasting from 6 to 9 p.m. EST with David Bender filling in the third hour for the call-in section, when Maddow was on TV assignment. In September 2008, the show's length returned to two hours when Maddow began a nightly MSNBC television program. In February 2009, after renewing her contract with Air America, Maddow returned to the 5 a.m. hour-long slot.[27] Her last Air America show was on January 21, 2010,[citation needed] two weeks before its owners filed for bankruptcy.[28]
In June 2005, Maddow became a regular panelist on MSNBC's Tucker.[29] During and after the November 2006 election, she was a frequent guest on CNN's Paula Zahn Now; she was also a correspondent for The Advocate Newsmagazine, an LGBT-oriented short-form newsmagazine for Logo deriving from news items published by The Advocate. In January 2008, Maddow became an MSNBC political analyst and was a regular panelist on MSNBC's Race for the White House with David Gregory and MSNBC's election coverage,[30] as well as a frequent contributor on Countdown with Keith Olbermann.[24]
In April 2008, Maddow was the substitute host for Countdown with Keith Olbermann, her first time hosting a program on MSNBC. Maddow described herself on air as "nervous." Keith Olbermann complimented her work, and she was brought back to host Countdown the next month. The show she hosted was the highest rated news program among people aged 25 to 54, a key demographic in ratings.[31] For her success, the next Monday, Olbermann ranked Maddow third in his show's segment "World's Best Persons".[32] In July 2008, while Olbermann was on vacation, Maddow filled in again for several broadcasts and, on July 21, for half the show.[33] Maddow also filled in for David Gregory as host of Race for the White House.[24]
Olbermann began to push for Maddow to get her own show at MSNBC, and he was eventually able to persuade Phil Griffin to give her Dan Abrams' time slot. A fan and friend of Maddow's, Olbermann was able to use his influence, which had become greater as his ratings rose.[34]
In August 2008, MSNBC announced The Rachel Maddow Show would replace Verdict with Dan Abrams in the network's 9 p.m. slot the following month.[35][36] Following its debut, the show topped Countdown as the highest rated show on MSNBC on several occasions.[37][38] After being on air for more than a month, Maddow's program doubled the audience that hour.[39] This show made Maddow the first openly gay or lesbian host of a prime-time news program in the United States.[40]
Early reviews for the show were mostly positive. Los Angeles Times writer Matea Gold stated Maddow "finds the right formula on MSNBC,"[41] and The Guardian writes Maddow has become the "star of America's cable news."[42] Associated Press columnist David Bauder said she's "[Keith] Olbermann's political soul mate" and the Olbermann-Maddow shows are a "liberal two-hour block."[43]
Maddow has been profiled in People,[44] The Guardian,[45] and The New York Observer,[46] has appeared on The View and Charlie Rose.[47]
A 2011 Hollywood Reporter profile of Maddow said that she was able to deliver news "with agenda, but not hysteria."[48] A Newsweek profile noted that, "At her best, Maddow debates ideological opponents with civility and persistence... But for all her eloquence, she can get so wound up ripping Republicans that she sounds like another smug cable partisan." The Baltimore Sun critic David Zurawik has accused Maddow of acting like 'a lockstep party member.'"[49] Maddow has likewise been criticized by the editors of The New Republic for her program, which they called "A textbook example of the intellectual limitations of a perfectly settled perspective."[50] On awarding the Interfaith Alliance's Faith and Freedom Award named for Walter Cronkite, Rev. Dr. C Welton Gaddy remarked that "Rachel's passionate coverage of the intersection of religion and politics exhibits a strong personal intellect coupled with constitutional sensitivity to the proper boundaries between religion and government.”[51]
A Time profile called her a "whip-smart, button-cute leftie." It said that she radiates an essential decency and suggested that her career rise might signify that "nice is the new nasty."[52]
Distinguishing herself from others on the left, Maddow said she's a "national security liberal" and in a different interview that she's not "a partisan."[53][54] The New York Times called her a "defense policy wonk"[41][53] and Maddow has written Drift: The Unmooring of American Military Power (2012), a book on the role of the military in postwar American politics. During the 2008 presidential election, Maddow did not formally support any candidate. Concerning Barack Obama's candidacy, Maddow said during the primaries, "I have never and still don't think of myself as an Obama supporter, either professionally or actually."[55]
In March 2010, Republican Scott Brown, the junior United States Senator from Massachusetts, speculated that Maddow was going to run against him for his seat in 2012. He used this premise for a fundraising email that read "...The Massachusetts political machine is looking for someone to run against me. And you're not going to believe who they are supposedly trying to recruit — liberal MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow." Maddow said Brown's speculation was false. On her March 23, 2010, TV program, Maddow said, "I have the best job in the world. I am not running for office. Scott Brown didn't ask me if I was running or planning to run for office before he wrote a fundraising letter with my name. No, it's completely made up by him." Despite her comments, the next day Brown continued along the same line, telling a Boston radio station, "Bring her on." To help put an end to the matter, Maddow ran a full-page advertisement in The Boston Globe confirming she was not running, and separately demanded Brown's apology. She added that despite repeated invitations over the months, Brown had refused to appear on her TV program.[56][57][58][59] Ultimately, it was Elizabeth Warren who ran in 2012, defeating Brown.[60]
On December 11, 2013, The Washington Post announced Maddow would write a monthly opinion column for the paper, contributing one article a month over a six-month period.[61]
Maddow lives in Manhattan and western Massachusetts with her partner, artist Susan Mikula.[62][63] The couple met in 1999, when Mikula hired Maddow to do yard work at her home. Maddow was working on her doctoral dissertation at the time.[62] Their first date was at a National Rifle Association "Ladies' Day on the Range" event.[64]
Maddow has dealt with cyclical depression since puberty. In a 2012 interview, she stated, "It doesn't take away from my joy or my work or my energy, but coping with depression is something that is part of the everyday way that I live and have lived for as long as I can remember."[65]
Emmy Award in the Outstanding News Discussion and Analysis category for "The Rachel Maddow Show" episode "Good Morning Landlocked Central Asia!"
Maddow was named in Out magazine's "Out 100" list of the "gay men and women who moved culture" in 2008.[66]
Maddow was voted "Lesbian/Bi Woman of the Year (American)" in AfterEllen's 2008 Visibility Awards.[67]
In 2009, Maddow was nominated for GLAAD's 20th Annual Media Awards for a segment of her MSNBC show, "Rick Warren, Change To Believe In?", in the Outstanding TV Journalism Segment category.[69]
On March 28, 2009, Maddow received a Proclamation of Honor from the California State Senate, presented in San Francisco by California State Senator Mark Leno.[70]
Maddow placed sixth in the "2009 AfterEllen.com Hot 100" list (May 11, 2009)[72] and third in its "2009 Hot 100: Out Women" version.[73]
Maddow was included on a list of openly gay media professionals in The Advocate's "Forty under 40" issue of June/July 2009.[74]
In 1994, Maddow was an Honorable Mention in the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity Prize in Ethics.[75]
In June 2009, Maddow's MSNBC show was the only cable news show nominated for a Television Critics Association award in the Outstanding Achievement in News and Information category.[76]
In March 2010, Maddow won at the 21st Annual GLAAD Media Awards in the category, Outstanding TV Journalism- Newsmagazine for her segment, "Uganda Be Kidding Me".[77]
Maddow was the 2010 commencement speaker and was given an honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) degree at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts in May 2010.[78]
In July 2010, Maddow was presented with a Maggie Award for her ongoing reporting of healthcare reform, the murder of Dr. George Tiller, and the anti-abortion movement.[79]
In August 2010, Maddow won the Walter Cronkite Faith & Freedom Award, which was presented by the Interfaith Alliance.[51] Past honorees included Larry King, Tom Brokaw, and the late Peter Jennings.[51]
In February 2012, Maddow was presented the John Steinbeck Award by the Martha Heasley Cox Center for Steinbeck Studies at San Jose State University.[80]
In December 2012, The audio book version of Maddow's Drift was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album

This week's People magazine features a two-page article with photos (UPDATE: now online) on Rachel Maddow's home life.
Maddow, who splits her time between New York and Western Massachusetts with partner Susan Mikula, talks to the magazine about her relationship, her cooking skills, and why she and Mikula don't have a TV.
"It was very 'Desperate Housewives,'" the MSNBC host joked.  When they first met, neither of them could cook very well, and Maddow still can't (she "still can't cook an egg," the magazine says).  But Mikula has "become an avid home chef," saying they don't exactly live in a "take-out town."
People says that Mikula "loves indulging in girlie accessories like purses" while Maddow claims to "look like a dude."
As for Maddow's famous lack of a television set in the house, Mikula says there is a practical reason for that.
"We realized that the two of us have the TV Disease," she told People.  "Rachel can't have one because she'd watch it all the time!"

Rachel MaddowTV Personality / Radio PersonalityBorn: 1 April 1973Birthplace: Castro Valley, CaliforniaBest known as: The host of TV's The Rachel Maddow ShowRachel Maddow is the host of the MSNBC political and news program The Rachel Maddow Show, where she is a staunch supporter of unions, women's rights, gay rights, and other classic liberal causes. Rachel Maddow was born in California and attended Stanford University, where she got a bachelor's degree in public policy in 1994. She attended Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship, earning a doctorate there in political science in 2001. She made her way into radio, co-hosting for Massachusetts stations WRNX and WRSI before going to work for the fledgling liberal network Air America Radio in 2004. She was a natural at political talk: she had been at Air America a year when she got her own show, also called The Rachel Maddow Show, and its success led to commentating gigs on CNN and other cable channels. She became a full-time political analyst for MSNBC in 2008, and her popularity moved the network to give her her own show. The Rachel Maddow Show launched in September of 2008 and was a fast success, with many fans hailing it as a left-wing antidote to the right-wing commentators of the Fox News Channel. Maddow's persona -- unapologetic, witty, sometimes exasperated -- led The Washington Post to name her a Breakout Star of 2008. Rachel Maddow has been publicly gay since her years at Stanford and remains one of the few openly gay figures in political media. She is the author of the 2012 book Drift: The Unmooring of American Military Power.Extra credit: Rachel Maddow's partner, Susan Mikula, is an artist who shoots photographs with a fuzzy and vaguely painterly feel. "Shooting exclusively with Polaroid films and cameras, Mikula works in available light, and does no cropping or image manipulation after the fact," says her website. They met in 1999 and have lived together since 2000, according to a 2005 article in The Boston Globe.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC. All rights reserved.More on Rachel Maddow from Infoplease:

“Whenever I get booked on the political shows, they always say, ‘We want to bring you in for balance,’ and that always turns out to mean a conservative host, a conservative guest and me.” - Rachel Maddow
                Rachel Maddow is a television and radio host who has become one of the most recognizable political pundits of her generation, thanks primarily to her appearances on several top-rated programs and her work on The Rachel Maddow Show (which is actually two separate entities on radio’s Air America and TV’s MSNBC).            
                Though she’s been out since her teens, Rachel Maddow has managed to keep a very tight lid on her private life -- with one notable exception: Back in 1999, Rachel Maddow took on a job doing yard work for an artist named Susan Mikula, and the two began a relationship shortly after. It’s worth noting, however, that Rachel Maddow has never allowed her sexuality to define her identity or her work, as she possesses an open, surprisingly lighthearted demeanor that ensures she holds appeal for both sexes. And while she’ll probably never be mistaken for a drop-dead gorgeous beauty, Rachel Maddow does come off as a girl-next-door type that one can’t help but relate to -- which has certainly proved instrumental in her on-air accessibility and subsequent success.            
                It’s hard to believe that just 10 years ago, Rachel Maddow was working a series of less-than-intellectually stimulating odd jobs as a means of supporting herself. After landing her first on-air gig in 1999, Rachel Maddow has quickly climbed the ranks within the notoriously cut-throat industry to assume her place as a respected and internationally recognized authority on politics. Aside from the various accomplishments she’s achieved within her field, Rachel Maddow’s impact on gay and lesbian communities the world over can’t be discounted, as her ongoing efforts at raising awareness and ending intolerance have earned her awards and kudos from such organizations as AfterEllen and Out Magazine (with the latter labeling her one of 2008’s Out 100). It’s consequently not surprising to note that Rachel Maddow has been embraced as a role model among gay youths, as she’s achieved the kind of mainstream success that would’ve been unthinkable just a few decades ago.            
                Rachel Anne Maddow was born on April 1, 1973, in Castro Valley, California. Rachel Maddow’s proclivity toward politics and world news was in place from an exceedingly early age, as she would often read the daily paper in its entirety and confront her teachers with incisive questions about current events. She also found time to indulge in a variety of athletic pursuits -- including basketball and swimming -- though a shoulder injury sustained during her final year of high school brought a swift end to her physical pursuits.  After obtaining a bachelor's degree in public policy from Stanford University, Rachel Maddow -- spurred on by her interest in contributing to the gay community -- took on a job as an activist for the AIDS awareness group ACT UP. In 1995, Rachel Maddow became the first openly gay American to win a Rhodes Scholarship, which she used to earn a doctorate in philosophy from Oxford’s Lincoln College. Though she was initially forced to support herself by taking on a series of odd jobs, Rachel Maddow’s longtime passion for news led her to enter (and eventually win) a contest for an on-air personality on Massachusetts’ The Dave in the Morning Show. rachel maddow is the rachel maddow show Over the next few years, Rachel Maddow’s staunchly liberal views proved instrumental in her rise from obscure DJ to recognizable radio personality. Her ever-expanding profile brought her to the attention of executives at the newly created Air America network, where she was hired alongside Chuck D and Lizz Winstead for the station’s morning show. Though the show only lasted about a year, Rachel Maddow was out of work for only two weeks, as the network gave her a daily two-hour program entitled The Rachel Maddow Show on April 14, 2005.  The show, which is devoted primarily to Rachel Maddow’s unique perspective on a variety of pressing political issues, became an instant success for Air America, with the network eventually expanding the program to three hours to capitalize on Rachel Maddow’s burgeoning popularity. In the months following the series’ debut, Rachel Maddow began receiving invites to appear as an on-air contributor on a variety of news-oriented TV shows -- including Paula Zahn Now and Countdown with Keith Olbermann. Rachel Maddow’s obvious comfort in front of the camera ensured that she remained in high demand among executives, and, after filling in regularly for Keith Olbermann on his popular MSNBC show, she was given her own program on the network (which, like its radio counterpart, was titled The Rachel Maddow Show).  The show doubled MSNBC’s ratings for its time slot within just a few days of premiering, which essentially forced Rachel Maddow to cut back her radio show from three to two hours. The MSNBC has cemented Rachel Maddow’s place as a trustworthy and recognizable television pundit, thus placing her side-by-side with such familiar faces as Chris Matthews, Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity.

 In a year bursting with memorable moments in televised political punditry, the first may have come on January 8, when MSNBC commentator Rachel Maddow explained one of the quick-spreading theories behind Hillary Clinton's victory in New Hampshire, a surprise win that had knocked many of Maddow's on-air colleagues on their asses. 
 "You want to know who they're blaming for women voters breaking for Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama?" a delighted Maddow asked co-panelist Pat Buchanan and host Chris Matthews, her eyes flashing. "They're blaming Chris Matthews! People are citing specifically Chris...not only for his own views but also as a symbol of what the mainstream media has done to Hillary Clinton." 
 Matthews sputtered dismissively, but Maddow wasn't done yet. "People feel the media is piling on Hillary Clinton," she said, "and they're coming to her defense with their votes." For Matthews, who'd been enjoying near rapturous pleasure over the presumptive early-season thumping of his personal hobgoblin, there could not have been worse news than that his own commentary might have paved the way for Clinton's triumph. Yet here was just this headline, delivered by Maddow, looking like Sylvester the Cat, practically licking yellow feathers from the corners of her mouth. 
 "I didn't mean it in a mean way at all," says Maddow over breakfast on a summer day many months and many MSNBC promotions away from that indelible January night. "But I knew that it was just going to blow his mind." 
 Matthews is far from the first talking head to get this treatment. Long before this primary season, clips of Maddow, an Air America host often invited on cable news shows as a ballsy gremlin of the left, zipped around the Internet. Her specialty was making Tucker Carlson's head explode, or getting under Buchanan's skin until all he could do was gibber at her about socialism. But presidential election cycles provide the hot klieg lights under which character actors mature into media leading ladies, and at 35, with fewer than five years of national broadcast experience under her belt, Rachel Maddow is the explosive star of the season. She's gone from being a popular guest analyst on MSNBC to an exclusive commentator to a regular guest host for the network's prize pig, Countdown With Keith Olbermann. Now there is increasing clang and clamor over the possibility that she will get her own show on MSNBC.  
 What's remarkable about Maddow's ascension is not its velocity--Hurricane Katrina made Anderson Cooper in less than a week--but the shifts in media it may demarcate. Maddow is one of the few left-liberal women to bust open the world of TV punditry, which has made icons of right-wing commentators like Ann Coulter and Michelle Malkin. Unlike her beautiful, bilious conservative female counterparts or the cocksure boys-on-the-bus analysts, however, Maddow didn't get here by bluster and bravado but with a combination of crisp thinking and galumphing good cheer. Remarkably, this season's discovery isn't a glossy matinee idol or a smooth-talking partisan hack but a PhD Rhodes scholar lesbian policy wonk who started as a prison AIDS activist. 
 All of which raises a crucial question: does Maddow's unlikely success, reliant on her ability to defy cliché and categorization at every turn, signal a move in punditry away from the thuggish and the angry and toward the lucid and sophisticated? Or has her powerful charisma and canny career management allowed her to break the rules--without actually breaking a mold? 
 When we meet, Maddow is halfway through an eight-night stand filling in for a vacationing Olbermann on Countdown, and she is vibrating with energy from the previous evening. She believes she has three distinct responsibilities when subbing: not messing anything up for the show's permanent stewards, keeping Olbermann's ratings high and just being Rachel Maddow. "Trying to do it as if I'm Keith isn't the best way to go," she explains. 
 Maddow fulfilled all three responsibilities in her July stint, showcasing her obvious facility with the medium while putting her own stamp on the program. Nonetheless, she still dwells on her anxieties about the mechanics of hosting--when to look at the camera, when to turn to the script--which she says Olbermann has tutored her on. "It's like rocket science, honestly," she says. "And I feel like I've got a learning curve that's like the Matterhorn! Holy mackerel!" 
 Of course, Olbermann recently told the Kansas City Star that his protégée mastered the technical stuff in about ten minutes, and that on the first night she stepped in for him, she didn't make a single teleprompter mistake, while he averages four or five a night. But Maddow's signature mixture of self-deprecation and gusto, her holy mackerel-ness, is as good a place as any to start thinking about her singular success. Everything about her radiates competence and a deft, bright careerism. She wants to succeed, makes no bones about campaigning for her own television show and yet evinces a regular-person charm and self-doubt that ensures you'll never mistake her ambition for bloodthirst or bullying.  
 Unlike her Air America founding classmates Janeane Garofalo and Al Franken, Maddow is not a professional comedian. Still, it's clear that she finds many of the characters lumbering across the tableau of American politics a total hoot. She finds her own story pretty hilarious, too. Asked if her television career is the culmination of a plotted path, Maddow laughs. "You mean when I started working on AIDS in prisons, was this where I thought it would end up? Yeah. This is pretty much it. Phase forty-seven of my master plan." 
 Maddow grew up in the Bay Area; she came out just before college in 1990 and became an AIDS activist at the epicenter of the epidemic. She earned a degree in public policy from Stanford before beginning work with ACT UP and the AIDS Legal Referral Panel. But Maddow had trouble breaking into treatment activism, which was then the rock-star world of AIDS policy. "It was boys' land," she says. "I knew like two women total who were doing treatment activism. And I didn't totally get it. I'm not like Barbie--'Math is hard!'--but it was a techie world, and I didn't feel like I could be all that helpful." 
 What she discovered instead was the nexus of the radical prison reform movement of the '70s and modern AIDS activism. It was an area where Maddow felt progress--like allowing secure hospices to take dying prisoners--was possible. "Dying behind bars?" she says fourteen years later. "Wicked expensive. And wicked stupid. And also mean. So let's make the hospices get what they want and also do the right thing!" 
 In 1995 Maddow traveled as a Rhodes scholar to Oxford, where she began a doctorate in political science, focusing on the intersection of the AIDS and prison movements. She moved back to the United States to finish her dissertation, crashing with friends in Western Massachusetts. "I wanted to live somewhere where I'd be unhappy," she explains. "And I have no interest in New England, hate winter, don't like the country, not fond of animals." More than a decade later, Maddow still divides her time between her home in Northampton, Massachusetts, and an apartment in Greenwich Village, both of which she shares with her girlfriend, artist Susan Mikula. The couple have been together for almost ten years, and Maddow calls their relationship "my proudest accomplishment." 
 After defending her dissertation, Maddow picked up work on AIDS in prison again, as well as a series of odd jobs, from cleaning buckets at a coffee bean factory to being a handyman who didn't know how to fix anything. As part of her patchwork career, she attended an open audition to replace the "news girl" at the local radio station. She got the job and took a shine to the airwaves. When Air America launched in 2004, Maddow lobbied the network to bring her aboard. It did, hiring her to co-host Unfiltered with Chuck D and Lizz Winstead. When the show was canceled a year later, Maddow got her own two-hour weekday slot. "They had no business hiring me," Maddow says of the flier Air America took on her. "As it turned out, it worked out for them. I mean, I hope it did. I hope they're happy!" 
 Maddow is one of the only original Air Americans to be left standing after the company's rocky four-and-a-half-year history, and her mainstream success is an unqualified victory for the network. If she got plucked away by grabby television hands, it would be a tough loss. "We view her as a homegrown talent," says Air America chairman Charles Kireker, who has run the network since February. "We hope and expect to have her continue hosting a radio show on Air America for a long time." 
 In an e-mail, Maddow confirms her desire to host both a TV and a radio program: "If O'Reilly, Hannity and Beck can do that, so can I." Still, Kireker has reason to be nervous. Calling from the Netroots convention in Austin, he'd just come from a panel during which mention of a still-imaginary Maddow TV show prompted an eruption of applause. "We've seen the potential for greatness in Rachel for years," says Kireker. "What's so remarkable is that now it's coming so quickly. This election cycle has propelled it forward in a meteoric fashion." 
 No kidding. Love is too weak a word to describe how some people feel about Rachel Maddow. They lurve her, loave her, luff her. New York magazine's online Intelligencer column recently ran an item headlined Why We're Gay for Rachel Maddow, and the blogosphere is dotted with posts like "I'm totally gay for Rachel Maddow." The "gay for Rachel" meme appears to transcend gender and sexuality. Women, men, straight and not straight: they're all gay for her. In a year in which we have decided to become postracial and postgender, Maddow may embody a media in which adoring fandom is postgay. 
 That's appropriate, since part of the hypnotic hold Maddow has on her audience is that while she is one of the first fully forged stars of the "liberal media," her commentary is, in a funny way, also postpartisan. During an incendiary primary season, Maddow maintained an almost maddening equilibrium, expressing dismay and appreciation for just about every candidate. She was very hard on Clinton; her face still hardens when she talks about the 3 am red phone ad, which she calls "an abomination," and Clinton's war vote, which she says is "unforgivable." But Maddow also finds herself "frequently underwhelmed" by Obama. "He got it right in opposing the war," she says, "but his war policy stuff now is bullshit. It's total bullshit, and I've never been impressed by it. One or two brigades a month? You want your son to be in the last brigade?" 
 Contrary to widely held opinion, Maddow did not endorse a candidate in the primary. "I have never and still don't think of myself as an Obama supporter, either professionally or actually," says Maddow, adding that she feels "liberated by having a professional role in which it's probably better for me not to take sides."  
 "She is a civics geek," says Vanessa Silverton-Peel, executive producer of The Rachel Maddow Show. "She wants to talk about AIDS in prison and the Constitution and the war in Iraq. Policy is her main focus. Not winning elections."  
 On radio, Maddow starts every day with war news. She focuses hard on policy and on the politics of the absurd. "I'm fascinated by the evil child actor twins that run Poland," she says, as well as inflation in Zimbabwe ("How many bails of hundred-dollar bills does it take to buy bread today in Zimbabwe?"). She's obsessed with the Iraqi national soccer team, librarians and cocktail mixology; she once said that she'd like to "professionally bully people about what they drink." Then there are her specialties: foreign policy, the GI Bill, veterans groups. "That's the most satisfying thing about being able to do my own story selection," she says. "You get to pick that stuff. And whoever is President or in control in Congress is not going to affect that." 
 It's ironic that Maddow, perhaps Air America's most successful product, has traveled through the looking glass of partisan journalism and come out the other side an electoral agnostic, a liberal in the purest, almost mineral sense of the word. She loves the country, loves the Constitution and loves what is moving about politics. A worldview shaped by these concerns, one that maintains a well-manicured distance from electoral Sturm und Drang, could be a powerful asset for Maddow and the rest of the left-leaning media, an inoculation against future tune-out should they get their wish--an Obama administration that could rob them of their fury-fueled audiences.  
 Maddow, who has not owned a TV since 1990, tries to limit her exposure to online and print criticism of herself. If and when she lands her own berth, and with it a nightly viewership unused to seeing a brainy lesbian with rock-solid expertise on military policy or the IAVA, that will become more difficult. She already bristles slightly when talking about how she gets all the girl questions. "I love the idea that I am the voice of woman," she says, gesturing at her T-shirt, baggy jeans and Red Sox cap. "Look at me. It's like: really? The one woman in the room is really mannish." In real life, as advertised on her website, Maddow dresses "like a first-grader" and hypothesizes that her mild androgyny might have greased her infiltration of boyworld punditry. "I look like a dude," she says. Of course, for her television gigs, Maddow gets coiffed and painted and dressed up in what she calls "lady clothes" to fit a more traditional bill, a process she says she used to "resist and get angsty about," but to which she has now surrendered. 
 When I ask whether some of her signature habits--the fascination with the evil twin Polish dictators, the obsession with the nuts and bolts of foreign policy--will go the way of her chunky glasses and naked lips, she balks. "The only reason I get these opportunities is because of my sensibility," she says. "I'm not being invited to do these things because of my looks or my facility with language. What they're after is the thing you're saying I have to trade off." 
 She continues, "My instinct sometimes is to trade it off. Like, 'Oh, I'm in the big leagues now so I better dial it back. But they don't want it dialed back. They are booking me or asking me to host because they like what they see."
