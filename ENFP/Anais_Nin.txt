Known for: novels, published diariesOccupation: writerDates: February 21, 1903 - January 14, 1977Full birth name: Angela Anais Juana Antolina Rosa Edelmira Nin y Culmell
Anais Nin was born in France. Her father was the composer Joaquin Nin, who grew up in Spain but was born in and returned to Cuba. Her mother, Rosa Culmell y Vigaraud, was of Cuban, French, and Danish ancestry. Anais Nin moved to the United States in 1914 after her father deserted the family. In the United States she attended Catholic schools, dropped out of school, worked as a model and dancer, and returned to Europe in 1923.
Anais Nin studied psychoanalysis with Otto Rank and briefly practiced as a lay therapist in New York. She studied the theories of Carl Jung for a time as well.
Finding it difficult to get her erotic stories published, Anais Nin helped found Siana Editions in France in 1935. By 1939 and the outbreak of World War II she returned to New York, where she became a figure in the Greenwich Village crowd.
An obscure literary figure for most of her life, when her journals -- kept since 1931 -- began to be published in 1966, Anais Nin entered the public eye. The ten volumes of The Diary of Anaïs Nin have remained popular. These are more than simple diaries; each volume has a theme, and were likely written with the intent that they later be published. Letters she exchanged with intimate friends, including Henry Miller, have also been published. The popularity of the diaries brought interest in her previously-published novels. The Delta of Venus and Little Birds, originally written in the 1940s, were published after her death (1977, 1979).
Anais Nin is known, as well, for her lovers, who included Henry Miller, Edmund Wilson, Gore Vidal and Otto Rank. She was married to Hugh Guiler of New York who tolerated her affairs. She also entered into a second, bigamous marriage to Rupert Pole in California. She had the marriage annulled about the time she was achieving more widespread fame. She was living with Pole at the time of her death, and he saw to the publication of a new edition of her diaries, unexpurgated.
The ideas of Anais Nin about "masculine" and "feminine" natures have influenced that part of the feminist movement known as "difference feminism." She disassociated herself late in her life from the more political forms of feminism, believing that self-knowledge through journaling was the source of personal liberation.

Anais Nin was a French-Cuban writer who became famous for her erotic literature, short stories and journals and lived in the United States till her death. Read this brief biography to know more about her life.
place of death: Los Angeles, California father: Joaquin Nin  mother: Rosa Culmell siblings: Joaquin Nin-Culmell, Thorvald  Spouses: Rupert Pole (m. 1955–1966), Hugh Parker Guiler (m. 1923–1977)
Anais Nin was a renowned writer who is famous for her journals written for a period spanning six decades. Nin was born French-Cuban but lived in the United States in her later years of life till she died. Nin's works revolved around accounts of her relationships with authors, artists, psychoanalysts, and other figures. Her journals spoke of life and its balancing acts. Much of Nin's written works have been published after her death. Nin is hailed as a great erotic literature writer and some of her notable and popular works are "Delta of Venus", "Little Birds" and "Henry and June". Nin was known to have a male mindset and had sexual relations with men and women whom she portrayed in her novels and journals which were works of fiction and reality. Some of her journals include "A Cafe in Space", "the Anais Nin Literary Journal" which are being brought recently which also include "Anais Nin and Joaquín Nin y Castellanos: Prelude to a SymphonyLetters between a father and daughter". Nin had been a visiting lecturer in several colleges and given a fine impetus to the feminist movement with her strong writings. Some of her writings were made into films and she was also portrayed in a feature length film made by Maria de Medeiros.
Anais Nin was born as Angela Anaïs Juana Antolina Rosa Edelmira Nin y Culmell on 21 February 1903 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France to artistic parents. Nin’s father Joaquín Nin was a Spanish artist and a composer who lived in Cuba where he met Nin’s mother Rosa Culmell of French and Danish descent who was a well trained professional classical singer based in Cuba. As a child Nin was brought up in Spain. Her parents separated and Nina along with her two brothers, Thorvald Nin and Joaquin Nin-Culmell were moved to New York City from Barcelona by their mother.
Nin received her formal education till the age of 16 when she decided to give up studying and started to work as a dancer and model. After living in America for a long time Nin nearly forgot how to speak Spanish which is why she kept her French and English fluency.
Nin got married to her first husband, Hugh Parker Guiler on 3 March 1923 in Havana, Cuba. Her husband was a banker and an artist who made experimental films in the later years and was known as Ian Hugo in the late 1940s. In 1924 Nin and Hugh moved to Paris where Hugh continued with his banking career and Nin started writing and even trained as a flamenco dancer in Paris in the mid-to-late 1920s. Nin wrote her first book in print, “D. H. Lawrence: An Unprofessional Study” which was published by Edward W. Titus in Paris, 1932. Nin is believed to have taken just 16 days to complete her book on D. H. Lawrence. During this period Nin deeply immersed herself into exploration in the felid of psychotherapy, studying under the likes of Otto Rank who was a disciple of Sigmund Freud. Nin had briefly been a patient of Carl Jung. On the onset of 1939 Nin left Paris as it was a French government’s request to its residents to leave France because of the upcoming war. Nin returned to New York with Hugh during this time and sent her written books to Frances Steloff of the Gotham Book Mart in New York for safekeeping.
Nin had written diaries, Vol.1, 1931–1934 which suggest her close bonding with Henry Miller with whom she probably shared a bohemian life. Her diaries however do not have any mention of her husband in the published edition of the 1930s parts of her diary (Vol.1–2). However, the opening of Vol.1 makes it clear that she is married and the introduction also points to the fact that her husband Guiler had refused to be included or mentioned in the published diaries.
Nin met former actor Rupert Pole in a Manhattan elevator on her way to a party in 1947 when she was 44 years old. The duo soon started dating and started living in. On March 17, 1955, she married Pole at Quartzsite, Arizona and returned with him to live in California. Nin’s first husband Guiler stayed back in New York unaware of her marriage which he came to know only after Nin died in 1977. In 1966 Nin had to get into an annulment of her marriage with Pole because of legal problems arising out of the fact that both Guiler and Pole were claiming her as a dependent on their federal tax returns. In spite of Nin’s marriage with Pole being annulled she continued living with Pole until her death in 1977.
Nin is better known as a person who recorded everything in her diaries. She had written journals for decades which give all the insight into her life, relationships and times. Nin is popular as an author even today and she is regarded as one of finest erotic literature writers of all times. In an unpublished 1940 diary Nin confirms that she was not a bisexual, although she might have been attracted to women but thoughts on sexual acts with women made her uncomfortable.
Nin discussed many of her personal struggles and journeys and while doing so she revealed that many literary figures had been her friends and lovers. Some of them are Henry Miller, Antonin Artaud, Edmund Wilson, Gore Vidal, James Agee, James Leo Herlihy, and Lawrence Durrell. Nin had a love affair with Miller who shaped Nin as a woman and an author.
It was in 1931-1932 that Nin had written her book “Henry and June: From the Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin” (full title - Henry and June: From A Journal of Love: the Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin) which was published much later in 1986. The book was published with parts and sections taken from Nin’s unpublished diaries. The book revolves around first volume of Anaïs Nin's published diaries and discussion of Nin's sex life and is full of her struggles and passionate relationship with husband Hugo, and then, as the novel/memoir progresses, other lovers. Miller’s wife was June who was considered a femme fatale was gifted with money, jewelry and clothes by Nin which often left Nin with no money. All this aroused questions about Nin’s sexual preferences. But Nin cleared all doubts by stating that she did not have any kind of sexual relations with Miller’s wife. In the book Nin was moved by June’s powerful persona. Nin stated, “I have become June” but made it clear that she did not consummate her erotic feelings for her.
Nin wrote her second unexpurgated journal “Incest” which talked about her having an incestuous relationship with her father, which was also graphically described in pages 207–15. In 1936 Nin published “House of Incest” which was a 72 page novel that was her first work of fiction. In the book Nin did not deal with stories about her love life but she narrated a beautiful surrealistic look within the narrator's subconscious mind as she attempts to escape from a dream in which she is trapped, or according to Nin, as she attempts to escape from “the woman's season in hell.”
Nin had appeared and been a part of various films. She first appeared in the Kenneth Anger film “Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome” (1954) as Astarte, Maya Deren film “Ritual in Transfigured Time” (1946); and in “Bells of Atlantis” (1952) and in a film by her husband Guiler.
In the 1960s feminist movement had become prominent and Nin’s writings featured feminist perspectives during this time. Soon she became a popular lecturer at various universities and at the same time she detached herself from all political activities. In 1973 Anaïs Nin was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Philadelphia College of Art. In 1974 Nin was elected to the United States National Institute of Arts and Letters.

I stumbled upon Anaïs Nin in college while killing time at a Borders before a date.  Her diaries were sitting in the "literature" section and I couldn't quite understand why.  I pulled Volume I off the shelf, and thinking to myself: "Why would I want to read the diaries of someone??", I opted instead, for Ladders To Fire.  I was instantly smitten.  In the next week, I'd inhaled House of Incest, A Spy In The House Of Love and Little Birds.  It was Anaïs, through Henry and June that introduced me to Henry Miller, and the Tropics books, two of my all-time favorites INTHEWHOLEWORLDFOREVERANDEVERAMEN.  For as much as I loved her writing, I never knew very much about her at all.  A couple of years back, I stumbled upon what is commonly known as the definitive biography on her life in a Half Price Books in Seattle.  I snatched up Bair's work for a song, and placed it on my shelf to get around to at a later date.  That later date was a couple of weeks ago, as I sat proctoring standardized tests.  I was amazed at the woman I'd known nothing about.  She was a completely different person than what I'd envisioned, and not necessarily in the best of ways.  I felt rather a fool for having idolized her for so long without an inkling of the type of troubled inner life that birthed such personal writing.  Anaïs Nin was a narcissist and lived in a fantasy world created by her constant revisions of facts and occurrences.  As I read the biography, I found myself a bit sickened and almost aghast at the life she lived and the way she treated those in it.  Bair shed a light where previously I'd been blissfully ignorant, laying out the facts for Anaïs' fantasies and dispelling many of the stories told in the diaries.  I know now why those diaries were found in the literature section; they were a meticulous retelling…the edited and polished attempt of a woman to lay out "the perfect life" before her readers.  Bair tells a balanced story, getting as many points of view as possible wherever there are conflicting stories.  Some have indicated that her telling seems to be biased.  I'm not sure how to answer that.  She certainly did not favor Nin by sugar-coating the truths she found, but she seemed fair to me in her attempts to ferret out all sides of each story.  I was pleased with the way this life was told.  Never cumbersome, the bio read easily and understandably.  It's a definite must for anyone who loves Nin's work as much as I have, or even for those who wish to be astounded by an unorthodox and fanciful woman trying to find her way in a world that didn't really want her.

I find Bair's take on Anais Nin's life to be oddly judgmental; a curious scolding condescension runs through the text of this biography.  Yes, Nin may have been a narcissist, but Bair portrays her literally as a spoiled brat, sexually immature, emotionally manipulative, and without ethics.  Even worse, Bair writes about Nin's work without any sympathy or sense of Nin's quite unique contribution to literary modernism.  Particularly now that reflexivity is so common in fiction writing, one thinks tha...more

Even worse, Bair writes about Nin's work without any sympathy or sense of Nin's quite unique contribution to literary modernism.  Particularly now that reflexivity is so common in fiction writing, one thinks that more intellectual curiosity might be directed towards Nin's relentless and fantastical quest to understand and express herself, the great effort of the diaries, whether they are factual or not, whether history has found Nin to be a "minor" writer or not.  Bair's work verges on the anti-feminist, I think.(less)
It was frightening to see so much of myself in young Nin, mostly the undesirable parts.  "The idea of relativity makes many people fearful- the idea that you are one person with me today and another person with someon else later." Anaïs Nin said this in an 1971 interview. xvAnaïs said a lifetime of diary writing had been, from the first moment she wrote about herself, a concession "that life would be more bearable if I looked at it as an adventure and a tale.

Anais Nin is one of my favorite authors, but after 500 pages, even I was a little sick of her. I got the impression that so was the author, at times - which is okay, because Anais herself was not always a nice or kind person. She was often self-centered, jealous, petty, and devious.Anais was also incredibly talented, when she wasn't getting in her own way, and generous with her lovers (even if it was her husband's money she was sharing) and her work.A very complicated woman, who did track her li...more

(Some went to far as to dub them "liaries.") Anais was the ultimate unreliable narrator, and each person in her life heard different stories from her, often a mixture of truth and lies. Trying to untangle it and put together a reasonable narrative of what Anais was doing, saying, and why, is really an incredible work.As mentioned, it is quite long - but it needed to be, to cover the lifespan of a woman who lived over 70 years and juggled husbands, lovers, and a writing and speaking career.(less)
The thing I like about Anais Nin above all else is that she formed powerful connections to people and used them as catalysts.  People, for Nin, seemed to be transformative elements through which she floated and morphed, giving her what she liked the most:  a reason to write about herself.  When I read this book, my first reaction was distaste.  Having handed over most of The Tropic of Cancer to Henry Miller and asking for none of the glory, I saw her as a weak-minded, needy woman who had no courage....more

People, for Nin, seemed to be transformative elements through which she floated and morphed, giving her what she liked the most:  a reason to write about herself.  When I read this book, my first reaction was distaste.  Having handed over most of The Tropic of Cancer to Henry Miller and asking for none of the glory, I saw her as a weak-minded, needy woman who had no courage.  However, the more I began to read about her and about her diaries, I realized that all Nin ever wanted was a contrast, something that could give her psyche a canvas.  She wanted to paint herself everyday, all of the time.  It is rare to get a glimpse into an extremely overdeveloped feminine ego.  This book is that chance.   (less)
This is an excellent biography. I would read any by this author. And what a complicated woman Nin was...full of art, artifice & deception. Did you know she had 2 husbands, one on each coast? One knew about the other, but the other did not...fascinating. I once wrote a long response to this book, which also covered my relat. to Nin (I devoured her as a high schooler); unfortunately it was handwritten in a favorite notebook which I lost on a Mexico City subway...
 Deirdre Bair is a genius. I read this in the stairwells of my high school when I was 14 during lunch. I fell very much in love w/ the graceful complications of this woman. The index card box she had to keep track of her complicated lies was so fascinating. She's so buckled-up & yet she oozes these sensuous stories out onto the page. Deirdre Bair, if anyone should be trusted w/ the sacred documents amounting to someone's entire existence, it is you.
Bair honestly and sympathetically sorts through what Nin writes in her journals and reconciles it with Nin's life. Although Nin's journals have been referred to as the "Liaries" since she revised them often and withheld information to protect her husband from her bigamy, Bair presents a vulnerable, understandable woman who is trying to find a culture to which she belongs. Intriguing and dark, this book is worth reading.
Liked the writing, very thorough...but Nin was like a beautiful train wreck, you can't believe what you're reading and want to look away so badly but just can't seem to do it.
Incredibly well written biography of an incredibly messed up, narcissistic, untruthful, nymphomaniacal writer :) No, don't get me wrong, I fell in love with Nin by reading this biography. She was so crazy that you'd either have to love her or hate her. I could never hate anyone who was so alive and so wildly creative, even if she chanelled this creativity more into her superbly complex life and therefore less into her art. Still, even though she was not the greatest writer, she will always be re...more

I could never hate anyone who was so alive and so wildly creative, even if she chanelled this creativity more into her superbly complex life and therefore less into her art. Still, even though she was not the greatest writer, she will always be rememebered as a "great minor writer". And Bair is a great biographer.(less)
A frank, sometimes brutal biography of Anais Nin.  Dierdre Bair is not sympathetic in any way, but shows you everything, warts and all...not hesitating to make clear her approval or disapproval of certain events and decisions in Anais's life.  Still, this is a captivating read, and should be the first choice outside of Anais's own (unexpurgated) diaries and books for you to seek out if you want to know more about her.  Highly recommended.
So here's the thing: Do I rate this book according to how well it was written, or how absolutely disgusted I was to learn about the even more sordid details of Nin's life & character? I'll go with the latter. Reading this book, for me, was like discovering your favorite superhero can't fly. I was so upset I couldn't even finish it.
Anais Nin led a strange life! Stranger than I had imagined when watching the movie, Henry & June, so many years ago. Her fiction was too exasperating for me to read. I always got the feeling she had just downed some absinthe and could not figure out what she was trying to say. The biography was more intersting.
Not really an academic critical analysis of Nin's life and work nor a biography written in a way to engage the lay reader; this book somehow fell between two genres. However the life of Nin, bizarre, deceitful and self-absorbed is interesting enough and annoying enough to want to get to the end.
The biography is well written. The author did a great job. That being said...I found Nin very narcissistic and because of it a "one" dimensional diminishing being. I could not help but feel pity for the Femme Fatale. 
Reading about Anaïs Nin certainly is a lot more enjoyable than reading the stuff Anaïs Nin wrote. What an insane and fascinating woman she was. 
Initially read this when I was 11.  Along with another that..THE PEARL!   Such saucy talk for the perverted authors of the 1600's

=======================================================
Anaïs Nin was a part French part Cuban author born on 21st February 1903 in Neuilly, France. Born in a family where art was wholeheartedly appreciated, Nin began writing when she was very young. She never gained any formal education after the age of sixteen when she left school and worked as a model for an artist until her mother moved her to New York City where Nin spent most of her time writing her diaries. She got married to her first husband Ian Hugo (Hugh Parker Guiller) in March 1923 and moved to Paris the next year.
Her diaries Vol.1, 1931–1934 tell us about her intimate relationship with Henry Miller, an American writer and painter. Her husband did not want to become a part of these diaries so he is not mentioned anywhere in them, but Nin was a part of Ian’s film ‘Bells of Atlantis’ (1952). At the age of 44 she met the actor Rupert Pole and developed a passionate romantic relationship with him that ended in marriage in March 1955. Her first husband was completely unaware of Nin’s marriage to Pole. This ‘bicoastal trapeze’ led to Nin leading two lives which revolved around lies. The following statement by Nin shows us how confusing her life had become. “I tell so many lies I have to write them down and keep them in the lie box so I can keep them straight.” After some legal issues that arose due to claims by Pole and Guiller as having her as a dependent on their tax returns, the marriage between Nin and Pole had to be annulled. Despite the end of their marriage, they continued to live together till her death.
All these incidences were mentioned in her diaries, and that is what Nin is known best for. Her journals provide us with a deep understanding of her personal life. Pole, Guiller and Miller were not her only lovers. She was involved with several other men, all of them prominent authors or important figures. She is also popular for her erotic novels and was one of the very few women in the modern West who authored erotica. Her famous novels of this nature were published in the 1970s. These include ‘Delta of Venus’ and ‘Little Birds’. Nin was thought to be bisexual because of her ‘ménage à trois’ between her, Henry Miller and his wife June Mansfield Miller, although she completely denies this claim.
Some of Nin’s novels are ‘Under a Glass Bell’ (1944), ‘Seduction of the Minotaur’ (1958), ‘In Favor of a Sensitive Man’ (1976) and ‘Waste of Timelessness: And Other Early Stories’ that she wrote in 1932, but was published posthumously.
Anaïs Nin took part in some of the most remarkable literary movements and artistic engagements that happened in the 20th century. These include the ‘surrealist movements’ of the 1930s and the 1940s, the ‘Avant Garde’ crowd, and the feminist movement in the 1960s. She was awarded with an honorary doctorate degree from ‘Philadelphia College of Art’, appreciating her contributions to English Literature.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Anaïs Nin was born February 21, 1903 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris, France. She moved to the United States in 1914 with her mother, singer Rosa Culmell and two brothers, Thorvald and Joaquin. Her father was Joaquin Nin, a Spanish pianist and composer, who abandoned the family after leaving his family at various intervals in his career to tour Europe and Cuba, when Nin was eleven. Shortly afterward, on the boat Monserrat, Nin began her childhood diary, "Linotte", written as an extended letter to her papa.Anaïs wanted to be an artist from the very moment she could speak. She loved books, stories, artists, musicians, fine music, good food, and grew accustomed to being surrounded by the sounds of late night bohemian laughter from her parents dinner parties heard from the downstairs parlor before the two were separated. Anaïs was a model for her father's early photographs at this time and used to steal into his study when he was away and read all his books voraciously. She was seriously ill as a child and nearly died twice from various internal organ afflictions. If not for a kind Belgian couple and the care of three Belgian nurses, Anaïs Nin might never have made the impact on literature and the feminist movement that she did later on in life, from her work spanning her Diaries written in the the tumultuous 30's to her eventual critical success in the socially aware 60s and 70s.In New York, Anaïs loved writing in her diary, dreaming, philosophizing, and recording her thoughts and reflections as she grew into a beautiful young woman with grand dreams and a host of insecurities. She had an active imagination and preferred rainy days of reading curled up with a wonderful book or her diary at the little windowsill seat - and she loved to dance and had a connection to nature heavily influenced by poets like Byron, Blake and the New England Transcendentalists. Her Catholic faith wavered in and out due to philosophical doubts about the meaning of life and suffering, caused by her anguish over her beloved war torn France and the deep rift felt inside her since being uprooted.After living in New York for nine years, at twenty Anaïs married Hugh Guiler (later known as engravist and filmmaker of "Bells of Atlantis" and "Jazz of lights" Ian Hugo), a banker in the twenties and thirties, and moved back to Paris with him. Nin began writing short stories (later published as Waste of Timelessness) with publication in mind, but felt torn between her duties as a conservative banker's wife and her desire for artistic expression. Nevertheless, it was around this time that Nin published her first work, D. H. Lawrence: An Unprofessional Study (1932), which was well-received.Then she met self proclaimed gangster-poet 'Henry Miller'(I), a struggling Brooklyn writer in Paris, through her lawyer. Miller and especially his wife, the mythic June Mansfield Miller, enchanted Anaïs by their 'hard' bohemian living and their associations with the crème de la crème of Paris' underbelly (including actor and creator of theatre de cruelte, Antonin Artaud).She became deeply influenced by writers like Lawrence, Proust, and in particular Djuna Barnes' novel Nightwood. Nin channeled her evolving psycho-sexual impressions of the vicious circle/love triangle between her, Henry and June into the surrealistic prose-poem House of Incest and in her Diaries. She also worked along her compatriots on a dollar a page erotica, later the poetic, emotive bestselling Delta of Venus and Little Birds.In the mid-to-late 1930s, Nin, Miller, Lawrence Durell and other writers in the Villa Seurat circle who experienced difficulty finding publishers founded Siana Editions (Anais spelled backwards!) to publish their own works. Nin in particular could find no one to publish House of Incest (1936) or Winter of Artifice. In 1939 these books were well-received in Europe. However, when Anaïs eventually moved back to New York City in 1939 with her husband, she found American publishers and the average reading public closed off to her work. Miller achieved critical and commercial success decades before Nin, despite her initial efforts to edit, support and publish him along with her own work. After several years of trying to place her works with American publishers, Nin bought a second-hand printing press with a loan from Bookseller and founder of New York's famed Gotham Book Mart and with the help of Anaïs' latest paramour, Peruvian political activist Gonzalo More, she began to typeset and print her own books. Nin's work eventually caught the attention of critic Edmund Wilson, who praised her writing and helped her on the road to obtaining an American publisher.It was Nin's Diary, however, that brought her the greatest success and critical acceptance that she was to receive. Nin never intended the two hundred manuscript volumes for publication, and many, including Miller, Rank, Alfred Perles, Durrel and Allendy, tried to convince Anaïs that her obsessive diary writing was destroying her chance at writing the great American novel. However Nin decided she had to "go her own way, the woman's way" and continue her lifelong odyssey of self exploration and reflection through the Diaries. To reconcile fiction and fact Nin eventually began rewriting diary entries into her fiction and vice versa, protecting those who wanted to maintain their privacy (usually lovers) while still writing in her preferred medium.Nin was involved in the some of the most interesting literary and artistic movements of the 20th century including the outskirts of Paris' 1920's Lost Generation, the psychoanalytic and surrealist movements of the 30s and 40s, the Beat movement of the 50s in Greenwich Village, the avant garde crowd in 60s California and the women's movement of the 70's. She maintained relationships (and kept two bi-coastal "husbands" in the later part of her life) with many vital artists and writers over her lifespan and was in great demand as a lecturer at universities across the United States until she died of cancer in 1977.
      She was very close with author Henry Miller and put a great deal of time and effort into finding a publisher for his novel, Tropic of Cancer.
      In 1935, she helped establish the publishing house Siana Editions because no one would publish her writings, which were deeply intimate and erotic.
      We don't have a language for the senses. Feelings are images, sensations are like musical sounds.
      Ordinary life does not interest me. I seek only the high moments. I am in accord with the surrealists, searching for the marvelous.
      Throw your dreams into space like a kite, and you do not know what it will bring back, a new life, a new friend, a new love, or a new country.
      On personal power: I will not be a tourist in the world of images, just watching images passing by which I cannot live in, make love to, possess as permanent source of joy and ecstasy.
      On mothering: I know why families were created, with all their imperfections. They humanize you. They are made to make you forget yourself occasionally, so that the beautiful balance of life is not destroyed.
      On experience: The wisdom of those who have lived longer than I, though I never recognize it at the moment, is afterwards nearly always justified.
      On truth: There are very few human beings who receive the truth, complete and staggering, by instant illumination. Most of us acquire it fragment by fragment, on a small scale, by successive developments, cellularly, like a laborious mosaic.
      [on the film, "The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser"] The story of Kaspar is more fascinating than the story of Jesus Christ.
      Life is a process of becoming, a combination of states we have to go through. Where people fail is that they wish to elect a state and remain in it. This is a kind of death.
      Each friend represents a world in us, a world possibly not born until they arrive, and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born.
      When others asked the truth of me, I was convinced it was not the truth they wanted, but an illusion they could bear to live with.
