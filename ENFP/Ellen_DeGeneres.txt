 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Emmy-winning talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres was born in Metairie, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans. Her father, insurance salesman Elliot De Generes and her mother, a real-estate agent, were divorced when she was 16 years old. Her mother remarried, and her new husband, salesman Roy Gruessendorf, moved the family (which included Ellen's brother) to Atlanta, Texas.After graduating from Atlanta High School in 1976, Ellen attended the University of New Orleans as a communication major, but she dropped out after one semester. She held a wide variety of jobs until she turned to stand-up comedy, making her bones at small clubs and coffeehouses before working her way up to emcee Clyde's Comedy Club by 1981. Her comedy was described as a distaff version of Bob Newhart. Beginning in the early 1980s, she toured nationally and was named the funniest person in America after winning a competition sponsored by the cable network Showtime. This led to better gigs, including her first appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962) in 1986.Though DeGeneres's early forays into series television were not successful (she appeared as a supporting player in two short-lived TV situation comedies in the period 1989-92, Open House (1989) and Laurie Hill (1992)), she scored a hit headlining her own 1994 sitcom on ABC "These Friends of Mine" (later renamed Ellen (1994) after its first season). She made TV history in April 1997 when her character, and DeGeneres herself personally, revealed that she was a lesbian. However, the show was canceled the following season due to declining ratings, after which DeGeneres returned to the stand-up circuit. In 2001, DeGeneres launched a new series, The Ellen Show (2001), on CBS, but it suffered from poor ratings and was canceled.Redemption as a television artiste came in 2003, when DeGeneres's daytime talk show, Ellen: The Ellen DeGeneres Show (2003) proved to be both a critical hit and a commercial success. Along with good ratings, the show has won unprecedented kudos from the industry, winning 15 Emmy Awards in its first three seasons on the air and becoming the first talk show in TV history to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show in its first three seasons.DeGeneres has also made a name for herself as a host of awards shows. She hosted the Grammy Awards in 1996 and 1997, as well as the Primetime Emmy Awards in 2001 and 2005. In February 2007, she had the ultimate TV awards show gig, hosting the Oscars.

      "The '60s were when hallucinogenic drugs were really, really big. And, I don't think it's a coincidence that we had the type of shows we had then like The Flying Nun (1967).
      I ask people why they have deer heads on their walls. They always say because it's such a beautiful animal. There you go. I think my mother is attractive, but I have photographs of her.
      My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was sixty. She's ninety-seven now, and we don't know where the hell she is.
      You say you're sick and tired of hearing about me? I've got news for you: I'M sick and tired of hearing about me.
      On hosting the Emmys after the 9/11 tragedy (November 4, 2001): "We're told to go on living our lives as usual, because to do otherwise is to let the terrorists win, and really, what would upset the Taliban more than a gay woman wearing a suit in front of a room full of Jews?"
      "I just like observing people-it's something I've done ever since I was a kid, and I got really good at it. That's a big part of why I became a comedian. My audience is filled with every kind of person you can imagine, and I love that." (Redbook, January 2006)
      "I'd like to be more patient! I just want everything now. I've tried to meditate, but it's really hard for me to stay still. I'd like to try to force myself to do it, because everybody says how wonderful meditation is for you, but I can't shut my mind up. So patience and learning is the key." (Redbook, January 2006)
      "I look at anything in nature and how things work-the stars, the pyramids-and I can't imagine that there's not some kind of design to it all. There's got to be something big that we don't understand. I do believe in Jesus. I believe in being good to one another. Life is about spending our time here contributing and not taking away. That's my faith." (Redbook, January 2006)
      Really, he called me that? Ellen Degenerate? I've been getting that since the fourth grade. I guess I'm happy I could give him work. [When told in an interview that, after she revealed her homosexuality, Jerry Falwell called her 'Ellen Degenerate'].
      There's two things I've always wanted to do in my life. One is to host the Oscars. The second is to get a call from Laura Ziskin. You can imagine that day's diary entry. - After receiving a call from Ziskin, producer of the 2007 Oscars, requesting that Ellen host.
      Every morning, I would come down to the kitchen and I would see myself making coffee and I would think 'oh, she's pretty'. (on what life would be like with an identical twin)
      On why she, a non-singing entertainer, would be a successful American Idol: The Search for a Superstar (2002) judge replacement: I know I'm going to be a great judge - because I've spent my whole life being judged.
      Find out who you are and be that person. That's what your soul was put on this Earth to be. Find that truth, live that truth and everything else will come.
      Never follow anyone else's path, unless you're in the woods and you're lost and you see a path; then, by all means, you should follow that path.
      I'm glad I'm funny. I'm glad I make people happy, because that's very important. But I'm most proud to be known as a kind person...Because kindness spreads, and the world is a little nicer out there.
      We can sit and worry about what's going to happen to us two weeks from now. I'd rather focus on the amazing things happening right in front of us. Animals help us do that.

You're not just in big cities; you're in small towns, mini malls, strip malls...lots of places where, literally, the soup of the day got top billing. There would be a chalkboard on the sidewalk and it would say: SOUP OF THE DAY: BROCCOLI. AND ELLEN DEGENERES."1986Heeeeeere's Johnny!DeGeneres becomes the first female comedian Johnny Carson invites for a chat on the couch on The Tonight Show.

Ellen Lee DeGeneres (/dɨˈdʒɛnərəs/; born January 26, 1958) is an American comedienne, television host, actress, writer, and television producer.[1] She was the star in the popular sitcom Ellen from 1994 to 1998, and has her syndicated talk show The Ellen DeGeneres Show since 2003.
Her stand up career started in the early 1980s, culminating in a 1986 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, who likened her to Bob Newhart, and invited her for an onscreen chat after her set. She was the first comedienne invited by Johnny Carson to join him, a national, and the most influential endorsement available at the time for comics. As a film actress, she starred in Mr. Wrong (1996), appeared in EDtv (1999), and The Love Letter (1999), and provided the voice of Dory in the Disney-Pixar animated film Finding Nemo (2003), for which she was awarded the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress, the only time a voice performance has won a Saturn Award. In 2010 she was a judge on American Idol for its ninth season.
She starred in two television sitcoms, Ellen from 1994 to 1998, and The Ellen Show from 2001 to 2002. During the fourth season of Ellen in 1997, she came out publicly as lesbian in an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Shortly afterwards, her character, Ellen Morgan, also came out to a therapist played by Winfrey, and the series went on to explore various LGBT issues including the coming-out process. In 2008, she married her long-term girlfriend Portia de Rossi.
DeGeneres has hosted the Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, and the Primetime Emmys. She has authored three books, and started her own record company, Eleveneleven. She has won 13 Emmys, 14 People's Choice Awards, and numerous other awards for her work and charitable efforts.
DeGeneres was born and raised in Metairie, Louisiana, the daughter of Elizabeth Jane "Betty" Pfeffer, a speech therapist, and Elliott Everett DeGeneres, an insurance agent.[2][3] She has one brother, Vance, a musician and producer. She is of French, English, German, and Irish descent. She was raised as a Christian Scientist until age 13. In 1973, her parents filed for separation and were divorced the following year. Shortly after, Ellen's mother married Roy Gruessendorf, a salesman. Betty Jane and Ellen moved with Gruessendorf from the New Orleans area to Atlanta, Texas. Vance stayed with his father. On a February 2011 episode of her show, she told her studio audience of a letter from the New England Historic Genealogical Society confirming she is 15th cousin to Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge via their shared common ancestor Thomas Fairfax.[4][5]
DeGeneres graduated from Atlanta High School in May 1976, after completing her first years of high school at Grace King High School in Metairie, Louisiana. She moved back to New Orleans to attend the University of New Orleans, where she majored in communication studies. After one semester, she left school to do clerical work in a law firm with a cousin, Laura Gillen. She also held a job selling clothes at the chain store the Merry-Go-Round at the Lakeside Shopping Center.[citation needed] Her early jobs included working at J. C. Penney,[6] being a waitress at TGI Friday's and another restaurant, a house painter, a hostess, and a bartender. She relates much of her childhood and career experiences in her comedic work.
DeGeneres started performing stand-up comedy at small clubs and coffee houses. By 1981 she was the emcee at Clyde's Comedy Club in New Orleans. DeGeneres cites Woody Allen and Steve Martin as her main influences at this time.[7] In the early 1980s she began to tour nationally; and, she was named Showtime's Funniest Person in America in 1982.[8] In 1986, she appeared for the first time on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, who likened her to Bob Newhart.[7] When Carson invited her for an onscreen chat after her performance, she became the first comedienne to have been offered that opportunity.[8]
Ellen's television and film work in the late 1980s and early 1990s included roles on television in Open House and in the film Coneheads. In 1992, producers Neal Marlens and Carol Black cast DeGeneres in their sitcom Laurie Hill, in the role of Nurse Nancy MacIntyre. The series was canceled after only four episodes, but Marlens and Black were so impressed with DeGeneres' performance that they soon cast her in their next ABC pilot, These Friends of Mine, which they co-created with David S. Rosenthal.
DeGeneres starred in a series of films for a show named Ellen's Energy Adventure, which is part of the Universe of Energy attraction and pavilion at Walt Disney World's Epcot. The film also featured Bill Nye, Alex Trebek, Michael Richards, and Jamie Lee Curtis. The show revolved around DeGeneres's falling asleep and finding herself in an energy-themed version of Jeopardy!, playing against an old rival, portrayed by Curtis, and Albert Einstein. The next film had DeGeneres hosting an educational look at energy, co-hosted with Nye. The ride first opened on September 15, 1996, as Ellen's Energy Crisis, but was quickly renamed to the more positive-sounding Ellen's Energy Adventure.
DeGeneres's first regular TV role was in a short-lived Fox sitcom called Open House. She played the role of Margo Van Meter, an office worker at the Juan Verde Real Estate company. The show co-starred Alison LaPlaca and Mary Page Keller.
DeGeneres's comedy material became the basis of the successful 1994–1998 sitcom Ellen, named These Friends of Mine during its first season. The ABC show was popular in its first few seasons due in part to DeGeneres's style of observational humor; it was often referred to as a "female Seinfeld."[9]
Ellen reached its height of popularity in February 1997, when DeGeneres made her homosexuality public on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Subsequently her character on the sitcom came out of the closet in April to her therapist, played by Oprah Winfrey, revealing that she's gay.[10] The coming-out episode, titled "The Puppy Episode", was one of the highest-rated episodes of the show. The series returned for a fifth season, but experienced falling ratings due to ABC's cutting back on promoting the show. It was believed that The Walt Disney Company, ABC's parent owner, had become uncomfortable with the subject matter depicted on the show now that DeGeneres' character was openly gay. In May 1998, Ellen was canceled. DeGeneres returned to the stand-up comedy circuit, and later re-established herself as a successful talk show host.
DeGeneres launched a daytime television talk show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show in September 2003. Amid a crop of several celebrity-hosted talk shows surfacing at the beginning of that season, such as those of Sharon Osbourne and Rita Rudner, her show has consistently risen in the Nielsen ratings and received widespread critical praise. It was nominated for 11 Daytime Emmy Awards in its first season, winning four, including Best Talk Show. The show has won 25 Emmy Awards in its first three seasons on the air. DeGeneres is known for her dancing and singing with the audience at the beginning of the show and during commercial breaks. She often gives away free prizes and trips to be in her show's studio audience with the help of her sponsors.
DeGeneres celebrated her thirty-year class reunion by flying her graduating class to California to be guests on her show in February 2006. She presented Atlanta High School with a surprise gift of a new electronic LED marquee sign. In May 2006, DeGeneres made a surprise appearance at the Tulane University commencement in New Orleans. Following George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton to the podium, she came out in a bathrobe and furry slippers. "They told me everyone would be wearing robes," she said. Ellen then went on to make another commencement speech at Tulane in 2009.[11]
The show broadcast for a week from Universal Studios Orlando in March 2007. Skits included DeGeneres going on the Hulk Roller Coaster Ride and the Jaws Boat Ride. In May 2007, DeGeneres was placed on bed rest due to a torn ligament in her back. She continued hosting her show from a hospital bed, tended to by a nurse, explaining "the show must go on, as they say." Guests sat in hospital beds as well. On May 1, 2009, DeGeneres celebrated her 1000th episode, featuring celebrity guests such as Oprah Winfrey, Justin Timberlake, and Paris Hilton, among others.[citation needed]
On September 9, 2009, it was confirmed that DeGeneres would replace Paula Abdul as a judge of the ninth season of American Idol. Her role started after the contestant auditions, at the beginning of "Hollywood Week".[12][13] It is reported that DeGeneres also signed a contract to be a judge on the show for at least five seasons.[14] She made her American Idol debut on February 9, 2010. However, on July 29, 2010, DeGeneres and Fox executives announced that the comedian would be leaving American Idol after one season. In a statement, DeGeneres said that the series "didn't feel like the right fit for me".[15]
DeGeneres received wide exposure on November 4, 2001, when she hosted the televised broadcast of the Emmy Awards. Presented after two cancellations due to network concerns that a lavish ceremony following the September 11 attacks would appear insensitive, the show required a more somber tone that would also allow viewers to temporarily forget the tragedy. DeGeneres received several standing ovations for her performance that evening, which included the line: "What would bug the Taliban more than seeing a gay woman in a suit surrounded by Jews?"
In August 2005, DeGeneres hosted the 2005 Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony held on September 18, 2005. This was three weeks after Hurricane Katrina, making it the second time she hosted the Emmys following a national tragedy. She also hosted the Grammy Awards in 1996 and in 1997.
On September 7, 2006, DeGeneres was selected to host the 79th Academy Awards ceremony, which took place on February 25, 2007.[16] This makes her the first openly gay or lesbian person to have hosted the event. During the Awards show, DeGeneres said, "What a wonderful night, such diversity in the room, in a year when there's been so many negative things said about people's race, religion, and sexual orientation. And I want to put this out there: If there weren't blacks, Jews and gays, there would be no Oscars, or anyone named Oscar, when you think about that."[17] Reviews of her hosting gig were positive, with one saying, "DeGeneres rocked, as she never forgot that she wasn't just there to entertain the Oscar nominees but also to tickle the audience at home."[18] Regis Philbin said in an interview that "the only complaint was there's not enough Ellen."
On August 2, 2013, it was announced that Ellen will host the Academy Awards on March 2, 2014 for the second time.[20]
A selfie orchestrated by 86th Academy Awards host Ellen DeGeneres during the March 2, 2014 broadcast is the most retweeted image ever.[21][22] DeGeneres said she wanted to homage Meryl Streep's record 17 Oscar nominations by setting a new record with her, and invited other Oscar celebrities to join them. The resulting photo of twelve celebrities broke the previous retweet record within forty minutes, and was retweeted over 1.8 million times in the first hour.[23][24][25] By the end of the ceremony it had been retweeted over 2 million times, less than 24 hours later, it had been retweeted over 2.8 million times.[22][23] As of 9 March 2014[update], it has been retweeted over 3.3 million times.[22] The group selfie effort was parodied by Lego, and Matt Groening with The Simpsons.[26][27] It beat the previous record, 778,801, which was held by Barack Obama, following his victory in the 2012 presidential election.[25][28][29]
DeGeneres lent her voice to the role of Dory, a fish with short-term memory loss, in the 2003 animated Disney/Pixar film Finding Nemo. The film's director, Andrew Stanton, claimed that he chose Ellen because she "changed the subject five times before one sentence had finished" on her show.[30] For her performance as Dory, DeGeneres won the Saturn Award from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films for "Best Supporting Actress"; "Favorite Voice from an Animated Movie" from the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards; and the Annie Award from the International Animated Film Association for "Outstanding Voice Acting". She was also nominated for a Chicago Film Critics Association Award in the "Best Supporting Actress" category. She also provided the voice of the dog in the prologue of the Eddie Murphy feature film Dr. Dolittle. Her win of the Saturn Award marked the first and only time the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films has given the acting award for a voice performance.
In November 2004, DeGeneres appeared, dancing, in an ad campaign for American Express. Her most recent American Express commercial, a two-minute black-and-white spot in which she works with animals, debuted in November 2006 and was created by Ogilvy & Mather. In 2007, the commercial won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Commercial.
DeGeneres began working with Cover Girl Cosmetics in September 2008, for which she has been criticized, as her animal-friendly values clash with Procter and Gamble's (the maker of Cover Girl Cosmetics) animal testing.[31] Her face became the focus of Cover Girl advertisements starting in January 2009. The beauty campaign was DeGeneres's first.[32]
On December 3, 2011, DeGeneres headlined the third annual "Change Begins Within" gala for the David Lynch Foundation held at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.[33][34]
In spring 2012, DeGeneres became the spokesperson for J. C. Penney in a tour and advertising campaign.[6]
On May 26, 2010, Ellen announced on her show that she was starting her own record label entitled "eleveneleven". Ellen explained her choice of name, claiming that she often sees the number 11:11 when looking at her clocks, that she found Greyson on the 11th, and that the singer's soccer jersey has the number 11.[35] She mentioned that she had been looking for videos of performances on YouTube to start her label. The first act she signed to the label is Greyson Chance.[36]
She is a fan of the National Football League, and has shown particular support for the New Orleans Saints and the Green Bay Packers.[38] In 2011, she attended a Saints practice dressed as Packers Hall of Famer Don Hutson.[39]
In 1997, DeGeneres came out as lesbian. The bold disclosure of her sexual orientation sparked clamorous interest by American tabloids.[40] The contentiousness of the media coverage stunted DeGeneres' professional career and left her "mired in depression".[40] That same year, she started a romantic relationship with actress Anne Heche that lasted until August 2000.[41] In her book Love, Ellen, DeGeneres's mother, Betty DeGeneres describes being initially shocked when her daughter came out, but has become one of her strongest supporters; she is also an active member of Parents & Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) and spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign's Coming Out Project.
From 2001 to 2004, DeGeneres maintained a close affair with actress/director/photographer Alexandra Hedison.[42] The couple appeared on the cover of The Advocate after their separation had already been announced to the media.[43]
Since 2004, DeGeneres has had a relationship with Portia de Rossi. After the overturn of the same-sex marriage ban in California, DeGeneres announced on a May 2008 show that she and de Rossi were engaged,[44][45] and gave de Rossi a three-carat pink diamond ring.[46] They were married on August 16, 2008, at their home, with nineteen guests including their mothers.[46] The passage of Proposition 8 cast doubt on the legal status of their marriage, but a subsequent California Supreme Court judgment validated it because it occurred before November 4, 2008.[47][48] DeGeneres and de Rossi live in Beverly Hills, with three dogs and four cats.[49] On August 6, 2010, de Rossi filed a petition to legally change her name to Portia Lee James DeGeneres[50] The petition was granted on September 23, 2010.[51]
DeGeneres is a vegan who calls herself a "big animal lover".[52][53] De Rossi is a vegan as well.[53] Ellen co-ordinates a vegan outreach website titled 'Going Vegan with Ellen'.[54] She intended to open a vegan tapas bar, Bokado, in Los Angeles, but plans fell through.[55]
The site for The Ellen DeGeneres Show contains a section called "Going Vegan With Ellen," in which she promotes "Meatless Mondays" and features vegan recipes.[56] She has several times invited Humane Society of the United States CEO Wayne Pacelle to speak on her show about the organization's efforts in animal protection legislation. In 2009, PETA named her their "Woman of the Year."[57] In April 2013, she donated $25,000 to stop Ag-Gag anti-whistleblower legislation in Tennessee, which would prohibit undercover investigators from recording footage of animal abuse on farms.[58]

In November 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton named her a Special envoy for Global AIDS Awareness.[60] On December 3, 2011, DeGeneres opened the show at the David Lynch Foundation's 3rd annual "Change Begins Within" gala at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to raise funds to bring Transcendental Meditation to at-risk populations suffering from epidemic levels of chronic stress and stress-related disorders. She says: "TM is the only time I have that stillness… it gives me this peaceful feeling, and I love it so much. I can’t say enough good things about it. All the benefits that you can achieve from sitting still and going within—it really is a beautiful experience. David Lynch is such a wonderful man to start this foundation to help people."[61][62]

Comedian Ellen Degeneres hosts her variety show, Ellen's Even Bigger Really Big Show, on the first day of the 2008 Comedy Festival.
Born:January 26, 1958Ellen DeGeneres Overview:Comedian, talk show host, actress, author and former American Idol Judge Ellen DeGeneres can never be accused of wearing too few hats. Though she rose to prominence as a stand-up comic in the 1980s -- where her neurotic, fast-talking onstage persona was reminiscent of Jerry Seinfeld or Woody Allen -- it's her many other careers that DeGeneres may be best known for. After coming out as a lesbian in 1997, DeGeneres also became one of the most successful openly gay comedians in America.Quick Ellen DeGeneres Facts:Ellen DeGeneres was born in Metairie, Louisiana.
She began performing stand-up in 1981 and was named Showtime's "Funniest Person in America" just one year later.
In 2009, DeGeneres was named as the replacement for Paula Abdul as a judge on American Idol. She left the show after one season.
Ellen DeGeneres' Early Life:Ellen DeGeneres was born and raised in Metairie, Louisiana. After her parents divorced during her teenage years, DeGeneres moved with her mother to Atlanta, Texas. After high school, she moved to New Orleans to attend one year of college. It was here that her career as a stand-up began.
In 1981, DeGeneres began acting as emcee at Clyde's Comedy Club in New Orleans. Shortly thereafter, she began touring the country and by 1982 was named Showtime's "Funniest Person in America." She continued to perform stand-up throughout the 1980s, gradually becoming more and more successful and recognizable in the comedy scene.Ellen DeGeneres Moves to Television:In 1991, DeGeneres won the American Comedy Award for Funniest Female Stand-up Comic. In 1994, she was given her own ABC sitcom not unlike the immensely popular Seinfeld. The show, originally called These Friends of Mine but changed to just Ellen by its second season, was a hit for the network and made the comedian into a full-fledged star.
In 1996, DeGeneres released her first (and only) comedy album, Taste This.Ellen Comes Out:DeGeneres became a national news story when during a 1997 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show she came out as a lesbian. TIME magazine did a cover story on the comic (with the headline "Yep, I'm Gay"), and DeGeneres' sexuality was even worked into the plot of her ABC sitcom. The episode, called "The Puppy Episode," was one of Ellen's highest-rated. The show received an Emmy for Comedy Writing for its 1997 season.
Shortly after the coming-out episode, however, ratings began to decline on Ellen and the series was eventually canceled in 1998. Ellen returned to the stand-up scene.In 2000, Ellen taped Ellen DeGeneres: The Beginning, her first hour-long HBO stand-up comedy special. The following year, she once again entered the sitcom race with The Ellen Show on CBS.

The entire show is available on DVD.Ellen Moves to Talk Shows:In 2003, DeGeneres launched her own daytime talk show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show. The show quickly became a massive hit, gaining recognition for DeGeneres' loose improvisational style, absurd games and especially the comedian's dancing in each show. The talk show became one of the highest-rated daytime talk shows and has so far racked up over 25 Emmy Awards since debuting in 2003.
In 2003, DeGeneres also taped her second HBO comedy special, Here and Now.Ellen's Personal Life and American Idol:After a highly-publicized relationship with actress Anne Heche during the late '90s, Ellen began dating L Word actress Alexandra Hedison in the early 2000s. In 2004, she began seeing actress Portia de Rossi and eventually married her in 2008. Both are now advocates for same-sex marriage.
In 2009, it was announced that DeGeneres would be joining the megahit American Idol in the judges' chair left vacant by former judge Paula Abdul. She announced one year later that she was leaving the show after just one season in the judge's chair.Additional Ellen DeGeneres Facts:After a 1986 appearance on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, Carson invited Ellen over to the couch for an interview. It was a first for any female comedian.

Ellen was Born ...: ... on January 26, 1958, in Jefferson, Louisana. She's the younger of two siblings born to Elliot and Betty DeGeneres. Her brother, Vance, is a comedy writer and was a correspondent on The Daily Show from 1999 to 2001.Growing up with Ellen:Ellen had a fairly typical childhood, raised in New Orleans and Atlanta, Texas.  Her parents divorced while she was in her teens.  She graduated from Atlanta High School and moved back to Louisiana, where she attended the University of New Orleans.  Ellen majored in communications, but left after one semester.Ellen's First Job:Ellen did clerical work for a law firm, which was a followed by a string of jobs: working retail, waiting tables, house painting, bartending and shucking oysters. She even sold vacuum cleaners door-to-door, a job she joked about with Willie Nelson, also a former door-to-door vacuum salesman, on her show. Ellen sold Hoovers.
She got her start in comedy at Clyde's Comedy Club, then the only comedy club in New Orleans, and graduated from comic to emcee.  This led to more shows throughout the South and soon the country.
The Early Years:Ellen toured the states, honing her comedic timing and craft.  In 1982, she was selected by pay-cable station Showtime as "America's Funniest Person."  This led to a series of cable and late-night television appearances, including a shot on The Tonight Show in 1986.
She transitioned from comedian to sit-com star with the success of Ellen.  The quirky show, based on her stand-up comedy, was likened to Seinfeld in its first few seasons.  Becoming a Talk Show Host:In 2003, Ellen launched her daytime talk show The Ellen DeGeneres Show.  The new talk show crop was thick that year, but Ellen rose to the top and has been a show-stopper every since.
Ellen has given the daytime show her signature touch – a lighthearted, carry free romp that begs its audience to forget their troubles and enjoy the conversation.  She marks each show with a dance up front and many thanks at the end, often getting her audience involved in the action.
Key Moment in Her Career:There are arguably two key moments in career (not counting her successful transitions from stand-up comedian to television actress to talk show host).
The first was her appearance on The Tonight Show in 1986. After her set, Johnny Carson invited her to sit next to him, a traditional signal to both comedians and the entertainment industry that Johnny thought this person was something special. Ellen was the first female comedian to be invited over.
The second was when she publicly announced her homosexuality – and did so on her sit-com, Ellen, with a now groundbreaking kiss between her character, Ellen, and a character played by Laura Dern.What Does the Future Hold?:It's fairly wide-open for Ellen, though she seems content with her present gig.  She's shied of stand-up for the foreseeable future.  She's a regular - and quite admired - host of the Emmy Awards and now occassional  blog contributor to The Huffington Post.And Just for Fun:Ellen played the voice of Dory in Disney's Finding Nemo, a role which rejuvenated her career.
She's currently dating Portia de Rossi, of now canceled Arrested Development and helped spotlight the critically acclaimed sit-com.
Her mother, Betty, is her strongest supporter and an active member of PFLAG (Parents, Friends and Family of Lesbians and Gays).
Received multiple standing ovations for her charm, tone and uplifting personality when she hosted the Emmy Awards following the September 11 attacks in 2001.
Tarnished her reputation some with back-to-back super-mini-scandals: 1) Iggygate, in which she cried on air for the return of an adopted - and repossessed - dog to her hairdresser - and then letting the story carry on for weeks, and 2) returning to work within a week once motion picture and television writers went on strike. 
In early 2008, was named "Most Favorite Daytime Talk Show Host," over Oprah Winfrey, in three different polls: AOL poll, The Harris Group poll, and About Talk Shows poll.

Birth Name: Ellen Lee DeGeneresBirth Place: New Orleans, LADate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 01/26/1958, AquariusProfession: Talk-show host; actor; writer; comedian
Championed by late-night TV legend Johnny Carson, DeGeneres initially came to prominence as a stand-up comedian, making numerous appearances on The Tonight Show in the 1980s before landing her own eponymous sitcom in 1994. Although there was a lot of gossip surrounding DeGeneres' sexual orientation, she was silent on the subject until 1997, when she---and her small-screen alter ego---came out, along with her then-lover Anne Heche. The episode sparked controversy and kicked open the closet door for lesbian actresses, though the series was canceled the next season. After a handful of poorly received movies and a short-lived second sitcom (The Ellen Show), DeGeneres found her niche when she began hosting a hugely successful daytime talk show in 2003. Around that time, she also started dating small-screen siren Portia de Rossi, whom she married in 2008 after the overturn of the gay marriage ban in California. DeGeneres' affable nature and widespread appeal have led to several high-profile hosting gigs, including the Emmys, the Grammys and the Academy Awards, as well as a spot on the American Idol judging panel, which she joined in 2010, filling the seat left vacant by Paula Abdul.Ellen DeGeneres Fast Facts:
