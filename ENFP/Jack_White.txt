Jack White (born John Anthony Gillis; July 9, 1975), often credited as Jack White III,[2] is an American musician, singer-songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist, designer, upholsterer, director, writer, and actor. On April 24, 2012, White released his debut solo album, Blunderbuss, which received wide critical acclaim.
He has been ranked No. 17 on Rolling Stone's list of "The 100 Greatest Guitarists".[3] White's popular and critical success with The White Stripes enabled him to collaborate as a solo artist with other renowned musicians, such as Beck, the Rolling Stones, Jeff Beck,[4] Alicia Keys, Bob Dylan, Wanda Jackson, Electric Six, and Loretta Lynn, whose 2004 album Van Lear Rose he produced and performed on. In 2006, White became a founding member of the rock band the Raconteurs. In 2009, he became a founding member and drummer of his third commercially successful group, the Dead Weather.[5] He was awarded the title of "Nashville Music City Ambassador" by the Nashville mayor Karl Dean in 2011.[6] He is a board member of the Library of Congress' National Recording Preservation Foundation, a music historian, collector and philanthropist, as well as an advocate for analog technology and recording techniques.
John Anthony Gillis[7] was born in Detroit, Michigan, the youngest of ten children (six brothers, three sisters) of Teresa (née Bandyk) and Gorman M. Gillis,[8] His mother's family was Polish, while his father had Scottish-Canadian ancestry.[9] He grew up in a Catholic family.[10] His father and mother worked for the Archdiocese of Detroit, as the Building Maintenance Superintendent and secretary in the Cardinal's office, respectively. White eventually became an altar boy, which landed him an uncredited role in the 1987 movie The Rosary Murders, filmed mainly at Holy Redeemer parish in southwest Detroit.[11] As a child, he was a fan of classical music.[12] He was raised in a lower middle-class neighborhood, and attended Cass Technical High School in Detroit.[13]
He began playing the drums at the age of six.[14] As a teenager, White was already listening to the blues and 1960s rock that would influence him in The White Stripes,[11] Son House and Blind Willie McTell being among his favorite blues musicians.[15] He and his childhood friend, Dominic Suchyta (NKA Dominic Davis), would listen to records in White's attic on weekends and began to record cover songs on an old four-track reel to reel tape machine. At the time White was described as "a kid with short hair and braces".[12] He has said in many interviews that Son House's "Grinnin' In Your Face" is his favorite song of all time.[16][17]
In 2005 on 60 Minutes, White told Mike Wallace that his life could have turned out differently. "I'd got accepted to a seminary in Wisconsin, and I was gonna become a priest, but at the last second I thought, 'I'll just go to public school.' I had just gotten a new amplifier in my bedroom, and I didn't think I was allowed to take it with me."[18] At 15, White began a three-year upholstery apprenticeship with a family friend, Brian Muldoon. White credits Muldoon with exposing him to punk music and pushing him to play music with Muldoon as a band: "He played drums, well I guess I'll play guitar then."[19] The two recorded an album, Makers of High Grade Suites, as the Upholsterers. White later started a one-man business of his own, Third Man Upholstery. The slogan of his business was "Your Furniture's Not Dead" and the color scheme was yellow and black—including a yellow van, a yellow-and-black uniform, and a yellow clipboard. Although Third Man Upholstery never lacked business, White claims that it was unprofitable, because of his complacency about money and his business practices that were perceived as unprofessional, including making bills out in crayon and writing poetry inside the furniture.[20] Shortly thereafter, White landed his first professional gig, as the drummer for the Detroit band Goober & the Peas. He also played in other local bands and did solo shows.
White formed The White Stripes in 1997, along with Meg White.[21] The band began its career as part of the Michigan garage rock underground music scene, playing with local bands such as Bantam Rooster, the Dirtbombs, the Paybacks, Rocket 455, and the Henchmen, among others. In 1998, the White Stripes were signed to Italy Records, a small and independent Detroit-based garage punk label, by Dave Buick.[22] The band released its self-titled debut album in 1999, and a year later the album was followed up by the cult classic[23] De Stijl. The album eventually peaked at No. 38 in Billboard's Independent Albums chart when the band had established their popularity. While performing and in music videos, Jack and Meg are very recognisable visually: they dress only in red, white, and black.
In 2001 the band released White Blood Cells. The album's stripped-down garage rock sound drew critical acclaim in the UK and soon afterward in the US, making The White Stripes one of the more acclaimed bands of 2002. The album was followed up in 2003 by the commercially[24][25] and critically successful[26][27] Elephant. Allmusic wrote that the album "sounds even more pissed-off, paranoid and stunning than its predecessor ... darker and more difficult than White Blood Cells. "[28] The album's first single, "Seven Nation Army", was the band's most successful.
The band's fifth album, Get Behind Me Satan, was recorded in White's own home and marked a change in the band's musical direction, with piano-driven melodies and experimentation with marimba and a more rhythm-based guitar playing by White. The band's sixth album Icky Thump, released in 2007, entered the UK Albums Chart at number one[29] and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. The album's sound also included more punk, garage and blues influences than its predecessor. In late 2007, the band announced the cancellation of 18 tour dates due to Meg White's acute anxiety problems.[30]
White had revealed plans to release a seventh, yet-untitled album in the summer of 2009. However, this never materialized.[31][32] The band also made their first live appearance since Meg's anxiety problems in September 2007 on the final episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien on February 20, 2009.[33]
A documentary, The White Stripes: Under Great White Northern Lights, about the band's 2007 tour, in which they played a gig in every Canadian province and territory, appeared in the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival.[34]
In July 2007, The White Stripes made history by playing the shortest concert ever only playing one note, in St John's, Newfoundland. They played a full show later that night at the Mile One Centre in downtown St. John's.[35]
On February 2, 2011, it was reported on the main page of whitestripes.com that the duo had decided to part ways. White stated that it was not due to health issues or artistic differences but there were a "myriad of reasons".[36]
White formed The Raconteurs in 2005 along with Brendan Benson, Jack Lawrence and Patrick Keeler. The origin of the band was the song 'Steady, As She Goes' which White wrote along with Benson. This inspired them to create a full band with the addition of Lawrence and Keeler. The band came together in Detroit during 2005 and, for the remainder of the year, recorded when time allowed. The band's debut album Broken Boy Soldiers was recorded at Benson's home in Detroit. The band set out on tour to support the album, including eight dates as the opening act for Bob Dylan. The group's second album, Consolers of the Lonely, and its first single, "Salute Your Solution", were released simultaneously in 2008. The album received a Grammy nomination.
Jack White and Alison Mosshart performing live with the Dead Weather at the Glastonbury Festival, June 26, 2009.
In early 2009, Jack White formed a new group called the Dead Weather with the Kills' frontwoman Alison Mosshart. White takes drum and vocal duties, while the Raconteurs bassist Jack Lawrence and Queens of the Stone Age keyboardist and guitarist Dean Fertita round the four piece out.
The group debuted a handful of new tracks on March 11, 2009 in Nashville from their debut album Horehound, which came out July 13, 2009 in Europe and July 14, 2009 in North America, on White's Third Man Records label.
On October 16, 2009, Mosshart confirmed that the second album was "halfway done". The first single "Die by the Drop" was released on March 30, 2010. The new album, Sea of Cowards was released on May 7 in Ireland, then on May 11, 2010, in the U.S. and May 10 in the United Kingdom, and again, on White's Third Man Records.
It was rumored that in 2003 White had collaborated with Electric Six for their song "Danger! High Voltage."[37] Both he and the Electric Six denied this, and the vocal work was credited officially to John S O'Leary.[38] However, in a recent radio interview with Tim Shaw on Kerrang! 105.2 in the UK, Electric Six lead singer Dick Valentine talking openly about White singing on this song as well as speculating on the amount of money he was paid ($60,000).[citation needed] Also, a Q magazine article stated that Jack White did in fact work with Electric Six on the song "Gay Bar".[citation needed]
In 2008, White collaborated with Alicia Keys on the song "Another Way to Die", the theme song for the James Bond film Quantum of Solace.
He appeared in the movie Cold Mountain as a character named Georgia and performed five songs for the Cold Mountain soundtrack: "Sittin' on Top of the World", "Wayfaring Stranger", "Never Far Away", "Christmas Time Soon Will Be Over" and "Great High Mountain."
In 2009, Jack White was featured in It Might Get Loud, a film in which he, Jimmy Page, and The Edge come together to discuss the electric guitar and each artist's different playing methods. White's first solo single, "Fly Farm Blues," was written and recorded in 10 minutes during the filming of the movie in August. The single went on sale as a 7-inch vinyl record from Third Man Records and as a digital single available through iTunes on August 11.
In November 2010, producer Danger Mouse announced that White had been recruited for his collaboration with Daniele Luppi entitled Rome along with Norah Jones.[39] White provided vocals to three songs on the album: "The Rose with the Broken Neck," "Two Against One" and "The World."[40]
The song "You Know That I Know", finished and performed by White, was featured on The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams, released on October 4, 2011.
On January 30, 2012 White released "Love Interruption" as the first single off his debut, self-produced solo album, Blunderbuss, which was released on April 24, 2012.[41] On March 3, 2012, he appeared on Saturday Night Live as the musical guest, with Lindsay Lohan hosting.
He played selected dates in the summer of 2012, with festivals such as the Firefly Music Festival, Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, Sasquatch! Music Festival, Fuji Rock Festival in Japan, one of the biggest festivals in the world, Rock Werchter in Belgium, and later in the year he headlined Austin City Limits Music Festival. For his solo shows, White tours with two bands. One, The Peacocks, is all-female and consists of Ruby Amanfu, Carla Azar, Lillie Mae Rische, Maggie Bjorklund, Brooke Waggoner, and alternating bassists Bryn Davies and Catherine Popper. The other, The Buzzards, is all-male and consists of Daru Jones, Dominic Davis, Fats Kaplin, Ikey Owens, and Cory Younts.[42]
On April 1, 2014 Jack White announced his second solo album, Lazaretto, will be released June 10, 2014. He simultaneously released the first single off the album, "High Ball Stepper." [43]
In live settings, White plays two 1965 JB Hutto Montgomery Airline guitars (one which he received from a fan),[44] a three pickup Airline Town & Country (used on tour with the Raconteurs and in the "Steady As She Goes" music video), a Harmony Rocket, a 1970s-era Crestwood Astral II, 1950s-era Kay Hollowbody (given to him by his brother in return for a favor), a Gretsch White Penguin (as seen in the music video for Icky Thump), and a custom Gretsch Rancher Falcon acoustic guitar. When playing with the Raconteurs, White usually plays two custom Gretsch-styled copies of the Duo Jet double-cutaway guitar, which were made in collaboration with his Seattle luthier, Randy Parsons. His main guitar is dubbed the Triple Jet, which is made of copper and features a Gretsch logo from 1912. For their first tour, White also played Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with a Bigsby vibrato tailpiece and three Filtertron pickups. He also uses a Gretsch Rancher acoustic guitar and he now uses a custom Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with two cutaways, a built-in retractable microphone, and a theremin next to the Bigsby. White has dubbed this one the "Triple Green Machine". Also, he plays occasionally with his Gretsch Rancher, a Gibson J-160E. Also, he plays a Gretsch Duo Jet in Cadillac Green. Recently, he has featured his latest Gretsch, a custom white Billy Gibbons/Bo Diddley signature Gretsch Jupiter Thunderbird in the music video for "Another Way to Die", this guitar is also used on his concerts with the Dead Weather, but he also uses a black left-handed one since Sea of Cowards came out. He has also been known to play Fender Telecasters, featuring one in the music video for Loretta Lynn's "Portland, Oregon."
White uses numerous effects to create his live sound, most notably a DigiTech Whammy WH-4 to create the rapid modulations in pitch he uses in his solos.[45] In concert with an MXR Micro Amp and custom Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Distortion/Sustainer, White can produce a very distinctive sound. In 2005, for the single "Blue Orchid," White employed a new Electro-Harmonix creation, the Polyphonic Octave Generator (POG). Similar to (but more versatile than) the Whammy IV, the POG lets the user mix in several octave effects into one along with the dry signal. All of the pedals that he uses live have been professionally painted red to match his red/black/white color scheme (with the exception of his Whammy and the other pedals that are already red). He plugs this setup into a 1970s Fender Twin Reverb and two 100-Watt Sears Silvertone 1485 6×10 amplifiers.[46] With the Raconteurs, he has many more unusual pedals. And also, for the Raconteurs' 2008 tour, he had all of his pedals copper plated by Analog Man.
White also produces a "fake" bass tone by playing the Kay Hollowbody and JB Hutto Montgomery Airline guitars through a Whammy IV set to one octave down for a very thick, low, rumbling sound, which he uses most notably on the songs "Seven Nation Army" and "The Hardest Button to Button" during live performances.[45][47]
On occasion, White also plays other instruments, such as a Black Gibson F-4 mandolin ("Little Ghost"), piano (on most tracks from Get Behind Me Satan, and various others), and an electric piano on such tracks as "The Air Near My Fingers" and "I'm Finding it Harder to be a Gentleman". White also plays percussion instruments such as the marimba (as on "The Nurse"), drums and tambourine. For the White Stripes' 2007 tour, he played a custom-finish Hammond A-100 organ with a Leslie 3300 speaker, which was subsequently loaned to Bob Dylan, and currently resides at Third Man Studios.[48] On Broken Boy Soldiers, he is credited as playing the album's synths and organ; however, bandmate Brendan Benson also received credit for these instruments and it is unclear who played on which song.
With the Dead Weather, White plays a custom Ludwig Classic Maple kit in Black Oyster Pearl. The sizes consist of the following: 16×26 kick, 5×16 snare (primary) 12×14 marching snare (secondary), 7×16 rack tom 14×16 floor tom, two 16×16 floor toms, Paiste 2002 24" crash, 24" ride and two 16" crashes as hi-hats. For the 2009 Full Flash Blank tour, White used a drum head with the Three Brides of Dracula on the front, but in 2010, White employed a new drum head, upon the release of Sea of Cowards, which has an image of The Third Man himself: Harry Lime attempting to escape certain capture in the sewers of Vienna. During the American leg of the 2010 tour, White switched his drum head again featuring a picture of himself in the guise he wore on the cover of Sea of Cowards. This drum head is called Sam Kay by some fans, referring to the insert inside of the 12" LP.
In 2010, White added an acoustic guitar to his collection named Veronica Lake. It is a custom white Gretsch Rancher with a gold double pickguard and a picture of Veronica Lake on the back. He is currently playing it with his band The Dead Weather. It is the newest addition to "Jack's Girlfriends" which already include Claudette Colbert that he plays In the Raconteurs, and Rita Hayworth that he plays in the White Stripes.
In his introduction in the documentary film, It Might Get Loud, White showcases his minimalist style and ingenuity by constructing a rudimentary guitar in a pastoral setting. The "guitar" was built out of a plank of wood, two nails, a glass Coke bottle, a guitar string, and a pickup. He ends the demonstration by saying, "Who says you need to buy a guitar?"
An important aspect of the sound of White's recordings comes from the fact that they are recorded on analog equipment. White has long been a proponent of analog equipment and the associated working methods, stating in a 2012 interview, "I love analogue because of what it makes you do. Digital recording gives you all this freedom, all these options to change the sounds that you are putting down, and those are for the most part not good choices to have for an artist," and "Mechanics are always going to provide inherent little flaws and tiny little specks and hisses that will add to the idea of something beautiful, something romantic. Perfection, making things perfectly in time and perfectly free of extraneous noise, is not something to aspire to! Why would anyone to aspire to such a thing?".[49]
White founded his own studio, Third Man, in 2009, and its main pieces of equipment are a Neve desk and two Studer A800 2-inch 8-track tape recorders. His solo album, Blunderbuss, and the material he releases on his Third Man label are recorded at his own studio. He explained, "For the longest time I did not want to have my own studio gear, mostly because with the White Stripes I wanted to have the constriction of going into a studio and having a set time of 10 days or two weeks to finish an album, and using whatever gear they happen to have there. After 10 to 15 years of recording like that I felt that it was finally time for me to have my own place to produce music, and have exactly what I want in there: the exact tape machines, the exact microphones, the exact amplifiers that I like, and so on."[49]
White has been married twice and divorced twice. He has two children. He is protective of his family's privacy and gives few details of his private life. He states that he does not consider it relevant to his art, saying "It's the same thing as asking Michelangelo, 'What kind of shoes do you wear?'...In the end, it doesn't really matter ... the only thing that's going to be left is our records and photos."[50]
A topic of intrigue has been the actual relationship between Jack and Meg White. In early interviews, the pair presented themselves as siblings, two of ten. The Flaming Lips touch on this in their song "Thank You Jack White (for the Fiber-Optic Jesus That You Gave Me)" released on their 2003 EP Fight Test.[51] However, the Detroit Free Press produced copies of both a marriage license and divorce certificate, confirming Jack and Meg's history as a married couple.[52] Neither addresses the truth officially and over time, they have become less verbal about the origins of their relationship. Jack White has said, though, that siblings are "mated for life", thus such relationships distract less from the music.[11] Jack mentions them being brother and sister in the documentary Under Great White Northern Lights. They were married on September 21, 1996,[53] and were divorced on March 24, 2000.[54] He took her last name.[citation needed]
In 2003, White made his acting debut in Mutant Swinger from Mars, and had a brief but highly publicized romantic relationship with actress Renée Zellweger, whom he met during the filming of Cold Mountain. That summer, the couple were in a car accident in which White broke his left index finger and was forced to reschedule much of the summer tour.[55] He posted the footage of his finger surgery on the web for fans.[56] White and Zellweger's breakup became public in December 2004.[57]
White met British model Karen Elson (twin sister of Kate Elson) when she appeared in The White Stripes music video for "Blue Orchid". The video's director, Floria Sigismondi, noted "you sensed an energy between them".[58][59] They married on June 1, 2005, in Manaus, Brazil.[59] The wedding took place in a canoe on the Amazon River and was officiated by a shaman. A Roman Catholic priest later convalidated their marriage.[citation needed] Manager Ian Montone was the best man and Meg White was the maid of honor. Official wedding announcements stated that "it was the first marriage" for both.[60] On May 2, 2006, the couple had a daughter, Scarlett Teresa White.[61] Their second child, Henry Lee White, was born on August 7, 2007.[62] The White family resides in Brentwood, Tennessee, a suburb south of Nashville,[63] where Elson managed a vintage clothing store called Venus & Mars.[64][65][66] The couple announced their divorce in June 2011, throwing a divorce party to celebrate their sixth anniversary and the "making and breaking of the sacred union of marriage," according to the invitation sent to guests.
On December 13, 2003, White was involved in an altercation with Jason Stollsteimer, lead singer of the Von Bondies, at the Magic Stick, a Detroit club. White was charged with misdemeanor aggravated assault. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of assault and battery, and was fined $750 (including court costs), and was sentenced to take anger management classes.[67]
On July 22, 2013, a Nashville judge barred White from having "any contact with Karen Elson whatsoever except as it relates to parenting time with the parties' minor children."[68]
A counter-motion by White's attorney Cathy Speers Johnson was filed on August 2, 2013, stating that "The reason for filing this response is that Mr. White does not want to be portrayed as something he is not, violent toward his wife and children."[69]
White is often referred to as eccentric.[70] For instance, he has an obsession with the number three.[71] On November 7, 2005, it was widely reported that White had changed his name to "Three Quid" (quid is British slang for pound sterling). However, most reports indicated that this would only last until the end of the tour.[72][73][74]
The Detroit Masonic Temple was nearly foreclosed on in 2013 after it was revealed that owners owed $142,000 in back taxes. In June 2013, it was revealed that the entire bill was footed by White. To thank him for the donation, the temple has decided to rename its largest theater the Jack White Theater.[75][76]

Weird and passionate, with burning eyes and an old man's sensibilities, Jack White spent the 2000s going from promising garage-rocker to international rock star. He was one of the most important guitarists of the decade — on the strength of his forcefulness and ingenuity rather than virtuosity — as well as a great conceptualizer and a top-flight songwriter who could draw on a seemingly bottomless bag of riffs and melodies. 
In the late Nineties, John Anthony Gillis was just another upholsterer moonlighting in a bunch of small-time Detroit garage bands. (One of them was, in fact, called the Upholsterers.) He played lead guitar on The Go's first album, and drums in a group called Goober and the Peas, among others. Sometime in 1996, he married bartender Meg White, took her last name, and started playing music with her: Jack singing and playing guitar, Meg on bare-bones drums.
The marriage didn't last, but the band did. The White Stripes quickly developed a visual vocabulary (everything red, white and black), a collective mythology (Meg and Jack claimed they were brother and sister), and a terrific musical aesthetic, reaching back through the punk and garage music that informed their squall and thump to the rawest, loudest roots of the blues tradition. 
The White Stripes (1999) and De Stijl (2000) were recorded on the cheap, stripped-down and as dangerously playful as a baby panther. Jack's ferocious, riffy original songs sat comfortably next to covers of Bob Dylan, Robert Johnson, Son House and Blind Willie McTell. 
White Blood Cells (Number 61, 2001) was their breakthrough album, given a nudge by the 110-second garage-rock jewel "Fell In Love with a Girl" and its Lego-animation video; it eventually went gold. The duo's thrilling simplicity and directness managed to make other bands' bass parts and greater-than-three-minute song lengths sound like decadent frippery. 
The White Stripes were bona fide rock stars by the release of Elephant (Number Six, platinum, 2003); its single, "Seven Nation Army," only made it to Number 76 on the pop chart, but became an enduring modern-rock radio standard and won a Grammy. Later that year, Jack appeared without Meg in the movie Cold Mountain and on its soundtrack, and with actress Renée Zellweger in gossip columns; he also made some headlines for a tussle with another Detroit garage-rock guy, Jason Stollsteimer of the Von Bondies. (He eventually pleaded guilty to assault.) In 2004, he produced country legend Loretta Lynn's Van Lear Rose album.
Get Behind Me Satan (Number Three, gold, 2005) expanded the White Stripes' instrumental palette a bit: Jack moved beyond guitar to piano, and there's even some marimba on the album. It was followed with an EP, Walking With a Ghost, named after its unlikely but fabulous cover of a Tegan and Sara song. In mid-2005, Jack married model Karen Elson; Meg was her maid of honor.
A songwriting jam with singer-guitarist Brendan Benson somehow turned into a full-on band, the Raconteurs, which also included the rhythm section from the Cincinnati garage band the Greenhornes, bassist Jack Lawrence and drummer Patrick Keeler. Broken Boy Soldiers (Number Seven,2006) was still very much Jack's show, and the group's insistence that they were a real band and not a side project—not to mention Jack's relocation to Nashville—called the continued existence of the White Stripes into question. 
Jack and Meg answered that question promptly: the White Stripes' Icky Thump (Number Two, 2007, gold) continued their ambitious drive outwards from the spartan guitar/drums/voice scheme of their early records (although the three-color visual scheme remained in place). They embarked on an extensive tour of Canada, more or less for the sake of variety. That year, Jack also played Elvis Presley in the comedy Walk Hard.
The Raconteurs did indeed turn out to be an ongoing project. Consolers of the Lonely (2008), released with very little fanfare, made it to Number Seven anyway. White's started yet another band for his next project, The Dead Weather, featuring him behind the drum kit, the Kills' Alison Mosshart singing, the Raconteurs' Lawrence playing bass, and Queens of the Stone Age's Dean Fertita (who'd also played with the Raconteurs on tour) on guitar. White wrote or co-wrote a few songs on their debut album Horehound (Number Six, 2009).
A second Dead Weather album is reportedly already in progress, as is a seventh White Stripes album (although their only gig since 2007 has been Conan O'Brien's final "Late Night" show). White's imprint Third Man Records, initially used only for White Stripes records, has now become a full-on label, pressing vinyl records he's produced or played on. And, in late 2009, he appeared in the 2009 rock-guitar documentary, It Might Get Loud, alongside Jimmy Page and The Edge.

          Jack played guitar and sang in the band The White Stripes. They released six albums: their self-titled debut -- "The White Stripes", "De Stijl", "White Blood Cells", "Elephant", "Get Behind Me Satan", and "Icky Thump", before breaking up in 2011.White also sings and plays guitar in the band The Raconteurs (alternatively known as "the Saboteurs" in Australia). They have released two albums, "Broken Boy Soldiers" and newly released "Consolers of the Lonely".White surprised fans by starting a third band, The Dead Weather, while The White Stripes and The Raconteurs were still active. White is primarily a drummer and vocalist for "The Dead Weather", with Dean Fertita acting as guitarist. "The Dead Weather" released their debut album "Horehound" in 2009."The White Stripes" won three VMAs for the video for "Fell In Love With A Girl". They played two dates in Detroit in early August supported by The Strokes, and supported them when "The Strokes" played two dates in New York. He has written songs for the film Cold Mountain (2003).White has appeared in the movies Cold Mountain (2003), Coffee and Cigarettes (2003), The Fearless Freaks (2005) and Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (2007). He was one of the subjects of the documentary It Might Get Loud (2008).White is married to model Karen Elson and the couple has two children, Scarlet Theresa and Henry Lee.In Rolling Stone's 2003 list of The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time, White ranked 17th.
          Jack White was born John Anthony Gillis on 9th July 1975 into a musical, catholic family of 10 children in Detroit. He learned to play the guitar, drums and piano. He played in many bands growing up including The Go, Two Star Tabernacle. At 17 he was offered an apprenticeship at Muldoon Studio-an upholstery shop. During his time at Muldoon Studios, he formed a band with Brian Muldoon, the owner; they produced a 3-track single called The Upholsterers. Jack went on to have his own business, Third Man upholstery at about 21 years of age. Around this time he met Meg White, a bartender, and they married in 1996. On Bastille Day 1997, the story goes that Jack was practicing guitar when he sat Meg behind a drum kit and loved how she played, child-like. They formed the band there and then with Jack playing guitar and singing and Meg on drums, they named themselves The White Stripes, after Meg's favorite sweet-peppermints. With Meg's primitive drumming, their basic sound and their uniform appearance of red and white, they made an image of being innocent and child-like, also saying they were siblings. They were signed to Sympathy for the Record Industry, and in 1999 they produced a self-titled album. By this time they had ceased living together and divorced in the year their second album, De Stijl (2000) was made. The band remained intact and signed to a bigger label, V2 Records. Under this record label they made White Blood Cells and their current album, and most popular was the 2003 Elephant. Jack furthered this fame by appearing in blockbuster civil war movie Cold Mountain (2003). He also faced a few mishaps -- including a car crash in which he broke a finger and had to have screws put into his hand, which canceled many gigs.
      In mid-2003, after filming Cold Mountain (2003), he was involved in a car accident along with passenger and co-star Renée Zellweger. Renee was unhurt, but White wound up with a broken finger which coincidentally postponed his The White Stripes tour.
      Often refers to ex-wife and band mate, Meg White, as his sister. It was revealed this was untrue when their marriage and divorce certificates were posted onto the Internet.
      Produced Loretta Lynn's 2004 album "Van Lear Rose". He also played guitar on the album and duets with Loretta on the track "Portland Oregon."
      His relationship with Renée Zellweger (they met during the filming of Cold Mountain (2003)) ended over the Christmas holidays in 2004.
      He and wife, Karen Elson, a model for Prada and Banana Republic, were married in a canoe in the Amazon River in Brazil.
      Explains that the band is based around the number 3, and even calls himself Three Quid when in the UK.
      Has a side project titled The Raconteurs with friends. The band consist of Jack Lawrence, Brendon Benson, Jack White and Patrick Keeler.
      Daughter, Scarlett Teresa White, born 2 May 2006 in Tennessee. Scarlett has Jack's legal last name, which has been White since his marriage to Meg White.
      Jack and his wife, Karen Elson, became the parents of their second child, a boy named Henry Lee Gillis, on August 7, 2007.
      As one of an ensemble of musicians who paid homage to honoree Paul McCartney on the occasion of his "Gershwin Prize for Popular Song", White performed McCartney's classic ballad "Mother Nature's Son" at the White House (June 2, 2010). The festive ceremonies were presided over by President Barack Obama, no stranger to the music of The Beatles.
      Vinyl is the only thing that's rising because I think it's the only thing that the real music lovers are attaching themselves to-because it's a tangible format that has lasted this long for a reason, because it still sounds the best, it still feels the best. There's an inherent romance to it. When you see the disc moving around, you feel connected, you got up and put the needle down, you feel connected. Just like in a movie theater when they turn the lights down and the movie comes up you feel reverential toward it. When it's digital and you can fast-forward and skip it with a mouse and click it off, you're not reverential toward the music. You're the one is control and you're pushing it around. You can imagine if you're in a movie theater and you could fast forward the movie, it would be a disaster. That's what vinyl is to music.... All the music lovers know it, all the musicians know it, we've all been saying that no one wants it to be invisible and digital. It's great to have a portable song that you can listen to in your car, that's great, but when it comes down to it, we want to be reverential toward the art form, and the music business is in a giant mess right now, because of technology. And that's the only reason. If the technology hadn't changed we wouldn't be in the mess we're in.... If you tell someone about a band, if they can't go on YouTube and listen to the band, they get disinterested and they'll move onto something else. You used to go travel around. I used to go really far, to another record store like 45 minutes away because they had the record that the other store didn't . You'd get up out of your seat and do something for real.That's what this truck is about: it's about people coming here and experiencing something for real. There's a novelty aspect to it, but the best part of it is that people are coming here with their physical bodies and they're talking about music together and what bands they like and what records Third Man is putting out that they've got, and we have Third Man playing onstage. There's nothing going on here in the virtual world, this is all real. That's the thing about coming to a festival, people really want to experience music.
      Younger musicians might look at someone who's quote-unquote "made it," and think well, that's it, they won the lottery now they can do whatever they want, and that means go to the Bahamas and just party all the time. But my opinion has always been if you call yourself an artist, you have a responsibility to that liberty that you've given yourself. You don't have a day job where you work 9 to 5 at a factory because your an artist? Well, okay, well then you better make some art. That doesn't mean you can sit around all day and do nothing. That's the way I treat myself, and those are the artists I respect who do that. And it doesn't have anything to do with being a workaholic or anything like that; it's about creating all the time, because that's what you can't help but do.
      No matter how much I try to write a song about characters and the interactions they're having, no matter what I do, I can never make it not come from my own experiences. As an artist you're a victim of your environment. I'd like to make up a scenario, but my writing ends up having a lot to do with with things I've felt and observed.
      [on growing up in Detroit] I think you learn how to walk down the street in a certain way. I think you just learn to have a way about yourself, a style of walking down the street, that keeps people away from you.
      Playing drums feels like coming home for me. Even during the White Stripes I thought: 'I'll do this for now, but I'm really a drummer.' That's what I'll put on my passport application.
      I consider music to be storytelling, melody and rhythm. A lot of hip-hop has broken music down. There are no instruments and no songwriting. So you're left with just storytelling and rhythm. And the storytelling can be so braggadocious, you're just left with rhythm.
      I think that sometimes love gets in the way of itself - you know, love interrupts itself. We want things so much that we sabotage them.
      Vinyl is the real deal. I've always felt like, until you buy the vinyl record, you don't really own the album. And it's not just me or a little pet thing or some kind of retro romantic thing from the past. It is still alive.
      This generation is so dead. You ask a kid, 'What are you doing this Saturday?' and they'll be playing video games or watching cable, instead of building model cars or airplanes or doing something creative. Kids today never say, 'Man, I'm really into remote-controlled steamboats.'
      I really don't like to take the easy way out, if I can help it, on anything I do, I like to really make it a challenge. I don't know how to create by taking the easy routes. I've tried, you know, I've tried to let myself, but I always struggle to compensate.
      I want to be part of the resurgence of things that are tangible, beautiful and soulful, rather than just give in to the digital age. But when I talk to people about this they just say, 'Yeah, I know what you mean,' and stare at their mobiles.
      A lot of people in the media, and some everyday people, really aren't in search of the truth. They're in search of something worse than that. Money, yeah. I think the media's the kind of a thing where the truth doesn't win, because it's no fun. The truth's no fun.
      I keep guitars that are, you know, the neck's a little bit bent and it's a little bit out of tune. I want to work and battle it and conquer it and make it express whatever attitude I have at that moment. I want it to be a struggle.
      I dabbled in things like Howlin' Wolf, Cream and Led Zeppelin, but when I heard Son House and Robert Johnson, it blew my mind. It was something I'd been missing my whole life. That music made me discard everything else and just get down to the soul and honesty of the blues.
      I know that's blasphemous when you are from Detroit, but I was never a fan of Motown stuff. I don't care for the production much.
      With the White Stripes we were trying to trick people into not realizing we were playing the blues. We did not want to come off like white kids trying to play black music from 100 years ago so a great way to distract them was by dressing in red, white and black.
      We have a secret project at Third Man where we want to have the first vinyl record played in outer space. We want to launch a balloon that carries a vinyl record player.
      I'd make a White Stripes record right now. I'd be in the White Stripes for the rest of my life. That band is the most challenging, important, fulfilling thing ever to happen to me. I wish it was still here. It's something I really, really miss.
      I've always felt it's ridiculous to say, of any of the females in my life: You're my friend, you're my wife, you're my girlfriend, you're my co-worker. This is your box, and you're not allowed to stray outside of it.
      I was in a Montessori school. There was a drum circle with all the kids passing around a little bongo drum. I was the last person in the circle, and when it got to me I played 'Shave and a Haircut, Two Bits' - in front of all the parents. Blew the crowd away at five years old.
      The auctioneer is talking for both people, and that's the big revelation about, 'Oh, that's what they're doing.' They're just doing it very fast, so you could kind of miss on that. He's speaking for you, because people in the crowd don't have a voice, so that's what really makes it compelling.
      Nowadays, everybody assumes, when they wake up in the morning, if they have a question, it will get answered. Because they have the internet. No matter what the question is, someone will answer their question.
      I just think old old movies, they make you concentrate and pay attention so much more. They feel so warm. A lot of modern digital videotape, it's just too bright. Don't know why, it's not warm.
      When you put something out there into the world, there's all these words you don't want to hear, that you hope people don't say. I don't like anything that starts with 're' - like retro, reinvent, recreate - I hate that. It's always like living in the past - copying, emulating.
      I wanted to be able to talk with people who have trade jobs and make records with them. I want to do more records with carpenters, electricians, people who specialize in even more bizarre trades that are off the beaten path.
      If you have twenty guys in the room and you just bring in one girl, you change the entire mood and everyone plays different.
      That's what happens nowadays with people working on computers. They can so easily fix things with their mouse and take out all the, 'Oh, somebody coughed in the background; we need to take that out' - or somebody hit a bad note. Those are all the best moments.
      There's Catholic guilt about things, then there's the guilt of being the youngest of 10, so when nice things happen to you, you're not really allowed to enjoy them.
      I would never purposely sing a song about someone I love, I wouldn't want to embarrass them. But for someone I don't like... I would definitely do that.
      An auctioneer is such a uniquely American thing. I keep thinking in my head, perhaps it's not as American as I think, but it feels so Southern. It feels so American. Like, hundreds of years of American tradition is involved in it.
      There aren't that many things left that haven't already been done, especially with music. I'm interested in ideas that can shake us all up.
      I grew up in the 90s in the time of grunge when if you didn't go on stage in jeans and a T shirt you weren't 'real.' That seemed ridiculous to me.
      It is a myth that art has to be sold. It is not like stocking a grocery store where people fill a pushcart. Art is a product that has no apparent need. The salesperson builds the need in the mind of the buyer.
      I think the sensitivity that you need to create certain things sometimes would spill over into things that shouldn't have bothered me.
      I've always loved the word blunderbuss. I've always thought that it was a beautiful word and that it could mean several different things.
      I didn't really even think of recording under my own name for a long time. I thought, 'I've got the rest of my life to do that.'
      I certainly wouldn't want a song that I'd already written to be used on a commercial. That seems strange.
      I think it takes a lot of trickery to keep up with the media and its perception of you. I don't know if I have it in me most of the time to care. The music is made first, and the interviews or photos to keep it alive come later as a necessary evil, I suppose.
      I think you can't really escape any kind of spiritual education as a child, whether it's New Age or Judaism or Buddhism or whatever it is. You can't escape it, even if you completely disagree with it, you still have it as a foundation that you base things off of.
      The way I like to start a new project is to take a cover song and make a stab at it, ideally one that has nothing to do with the people in the room.
      The fact that we elected Obama was a sign that the black struggle inherent in the blues and so much of the music I have loved can triumph.
      My mother's the youngest of 10 children too, so we have sort of a special bond in that we know what that feels like. It's a strange spot to be in.
      My mother was 45 when she had me, so when I was in high school my parents were the same age as my friends' grandparents.
      People aren't buying records like they used to, so it's nice to try to figure out a way to make them do it. I would enjoy the same thing to own an old movie house, to try to trick people to come in - like having 3-D or Smell-o-Vision or Vibra-Vision or something. Mcguffins to get people interested.
      If you want to put out a million CDs and sell them and get them played on the radio, and even videos, or whatever, if that still exists, that kind of muscle can only come from a label like Columbia.
      I have so much music inside me I'm just trying to stay afloat. I don't tend to write for a particular band - you have to just write the songs and then let God into the room and let the music tell you what to do.
      I came up from growing up with a lot of Catholic guilt, a lot of punk rock, hipster guilt in the later years where I think people have thrown a lot of things on me. Where I always felt like I'm not supposed to tell the horn section what to play or I don't want to come off egotistical.
      For new bands, I think a major label is the safest place to be. Independent labels are the ones getting away with murder. A lot of them are hobbyists who rip-off young bands, taking advantage of people who would never get signed to a major.
      Well, as a songwriter, it's really dangerous to use the word love in a song. It's a word that has been used in songs so many millions of times before, and it's the most popular topic to ever write about.
      We were like a white family from the 1920s or something. My parents had this bizarre, different way of looking at things from the people that surrounded us. I went to an all-Mexican grade school and an all-black high school, and not many people in those places liked the same stuff as me.
      The Guinness book is a very elitist organization. There's nothing scientific about what they do. They just have an office full of people who decide what is a record and what isn't.
      Some people remaster their records six, seven times, remix it three, four times, spend a million hours, then they always go back and hear a demo of it and they'll say, 'Aw that sounds so much better than the final mix.'

The former White Stripes frontman has recalled his challenging upbringing. He came from a large family, being the youngest of ten children, and was raised in a lower middle-class neighbourhood in Detroit, Michigan.
"My mom's Polish and she was born in the Depression. I was raised by people who were senior citizens, along with nine brothers and sisters. So I was really raised like a kid in the '40s from Europe, plucked in the middle of blue-collar America," he told the January edition of Esquire magazine. "We'd go to Catholic school and that was a decaying religion in Detroit at that time because there were no white people left - they'd all moved away - and Detroit was already decaying as well."
Although Jack had a tough childhood, he says his early years had a huge impact on his desire to pursue a career in music.
"But all of that showed me the beauty of music, song-writing structure, family, folk, culture. All those were involved in constructing how I looked at the world," he explained.
The 37-year-old musician struggled to connect to children in his neighbourhood. Jack had very different interests to most of his school mates, and also admits he was heavily influenced by his older siblings.
"I went to an all-Mexican school and graduated to an all-black high school, and I'm coming home and watching The Godfather and listening to Hank Williams and reading about the Second World War, and at school everyone's doing none of that!" Jack laughed. "You don't really know what's cool any more, and I had so many older brothers and sisters and I cared what they thought so much. I was indoctrinated to assume that if I was ever going to attempt anything new in my life, it had to be approved through that committee."

BiographyJack White (born John Anthony Gillis, 9.7.1975)Jack White is an American singer, guitarist and record producer.Jack White: ChildhoodJack White was born into a large family, in which he was the youngest of 10 siblings. His parents, Teresa and Gorman Gillis both worked for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese. His mother was secretary to the Cardinal and his father was a maintenance man. Jack was an altar boy, like all of his brothers before him.Aged five, Jack began to learn the drums. Although many of his classmates were into the hip-hop and electronica of surrounding Detroit neighbourhoods, at school, White was interested in the blues and 1960s rock.At the age of 15, White embarked on an apprenticeship in the art of upholstery. He soon had his own business, named Third Man Upholstery, though business practices such as making out invoices in crayon and writing poetry in the furniture detracted from his potential profitability.Jack White: Musical CareerJack formed The White Stripes with Meg White in 1997. The band released a number of independent singles and albums and Jack was invited to play guitar on The Go's 1999 album Whatcha Doin'. The White Stripes' debut, eponymous album was released in 1999 on the Sympathy for the Record Industry label. The album was produced by the renowned Detroit musician Jim Diamond. The album was followed by a split "7 single with local band The Dirtbombs called 'Hand Springs'.The band's second album was entitled De Stijl and was recorded on an 8-track analogue recorder in Jack's house. In 2000, they released 'Party of Special Things to Do' on the Sub Pop label. The record was an EP of Captain Beefheart songs. In 2001, the band released White Blood Cells, again on Sympathy for the Record Industry. With songs such as 'Fell In Love With A Girl' getting picked up on by the British press, the album was re-released by V2 in Europe.Elephant, the band's 2003 album was recorded at London's Toerag Studios by Liam Watson.

I love the white stripes music,I have become addicted to the music.The only other band that i can say I love all there music is led zepplin.All there music is different and is meaningful,Jack and Meg are fantastic together.They will never be a one hit wondertheres just too much talent in both of them.I seen them in providence ri and I just fell in love with the music even more.all I listen to is the stripes.I work at women and infants hospital in providence r.i.in the lab and theres a stripes following inthe lab.Its unbelievable,we sit and talk and exchange music.We Love you in rhode island.
i love The White Stripes i like them so much that when i had braces i had to have them red and white ive got all their albums and who wouldn't.  I can't believe Billy Childish saying that he has a better moustache come on he looks like Adolf Hitler he needs to get a life just because Jack has one doesn't mean anyone can critisize him.  Im definately going to buy The Raconteurs album on May 16th i love the video to Steady As She Goes its funny with the cows well i went a little off the subject with the whole Raconteurs thing but anyway i love the white stripes they got me into drumming they are my idols.  I seem to be the only one in my school who likes them but im very happy to represent them at school lol
I only found one of their albums 2 years ago when i was looking through the hundreds of cd's we got. I played seven nation army and thought how could I not have known about them lolTHe more I heard the more i liked them and i even use their music to train horses I found out that they came to New Zealand about 3 days   befor i found that cd and I was soooooooooo pissed off  and they havn't come back since :(I went to america last september and we drove to texas  and we pretty much went strait past tennisee but we didn't have time to go to nashville by the looks of things i wont be able to get to see them live:(
I am a 64 yr. old great grandma, but Im a rocker and I know a genius when I hear one. Jack and Meg got my heart and soul. I cant get enough of them.It seems Jack can do anything, rock, coutry, blues. folk, movie soundtracts and its ALL good.Best lyrics ever. Love the fact that Jack and Meg are are so close. Marriage ruins a lot of friendships lol   You can see the total respect they have for each other.I hope they have love and happiness all thier life.I would love to see them live.  I saw Paul Mcrtney twice and the only band that is worth that much a ticket would be White Stripes.  My kids and thier kids love them too.
