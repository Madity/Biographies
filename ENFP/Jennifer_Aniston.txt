      When somebody follows you 20 blocks to the pharmacy, where they watch you buy toilet paper, you know your life has changed.
      [on her marriage to Brad Pitt, after two years] Everybody always asks if we're happy. Give me a break. We're married two years. In Hollywood years, that's forever.
      [on the constant rumors surrounding her split from Brad Pitt] There is always going to be the tough and the nasty. You just tune out to that.
      [on the irony of the title of her movie, The Break-Up (2006)] Well, you know. I figured just seize the moment.
      I've learned that you can get through things that hurt. Nothing will kill you. Nothing. People are unbelievable. we have such resilience.
      [about her divorce from Brad Pitt] A man divorcing would never be accused of choosing career over children. That really pissed me off. I've never in my life said I don't want to have children. I did and I do and I will! The women who inspire me are the ones who have careers and children; why would I want to limit myself? I've always wanted to have children, and I would never give up that experience for a career. I want to have it all.
      [on seeing pictures of Angelina Jolie and her ex-husband Brad Pitt together] I will not let myself down like that -- I also know what feels good and it doesn't feel good to harbor anger and resentment ... We do have tools to work through stuff. Everybody does. (Good Morning America 2005)
      The most unconditional love that you can encounter is with a dog. They're excited the minute you come home, and they show the same amount of excitement everyday. They're loyal and they're always, always faithful.
      I would say I couldn't be in a relationship without equality, generosity, integrity, spirit, kindness and humor. And awesomeness!
      [on turning 45] I guess it is a milestone. I really try not to focus on it too much to be honest. Society focuses on it way more than we need to. I think it's always important to reflect anyway, no matter what age you're approaching or what milestone is on front of you. Reflection should be almost a daily thing if possible. Because I was never a 'where do you see yourself in five years' person, I had no idea. And I didn't have a checklist, which really creates a lot less stress in your life.
      [on the weirdest beauty regimen she'd tried] I didn't go too crazy. You mean, did I ever put leeches on my face? ..The closest I'll go to is a derma-roller. Google it - it's great. It's like a little wheel that has little pins, like acupuncture needles in a way, and you roll it and it stimulates your collagen and allows for your products to seep into your skin.

=======================================================
Once known for having the most requested copycat haircut in history, Jennifer Aniston has accrued A-list status in the past decade as Brad Pitt's ex-wife and of course, the much-loved Rachel in 'Friends'. Always emerging to face the world with a smile on her face, this canny actress's star will be at the forefront of the Hollywood Walk of Fame for many years to come.
Jennifer Joanna Aniston was born on 11 February 1969 in LA. Her Greek-born father, John (real name Yannis Anastassakis), had been brought to the US when he was 10 and was an actor, starring in TV series such as 'Combat!' and 'I Spy', and her mother, Nancy, was also an actress.When John's stint in NBC's longest running soap 'Days of our Lives' ended in 1970, so did his steady income and so, when Aniston was five, he uprooted the family back to his home city, Athens, in order to retrain for a medical profession. The Anistons remained in Greece for a year until a call from his agent saw John returning to New York with the family to take a three-year part in 'Love of Life'.But this re-ignited success coincided with Aniston's parents divorcing in 1978, when she was nine. In a bid to reunite them, she started to play up at school – the famous Rudolf Steiner school known for its strict policies, in a hope that her parents would be forced together when called to the principal's office! Despite lacking in drive when it came to her education, Aniston revelled in her time spent at the drama club and after catching an episode of 'Fame' on TV, she knew where her career destiny lay, going on to enroll at the 'real life' Fame, the New York High School of Performing Arts.Graduating in 1987, Aniston decided against going to college and began working as a waitress in Hollywood while auditioning for roles. Her first television part came in 1990 in the comedy series 'Molloy' and next she took a longer-stint in the widely panned adaptation of the hit film, 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'. Luck wasn't on her side after she won several roles in what transpired to be a succession of cancelled programmes and for a while she considered giving up acting altogether.But fate would save her when she successfully auditioned for a new comedy series called 'Friends Like These'. Originally asked to play the character Monica Geller, she convinced the producers that she'd be better suited instead for the part of Rachel Green. The audition was a success and in 1994 the first episode of the shortened-title, 'Friends' aired. The rest is history as they say and Aniston would play the part of Rachel for the next ten years, propelling her name to A-list stardom and losing a stone and a half in weight in the process.Like her fellow cast members, Aniston wanted to use her free time to progress her film career but initially it seemed she never quite picked the right project to propel her beyond her recognition as Rachel. 'She's The One' (1996) was followed by 'Picture Perfect' (1997) but although they were both entertaining in a 'DVD night-in' kind of way, both came and went without critics even batting an eyelid.But meanwhile her love life looked to be hotting up. After spending two years living with the actor Tate Donovan, they split it 1998 and her agent thought it would be a good move to set her up on a blind date – who transpired to be Brad Pitt. Just two years later, the couple married in a $1 million ceremony in Malibu where Aniston reportedly vowed to make Pitt's favourite banana split and Pitt promised to find a balance on the thermostat.But the end of their marriage would be sealed when Pitt began shooting the film 'Mr and Mrs Smith' in 2005 with renowned bad girl, Angelina Jolie. Despite being papped holidaying in the Caribbean with 'Friends' pal Courtney Cox and her husband David Arquette in January 2005, just a few days later Aniston announced her separation from Pitt.In October, their divorce was finalised and media speculation was rife as to the reason why Hollywood's hottest couple had decided to go their separate ways. Some headlines claimed that Aniston's refusal to have children had created a divide between them but she fiercely denied this. And by 2006, Jolie had come clean that she and Pitt had fallen in love on the set of 'Mr & Mrs Smith' and despite denying pursuing him as he was "married to his best friend", the pair went public on their relationship not long after his divorce and have remained together ever since, their brood extending to six children (three adopted) at last count.Despite being so publicly torn from her relationship, Aniston refused to hide away and wallow in self-pity. Her career had seen a hiatus since her starring turn in 2002's low-budget flick 'The Good Girl', which was a surprise hit - taking $14 million at the box office and showing off her talents as a 'serious' actress. She'd also won her first Emmy (after two previous nominations on the trot) in 2002 for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and earned critical acclaim in 'Bruce Almighty' alongside Jim Carey (2003). Not only that, but after starting out on a healthy $35,000 per episode for the first series of 'Friends', her pay cheque for the final season in 2004 rocketed to a grand $1 million.Pitt may have got the girl, take two, but Aniston has earned even more fans through her steadfast resolve not to play the bitter ex-wife. Her career has gone from strength to strength – a turn in 2006's 'The Break Up' led to huge box office success and even a brief romance with co-star Vince Vaughn, who Aniston described as bringing her "back to life" after her divorce.She followed this up with an equally successful appearance in 'Marley & Me' in 2008, which was a commercial hit, grossing over $242 million from a budget of just $10 million. Furthermore, the movie co-starring Owen Wilson also set the largest Christmas Day box office ever after achieving $14.75 million in ticket sales.Buoyed by the success of the film, Aniston went on to star, alongside an ensemble cast including Ben Affleck, Drew Barrymore and Scarlett Johansson, in 2009 romantic comedy 'He's Just Not That Into You', another commercial hit. The same year also saw her appear in 'Love Happens' with Aaron Eckhart, and 'Management', her first effort as Executive Producer.In 2010, Aniston teamed up with Scottish actor Gerald Butler for 'The Bounty Hunter', which despite receiving overwhelmingly negative reviews, did well at the box office. 'The Switch', which she produced, was her next effort and the movie received mixed reviews from critics. She has been busy in recent times and appeared in 'Just Go with It', 'Wanderlust' and 'Horrible Bosses' in 2011.Since then, she has acted in an episode of 'Burning Love' in 2012. Next year, she will feature in 'We're the Millers' as well as 'Miss You Already'. Aniston is also expected to appear in a as yet unnamed film by Elmore Leonard.In an interview with Justin Theroux, Jennifer's co-star in 'Wanderlust', the actor raved about appearing alongside the 42-year-old.He described the experience of working with the award-winning actress as "amazing" and described her as "fantastic, the classiest lady I know". Theroux went on to explain that Jennifer would make him blueberry smoothies packed with antioxidants when he caught a cold on set, and would give him Chinese herbal medicines if he was "feeling low".After appearing in 'Wanderlust' together Aniston and Theroux started dating. They had been close friends for years but only took their relationship to the next level after this film. They have been virtually inseparable ever since and are now set to tie the knot. It was reported on 13 August 2012 that Theroux proposed to the actress on Friday 10 August while they were out celebrating his birthday.A spokesperson for Theroux told People: "Justin Theroux had an amazing birthday on Friday, receiving an extraordinary gift when his girlfriend, Jennifer Aniston, accepted his proposal of marriage." Hopefully this will put paid to the rumours that the actress has not been able to get over Pitt.
Jennifer is almost as well known for her looks, not to mention that Rachel haircut, as she is for her work as an actress, and a recent interview with her fitness trainer in Glamour magazine revealed some of the star's body secrets.Mandy Ingber, Aniston's trainer, explained that she does "flow yoga" with the actress, which "involves moving frequently and holding various poses". She explained that this is then interspersed with toning exercises, such as leg lifts, squats and lunges.Aniston said of herself that she has been accused of being both too thin and too heavy at various points in her career, so her philosophy is to "stop trying to please everyone".One of the richest women in the entertainment industry, according to Forbes, Aniston has not only won a Golden Globe, but also picked up 22 other gongs and 44 award nominations over the course of her career. Her resilience and determination have proven that she will always remain one step ahead – whatever the world throws at her and she is arguably one of the most respected and highest earning actresses in Hollywood. Add to that her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which she was awarded on 22 February 2012, Aniston is one of the top actresses in the industry.

While it's hard to believe that this beloved actress made her film debut in the low-grade 1993 horror flick Leprechaun, even megastars have to start somewhere. The attractive, quirky daughter of soap-opera star John Aniston studied acting at New York's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of the Performing Arts (aka the Fame school) and appeared in a handful of stage productions before moving to Los Angeles. Although she had no problem landing small-screen roles, they were all on short-lived series, until she signed on to Friends in 1994. Aniston instantly charmed audiences with her perfect looks and endearingly flawed persona, and during the sitcom's 10-year run she won an Emmy and a Golden Globe, became a hairstyle icon and married Brad Pitt. In the mid-1990s, Aniston began to appear in films while on hiatus from the small screen. Though she proved her dramatic chops as a frustrated wife who has an affair with a teen in the indie The Good Girl, she was usually called upon to play a variation of her neurotic and adorable Friends' character (Picture Perfect, The Object of My Affection, Rumor Has It... ). Meanwhile, her love life constantly kept her in the spotlight. After reigning as Hollywood's It Couple for eight years, Aniston and Pitt split in 2005 when rumors circulated that he had taken up with his Mr. & Mrs. Smith costar Angelina Jolie. (Of course, those rumors were proved true.) After her 2005 divorce, speculation about her romantic life made her a popular tabloid cover girl, and high-profile relationships with Vince Vaughn (her costar in The Break-Up) and singer John Mayer helped fan the flames. A pleasant by-product of her popularity is the attention it brings to some of her favorite charities, including St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, for which she appeared in a widely seen 2009 PSA.  Jennifer Aniston Fast Facts:

=======================================================
Though she would spend most of her youth in New York, Jennifer Aniston was born Jennifer Joanna Aniston in Sherman Oaks, California, on February 11, 1969. She spent one year of her childhood at the age of 5 in Greece, the country where her father is from. Well connected to the business from the beginning – her father is veteran Days of Our Lives star John Aniston; her godfather is none other than Telly Savalas – Jennifer did not discover her own penchant for acting until attending the Rudolf Steiner School drama club at 11.
Aniston proved to be a talented painter during her stay at the Rudolf Steiner School (one of her pieces was displayed at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art), but acting became her primary focus after graduating from New York’s prestigious High School for the Performing Arts in 1987, and she held roles in off-Broadway productions such as For Dear Life and Dancing on Checker’s Grave.
Though Friends launched Aniston’s career as a sitcom actress, her television debut was in 1989, when she starred in 1990′s short-lived series Molloy. Before long, Jennifer’s television resume had grown to include appearances in The Edge, a role in the ultimately unsuccessful attempt at adapting Ferris Bueller’s Day Off into sitcom format, and a part in an episode of Quantum Leap. In 1991, she landed a recurring role on Herman’s Head, while 1994 led her to a role in Muddling Through, the show that almost kept her from starring in Friends.
By 1994, it looked like Aniston was destined for a life of obscure parts in doomed television sitcoms. Despite being asked to audition for the role of Monica Gellar in a pilot for a sitcom at that point titled “Friends Like These” (a role that would eventually be filled by Courteney Cox), Aniston insisted on trying out for the part of Rachel Green, a spoiled suburbanite turned spunky coffee house waitress. The rest, as they say, is history — “Friends Like These” would become the mega-hit Friends.
Friends quickly inspired an obsessive following, as did Aniston’s signature hairstyle. Just as “The Rachel” fell out of popularity in the salons, Aniston began scoring roles in a series of romantic comedies – , She’s the One (1996), Picture Perfect (1997), ‘Til There Was You (1997), and The Object of My Affection (1998). She met fellow actor Brad Pitt in 1997, on a blind date set up by their agents. Jennifer married her boyfriend of 2 and a half years on July 29, 2000 in Malibu, California. Since their marriage, the two young stars took their place among Hollywood’s elite power couples. 
She became estranged from her mother, Nancy Aniston ( Nancy Dow ), who made unflattering statements about her in a tabloid and later published a book called “From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir” in which she talked about her daughter’s life once more. Her mother wasn’t invited to her wedding because of that. However, Jennifer has been on friendly terms with her mother since fall 2005 (“We’ve exchanged messages. Our doors are open. We’re taking baby steps. It’s a good thing.” – Vanity Fair, September 2005).
relatively well-received supporting role in 1999′s Office Space. Though Rock Star was far from a massive success, Aniston’s talent for dramatic roles was finally given a proper outlet, and she went on to land the lead part in 2002′s The Good Girl. Receiving rave reviews for her portrayal as Justine Last, she was nominated for an Independent Spriti award as Best Female Lead and won the Teen Choice Awards in the Choice Movie Actress – Drama/Action Adventure category in 2003. 
A year later, Jennifer starred alongside Jim Carrey in the romantic comedy Bruce Almighty, which became the years most watched comedy ($484,592,874 total gross with an estimated budget of $81,000,000!), and Friends began its final season. At one point in 2003, Jennifer was filming “Friends” (1994), Bruce Almighty (2003), and Along Came Polly (2004) simultaneously.
In January of 2004, Aniston starred in the number 1 comedy in America. Along Came Polly grossed 26.7 million dollars in its first weekend, knocking Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King out of the top spot at the box office. January also marked the end of our beloved Friends. The last episode ever of the hit sitcom was taped on January 23rd. In the US, 52.5 million viewers watched the finale on May 6, 2004, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast since the Seinfeld finale in 1998.
On June 13, 2004, Coco Riley Arquette, daughter of Jennifer’s friends Courteney Cox and David Arquette was born. Jennifer is Coco’s godmother. Jennifer sees her goddaughter almost every weekend because she regularly visits her friends.
After Along Came Polly and the end of Friends, Jennifer took some time off until she started filming Rumor Has It… from July 21 to October 26, 2004 and right after that her first thriller, Derailed, alongside Clive Owen from September to December 2004. It was filmed mainly in Chicago and London.
In January 2005, Jennifer and Brad Pitt announced their separation after 4 1/2 years of marriage. Divorce papers were filed on March 25th by Jennifer, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized on October 2, 2005. The two remained co-owners of their production company Plan B with producer Brad Grey for about a year. Jennifer is said to have left the company at that point because it grew too rapidly for her liking. 
Jennifer is the first ever woman to be honored on the cover in the 10-year history of GQ’s “Men of the Year” issue series. She appeared on the cover of their November 2005 issue. The other, actual men of the year were 50 Cent and her The Break-Up co-star, Vince Vaughn.
Filming the independent movie Friends with Money, her first movie since the announcement of her separation with Brad Pitt, proved to be a very difficult task for everyone involved. The media scrutiny was overwhelming. Some paparazzi can be seen in a scene of the movie. In 2006, she released Friends with Money and the big hit with the ironic title The Break-Up. Friends with Money premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and got mixed reviews, mainly praising her portrayal of Olivia. The Break-Up was her first big hit after Friends, with a total of $204,999,686 at the box office worldwide. Jennifer and her co-star Vince Vaughn won a Teen Choice Award for Movies – Choice Chemistry in 2006. She met Vince Vaughn on the set of The Break-Up and dated him for over a year. They mutually agreed to end their relationship in December 2006.
The same year, Jennifer adopted Dolly, a white German shepherd. She is her second dog. Norman, a Welsh Corgi-terrier mix, was born around 1996. While Norman is happy to lie at his mom’s feet, Dolly prefers Jennifer’s lap.
In 2006, Jennifer also made her directorial debut with the short film Room 10, starring Robin Wright Penn and Kris Kristofferson. She directed it with her longtime friend Andrea Buchanan. It was based on Glamour reader Colleen Goldrick’s real life story. Jennifer has mentioned that she was inspired by Gwyneth Paltrow who directed a short a year earlier. The film got great reviews and was shown at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, CineVegas International Film Festival, and the Rhode Island International Film Festival.
Membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (also known as the Oscars) is by invitation only. In 2007, Jennifer was one of 115 people who were invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has 5,835 voting members, with actors constituting the largest voting bloc.
After her much buzzed about appearance on best friend Courteney Cox’s FX show Dirt in March 2007, Jennifer had another guest spot on television. She was nominated for an Emmy as Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her role of Claire Harper on 30 Rock (November 2008).
Management was filmed from October to November 2007 but didn’t have a limited release in the USA earlier than May 5, 2009. However, it premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 2008. It was another independent movie for Jennifer.
In September of 2007, Jennifer shot He’s Just Not That Into You, a box office success worldwide. It was released a year later around Valentine’s Day. The movie had an all-star cast, including Ben Affleck (as Jennifer’s boyfriend), Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Connelly, Bradley Cooper, Scarlett Johansson, Kris Kristofferson and others. Jennifer was the only one of the cast to be nominated for an award (People’s Choice and Teen Choice Awards 2009/2010).
In March 2008, Jennifer and her longtime friend Kristin Hahn, officially formed Echo Films, a production company that will focus on “stories about people finding their voice and finding their way because they help us as listeners.”
The same month, she started shooting Marley & Me in Floria, Ireland and Pennsylvania. The movie opened with a record on Christmas Day 2008 and grossed $242,717,113 worldwide. The movie is based on the best-selling book by John Grogan. Jennifer was nominated for her portrayal of Jenny Grogan at the Kids’ Choice Awards and Teen Choice Awards in 2009.
A year later, in March 2009, Jennifer broke up with her on-off-boyfriend, singer John Mayer. They had been dating since March 2008, broke up in August the same year, got back together in October. They appeared on the red carpet of the Oscars together in February 2009. A month later, they called it quits.
In Love Happens, the main character of the movie is played by Aaron Eckhart, making Jennifer’s role more of a supporting role. Due to tough competition, it didn’t do all that well at the box office. But it did bring in more than its budget, so it was a successful small movie.
2010 promised to be a very busy year for Jennifer. She had two movies to promote that year with The Bounty Hunter (co-starring Gerard Butler) and The Switch (co-starring Jason Bateman) while shooting Just Go With It with Adam Sandler in the summer.
Her fragrance called “Jennifer Aniston” made its debut at Harrod’s in London in the summer of 2010. It was originally slated to be called “Lolavie” – a personal meaning for Jennifer – but it sounded too much like Marc Jacobs’ “Lola” and her name was the only thing they could clear quickly enough. In May 2011, it celebrated its US debut at Sephora in New York. Proceeds go to one of Jennifer’s favorite charities, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.
On her birthday in 2011, on February 11, Just Go With It came out in theaters. It is one of Jen’s most successful films, box office- wise. It has made $214,945,591 worldwide and co-stars her friend of over 20 years, Adam Sandler as well as Nicole Kidman, Brooklyn Decker and Nick Swardson.
In March of 2011, a Smartwater ad with Jennifer was expected to gain about 1 million hits on YouTube but surprised the producers by quickly getting over 9 million hits. It’s a parody of other YouTube videos and was a very successful ad for Jen as their spokesperson.
Jennifer has sold her 10,000 square feet Los Angeles home and has said that she is looking for a place in New York. Rumor has it she has already found an apartment in the West Village. She still has her old house from her Friends days and has thought of renovating that one, so she seems likely to live a bi-coastal life if all rumors are true.
She rightfully received the Decade of Hotness award at the Spike Guys Choice Awards in June 2011 and “being this side of 40, [the honor] is not lost on [her].” Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day presented her the award. She thanked her friend and yoga instructor, Mandy Ingber and promised to “downdog [...] until the fat lady sings.”
Jennifer gained a lot of critical acclaim for her role in Horrible Bosses, in which she plays Charlie Day’s sex-obsessed dentist boss. The film also stars Jason Bateman (making this their third time working together after The Break-Up and The Switch), Jason Sudeikis, Jamie Foxx, Colin Farrell and Kevin Spacey.
On July 8, 2011 (coinciding with the release of Horrible Bosses), she had the honor of placing her hand and footprints in concrete at Grauman’s Chinese Theater in front of friends, fans and journalists. Her friends Chelsea Handler and Jason Bateman held speeches about her while other friends such as Andrea Bendewald, Chris McMillan, boyfriend Justin Theroux and Kristin Hahn watched on. Jennifer has also been announced as one of the stars to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2012.
On October 7, 2011, Wanderlust will be released in the US. The film co-stars an old friend, Paul Rudd, as well as Jennifer’s current boyfriend Justin Theroux. This will be Jennifer’s second R-rated movie in 2011 after Horrible Bosses.
Jennifer’s publicist has said that she will start her next film in the winter. She is keeping herself with busy with traveling plans and her production company Echo Films.

Jennifer Joanna Aniston (born February 11, 1969) is an American actress. She became famous in the 1990s for her role as Rachel Green in the US sitcom Friends, a role for which she won an Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award.She has starred in many Hollywood films. While most of her film roles have been in comedies such as Bruce Almighty, Office Space, Rumor Has It, and the romantic comedies Along Came Polly and The Break-Up, she has also appeared in films from other genres such as the horror-comedy Leprechaun, the crime thriller Derailed and the musical drama Rock Star.Aniston moved to Hollywood and was cast in her first television role in 1990, starring as a regular on the short-lived series Molloy and in the TV movie Camp Cucamonga. She also co-starred in Ferris Bueller, a television adaptation of the 1986 hit movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off. The series, however, was quickly canceled. Aniston then appeared in two more failed television comedy shows, The Edge and Muddling Through, and guest-starred on Quantum Leap, Herman's Head, and Burke's Law. After the string of canceled shows, along with her appearance in the critically derided 1992 horror film, Leprechaun, Aniston considered giving up acting. Aniston's plans changed, however, after auditioning for Friends, a sitcom that was set to debut on NBC's 19941995 fall line-up. The producers of the show originally wanted Aniston to audition for the role of Monica Geller, but Courteney Cox was considered to be better suited to the role. Thus, Aniston was cast as Rachel Green. She played the character of Rachel from 1994 until the show ended in 2004.Forbes listed Aniston as the 10th richest woman in the entertainment industry for the year 2007. She is behind such powerhouses as Oprah Winfrey, J. K. Rowling, Madonna, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion and Jennifer Lopez and is ahead of Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and the Olsen twins. Aniston's net worth is approximately $110 million. Aniston was also included in the annual Star Salary Top 10 of trade magazine The Hollywood Reporter for 2006. According to Forbes in October 2007, Aniston was the top-selling celebrity face of the entertainment industry.
