 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Alicia Silverstone was born on October 4, 1976 in San Francisco, California, the youngest of three children to Monty Silverstone, a real-estate investor, and Didi Silverstone, a former flight attendant. Alicia's career began at the tender age of six when her father took some photos of his young daughter, which eventually led to her getting several television commercials. After a guest spot on The Wonder Years (1988) as a literal "dream girl", she moved on to movies. She landed a role in The Crush (1993), a sort of Fatal Attraction (1987) for teenagers in which she portrayed a disturbed young girl obsessed with an older man. The nasty little role did not impress the critical establishment but it wowed its target audience: teenagers. In fact, the role won her the 1994 MTV Movie Award for "Best Villain" and "Breakthrough Performance". It is interesting to note that during the filming of the movie, Alicia became an emancipated minor in order to get around child labor laws which would have interfered with her working hours. She was a dedicated actress from early on.The film also caught the attention of Aerosmith, who hired her to appear in a string of their music videos. The first of them, "Cryin'", was voted the #1 video of all time on MTV. Silverstone was definitely a hit with the MTV crowd, but larger commercial success still eluded her. That all changed when she landed the role of Cher in Amy Heckerling's Clueless (1995). Cher was the antithesis of Alicia's role in The Crush; this time around, she was a rich, naive yet endearing girl from Beverly Hills in search of love in the 1990s. The film was a huge box-office hit and wowed both audiences and critics alike and demonstrated Alicia's strength and bankability. She was hailed as the woman of the hour, and branded the spokeswoman for an emerging young generation. She signed a deal with Columbia TriStar worth $10 million and got the coveted role of Batgirl in the Batman franchise. Also, as part of the package, she got a three-year first-look deal for her own production company, First Kiss Productions. The first film released by First Kiss was Excess Baggage (1997).
      Refuses to appear nude in any of her movies. She requires a body double in her place for nude scenes. Also, when starring in the stage version of "The Graduate," she insisted on wearing underwear for the famous nude-scene. The producers were forced to let her do this because, otherwise, she would have resigned from the show.
      Was offered the role of Valerie Malone, on Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990). Since it was the beginning of her career, Alicia turned it down, and Tiffani Thiessen got the role instead. [1994]
      Her father was born in London, to an Ashkenazi Jewish family. Her mother, who is originally from Scotland, converted to Judaism.
      Became legally emancipated at 15 in order to work the hours required for the shooting schedule of The Crush (1993)
      Was turned down for the lead in My Father the Hero (1994). They said she was too heavy for the part. The role went to Katherine Heigl.
      The Plain English Campaign awarded her the annual Foot in Mouth Award in 2000 for her 'baffling verbal statement', "I think that Clueless (1995) was very deep. I think it was deep in the way that it was very light. I think lightness has to come from a very deep place if it is true lightness".
      She is an animal rights activist. During the filming of Clueless (1995), she adopted a raggedy old mutt, whom she found wandering the streets of Los Angeles. She named him "Samson," and kept him on the set.
      In answer to the question 'Is it true that you like to do gardening naked?' in the UK's 'Radio Times' magazine (22.5.04) she said, 'Yes, that is something that I enjoy doing. I don't know how you know about that but it's ... not untrue. It's just that if it's really hot and you're in LA, and you happen to be doing some gardening -- your clothes come off. I also like to swim naked and trampoline naked and do all those kind of things'.
      Got a surprise grab-and-smooch by Jim Carrey at the 1997 MTV Movie Awards when she presented the Best Comedic Performance award to Carrey. Carrey apologized to her backstage after realizing that she felt very humiliated.
      Is widely credited for popularizing navel piercing due to her prominent role in the Aerosmith music video, "Cryin", where her rebellious character gets her navel pierced. The piercing shown in the video did happen on set.
      Returned to work 2 months after giving birth to her son Bear to begin filming Gods Behaving Badly (2013).
      (June 11, 2005) Married her boyfriend of 8 years Christopher Jarecki following a 16-month-long engagement.
      Gave birth to her 1st child at age 34, a son Bear Blu Jarecki on May 5, 2011. Child's father is her husband, Christopher Jarecki.
      On Broadway as "Mandy" in "Time Stands Still", a new play by Donald Margulies, directed by Danie Sullivan. With Eric Bogosian, Brian d'Arcy James and Laura Linney. [February 2010]
      I don't feel like a dream girl, but I think it's really nice. I guess a part of me wishes I got that sort of attention in my real life. Because in my real life, I'm this weird, dorky girl who just hangs out with her dog.
      I think that Clueless (1995) was very deep. I think it was deep in the way that it was very light. I think lightness has to come from a very deep place if it's true lightness.
      "My boyfriend calls me 'princess', but I think of myself more along the lines of 'monkey' and 'retard'".
      On her 'chocolate is better than sex' quote: "I was interviewed when I was 17 and I didn't actually say that. It was the worst piece of journalism that I've ever been involved with."
      Some days I wake up and think 'what's wrong' and I'd realize it's nothing other than waking up in a not so great a mood. Generally I feel good though. I go to yoga, I feel great. I love to wake up on Sundays - just hang out with the dogs.
      My parents taught me about other cultures. I spent time in Africa, Cuba, Europe, Jamaica, the Amazon and that was nothing to do with work.
      To be put in a position at 15 where people are saying how sexy you are is really awkward, so I did all I could to try and diffuse that. It's only now that I've started to feel like I've become a lady.
      I'm not obsessed with being in the public eye. It's not my job to impress people - I'm really just a working actress and I like to pick projects and do things that really inspire me.
      The things that move me and excite me aren't necessarily going to be box-office hits all the time. My favorite film I've ever done was Love's Labour's Lost (2000) and I think - in box-office terms - barely one person saw it. But I still think it's the greatest movie and I don't care if anybody doesn't like it. I saw it in seven different countries and the audience would leave the theatre dancing. I think that's a pretty incredible thing.
      I think people that genuinely do good are great people. And I don't think, "Oh, there must be something wrong with them". I think that there's something wrong with the people who aren't doing good.
      Everything you do in the name of the environment not only saves your health, it saves your soul.
      [on Clueless (1995)] Cher Horowitz knows she's the most beautiful, most obviously important person in the world-her world-yet he doesn't really know about the rest of the world. She evolve in the film and sees there's more to life than her wardrobe. Cher eventually realizes she's beautiful because of who she is inside, not because of her appearance.
      [on River Phoenix] I loved River Phoenix so much. I never met him, but I wanted to marry him. So if we'd ever been stuck in an elevator, all I would want to do is make him fall in love with me. [1995 "The Scene" Magazine]
=======================================================
Alicia Silverstone (/əˈliːsiə ˈsɪlvərstoʊn/; born October 4, 1976) is an American actress, producer, author, and activist.[1] Silverstone made her film debut in The Crush, earning the 1994 MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance, and gained further prominence as a teen idol when she appeared in three music videos for the band Aerosmith. She starred in the 1995 sleeper hit Clueless (which earned her a multi-million-dollar deal with Columbia) and in the big-budget 1997 film Batman & Robin, in which she played Batgirl. She has continued to act in film and television and on stage. A vegan, Silverstone endorsed PETA activities and published a book titled The Kind Diet.
Silverstone was born in San Francisco, California, the daughter of British parents Deirdre "Didi" (née Radford), a Scottish former Pan Am flight attendant, and Monty Silverstone, an English real estate agent.[2][3] She grew up in Hillsborough, California.[4] Her father was born to a Jewish family and her mother converted to Conservative Judaism before marriage.[5] Silverstone began modeling when she was six years old,[6] and was subsequently cast in television commercials, the first being for Domino's Pizza.[7] She attended Crocker Middle School and then San Mateo High School.[8]
Silverstone won several awards for her film performances. She received multiple MTV Movie Awards and a Young Artist Award for The Crush. For Clueless she received multiple MTV Movie Awards and a Young Artist Award once again, plus awards from Blockbuster Entertainment Award, Kids' Choice Awards, National Board of Review, and an American Comedy Award.[9]
Her first credited acting role was in The Wonder Years starring Fred Savage in the episode entitled "Road Test", as Savage's high school "dream girl". Silverstone then won a leading part in the 1993 film The Crush, playing a teenaged girl who sets out to ruin an older man after he spurns her affections; she won two awards at the 1994 MTV Movie Awards for the role—Best Breakthrough Performance and Best Villain.[4] Silverstone became legally emancipated at the age of 15 in order to work the hours required for the shooting schedule of the film.[7] Silverstone made some television movies in her early career including Torch Song, Cool and the Crazy[4] and Scattered Dreams.
After seeing her in The Crush, Marty Callner decided Silverstone would be perfect for a role in a music video he was directing for the band Aerosmith, called "Cryin'"; she was subsequently cast in two more videos, "Amazing" and "Crazy." These were hugely successful for both the band and Silverstone, making her a household name (and also gaining her the nickname, "the Aerosmith chick").[10] After seeing Silverstone in the three videos, filmmaker Amy Heckerling decided to cast her in Clueless.[11]
Clueless became a sleeper hit and critical darling during the summer of 1995.[12] As a result, she signed a deal with Columbia-TriStar valued between $8 and $10 million.[13][14] As part of the package, she got a three-year first look deal for her own production company, First Kiss Productions. Silverstone also won "Best Female Performance" and "Most Desirable Female" at the 1996 MTV Movie Awards for her performance in the film. In the same year Silverstone starred in the erotic thriller, The Babysitter,[4] film adaptation of the novel by Dean Koontz, Hideaway, and the French drama about Americans, New World.
Silverstone's next role was as Batgirl in Batman & Robin, and while it was not a critical success,[15] the film grossed $238,207,122 worldwide.[16] Silverstone's turn as Batgirl was not well received, and won her a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress.[17] She also, however, won a Blimp Award at the Kid's Choice Awards for the role. Also released in 1997 was Excess Baggage, the first movie by Silverstone's production company, First Kiss Productions. She starred alongside Benicio del Toro and Christopher Walken.[2]
In 1999, Silverstone starred in the Saturn Award-nominated romance/comedy film Blast from the Past which also stars Brendan Fraser, Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek. In VH1's 40 Hottest Hotties of the '90s she was ranked #5.[18]
In 2000, Silverstone appeared in Kenneth Branagh's film adaptation of the Shakespeare play Love's Labour's Lost, in which she was required to sing and dance. In 2001, Silverstone provided the voice of Sharon Spitz, the lead character in the Canadian animated television Braceface. During this time, she also appeared in the films Global Heresy and Scorched. In 2002, she made her Broadway debut alongside Kathleen Turner and Jason Biggs in The Graduate.[4] After removing herself from the public eye for a few years, she resurfaced in the short-lived 2003 NBC television series Miss Match, which was canceled after 11 episodes. Silverstone later acknowledged that she hates the trappings of fame, saying, "Fame is not anything I wish on anyone. You start acting because you love it. Then success arrives, and suddenly you're on show".[19]
After the cancellation of Miss Match in 2003, Silverstone did a pilot with Fox called Queen B, in which she played a former high school prom queen named Beatrice (Bea) who has discovered that the real world is nothing like high school.[20] It was not picked up for production. In 2005, she co-starred with Queen Latifah in Beauty Shop, a spinoff of the BarberShop films, as one of the stylists in the beauty shop.[4] In the same year, she played a reporter alongside Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze, Jr. in Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, which did well financially, and appeared in the direct-to-video film Silence Becomes You.[4]
In 2006, Silverstone starred in an ABC pilot called Pink Collar, in which her character worked in a law firm. Like Queen B, this pilot was not picked up for syndication. That year, she also starred alongside Alex Pettyfer, Ewan McGregor and Mickey Rourke in the film Stormbreaker, and appeared in the Hallmark Hall of Fame made-for-TV movie Candles on Bay Street, based on the book by Cathie Pelletier.[4] Silverstone continued her theatre work, next appearing in David Mamet's Boston Marriage and Speed-the-Plow. In 2008, she filmed another ABC pilot alongside Megan Mullally called Bad Mother's Handbook and made a cameo appearance in the comedy film Tropic Thunder.[4]
In early 2009, Silverstone starred in the world premiere of Donald Margulies's Time Stands Still at the Geffen Playhouse LA.[21] The play focuses on a longtime couple and journalistic team who return to New York from an extended stint in the war-torn Middle East. She also starred in the music video for Rob Thomas's 2009 single "Her Diamonds".[22]
Silverstone filmed a small segment in Elektra Luxx, a sequel to Women In Trouble. Director Sebastian Gutierrez cut her segment but will possibly use it for a third installment, tentatively titled Women In Ecstasy.[23]
In 2010, she reprised her role in Time Stands Still alongside Laura Linney in the New York production of the play on Broadway, which premiered on January 28, 2010, directed by Daniel Sullivan, who described Silverstone as "a breath of fresh air."[24] The play received good reviews with The New York Times praising Silverstone, saying she "brings warmth, actorly intelligence and delicate humour."[25]
Silverstone next starred in the teen romance The Art of Getting By,[26] which premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival.[27] and appeared in four episodes of Suburgatory, reuniting with her Clueless castmate Jeremy Sisto.[28]
Her next role was in Butter as the adoptive mother of a 12-year old African American girl who enters a local butter sculpture competition in a small Iowa town. Rob Corddry, who plays her husband, invited her to appear in an episode of his show Childrens Hospital.[29] She also reunited with Clueless director Amy Heckerling in Vamps, playing one of two vampires who fall in love and face a choice that could jeopardise their immortality.[30] She was offered the role after Heckerling came to see her in Time Stands Still.[31]
Silverstone later returned to Broadway in the 2012 New York production of The Performers[32] and starred in Angels in Stardust.,[33] and Ass Backwards.[34][35] In 2013, she shot TV pilot HR,[36] which was not picked up.[37]
Silverstone has two older siblings, a half-sister from her father's previous marriage named Kezi Silverstone and a brother named David Silverstone. She married her longtime boyfriend, rock musician Christopher Jarecki, in a beachfront ceremony at Lake Tahoe on June 11, 2005.[39] After meeting outside a movie theater in 1997, the couple dated for eight years prior to their marriage.[40] They got engaged about a year before their marriage, and Jarecki presented Silverstone with an engagement ring that had belonged to his grandmother.[41] They live in an eco-friendly Los Angeles house, complete with solar panels and an organic vegetable garden.[40] Silverstone bought the house, shared with a "menagerie of rescued dogs", in 1996.[41]
In 2009, Silverstone released The Kind Diet, a guide to vegan nutrition, and launched its associated website The Kind Life.[42][43] The Kind Diet has topped the Hardcover Advice & Misc. category of The New York Times Best Seller list.[44] She plans to write two follow up books, The Kind Mama and The Kind Diet Cookbook.[45]
In January 2011, it was announced that Silverstone and Jarecki were expecting their first child together.[46] In May 2011, Silverstone gave birth to a boy, whom they named Bear Blu Jarecki.[47] In March 2012 she uploaded video of herself feeding pre-chewed food to her son from her own mouth, a process called premastication.[48][49] In response to criticism, she made a statement that it's been going on for thousands of years, and is perfectly natural.[50]
Silverstone is noted for being an animal rights and environmental activist. She became a vegan in 1998 after attending an animal rights meeting, saying "I realized that I was the problem … I was an animal lover who was eating animals."[40] She has stated she struggled with childhood vegetarianism, stating "at eight years old it's hard to stick to your guns – and so through the years I was always starting and stopping trying to be a vegetarian."[51] In 2004, Silverstone was voted "Sexiest Female Vegetarian" by PETA.[52] In 2007, Silverstone appeared nude in a print advertisement and 30-second commercial for PETA championing vegetarianism; the TV spot was subsequently pulled from the Houston, Texas market by Comcast Cable.[53] Silverstone has set up a sanctuary for rescued pets in Los Angeles.[54] In 2012, during the trial of Russian band Pussy Riot, she wrote a letter to Vladimir Putin asking that vegan meals be made available to all Russian prisoners.[55]
Federal campaign contribution records list Silverstone contributing $500 USD to Dennis Kucinich's 2004 presidential campaign.[56] She also supported Barack Obama's presidential candidacy.[57]
In 2009, she appeared in "A Gaythering Storm", a Funny or Die spoof internet video parodying anti-same-sex marriage commercial "The Gathering Storm."[58] She also appeared in "My Mother's Red Hat" with Alanis Morissette parodying indie movies.
She was awarded a Heart Of Green Award in 2009, which "recognizes individuals, organizations or companies who have helped green go mainstream."[60] In 2010, she was awarded a Voice Of Compassion Award by the Physician's Committee For Responsible Medicine for "shining a spotlight on the powerful health benefits of a vegan diet."[61]

"Success to me," Silverstone says, "is not about how much money I make or how much attention I get. To me, I'm successful because I have five dogs, great friends, and because I'm generally a happy person." 
Silverstone was born in San Francisco, California. Her career began at the age of six when a series of swimsuit snapshots taken by her real estate investor father turned into modeling gigs, then TV commercials, then guest spots on sitcoms and, finally, a little movie called The Crush where she played a Lolita who makes life a living hell for the object of her affection. That movie didn't do well at the box office, but it did generate a buzz for Silverstone, as did the Aerosmith videos she performed in with her friend (and daughter of Aerosmith's Steve Tyler) Liv Tyler. But it was her great comedic performance in Clueless that really made Silverstone into a star and got her a $10 million deal with Columbia Pictures to produce her own films. "Unfortunately," she says, "being a female in this business, to do the things you want, you have to create for yourself. I'm not going to stand around being one of the people that goes, 'Poor women in Hollywood' because that's boring and totally useless." 
Silverstone, a long-time vegan and a spokesperson for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, made her Broadway debut in 2002 playing the daughter of Kathleen Turner's character, Mrs. Robinson, in the stage version of The Graduate. Returning to the big screen, she played a pesky reporter in Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004), and starred as a lawyer in her own sitcom for NBC-TV, entitled Miss Match for the 2003/2004 TV season. When it didn't last the season, she concentrated on film with roles in Beauty Shop and Silence Becomes You (both 2005). 
She married her boyfriend of eight years, musician Christopher Jarecki, on June 11, 2005 in Lake Tahoe. She gave birth to their first child, a boy named Bear Blu, on May 5, 2011.

Alicia Silverstone wants your breast milk.The Clueless star recently launched Kind Mama Milk Share, a breast milk exchange program to help out vegan parents in need. Silverstone was inspired to create the program after hearing about a friend who couldn't produce enough breast milk and had a hard time learning about the lifestyle choices of donors.
Imagine a world in which the NFL, the NBA and Major League Baseball all decided to move their seasons to the same time of year. It would be chaos, for fans and the professional sports business alike. And yet, in television, that's essentially what happens during pilot season.
The broadcast networks traditionally order pilots during the first few months of the year. From there, it's a race to find the best actors, hire a crew, build sets and produce a show before May, when the upcoming fall schedules are announced. The field has always been crowded, but this spring, several cable networks and online retailer-turned-programmer Amazon are also developing new shows that they hope will go to series (cable networks typically produce pilots throughout the year, usually avoiding the spring).
Do you still keep an argyle miniskirt in your closet? Are you sporting a short pixie haircut? Or maybe, you're all about Wayfarer sunglasses? If you said yes to any of these questions, then you have Hollywood to thank for your keen style. On Monday, Feb. 18 at 9/8c, TV Guide Network will spotlight these and more on Iconic Movie Looks, a brand-new one-hour special.
The pressure is on for Suburgatory this coming season. On-screen, the family comedy is preparing to introduce the long-gone mom of Tessa (Jane Levy) as well as finally put will-they-or-won't-they couple George (Jeremy Sisto) and Dallas (Cheryl Hines) together. Off-screen, the family comedy is in the hot seat (in a good way) after a last-minute bump on the fall schedule from 8:30/7:30c to the coveted post-Modern Family spot of 9:30/8:30c.
"I'm still trying to figure out what I should send [ABC Entertainment President] Paul Lee as a thank you gift," creator and executive producer Emily Kapnek says. "It's not just a huge opportunity, but a good fit. We were a little bit edgy at times for...

Alicia SilverstoneActorBorn: 4 October 1976Birthplace: San Francisco, CaliforniaBest known as: The star of the movie CluelessThe film Clueless made Alicia Silverstone one of Hollywood's hottest actresses for a brief moment in 1995. Alicia Silverstone had already made a small splash in 1993, frolicking with Liv Tyler as a sexy teen truant in the music video for the Aerosmith song "Crazy." Two years later she played Cher, the frothy social butterfly in Clueless, a romantic comedy loosely based on Jane Austen's book Emma. Clueless was a smash and Silverstone quickly signed a multi-million dollar studio deal and set up her own production company, but she never found another role that suited her so well. She appeared as Batgirl in Batman and Robin (1997, with George Clooney as Batman), as another sexy truant in Excess Baggage (1997, with Benicio Del Toro) and as the love interest in the comedy Blast From the Past (1999, with Christopher Walken), then had lesser roles in films like Beauty Shop (2005, with Queen Latifah), Stormbreaker (2006) and The Art of Getting By (2011). On television, Alicia Silverstone starred as a lovelorn matchmaker in the 2003 series Miss Match. In later years she has remade herself as a vegan lifestyle guru, publishing the cookbook The Kind Diet in 2009.Extra credit: Alicia Silverstone married rock 'n roll singer Christopher Jarecki in 2005. Their first child, a son named Bear Blu Jarecki, was born on 5 May 2011... Alicia Silverstone dropped out of Hollywood High, but later got her GED... The role of Batgirl was played by Yvonne Craig in the 1960's Batman TV series...
