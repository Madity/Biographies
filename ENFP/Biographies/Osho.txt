Chandra Mohan Jain ( pronunciation (help·info); 11 December 1931 – 19 January 1990), also known as Acharya Rajneesh from the 1960s onwards, as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh ( pronunciation (help·info)) during the 1970s and 1980s, and as Osho from 1989, was an Indian mystic, guru and spiritual teacher. His international following has continued beyond his death.
A professor of philosophy, he travelled throughout India during the 1960s as a public speaker. His outspoken criticism of politicians and the political mind, Mahatma Gandhi and institutionalised religion made him controversial. He advocated a more open attitude towards sexuality, a stance which earned him the sobriquet of "sex guru" in the Indian and (later) international press.[1] In 1970 Rajneesh settled for a time in Bombay, initiating disciples (known as neo-sannyasins) and assuming the role of spiritual teacher. In his discourses he reinterpreted the writings of religious traditions, mystics and philosophers from around the world. Moving to Pune in 1974, he established an ashram which attracted a growing number of Westerners. The ashram offered therapies derived from the Human Potential Movement to its Western audience and made news in India and abroad because of its permissive climate and Rajneesh's provocative lectures. By the late 1970s, tensions were mounting with the Indian government and the surrounding society.
In mid-1981, Rajneesh relocated to the United States, where his followers established an intentional community (later known as Rajneeshpuram) near Antelope, Oregon south of The Dalles, Oregon. Almost immediately, the commune's leadership became embroiled in conflicts with local residents (primarily over land use), which were marked by hostility on both sides. The large number of Rolls-Royce cars purchased for Rajneesh's use by his followers also attracted criticism. The Oregon commune collapsed in 1985 when Rajneesh revealed that the commune leadership had committed a number of serious crimes, including a bioterror attack (food contamination) on the citizens of The Dalles.[2] He was arrested shortly afterwards, and charged with immigration violations. Rajneesh was deported from the United States in accordance with a plea bargain.[3][4][5] Twenty-one countries denied him entry, causing Rajneesh to travel the world before returning to Pune, where he died in 1990.
Rajneesh's ashram in Pune is today known as the Osho International Meditation Resort. His syncretic teachings emphasise the importance of meditation, awareness, love, celebration, courage, creativity and humour: qualities which he viewed as suppressed by adherence to static belief systems, religious tradition and socialisation. Rajneesh's teachings have had a notable influence on Western spirituality, as well as New Age thought.[6][7] Their popularity has increased since his death.[8][9]
Rajneesh was born Chandra Mohan Jain (the eldest of eleven children of a cloth merchant and his wife) at his maternal grandparents' house in Kuchwada, a small Indian village in the Raisen district of Madhya Pradesh State.[10][11][12] His parents, Babulal and Saraswati Jain (Taranpanthi Jains), let him live with his maternal grandparents until he was seven years old.[13] By Rajneesh's account, this was a major influence on his development; his grandmother gave him unbridled freedom and imposed no education on him.[14] When he was seven his grandfather died, and Chandra went to Gadarwara to live with his parents.[10][15] Rajneesh was profoundly affected by his grandfather's death and the death of his childhood girlfriend (his cousin Shashi) from typhoid when he was 15. His preoccupation with death lasted through much of his youth.[15][16] He was a gifted though rebellious school student, and acquired a reputation as a formidable debater.[17] Rajneesh became an anti-theist, was interested in hypnosis, and was briefly associated with socialism.
In 1951, aged nineteen, Rajneesh began his studies at Hitkarini College in Jabalpur.[18] Asked to leave after conflicts with an instructor, he transferred to D. N. Jain College in Jabalpur.[19] Disruptively argumentative, he was not required to attend classes at D. N. Jain College (except for examinations); he used his free time to work as an assistant editor for a local newspaper.[20] He began speaking in public at the annual Sarva Dharma Sammelan (meeting of all faiths) at Jabalpur, organised by the Teranpanthi Jain community into which he was born. He participated there from 1951 to 1968.[21] He resisted parental pressure to marry.[22] Rajneesh later said he became spiritually enlightened on 21 March 1953, at age 21, in a mystical experience while sitting under a tree in the Bhanvartal Garden in Jabalpur.[23]
After completing his B.A. in philosophy at D. N. Jain College in 1955, he joined the University of Sagar, where in 1957 he earned his M.A. with distinction in philosophy.[24] He secured a teaching post at Raipur Sanskrit College; however, the vice-chancellor soon asked him to seek a transfer since he considered him a danger to his students' morality, character and religion.[25]
Beginning in 1958 he lectured in philosophy at Jabalpur University, and was promoted to professor in 1960.[25] A popular lecturer, he was acknowledged by his peers as an exceptionally intelligent man who had overcome the deficiencies of a small-town education.[26]
Concurrent with his university job, Rajneesh traveled throughout India under the name Acharya Rajneesh (Acharya means teacher, or professor; Rajneesh was a nickname he acquired in childhood), presenting lectures critical of socialism and Gandhi.[17][25][27] He said socialism would only socialise poverty, and described Gandhi as a masochist reactionary who worshipped poverty.[17][27] What India needed to prosper were capitalism, science, technology and birth control.[17] He criticised orthodox Indian religions as dead, filled with empty ritual and oppressing their followers with fears of damnation and promises of blessings.[17][27] Such statements made him controversial, but gained him a loyal following which included wealthy merchants and businessmen.[17][28] They arranged individual consultations about their spiritual development and daily life in return for donations (a common arrangement in India), and his practice grew rapidly.[28] In 1962, he began to lead three- to ten-day meditation camps; the first meditation centres (Jivan Jagruti Kendra) emerged around his teaching, then known as the Life Awakening Movement (Jivan Jagruti Andolan).[29] After a controversial speaking tour in 1966, he resigned from his teaching post at the request of the university.[25]
After calling for a greater acceptance of sex in a 1968 lecture series (later published as From Sex to Superconsciousness), Rajneesh was dubbed "the sex guru" by the Indian press. His talks scandalised Hindu leaders.[30][1]
When invited (despite the misgivings of some Hindu leaders) to speak at the Second World Hindu Conference in 1969, he said that "any religion which considers life meaningless and full of misery, and teaches the hatred of life, is not a true religion. Religion is an art that shows how to enjoy life".[30][31] He characterised priests as being motivated by self-interest, provoking the shankaracharya of Puri to attempt (in vain) to have his lecture stopped.[31]
At a public meditation event in spring 1970, Rajneesh presented his Dynamic Meditation method for the first time.[32] He left Jabalpur for Mumbai at the end of June.[33] On 26 September 1970, he initiated his first group of disciples (or neo-sannyasins).[34] Becoming a disciple meant assuming a new name and wearing the traditional orange dress of ascetic Hindu holy men, as well as a mala (beaded necklace) holding a locket with his picture.[35] However, his sannyasins were encouraged to follow a celebratory (rather than ascetic) lifestyle.[36] He was not to be worshipped but seen as a catalytic agent, "a sun encouraging the flower to open".[36]
Rajneesh had acquired a secretary, Laxmi Thakarsi Kuruwa, who (as his first disciple) had taken the name Ma Yoga Laxmi.[17] Laxmi was the daughter of one of his early followers, a wealthy Jain who had been a key supporter of the Congress Party during the struggle for Indian independence, and who had close ties to Gandhi, Nehru and Morarji Desai.[17] Laxmi raised the money which enabled Rajneesh to stop traveling and settle down.[17] In December 1970 he moved to the Woodlands Apartments in Mumbai, where he gave lectures and received visitors (among them his first Westerners).[33] He traveled rarely, no longer speaking at open public meetings.[33]
In 1971, he adopted the title "Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh".[35] Shree is a polite form of address, roughly equivalent to the English "sir"; Bhagwan means "Blessed One", used in Indian tradition as a term of respect for a human being in whom the divine is apparent.[37][38]
The humid Bombay weather was detrimental to Rajneesh's health; he developed diabetes, asthma and a number of allergies.[35] In 1974, on the 21st anniversary of his experience in Jabalpur, he moved to a property in Koregaon Park, Pune, which was purchased with the help of Ma Yoga Mukta (Catherine Venizelos, a Greek shipping heiress).[39][40] Rajneesh taught at the Pune ashram from 1974 to 1981. The two adjoining houses and 6 acres (2.4 ha) of land became the center of what is now the Osho International Meditation Resort. It facilitated audio and (later) video recording and printing of his discourses for worldwide distribution, enabling him to reach a larger audience. The number of Western visitors increased.[41] The ashram soon featured an arts-and-crafts centre, which produced clothes, jewellery, ceramics and organic cosmetics and hosted theatre, music and mime performances.[41] In 1975, after the arrival of therapists from the Human Potential Movement, the ashram began to complement its meditations with group therapy[42][43] (which became a major source of income).[44][45]
The Pune ashram was an intense place with a charged, carnival atmosphere.[41][46][47] The day began at 6:00 am, with Dynamic Meditation.[48][49] At 8:00 am Rajneesh gave a 60- to 90-minute lecture in the ashram's Buddha Hall auditorium, commenting on religious writings or answering questions from visitors and disciples.[41][49] Until 1981, lecture series in Hindi alternated with series in English.[50] During the day, meditation and therapy took place; their intensity was ascribed to the energy of Rajneesh's "buddhafield".[46] In evening darshans, Rajneesh conversed with individual disciples and visitors, and initiated disciples (sannyas).[41][49] Sannyasins came for darshan when leaving, returning, or when they had anything they wanted to discuss.[41]
To decide which therapies to participate in, visitors consulted Rajneesh or made selections according to their own preferences.[51] Some early therapy groups in the ashram (including an encounter group) were experimental, allowing physical aggression and sexual encounters between participants.[52][53] Conflicting reports of injuries sustained in encounter-group sessions began to appear in the press.[54][55][56]
Dick Price, a prominent Human Potential Movement therapist and co-founder of the Esalen Institute, found that the groups encouraged participants to "be violent" rather than "play at being violent" (the norm in U.S. encounter groups); he criticised them for making "the worst mistakes of some inexperienced Esalen group leaders".[57] Price is alleged to have left the Pune ashram with a broken arm, after eight hours locked in a room with participants armed with wooden weapons.[57] Bernard Gunther (Price's Esalen colleague) fared better in Pune and wrote a book, Dying for Enlightenment, with photographs and descriptions of the meditation and therapy groups.[57] Violence in the therapy groups ended in January 1979, when the ashram issued a press release saying that violence "had fulfilled its function within the overall context of the ashram as an evolving spiritual commune".[58]
Sannyasins who "graduated" from months of meditation and therapy could apply to work in the ashram, in an environment that was consciously modelled on the community led by George Gurdjieff in 1930s France.[59] Features copied from Gurdjieff were hard, unpaid work and supervisors chosen for their abrasive personalities, both designed to provoke opportunities for self-observation and transcendence.[59] Many disciples stayed for years.[59] In addition to the controversy surrounding the therapies, allegations of drug use amongst sannyasins began to mar the ashram's image;[60] some Western sannyasins financed extended stays in India with prostitution and drug-running.[61][62] Several later said that while Rajneesh was not directly involved, they discussed their plans with him in darshan and he approved.[63]
By the late 1970s the Pune ashram had become too small, and Rajneesh asked that somewhere larger be found.[64] Sannyasins throughout India began looking for properties; those found included one in the province of Kutch in Gujarat and two more in India's mountainous north.[64] The plan to move was never implemented, since mounting tensions between the ashram and the Janata Party government of Morarji Desai resulted in an impasse.[64] Land-use approval was denied, and the government stopped issuing visas to foreign visitors who indicated the ashram as their chief destination.[64][65] Desai's government also retroactively cancelled the tax-exempt status of the ashram, resulting in a tax claim estimated at $5 million.[66] Conflicts with other Indian religious leaders aggravated the situation.
By 1980 the ashram was so controversial that Indira Gandhi, despite an association between Rajneesh and the Indian Congress Party dating to the 1960s, was unwilling to intercede after her return to power.[66] In May 1980 an assassination attempt was made during one of Rajneesh's discourses by Vilas Tupe, a young Hindu fundamentalist.[64][67][68] Tupe claims that he attacked Rajneesh because he believed him to be a CIA agent.[68]
By 1981, Rajneesh's ashram hosted 30,000 visitors per year,[60] and daily discourse audiences were predominantly European and American.[69][70] Many observers noted that Rajneesh's lecture style changed during the late 1970s, becoming less focused intellectually and featuring an increasing number of ethnic or dirty jokes intended to shock (or amuse) his audience.[64] On 10 April 1981, having discoursed daily for nearly 15 years, Rajneesh entered a three-and-a-half-year period of self-imposed public silence; satsangs—silent sitting, with music and readings from spiritual works such as Khalil Gibran's The Prophet or the Isha Upanishad—replaced discourses.[71][72] Around the same time, Ma Anand Sheela (Sheela Silverman) replaced Ma Yoga Laxmi as Rajneesh's secretary.[73]
In 1981, increased tension in the Pune ashram, criticism of its activities, and threatened punitive action by Indian authorities resulted in Sheela and Rajneesh deciding to move the operation to the United States.[74][75][76] According to Susan J. Palmer, the move "appears to have been a unilateral decision on the part of Sheela."[77] Gordon notes that Sheela and Osho discussed establishing a commune in the U.S. in late 1980,[73] although he did not travel there until June 1, 1981.
Osho travelled to the United States on a tourist visa (ostensibly for medical reasons), and spent several months at a Rajneeshee retreat center at Kip's Castle in Montclair, New Jersey.[78][79] He had recently been diagnosed with a prolapsed disc and treated by several doctors, including James Cyriax (a St. Thomas' Hospital musculoskeletal physician and expert on epidural injections, who was flown in from London).[73][80][81] Osho's previous secretary, Laxmi, told Frances FitzGerald that "she had failed to find a property in India adequate to [Osho's] needs, and thus, when the medical emergency came, the initiative had passed to Sheela".[81] A public statement by Sheela indicated that Rajneesh was in grave danger if he remained in India, but would receive appropriate medical treatment in the U.S. if he required surgery.[73][80][82] Despite the allegedly serious nature of his condition, Rajneesh never sought outside medical treatment during his time in the United States, leading the Immigration and Naturalization Service to believe that he had a preconceived intention to remain there.[81] Rajneesh in 1984 pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, including making false statements on his initial visa application.[nb 1][nb 2][nb 3]
On 13 June 1981 Sheela's husband, Swami Prem Chinmaya (Marc Harris Silverman), bought the Big Muddy Ranch, a 64,229-acre (25,990 ha) ranch near Antelope, Oregon, for $5.75 million. The ranch spanned two Oregon counties: (Wasco and Jefferson).[83] The ranch was renamed "Rancho Rajneesh", and Osho moved there on 29 August.[84] Initial local reaction ranged from tolerance to hostility, varying with the resident's proximity to the ranch.[85] Within a year a series of legal battles had begun, primarily over land use.[86] In May 1982, the residents of Rancho Rajneesh voted to incorporate it as the city of Rajneeshpuram.[86] Conflict with neighbours became increasingly bitter, and over the following years, the commune was subject to pressure from a number of groups.[86][87] The commune leaders' stance was uncompromising, confrontational and impatient; their behaviour was intimidating, and repeated changes in the commune's stated plans were seen as attempts at deception.[88] In 1984, the commune imported thousands of homeless people from U.S. cities in an unsuccessful attempt to register them to vote in an upcoming county election. When this was challenged, the people were released in surrounding towns for Oregon State to return them to their home cities at state expense.[89][90]
From April 1981 to November 1984, Osho was "in silence", not speaking publicly or giving discourses. During that time, videos of his discourses were played to audiences instead.[78] His time was largely spent in seclusion; he communicated only with a few key disciples, including Ma Anand Sheela and his caretaker girlfriend Ma Yoga Vivek (Christine Woolf).[78] Osho lived in a trailer next to a covered swimming pool and other amenities. He saw most of the residents as they stood by the side of the road during his slow, daily drives.[91] Rajneesh was notorious for the many Rolls-Royces bought for his use, eventually totalling 93 vehicles;[92][93] this made him the largest single owner of Rolls-Royces in the world at that time.[94] His followers planned to expand his collection to 365: a Rolls-Royce for every day of the year.[94]
In 1981, Osho gave Sheela his limited power of attorney, removing the limits the following year.[95] In 1983, Sheela announced that he would henceforth speak only with her;[96] Osho later said that she kept him in ignorance.[95] Many sannyasins expressed doubts about whether Sheela properly represented Osho, and many dissidents left Rajneeshpuram in protest of its autocratic leadership.[97]
The many resident sannyasins without U.S. citizenship experienced visa difficulties, which some tried to overcome by marriages of convenience.[98] Commune administrators tried to resolve Osho's own immigration issues by declaring him the head of a religion, Rajneeshism.[91] In November 1981, Osho applied for resident status as a religious worker, but his application was refused on the grounds that he could not lead a religion while unwell and in silence.[91][99] This decision was later overturned due to procedural violations; permission for Osho to stay as a religious leader was granted in 1984.[91][100]
During the Oregon years, Osho emphasized his prediction that the world might be destroyed by nuclear war (or other disaster) during the 1990s.[101] He said as early as 1964 that "the third and last war is now on the way", frequently speaking about the need to create a "new humanity" to avoid global suicide.[102] This now became the basis for a new exclusivism. A 1983 article in the Rajneesh Foundation newsletter announcing that "Rajneeshism is creating a Noah's Ark of consciousness ... I say to you that except this there is no other way" increased the sense of urgency to build the Oregon commune.[102] In March 1984, Sheela announced that Rajneesh predicted the death of two-thirds of humanity from AIDS.[102][103] Sannyasins were required to wear rubber gloves and condoms if they had sex, and to refrain from kissing—measures represented in the press as an overreaction, since condoms were not commonly recommended for AIDS prevention at that time.[104][105]
During his time in Rajneeshpuram, Osho dictated three books under the influence of nitrous oxide administered by his dentist: Glimpses of a Golden Childhood, Notes of a Madman and Books I Have Loved.[106] Sheela later said that Osho took sixty milligrams of Valium each day and was addicted to nitrous oxide,[107][108][109] but he denied these allegations when questioned by journalists.[107][110]
After the Rajneeshiis' efforts to incorporate and develop the ranch as a new city were unsuccessful, the Rajneeshiis' attempted to take over the tiny city of Antelope, Oregon (2010 population 45). On September 18, 1984, Antelope's charter was amended by a vote of 57 to 22 to change the name of the city to Rajneesh.[111] In November, Rajneesh, who had originally pleaded innocent to charges of immigration fraud, changed his plea to guilty and was allowed to leave the United States under the terms of a plea bargain.[112]
On November 6, 1985, the remaining residents, both original and Rajneeshee, voted 34 to 0 to restore the original name, which was never changed by the Postal Service[111] but had been changed and was subsequently restored by the United States Board on Geographic Names.[113]
The ranch, 18 miles (29 km) from Antelope,[114] is now owned by Young Life and has been converted into a camp known as "Washington Family Ranch."[115]
Osho coached Sheela in using media coverage to her advantage; during his period of public silence, he said privately that Sheela spoke on his behalf.[116] He supported her in disputes about her behaviour with the commune leadership, but in spring 1984 (as tension amongst the inner circle peaked) a private meeting was convened with Sheela and his house staff.[116] According to testimony from Swami Devageet (Charles Harvey Newman),[117] she was admonished before the others. Osho declared that his house—not hers—was the centre of the commune.[116] He is also said to have warned that anyone close to him would be a target for Sheela.[116]
On 30 October 1984, Osho ended his period of public silence, announcing that it was time to "speak his own truths."[118][119] In July 1985 he resumed daily public discourses (against Sheela's wishes, according to statements he made to the press).[120] On 16 September 1985, two days after Sheela and her management team had left the commune for Europe, Osho held a press conference in which he described Sheela and her associates a "gang of fascists".[2] He accused them of a number of serious crimes (most dating back to 1984), and invited authorities to investigate.[2]
The alleged crimes (which Osho said were committed without his knowledge or consent) included the attempted murder of his physician, poisonings of public officials, wiretapping and bugging in the commune and his home, and a bioterror attack on citizens of The Dalles, Oregon (using salmonella) to influence county elections.[2] While his allegations were initially greeted with scepticism by outside observers,[121] subsequent investigation by U.S. authorities confirmed the accusations. Sheela and several associates pleaded guilty to charges of attempted murder and assault.[122] On 30 September 1985, Osho denied that he was a religious teacher;[123] his disciples burned 5,000 copies of the Book of Rajneeshism, a 78-page compilation of his teachings which defined Rajneeshism as "a religionless religion".[123][124] He said he ordered the book-burning to rid the sect of the last traces of Sheela's influence; her robes were also "added to the bonfire".[123]
The salmonella attack was the first confirmed instance of chemical (or biological) terrorism in the United States.[125] Osho said that because he was in silence and isolation (meeting only with Sheela), he was unaware of crimes committed by the Rajneeshpuram leadership, until Sheela and her "gang" left and sannyasins came forward to inform him.[126] A number of commentators have said that in their view, Sheela was used as a scapegoat.[126][127][128] Others have noted that although Sheela bugged Osho's living quarters and made the tapes available to U.S. authorities as part of her plea bargain, no evidence has come to light that Osho had any part in her crimes.[129][130][131] However, Gordon (1987) reports that Charles Turner, David Frohnmayer and other law enforcement officials (who saw affidavits never released publicly and listened to hundreds of hours of tape recordings) implied to him that Osho was guilty of more crimes than those for which he was prosecuted.[132] Frohnmayer asserted that Osho's philosophy was not "disapproving of poisoning", and felt that Osho and Sheela were "genuinely evil".[132]
According to court testimony by Ma Ava (Ava Avalos), a prominent disciple, Sheela played associates a tape-recording of a meeting she had with Osho about the "need to kill people" to strengthen wavering sannyasin resolve to participate in her plots:
"She came back to the meeting and ... began to play the tape. It was a little hard to hear what he was saying ... And the gist of Bhagwan's response, yes, it was going to be necessary to kill people to stay in Oregon. And that actually killing people wasn't such a bad thing. And actually Hitler was a great man, although he could not say that publicly because nobody would understand that. Hitler had great vision."[90]
Sheela initiated attempts to murder Osho's personal caretaker and girlfriend, Ma Yoga Vivek, and his physician Swami Devaraj (George Meredith) because she felt they were a threat to Osho. She had secretly recorded a conversation between Devaraj and Osho "in which the doctor agreed to obtain drugs the guru wanted to ensure a peaceful death if he decided to take his own life".[90]
Osho was indicted on 35 counts in Multnomah County, Oregon on 28 October 1985; charges included immigration violations and making false statements on his visa application. He agreed to pay $400,000 in fines, and was deported from the United States.
On 23 October 1985, a federal grand jury issued a 35-count indictment charging Osho and several other disciples with conspiracy to evade immigration laws.[133] The indictment was returned in camera, but word was leaked to Rajneesh's lawyer.[133] Negotiations to allow Osho to surrender to authorities in Portland if a warrant was issued failed.[133][134] Rumours of a National Guard takeover and the planned violent arrest of Osho led to tension and the fear of violence.[135] On the strength of Sheela's tape recordings, authorities later stated their belief that there was a plan for sannyasin women and children to form a human shield if authorities tried to arrest Osho at the commune.[132] On 28 October 1985, Rajneesh and a small number of sannyasins accompanying him were arrested aboard a rented Learjet at a North Carolina airstrip; according to federal authorities, the group was en route to Bermuda to avoid prosecution.[136] Fifty-eight thousand dollars in cash and thirty-five watches and bracelets (worth $1 million) were found on the aircraft.[135][137][138] Osho had, by all accounts, not been informed of the impending arrest or the reason for the journey.[134]
Osho's imprisonment and transfer across the country became a public spectacle. He was shown in chains and held in North Carolina, Oklahoma and Portland.[139] Officials took the full ten days legally available to transfer him from North Carolina to Portland for arraignment.[139] After initially pleading not guilty to all charges and being released on bail, on the advice of his lawyers Osho entered an Alford plea (a type of guilty plea in which a suspect does not admit guilt, but concedes there is enough evidence to convict him) to one count of concealed intent to remain permanently in the U.S. at the time of his original visa application in 1981 and one count of conspiracy to have sannyasins enter into sham marriages to acquire U.S. residency.[140]
Under the deal his lawyers made with the U.S. Attorney's office, he was given a 10-year suspended sentence, five years' probation and a $400,000 penalty in fines and prosecution costs. Osho agreed to leave the United States, not returning for at least five years without permission from the United States Attorney General.[3][122][138][141]
After leaving the U.S., Rajneesh returned to India, after numerous countries refused him entry. He landed in Delhi on 17 November 1985. He was given a hero's welcome by his Indian disciples and denounced the United States, saying the world must "put the monster America in its place" and "either America must be hushed up or America will be the end of the world".[142] He stayed for six weeks in Himachal Pradesh. When non-Indians in his party had their visas revoked, he moved on to Kathmandu, Nepal and a few weeks later to Crete. Arrested after a few days by the Greek Intelligence Service (KYP), he flew to Geneva, Stockholm and London Heathrow Airport; however, in each case he was refused entry. When Canada refused him permission to land, his plane returned to Shannon airport in Ireland to refuel. He was allowed to stay for two weeks at a hotel in Limerick, on the condition that he did not go out or give talks. Osho had been granted a Uruguayan identity card, a one-year provisional residency and the possibility of permanent residency so the party set out, stopping at Madrid (where the plane was surrounded by the Guardia Civil). He was allowed to spend one night in Dakar before continuing to Recife and Montevideo. In Uruguay the group moved into a house in Punta del Este; Osho began speaking publicly until 19 June, when he was "invited to leave" for no official reason. A two-week visa was arranged for Jamaica, but upon his arrival in Kingston the police gave his group 12 hours to leave. Refuelling in Gander and Madrid, Osho returned to Mumbai on 30 July 1986.[143][144]
On 4 January 1987 Rajneesh returned to the ashram in Pune,[145][146] where he held evening discourses daily as his health permitted.[147][148] Publishing and therapy resumed; the ashram expanded[147][148] into a "Multiversity", in which therapy was a bridge to meditation.[148] Rajneesh devised new "meditation therapy" methods (such as the "Mystic Rose"), and began to lead meditations in his discourses after more than ten years.[147][148] His Western disciples formed no large communes, preferring independent living.[149] Red and orange dress and the mala were largely abandoned (they had been optional since 1985).[148] The wearing of maroon robes in the ashram was reintroduced in summer 1989, with white robes worn for evening meditation and black robes with white sashes worn by group leaders.[148]
In November 1987, Rajneesh expressed a belief that his deteriorating health (nausea, fatigue, pain in his extremities and low resistance to infection) was due to poisoning by U.S. authorities when he was in prison.[150] His doctors and his former attorney, Philip J. Toelkes (Swami Prem Niren), hypothesised radiation and thallium poisoning (from a contaminated mattress, since his symptoms were on the right side of his body)[150] but presented no evidence.[151] U.S. attorney Charles H. Hunter described this as a "complete fiction"; others suggested the symptoms were caused by HIV infection, diabetes or chronic stress.[150][152]
From early 1988, Osho's discourses focused exclusively on Zen.[147] In late December, he said he no longer wished to be referred to as "Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh"; in February 1989 he took the name "Osho Rajneesh", which he shortened to "Osho" in September.[147][153] His health continued to weaken. He delivered his last public discourse in April 1989, from then on sitting in silence with his followers.[150] Shortly before his death, Osho suggested that one or more audience members at evening meetings (now referred to as the Osho White Robe Brotherhood) were subjecting him to a form of evil magic.[154][155] A search for the perpetrators was undertaken, but none could be found.[154][155]
Osho died at 5 p.m. on 19 January 1990 at age 58, reportedly of heart failure.[156] His ashes were placed in his newly built bedroom in Lao Tzu House at the Pune ashram. His epitaph reads "OSHO Never Born, Never Died. Only Visited this Planet Earth between Dec 11 1931 – Jan 19 1990."[citation needed]
Osho's teachings, delivered through his discourses, were not presented in an academic setting but interspersed with jokes and delivered with a rhetoric that many found spellbinding.[157][158] Their emphasis was not static, but changed over time; Osho revelled in paradox and contradiction, making his work difficult to summarise.[159] He delighted in engaging in behaviour seemingly at odds with the traditional image of an enlightened individual; his early lectures, in particular, were known for their humour and their refusal to take anything seriously.[160][161] This behaviour, capricious and difficult to accept, was explained as "a technique for transformation" to push people "beyond the mind."[160]
He spoke on major spiritual traditions (including Jainism, Hinduism, Hassidism, Tantrism, Taoism, Christianity and Buddhism), on a variety of Eastern and Western mystics and on sacred scriptures such as the Upanishads and the Guru Granth Sahib.[162] Sociologist Lewis F. Carter saw his ideas as rooted in Hindu advaita, in which the human experiences of separateness, duality and temporality are seen as a dance (or play) of cosmic consciousness in which everything is sacred, has absolute worth and is an end in itself.[163] While his contemporary, Jiddu Krishnamurti, did not approve of Osho there are clear similarities between their respective teachings.[159]
Osho also drew on a wide range of Western ideas.[162] His view of the unity of opposites recalls Heraclitus, while his description of man as a machine, condemned to the helpless acting-out of unconscious, neurotic patterns, has much in common with Freud and Gurdjieff.[159][164] Osho's vision of the "new man", transcending the constraints of convention, is reminiscent of Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil;[165] his views on sexual liberation bear comparison to D. H. Lawrence,[166] and his "dynamic" meditations owe a debt to Wilhelm Reich.[167]
According to Osho, every human being is a Buddha with the capacity for enlightenment, capable of unconditional love and of responding (rather than reacting) to life—although the ego usually prevents this, identifying with social conditioning and creating false needs and conflicts and an illusory sense of identity which is a barrier to dreams.[168][169][170] Otherwise man's innate being can flower, moving from the periphery to the centre.[168][170]
Osho viewed the mind as a mechanism for survival, replicating behavioural strategies which have proven successful in the past.[168][170] The mind's appeal to the past deprives humans of the ability to live authentically in the present, causing them to repress genuine emotions and shut themselves off from joyful experiences arising naturally when embracing the present moment: "The mind has no inherent capacity for joy ... It only thinks about joy."[170][171] The result is that people poison themselves with neuroses, jealousies and insecurities.[172] He argued that psychological repression (often advocated by religious leaders) makes suppressed feelings re-emerge in another guise, and sexual repression results in societies obsessed with sex.[172] Instead of suppressing, people should trust and accept themselves unconditionally.[170][171] This should not merely be understood intellectually, since the mind can only assimilate it as one more piece of information; meditation is also needed.[172]
Osho presented meditation not only as a practice but as a state of awareness to be maintained in every moment, a total awareness awakening the individual from the sleep of mechanical responses conditioned by beliefs and expectations.[170][172] He employed Western psychotherapy in the preparatory stages of meditation to create an awareness of mental and emotional patterns.[173]
Osho suggested a total of more than 112 meditation techniques.[173][174] His "active meditation" techniques are characterised by stages of physical activity leading to silence.[173] The best-known of these is Dynamic Meditation,[173][174] which has been described as a microcosm of his outlook.[174] Performed with closed (or blindfolded) eyes, it comprises five stages (four of which are accompanied by music).[175] First, the meditator engages in ten minutes of rapid breathing through the nose.[175] The second ten minutes are for catharsis: "Let whatever is happening happen ... Laugh, shout, scream, jump, shake—whatever you feel to do, do it!"[173][175] Next, for ten minutes one jumps up and down with arms raised, shouting "hoo" with each landing.[175][176] In the fourth (silent) stage the meditator stops moving, remaining motionless for fifteen minutes while seeing everything that is happening.[175][176] The last stage of the meditation consists of fifteen minutes of dancing and celebration.[175][176]
Osho developed other active-meditation techniques (such as the Kundalini "shaking" meditation and the Nadabrahma "humming" meditation) which are less animated, although they also include physical activity.[173] His later meditative therapies required sessions for several days; Mystic Rose comprised three hours of laughing every day for a week, three hours of weeping each day for a second week and a third week with three hours of silent meditation.[177] These processes of "witnessing" enable a "jump into awareness".[173] Osho believed such cathartic methods were necessary, since it was difficult for modern people to just sit and enter meditation. Once the methods had provided a glimpse of meditation, people would be able to use other methods without difficulty.[178]
Another key ingredient was Rajneesh's presence as a master: "A Master shares his being with you, not his philosophy ... He never does anything to the disciple."[160] The initiation he offered was another such device: "... if your being can communicate with me, it becomes a communion ... It is the highest form of communication possible: a transmission without words. Our beings merge. This is possible only if you become a disciple."[160] As an "self-parodying" guru Rajneesh deconstructed his authority, declaring his teaching to be nothing more than a "game" or a joke.[161][179] He emphasised that anything and everything could become an opportunity for meditation.[160]
Rajneesh saw his "neo-sannyas" as a new form of spiritual discipline, or one that had existed but been forgotten.[180] He felt that the traditional Hindu sannyas had turned into a system of social renunciation and imitation.[180] Rajneesh emphasised inner freedom and responsibility to oneself, demanding not superficial behavioural changes but a deeper, inner transformation.[180] Desires were to be accepted and surpassed, rather than denied.[180] Once this inner flowering had taken place, appetites such as that for sex would be left behind.[180]
Rajneesh called himself "the rich man's guru", and said that poverty was not a genuine spiritual value.[181] He said it in his way that, "I would like the whole world to live so luxuriously that people start becoming bored with luxury. And the whole earth is capable for the first time to be so luxurious that you don't feel any material need. All material needs are fulfilled. Then what you are going to do? There is nothing else than meditation.".[182] He was photographed wearing sumptuous clothing and hand-made watches[183] and, in Oregon, drove a different Rolls-Royce each day (his followers reportedly wanted to buy him 365, one for each day of the year).[94] Publicity shots of the Rolls-Royces were provided to the press;[181][184] they may have reflected his advocacy of wealth and his desire to provoke American sensibilities (as he had enjoyed offending Indian sensibilities earlier).[181][185]
Rajneesh aimed to create a "new man", combining the spirituality of Gautama Buddha with the zest for life embodied by Nikos Kazantzakis' Zorba the Greek: "He should be as accurate and objective as a scientist ... as sensitive, as full of heart, as a poet ... [and as] rooted deep down in his being as the mystic."[160][186] His term "new man" applied to men and women, whose roles he saw as complementary; indeed, most of his movement's leadership positions were held by women.[187] This new man, "Zorba the Buddha", should embrace both science and spirituality.[160] Osho believed humanity was threatened with extinction due to over-population, an impending nuclear holocaust and disease (such as AIDS), and thought many of society's ills could be remedied by scientific means.[160] The new man would no longer be trapped in institutions such as family, marriage, political ideologies and religions.[161][187] In this respect, Rajneesh is similar to other counterculture gurus and (perhaps) certain postmodern and deconstructional thinkers.[161]
During his early days as Acharya Rajneesh, a correspondent asked Rajneesh for his "ten commandments". He noted that it was a difficult matter because he was against any kind of commandment, but "just for fun" listed the following:
To become a nothingness is the door to truth. Nothingness itself is the means, the goal and attainment.
He underlined numbers 3, 7, 9 and 10;[188] these ideas have remained constant leitmotifs in his movement.[188]
Rajneesh favoured euthanasia for children with a broad variety of birth defects, such as blindness, deafness, and dumbness: "if a child is born deaf, dumb, and we cannot do anything, and the parents are willing, the child should be put to eternal sleep."[189] He maintained that people at risk of conceiving children with birth defects "don't have that permission from existence" to "take the risk of burdening the earth with a crippled, blind child".[189]
Rajneesh claimed that Jews "are guilty people, and their guilt is very great" because they crucified Jesus; out of this guilt, they are "always in search of their Adolf Hitlers, someone who can kill them". He asserted that only when Jews "reclaim Jesus", "they will be healthy and whole, and then there will be no need for Adolf Hitlers".[190]
In criticizing historical teachers of pacifism who have encouraged people to: "Just accept the situation in which you are," Rajneesh has stated that "living in poverty is far more dangerous, far more suffering than dying in a beautifully, scientifically managed gas chamber in Germany",[191] and claimed that "Hitler’s violence was far more peaceful" than (for example) the violence which erupted in India after independence from the British Crown; Hitler "killed people in the most up-to-date gas chambers, where you don’t take much time. Thousands of people can be put in a gas chamber, and just a switch is pressed ... Within a second, you evaporate. The chimneys of the factory start taking you, the smoke – you can call it holy smoke – and this seems to be a direct way towards God."[192]
During the years before his move to the United States Rajneesh supported (and encouraged) homosexual sannyasins: "No condemnation, no judgement, no evaluation. If you are a homosexual, so what?! Enjoy it! God has made you that way".[193] However, during the early to mid-1980s he arrived at a less-tolerant, more-judgemental assessment of homosexuality, and suggested that homosexuals should be isolated: "homosexuals, because they were perverted, created the disease AIDS." "They can live in their own world, in their own way, and be happy, but they should not be allowed to move in the wider society, spreading all kinds of dangerous viruses".[194] When asked by gay sannyasins to explain his new view of homosexuality, he replied "As a homosexual, you are not even a human being ... You have fallen from dignity."[195] He never changed (or retracted) these public pronouncements.
While Rajneesh's teachings were rejected in his home country during his lifetime, there has been a change in Indian public opinion since his death.[197][198] In 1991 an influential Indian newspaper counted Osho, Gautama Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi among the ten people who had most changed India's destiny; in Osho's case, by "liberating the minds of future generations from the shackles of religiosity and conformism".[199] Osho has received more acclaim in his homeland since his death than he did when he was alive.[8] In The Indian Express, columnist Tanweer Alam wrote "The late Rajneesh was a fine interpreter of social absurdities that destroyed human happiness".[200] At a 2006 celebration marking the 75th anniversary of Osho's birth, Indian singer Wasifuddin Dagar said that his teachings are "more pertinent in the current milieu than they were ever before".[201] In Nepal in January 2008 there were 60 Osho Meditation Centres, with nearly 45,000 initiated disciples.[202] Osho's works have been placed in the Library of India's National Parliament in New Delhi.[198] Prominent figures such as Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sikh writer Khushwant Singh have expressed their admiration for Osho.[203] The Bollywood actor and Osho disciple Vinod Khanna, who worked as Rajneesh's gardener in Rajneeshpuram, was India's Minister of State for External Affairs from 2003 to 2004.[204] Over 650 books are credited to Osho,[205] expressing his views on all facets of human existence;[206] virtually all are transcriptions of his taped discourses.[206] His books are available in 55 languages,[207] and have entered bestseller lists in Italy and South Korea.[199]
After nearly two decades of controversy and a decade of accommodation, Osho's movement has established itself in the market of new religions.[208] His followers have redefined his contributions, reframing central elements of his teaching to make them less controversial to outsiders.[208] Societies in North America and Western Europe have become more accommodating of spiritual topics such as yoga and meditation.[208] The Osho International Foundation (OIF) runs stress management seminars for corporate clients such as IBM and BMW, with a revenue reported in 2000 between $15 million and $45 million annually in the U.S.[209][210]
Osho's ashram in Pune has become the Osho International Meditation Resort, one of India's main tourist attractions.[211] Describing itself as the Esalen of the East, it teaches a variety of spiritual techniques from a broad range of traditions and promotes itself as a spiritual oasis, a "sacred space" for discovering oneself and uniting the desires of body and mind in a resort environment.[9] According to press reports, it attracts about 200,000 people from around the world each year;[196][203] visitors have included politicians, media personalities and the Dalai Lama.[211] Before entering the resort, an HIV test is required; HIV-positive visitors are not allowed in.[212] In 2011, a national seminar on Osho's teachings was inaugurated at the Department of Philosophy of the Mankunwarbai College for Women in Jabalpur.[213] Funded by the Bhopal office of the University Grants Commission, the seminar focused on Osho's "Zorba the Buddha" teaching and sought to reconcile spirituality with a materialist, objective approach.[213]
Osho is generally considered one of the most controversial spiritual leaders to have emerged from India during the 20th century.[214][215] His message of sexual, emotional, spiritual and institutional liberation and the pleasure he derived in causing offence ensured that his life was surrounded by controversy.[187] Osho was known as the "sex guru" in India and the "Rolls-Royce guru" in the United States.[181] He attacked the concept of nationalism, was contemptuous of politicians and poked fun at the leading figures of a number of religions (who, in turn, disliked his arrogance).[216][217] Osho's ideas on sex, marriage, family and relationships contradicted traditional views, arousing anger and opposition around the world.[79][218] His movement was feared and despised as a cult; he lived "in ostentation and offensive opulence", while his followers (most of whom had severed ties with outside friends and family and donated all—or most—of their money and possessions to the commune) might live at a "subsistence level".[89][219]
Describing how the body of Rajneesh's work might be summarised, sociologist Bob Mullan from the University of East Anglia said in 1983: "It certainly is eclectic, a borrowing of truths, half-truths and occasional misrepresentations from the great traditions. It is also often bland, inaccurate, spurious and extremely contradictory".[220] While acknowledging that Rajneesh's range and imagination were second to none[220] and many of his statements were insightful and moving (perhaps even profound at times),[221] what remained was "a potpourri of counter-culturalist and post-counter-culturalist ideas" focusing on love and freedom, the need to live for the moment, the importance of self, the feeling of "being okay", the mysteriousness of life, the fun ethic, the individual's responsibility for their own destiny and the need to lose the ego, fear and guilt.[222]
Uday Mehta, appraising Osho's teachings (particularly errors in his interpretation of Zen, Mahayana Buddhism and how they relate to the proto-materialist nature of Tantric philosophy), suggests "It is not surprising to find that Rajneesh could get away with several gross contradictions and inconsistencies in his teachings. This was possible for the simple reason that an average Indian (or for that matter even western) listener knows so little about religious scriptures or various schools of thought that it hardly requires much effort to exploit his ignorance and gullibility".[223] According to Mehta, Osho's appeal to his Western disciples was based on his social experiments (which established a philosophical connection between the Eastern guru tradition and the Western growth movement).[214]
In 1996 Hugh B. Urban (Assistant Professor of Religion and Comparative Studies at Ohio State University), like Mullan, found Osho's teaching neither original nor especially profound and noted that most of its content had been drawn from a number of Eastern and Western philosophies.[161] What he found most original about Osho was his keen instinct for marketing strategy, in which he adapted his teachings to meet the changing desires of his audience[161] (a theme also raised by Gita Mehta in her book, Karma Cola: Marketing the Mystic East).[224] In 2005 Urban observed that Osho underwent a "remarkable apotheosis" after his return to India (especially since his death), describing him as illustrating what F. Max Müller over a century ago called "that world-wide circle through which, like an electric current, Oriental thought could run to the West and Western thought return to the East".[225] By negating the dichotomy between spiritual and material desires and reflecting the preoccupation with sexuality and the body characteristic of late capitalist consumer culture, Osho created a spiritual path in tune with the socio-economic conditions of his time.[225]
In his 1999 Exploring New Religions, George Chryssides described Osho as primarily a Buddhist teacher who promoted an independent "Beat Zen".[215] He called descriptions of Osho's teachings as a "potpourri" of various religious teachings unfortunate, because Osho was "no amateur philosopher"; drawing attention to Osho's academic background, he said: "Whether or not one accepts his teachings, he was no charlatan when it came to expounding the ideas of others".[215] Chryssides viewed the unsystematic, contradictory and outrageous aspects of Osho's teachings as part of the nature of Zen, reflecting the fact that spiritual teaching seeks to induce a different kind of change in an audience than do philosophic lectures (which aim to improve intellectual understanding).[215]
Peter B. Clarke, in the Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements (2006), noted that Osho has come to be "seen as an important teacher within India itself" and is "increasingly recognised as a major spiritual teacher of the twentieth century, at the forefront of the current 'world-accepting' trend of spirituality based on self-development".[226] Clarke said that the style of therapy Osho devised, with its liberal attitude towards sexuality as a sacred part of life, influenced other therapy practitioners and New Age groups.[226] In his view, the main motivation of seekers joining the movement was "neither therapy nor sex, but the prospect of becoming enlightened, in the classical Buddhist sense".[59] While few achieved their aim, most current and former members felt they had made progress in self-actualisation (as defined by American psychologist Abraham Maslow) and the human-potential movement.[59]
A number of commentators have noted Osho's charisma. Comparing him with Gurdjieff, Anthony Storr wrote that Osho was "personally extremely impressive" and that "many of those who visited him for the first time felt that their most intimate feelings were instantly understood, that they were accepted and unequivocally welcomed rather than judged. [Osho] seemed to radiate energy and to awaken hidden possibilities in those who came into contact with him".[227] Many sannyasins have stated that upon hearing Osho speak, they "fell in love with him".[228][229] Susan J. Palmer noted that even his critics attested to the power of his presence.[228] Psychiatrist and researcher James S. Gordon recalls inexplicably finding himself laughing like a child, hugging strangers and having tears of gratitude in his eyes after a glance from Osho in his passing Rolls-Royce.[230] Frances FitzGerald concluded after listening to Osho in person that he was a brilliant lecturer; she was surprised by his comedic talent (not apparent in his books) and the hypnotic quality of his talks, which had a profound effect on his audience.[231] Hugh Milne (Swami Shivamurti), an ex-devotee who between 1973 and 1982 worked closely with Rajneesh as leader of his Pune Ashram Guard[232] and his personal bodyguard,[233][234] noted that their first meeting left him with a sense that more than words had passed between them: "There is no invasion of privacy, no alarm, but it is as if his soul is slowly slipping inside mine, and in a split second transferring vital information."[235] Milne also observed another facet of Osho's charismatic ability: he was "a brilliant manipulator of the unquestioning disciple".[236]
Hugh B. Urban noted that Osho appeared to fit Max Weber’s classic image of the charismatic figure, seen to possess "an extraordinary supernatural power or 'grace', which was essentially irrational and affective".[237] Osho corresponded to Weber's charismatic type in rejecting rational laws and institutions and claiming to subvert all hierarchical authority, although Urban notes that this promise of absolute freedom actually resulted in bureaucratic organisation and institutional control in larger communes.[237]
Scholars have suggested that Osho, like other charismatic leaders, may have had a narcissistic personality.[238][239][240] In his paper The Narcissistic Guru: A Profile of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, Ronald O. Clarke (Emeritus Professor of Religious Studies at Oregon State University) argued that Osho exhibited all the typical features of narcissistic personality disorder: a grandiose sense of self-importance and uniqueness, preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, the need for constant attention and admiration, a set of characteristic responses to threats to self-esteem, disturbances in interpersonal relationships, preoccupation with personal grooming, frequent prevarication (or outright lying) and a lack of empathy.[240] Drawing on Osho's childhood memories in Glimpses of a Golden Childhood, he suggested that Osho experienced a lack of parental discipline due to his upbringing by overindulgent grandparents.[240] Osho's self-proclaimed Buddha status, he concluded, was part of a delusional system associated with his narcissistic personality disorder (ego-inflation rather than egolessness).[240]
There are differing views of Osho's qualities as a thinker and speaker. Khushwant Singh, author, historian and former editor of the Hindustan Times, has described him as "the most original thinker that India has produced: the most erudite, the most clearheaded and the most innovative".[241] He saw Osho as a "free-thinking agnostic" who could explain abstract concepts in simple language (illustrated with witty anecdotes), who mocked gods, prophets, scriptures and religious practices and who gave a new dimension to religion.[242] The German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk, who became a disciple of Rajneesh during the late 1970s, has called him a "Wittgenstein of religions" and ranks him one of the greatest figures of the 20th century; in his view, Osho had performed a radical deconstruction of the word games played by the world's religions.[243]
During the early 1980s, a number of commentators in the popular press were dismissive of Rajneesh.[244] Australian critic Clive James called him "Bagwash", comparing listening to one of his discourses to sitting in a laundrette and watching "your tattered underwear revolve soggily for hours while exuding grey suds. The Bagwash talks the way that looks".[244][245] James concluded by saying that Rajneesh, although a "fairly benign example of his type," was a "rebarbative dingbat who manipulates the manipulable into manipulating one another".[244][245][246] Responding to an enthusiastic review of one of Osho's talks by Bernard Levin in The Times, Dominik Wujastyk (also in The Times) expressed his opinion that the talk he heard when visiting the Pune ashram was of a very low standard, wearyingly repetitive and often factually wrong; he was disturbed by the personality cult surrounding Osho.[244][247]
In the Seattle Post-Intelligencer in January 1990, American author Tom Robbins wrote that Osho's books convinced him that Osho was the 20th century's "greatest spiritual teacher". Robbins (stressing that he was not a disciple) continued that he had "read enough vicious propaganda and slanted reports to suspect that he was one of the most maligned figures in history."[241] Osho's commentary on Guru Nanak's song "Japji Sahib" was hailed as the best available by former president of India Giani Zail Singh.[198] In 2011, author Farrukh Dhondy called Osho "the cleverest intellectual confidence trickster that India has produced. His output of the 'interpretation' of Indian texts is specifically slanted towards a generation of disillusioned westerners who wanted (and perhaps still want) to 'have their cake, eat it' [and] claim at the same time that cake-eating is the highest virtue according to ancient-fused-with-scientific wisdom".[248]

=======================================================
Osho is born in Kuchwada, a small village in the state of Madhya Pradesh, central India, where His maternal grandparents live. 
Following the death of his paternal grandmother, the care of her youngest children and of the family business falls to Osho's young parents. Osho goes to live with his maternal grandparents, who proved for him an extraordinary atmosphere of freedom and respect. 
According to his own accounts, and the accounts of others, who knew him during his childhood, he was a daredevil and mischief-maker, never missing an opportunity to test his own physical limits and to challenge self-importance or hypocrisy wherever he found it. He was a rebellious and independent spirit, insisting on experiencing the truth rather than acquiring knowledge and beliefs given by others. 
After the death of his maternal grandfather, Osho and his grandmother both move to Gadarwada, the town where his parents live. There he is enrolled in school for the first time. Here he was creating mischief and challenging his teachers, Osho continues the adventurous and often solitary approach to life that characterized his first years with his grandparents. 
In 1945, at the age of fourteen, he undertakes a seven-day experiment, waiting for death, provoked in part by an unusual prediction by an astrologer who was commissioned to calculate his birth chart. (My mother's father used to tell me that when I was born he consulted one of the best known astrologers of those days. The astrologer was to make my birth chart, but he studied it and he said, "If this child survives after seven years, only then will I make the chart. It seems impossible that he can survive for more than seven years, so if the child is going to die it is useless to make the chart; it will be of no use. It is almost certain that this child is going to die at the age of twenty-one. Every seven year he will have to face death." - Osho
So my parents, my family, were always worried about my death. Whenever I would come to the end of a seven-year cycle, they would become afraid. And he was right. At the age seven I survived, but I had a deep experience of death - not of my own, but of the death of my maternal grandfather. And I was so much attached to him that his death appeared to be my own death. 
...When I reached the age of fourteen, my family again became disturbed that I would die. I survived, but then I again tried it consciously. I said to them, "If death is going to occur as the astrologer has said, then it is better to be prepared. And why give a chance to death? Why should I not go and meet it halfway? If I am going to die, then it is better to die consciously. - Osho" ... I went to a temple just outside of my village. I arranged with the priest that he should not disturb me. It was a very lonely, unvisited temple - old, in ruins. 	 	 
No one ever came to it. So I told him, "I will remain in the temple. You just give me something to eat and something to drink once a day, and the whole day I will be lying there waiting for death." 
 "For seven days I waited. Those seven days became a beautiful experience. Death never came, But on my part I tried in every way to be dead. Strange, weird feelings happened. Many things happened, but the basic note was this-- that if you are feeling you are going to die, you become calm and silent. Nothing creates any worry then, because all worries are concerned with life. 
Life is the basis of all worries. When you are going to die anyway one day, why worry? Then again at age of twenty-one, my family was waiting. So I told them, "Why do you go on waiting? Do not wait. Now I am not going to die." Physically, someday I will die, of course. However, this prediction of the astrologer helped me very much because he made me aware very early about death. I could meditate and could accept that it was coming. 
After His enlightenment at the twenty one, Osho completed His academic studies and spent several years teaching philosophy at the University of Jabalpur. Meanwhile, He traveled throughout India giving talks, challenging orthodox religious leaders in public debate, questioning traditional beliefs, and meeting people from all walks of life. He read extensively, everything He could find to broaden His understanding of the belief systems and psychology of contemporary man.
Osho majors in philosophy and wins numerous awards in debating competitions. He graduates with honors from D.N. Jain College and invited by Professor S. S. Roy to do his postgraduate study at Sagar University.
Osho accepts a position first at Sanskrit College in Raipur and later at the University of Jabalpur, where he teaches philosophy. His unorthodox and challenging approach to teaching draws many students to his classes, regardless of whether they have actually enrolled for credit. As the years pass he begins to spend more and more time away from his teaching duties and begins traveling to public speaking engagements throghout India. 
During his travels and speaking engagements, Osho often conducts guided meditations at end of his talks. The first meditation centers to emerge around his teaching are known as Jivan Jagruti Kendras (Life Awakening Centers), and his movement is called Jivan Jagruti Andolan (Life Awakening Movement). 
In addition to his speaking engagements, Osho begins to hold 3 to 10 days "meditation camps" in the countryside, where he gives daily talks and personally guides the participants in meditation.
Ranakpur Meditation Camp became a landmark in Osho's work because for the first time his discourses and meditations were recorded and published in a book, "Path to Self-Realization", which was widely acclaimed in India. Osho later said that this book contains his whole teaching, which has never altered. 
A quarterly magazine in Hindi is published by Jivan Jagruti Kendra of Bombay, which also becomes the official publisher of books transcribed from Osho's talks.

Osho was a well-known spiritual leader. In this biography, we have given information about the childhood, life and timeline of Rajneesh Osho.
place of death: Pune, Maharashtra, India epitaphs: "Never born, Never died: only visited this planet earth between December 11, 1931 and, January 19, 1990."  father: Babulal mother: Saraswati Jain education: University of Sagar (1957), D. N. Jain College (1955), Hitkarini Dental College & Hospital
Works & Achievements: Osho, a controversial spiritual leader, was responsible for introducing the 'Dynamic Meditation' method to his disciples. He was a public speaker, who talked about spirituality in a different and controversial way. The founder of Osho International Meditation Center, based in Pune, he formulated a number of meditation techniques. He was also responsible for setting up Rajneeshpuram in the US after he moved there in 1981.
Osho was one of the most famed as well as the most controversial spiritual leaders of his time. He came to be known as 'Acharya Rajneesh' in 1960s, assumed the name 'Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh' during the 1970s and 1980s and called himself 'Osho' in 1989.  He was a professor of Philosophy and traveled extensively to various parts of India, giving lectures on Secularism and Gandhi. He institutionalized religion and advocated an open attitude towards sexuality, which landed him in a number of controversies. Founder of Osho International Meditation Center, he devised a number of meditation techniques and came to be known as a spiritual therapist.
Osho was born on December 11, 1931, in Kuchwada, a small village in Madhya Pradesh, India. He was born into the Taranpanthi Jain community. Originally named Rajneesh Chandra Mohan, he was the eldest of eleven children in a family of Jain cloth merchants. At the age of seven, he was sent to live with his maternal grandparents. At his grandmother’s home, Rajneesh was nurtured with full independence, without the hassle of imposed education or other restrictions. 
Rajneesh grew up as a very rebellious child. After the death of his grandmother, he returned to stay with his parents. By the time he reached adolescence, Rajneesh had inculcated interest in hypnosis and become an atheist. For a short period, he was associated with Socialism as well as two Indian independence movements - the Indian National Army and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
After completing his studies at a high school in Gadarwara, Rajneesh went to Jabalpur. In 1951, at the age of nineteen, he joined Hitkarini College in Jabalpur. There, he had a conflict with a lecturer, as a result of which, he was transferred to D.N. Jain College. Rajneesh was spiritually enlightened on March 21, 1953. Following the enlightenment, he went on to finish his studies. He earned his Bachelor’s of Arts Degree from Jabalpur University, in 1955, and received Master’s Degree in Philosophy from Sagar University, in 1957. Meanwhile, he took part in the annual Sarva Dharma Sammelan held at Jabalpur, organized by the Taranpanthi Jain community, where he initiated his first public speaking. He continued to participate in public speaking from 1951 to 1968. 
In 1957, Rajneesh became a lecturer at Sanskrit College in Raipur. His unconventional ideas about life soon fetched him a transfer, as the Vice Chancellor considered him a serious danger to the morality and character of the students. The following year, he acquired the position of a professor at Jabalpur University, where he taught Philosophy. In the meantime, he traveled extensively across India, giving lectures on Socialism and Gandhi, under the name of ‘Acharya Rajneesh’.
Acharya Rajneesh criticized orthodox Indian religions. His bold statements made him a controversial personality. Some people were in his favor, while others went against him. A number of wealthy merchants and businessmen, who were in favor of his ideology, consulted him frequently to seek guidance about their spiritual development and daily life. It was clearly visible from the rapid growth of this practice that he possessed an unusual talent as a spiritual therapist.  
Acharya Rajneesh moved from Jabalpur to Mumbai in 1970. The same year, he introduced his ‘Dynamic Meditation’ method for the first time, in Mumbai, at a public meditation event. On September 26, 1970, he organized an outdoor meditation camp, which comprises of a large gathering of his followers. After a couple of months, he shifted to Woodlands Apartments in Mumbai, where he received visitors and gave lectures. By this time, he had started traveling less frequently and discontinued speaking at open public meetings. He adopted the title ‘Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh’ in 1971.
The climatic conditions in Mumbai proved to be unfavorable for Osho, as a result of which, he developed several health problems. Consequently, he left Mumbai for Pune in 1974. His disciples set up an ashram in Pune, where he taught from 1974 to 1981. Initially, the audio recordings of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh's discourses were regularly played in the ashram, followed by video recording and printing of the material for worldwide distribution. Over a period of time, the number of Western visitors increased drastically, leading to constant expansion of the ashram. It soon featured an arts-and-crafts centre and included music and theatrical performances. The ashram in Pune is known as 'Osho International Meditation Center' in the present times.  
After giving discourses on a daily basis for almost 15 years, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh underwent a three-and-a-half years of self-imposed public silence in 1981. His discourses were then substituted by satsangs and readings from spiritual works. This phase continued until 1984. Thereafter, he resumed his presentations, but in a limited way. 
Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh traveled to the United States on June 1 1981, to get treatment for prolapsed disc. In Wasco County, Oregon he purchased a ranch, then known as the Big Muddy Ranch, and named it ‘Rajneeshpuram’. The ranch measured a massive 64,229-acre and was bought for approximately $ 5.75 million. The money was paid by his secretary, Ma Anand Sheela’s husband, Swami Prem Chinmaya (Marc Harris Silverman). In a matter of a few years the number of followers, staying at the ranch, grew astronomically and the ranch became a community in itself. This community was given the name of Rajneeshpuram and its residents, Osho’s followers, were called Rajneeshees. The construction of Rajneeshpuram proved to be a controversial issue because it resulted in arguments over zoning rules and building codes between his followers and the residents of Wasco County and eventually, with the rest of the State. There was a clash of cultures and the inhabitants felt threatened by the influx of his devotees. As a result, building permits were denied. The conflict soon centered on Antelope, Oregon, since it was the city closest to Rajneeshpuram. More and more deciples of Osho were beginning to settle down in Antelope and got themselves elected straightaway to the town council. Meanwhile, there were allegations that the followers of Osho were involved in illegal activities, like spreading salmonella at a local restaurant; allegations of murder were also made against them.
During this entire upheaval and the conflicts caused by it, Osho Rajneesh withdrew from public speaking and limited his interaction to a handful of followers; Ma Anand Sheela being one of them. He only saw his followers when he would drive by them every day in his Rolls Royce.
The Rolls Royce was also a reason for him gathering more fame. This happening because at its height, the number of Rolls Royce’s bought for his use had reached an absolutely astounding 93 cars. This also gave him the exclusivity of being the only person to have had so many Rolls Royce’s. During his silence, he had provided Sheela with a power of attorney with which she could ‘act on his behalf’, however in 1984, he had a falling out with her and accused her of having committed crimes like attempting to influence elections with bioterror attacks on Dalles, Oregon, attempting to murder his physician, tapping his house and the commune and even attempting to poison a public official, which he invited the authorities to investigate.
IIn 1985, a federal grand jury indicted Osho on 35 charges, among which  were charges against him regarding him having concealed intentions about  settling in the US and charges of having his deciples enter into  marriages of convenience to get US citizenship. He plead guilty to the  some of the charges and was awarded a suspended sentence, a penalty of  about US $ 400,000 and asked to leave the country and not return for a  minimum of 5 years.
Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh reluctantly decided to leave for India, after the episode in the United States. It was at this time that he decided to change his name from to Osho. After staying in Himachal Pradesh for six weeks, he traveled to Kathmandu, Nepal and then moved to Crete in Greece. After being refused by a number of countries, Osho returned to India in 1986. In January 1987, Osho moved back to his old ashram in Pune, where he resumed his discoursing. This was followed by the continuation of therapy courses. Osho formulated several meditation techniques during this time. The ashram was renewed and expanded, this time in a less controversial style. 
Osho breathed his last in the year 1990. It was stated that heart failure was the cause of his death. His physicians hypothesized that he had been poisoned by radiation and thallium in the United States and that he must have slept on his right side on a deliberately irradiated mattress, as his symptoms were concentrated on the right side of his body. However, his followers had no evidence to support the hypothesis.

 1984:  Ended his withdrawal from lectures, which was also called a period of silence which had been started by him in disapproval of the unpleasantness that his growing fame was causing with the local communities around his ashram.
 1985:  Osho returned to India on 17th November  1895. Six weeks after returning he left India and went to Kathmandu since the visa for some of his non – Indian followers had been revoked.
 1986:  After months of traveling around and being denied entry to various countries, he finally came back to India on 30 July 1986.

Osho or Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh was born in 1931 in Central  India. He was a charismatic and gifted speaker who became the leader of a  worldwide new spiritual movement. It is said that at the age of 21 he attained  enlightenment or Samadhi. At the time he was studying philosophy at the  University of Saugar. On receiving a masters degree he taught philosophy at the  University of Jabalpur for nine years. 
As well as teaching philosophy he also began to attract  disciples to follow his own eclectic mix of philosophy and religion. In 1966 he  decided to leave his teaching post and give full attention to his role as  spiritual Master. In 1974 he moved with his disciples to Pune, India. Here he  established a new ashram in a comfortable setting of 6 acres. In 1980 he was  attacked by a Hindu fundamentalist who disagreed with Osho’s unconventional  stance on religion and spirituality. It is said that due to police incompetence  the assailant was never convicted. 
Due to failing health Osho decided to leave India for  America where he would be able to receive better medical treatment. His  disciples bought a large plot of land near Antelope, Oregon. Here they wished  to build a large ashram and other buildings. There was often friction between  the local townspeople and the ashramites. There was a clash of cultures and the  local townspeople felt threatened by the influx of devotees. Because of this  many building permits were denied. This led to ashramites trying to get elected  directly to the town council. There were also allegations made that followers  of Osho were involved in illegal activities such as spreading salmonella in a  local restaurant. More seriously there were allegations of Murder made against  some followers of Osho. Two were eventually convicted of the murder of Charles  Turner who had tried to close the ranch.
In 1987 Osho became fearful of investigation by the  authorities so he decided to leave the compound in Oregon and went to South  Carolina. Here he fell foul of US immigration law. He had arranged false  marriages and other violations of immigration laws. He was given a suspended  sentence on the condition that he leave the country. Therefore he reluctantly  decided to leave for Puna in India. It was at this time that he decided to  change his name from Rajneesh to Osho. This is said to be a Japanese word for  “Master”, although others say Osho comes from the term “oceanic experience”  Osho died in 1990, his birth certificate gave a reason of heart failure.  Although some followers alleged poisoning by the CBI, although these  allegations had little evidence to support them.
Osho was born into a Jain family. He though never believed  in any one religion but combined elements of many religions such as Buddhism,  Hinduism and Christianity. However he also added new types of meditation  practise. His philosophy was a type of Monism that God was in everything. All  human beings were in essence divine, it was just that there were different  manifestations of that divinity. He introduced a new type of meditation that  involved letting go of all attachments to the past and future and ego. 
            If a seeker could attain a consciousness where there was  "no past, no future, no attachment, no mind, no ego, no self.” Then he  would attain enlightenment. One different practise he advocated was to practise  physical exercise just before meditation. Unlike many Indian gurus Osho taught  that sex was not an obstacle to spiritual progress. Although many of his  disciples led fairly simple and frugal lifestyles Osho was well known for his  love of cars. It is said he amassed over 20 Rolls Royces. 
It is estimated over 50,000 Westerners spent time seeking  enlightenment with the Guru. At its peak there were over 200,000 members world  wide, although this dropped off after the scandals of the late 1980s. Osho  never wised to appoint a successor but he did appoint 21 followers to  administer the Osho foundation which continues to provide an outlet for the  dissemination of his teaching.
