From Chapter One – “I grew up in a world of violence and unpredictability. I learned to protect myself the best I could. I learned to take care of myself because no one else would. I learned to lie, to conceal, and to cover my fear with anger and violence.
No one knew the abuse that went on in our home, as we all learned to keep it hidden. No one knew my wish to make it stop. And later, no one knew the fear that overwhelmed me and drove me to hit and hurt the ones I loved most.”
This book exposes the thinking, beliefs and actions of a child who grows up to find himself being the abuser in his family. We follow his story from before childhood to the beginning of his journey to stop his violent and abusive behaviors.
Lee Cox offers powerful insights into his journey of healing himself. When he shares his story, his courage, candor and honesty inspire his audience to help stop domestic abuse. Lee speaks to: Students, Teachers, Law Enforcement, Domestic Violence Professionals, Civic organizations, Self Help groups and Community Leaders.

James Russell Mercer (born December 26, 1970) is an American guitarist and musician. He is the founder, vocalist, lead singer-songwriter and sole remaining original member of the indie rock group The Shins. In 2009, Mercer and producer Danger Mouse formed the side project Broken Bells, for which they released a self-titled album in March 2010, followed by After the Disco in 2014. Mercer has also acted, appearing in Matt McCormick's feature film Some Days Are Better Than Others, which premiered in 2010.
Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Mercer attended high school in both England and Germany; he lived in England from 1985 to 1990, as his family moved there because his father was in the United States Air Force.[1]
In the early 1990s, Mercer belonged to a group called Blues Roof Dinner. In 1992, Mercer founded the band Flake Music (originally called Flake) with drummer Jesse Sandoval, keyboardist Marty Crandall, and bassist Neal Langford.[2] Together, they produced the well-received album When You Land Here, It's Time to Return, and toured with Modest Mouse and Califone.[2]
Shortly after the release of When You Land Here, in 1999, Mercer formed The Shins in Albuquerque, New Mexico as a side project.[2][3] Mercer named the band The Shins after the family in the musical The Music Man, a favorite of Mercer's father.[4] The project began as a way to explore three-minute pop songs with conventional chord structure.[5] Mercer recruited Jesse Sandoval to play drums and the two began performing as a duo. The Shins played with Cibo Matto and the American Analog Set, with Mercer serving as the primary songwriter for the band.[2] As The Shins rose to popularity, Flake Music eventually disbanded in 1999, leaving Mercer, Sandoval, and Langford, who joined after Flake Music's disbanding, to focus completely on The Shins.[2] In 2002, the band relocated to Portland, Oregon.
In 2007, Mercer sang backup vocals on the tracks "Florida," "Missed the Boat," and "We've Got Everything" on Modest Mouse's album We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank. Mercer has also been credited with playing several instruments on The Shins' albums, including guitar, bass, synthesizer, ukulele, banjo, harmonium, percussion, beat and MIDI programming.
Mercer began collaborating with Danger Mouse in 2005 when he performed in the song "Insane Lullaby" featured on the Danger Mouse/Sparklehorse album, Dark Night of the Soul, which, however, was not officially released until July 2010. After working together on the album, in September 2009, Mercer and Danger Mouse announced a new project called Broken Bells,[6] and, on March 9, 2010, released their debut self-titled album, Broken Bells. They have also released a second album together on February 4, 2014 called After the Disco.
In 2010, Mercer acted in Matt McCormick's feature film Some Days Are Better Than Others, playing the role of Eli, a directionless slacker. The film premiered at the 2010 SXSW Film and Music Festival.[7] Also, in 2010, Mercer and Modest Mouse frontman Isaac Brock contributed original music to director Chris Malloy's 180° South, a documentary about adventurers in Patagonia.[8] Of the two songs that Mercer contributed, one was a cover of Neil Young's "Journey Through the Past."[8]
Musical influences he has mentioned include The Smiths, The Cure, Echo & the Bunnymen, The Beach Boys, The Beatles, The Zombies and The Jesus and Mary Chain and Désulvo.[1]
Mercer married designer and home decorator Marisa Kula in April 2006 in a small ceremony on Waimanalo Beach in Hawaii, where Kula was born and raised.[9][10] They had met when Kula, then a journalist, was assigned to interview Mercer for a story.[10] They have two daughters together.[9]

Broken Bells is an American indie rock band composed of artist-producer Brian Burton (better known as Danger Mouse) and James Mercer, the lead vocalist and guitarist for the indie rock band The Shins. Broken Bells compose and create as a duo, but are joined by a full band on tour. The live band included Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band sidemen Nate Walcott and Nik Freitas, and Jonathan Hischke and Dan Elkan, both ex-members of Hella.[1] Following their 2010 self-titled debut album, the duo released an EP, Meyrin Fields, in 2011 and their second studio album, After the Disco, on February 4, 2014.
Brian Burton and James Mercer decided to work together after meeting at the Roskilde Festival in 2004 and finding they were fans of each other's work.[2] It took four more years before the two started working together and by March 2008 Mercer and Burton began recording together in secret at Burton's Los Angeles-based studio.[3] The project was first announced on September 29, 2009.[4] The two described their material as "melodic, but experimental, too."[5]
Prior to the formation of Broken Bells, Mercer and Burton both worked together on the track "Insane Lullaby" on the album Dark Night of the Soul by Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse. Broken Bells have since performed the song several times, often as a tribute to the late Mark Linkous, the Sparklehorse frontman who died in early 2010.
Broken Bells self-titled debut album was released in the United States and Canada on March 9, 2010 through Columbia Records,[6] and has sold over 400,000 copies domestically, peaking at number 7 on the Billboard 200 chart. The album has received positive reviews.[7] Rolling Stone magazine gave it a four-star review and stated that it was "the year’s coolest left field pop disc."[8] Besides their album being among the year’s highest charting debut albums, the band had sold out shows on their first ever tour.
On February 14, 2012, in an interview with KINK.FM (a Portland radio station), James Mercer stated that he was currently working on Broken Bells' second album.[10] On October 8, 2013, the band announced the release of its second album, After the Disco. Broken Bells released their lead single from the album, titled "Holding on for Life", on November 4, 2013.[11] After the Disco was released on February 4, 2014. That same day they covered "And I Love Her" alongside footage of Ringo Starr on an old television as part of the "Late Show With David Letterman" "Beatles Week" to celebrates the 50th anniversary of the band's debut appearance on "Ed Sullivan".[12] The band performed "Holding on for Life" on the March 7, 2014 episode of "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.".[13]

James Mercer (February 26, 1736 – October 31, 1793), also known as William James Mercer, was an American soldier, jurist and political figure.
Mercer was born in Virginia at Malborough plantation on February 26, 1736. He was the son of John Mercer and Catherine Mason Mercer. He graduated from the College of William and Mary about 1755. After graduation, he went to serve as a captain in the French and Indian War and became the commander of Fort Loudoun in Winchester, Virginia, in 1756.
Mercer subsequently entered politics and became a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1765. He later served as a delegate for Virginia to the Continental Congress in 1779.
He was appointed a judge of the general court in 1780 and became a judge on the first Court of Appeals as a result. In 1789, he was appointed as a member of the reorganized Court of Appeals. He remained on the bench of that court until his death in Richmond on October 31, 1793.
Mercer was the brother of George Mercer and John Francis Mercer, and father of Charles Fenton Mercer.

James Mercer had to destroy the Shins so the Shins could live — just part of a newfound cathartic, if personally thorny, just-say-yes policy that led to a creative rebirth. "I don't know too many people who were inhibited like I was," he says. "Life is so short. But you don't realize it at 20."
"For the longest time, I didn't even want to admit I was serious about music," says James Mercer, sitting cross-legged on the floor of his home studio in Portland, Oregon, fiddling with one of the pedal and effects cords snarled around him. "Before the Shins, I would tell myself, 'Oh, I'm going to figure something out someday. I had this romantic vision of being this old dude maybe making guitars or something." Instead, over the course of the past decade, he formed a touring band to help interpret his jangly, cryptic pop-rock ruminations. And over the course of three increasingly rich, and increasingly absorbing, Shins albums (aided, yes, by an unlikely, much-deliberated goose from Natalie Portman), Mercer settled into permanent rotation on the iPods of seemingly every thirtysomething in America who happened to remotely resemble James Mercer.
In a few weeks, the 41-year-old musician will release Port of Morrow, the first new Shins record in five years, and the first since Mercer parted ways with his longtime bandmates in a move that many called a firing and he terms "an aesthetic decision." It's a brighter, poppier beast than previous ventures, filled with spacey '70s keyboards and surprisingly straightforward lyrics. The soft-spoken military brat, who has lived every-where from England to Albuquerque, says Morrow may be an outgrowth of his collaborations with other musicians, including Broken Bells partner Brian Burton, a.k.a. Danger Mouse, and Port contributors Janet Weiss (Wild Flag) and Los Angeles–based producer Greg Kurstin (Lily Allen, Ke$ha). 
Later today, he'll be shooting a video for "Simple Song," the first single off the new album, but right now he is tucked away in the turn-of-the-century carriage house he's converted into a studio for his new label, Aural Apothecary, just behind the big Victorian house he shares with his wife, Marisa, and two young daughters. It smells like warm, old wood and books in here; the space is filled with curios and a huge, old set of library-card-catalog drawers alongside computer monitors and a Hammond organ. You get the feeling Mercer would happily stay here forever if he didn't have video shoots, a second Broken Bells album, and a Shins world tour to attend to. But nobody ever said being an indie-rock elder statesman was a stay-at-home gig.
 I always loved these auteurs who presented themselves as bands — Neutral Milk Hotel, the Lilys — and I just felt, "Why am I not allowed to do that?" And I love the concept of the Shins. I felt it could come along with me. This record was made with a cast of characters revolving around me, which I think is something I would have been afraid to do in the past. Working with Brian [Burton, on 2010's self-titled Broken Bells album] got me over a lot of fears of collaborating with people and revealing just how flawed I am as a player and a writer. I realized I can do that stuff. I'm good enough. I don't need to be so nervous. I don't know why I was so shy. I was really shy as a kid. My good friend [and original Shins bandmate] Neal Langford had to pull me out of my room to get me to play in a band at all.
I was probably 21. We were called Subculture and I just played my guitar very quietly in the background. But it got me out of my shell and gave me a social life. 
 Later, you and Neal founded the band Flake Music together in Albuquerque. That's where you started working on the Shins material, too, right? 
Yeah. Albuquerque offers all sorts of cool things, like, the first Shins show was opening up for Cibo Matto. Bands need gas money, so they'll play Albuquerque. They're not bringing an opener, so the local yokels can play with these national bands.
 People think the Shins have a Portland type of sound: literate, poppy, sorta folky. But where's Albuquerque in your sound? 
The fact that I'm often pushing my voice as hard as I can is from playing in nightclubs in Albuquerque where you don't have a good sound system. You just have to try to beat out the guitars, amps, and drums. We weren't very popular in Albuquerque. Anything really macho, really heavy, and aggressive is successful there.
Total rebellion. The most punk-rock fucking thing I could do in my life was something like "New Slang." That was just, like, flipping off the whole city. It's definitely a moment in my life, that sort of angst and confusion about what my future was going to be. The Shins weren't anything when I wrote that song. There wasn't any hope for anything like a music career. It's that end-of-your-20s thing. Before you knew it, my whole life was upside down: I got signed, I quit my job, I moved out of town, the big relationship I'd had for five years ended. All of a sudden my whole life was up in smoke. 
 You were 31 when the Shins exploded in 2001. How do you think your age affected the choices you made? 
I know the bleakness of dead-end job after dead-end job, and I finally knew this was my one thing, this is what I do well. So I was pragmatic — when one of my own bandmates would be mocking me to my face, I didn't let it break up the band. We would talk and get on the same page somehow. A band takes more work than a 24-year-old is willing to put into it. At least me at 24, I'd have been like, "Fuck this."
Working at a Shoney's restaurant. Working at Michaels, the hobby store, in the framing department. Then I had a job where I worked at a factory that made Southwestern-type sconces. We did a billion Kokopelli guys.
Impressing Amy Linton [of the Aislers Set]. I wanted the coolest person in Albuquerque to think I was cool. She was in a band called Henry's Dress that got signed and they moved to San Francisco, which I really resented them for. And she was just super cool. She's still super cool.
I would like to be in a position where I didn't have to tour or do [publicity] so much. Stephin Merritt seems to have done so much really solid work that he can make a living without having to be a star. When he feels like it would be enjoyable, he'll play a show. My hope is that one day I'll be able to work and have a quieter life, but still a creative life. Now you play shows, do interviews, and do your best to get on Saturday Night Live. And that's great for the sales. I own the [Port of Morrow] master. I have to be thinking about the business end.
 How does starting your own label, Aural Apothecary, and owning your masters change how you feel about the business side? 
It feels good. It's probably some sort of argument that Ron Paul would use for some bullshit thing — just the fact that I own it and I'm doing my best to get it out there makes you feel less exploited and more like you're doing something for yourself and your family.
No, I'm so not political. I do like talking with friends about big concepts, you know, the stuff that will ruin a party. To me, the party hasn't begun until we're talking about the nonexistence of God.
 How do you think those "big concepts" play out in your music? Your lyrics are certainly critical of people selling a single idea of life. 
The idea that someone would have the audacity to think they should enforce their convictions on another person is fascinating to me. Brian [Burton] actually pointed this out about me. He said, "You care so much about the truth that you overlook the fact that most people could not care less. They don't give a shit about the truth." I was kind of offended, but I realized pretty quickly that it was true. There's no real reason for me to be so obsessed with trying to understand the true nature of things. You can live a perfectly happy life being utterly confused and not knowing.
When I sit out here and I pick up a guitar and I'm playing and trying to come up with melodies — when you're not thinking about anything — that's when the good stuff starts to happen. I'm hoping the outward stuff, the fame and all that, can't affect that precise moment. What it can affect is your work ethic. Most people, if they're my age and doing pop, are starting to get a little washed-up — maybe they get too confident. I feel like my insecurities are my best friends because they keep me critical of myself and what I'm doing. Hopefully, it stays healthy. Don't do it if you're not going to do it well. I could always go back to Michaels.
After Oh, Inverted World, I realized I was starting to be able to have an income that was on par with the other 30-year-olds around me. I thought, "Whoa. Let's maintain." If we work hard and tour, we can actually have a proper life where you could get married and have kids. I remember being 15 or 16 [living in England] and thinking about who I wanted to be when I was 30. I pictured myself as one of those men you see on the Tube; somebody who has a proper job and wears a tie. I remember thinking I'd be some sort of young professional. That was the best I could hope for.
U2 were super cool when I moved over there. I loved the Cure. Echo and the Bunnymen. And I loved the Sex Pistols; I really got into them. My friends, we were always sharing mixtapes. A lot of punk bands — Circle Jerks and Black Flag. And the House of Love was a band on Creation Records that I really loved. Sonic Youth, the Jesus and Mary Chain…all the shit that was cool back then.
I had one girlfriend in high school — Darla. I guess I had a two-week thing with a girl named Keiko, and she dumped me for a drummer, another Jamez. With a "Z." He had a mustache. I was so bummed.
I do! I drummed on [Port of Morrow opener] "The Rifle's Spiral." I did the bulk of the drumming on that one. The cool rolls are Janet Weiss. She broke a stick on "Simple Song." She's just a monster. She's so good.
 You rattle off all those bands you loved, but now the Shins are a touchstone for another generation. You're one of the band names that you pop in Pandora. 
It's so weird. There's apparently a nightclub in London that has a "New Slang" night with indie folk/rock. That was one of those moments when I was like, "Whoa, that's crazy." But it's interesting to hear you say that we're an established band. It's not a joke thing. It's a legitimate band.
I met Johnny Marr [when he was playing guitar with Modest Mouse] at a backyard barbecue not far from here, with a fire pit and cheap beer. I did not recognize him at all. I recognized the Northern English accent. I didn't know he was doing a mod look nowadays. I just have my Smiths records with pictures of him with a bouffant. I was like, I'm shaking Johnny Marr's hand. And he was telling me about how [Modest Mouse] really loved Chutes Too Narrow, and they would listen to it when they were going back and forth from the studio with some other famous dude. That 15-year-old kid wouldn't have believed it; it would've felt like, "You're gonna be okay and you're gonna win the fucking lottery. Not only are you not going to be a loser forever, but you're going to actually have this 
It was [Modest Mouse and current Shins drummer] Joe Plummer's house. But Isaac probably showed up at some point and danced in the fire.
I think it is. It's partly because of what used to be a big part of the economy: drunken sailors spending ridiculous cash on fun and debauchery. Music is always so closely related to all the vices. If you're going to be in a band, you're going to be exposed to everything you're not supposed to ever hear about in church. So, all the bars and nightclubs combined with the fact that Portland's a relatively inexpensive place to live means there's the right seeds to have a kick-ass music scene.
 In 2009, you went from playing with a group of people you had worked with for more than a decade to collaborating with Danger Mouse to scoring documentaries to starring in a movie [Portland director Matt McCormick's Some Days Are Better Than Others]. 
You know what was really a moment for me? And I don't want to sound pretentious or weird about this — I was asked to go perform a song at Heath Ledger's memorial service in L.A. [in 2008]. Heath was a really nice guy and a charismatic person. He influenced the people around him and was so engaged with them and had such deep relationships. He was the opposite of me. I felt like I was a ghost when I left. The outpouring of emotion for him was so moving. It scared me and it changed me. I felt like Scrooge after he's exposed to what his life could be if he continued on his way. So, the first thing I did afterwards was this trip I had been offered to travel down to Chile and play music with this documentary crew. I said yes, which I would've never done. And then it was yes to Brian. I started saying yes when people offered new experiences. I was just like, "I've gotta fucking change."
 Was that before you stopped working with [ex-Shins] Dave Hernandez, Marty Crandall, and Jesse Sandoval? 
Yes. It was tremendously difficult. I don't like disappointing people, so it was just excruciating, but I felt I needed to do it. I don't want people to think of me as a jerk or inconsiderate of those good people's feelings or their future. Both Dave and Marty play on Port of Morrow. And I will probably work with Jesse and Neal [Langford] again, recording and touring live. I try not to think about it as a firing as much as a new phase in the process. I'm telling you, there are things those guys can do that no one else can do. If a song needs them, that's what it's gotta have, if they're willing.
The exuberant side would be "Simple Song." The more wry, confident side would be "The Rifle's Spiral," where I just feel comfortable spittin' it.
They stayed with us for more than a month: two kids and a mom from north of Tokyo. It was through our daughter's Montessori school. The idea was that there were people who just needed to get out of Japan for the summer. We're just in love with them. We took 'em all over — to the coast, to the zoo. And Marisa learned a lot about Japanese cooking. Now we're pen pals. 
Nope. By the very end, a friend of the mom's figured it out and explained it to her. She looked me up on the Internet and said, "Oh, you're a singer."
No. I made a bird's nest. A giant bird's nest for my daughters. [He points out the studio window to a big, UFO-looking object in his backyard.] It's so easy. And it kind of makes you excited about pruning the trees because it's like, "Oh yeah! More shit to put in the bird's nest!" And it just keeps getting better and better.

The Shins are an American indie rock band founded and fronted by vocalist and multi-instrumentalist, James Mercer. The Shins were formed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, but are now based in Portland, Oregon.
The Shins began in 1996 as a side project for singer/songwriter James Mercer, whose primary band was Flake Music in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Mercer formed Flake Music in 1992 with Neal Langford on guitar, Phil Higgs and then Marty Crandall on bass, and Jesse Sandoval on drums. During the next 5 years Flake Music released several singles, a full-length album, and began touring largely due to the help of other bands like Modest Mouse.
In 1996, Mercer began writing what would eventually become The Shins' first record. Flake Music came to an end around this time leaving Mercer with an opportunity to record, "Nature Bears A Vacuum" a 7" EP released by Omnibus Records. For their earliest shows, The Shins performed as a duo with Mercer recruiting Sandoval to play drums. "Nature Bears A Vacuum" was released with no expectations of expanding the band's following beyond Albuquerque. However, the single generated enough attention that Mercer felt it necessary to assemble a full band. Crandall was brought into the fold on keyboards, and Dave Hernandez (frontman of local punk legends Scared of Chaka, which had played dozens of shows with Flake Music) was given bass duties.
At a San Francisco performance with Modest Mouse in 2000, Sub Pop's Jonathan Poneman asked The Shins to contribute a single to the label's Single of the Month Club, which eventually became an offer to release The Shins' 2001 single, "New Slang", and their debut album, "Oh, Inverted World". The group spent the rest of the year touring. The release of singles such as "Know Your Onion!" and "The Past and Pending" kept The Shins' success going into 2002, cementing "Oh, Inverted World" as one of the definitive indie-rock albums of the early '00s and The Shins as one of the genre's leading younger bands. It received critical acclaim for its lyrically deft and jangly pop sound. The song "One By One All Day" was featured in the 2003 film A Guy Thing, starring Jason Lee. Two other songs from this album, ("Caring Is Creepy" and "New Slang") were featured prominently on the soundtrack for the 2004 film Garden State, starring and directed by Zach Braff, exposing the music of The Shins to a much wider audience.[2] Their music was also featured in the television series The OC, the film The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie and they performed on an episode of Gilmore Girls. Oh, Inverted World appeared at #71 on Pitchfork Media's Top 100 Albums of 2000–2004.
The band relocated from Albuquerque to Portland, OR in 2001. Mercer, Sandoval and Crandall made the move. Neal Langford decided to leave the band, staying in Albuquerque so he could continue with another of his passions, professional hot air ballooning. Dave Hernandez (at this point living in nearby Seattle) rejoined The Shins in 2003 playing guitar and bass. The band began tracking new material in Mercer's basement that summer. In an effort to balance the home-recording method used on Oh, Inverted World with a studio finish, producer Phil Ek (Built To Spill, Modest Mouse) was brought in to mix and produce the album. Chutes Too Narrow was released by Sub Pop in the fall of 2003 to much fanfare in indie music circles, featuring even more multi-layered lyrics, as well as a musical approach that explored new genres, song structures, and levels of production fidelity. In 2006, the band helped to curate an edition of the British All Tomorrow's Parties festival. Nonstop touring of everywhere from Australia to Norway, as well as the US countless times over contributed to pushing sales past 500,000 worldwide, exceeding everyone's expectations, including the band's. Chutes Too Narrow appeared at #47 on Pitchfork Media's Top 100 Albums of 2000–2004.
An enhanced single release in 2004 included a live version of "New Slang" recorded with Iron and Wine, a studio mix of "Fighting in a Sack," a multimedia tack of "So Says I," and a cover of the Marc Bolan song "Baby Boomerang". The Shins have also recorded a cover of "We Will Become Silhouettes" by The Postal Service, which was released on that group's 2003 single "Such Great Heights". On May 9, 2005, the video for "Pink Bullets" (directed by Adam Bizanski), was one of the first videos to demonstrate iTunes music store's new capability to sell videos.
In a Pitchfork Media interview, Mercer announced that Eric Johnson of fellow Sub Pop band Fruit Bats had joined the Shins.
The band's third album, Wincing the Night Away, was recorded in Portland during 2006 by a largely solo Mercer, but with the production assistance of Joe Chiccarelli.[6] It was released on January 23, 2007 and debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 album chart with 118,000 copies sold in its first week, the highest sales week and chart position an album released solely on Sub Pop has ever achieved. The album was leaked to the Internet on October 20, 2006 and was available for pre-order on iTunes, with an extra track.[citation needed] It was nominated for a 2008 Grammy award in the category of Best Alternative Music Album.
In 2007 the band did a Take-Away show acoustic video session shot by Vincent Moon, and recorded a version of "Little Boxes" for the Showtime series Weeds.[citation needed] On November 27, 2007, the group was featured on a Darfur charity album released by Waxploitation.
After a year as this lineup, during which half the songs on debut album "Oh, Inverted World" (including "New Slang") were penned, Hernandez moved to New York City. Neal Langford was selected as his replacement, and it was this lineup that saw the group embark on a tour with Modest Mouse.
On June 20, 2008, the band announced that their three record Sub Pop contract had been fulfilled and that the next Shins' record would be released on James Mercer's own label, Aural Apothecary.
On July 26th, 2011, the band announced via Facebook that they would soon release news about upcoming shows and new music.
On August 1, 2011 Pitchfork reported that The Shins would be releasing an album in 2012 on Mercer's Aural Apothecary Label, via Columbia Records. The Shins also announced additional tour dates for their North American tour. The new band backing Mercer on this tour include singer/songwriter Richard Swift, Modest Mouse drummer Joe Plummer, Yuuki Matthews of Crystal Skulls and Jessica Dobson. On December 14th, they announced on their website that their upcoming album would be titled Port of Morrow and would be released March 2012. They revealed the cover art for the album as well, designed by Jacob Escobedo. They also released their first track form the new album "Simple Song" on January 9th.
=======================================================
James Mercer's father was Thomas Mercer (born at Upholland, Lancashire about 1852) who was a bank cashier. His mother was Sarah Alice Mercer (born in Liverpool about 1858). James had eight younger siblings: Mary (born about 1885), Alice (born 1887), Richard (born 1889) and Thomas (born about 1891), Frank (born about 1893), Eric (born 1894), Sarah (born about 1897) and Ernest (born about 1899).
James Mercer was educated in Liverpool, attending University College there before entering Trinity College Cambridge to study the mathematical Tripos. Among his contemporaries there were G N Watson and J E Littlewood while he was taught by Whitehead, Whittaker and Hardy. Hardy had just come onto the staff at Trinity and he acted as a private tutor to Mercer. In [2] Littlewood describes the Mathematical Tripos examinations which he and Mercer sat. Describing Part I of the Tripos, Littlewood writes:-
[The examination] consisted of 7 papers ('first four days') on comparatively elementary subjects, the riders, however, being quite stiff, followed a week later by another 7 ('second four days'). A pass on the first four days qualified for a degree, but the second four days carried double the marks, and since it was impossible to revise everything the leading candidates concentrated on the second four days ... On the problem paper [for the first four days] Mercer got 270 out of 760 for 18 questions (I got only 180). ... In the second four days (ignoring the problem paper) Mercer and I each got about 2050 out of 4500 (each about 330 out of 1340 in the 18 question problem paper).
Mercer graduated in 1907 bracketed Senior Wrangler (first equal) with Littlewood. He was awarded a Smith's prize and, in 1909, he was elected a Fellow of Trinity. He returned to his home town of Liverpool for a while, being appointed as an Assistant Lecturer there, but soon after, when the opportunity came to return to Cambridge, he accepted a Fellowship and Lectureship in Christ's College.
During the First World War Mercer served as a Naval Instructor. He saw active service at the Battle of Jutland, the only major encounter between the British and German fleets during the First World War. Fought off the coast of Denmark, it began on 31 May 1916. The battle was inconclusive but the British fleet suffered heavy losses. Mercer survived the battle and at the end of the war returned to his duties at Cambridge.
Back in Cambridge he resumed his mathematical research, continuing his work on function theory. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1922 but after this time his health, which had been poor for some time, began to fail. He took ill health retirement in 1926.
Mercer was a mathematical analyst of originality and skill; he made noteworthy advances in the theory of integral equations, and especially in the theory of the expansion of arbitrary functions in series of orthogonal functions. His output of original work would no doubt have been much larger had he not been continually hampered by bad health.
Mercer's theorem about the uniform convergence of eigenfunction expansions for kernels of operators appears in his 1909 paper Functions of positive and negative types and their connection with the theory of integral equations published in the Philosophical Transactions. There have been many papers written since then generalising Mercer's theorem to various other settings. For example Mathematical Reviews contains at least 65 papers studying such generalisations which have been published since 1980.
