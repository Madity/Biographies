Jennifer Mary "Jenna" Elfman (born September 30, 1971) is an American television and film actress. She is best known for her roles as Dharma Freedom Finkelstein Montgomery on the 1997–2002 American television sitcom Dharma & Greg and as Anna Riley in the 2000 feature film Keeping the Faith.
Elfman was born Jennifer Mary Butala in Los Angeles, California, the youngest of three children, to Sue (Grace) Butala, a homemaker, and Richard Butala, a Hughes Aircraft executive.[1] Her father's younger brother, Elfman's uncle, is Tony Butala, lead singer since 1958 of the American vocal trio The Lettermen. She is of Croatian ancestry on her father's side[2] and was raised Roman Catholic.[3]
Taking ballet classes since the age of five, Elfman became a classically trained ballet dancer and attended high school at the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts. She then attended college at California State University, Northridge (CSUN)[4]
Elfman began her professional career as a dancer, appearing in the music video for "Halo", a song by Depeche Mode from the 1990 album Violator, a video that was exclusively included on the band's 1990 music video compilation Strange Too. She stars in the video for Anthrax's 1993 song "Black Lodge". She also danced in the video for Chris Isaak's 1995 single "Somebody's Crying" and toured with the rock band ZZ Top on their 1994 World Tour as a "Legs Girl".
After appearing in numerous national television commercials, most notably as the girl in the Honda ad who said "Regular or Decaf?", Elfman landed her first principal cast acting role on the short-lived 1996 American sitcom entitled Townies on ABC. Although the show didn't catch on with viewers, it did impress critics, particularly the performances of Elfman and co-star Lauren Graham. Soon after, 20th Century Fox began talking to Elfman about developing her own sitcom.[5] Elfman thus started her five-year run as Dharma Freedom Finkelstein Montgomery in the American comedy series Dharma & Greg on ABC.
Elfman guest starred in two episodes of Two and a Half Men in 2004 and one episode of Brothers and Sisters in 2007. She made a guest appearance in the sixth episode of season four of My Name Is Earl as a cheer team leader.[6]
Elfman starred in the CBS comedy Courting Alex in 2006,[7] then starred in Accidentally on Purpose for CBS three years later during the 2009–10 television season.[8] The show was canceled after a single (2009–2010) season.
She appeared in a supporting role in a feature film, Friends with Benefits, starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis, released in 2011. Also in 2011, she returned to do a cameo appearance on the Two and a Half Men Season 9 premiere episode reprising her "Dharma" character together with former co-star Thomas Gibson ("Greg").
In 2012, Elfman and her husband, Bodhi, started their podcast, Kicking and Screaming by Jenna and Bodhi Elfman.[11]
Elfman played a fictional version of the First Lady of the United States in 1600 Penn, a 2013 comedy series on NBC that ran for one season.[12]
In July 2013, Elfman was cast in the NBC comedy Growing Up Fisher as Joyce Fisher, the wife of a blind man struggling as the patriarch, which was cancelled after one season.[13]
Also in July 2013, it was announced that Jenna has a guest-starring role on the August 28 episode of USA Network's Royal Pains as Lacy, a reformed party girl.[14]
In February 2006, Elfman donated an hour of her time to be auctioned to the highest bidder on eBay as part of the "Lunch with a Leader" fundraiser, the proceeds of which benefit the work of Communities in Schools.[15] She also participated in the auction in 2007[16] and 2008.[17]
Elfman donated her lip print for a limited edition U.S. postage stamp created by Zazzle to celebrate Valentine's Day in both 2007[18] and 2008.[19] Proceeds for the "Kiss Stamps" went to support the programs of The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS). In February 2011, she filmed a PSA for The Humane Society of the United States to inspire people to donate to help animals.[20]
As a criminal rehabilitation activist, Elfman has traveled to Washington, D.C., to lobby for criminal reform. On April 5, 2007, she was presented with the Goodwill Ambassador Award for her work in human rights and criminal rehabilitation at the Women Ambassadors Foundation 12th Annual Conference.[21] On April 9, 2008, she was a guest[22] at the signing of a new bill by U.S. President George W. Bush that aimed to reduce prisoner recidivism, entitled the Second Chance Act of 2007 (H.R. 1593).[23]
In September 2008, Elfman joined the charity: water month-long "September Campaign," asking for donations in lieu of birthday gifts in order to raise money to build freshwater wells in Ethiopia.[24] She ran a second charity: water birthday campaign in September 2011 to aid in funding a drilling rig for wells in Northern Ethiopia.[25]
On January 22, 2010, Elfman donated her time to participate in the Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief telethon in Los Angeles, California.[26]
On March 2, 2011, she participated in the National Education Association (NEA) Read Across America program by reading to school children in Compton, California in honor of Dr. Seuss' birthday.[27]
Elfman walked the catwalk in The Heart Truth Red Dress Collection 2012 Fashion Show in New York on February 8, 2012 to raise awareness for heart disease. The annual event is headed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.[28]
On March 6, 2012, Elfman hosted Laugh For Sight's[29] comedy show at The Improv in Los Angeles to benefit the Scheie Eye Institute at the University of Pennsylvania.[30]
On April 14, 2012, Elfman hosted an environmentally friendly themed charity event at her home in Los Angeles, California for the purpose of the party's attendees to learn more about the Healthy Child Healthy World "Healthy Child Party" program and Best for Babes, a breastfeeding advocacy organization.[31]
Elfman met her husband, actor Bodhi Elfman, at a Sprite commercial audition in February 1991. They married on February 18, 1995, making director Richard Elfman her father-in-law and composer Danny Elfman her uncle-in-law.
On July 23, 2007, Elfman and her husband's first child, a son, Story Elias, was born in Los Angeles.[32] On September 16, 2009, when Elfman announced she was expecting her second child, she suggested that the pregnancy would help with her role in Accidentally on Purpose.[33] On March 2, 2010, their son, Easton Quinn Monroe, was born.[34]
In 2005, Elfman appeared at the Scientology-backed Citizens Commission on Human Rights' "Psychiatry: An Industry of Death"[35] museum grand opening and she and husband Bodhi are listed on the organization's website as members of the board of advisers from the arts, entertainment and media community.[36]
On May 24, 2006, she was the keynote speaker at the Human Rights Hero Award event in participation with the Scientology-affiliated groups Youth for Human Rights International and Artists for Human Rights (AFHR), an organization formed with the purpose of bringing artists together with the common cause of raising awareness of human rights around the world. The event took place in Washington, D.C. and was attended by members of Congress and the general public. Awards were presented to individuals who through their actions have brought about greater human rights.[37]
On March 27, 2008, Elfman and Charlie Sheen co-hosted the Scientology-affiliated New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project Charity Event at Geisha House in Hollywood.[38]

      Creatively, you need to go live life. As an artist, you are representing life. So you have to rub elbows and be out in it.
      I think that marriage is an amazing institution and should be preserved, and you can have great marriages, and you must because sharing your life with someone is like the greatest thing. And I loved being able to set a good example for that on television.
      I loved that about her because I knew it would open the door for a lot of comedy, because I knew that the conflict would come, because not many people live like the way she does.
      I just think that it's such a good show and timeless and still very funny, and that just makes me happy to have that whole first season in one concentrated space for people to enjoy so that it's not hit and miss trying to find it in syndication always.
      I just think it's fun to remind people that good television has exited and it can exist again and just to give them pleasure and enjoy it and make them laugh.
      I just kind of understood it, and I threw my love for others and love for life into the character, and was having a blast. I loved playing Dharma. I loved it!
      I got good notice from that show, and on the last day of filming Townies (1996), Twentieth Century Fox called, wanting to meet with me about a development deal.
      I can't say I can foresee the future and tell the stars, you know. But I do have an understanding for my own reality, just elements and things that I've learned from.
      Especially while television I think is going through some growing pains or is in need of - I think current comedy is a bit, uh, not happening, you know?
      Comedy is much more challenging, because you have to have the same level of belief but you have to make people laugh, and that's definitely a challenge.
      And you know, we did it as an independent film, and we weren't expecting it to be on television, and Lifetime ended up buying it. And the viewers responded intensely to that film.
      It's such a pleasurable experience to look back, and all of the fun I had just comes rushing back.
      In comedy, something may be more absurd, but you have to believe just as much as you do when you're doing drama.
      Not hippie - my parents were not hippies - but they were very supportive and encouraging, and that does a lot for someone, and it gives them a lot of confidence.
      And I'm so excited to remind people and even gain new fans who find out about Dharma - a new generation who could find out about Dharma and enjoy her and all the characters on the show.
      And as a character, what I found very inspiring about playing Dharma, especially at that time, is that the women on television were more neurotic than they were free. And I thought, this is a rare bird and this is unique on television and I think it's really refreshing.
      You know, she was a girl. She was a female. And she wasn't like, trying to compete in a man's world and she wasn't trying to be in a man's position, she was just who she was. And I think that was like, a good thing.
      Yeah, I think the common denominator - and this is probably going to sound like Acting 101 - but the common denominator is belief in the character in the moment.
      There's a power in women being women. There's a role for men, but we don't have to be men, because we're women. I think that representing that on television is a cool thing.
      Playing in front of an audience was just such a turn-on for me, and you have 200 people in the audience and it's like doing live theater. And filming something that goes to millions of people several weeks later, it's an interesting dynamic.
      It was the most pleasurable thing I've ever done, playing this character, and I just remember feeling so at home and so - I don't know, I was just happy - and it just wasn't ever work! It was like a sandbox for me, and I would crack myself up rehearsing.
      I'll probably stick to comedy for the time being. I mean, a great piece of work is a great piece of work, and I'm up for good work anytime. But I do love comedy!

With statuesque sex appeal and an adorably loopy persona, Elfman made her name on the small screen in the sitcom Dharma & Greg. Originally a dancer, she switched to acting in her twenties and soon began landing guest spots on a variety of TV shows. But it was a regular gig on the short-lived sitcom Townies that led to Elfman's breakthrough role. During her tenure on Dharma, she earned three Emmy nods and a Golden Globe, co-hosted the Emmys and attempted to launch a film career with romantic comedies like EDtv and Keeping the Faith. But despite her height, the big screen somehow dwarfed Elfman's charms. After the demise of Dharma in the early '00s, she slowed the pace and reportedly devoted much of her time to her religion, Scientology. Elfman re-emerged in 2006 as the star of the single-in-the-city sitcom Courting Alex, which ran for only one season. After spending a couple more years away from the small screen, Elfman attempted another TV comeback in 2009 with the CBS sitcom Accidentally on Purpose, which cast her as a movie critic who gets pregnant after a one-night stand.Jenna Elfman Fast Facts:

Insults never sounded sweeter than when Don Rickles was hurling hilarious barbs at his targets, whether innocent ringside onlookers or the rich and famous on a celebrity roast dais. At 88, though stooped and using a cane, he still gives as good as he gets, a fact brought home with delightful wit and genuine lump-in-the-throat sentiment in Spike TV's One Night Only: An All-Star Tribute to Don Rickles (Wednesday, 9/8c).

This week's gold-medal question: Can NBC reverse its spotty track record when it comes to using the ratings boost of the Olympics to launch new programs? (Remember the Summer 2012 debacle when the network interrupted the flow of London's Closing Ceremony to inflict Animal Practice on an unwilling captive audience?)
The news is better this weekend, during the closing nights of the Games. The comedies getting a sneak peek are considerably more entertaining than Animal Practice — what wouldn't be? — and they won't air until after that night's Olympics packages are finished.

Jenna speaks at her high school alma mater, the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts. Telling them about her personal journey from dancing to acting, setting career goals, staying true to yourself, and honoring your passion for the arts.
IMAX and Dreamworks joined forces to put out a three dimensional venture, titled Cyberworld.  A mosaic of eight animated features designed for 3-D viewing.  Jenna was the voice of 'Phig', a computer generated emcee who guides the audience through the animated chronicles.
CBS searched for a writer to team up with Jenna to pen a personalized script just for her.  After finding what they thought was the perfect combination of writers, they created Courting Alex.
Jenna spoke in Canada at a non-religious criminal rehabilitation program that she works with, called Criminon.
Jenna was nominated three times for an Emmy Award and nominated three times for a Golden Globe, with one win, for  Dharma & Greg.
Jenna and her husband are practicing Scientologists. He introduced her to the religion shortly after meeting her.
She graduated from Los Angeles High School for the Arts, class of 1989. She was senior class representative (dance dept), on Student Arts Council.

Jenna: Scientology is going nowhere. I will tell you that right now, because it works and so many people are helped by it. The people who have been helped aren't going anywhere because they know it's true for them.
Jenna: I was raised well enough to have an appreciation of myself and know that you have to be well-rested and well-fed to get anything done.
Jenna: I was raised Catholic and went to Catholic school and I married a Jew so I have both sides. I don't joke and degrade about religions, and I don't appreciate other people doing it, either.
Jenna: And as a character, what I found very inspiring about playing Dharma, especially at that time, is that the women on television were more neurotic than they were free. And I thought, this is a rare bird and this is unique on television and I think it's really refreshing.
Jenna: (on doing Dharma and Gregg) It was the most pleasurable thing I've ever done, playing this character, and I just remember feeling so at home and so - I don't know, I was just happy - and it just wasn't ever work!
Jenna: What a beautiful upbringing. Whether it's hippie or regimented, I was brought up similarly. Not hippie - my parents were not hippies - but they were very supportive and encouraging, and that does a lot for someone, and it gives them a lot of confidence.
Jenna:  I was never anorexic because I saw too much of that going on around me, and I was raised well enough to evaluate what that was when I was thirteen.  I tried for a day to eat only an apple, and I couldn't do it.  I went home and ate my dinner.
Jenna:  I have been styling my own hair since I was four years old, when I used to put it in pony tails, or make Princess Leia buns. I wouldn't even let my mom do my hair, and I still don't let anyone else touch it to this day.  I cut, color, style, and spray my own hair, on all sets and shoots, that's just the way it goes. I get way too nervous when someone else starts to mess with it.
Dharma and Greg was a terrible show and she was the worst thing on it.. She was not "quirky" she was annoying. IF the show was focused on Greg's parents instead of a loud mouth know it all, it could have been great. Greg's father was hilarious and his Mom was sexier than Dharma. Now she has a new show, again, and I am just as sure that it will flop as I am that she will get another show after it for some reason. Why are some stars allowed to fail over and over, like Jenna, Christina Applegate, and Matthew Perry, while more taltented people, like Norm Macdonald and the whole cast of Community seem to just fade away? Go to Hell Jenna Elfman, and take Jennifer Aniston, Chelsea Handler , and the mom from Malcom in the Middle with you.moreless

"I'm not some big party chick, so it's not like I have to keep up my big social life."  -Jenna Elfman
                She starred in the hit sitcom Dharma & Greg from 1997 to 2002, and has starred in great movies such as EDtv and Keeping the Faith.             
                Although Jenna tends more toward the cute side of the sexy spectrum, she's recently begun to shed that good girl image and take on a more seductive role. We think that Jenna, who has legs up to there, should develop this sexy streak.            
                Her bubbly onscreen persona has caught the attention of more than just prime-time viewers; it has caught the attention of movie executives, who see her as a girl next door with the longest legs in history. And since Jenna said goodbye to her sitcom in 2002, we have yet to get ongoing glimpses of the babe with the million-dollar smile.  Luckily, she's taken on the big screen in films like EDtv, Keeping the Faith and Town & Country. Nevertheless, we think that Jenna should get back to television and give us back that weekly dose.            
                Jenna Elfman, nee Jennifer Mary Butala, was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, on September 30, 1971. As a child, Elfman had aspirations to become a nun, but it soon became clear that she had more of a knack for entertainment than she thought. By the age of 5, Jenna's parents put her in a classical dance class. Elfman was an energetic young girl who was hard to control. This was especially obvious when her elementary school math teacher sealed her mouth with electrical tape so that she would pay attention to the lessons instead of entertaining her classmates.   jenna elfman heads to cal-state After graduating from high school, Elfman tried her luck with higher education by attending Cal-State Northridge College. Once she realized that she had little motivation to continue with her studies, Elfman moved across town to Hollywood, to try her luck in the entertainment business. Elfman's first instinct was to become a ballerina dancer, and she considered joining Seattle's Pacific Northwest. But it was a dance ensemble for the 1991 Academy Awards that launched Elfman's career as a dancer for film and television productions. It was a brief appearance in Murder, She Wrote that initiated her interest in acting. Soon after, Elfman enrolled at The Beverly Hills Playhouse where she studied coach Milton Katselas. jenna elfman does gross pointe blank Her first gigs -- as with most first time actors -- started with advertisement work. Elfman did some commercials for AT&T, Sprite, Clearasil, and Honda. These spots gave her the valuable experience to secure the services of an agent who secured her minor acting jobs in a few episodes in sitcoms such as Roseanne (1995) and NYPD Blue (1996). In middle of 1996, Elfman landed a part in her first feature film called Grosse Pointe Blank, and by the fall of the same year, she was cast for a recurring role in ABC's Townies, with co-stars Molly Ringwald and Lauren Graham. Her debut in a supporting role was an instant smash. And before she knew it, she had both ABC and 20th Century Fox rushing in to sign her for new development deals.  jenna elfman becomes dharma In 1997, Elfman pitched her Dharma & Greg sitcom to the powers that be at ABC.

As for her personal life, in 1995, Jenna married actor Bodhi Elfman, whom she had been dating since 1991.  They share their home with their dog, Gwenivere. She and her husband both practice Scientology, and hope to make some time from their busy schedules to have children soon. More recently in 2004, fans got to see Jenna guest-starring on the CBS, Charlie Sheen sitcom Two and a Half Men, and she was looking sexier than ever.
