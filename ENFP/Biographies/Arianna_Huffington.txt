Arianna Huffington (née Stassinopoulou; born Αριάννα Στασινοπούλου, July 15, 1950) is a Greek-American author and syndicated columnist. She is best known for her news website The Huffington Post. At one time a liberal Democrat[1][2] she later became a popular conservative commentator in the mid-1990s, after which she re-adopted liberal political beliefs in the late 1990s.[3] She is the former spouse of former Republican congressman Michael Huffington.
In 2009, Huffington was named as number 12 in Forbes' first-ever list of the Most Influential Women In Media.[5] She has also moved up to number 42 in The Guardian's Top 100 in Media List.[6]
In 2011, AOL acquired The Huffington Post for US$315 million and made Huffington President and Editor-in-Chief of The Huffington Post Media Group, which included The Huffington Post and then-existing AOL properties such as AOL Music, Engadget, Patch Media, and StyleList.[7]
Huffington was born Ariánna Stasinopoúlou in Athens, Greece, the daughter of Konstantinos (a journalist and management consultant) and Elli (née Georgiadi) Stasinopoulos, and is the sister of Agapi (an author, speaker and performer).[citation needed] She moved to the United Kingdom at the age of 16, and studied economics at Girton College, Cambridge, where she was the first foreign, and third female[8] President of the Cambridge Union.[9]
In 1971, she appeared in an edition of Face the Music along with Bernard Levin. A relationship developed, of which she wrote, after his death: "He wasn't just the big love of my life, he was a mentor as a writer and a role model as a thinker."[10] Huffington began writing books in the 1970s, with editorial help from Levin.[citation needed] The two traveled to music festivals around the world for the BBC. They spent summers touring three-star restaurants in France. At the age of 30, she remained deeply in love with him but longed to have children; Levin never wanted to marry or have children. Huffington concluded that she must break away, and moved to New York in 1980.[10]
In 1973, Arianna (as Stassinopoulou) wrote a book titled The Female Woman, attacking the Women's Liberation movement in general and Germaine Greer's 1970 The Female Eunuch in particular.
In the late 1980s, Huffington wrote several articles for National Review. In 1981, she wrote a biography of Maria Callas, Maria Callas – The Woman Behind the Legend, and in 1989, a biography of Pablo Picasso, Picasso: Creator and Destroyer.[11]
Huffington rose to national prominence during the unsuccessful Senate bid in 1994 by her then husband, Republican Michael Huffington. She became known as a reliable supporter of conservative causes such as Newt Gingrich's "Republican Revolution" and Bob Dole's 1996 candidacy for president. She teamed up with liberal comedian Al Franken as the conservative half of "Strange Bedfellows"[12] during Comedy Central's coverage of the 1996 U.S. presidential election. For her work, she and the writing team of Politically Incorrect were nominated for a 1997 Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Variety or Music Program.[13] She has also made a few forays into acting with roles on shows such as Roseanne, The L Word, How I Met Your Mother, Help Me Help You, and the film EdTV.[14]
As late as 1998, Huffington still aligned herself with the right. During that year she did a weekly radio show in Los Angeles called "Left, Right & Center", that "match[ed] her, the right-winger, against a self-described centrist policy wonk, Matt Miller, and a veteran leftist journalist, Robert Scheer."[8] In an April 1998 profile in The New Yorker, Margaret Talbot wrote that "Most recently, she has cast herself as a kind of Republican Spice Girl - an endearingly ditzy right-wing gal-about-town who is a guilty pleasure for people who know better." Huffington described herself by side-stepping the traditional party divide, saying "the right/left divisions are so outdated now. For me, the primary division is between people who are aware of what I call 'the two nations' (rich and poor), and those who are not."[8]
Huffington opposed NATO intervention against Serbia during the Yugoslav Wars[15] and in 2000, she instigated the 'Shadow Conventions'[clarification needed], which appeared at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia and the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles at Patriotic Hall.[16]
Huffington heads The Detroit Project, a public interest group lobbying automakers to start producing cars running on alternative fuels. The project's 2003 TV ads, which equated driving sport utility vehicles to funding terrorism, proved to be particularly controversial, with some stations refusing to run them.[17]
In a 2004 appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, she announced her endorsement of John Kerry by saying, "When your house is burning down, you don't worry about the remodeling."[18] Huffington was a panel speaker during the 2005 California Democratic Party State Convention, held in Los Angeles. She also spoke at the 2004 College Democrats of America Convention in Boston, which was held in conjunction with the 2004 Democratic National Convention. Huffington is also a regular panelist on the nationally syndicated weekend radio program, Both Sides Now with Huffington & Matalin,[19] hosted by Mark Green.
Huffington was an independent candidate to recall California governor Gray Davis in the 2003 recall election. She described her candidacy against front runner Arnold Schwarzenegger as "the hybrid versus the Hummer," making reference to her ownership of a hybrid vehicle, the Toyota Prius, and Schwarzenegger's Hummer. The two would proceed to have a high-profile clash during the election's debate, during which both candidates were rebuked for making personal attacks.[citation needed]
Despite briefly retaining former U.S. Senator Dean Barkley as a campaign advisor and advertising executive Bill Hillsman as her media director, she dropped out of the race on September 30, 2003 and endorsed Governor Gray Davis' campaign to vote against the recall. Others attributed her exit to her inability to garner support for her candidacy, noting that polls showed that only about two percent of likely California voters planned to vote for her at the time of her withdrawal.[21] Though she failed to stop the recall, Huffington's name remained on the ballot and she placed 5th, capturing 47,505 votes or 0.55% of the vote.
Huffington was a panelist on the weekly BBC Radio 4 political discussion programme, Any Questions?, and the BBC television panel games Call My Bluff and Face the Music.[22] She served as co-host of BBC's late night chat show Saturday Night at The Mill for four weeks before viewer complaints caused her to be dropped from the show.[23]
Huffington is the co-host of the weekly, nationally syndicated, public radio program Both Sides Now, along with Mary Matalin, former top aide to the Bush/Cheney White House. Every week on Both Sides Now, Huffington and Matalin discuss the nation's relevant political issues, offering both sides of every issue to the listeners. Both Sides Now is hosted by former Air Radio America President and HuffPost blogger Mark J. Green.[19]
Prior to The Huffington Post, Huffington hosted a website called Ariannaonline.com. Her first foray into the Internet was a website called Resignation.com, which called for the resignation of President Bill Clinton and was a rallying place for conservatives opposing Clinton. She wrote about Clinton resigning, "Only some act of sacrifice can begin to restore the image of the President that we are left with from the Starr report -- a man of staggering narcissism and self-indulgence, whom nobody dared gainsay, investing his energies first in gratifying his sexual greeds and then in using his staff, his friends and the Secret Service to cover up the truth."[24]
In November 2008, Huffington joined the cast of Seth MacFarlane's animated series, The Cleveland Show, where she lends her voice to the wife of Tim the Bear, also named Arianna.[25]
Huffington appeared as herself in the May 10, 2010, episode of the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother.[27]
Huffington participated in the 24th annual "Distinguished Speaker Series" at the University at Buffalo, NY., on September 16, 2010. She headlined a debate against radio co-host Mary Matalin on current world events, political issues, and the local Buffalo economy. The University at Buffalo "Distinguished Speaker Series" has featured a multitude of world-renowned politicians and celebrities such as; Tony Blair, Bill Nye, Jon Stewart, and the Dalai Lama.[28]
Huffington offered to provide as many buses as necessary to transport those who want to go to Jon Stewart's Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear on October 30, 2010, from the Huffington Post Headquarters in New York City.[29] Ultimately, she paid for 150 buses to ferry almost 10,000 people from Citi Field in Queens to RFK Stadium in DC.
Huffington played herself in the Family Guy episode "Brian Writes a Bestseller" along with Dana Gould and Bill Maher in a live segment of Real Time with Bill Maher.
In 2012, Huffington became a LinkedIn Influencer, writing about success and sharing professional insights.[30]
Huffington was accused of plagiarism for copying material for her book Maria Callas (1981); the claims were settled out of court in 1981, with Callas' biographer Gerald Fitzgerald being paid "in the low five figures."[31][32][33]
Lydia Gasman, an art history professor at the University of Virginia, claimed that Huffington’s 1988 biography of Pablo Picasso, Picasso: Creator and Destroyer, included themes similar to those in her unpublished four-volume Ph.D. thesis. "What she did was steal twenty years of my work," Gasman told Maureen Orth in 1994. Gasman did not file suit.[34]
Columnist Maureen Orth also claimed that Huffington "borrowed heavily for her 1993 book, The Gods of Greece."[31]
Huffington met her future husband Michael Huffington in 1985. They were married a year later, on April 12, 1986.[35] They later moved to Santa Barbara, California, in order for him to run in 1992 as a Republican for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, which he won by a significant margin.
In 1994, Michael Huffington narrowly lost the race for the U.S. Senate seat in California to incumbent Dianne Feinstein.[36] The couple divorced in 1997.[37] They have two daughters.[38] In 1998, Michael Huffington disclosed that he is bisexual.[39]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Arianna Huffington was born on July 15, 1950 in Athens, Greece as Ariadne Anna Stassinopoulos. She is an actress and writer, known for Saturday Night at the Mill (1976), Bhutto (2010) and To the Contrary (1992). She was previously married to Michael Huffington.
      Finished fifth among the replacement candidates in the election to recall California Governor Gray Davis, despite the fact that she dropped out of the race a week before the election.
      On 25 September 2003, filed papers with the State of California to launch the "Clean Elections Initiative." Assuming enough signatures are received, it would appear on the ballot in 2004 and if passed by voters would provide for public funding of statewide election campaigns. Maine and Arizona already have so called "clean money" campaigns with much success.
      Initially opposed the California recall effort, but once enough signatures were collected to force a recall election, she jumped into the fray of candidates vying for Gov. Gray Davis's job as Governor of California. When she realized that she had no chance of winning, she dropped out of the race and once again opposed the recall effort.
      Gave birth to her 2nd child at age 40, a daughter Isabella Diana Huffington on May 15, 1991. Child's father is her ex-husband, Michael Huffington.
      Gave birth to her 1st child at age 38, a daughter Christina Sophia Huffington on May 1, 1989. Child's father is her ex-husband, Michael Huffington.
      Release of her book, "Right is Wrong: How the Lunatic Fringe Hijacked America, Shredded the Constitution and Made Us All Less Safe".
      Release of her book, "Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America".
      [Regarding her political transformation] "When I was a Republican, Saddam Hussein was our ally, George Bush owned a mediocre baseball team, Enron was a respected energy company and Michael Jackson was still black."
      My principal complaint [against California Governor Gray Davis] is that he is somebody who's brought a tremendous amount of ingenuity, creativity and passion to fund-raising, but not to governing.
      [on Kai-Fu Lee, Chinese technology innovator] His embrace of of social media lifted him from executive to icon of online freedom. In February (2013) Lee was banned from his Chinese social-media accounts after he criticized the government, in part for it's online censorship. How did he respond? By inviting his thirty million followers to follow him on Twitter. So Lee's story turns out to be a universal story - of striving for freedom (online and off), of the power of technology to circumvent the status quo, and of an individual's potential to create new opportunities that benefit not only himself and his community but the wider world.

Business & Economics - Women In Business; Biography & Autobiography - Personal Memoirs; Self Help - Success 
In Thrive, Arianna Huffington makes an impassioned and compelling case for the need to redefine what it means to be successful in today's world.   Arianna Huffington's personal wake-up call came in the form of a broken cheekbone and a nasty gash over her eye -- the result of a fall brought on by exhaustion and lack of sleep. As the cofounder and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post Media Group -- one of the fastest growing media companies in the world -- celebrated as one of the world's most influential women, and gracing the covers of magazines, she was, by any traditional measure, extraordinarily successful. Yet as she found herself going from brain MRI to CAT scan to echocardiogram, to find out if there was any underlying medical problem beyond exhaustion, she wondered is this really what success feels like?   As more and more people are coming to realize, there is far more to living a truly successful life than just earning a bigger salary and capturing a corner office. Our relentless pursuit of the two traditional metrics of success -- money and power -- has led to an epidemic of burnout and stress-related illnesses, and an erosion in the quality of our relationships, family life, and, ironically, our careers. In being connected to the world 24/7, we're losing our connection to what truly matters. Our current definition of success is, as Thrive shows, literally killing us. We need a new way forward.   In a commencement address Arianna gave at Smith College in the spring of 2013, she likened our drive for money and power to two legs of a three-legged stool. They may hold us up temporarily, but sooner or later we're going to topple over. We need a third leg -- a third metric for defining success -- to truly thrive. That third metric, she writes in Thrive, includes our well-being, our ability to draw on our intuition and inner wisdom, our sense of wonder, and our capacity for compassion and giving. As Arianna points out, our eulogies celebrate our lives very differently from the way society defines success. They don't commemorate our long hours in the office, our promotions, or our sterling PowerPoint presentations as we relentlessly raced to climb up the career ladder. They are not about our resumes -- they are about cherished memories, shared adventures, small kindnesses and acts of generosity, lifelong passions, and the things that made us laugh.   In this deeply personal book, Arianna talks candidly about her own challenges with managing time and prioritizing the demands of a career and raising two daughters -- of juggling business deadlines and family crises, a harried dance that led to her collapse and to her "aha moment." Drawing on the latest groundbreaking research and scientific findings in the fields of psychology, sports, sleep, and physiology that show the profound and transformative effects of meditation, mindfulness, unplugging, and giving, Arianna shows us the way to a revolution in our culture, our thinking, our workplace, and our lives.											
Arianna Huffington is the cofounder, president, and editor in chief of the Huffington Post Media Group, one of the world's most influential news and information brands. She is the author of fourteen books, including Third World America and On Becoming Fearless, and the mother of two daughters, Christina and Isabella.										
“In Thrive, Arianna urges all of us to get in touch with who we really are so that we can live life on our own terms. From the importance of sleep to the imperative to listen to our own inner voice for ways to deal with the daily time crunches we all feel, this book lays out a path for each of us to look within and make our lives more authentic and fulfilling.” -Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook COO and author of Lean In "At once intimate and formidable, this book is Arianna Huffington at her persuasive best. Thrive is a clarion call, a meditation, and a practical response to the question of how to live.” -Susan Cain, author of New York Times bestseller Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking "Socrates, Plato, Aristotle…Arianna. Beyond politics, there is her wisdom, applicable to everyone. This book probably added ten years to my life, some of which I'll spend re-reading it." -Bill Maher, host of Real Time with Bill Maher, bestselling author of The New Rules"Arianna Huffington has been disrupting media as we know it for her entire career. Now, in remarkably vulnerable and moving prose, she explains that money and power are a small piece of success, the most important piece is the Third Metric—which incorporates not only well being, but also wisdom, wonder and giving. Reading this book is the best thing you can do for yourself and your loved ones. A monumental work that will change your life, and your health." -David B. Agus, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Engineering, University of Southern California and author NY Times bestsellers, The End of Illness and A Short Guide to a Long Life“Thrive is an urgently needed compendium of wisdom and practical guide enabling us to create peace of mind and well-being in our ever more chaotic lives.  Filled with cutting edge scientific research, captivating stories, and straightforward everyday practices, this book is a call-to-action that informs, invigorates, and inspires all at once.  Arianna Huffington’s ingenious gift is to bring herself fully into these pages as she invites us to join her on this rewarding journey to become more connected and compassionate with ourselves and others as we change our cultural conversation about how to best live our lives.” -Daniel J. Siegel, M.D., author of Brainstorm and Mindsight, professor, UCLA School of Medicine"Arianna’s honest, raw and compelling call for us to Thrive, in the midst of a jumbled, chaotic world by redefining what matters – well-being, wisdom, wonder, service and each other – is the right book, at the right time to heal us from our disconnection to ourselves and each other." -Mark Hyman, MD, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller, The Blood Sugar Solution"In our relentless pursuit of more and more success, we have lost touch with our true selves, our bodies, our fmailies and our friends.  In Thrive Arianna brilliatnly expolores how we can climb out of our stressed out, over-committed lives and once again create lives of balance and well-being." -Jack Canfield, Co-author of The Success Principles(TM)“Once in a generation, a book comes along that can truly transform your life. This is it. Some of the most unhappy people are those who have achieved unfathomable money, power, and fame and found that it didn’t bring them the happiness they were seeking. Now what? Thrive doesn’t show just how to become more successful; it shows how to realize and experience what matters most.” —Dean Ornish, founder of Preventive Medicine Research Institute, bestselling author of The Spectrum“Thrive is a captivating look at what it takes to live a more meaningful, satisfying life.  Brimming with passion, supported by science, and crowned with practical insights, Arianna’s exceptional book will transform our workplaces, schools, and families.” -Adam Grant, Wharton professor and author of Give and Take "Arianna Huffington has written a passionate and much needed prescription for reshaping life from the inside out. Turn off your cell phone, your email, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and every other tool of the stressed-out, distracted world to spend some time thinking about grace, joy and wonder. You'll be glad you did." –Ellen Goodman, Pulitzer prize winning columnist and bestselling author of I Know Just What You Mean"Thrive is a book that makes me smile just thinking about it. It is a bookof wit, wisdom, and practical advice for changing our lives by changingour values. After all, why should we be content just to live when we canthrive?" -Anne-Marie Slaughter, professor, Princeton University, author of What Works for Women at Work"This is a generous, urgent, vital book, a chance to redefine how we keep score before it's too late. Arianna has given us a gift, and delivered it with style. Read it!" -Seth Godin, bestselling author of The Icarus Deception“So honest and personal, Arianna Huffington’s new book, Thrive, is a must read. I love the chapters on wisdom and wonder. Arianna’s message is desperately needed in today’s Type A, hurry-up world. Her book just screamed at me to slow down, turn off the inner dialogue, sleep more, and stay in daily touch with my source of being.” -Wayne Dyer“You can feel Arianna's passion for her subject on every page of this book.   Arianna has reflected on and struggled with  how best to define success ever since I met her more than 30 years ago.  In Thrive she's created a new paradigm for redefining how to systematically build a life of  purpose and balance and accomplishment— the whole life we're all ultimately after.” -Tony Schwartz, CEO, The Energy Project, author of The Way We're Working Isn't Working"Beautiful, bold and brilliant…. I must confess I did not just read this book, I entered into long conversations with it. Rarely comes a title that makes you stop whatever you are doing and look at yourself in a new light, look within. Arianna Huffington is a compassionate rebel; she not only changes the world but also understands it.
