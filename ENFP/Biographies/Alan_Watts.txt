=======================================================
Alan Wilson Watts (6 January 1915 – 16 November 1973) was a British-born philosopher, writer, and speaker, best known as an interpreter and populariser of Eastern philosophy for a Western audience. Born in Chislehurst, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began Zen training in New York. Pursuing a career, he attended Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, where he received a master's degree in theology. Watts became an Episcopal priest then left the ministry in 1950 and moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the American Academy of Asian Studies.
Watts gained a large following in the San Francisco Bay Area while working as a volunteer programmer at KPFA, a Pacifica Radio station in Berkeley. Watts wrote more than 25 books and articles on subjects important to Eastern and Western religion, introducing the then-burgeoning youth culture to The Way of Zen (1957), one of the first bestselling books on Buddhism. In Psychotherapy East and West (1961), Watts proposed that Buddhism could be thought of as a form of psychotherapy and not a religion. He also explored human consciousness, in the essay "The New Alchemy" (1958), and in the book The Joyous Cosmology (1962).
Towards the end of his life, he divided his time between a houseboat in Sausalito and a cabin on Mount Tamalpais. His legacy has been kept alive by his son, Mark Watts, and many of his recorded talks and lectures are available on the Internet. According to the critic Erik Davis, his "writings and recorded talks still shimmer with a profound and galvanizing lucidity."[3]
Watts was born to middle class parents in the village of Chislehurst, Kent (now south-east London), in 1915, living at 3 (now 5) Holbrook Lane. His father was a representative for the London office of the Michelin Tyre Company, his mother a housewife whose father had been a missionary. With modest financial means, they chose to live in pastoral surroundings and Alan, an only child, grew up playing at brookside, learning the names of wildflowers and butterflies.[4] Probably because of the influence of his mother's religious family[5] the Buchans, an interest in "ultimate things" seeped in. But it mixed with Alan's own interests in storybook fables and romantic tales of the mysterious Far East.[6]
Watts also later wrote of a mystical vision he experienced while ill with a fever as a child. During this time he was influenced by Far Eastern landscape paintings and embroideries that had been given to his mother by missionaries returning from China. The few Chinese paintings Watts was able to see in England riveted him, and he wrote "I was aesthetically fascinated with a certain clarity, transparency, and spaciousness in Chinese and Japanese art. It seemed to float...".[7] These works of art emphasized the participative relationship of man in nature, a theme that stood fast throughout his life, and one that he often writes about. See, for instance, the last chapter in The Way of Zen.[8]
By his own assessment, Watts was imaginative, headstrong, and talkative. He was sent to boarding schools (which included both academic and religious training of the Muscular Christianity sort) from early years. Of this religious training, he remarked "Throughout my schooling my religious indoctrination was grim and maudlin…"[9] Watts spent several holidays in France in his teen years, accompanied by Francis Croshaw, a wealthy Epicurean with strong interests in both Buddhism and exotic little-known aspects of European culture. It was not long afterward that Watts felt forced to decide between the Anglican Christianity he had been exposed to and the Buddhism he had read about in various libraries, including Croshaw's. He chose Buddhism, and sought membership in the London Buddhist Lodge, which had been established by Theosophists, and was now run by the barrister Christmas Humphreys. Watts became the organization's secretary at 16 (1931). The young Watts explored several styles of meditation during these years.
Watts attended The King's School, Canterbury next door to Canterbury Cathedral. Though he was frequently at the top of his classes scholastically, and was given responsibilities at school, he botched an opportunity for a scholarship to Oxford by styling a crucial examination essay in a way that was read as presumptuous and capricious.[10]
When he left high school, Watts worked in a printing house and later a bank. He spent his spare time involved with the Buddhist Lodge and also under the tutelage of a "rascal guru" named Dimitrije Mitrinović. (Mitrinović was himself influenced by Peter Demianovich Ouspensky, G. I. Gurdjieff, and the varied psychoanalytical schools of Freud, Jung and Adler.) Watts also read widely in philosophy, history, psychology, psychiatry and Eastern wisdom. By his own reckoning, and also by that of his biographer Monica Furlong, Watts was primarily an autodidact. His involvement with the Buddhist Lodge in London afforded Watts a considerable number of opportunities for personal growth. Through Humphreys, he contacted eminent spiritual authors (e.g., Nicholas Roerich [an artist, scholar, and mystic], Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, and prominent theosophists like Alice Bailey). In 1936, aged 21, he attended the World Congress of Faiths at the University of London, heard D. T. Suzuki read a paper, and afterwards was able to meet this esteemed scholar of Zen Buddhism.[11] Beyond these discussions and personal encounters, Watts absorbed, by studying the available scholarly literature, the fundamental concepts and terminology of the main philosophies of India and East Asia.
In 1936, Watts's first book was published, The Spirit of Zen. In The Way of Zen[12] he disparaged The Spirit of Zen as a "popularisation of Suzuki's earlier works, and besides being very unscholarly it is in many respects out of date and misleading."
In 1938 he and his bride left England to live in America. Watts would become an American citizen in 1943.[13] He had married Eleanor Everett, whose mother Ruth Fuller Everett was involved with a traditional Zen Buddhist circle in New York. A few years later, Ruth Fuller married the Zen master (or "roshi"), Sokei-an Sasaki, who served as a sort of model and mentor to Watts, though he chose not to enter into a formal Zen training relationship with Sasaki. During these years, according to his later writings, Watts had another mystical experience while on a walk with his wife.
Watts's fascination with the Zen (or Ch'an) tradition—beginning during the 1930s—developed because that tradition embodied the spiritual, interwoven with the practical, as exemplified in the subtitle of his Spirit of Zen: A Way of Life, Work, and Art in the Far East. "Work," "life," and "art" were not demoted due to a spiritual focus. In his writing, he referred to it as "the great Ch'an (or Zen) synthesis of Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism after A.D. 700 in China."[14]
Watts left formal Zen training in New York because the method of the teacher did not suit him. He was not ordained as a Zen monk, but he felt a need to find a professional outlet for his philosophical inclinations. He entered Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, an Episcopal (Anglican) school in Evanston, Illinois, where he studied Christian scriptures, theology, and church history. He attempted to work out a blend of contemporary Christian worship, mystical Christianity, and Asian philosophy. Watts was awarded a master's degree in theology in response to his thesis, which he published as a popular edition under the title Behold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity of Mystical Religion. The pattern was set, in that Watts did not hide his dislike for religious outlooks that he decided were dour, guilt-ridden, or militantly proselytizing—no matter if they were found within Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, or Buddhism.
All seemed to go reasonably well in his next role, as Episcopal priest (beginning in 1945, aged 30), until an extramarital affair resulted in his young wife having their marriage annulled. It also resulted in Watts leaving the ministry by 1950. He spent the New Year getting to know Joseph Campbell and Campbell's wife, Jean Erdman; as well as John Cage the notable composer.
In early 1951, Watts moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the American Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco. Here he taught alongside Saburō Hasegawa (1906-1957), Frederic Spiegelberg, Haridas Chaudhuri, lama Tada Tōkan (1890-1967), and various visiting experts and professors. Hasegawa, in particular, served as a teacher to Watts in the areas of Japanese customs, arts, primitivism, and perceptions of nature. Besides teaching, Watts served for several years as the Academy's administrator. One notable student of his was Eugene Rose, who later went on to become a noted hieromonk and theologian in the Eastern Orthodox Church in America.
Watts also studied written Chinese and practiced Chinese brush calligraphy with Hasegawa as well as with some of the Chinese students who enrolled at the academy. While Watts was noted for an interest in Zen Buddhism, his reading and discussions delved into Vedanta, "the new physics", cybernetics, semantics, process philosophy, natural history, and the anthropology of sexuality.
After heading up the Academy for a few years, Watts left the faculty for a freelance career in the mid-1950s. In 1953, he began what became a long-running weekly radio program at Pacifica Radio station KPFA in Berkeley, which continued until his death in 1973. Like other volunteer programmers at the listener-sponsored station, Watts was not paid for his broadcasts; they did, however, gain him a large following in the San Francisco Bay Area. These programs were later carried by additional Pacifica stations, and were re-broadcast many times over in the decades following his death. The original tapes are currently held by the Pacifica Radio Archives, based at KPFK in Los Angeles, and at the Electronic University archive founded by his son, Mark Watts (alanwatts.org).
In 1957 when 42, Watts published one of his best known books, The Way of Zen, which focused on philosophical explication and history. Besides drawing on the lifestyle and philosophical background of Zen, in India and China, Watts introduced ideas drawn from general semantics (directly from the writings of Alfred Korzybski and also from Norbert Wiener's early work on cybernetics, which had recently been published). Watts offered analogies from cybernetic principles possibly applicable to the Zen life. The book sold well, eventually becoming a modern classic, and helped widen his lecture circuit.
In 1958, Watts toured parts of Europe with his father, meeting the renowned psychiatrist Carl Jung and the German psychotherapist Karlfried Graf Dürckheim.[15]
Upon returning to the United States, Watts recorded two seasons of a television series (1959–1960) for KQED public television in San Francisco, "Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life."[16]
In the 1960s, Watts began to experiment with psychedelics, initially with mescaline given to him by Dr. Oscar Janiger. He tried LSD several times with various research teams led by Drs. Keith S. Ditman (1921-2001), Sterling Bunnell, Jr., and Michael Agron. He also tried marijuana and concluded that it was a useful and interesting psychoactive drug that gave the impression of time slowing down. Watts's books of the '60s reveal the influence of these chemical adventures on his outlook. He later said about psychedelic drug use, "If you get the message, hang up the phone."[17]
For a time, Watts came to prefer writing in the language of modern science and psychology (Psychotherapy East and West is a good example), finding a parallel between mystical experiences and the theories of the material universe proposed by 20th-century physicists. He later equated mystical experience with ecological awareness, and typically emphasized whichever approach seemed best suited to the audience he was addressing.
Watts's explorations and teaching brought him into contact with many noted intellectuals, artists, and American teachers in the human potential movement. His friendship with poet Gary Snyder nurtured his sympathies with the budding environmental movement, to which Watts gave philosophical support. He also encountered Robert Anton Wilson, who credited Watts with being one of his "Light[s] along the Way" in the opening appreciation of Cosmic Trigger. Werner Erhard attended workshops given by Alan Watts and said of him, "He pointed me toward what I now call the distinction between Self and Mind. After my encounter with Alan, the context in which I was working shifted."[18]
Though never affiliated for long with any one academic institution, he did have a fellowship for several years at Harvard University. He also lectured to many college and university students. His lectures and books gave him far-reaching influence on the American intelligentsia of the 1950s–1970s, but he was often seen as an outsider in academia. When questioned sharply by students during his talk at University of California Santa Cruz in 1970, Watts responded that he was not an academic philosopher but rather "a philosophical entertainer".
Watts has been criticized by Buddhists such as Philip Kapleau and D. T. Suzuki for allegedly misinterpreting several key Zen Buddhist concepts. In particular, he drew criticism from those who believe that zazen must entail a strict and specific means of sitting, as opposed to a cultivated state of mind available at any moment in any situation. Typical of these is Kapleau's claim that Watts dismissed zazen on the basis of only half a koan.[19] In regard to the aforementioned koan, Robert Baker Aitken reports that Suzuki told him, "I regret to say that Mr. Watts did not understand that story."[20] In his talks, Watts addressed the issue of defining zazen practice when he said, "A cat sits until it is tired of sitting, then gets up, stretches, and walks away."
He also had his supporters in the Zen community, including Shunryu Suzuki, the founder of the San Francisco Zen Center. As David Chadwick recounted in his biography of Suzuki, Crooked Cucumber: the Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki, when a student of Suzuki's disparaged Watts by saying "we used to think he was profound until we found the real thing", Suzuki "fumed with a sudden intensity", saying, "You completely miss the point about Alan Watts! You should notice what he has done. He is a great bodhisattva."[21]
Watts sometimes alluded to a group of neighbors in Druid Heights (near Mill Valley, California) who had endeavored to combine architecture, gardening, and carpentry skills to make a beautiful and comfortable life for themselves. These neighbors accomplished this by relying on their own talents and using their own hands, as they lived in what has been called "shared bohemian poverty".[22] Druid Heights was founded by the writer Elsa Gidlow,[23] and Watts dedicated his book The Joyous Cosmology to the people of this neighborhood.[24]
Regarding his intentions, Watts attempted to lessen the alienation that accompanies the experience of being human that he felt plagued the modern Westerner, and (like his fellow British expatriate and friend, Aldous Huxley) to lessen the ill will that was an unintentional by-product of alienation from the natural world. He felt such teaching could improve the world, at least to a degree. He also articulated the possibilities for greater incorporation of aesthetics (for example: better architecture, more art, more fine cuisine) in American life. In his autobiography he wrote, "… cultural renewal comes about when highly differentiated cultures mix".[25]
In his last novel Island (1962), Aldous Huxley mentions the religious practice of maithuna as being something like what Roman Catholics call "coitus reservatus". A few years before, Alan Watts had discussed the theme in his own book Nature, Man and Woman. There, he discusses the possibility of the practice being known to early Christians and of it being kept secretly by the Church.
In his writings of the 1950s, he conveyed his admiration for the practicality in the historical achievements of Chán (Zen) in the Far East, for it had fostered farmers, architects, builders, folk physicians, artists, and administrators among the monks who had lived in the monasteries of its lineages. In his mature work, he presents himself as "Zennist" in spirit as he wrote in his last book, Tao: The Watercourse Way. Child rearing, the arts, cuisine, education, law and freedom, architecture, sexuality, and the uses and abuses of technology were all of great interest to him. Though known for his Zen teachings, he was also influenced by ancient Hindu scriptures, especially Vedanta, and spoke extensively about the nature of the divine Reality Man that Man misses, how the contradiction of opposites is the method of life and the means of cosmic and human evolution, how our fundamental Ignorance is rooted in the exclusive nature of mind and ego, how to come in touch with the Field of Consciousness and Light, and other cosmic principles. These are discussed in great detail in dozens of hours of audio that are in part captured in the 'Out of Your Mind' series.
Watts sought to resolve his feelings of alienation from the institutions of marriage and the values of American society, as revealed in his classic comments on love relationships in "Divine Madness" and on perception of the organism-environment in "The Philosophy of Nature". In looking at social issues he was quite concerned with the necessity for international peace, for tolerance and understanding among disparate cultures. He also came to feel acutely conscious of a growing ecological predicament; as one instance, in the early 1960s he wrote: "Can any melting or burning imaginable get rid of these ever-rising mountains of ruin—especially when the things we make and build are beginning to look more and more like rubbish even before they are thrown away?"[26] These concerns were later expressed in a television pilot made for NET filmed at his mountain retreat in 1971 in which he noted that the single track of conscious attention was wholly inadequate for interactions with a multi-tracked world.
He disliked much in the conventional idea of "progress". He hoped for change, but he preferred amiable, semi-isolated rural social enclaves, and also believed in tolerance for social misfits and eccentric artists. Watts decried the suburbanization of the countryside and the way of life that went with it. In one campus lecture tour, which Watts titled "The End to the Put-Down of Man", Watts presented positive images for both nature and humanity, spoke in favor of the various stages of human development (including the teenage years), reproached excessive cynicism and rivalry, and extolled intelligent creativity, good architecture and food.[citation needed]
Watts felt that absolute morality had nothing to do with the fundamental realization of one's deep spiritual identity. He advocated social rather than personal ethics. In his writings, Watts was increasingly concerned with ethics applied to relations between humanity and the natural environment and between governments and citizens. He wrote out of an appreciation of a racially and culturally diverse social landscape.
He often said that he wished to act as a bridge between the ancient and the modern, between East and West, and between culture and nature.
Watts led some tours for Westerners to the Buddhist temples of Japan. He also studied some movements from the traditional Chinese martial art T'ai chi ch'uan, with an Asian colleague, Al Chung-liang Huang.
In several of his later publications, especially Beyond Theology and The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are, Watts put forward a worldview, drawing on Hinduism, Chinese philosophy, panentheism, and modern science, in which he maintains that the whole universe consists of a cosmic self playing hide-and-seek (Lila), hiding from itself (Maya) by becoming all the living and non-living things in the universe, forgetting what it really is; the upshot being that we are all IT in disguise. In this worldview, Watts asserts that our conception of ourselves as an "ego in a bag of skin" is a myth; the entities we call the separate "things" are merely processes of the whole.
Watts's books frequently include discussions reflecting his keen interest in patterns that occur in nature and which are repeated in various ways and at a wide range of scales – including the patterns to be discerned in the history of civilizations.[27][28]
In October 1973, Watts returned from a European lecture tour to his cabin in Druid Heights. Friends of Watts had been concerned for him for some time over what they considered his excessive drinking of alcohol.[29] On 16 November 1973, he died in his sleep. He was reported to have been under treatment for a heart condition.[30] His body was cremated in a Buddhist ceremony shortly thereafter.[31]
Watts married three times and had seven children (five daughters and two sons). Watts' eldest daughters, Joan Watts and Anne Watts own and manage most of the copyrights to his books. His son, Mark Watts, currently serves as curator of his father's audio, video and film and has published content of some of his spoken lectures in print format. Watts met Eleanor Everett in 1936, when her mother, Ruth Fuller Everett, brought her to London to study piano. They met at the Buddhist Lodge, were engaged the following year and married in April 1938. A daughter, Joan, was born November 1938 and another, Anne, was born in 1942. Their marriage ended eleven years later, but Watts continued to correspond with his former mother-in-law.[32]
In 1950, Watts married Dorothy DeWitt and moved to San Francisco in early 1951 to teach. They began a family that grew to include five children: Tia, Mark, Richard, Lila, and Diane. The couple separated in the early sixties after Watts met Mary Jane Yates King while lecturing in New York. After a difficult divorce he married King in 1964. Watts lived with Mary Jane in Sausalito, California, in the mid-1960s.[33] He divided his later years between a houseboat in Sausalito called the Vallejo,[34] and a secluded cabin in Druid Heights, on the southwest flank of Mount Tamalpais north of San Francisco, California.

In recent years, portions of Watts' lectures have been popularized by a series of animated internet videos, purported to have been created in part by Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the creators of the animated series South Park (though there is no clear evidence of their involvement). This has spawned a culture of user-animated videos all around the net.[35]
Saybrook University offers the only course on Watts in the United States and perhaps the world (EHTP 3075: The Life and Work of Alan Watts) taught by Dr. Jeannine A. Davies. Saybrook also has the only Watts academic chair in the world, which is held by Dr. Stanley Krippner, Executive Faculty Member.[citation needed]
His talks inspired Van Morrison to write the song "Alan Watts Blues" for his album Poetic Champions Compose.
Samples from lectures by Alan Watts are featured in the intros or endings of several of STRFKR songs, including "Florida", "Isabella of Castile", "Medicine", "Pistol Pete", "Mystery Cloud", "Hungry Ghost" and "Quality Time". And the 2013 GoPro feature "Whale Fantasia" was viewed more than one million times in less than three months.[36]
Writer/director Spike Jonze re-introduces the spirit and "voice" of Watts in his 2013 film Her, where a futuristic, cyber version of Watts—an artificially intelligent operating system—is portrayed by Brian Cox.[37]

21 of 22 people found the following review helpfulA SOMETIMES SHOCKING BIOGRAPHY OF THE "SPIRITUAL ENTERTAINER"
Alan Wilson Watts (1915-1973) was a British-born philosopher, writer, and speaker, best known as a populariser of Eastern philosophy. He and his then-wife left England for America in 1938 on the eve of WWII, and he became an Episcopal priest---but he left the priesthood in 1950 and moved to California, where he became a cult figure in the Beat movement of the 1950s and later.Biographer Monica Furlong notes in this 1986 "authorized" (by the family) biography about critics of his first book (The Spirit of Zen - A Way of Life, Work and Art in the Far East (The Wisdom of the East)), "At his age, they wondered, what did he know of wisdom, of suffering, or mystical experience? Where was his apprenticeship to a guru, his initiation, his gradual growth into God-consciousness? Wisdom demanded that the disciple should work away faithfully until crisis-point or breakdown was reached... yet here was young Alan Watts claiming that you could get there without the agony... instead of making the long, painful journey by foot or camel. Who did he think he was?" (Pg. 75)Of his time as a priest, she observes, "it is difficult not to feel a twinge of cynicism about this scheme. A young man who has been Buddhist for the past ten years ... suddenly decides to become a Christian priest... because, to put it bluntly, it provides a convenient way of earning a living... knowing that he knows a great deal about religion, and that he is a natural speaker, singer, and theologian... he adds all of these considerations together and decides that switching religions may be the answer." (Pg. 78) She adds, "Watts's daughter Joan suggests another reason for Alan's 'conversion'.Read more ›
  I recently read both this bio and David Stuart's earlier bio of Watts. Furlong's book is a good read and has moments of wit. But overall I felt she was often unfair to this great man. A bit too much cynic and a bit too little examination of Watts' vast contributions to philosophy, spirituality and humanity's ongoing evolution.
  I have enjoyed reading Alan Watts' books and listening to his taped talks.  He is my favorite philosopher.  I was quite startled to learn that he had such an addictive personality.  He overused both nicotine and alcohol.  The fact that Alan Watts had substance abuse problems doesn't reflect on the wisdom of his teachings, but it does raise the question as to the value of these teachings to positively effect a person's life.  Obviously, these teachings did little to help Watts.  His early death at age 58 could be considered a deliberate suicide through the abuse of the legal drugs nicotine and alcohol.  The author may have sensationalized some parts of Watts' life, but I believe that his private excesses have been well documented elsewhere.

=======================================================
Alan Watts was born in London in January of 1915 at the start of the first World War. At a young age he became fascinated with the arts of the Far East, and by the time he was ten or eleven he began to read thriller stories by Sax Rohmer about about mysterious Oriental villains.  This interest led him in turn to the works of Lafcadio Hern, Christmas Humphreys, and DT Suzuki, and by fourteen was writing on Eastern themes, and was published in the Journal of the London Buddhist Lodge before producing his first booklet on Zen in 1932.  He moved to New York in 1938 and then to Chicago where he served as an Episcopal priest for six years before leaving the Church. In 1950 he moved to upstate New York, and in late 1950 visited with Joseph Campbell and, composer John Cage, and Luisa Commaraswamy at his Millbrook farmhouse.  Then in 1951 at the invitation of Frederic Spiegelberg he moved to San Francisco to teach at the Academy of Asian Studies. 
Alan Watts was profoundly influenced by the East Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Buddhism, and by Taoist thought, which is reflected in Zen poetry and the arts of China and Japan.  After leaving the Church he never became a member of  another organized religion, although he wrote and spoke extensively about Zen Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoisim.  Some American Buddhists criticized him for not sitting regularly in zazen, even though he recorded several guided meditations teaching a variety of mediation techniques. Alan Watts responded simply by saying: “A cat sits until it is done sitting, and then gets up, stretches, and walks away.”
After teaching at the Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco he became Dean, and began to give regular radio talks on KPFA, the Berkeley free radio station. In 1957 he published his bestselling Way of Zen, and in 1958 returned to Europe where he met with CG Jung. He was an early subject in pioneering psychedelic trials, and after recording two seasons of the public television series “Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life” traveled to Japan several times in the early sixties. By the late sixties he had become a counter culture celebrity, and traveled widely to speak at universities and growth centers across the US and Europe.
By the early seventies Alan Watts had become a foremost interpreter of Eastern thought for the West, and was widely published in periodicals including Earth, Elle, Playboy, and Redbook. He appeared on CBS television’s Camera Three in 1969, and in 1971 he recorded a pilot for a new  show titled “A Conversation with Myself” for NET, the precursor to PBS.  When the series was not produced he recorded the shows  in 1972 with his son Mark and his long-time audio archivist Henry Jacobs.  Overall Alan Watts developed an extensive audio library of nearly 400 talks and wrote more than 25  books during his lifetime, including his final volume, Tao; the Watercourse Way.  Alan died in his sleep in November of 1973 after returning from an intensive international lecture tour. A film on his life and works is currently in production.

=======================================================
                    Anyone know what Alan Watts died of.   He seemed to have died at a young age but I cant find any info on this...Can anyone help?
            slightly or possibly related: is it true he was an alcoholic?  i've heard this from various sources (travelling around giving lectures, he had to attend many many wine parties).
He writes of alcohol and his relationship to alcohol in a number of his works, including his autobiography.  He harbors no guilty or shame in often enjoying and inebrieted state - in fact, he writes about how the guilt that Western Civ. people associate with drinking might be related to why we associate the term "alcoholic" with the image of a "problem drinker."  I..e., What does it mean to be an alcoholic?   Does it have a pejorative connotation?  Well, perhaps that is simply cultural.  He points out, for example, how Japanese people (in his time and before) might drink quite heavily (yes, even Zen masters) and would be considered clinical "alcoholics," but they were "happy" drunks  - always pleasant beautiful people.
            Sorry...he was playing with a balloon the night of his passing - alledgedly remarking on lightness of the balloon (from memory - source Chungliang Huang's preface to "Tao and the Watercourse Way")
            Interesting......certainly ther must be more to this.....I guess I must go on investigating....lol
            definitely an alcoholic - he would often times show up drunk at talks, but would still give insightful words of wisdom. He also had many family problems, ignored his children, cheated on his first wife, etc. 
NEVERTHELESS, his words are magic, so what are we to take from it all? the words and not the man? the whole package?
            i personally feel i am in error to expect my teachers to be perfect in relation to a given value system.  
if a person expects his or her teacher to be perfect, it seems to me that that person should ask, why?
alan watts often discussed the hang-up of trying to segregate the profane from the holy or spiritual, and i can recall at least one discussion where he addresses, specifically, the common mistake of expecting a spiritual guide to be free of what some might perceive as personal taint. 
            Neruda said... if I was to live again, I would make more mistakes.  when I die I won`t regret about the things I did but about things I did not do.  
A wise man with a perfectly straight "no mistakes commited" life?... Standing only on the "good", stablished by society, side???...
            I mean, he was understanding how our society was going the wrong way.  How wrong we had been educated from the beginning, and the futile significance of our most elementary concepts, like time.  
He had been also educated in this wrong society with this wrong concepts, and he used substances in order to brake trough some of the limitations of the own perception that had been generated by the alienation of occidentalism...
He travelled into himself as he studied the most acient philosophies of the world, like induism and buddhism.  He gave the best of himself as much as he could in order to try and help others understand this situation of human kind.  
He had to deal with himself, he was human, and he was an enigma as everything that is real in this universe.
The fact that you can be a great teacher, or a great person does not mean you will never be in chaos.  Specially when you live in a world which is not ready to comprehend it´s own chaos...  And the fact of your own dark side intensifies that experience.
            Alcoholism isn't about how much or how often one drinks, methinks, but rather the power it has over ones life.  If a drug becomes necessary for functionality, or interrupts or replaces the enjoyment of other aspects of life, then it can be a negative.  
watts himself probably would not have been comfortable being considered a spiritual leader in any case. he was really just a rather enlightened dude. 
that said, it does bother me that he was said to have not been the best to his wife (this thread not the first time i've read that), moreso than any perceived alcoholism. one would naturally expect from the man a lot of respect for his wife -- has anyone read his bit about making love? he seemed ahead of his time, really. he was into non-thrusting.
anyhow, does anyone know more about his relationship and his general goodness of character? all i've read is hearsay from the net.
            I love Alan Watts, but I would not call him enlightened, for that would compare him to the Buddha, who created the 4 noble truths, where alan watts just refined them for us so that we could get a better understanding of what they ment.
            There is no way for me to verify that, and no need to, because either way, Alan Watts showed reverance for the four noble truths and he himself never claimed to be a Buddha. 
Im just pointing out that Alan Watts would not fit the criteria of enlightened, defined by the culture from which the word was derived from.
            "he writes about how the guilt that Western Civ. people associate with drinking might be related to why we associate the term "alcoholic" with the image of a "problem drinker.""
            alan had no problem with suicide. he asked in fact if it was'nt the most sane to do in an insane world? but you would have to consider this world as being insane to make such an effort.
            Happy to stumble across this thread.  I too have been wondering about the nature of Alan's passing.  Has anyone though to ask Mark Watts?  I do recall in one of his lectures, (paraphrase) Better to live a short life doing what you enjoy doing then a long life doing what you don't.  
            First of all, i am glad to see that there are other people out there as interested in Alan Watts as i am.  In fact, you guys seem to be more connected.  Nevertheless, isn't it possible that Alan Watts demise was his own choice?  I mean, perhaps he just decided, as his daughter Joan put it in the Monica Furlong's biography, to "check out."  He was ready to let go of his current journey so that a new one could begin.  I am not suggesting that he committed suicide, but he just decided that he had enough and it was time to go.  The cause of death was labeled as "heart failure."  That being said, i am sure alcohol may have had some contribution.   
I bring this up as it occurred to me about out-of-body-type experiences, where a person had the feeling of rising out of his/her body and floating above, and that person's spirit/soul/whatever was "attached," if you will, by a thread of some kind to his/her body.   I had read that you were able to return to your body because of that connection; however, if you severed that connection, your body would die, and your spirit/soul/whatever would float away.  
            As a recovering alcoholic, I knew immediately that Allan Watts' death was from alcoholism. I had suspected this for years. I spoke briefly to his son once when ordering material from MEA in Olima, CA and asked that rather bold question. He stated that Allan had been depressed about a specific event he attended and disillusioned with the response he received. He then made no other specific claim about his dying. Even when hearing his talks, his hacking cough and throaty laugh, one could suss this out.
I happen to fall in line with the group that finds an alcoholic death at the age of 58 a tragedy, not unlike any other disease laden death that takes someone we love from us. Alcoholism is particularly tragic in that its effects on the entire family are so devastating. There is nothing "cool" in dying from this horrible disease.
Allan was a great philosopher and teacher. In the realm of the alcoholic world, however, he was just another drunk.
            Say what you want, but all you are doing is "classifying Alan Wattsas just another drunk or teacher etc" with words which really are never what anything ever "is" so really it's just noise.
            Yes Anthony what you say is, harsh, but true. But then one has to consider that if Alan was not troubled by substance abuse would he ever have sought out a path to truth. If we settle for a mindane trouble free life then we settle and that is it. But bring me the troubled heart and I will show you a seeker, a fellow walker of the path of truth.
            I like what you say and it fits with my experience. i am just beginning to trust in the universe and hold onto myself a bit less tightly
            My definition of an "alcoholic" would be somebody who is dependant on alcohol for happiness, or in other words addicted and can't stop.
            But we know that Alan Watts was a very intelligent guy who understood Zen Buddhism, and when you understand that, you aren't really dependant on anything for happiness.  I think, he drank for excitement.  Like he says, "If things weren't constantly changing, this world would be a collosal bore."
            If you read his biography, it seems like Alan died from stress and alcoholism. His death, if we can call it that, is somewhat shrouded in mystery and legend. According to Jano, his wife at the time, Alan was experimenting with advanced breathing techniques around the time of his death. Jano believes that Alan was successful in liberating "himself" from his body. 
Before he died, Alan talked about how reincarnation was a perfectly logical belief. He told his daughter Joan that after he died, he would come back as Joan's daughter, a beautiful redhead. Joan conceived shortly after Alan's death and gave birth to a redheaded child named Laura, who seemed to display some of Alan's signature moves. At a young age, she accompanied her mother Joan to one of Joan's friend's house. Laura walked up to a cupboard where liquor was kept, reached into the back and pulled out a handle of vodka. 
            I had a very long phone conversation with Alan's daughter shortly after he died.   She spoke fondly of his suggestion about returning though now in 2009, her red haired daughter would be over 30.  
 Ironically I am now the same age as he was at his death, but at that time I was only 23 and having followed his career closely for several years, wondered out loud about a conspiracy to be rid of him because of his late forays into the politics of that time.   I remember he had been scheduled to speak in Germany at an Army intelligence base shortly before his death and had also spoken (while the war in Vietnam was still an issue and he was quite vocal about that too, participating in benefits for North Vietnamese schools or hospitals, but also supporting Tibet against China, as i recall).  Most pointedly, he spoke to more than one military group (i recall he was invited to speak more than once he never held back in his strong opinions) and he wrote some very powerful articles and essays, some collected in the book, Does It Matter, the essay on money being the most relevant today.   In this book he said that if the USA still exists as a separate and distinct entity by the year 2000, we are all in big trouble.  Although it isclear his health was not good at all at this time, I also remember very clearly seeing a young Senator (during the Watergate hearings of the same period) from Connecticut, Lowell Weicker, then on the Senate Watergate Committee, televised daily.  I remember clearly watching him hold up a futuristic dart gun that he described as capable of shooting tiny thin needles from a great distance that would carry a tiny amount of caryfish serum extract capable of causing heart failure from a distance with no trace of the thin puncture or the poison in the bloodstream.   He explained that there were gallons of this serum in Langley, Virginia headquarters of the CIA, contrary to treaties about biological warfare.   This is what led me to wonder, in the face of some radical political statements and standpoints by Alan Watts, if there was not some kind of mischief in his death, not forgeting this was not long after the suspicious deaths of MLK Jr., RFK, and other counter culture heroes, and not long before John Lennon was shot in a fashion much like RFK, in the open but by a suspicously programmable person.   His poor health and drinking convince us it was a natural failure of his health, and it could well be that is all it was.
            I think it's great the Respect shown here for Alan. This is a 'touchy' subject so it is appreciated. 
            I contacted Mark Watts about the death of his father and he gave me a cock-and-bull story about a "jealous philosopher whom we suspect may have poisoned " the famous teacher.  I wrote back that he shouldn't try to inject melodrama or legend into his passing-- look what happened to Jesus.  Some sources list "heart failure" as the cause of death but this is only the immediate reason his heart stopped, similar to listing "pneumonia" or "organ failure" as cause of death-- when there is a more fundamental underlying cause such as cancer.  I saw some pictures of him in his Playboy magzine interview back in in '73 and was shocked at his emaciated condition-- he was unrecognizable as the crew-cut young man pictured on my copy of The Book (on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are)-- in fact he looked like nothing so much as a wizened, whispy-bearded oriental, so whatever was wrong with him didn't ahppenn suddenly.  Everyone always brings up alcoholism-- and he may have drunk excessively (he played host to a multitude of dinner guests almost every night and was very gregarious I have read), but it is most likely that a combination of cigarette smoking and heavy drinking led to a heart attack.  For a guy who was so spiritually well-adjusted he sure burned out early.  Maybe our attempts to attain every greater longevity only represent  another vain desire.
            For years I was under the impression that Alan Watts had committed suicide.  I had originally heard that he was suffering from physical problems, at least partially related to pain from an (automobil?) accident.  I recently mentioned my belief to a friend, who was surprised she had never heard it, and now looking on the net I see nothing about it.  Does anyone out there know the facts?  Regardless, it must be acknowledged that this man was a valuable contributor to western buddhism and that the nature of his death in no way could detract from the beauty of his life.
            I guess some of our interest in this question might be a bit obscene but somewhat reasonable.
Most of us only know Alan Watts thru his written work and talks, so all we can apreciate from his legacy remains in the world of ideas. 
I think part of the interest in the question comes from the more or less conscious fear of following his thesis only to achieve no better results in our lives than those adquired following a "system"; rock and roll, fascism, catholicism, existentialism...
AKA "am I gonna do all that contemplation to end up taking prozac and booze just like my friend the hedonist?" syndrome
            At a certain stage of the game (of Life) we all have to come to terms with our strengths and weaknesses. Acceptance of their reality being the first order of business, how we're going to relate to them being the next. I started drinking when I was 16. I decided it would be to my advantage, (if I were to get clear in my relationship to it) to stop when I was 51. Altered states of consciousness have been part and parcel of my personal development in regards to my philosophy of life. I think it's this way with most people. How you choose to alter it is a constantly evolving thing. Best case scenario -  The choices you make don't open you to the possibility of addiction. Even then, it does not negate all that you've learned along the way. From where I stand, Alan Watts was a fine teacher of life, and it's pitfalls. The most meaningful criteria regarding my propensity to alter my consciouness is now: #1. Is it sustainable? #2. Does it demonstrate a deep reverence for life? In Alan's case it seems #1. it was - until it wasn't. #2. He was conscious of, and at One with his life choices. To me, he was (and is) a kindred spirit for no other reason than he wasn't divided against himself, as far as I can tell. What is living an authentic life, and leaving an authentic legacy, if not that?
            Alan Watts may not have  been enlightened like Siddhartha Gautama became, but he was an enlightened man.  Enlightened or not, he was still a man and, therefore, subject to human frailties.   One thing I've noticed in my life's journeys is that moths who explore light bulbs too closely get burned.  In the Bible when Moses went on the mountaintop, he was afraid to look at the burning bush, face of God.  I think most people would be.  Facing reality, facing truth, has consequences many would prefer not to face.  Alan Watts faced these realities and accepted the consequences.  As a "mere" human, however, the consequences had impact.  If it was alcoholism, this did not negate his knowledge, his experiences nor his ability to teach what he has learned.
            The question that one ponders, is why he drank? If the truth can be known, one would  say it can be painful to bear its reality. For you are alone, as Alan Watts realized his aloneness, for even as these apparitions appear to his senses, he was alone. How to bear the reality of such a truth? For what you call the world, is yourself, playing withitself. Yourself speaking to yourself, for when you speak to another, the utterance is your very echo. Those you call friends, are the imagninations of your dreams. Unreal,  your whole life is illusion, there is no one there, like the shadows of memories that live there existence. I ponder if these words, are really being read, or if there is a reader, who is reading them. For when it is sent, how do i know it is going nowhere.  
            You may also listen to his son, Mark Watts in a phone interview he gave awhile back speaking about his father: 
Mark is in charge of the huge volume of audio tapes, archive of writing and even videos of his father at his website:
This discussion reminds me of a discourse by AWW on the tendency in our culture to segregate the spiritual from the everyday. So that, when we build up a hero of sorts, we are shocked to find out that he's not a saint, after all. Alan Watts enjoyed his humanity very much (women and wine included) and was or that reason no less spiritual. The integration of these two elements in a human being--Saint and Sinner--largely makes up what we regard as enlightenment :)
            ...just came across a corresponding quote in In My Own Way. Speaking of a Zen master named Sokei-an with whom he studied, "if I have over stressed the wayward elements of [his] personality, it is only because I have felt that he was basically in the same team as I; that he bridged the spiritual and the earthy, and that he was as humorously earthy as he was spiritually awakened."
            Being aware of and making use of one's  higher consciousness and cognitive ability  is like a man of no experience and education winning millions of pounds with the lottery, wisdom does not come automatically on how he should spend his winnings.
            We are simply stated the universe experiencing itself in this particular way, no more or no less signifigant than the infinite space between the galaxies or any other facet of it.  Alan's death was by his choice - his bodhisattva day's completed.  We all understand the nothing and the something as one.  To cling to any one aspect of it is to miss the main course and eat the menu instead, as Alan has brilliantly pointed out.  Peace and serenity to all through logic and common sense was Alan's message from the Buddha to us.  
            When touching on the subject of death i don't think it would be necessary to look upon it in a bad light.. Alan would have never wanted people thinking 'OH HOW TERRIBLE ALAN WAS POISONED' or 'OH HE WAS A TERRIBLE ALCOHOLIC'.. who is this person you're talking about being something? is it this Alan Watts? truly and deeply I feel he already knew the here and now is eternal and always changing, and death is just as much a part of it as anything else...... huge respect for Alan and the people in this forum keeping the way alive :)  
            . Alan was my adopted grandfather.. My mother was his personal assistant at ucsf when he was teaching there. And when My parents married in the 50s, Alan gave my mother away, for she had already lost her father. So I always new him as grandpa alan. We saw him all the time at our house, or house parties. in the richmond district in sf. HE scared me with his huge laugh at times for I was very young in the sixties. He named his boat after my mother..  He did drink, but  a happy drinker he was. My mother always said ,," He was too much for the world to handle. Too smart.. Too wise.
Mom never recovered from his loss, and always shared his teachings with me untill the day she died a few years ago.

Alan Watt is a long-term researcher into the causative forces behind major changes in historical development.  
His background is that of a renaissance man with a background in three professions, plus having various books published in religions, philosophy, poetry, mainly under pseudonyms.  
For much of his life (for main income) he was heavily involved in the music industry as a singer/songwriter/performer involved in folk music, blues, pop, rock, and even classical.  
Also known for his session guitar work, he has played with some of the most well-known artists and groups.
Born in Scotland, he watched the subtleties of politics and media as they guided the population of the U.K. covertly into a European Amalgamation.  
He has been warning the North American people for some years now that the same process of amalgamation is being carried out. 
With historical documentation, he shows how cultures are created and altered by those in control, always to lead the people like sheep into the next pasture.

Alan Wilson Watts (1915-1973) was a naturalized American author and lecturer who interpreted Zen to the West. His writings were particularly popular among the so-called "beat generation" of the late 1950s and early 1960s.Alan Wilson Watts was born in Chislehurst, England, on January 6, 1915. Raised in the county of Kent, his introduction to Eastern culture came at about the age of 11 when he read the novels of Sax Rohmer and Edgar Wallace about Fu Manchu, the inscrutable Chinese detective, "and other sophisticated Chinese villains." Watts received his secondary education at King's School, Canterbury, where he did some creative writing and participated in fencing, rowing, and debate.He worked in his father's office from 1932 to 1939 while serving as a council member and member of the executive committee of the World Congress of Faiths in London. He read Bergson, Nietzche, Havelock Ellis, Jung, Bernard Shaw, and Eastern texts through the understandings of modern interpreters such as Swami Vivekananda, D. T. Suzuki, and Madame Blavatsky. In 1934 a Theosophical Society member introduced him to a Yugoslavian mystic, Dmitrije Mitrinovic, with whom he identified. From 1934 to 1938 he edited the Buddhist Lodge of London's journal, The Middle Way, and his first book, The Spirit of Zen, appeared in 1936.Watts came to the United States in 1939 and was naturalized in 1943. Upon arrival in New York he studied under a local Zen master, Sokei-an Sasaki. But, believing that Christianity could be understood as a form of a mystical and perennial philosophy, he affiliated with the Episcopal Church. He received his Master of Sacred Theology degree from Seabury-Western Theological Seminary in Evanston, Illinois, in June 1948 and was given an honorary Doctor of Divinity from the University of Vermont in 1958. Ordained an Episcopal priest, he served from 1944 until 1950 as Episcopal chaplain at Northwestern University. He then left the church. In an interview in LIFE magazine in 1961 Watts said that he left the church "not because it doesn't practice what it preaches, but because it preaches."Watts returned to his early interest in Eastern thought. He sought to apply its principles to modern psychology in The Meaning of Happiness (1940). Among other writings in which he argued for a common mystical core underlying all religions, reflecting the influence of Aldous Huxley, a major attempt to reconcile Christianity and Eastern thought was Myth and Ritual in Christianity (1953). In 1964 in Beyond Theology he argued that they were in fact incompatible: "My previous discussions did not take proper account of that whole aspect of Christianity which is uncompromising, ornery, militant, rigorous, imperious, and invincibly self-righteous."From 1951 to 1957 Watts taught comparative philosophy and psychology at the new American Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco, which became a graduate school of the College of the Pacific, and served as its dean from 1953 to 1956. Feeling as out of place in academy as he did in the church, he retired to a career of writing and lecturing. In 1959-1961 he was director and writer of the National Educational Television series Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life.He was married three times - to Eleanor Everett (1938; divorced 1950); to Dorothy DeWitt (1950; divorced 1963); and to Mary Jane Yates King (1963) - and had seven children. He described himself as "an unrepented sensualist, an immoderate lover of women and the delights of sexuality, " as well as of fine food, drink, tobacco, clothes, books, and jewelry and of nature. From 1957 until his death on November 16, 1973, he continued to write and lecture at colleges, universities, medical schools, and mental health institutions in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia, including Harvard; Yale; Cambridge; the Universities of Chicago, Michigan, Indiana, and Hawaii; and the C. J. Jung Institute (Zurich).Although his thought is associated with Rinzai Zen Buddhism, Watts did not wish to identify himself with any religious group, "on the ground that partisanship in religion closes the mind." He once called himself a spiritual "entertainer." His own mystical idealism, however, was more an amalgamation of ideas than traditional Zen, for he also borrowed from the Taoist philosophy of Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzu and the Advaita Vedanta of Shankara, treating all Eastern thought monolithically and interpreting it in modern terms.Watts believed that the key to the universe is fundamentally a higher consciousness or mind. The world is an emanation of the one Being or Consciousness. Unity is the nature of the universe while the distinctions between knowing subject and the objects of knowledge are actually expressions of unity. This fact, he said, is gaining support from the discoveries of science, such as those of the British biologist Joseph Needham, in whose work he was especially interested. The human predicament is the mistaken belief in the individual ego and the forms of activity which result. This places the individual in conflict with all of reality and results in the ego feeling ultimately responsible. Christianity in all its forms, Watts said, has reinforced this delusion, while Chinese and Indian thinkers have discovered the unity of the depths of the human being and the One which makes one "at home in the world." Watts even criticized the applications of Zen by the "beat generation" of the 1950s and traditional Japanese Zen schools as egoconscious.True Zen, he said, was not that of the "solemn and sexless ascetic, " but the liberation of the mind from traditional thought forms to raise human consciousness to identify with the Consciousness which is Reality. It is essentially a mystical experience of Reality "felt directly in a silence of words and meanings." Mystical thinkers of all traditions have discovered this, he said, and modern psychotherapy is coming to agree. In Psychotherapy East and West (1961) Watts referred to Carl Jung, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, Norman O. Brown, Abraham Maslow, and others as those who were bringing science closer to Eastern insight.Further ReadingIn My Own Way (1972), Watt's autobiography, is the best place to begin. Among his scores of works, his most systematic attempt to present his thought and relate it to Christianity is Beyond Theology (1964). Psychology East and West (1961) exhibits his attempt to harmonize his thought with psychotherapy. A full-length critical study of Watts is David Clark, The Pantheism of Alan Watts (1978).Additional SourcesBrannigan, Michael C., Everywhere and nowhere: the path of Alan Watts, New York: P. Lang, 1988.Furlong, Monica, Zen effects: the life of Alan Watts, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1986.Stuart, David, Alan Watts, New York: Stein and Day, 1983, 1976. 
Eclectic British thinker and writer who relocated to California and played a central part in the counter-culture of the 1960s. Watts became a leading light in the Human Potential Movement and was affiliated to the Esalen Institute. Although he had no academic background in eastern religions and no knowledge of oriental languages, his elegant writings caught the popular imagination and enjoyed considerable success. His books The Way of Zen (1957) and Psychotherapy East and West (1961) offered a way of personal growth based on Eastern psychology as an alternative to what many regard as the egocentric hedonism of Western culture.
British-born American philosopher, teacher of Zen Buddhism, and pioneer popularizer of Eastern philosophy in the United States. Watts was born January 6, 1915, in Chislehurst, Kent, England. He came to the United States in 1938, and he was naturalized in 1943. The same year he moved to the United States he married the daughter of Ruth Fuller Everett (who was involved with the First Zen Institute of America). Even as a youth he had been interested in Eastern religions in general and Zen Buddhism in particular. However, Watts studied for the priesthood and after completing his course at Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, he was ordained in the Episcopal Church in 1944. He remained in Evanston, Illinois, and pursued a master of sacred theology degree (1948) at Seabury while serving as a chaplain at Northwestern University (adja-cent to the Seabury campus) for six years (1944-50).In 1950 Watts divorced, resigned from the priesthood, and entered a year of seclusion. In 1951 he moved to California as an instructor at the American Academy of Asian Studies (1951-57). He gained some degree of fame in 1957 with the positive response to his book, The Way of Zen (1957), which became a book introducing Zen to a public eager for Eastern wisdom. Over the next fifteen years he wrote numerous books presenting his personal appropriation of Buddhism. As a lecturer, from 1956 onward he traveled to universities across the continent. He directed the Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life series on station KQED, San Francisco (1959-60).In 1962 some of those who had gathered around him as students founded the Society for Comparative Philosophy as a vehicle for his teaching. He died November 16, 1973.Sources:Melton, J. Gordon. Religious Leaders of America. Detroit: Gale Research, 1991.Stuart, David. Alan Watts. Radnor, Pa.: Chilton Book, 1976.Watts, Alan.

Alan Watts was an intellectual and a popular interpreter of Eastern philosophies who came to prominence during the 1960s. The author of such works as The Way of Zen and Nature, Man and Woman, and The Book On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are, Watts recorded with Warner Bros. in 1967. The album is an introduction to Hindu thoughts and tradition, backed by drone rock performed on traditional Indian instruments. Watts was born in England in 1915 and published his first essay at 16 or the Journal of the Buddhist Lodge of London. He came to the United States in 1938 and became the Episcopal chaplain at Northwestern University during World War II. Watts went on to become dean of the American Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco and made the public television series Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life. The sage cultivated an audience of millions through more than two dozen books along with lectures, recordings, and countless radio and TV appearances. Watts saw the problem of modern man as his alienation from his fellow man, and tried to mend it as a consultant for psychiatric institutions and hospitals and even the United States Air Force. He spent the mid-'60s traveling through Asia with his students. He died in California in 1973. ~ Ron DePasquale, Rovi

Alan Wilson Watts (6 January 1915 – 16 November 1973) was a British-born philosopher, writer, and speaker, best known as an interpreter and populariser of Eastern philosophy for a Western audience. Born in Chislehurst, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began Zen training in New York. Pursuing a career, he attended Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, where he received a master's degree in theology. Watts became an Episcopal priest but left the ministry in 1950 and moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the American Academy of Asian Studies.
Living on the West Coast, Watts gained a large following in the San Francisco Bay Area while working as a volunteer programmer at KPFA, a Pacifica Radio station in Berkeley. Watts wrote more than 25 books and articles on subjects important to Eastern and Western religion, introducing the then-burgeoning youth culture to The Way of Zen (1957), one of the first bestselling books on Buddhism. In Psychotherapy East and West (1961), Watts proposed that Buddhism could be thought of as a form of psychotherapy and not a religion. He also explored human consciousness, in the essay "The New Alchemy" (1958), and in the book The Joyous Cosmology (1962).
Towards the end of his life, he divided his time between a houseboat in Sausalito and a cabin on Mount Tamalpais. His legacy has been kept alive by his son, Mark Watts, and by many of his recorded talks and lectures that have found new life on the Internet. According to the critic Erik Davis, his "writings and recorded talks still shimmer with a profound and galvanizing lucidity."[3]
Watts was born to middle class parents in the village of Chislehurst, Kent (now south-east London), in 1915, living at 3 (now 5) Holbrook Lane. His father was a representative for the London office of the Michelin Tyre Company, his mother a housewife whose father had been a missionary. With modest financial means, they chose to live in pastoral surroundings and Alan, an only child, grew up playing at brookside, learning the names of wildflowers and butterflies.[4] Probably because of the influence of his mother’s religious family[5] the Buchans, an interest in "ultimate things" seeped in. But it mixed with Alan’s own interests in storybook fables and romantic tales of the mysterious Far East.[6]
Watts also later wrote of a mystical vision he experienced while ill with a fever as a child. During this time he was influenced by Far Eastern landscape paintings and embroideries that had been given to his mother by missionaries returning from China. The few Chinese paintings Watts was able to see in England riveted him, and he wrote "I was aesthetically fascinated with a certain clarity, transparency, and spaciousness in Chinese and Japanese art. It seemed to float...".[7] These works of art emphasized the participative relationship of man in nature, a theme that stood fast throughout his life, and one that he often writes about. See, for instance, the last chapter in The Way of Zen.[8]
By his own assessment, Watts was imaginative, headstrong, and talkative. He was sent to boarding schools (which included both academic and religious training of the Muscular Christianity sort) from early years. Of this religious training, he remarked "Throughout my schooling my religious indoctrination was grim and maudlin…"[9] During holidays in his teen years, Francis Croshaw, a wealthy Epicurean with strong interests in both Buddhism and the exotic little-known aspects of European culture, took Watts on a trip through France. It was not long afterward that Watts felt forced to decide between the Anglican Christianity he had been exposed to and the Buddhism he had read about in various libraries, including Croshaw’s. He chose Buddhism, and sought membership in the London Buddhist Lodge, which had been established by Theosophists, and was now run by the barrister Christmas Humphreys. Watts became the organization’s secretary at 16 (1931). The young Watts explored several styles of meditation during these years.
Watts attended The King's School, Canterbury next door to Canterbury Cathedral. Though he was frequently at the top of his classes scholastically, and was given responsibilities at school, he botched an opportunity for a scholarship to Oxford by styling a crucial examination essay in a way that was read as presumptuous and capricious.[10]
Hence, when he graduated from secondary school, Watts was thrust into the world of employment, working in a printing house and later a bank. He spent his spare time involved with the Buddhist Lodge and also under the tutelage of a "rascal guru" named Dimitrije Mitrinović. (Mitrinović was himself influenced by Peter Demianovich Ouspensky, G. I. Gurdjieff, and the varied psychoanalytical schools of Freud, Jung and Adler.) Watts also read widely in philosophy, history, psychology, psychiatry and Eastern wisdom. By his own reckoning, and also by that of his biographer Monica Furlong, Watts was primarily an autodidact. His involvement with the Buddhist Lodge in London afforded Watts a considerable number of opportunities for personal growth. Through Humphreys, he contacted eminent spiritual authors (e.g., Nicholas Roerich [an artist, scholar, and mystic], Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan) and prominent theosophists like Alice Bailey. In 1936, aged 21, he attended the World Congress of Faiths at the University of London, heard D. T. Suzuki read a paper, and afterwards was able to meet this esteemed scholar of Zen Buddhism.[11] Beyond these discussions and personal encounters, Watts absorbed, by studying the available scholarly literature, the fundamental concepts and terminology of the main philosophies of India and East Asia.
In 1936, Watts' first book was published, The Spirit of Zen. In The Way of Zen[12] he disparaged The Spirit of Zen as a "popularisation of Suzuki's earlier works, and besides being very unscholarly it is in many respects out of date and misleading."
In 1938 he and his bride left England to live in America. He had married Eleanor Everett, whose mother Ruth Fuller Everett was involved with a traditional Zen Buddhist circle in New York. A few years later, Ruth Fuller married the Zen master (or "roshi"), Sokei-an Sasaki, and this Japanese gentleman served as a sort of model and mentor to Watts, though he chose not to enter into a formal Zen training relationship with Sasaki. During these years, according to his later writings, Watts had another mystical experience while on a walk with his wife.
Watts' fascination with the Zen (or Chan) tradition—beginning during the 1930s—developed because that tradition embodied the spiritual, interwoven with the practical, as exemplified in the subtitle of his Spirit of Zen: A Way of Life, Work, and Art in the Far East. "Work," "life," and "art" were not demoted due to a spiritual focus. In his writing, he referred to it as "the great Ch’an (or Zen) synthesis of Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism after A.D. 700 in China."[13]
Watts left formal Zen training in New York because the method of the teacher did not suit him. He was not ordained as a Zen monk, but he felt a need to find a professional outlet for his philosophical inclinations. He entered Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, an Episcopal (Anglican) school in Evanston, Illinois, where he studied Christian scriptures, theology, and church history. He attempted to work out a blend of contemporary Christian worship, mystical Christianity, and Asian philosophy. Watts was awarded a master's degree in theology in response to his thesis, which he published as a popular edition under the title Behold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity of Mystical Religion. The pattern was set, in that Watts did not hide his dislike for religious outlooks that he decided were dour, guilt-ridden, or militantly proselytizing—no matter if they were found within Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, or Buddhism.
All seemed to go reasonably well in his next role, as Episcopal priest (beginning in 1945, aged 30), until an extramarital affair resulted in his young wife having their marriage annulled. It also resulted in Watts leaving the ministry by 1950. He spent the New Year getting to know Joseph Campbell; his wife, Jean Erdman; and John Cage.
In early 1951, Watts moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the American Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco. Here he taught alongside Saburō Hasegawa, Frederic Spiegelberg, Haridas Chaudhuri, lama Tokwan Tada, and various visiting experts and professors. Hasegawa, in particular, served as a teacher to Watts in the areas of Japanese customs, arts, primitivism, and perceptions of nature. Besides teaching, Watts served for several years as the Academy's administrator. One notable student of his was Eugene Rose, who later went on to become a noted hieromonk and theologian in the Eastern Orthodox Church in America.
Watts also studied written Chinese and practiced Chinese brush calligraphy with Hasegawa as well as with some of the Chinese students who enrolled at the academy. While Watts was noted for an interest in Zen Buddhism, his reading and discussions delved into Vedanta, "the new physics", cybernetics, semantics, process philosophy, natural history, and the anthropology of sexuality.
After heading up the Academy for a few years, Watts left the faculty for a freelance career in the mid-1950s. In 1953, he began what became a long-running weekly radio program at Pacifica Radio station KPFA in Berkeley, which continued until his death in 1973. Like other volunteer programmers at the listener-sponsored station, Watts was not paid for his broadcasts; they did, however, gain him a large following in the San Francisco Bay Area. These programs were later carried by additional Pacifica stations, and were re-broadcast many times over in the decades following his death. The original tapes are currently held by the Pacifica Radio Archives, based at KPFK in Los Angeles, and at the Electronic University archive founded by his son, Mark Watts (alanwatts.org).
In 1957 when 42, Watts published one of his best known books, The Way of Zen, which focused on philosophical explication and history. Besides drawing on the lifestyle and philosophical background of Zen, in India and China, Watts introduced ideas drawn from general semantics (directly from the writings of Alfred Korzybski and also from Norbert Wiener's early work on cybernetics, which had recently been published). Watts offered analogies from cybernetic principles possibly applicable to the Zen life. The book sold well, eventually becoming a modern classic, and helped widen his lecture circuit.
In 1958, Watts toured parts of Europe with his father, meeting the renowned psychiatrist Carl Jung. In relation to modern psychology, Watts's instincts were closer to Jung's or Abraham Maslow's than to those of Freud.[citation needed]
Upon returning to the United States, Watts recorded two seasons of a television series (1959-1960) for KQED public television in San Francisco, "Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life." [14]
In the 1960s, Watts began to experiment with psychedelics, which he had previously dismissed[citation needed], initially with mescaline given to him by Dr. Oscar Janiger. He tried LSD several times with various research teams led by Drs. Keith Ditman, Sterling Bunnell, and Michael Agron. He also tried marijuana and concluded that it was a useful and interesting psychoactive drug that gave the impression of time slowing down. Watts’ books of the ’60s reveal the influence of these chemical adventures on his outlook. He later said about psychedelic drug use, "When you get the message, hang up the phone."[15]
For a time, Watts came to prefer writing in the language of modern science and psychology (Psychotherapy East and West is a good example), finding a parallel between mystical experiences and the theories of the material universe proposed by 20th-century physicists. He later equated mystical experience with ecological awareness, and typically emphasized whichever approach seemed best suited to the audience he was addressing.
Watts's explorations and teaching brought him into contact with many noted intellectuals, artists, and American teachers in the human potential movement. His friendship with poet Gary Snyder nurtured his sympathies with the budding environmental movement, to which Watts gave philosophical support. He also encountered Robert Anton Wilson, who credited Watts with being one of his "Light[s] along the Way" in the opening appreciation of Cosmic Trigger.
Though never affiliated for long with any one academic institution, he did have a fellowship for several years at Harvard University. He also lectured to many college and university students. His lectures and books gave him far-reaching influence on the American intelligentsia of the 1950s–1970s, but he was often seen as an outsider in academia. When questioned sharply by students during his talk at University of California Santa Cruz in 1970, Watts responded that he was not an academic philosopher but rather "a philosophical entertainer".
Watts has been criticized by Buddhists such as Roshi Philip Kapleau, John Daido Loori, and D. T. Suzuki for allegedly misinterpreting several key Zen Buddhists concepts. In particular, he drew criticism from those who believe that zazen can only be achieved by a strict and specific means of sitting, as opposed to a cultivated state of mind available at any moment in any situation. Typical of these is Kapleau's claim that Watts dismissed zazen on the basis of only half a koan.[16] In regard to the aforementioned koan, Robert Baker Aitken reports that Suzuki told him, "I regret to say that Mr. Watts did not understand that story."[17] In Loori's translation of Dogen's The True Dharma Eye, the author also mentions this and expands further to suggest that Zen in its essence is zazen, and cannot be grasped without the practice. This had been the predominant interpretation of Zen in the West before Alan Watts began to write. A major point raised today, however, is that the state of Zen is like that of a dog, always in the moment, regretting nothing[citation needed]. Although in one Koan Zhaozhou is said to have answered that a Dog does not have Buddha nature, in a different Koan from the same period Zhaozhou answered the same question in the positive, demonstrating the disagreements between the sects of 'walking monks' and 'sitting monks' that go back thousands of years. In his talks, Watts addressed the issue of defining zazen practice when he said, "A cat sits until it is tired of sitting, then gets up, stretches, and walks away."
He did, however, have his supporters in the Zen community, including Shunryu Suzuki, the founder of the San Francisco Zen Center. As David Chadwick recounted in his biography of Suzuki, when a student of Suzuki's disparaged Watts by saying "we used to think he was profound until we found the real thing", Suzuki "fumed with a sudden intensity", saying, "You completely miss the point about Alan Watts! You should notice what he has done. He is a great bodhisattva."[18]
Watts sometimes alluded to a group of neighbors in Druid Heights (near Mill Valley, California) who had endeavored to combine architecture, gardening, and carpentry skills to make a beautiful and comfortable life for themselves. These neighbors accomplished this by relying on their own talents and using their own hands, as they lived in what has been called "shared bohemian poverty".[19] Druid Heights was founded by the writer Elsa Gidlow,[20] and Watts dedicated his book The Joyous Cosmology to the people of this neighborhood.[21]
Regarding his intentions, Watts attempted to lessen the alienation that accompanies the experience of being human that he felt plagued the modern Westerner, and (like his fellow British expatriate and friend, Aldous Huxley) to lessen the ill will that was an unintentional by-product of alienation from the natural world. He felt such teaching could improve the world, at least to a degree. He also articulated the possibilities for greater incorporation of aesthetics (for example: better architecture, more art, more fine cuisine) in American life. In his autobiography he wrote, "… cultural renewal comes about when highly differentiated cultures mix".[22]
In his last novel Island (1962), Aldous Huxley mentions the religious practice of maithuna as being something like what Roman Catholics call "coitus reservatus". A few years before, Alan Watts had discussed the theme in his own book Nature, Man and Woman. There, he discusses the possibility of the practice being known to early Christians and of it being kept secretly by the Church.
In his writings of the 1950s, he conveyed his admiration for the practicality in the historical achievements of Chán (Zen) in the Far East, for it had fostered farmers, architects, builders, folk physicians, artists, and administrators among the monks who had lived in the monasteries of its lineages.
In his mature work, he presents himself as "Zennist" in spirit as he wrote in his last book, Tao: The Watercourse Way. Child rearing, the arts, cuisine, education, law and freedom, architecture, sexuality, and the uses and abuses of technology were all of great interest to him.
Though known for his Zen teachings, he was equally if not more influenced by ancient Hindu scriptures, especially Vedanta, and spoke extensively about the nature of the divine Reality Man that Man misses, how the contradiction of opposites is the method of life and the means of cosmic and human evolution, how our fundamental Ignorance is rooted in the exclusive nature of mind and ego, how to come in touch with the Field of Consciousness and Light, and other cosmic principles. These are discussed in great detail in dozens of hours of audio that are in part captured in the ‘Out of Your Mind’ series.
On the personal level, Watts sought to resolve his feelings of alienation from the institutions of marriage and the values of American society, as revealed in his classic comments on love relationships in "Divine Madness" and on perception of the organism-environment in "The Philosophy of Nature".
In looking at social issues he was quite concerned with the necessity for international peace, for tolerance and understanding among disparate cultures. He also came to feel acutely conscious of a growing ecological predicament; as one instance, in the early 1960s he wrote: "Can any melting or burning imaginable get rid of these ever-rising mountains of ruin—especially when the things we make and build are beginning to look more and more like rubbish even before they are thrown away?"[23] These concerns were later expressed in a television pilot made for NET filmed at his mountain retreat in 1971 in which he noted that the single track of conscious attention was wholly inadequate for interactions with a multi-tracked world.
Distrusting both the established political left and right, Watts found political inspiration in the Chinese sage Chuang-Tzu, an ancient Taoist thinker.[citation needed] He disliked much in the conventional idea of "progress". He hoped for change, but personally he preferred amiable, semi-isolated rural social enclaves, and also believed in tolerance for social misfits and eccentric artists. Watts decried the suburbanization of the countryside and the way of life that went with it.
In one campus lecture tour, which Watts titled "The End to the Put-Down of Man", Watts presented positive images for both nature and humanity, spoke in favor of the various stages of human development (including the teenage years), reproached excessive cynicism and rivalry, and extolled intelligent creativity, good architecture and food.[citation needed]
Watts felt that absolute morality had nothing to do with the fundamental realization of one’s deep spiritual identity. He advocated social rather than personal ethics. In his writings, Watts was increasingly concerned with ethics applied to relations between humanity and the natural environment and between governments and citizens. He wrote out of an appreciation of a racially and culturally diverse social landscape.
He often said that he wished to act as a bridge between the ancient and the modern, between East and West, and between culture and nature.
Watts led some tours for Westerners to the Buddhist temples of Japan. He also studied some movements from the traditional Chinese martial art T'ai chi ch'uan, with an Asian colleague, Al Chung-liang Huang.
In several of his later publications, especially Beyond Theology and The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are, Watts put forward a worldview, drawing on Hinduism, Chinese philosophy, panentheism, and modern science, in which he maintains that the whole universe consists of a cosmic self playing hide-and-seek (Lila), hiding from itself (Maya) by becoming all the living and non-living things in the universe, forgetting what it really is; the upshot being that we are all IT in disguise. In this worldview, Watts asserts that our conception of ourselves as an "ego in a bag of skin" is a myth; the entities we call the separate "things" are merely processes of the whole.
Watts's books frequently include discussions reflecting his keen interest in patterns that occur in nature and which are repeated in various ways and at a wide range of scales - including the patterns to be discerned in the history of civilizations.[24] [25]
Watts married three times and had seven children (five daughters and two sons). His oldest son, Mark Watts, currently serves as curator of his father's work.
Watts met Eleanor Everett in 1936, when her mother, Ruth Fuller Everett, brought her to London to study piano. They met at the Buddhist Lodge, were engaged the following year and married in April 1938. A daughter, Joan, was born November 1938 and another, Anne, was born in 1943. Their marriage ended eleven years later, but Watts continued to correspond with his former mother-in-law.[26]
After leaving Eleanor in 1950, Watts married Dorothy DeWitt and moved to San Francisco in early 1951 to teach. They began a family that grew to include five children: Tia, Mark, Richard, Lila, and Diane. However the couple separated in the early sixties after Watts met Mary Jane Yates King while lecturing in New York. After a difficult divorce he married Mary Jane in 1964.
Watts lived with Mary Jane in Sausalito, California, in the mid-60s.[27] He divided his later years between a houseboat in Sausalito called the Vallejo,[28] and a secluded cabin in Druid Heights, on the southwest flank of Mount Tamalpais.
In October 1973, Watts returned from an exhausting European lecture tour to his cabin in Druid Heights. On 16 November 1973, he died in his sleep. He was reported to have been under treatment for a heart condition.[29] He was cremated in a Buddhist ceremony shortly thereafter.[30]

They constitute simplified introductions to the philosophies he taught.
Including recordings of lectures at major universities and multi-session seminars: Many of his works have made it easier for western people to apprehend eastern esoteric thinking, which until now required western people to travel to Asia and spend years learning the subtle nuances of the profound traditions.
As part of his growing popularity, Matt Stone and Trey Parker—creators of the animated series South Park—have also contributed a video tribute by animating some of his lectures. This has spawned a culture of user-animated videos all around the net.[31]
Saybrook University offers the only course on Watts in the United States and perhaps the world (HTP 3075: The Life of Alan Watts). Saybrook also has the only Watts academic chair in the world, which is held by Stanley Krippner, Executive Faculty Member.[citation needed]
His talks inspired Van Morrison to write the song "Alan Watts Blues" for his album Poetic Champions Compose.
Samples from lectures by Alan Watts are featured in the intros or endings of several of STRFKR songs, including "Florida," "Isabella of Castile," "Medicine," "Pistol Pete," "Mystery Cloud," "Hungry Ghost," and "Quality Time". [2]</ref>

=======================================================
The Out of the Trap series features over twenty hours of Alan Watts' most engaging talks drawn from his in-depth seminars, plus a rare talk on education and OM, a sonic experience of mediation and sacred Hindu texts on human identity. 
These live sessions were recorded in the sixties at Esalen in Big Sur, San Francisco, and Los Angeles before enthusiastic audiences at the height of the counter culture movement, and offer powerful insights that have fully come of age.
For the Alan Watts Out of the Trap App we've combed through dozens of Alan Watts lectures to select what we feel are some of his most discussed and most inspiring ideas. 
The app is now available on iTunes for iPod and iPod Touch, and features a curated selection of insightful audio extracts, 50 beautifully illustrated flip cards, vintage animations, and an element of surprise. 
Why Not Now!" with Alan Watts is now available along with the "Essential Alan Watts" in a biographic two-DVD set, and may be ordered at the 
link below. The documentary film on the life and works of Alan Watts began conceptually as a shared storytelling in which the narrative would 
support Alan's own telling of his story.  However during development it became apparent that most of the story could be told through Alan's own 
words, particularly when supported by the wealth of original media we had uncovered including video, film, and photos. The entire process took 
about eighteen months after the initial video restoration, and in the end we were delighted to discover how much of the story was 'in the can' 
once the puzzle pieces came together. To this we added contemporary footage of Japan and Big Sur, music, animation by Eddie Rosas of Alan as a 
young man, and a fly-through of woodcut prints by Tom Killion brought to life by special effects artist Bruce Walters. The film was initially titled 
"Being in the Way" but with the new approach the title was changed to "Why Not Now!", drawn from an LP on the art of contemplation recorded by Alan in 
Each film comes with The Essential Alan Watts, a bonus disc of video materials we couldn't fit into the film, and The Animated Alan Watts 
Every order for Why Not Now? will now include an animated reel featuring vintage and contemporary animations of the spoken words of Alan Watts.
This 23 minute DVD includes extracts from the groundbreaking 1972 series "The Fine Art of Goofing Off" as well as a couple of animations produced by the SouthPark creators and animators. 
The reel has been met with joyous laughter and standing ovations at recent film showings, and is not to be missed!

Wise-Baby: Timeless Teachings of Zen Philosopher Alan Watts, Born Today in 1915  |  Memoir | Biographile	
In Her, the new movie featuring Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, Rooney Mara, and the voice of Scarlett Johansson, writer-director Spike Jonze incorporates the spirit and "voice" of the late Zen philosopher Alan Watts, born on this day in 1915.
The futuristic, artificially intelligent operating system manifestation of Watts (performed by Brian Cox) was inspired by the writings of the English-born scholar turned 1960s California counterculture guru, which Jonze discovered several years ago.
In a recent interview, the filmmaker told the Los Angeles Daily News, "I think for this movie specifically, one of the things he talked about is change and the difficulty for us to accept that everything is in the constancy of change and everything will end."
Since he died in his sleep in 1973 at the age of fifty-eight, Watt’s interpretation of Eastern spirituality has continued to resonate with Western seekers. Although he read and studied widely and traveled the world interacting with some of the twentieth century's most influential minds (D.T. Suzuki, John Cage, Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell, and poet Gary Snyder, among them), Watts would be the first to say that, most importantly, he was on a de-conditioning mission.
The learned anxieties of adulthood are foreign to a baby, he reminds us. In his 1972 autobiography In My Own Way,  he writes of consciously moving himself and others in the direction of “intellectual silence,” defined as “a return to that naked awareness, that vision unclouded by commentary, which we enjoyed as babies in the days when we saw no difference between knower and known, deed and happening.”
The only solution, he says, is to regain the baby’s vision (in combination with adult capacities for communication and empathy): “Seen thus, the world becomes immeasurably rich in color and detail because we no longer ignore aspects of life which adults pass over and screen out in their haste after serious matters.”
Monica Furlong, author of Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts, highlights this interweaving of wisdom with childishness throughout his life. In the biography’s opening pages, she describes the “freshness and honesty” about his philosophy steeped in deep study, and highlights the tendency toward slippery paradox that defined his life. “Watts is not a man on whom it is possible to deliver an easy verdict -- he escapes labels,” she writes.
In his later years, especially, Watts was candid about the interdependent highs and lows of his humanity. In his autobiography, he writes of a segment of his audience that expects “…me to be their guru or messiah or exemplar, and are extremely disconcerted when they discover my ‘wayward spirit’ or element of irreducible rascality, and say to their friends, ‘How could he possibly be a genuine mystic and be so addicted to nicotine and alcohol?’ Or have occasional shudders of anxiety? Or be sexually interested in women? Or lack enthusiasm for physical exercise? Or have any need for money?”
Mark Watts, Alan’s eldest son among his seven children from three wives, has served as producer, writer, and media curator in creating a documentary about his father’s life. As the trailer indicates, Watts the philosopher is best captured in his own words. Settle in for the full film ("Why Not Now!”), available, along with audio recordings of his teachings, on AlanWatts.org, and travel the still very relevant and necessary bridge he helped to build between ancient East and modern West.
