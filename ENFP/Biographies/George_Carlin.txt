George Denis Patrick Carlin[1] (May 12, 1937 – June 22, 2008) was an American comedian, writer, social critic, and actor who won five Grammy Awards for his comedy albums.[2] Carlin was noted for his black comedy as well as his thoughts on politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and various taboo subjects. Carlin and his "Seven dirty words" comedy routine were central to the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court case F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, in which a 5–4 decision by the justices affirmed the government's power to regulate indecent material on the public airwaves. One newspaper called Carlin "the dean of counterculture comedians."[3]
The first of his 14 stand-up comedy specials for HBO was filmed in 1977. From the late 1980s, Carlin's routines focused on sociocultural criticism of modern American society. He often commented on contemporary political issues in the United States and satirized the excesses of American culture. In 2004, Carlin was placed second on the Comedy Central list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians, ahead of Lenny Bruce and behind Richard Pryor.[4] He was a frequent performer and guest host on The Tonight Show during the three-decade Johnny Carson era, and hosted the first episode of Saturday Night Live. His final HBO special, It's Bad for Ya, was filmed less than four months before his death. In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.
George Denis Patrick Carlin was born in Manhattan, New York.[5][6] He was the younger son of The Sun advertising manager Patrick Carlin (1888–1945) and secretary Mary Beary (born c. 1905). He came from a Catholic family of Irish descent, although Carlin himself rejected religion. Patrick was an immigrant from Donegal, Ireland. His parents separated when he was two months old. Mary subsequently raised George and his older brother Patrick Jr. (born October 1, 1931) herself.[1] His maternal grandfather, Dennis Bearey, was an Irish immigrant who worked as a New York City policeman. One immigrant grandmother's maiden name was originally O'Grady, he recalled, but it changed to Grady before she reached America. "They'd dropped the O in the ocean on the way here," he said. He would later name his character on The George Carlin Show O'Grady as an homage.[7] Carlin said he picked up an appreciation for the effective use of the English language from his mother,[8] with whom he had a difficult relationship; he often ran away from home.[9]
He grew up on West 121st Street, in a neighborhood of Manhattan he said he and his friends called "White Harlem", because that "sounded a lot tougher than its real name" of Morningside Heights.[10] He attended Corpus Christi School, a Roman Catholic parish school of the Corpus Christi Church, in Morningside Heights.[11][12] After three semesters, Carlin involuntarily left Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx at age 15. He briefly attended Bishop Dubois High School in Harlem and the Salesian High School in Goshen, NY.[13] He spent many summers at Camp Notre Dame on Spofford Lake in Spofford, New Hampshire. He regularly won the camp's drama award, and specified that after his death a portion of his ashes be spread at the lake.[14]
Carlin joined the United States Air Force when he was old enough, and was trained as a radar technician. He was stationed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, Louisiana. He also began working as a disc jockey at radio station KJOE, in nearby Shreveport. Labeled an "unproductive airman" by his superiors, Carlin was discharged early on July 29, 1957. During his time in the Air Force he had been court martialed three times, and also received many nonjudicial punishments.[15]
In 1959, Carlin and Jack Burns began as a comedy team when both were working for radio station KXOL in Fort Worth, Texas.[16] After successful performances at Fort Worth's beat coffeehouse, The Cellar, Burns and Carlin headed for California in February 1960 and stayed together for two years as a team before moving on to individual pursuits.

Within weeks of arriving in California in 1960, Burns and Carlin put together an audition tape and created The Wright Brothers, a morning show on KDAY in Hollywood. The comedy team worked there for three months, honing their material in beatnik coffeehouses at night.[17] Years later when he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Carlin requested that it be placed in front of the KDAY studios near the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street.[18] Burns and Carlin recorded their only album, Burns and Carlin at the Playboy Club Tonight, in May 1960 at Cosmo Alley in Hollywood.[17]
Stupid disc jockeys ("Wonderful WINO...")—"The Beatles' latest record, when played backwards at slow speed, says 'Dummy! You're playing it backwards at slow speed!'"
Al Sleet, the "hippie-dippie weatherman"—"Tonight's forecast: Dark. Continued dark throughout most of the evening, with some widely scattered light towards morning."
Variations on these routines appear on Carlin's 1967 debut album, Take Offs and Put Ons, recorded live in 1966 at The Roostertail in Detroit, Michigan.[19]
During this period, Carlin became a frequent performer and guest host on The Tonight Show, initially with Jack Paar as host, then with Johnny Carson. Carlin became one of Carson's most frequent substitutes during the host's three-decade reign. Carlin was also cast in Away We Go, a 1967 comedy show that aired on CBS.[citation needed] His material during his early career and his appearance, which consisted of suits and short-cropped hair, had been seen as "conventional", particularly when contrasted with his later anti-establishment material.[20]
Carlin was present at Lenny Bruce's arrest for obscenity. As the police began attempting to detain members of the audience for questioning, they asked Carlin for his identification. Telling the police he did not believe in government-issued IDs, he was arrested and taken to jail with Bruce in the same vehicle.[21]
In the late 1960s, Carlin was making about $250,000 annually.[22] As a tax shelter he bought a private jet: a twin-engine Aero Commander 1121 Jet Commander. Carlin hired pilots to fly him to various tour dates.[23]
Eventually, Carlin changed both his routines and his appearance. Carlin hired talent managers Jeff Wald and Ron De Blasio to help him reinvent his image, making him look more hip for a younger audience. Wald put Carlin into much smaller clubs such as The Troubadour in West Hollywood and The Bitter End in New York City. Wald says that Carlin's income was thus reduced by 90%, but his later career arc was greatly improved.[22] In 1970, record producer Monte Kay formed the Little David Records subsidiary of Atlantic Records, with comedian Flip Wilson as co-owner.[24] Kay and Wilson signed Carlin away from RCA Records, and recorded a Carlin performance at Washington DC's The Cellar Door in May 1971—this was released as FM & AM in January 1972. De Blasio was busy managing the fast-paced career of Freddie Prinze, and was about to sign Richard Pryor, so he released Carlin to Little David general manager Jack Lewis, who was somewhat wild and rebellious, similar to Carlin.[25] Carlin lost some TV bookings by dressing strangely for a comedian of the time, wearing faded jeans and sporting long hair, a beard, and earrings at a time when clean-cut, well-dressed comedians were the norm. Using his own persona as a springboard for his new comedy, he was presented by Ed Sullivan in a performance of "The Hair Piece" and quickly regained his popularity as the public caught on to his sense of style.
Starting in 1972, singer-songwriter Kenny Rankin was Carlin's label mate on Little David Records, and Rankin served many times as Carlin's musical guest or opening act during the early 1970s. The two flew together in Carlin's private jet; Carlin says that Rankin relapsed into using cocaine while on tour, since Carlin had so much cocaine available.[23]
The album FM & AM proved very popular. It marked Carlin's change from mainstream to counterculture comedy. The "AM" side was an extension of Carlin's previous style, with zany but relatively clean routines parodying aspects of American life. The "FM" side introduced Carlin's new style, with references to marijuana and birth control pills, and a playful examination of the word "shit". In this manner, Carlin renewed a style of radical social commentary comedy that Lenny Bruce had utilized in the late 1950s.[22]
In this period Carlin perfected what is perhaps his best-known routine, "Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television", recorded on Class Clown. On July 21, 1972 Carlin was arrested after performing this routine at Milwaukee's Summerfest and charged with violating obscenity laws.[26] The case, which prompted Carlin to refer to the words for a time as "the Milwaukee Seven," was dismissed in December of that year; the judge declared that the language was indecent but Carlin had the freedom to say it as long as he caused no disturbance. In 1973, a man complained to the Federal Communications Commission after listening with his son to a similar routine, "Filthy Words", from Occupation: Foole, broadcast one afternoon over WBAI, a Pacifica Foundation FM radio station in New York City. Pacifica received a citation from the FCC for violating regulations that prohibit broadcasting "obscene" material. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FCC action by a vote of 5 to 4, ruling that the routine was "indecent but not obscene" and that the FCC had authority to prohibit such broadcasts during hours when children were likely to be among the audience (F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978); the court documents contain a complete transcript of the routine).[27]
Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits. Those are the heavy seven. Those are the ones that'll infect your soul, curve your spine and keep the country from winning the war.
The controversy increased Carlin's fame. He eventually expanded the dirty-words theme with a seemingly interminable end to a performance (ending with his voice fading out in one HBO version, and accompanying the credits in the Carlin at Carnegie special for the 1982–83 season) and a set of 49 web pages organized by subject and embracing his "Incomplete List of Impolite Words".[28]
On stage, during a rendition of his "Dirty Words" routine, Carlin learned that his previous comedy album FM & AM had won the Grammy. Midway through the performance on the album Occupation: Foole, he can be heard thanking someone for handing him a piece of paper. He then exclaimed "Shit!" and proudly announced his win to the audience.
Carlin hosted the premiere broadcast of NBC's Saturday Night Live, on October 11, 1975, the only episode to date in which the host did not appear (at his request) in sketches.[29] Carlin however loved the show and encouraged Michael McKenzie to write a book on it, which he did in 1978 [Backstage At Saturday Night Live!/Scholastic Books]. The following season, 1976–77, he appeared regularly on CBS Television's Tony Orlando & Dawn variety series.
Carlin unexpectedly stopped performing regularly in 1976, when his career appeared to be at its height. For the next five years he rarely performed stand-up, although it was at this time that he began doing specials for HBO as part of its On Location series. He later revealed that he had suffered the first of three heart attacks during this layoff period.[30] His first two HBO specials aired in 1977 and 1978.
In 1981, Carlin returned to the stage, releasing A Place for My Stuff and returning to HBO and New York City with the Carlin at Carnegie TV special, videotaped at Carnegie Hall and airing during the 1982–83 season. Carlin continued doing HBO specials every year or every other year over the following decade and a half. All of Carlin's albums from this time forward are from the HBO specials.
Carlin's acting career was primed with a major supporting role in the 1987 comedy hit Outrageous Fortune, starring Bette Midler and Shelley Long; it was his first notable screen role after a handful of previous guest roles on television series. Playing drifter Frank Madras, the role poked fun at the lingering effect of the 1960s counterculture. In 1989, he gained popularity with a new generation of teens when he was cast as Rufus, the time-traveling mentor of the titular characters in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, and reprised his role in the film sequel Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey as well as the first season of the cartoon series. From 1991 to 1995, he narrated the American version of the children's show Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends, and played "Mr. Conductor" on Shining Time Station from 1991 to 1993, Mr. Conductor's Thomas Tales, and Storytime with Thomas and Carlin left Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends after the fourth season and was replaced in 1998 by Alec Baldwin for the fifth and sixth seasons.
Also in 1991, Carlin had a major supporting role in the movie The Prince of Tides, which starred Nick Nolte and Barbra Streisand.
Carlin began a weekly Fox sitcom, The George Carlin Show, in 1993, playing New York City taxicab driver George O'Grady. The show, created and written by The Simpsons co-creator Sam Simon, ran 27 episodes through December 1995.[31] In his final book, the posthumously published Last Words, Carlin said about The George Carlin Show, "I had a great time. I never laughed so much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members Alex Rocco, Chris Rich, Tony Starke. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... [but] ... I was incredibly happy when the show was canceled. I was frustrated that it had taken me away from my true work."[32]
Carlin later explained that there were other, more pragmatic reasons for abandoning his acting career in favor of standup. In an interview for Esquire magazine in 2001, he said, "Because of my abuse of drugs, I neglected my business affairs and had large arrears with the IRS, and that took me eighteen to twenty years to dig out of. I did it honorably, and I don't begrudge them. I don't hate paying taxes, and I'm not angry at anyone, because I was complicit in it. But I'll tell you what it did for me: It made me a way better comedian. Because I had to stay out on the road and I couldn't pursue that movie career, which would have gone nowhere, and I became a really good comic and a really good writer."[33]
Carlin was honored at the 1997 Aspen Comedy Festival with a retrospective, George Carlin: 40 Years of Comedy, hosted by Jon Stewart. His first hardcover book, Brain Droppings (1997), sold nearly 900,000 copies and spent 40 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list.[34] In 1999 Carlin played a supporting role as a satirical Roman Catholic cardinal in Kevin Smith's movie Dogma. He worked with Smith again with a cameo appearance in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and later played an atypically serious role in Jersey Girl as the blue-collar father of Ben Affleck's character.
In 2001 Carlin was given a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 15th Annual American Comedy Awards. In December 2003 Representative Doug Ose (R-California) introduced a bill (H.R. 3687) to outlaw the broadcast of Carlin's "seven dirty words",[35] including "compound use (including hyphenated compounds) of such words and phrases with each other or with other words or phrases, and other grammatical forms of such words and phrases (including verb, adjective, gerund, participle, and infinitive forms)." (The bill omitted "tits", but included "asshole", which was not one of Carlin's original seven words.) The bill was referred to the House Judiciary Committee on the Constitution in January 2004, where it was tabled.[35]
Carlin performed regularly as a headliner in Las Vegas, but in 2004 his run at the MGM Grand Las Vegas was terminated after an altercation with his audience. After a poorly received set, filled with dark references to suicide bombings and beheadings, Carlin complained that he could not wait to get out of "this fucking hotel" and Las Vegas; he wanted to go back east, he said, "where the real people are". He continued:
People who go to Las Vegas, you've got to question their fucking intellect to start with. Traveling hundreds and thousands of miles to essentially give your money to a large corporation is kind of fucking moronic. That's what I'm always getting here is these kind of fucking people with very limited intellects.
An audience member shouted, "Stop degrading us!" Carlin responded, "Thank you very much, whatever that was. I hope it was positive; if not, well, blow me." He was immediately fired, and soon thereafter his representative announced that he would begin treatment for alcohol and prescription painkiller addiction on his own initiative.[36][37]
Following his thirteenth HBO Special on November 5, 2005, entitled Life Is Worth Losing[38] and aired live from the Beacon Theatre in New York City – during which he mentioned, "I've got 341 days of sobriety" — Carlin toured his new material through the first half of 2006. Topics included suicide, natural disasters, cannibalism, genocide, human sacrifice, threats to civil liberties in America, and the case for his theory that humans are inferior to other animals. At the first tour stop at the Tachi Palace Casino in Lemoore, California in February, Carlin mentioned that the appearance was his "first show back" after a six-week hospitalization for heart failure and pneumonia.
Carlin voiced a character in the Disney/Pixar animated feature Cars, which opened on June 9, 2006. The character, Fillmore, is an anti-establishment hippie VW Microbus with a psychedelic paint job and the license plate "51237" — Carlin's birthday. In 2007 Carlin voiced the wizard in Happily N'Ever After, his last film. Carlin's last HBO stand-up special, It's Bad for Ya, aired live on March 1, 2008 from the Wells Fargo Center for the Arts in Santa Rosa, California.[39] Themes included "American bullshit", rights, death, old age, and child rearing. He told his audience to cut through the "bullshit" and "enjoy the carnival".
Carlin met Brenda Hosbrook while touring with Burns and Carlin in Dayton, Ohio in August 1960. They were married at her parents' home in Dayton on June 3, 1961.[40] The couple's only child, Kelly, was born on June 15, 1963. In 1971 the couple renewed their wedding vows in Las Vegas. Brenda died of liver cancer on May 11, 1997, the day before Carlin's 60th birthday.
In November 1997, Carlin met Sally Wade, a comedy writer based in Hollywood; Carlin described it as "love at first sight", but was hesitant to act on his feelings so soon after Brenda's death.[41] They eventually married on June 24, 1998, in a private, unregistered ceremony. The marriage lasted until Carlin's death, two days before their tenth anniversary.[42]
Carlin's material falls under one of three self-described categories: "the little world" (observational humor), "the big world" (social commentary), and the peculiarities of the English language (euphemisms, doublespeak, business jargon), all sharing the overall theme of (in his words) "humanity's bullshit", which might include murder, genocide, war, rape, corruption, religion and other aspects of human civilization. He was known for mixing observational humor with larger social commentary. His delivery frequently treated these subjects in a misanthropic and nihilistic fashion, such as in his statement during the Life is Worth Losing show:
I look at it this way... For centuries now, man has done everything he can to destroy, defile, and interfere with nature: clear-cutting forests, strip-mining mountains, poisoning the atmosphere, over-fishing the oceans, polluting the rivers and lakes, destroying wetlands and aquifers... so when nature strikes back, and smacks him on the head and kicks him in the nuts, I enjoy that. I have absolutely no sympathy for human beings whatsoever. None. And no matter what kind of problem humans are facing, whether it's natural or man-made, I always hope it gets worse.
Language was a frequent focus of Carlin's work. Euphemisms that seek to conceal or distort meaning, and the use of pompous, presumptuous, or silly vocabulary, were often the target of Carlin's routines. When asked on Inside the Actors Studio what turned him on, he responded, "Reading about language." When asked what made him proudest of his career, he said the number of his books that have been sold, close to a million copies.
Carlin also gave special attention to prominent topics in American and Western culture, such as obsession with fame and celebrity, consumerism, conservative Christianity, political alienation, corporate control, hypocrisy, child raising, fast food diet, news stations, self-help publications, blind patriotism, sexual taboos, certain uses of technology and surveillance, and the pro-life position,[43] among many others. For example, Carlin often criticized elections as an illusion of choice.[44] He said the last time he voted was in 1972, for George McGovern, who ran for President against Richard Nixon.[45]
Carlin openly communicated in his shows and in his interviews that his purpose for existence was entertainment, that he was "here for the show." He professed a hearty schadenfreude in watching the rich spectrum of humanity slowly self-destruct, in his estimation, of its own design, saying, "When you're born, you get a ticket to the freak show. When you're born in America, you get a front-row seat." He acknowledged that this is a very selfish thing, especially since he included large human catastrophes as entertainment. In his You Are All Diseased performance, he elaborated somewhat on this, telling the audience, "I have always been willing to put myself at great personal risk for the sake of entertainment. And I've always been willing to put you at great personal risk, for the same reason!"
In the same interview, he recounted his experience of a California earthquake in the early 1970s as "an amusement park ride. Really, I mean it's such a wonderful thing to realize that you have absolutely no control, and to see the dresser move across the bedroom floor unassisted is just exciting."
A routine in Carlin's 1999 HBO special You Are All Diseased focusing on airport security leads up to the statement: "Take a fucking chance! Put a little fun in your life! Most Americans are soft and frightened and unimaginative and they don't realize there's such a thing as dangerous fun, and they certainly don't recognize a good show when they see one." Along with wordplay and sex jokes, Carlin had always included politics as part of his material, but by the mid-1980s he had become a strident social critic in both his HBO specials and the book compilations of his material, bashing both conservatives and liberals alike.
Carlin often criticized religion, God, and religious adherents in his comedy. He described what he saw as the flaws of organized religion in interviews and performances, such as his "Religion" and "There Is No God" routines in You Are All Diseased. In his last HBO stand up show, It's Bad for Ya, he mocked traditional oath affirmations on the Bible as "bullshit",[46] "make believe", and "kid stuff". He described the types of hats that religions ban, or require, as part of their practices, and remarked that he would never want to be a part of a group that requires or bans the wearing of hats. Carlin joked in his second book, Brain Droppings, that he worshipped the Sun (because he could see it), and prayed to Joe Pesci ("because he seems like a guy who could get things done"). In a 2008 interview, Carlin stated that using cannabis, LSD and mescaline helped him in his personal life.[47]
Carlin's influences included Danny Kaye,[9][48] Jonathan Winters,[9] Lenny Bruce,[49][50] Richard Pryor,[30] Jerry Lewis,[9][30] the Marx Brothers,[9][30] Mort Sahl,[50] Spike Jones,[30] Ernie Kovacs,[30] the Ritz Brothers[9] and Monty Python.[30] Comedians who have claimed Carlin as an influence include Chris Rock,[51] Jerry Seinfeld,[52] Louis C.K.,[53] Lewis Black,[54] Jon Stewart,[55] Stephen Colbert,[56] Bill Maher,[57] Patrice O'Neal,[58] Adam Carolla,[59] Colin Quinn,[60] Steven Wright,[61] Mitch Hedberg,[62] Russell Peters,[63] Jay Leno,[64] Ben Stiller,[64] Kevin Smith,[65] and Chris Rush.[66]
Carlin had a history of cardiac problems spanning several decades. These included three heart attacks (in 1978 at age 41, 1982 and 1991), an arrhythmia requiring an ablation procedure in 2003, and a significant episode of heart failure in late 2005. He twice underwent angioplasty to reopen narrowed arteries.[67] In early 2005 he entered a drug rehabilitation facility for treatment of addictions to alcohol and Vicodin.[68] He died on June 22, 2008 at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California of heart failure. He was 71 years old.[69][70] His death occurred one week after his last performance at The Orleans Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. In accordance with his wishes he was cremated, his ashes scattered, and no public memorial services were held.[71]
In tribute, HBO broadcast 11 of his 14 HBO specials from June 25–28, including a 12-hour marathon block on their HBO Comedy channel. NBC scheduled a rerun of the premiere episode of Saturday Night Live, which Carlin hosted.[72][73][74] Both Sirius Satellite Radio's "Raw Dog Comedy" and XM Satellite Radio's "XM Comedy" channels ran a memorial marathon of George Carlin recordings the day following his death. Larry King devoted his entire June 23 show to a tribute to Carlin, featuring interviews with Jerry Seinfeld, Bill Maher, Roseanne Barr and Lewis Black, as well as Carlin's daughter Kelly and his brother, Patrick Jr. On June 24, The New York Times printed an op-ed piece on Carlin by Jerry Seinfeld.[75] Cartoonist Garry Trudeau paid tribute in his Doonesbury comic strip on July 27.[76]
Four days before his death the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts named Carlin its 2008 Mark Twain Prize for American Humor honoree.[77] He became its first posthumous recipient on November 10 in Washington, D.C..[78] Comedians honoring him at the ceremony included Jon Stewart, Bill Maher, Lily Tomlin (a past Twain Humor Prize winner), Lewis Black, Denis Leary, Joan Rivers, and Margaret Cho. Louis C.K. dedicated his stand-up special Chewed Up to Carlin, and Lewis Black dedicated his entire second season of Root of All Evil to him.
For a number of years Carlin had been compiling and writing his autobiography, to be released in conjunction with a one-man Broadway show tentatively titled New York City Boy. After his death Tony Hendra, his collaborator on both projects, edited the autobiography for release as Last Words. The book, chronicling most of Carlin's life and future plans (including the one-man show) was published in 2009. The audio edition is narrated by Carlin's brother, Patrick.[79]
The George Carlin Letters: The Permanent Courtship of Sally Wade,[80] by Carlin's widow, a collection of previously-unpublished writings and artwork by Carlin interwoven with Wade's chronicle of the last ten years of their life together, was published in March 2011. The subtitle is a phrase on a handwritten note that Wade found next to her computer upon returning home from the hospital after her husband's death.[81] In 2008 Carlin's daughter Kelly announced plans to publish an "oral history", a collection of stories from Carlin's friends and family.[82] She later indicated that the project had been shelved in favor of completion of her own project,[83] an autobiographical play about her life with her father, A Carlin Home Companion: Growing Up with George, performed by Carlin as a one-woman show.[84][85]
Many writings found on the internet have been falsely attributed to Carlin, including various joke lists, rants, and other pieces. The web site Snopes, an online resource that debunks urban legends and myths, has addressed these forgeries. Many of them contain material that runs counter to Carlin's viewpoints; some are especially volatile toward racial groups, gays, women, the homeless, and other targets. Carlin was aware of these bogus emails and debunked them on his own web site, saying, "Here's a rule of thumb, folks: Nothing you see on the Internet is mine unless it comes from one of my albums, books, HBO specials, or appeared on my web site", and "It bothers me that some people might believe that I would be capable of writing some of this stuff."[94]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Born and raised by his mother in Manhattan, New York City. His parents divorced when he was two months. His mother (as well as his father) worked in marketing, where they met. The long hours the mother worked left the young George by himself for long hours every day, providing him (in his own words), the time he needed to think about various subjects, listen to radio, and practice his impersonations, that where acclaimed by his mother and coworkers since an early age. Carlin started out as a conventional comedian and had achieved a fair degree of success as a Bill Cosby style raconteur in nightclubs and on TV until the late 1960s, when he radically overhauled his persona. His routines became more insightful, introducing more serious subjects. As he aged, he became more cynic and bitter, unintentionally changing his stage persona again in a radical way throughout the 90s. This new George Carlin, usually referred to as the late George Carlin, is one of the most acclaimed and enjoyed by the public and critics. Carlin's forte is Lenny Bruce-style social and political commentary, spiced with nihilistic observations about people and religion peppered with black humor. He is also noted for his masterful knowledge and use of the English language. Carlin's notorious "Seven Dirty Words" comedy routine was part of a radio censorship case that made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1978.
        Stand-up comedy that usually focuses on one of three categories: peculiarities  of the English language, "the little world" (observational humor), and "the big  world" (social commentary), often with a disparaging edge.
        Salty standup comedy monologues with a strong content emphasis on social commentary and language.
      He was the first-ever host of Saturday Night Live (1975) on 10/11/75, as well as the first-ever host of Fridays (1980), an ABC show fashioned after "SNL".
      Received a Hollywood Walk of Fame star in January 1987. It's located at the corner of Vine and Selma Streets, between Sunset and Hollywood Boulevards. Milton Berle presided over the ceremony.
Jack Burns and Carlin were a comedy team from 1960-1962. When they parted ways in 1962, Burns joined the Second City comedy group in Chicago, and Carlin pursued a solo stand-up comedy career.
      The radio broadcast of an uncensored version of his routine "Seven Dirty Words You Can't Say on Radio or Television" became the center of a debate over censorship and FCC legislation over profanity.
      Some of his comedy influences include Spike Jones, The Marx Brothers, Danny Kaye, Jerry Lewis, Lenny Bruce, and Bob Newhart.
      Biography in: "Who's Who in Comedy" by Ronald L. Smith. Pg. 91-93. New York: Facts on File, 1992.  ISBN 0816023387
      Appeared in The Simpsons (1989) episode "D'oh-in' in the Wind," playing a former hippie. In a previous episode of the show, Krusty the Clown is told he's being sued by Carlin for stealing the "Seven Words You Can't Say on Television."
      Attended (but was expelled from) Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx, New York--the same alma mater as Regis Philbin, Martin Scorsese, George Dzundza, Jamal Mashburn and Don DeLillo.
      Has many popular writings on the Internet being falsely attributed to him, such as the anonymous commentaries "I Am a Bad American" and "The Paradox of Our Time," along with several lists of one-liner jokes. Carlin states on his website that he did not write them, and "nothing you see on the Internet is mine unless it came from one of my albums, books, HBO shows, or appeared on my website.
      Just before Christmas 2005, he experienced significant shortage of breath and other heart-related symptoms. On Christmas Day he entered Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Beverly Hills. During an eight-day stay he was treated for a lung infection and narrowed arteries. He received antibiotics and an angioplasty that included the placement of a double stent. The procedure was successful, but he was advised to take things slowly in the New Year.
      Awarded the 2008 Mark Twain Prize for American Humor by the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
      He and his older brother Patrick were raised by a single mother in New York City. Their mother Mary died in 1984 at age 89.
      Spent years writing a one-man show that he planned to do on Broadway before his death. Working titles included "Watch My Language" and "New York City Boy".
      In 1983, he returned to Cardinal Hayes High School for the school's first Hall of Fame dinner-dance, and it was to honor Msgr. Stanislaus P. Jablonski. Jablonski was the priest who told him that "maybe he should attend another school." (He did briefly and returned.) Although they were adversaries as Principal/Student, they had a sense of respect for each other.
      His first wife, Brenda Carlin, was always listed as Executive Producer on all his TV specials until her death. She died of cancer.
      Worked as a Disc Jockey at KXOL-AM 1360 in Fort Worth, Texas for nine months. He was hired on the spot by Program Director Bob Bruton. There he met newsman Jack Burns. They went on to work together as a comedy duo.
      According to George in his A&E Biography profile, when he was young and would ask his mother what the meaning of a word was, she would invariably answer "Go look it up in the dictionary". He says his fascination with words, their meanings, and word play, is where is comedy routine comes from: The dissection of "words". Even his infamous "Seven Dirty Words" routine is about the meanings of these "bad" words.
      He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Live Theatre at 1555 Vine Street in Hollywood, California.
      According to George Carlin's posthumously released autobiography "Last Words", he was planning to release a comedy concert movie called 'The Illustrated George Carlin' in the late 1970s, around the same time as Richard Pryor: Live in Concert (1979). He had part of his second comedy concert, On Location: George Carlin at Phoenix (1978), recorded on film and had planned animated segments and live-action reenactments of his bits (these animated segments would later wind up in his 1984 HBO concert George Carlin: Carlin on Campus (1984). The project went as far as pre-production and casting for the live-action segments, but was abandoned when Carlin ran out of money. He said he didn't regret it since the material wasn't up to his usual best and said it was part of his "micro-world" of stand-up.
      Although his mother almost had an abortion when she was pregnant with him, he has spoken out in favor of abortion rights and even convinced his wife, Brenda, to have one when she became pregnant again in the late '60s, right in the middle of his financial troubles stemming from his outspokenness and lack of clubs willing to book him for it.
      Ran into IRS troubles in the late '70s and early '80s during another lull in work and after a heart attack when his accountants just stashed his tax bills away hoping things would "perk up". He didn't finally get out from under them until years later.
      He once met a young fan of Shining Time Station at an airport, and rather than disillusion him by telling him that Mr. Conductor didn't exist, he patiently explained that he was "on vacation" from the magical island.
      Release of his autobiography, "Last Words" by George with Tony Hendra, will be set for November 2009. [July 2009]
      If you love someone, set them free; if they come home, set them on fire. [from the book Brain Droppings, 1997]
      Honesty may be the best policy, but it's important to remember that apparently, by elimination, dishonesty is the second best policy. Second is not all that bad. [from the book "Brain Droppings"]
      Heart disease has changed my eating habits, but I still cook bacon for the smell. [from the book "Brain Droppings"]
      I'm completely in favor of the separation of church and state. My idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own, so both of them together is certain death. [unsourced]
      I have as much authority as the Pope, I just don't have as many people who believe it. [from the book "Brain Droppings"]
      [March 1997] We use up words like "spiritual" so fast in this culture. Twenty years ago "spiritual" had a distinct meaning. But now there's a lot of jack-off thinkers who just love to talk about the spiritual. And there is a lot of bogus -- is "bogosity" a word? It should be -- a lot of bogosity in these spiritual seekers. So you have to find another way to express it. I just call it "how I fit.
      I think it's the duty of the comedian to find out where the line is drawn and cross it deliberately.
      I would never want to be a member of a group whose symbol was a guy nailed to two pieces of wood. [from "An Interview with Jesus", from the album "A Place for My Stuff"]
      I don't have a fear of heights. I do, however, have a fear of falling from heights. [from the book Napalm & Silly Putty]
      Some national parks have long waiting lists for camping reservations. When you have to wait a year to sleep next to a tree, something is wrong. [from the book "Brain Droppings", p88]
      Don't confuse my point of view with cynicism. The real cynics are the ones who tell you that everything's gonna be all right. [from the introduction to the book "Brain Droppings"]
      Dusting is a good example of the futility of trying to put things right. As soon as you dust, the fact of your next dusting has already been established. [from the book "Napalm & Silly Putty"]
      Frisbeetarianism is the belief that when you die, your soul goes up on the roof and gets stuck.
      The very existence of flamethrowers proves that sometime, somewhere, someone said to themselves, "You know, I want to set those people over there on fire, but I'm just not close enough to get the job done". [from George Carlin: Carlin on Campus (1984)]
      Standing ovations have become far too commonplace. What we need are ovations where the audience members all punch and kick one another. [from the book "Napalm & Silly Putty"]
      [in his will, regarding his funeral] I wish no public service of any kind. I wish no religious service of any kind. I prefer a private gathering at my home, attended by friends and family members... It should be extremely informal, they should play rhythm and blues music, and they should laugh a lot.
      I enjoy criticizing on the basis of "It's you folks." Because I never felt a part of this, I never identified with a local group. I never belonged to any club, organization, or state. I love New York City, but that's a chauvinist thing. I suppose it's a belonging thing. I'm not proud of this country, I don't care what happens to it, I honestly don't give a shit if it all goes up in flames. Having that freedom just made the writing so much more fun.
      I collected autographs as a kid - not in any sort of hardcore way, but just by hanging around the stage doors. And I loved Danny Kaye. He was in the stage show at Radio City, and I went and I stood at that door for over an hour. It was a rainy, cold day - I wasn't in the direct rain, but it was very cold and it was getting dark. And I stood there and waited for Danny Kaye, and he came and I was the only kid there. And he walked right past me. He wouldn't even say anything. And I did my little rap, "Oh please, please, please . . ." And then later I see him with these UNICEF kids, with 30 of them sitting on his lap, and I knew he was full of shit.
      [on being fired from his Las Vegas lounge act in the the early '60s]: I was fired for saying 'shit' in a town where the most popular game is called 'craps'. [from the album "FM & AM"]
      That's my job: thinking up goofy shit. [Said on several different recordings, including A Place for My Stuff]
      Did you ever do this? Look at your dog and think of the saddest thing you can think of. It'll look like it's happening to your dog. All the sadness of the world is in the eyes of a dog. [from On Location: Carlin at Carnegie (1983)]
      Doing new stuff is a point of pride with me. People may not consider it so, but stand-up comedy is one of the performing arts, and artists are supposed to grow and evolve over time. Through the years, my technique has sharpened, my writing has improved and even my observations have grown richer. I can't do old material; I would feel like a failure. Essentially, this job is that of a writer, but a writer who doesn't produce new work all the time is not a writer - he's a typist.
      As long as you have observations to make, as long as you can see things and let them register against your template, as long as you're able to take impressions and compare them with the old ones, you will always have material. People have always asked me: 'Don't you ever think you might run out of ideas? Don't you ever worry about not having anything to say anymore?' Occasionally that does flash through your mind, because it's a natural human impulse to think in terms of beginnings and endings. The truth is, I can't run out of ideas - not as long as I keep getting new information and I can keep processing it.
      If my teacher could have influenced my sexuality, I would have turned out to be a nun. [During the 1970s, responding to the mistaken belief that gay people "recruit" children and shouldn't be teachers]
      Floating around the Internet these days, posted and e-mailed back and forth, are a number of writings attributed to me, and I want people to know they're not mine. Don't blame me. [...] Here's a rule of thumb, folks: Nothing you see on the Internet is mine unless it came from one of my albums, books, HBO shows, or appeared on my website. [from his official website, in response to the massive number of jokes and rants on the internet that are falsely attributed to him.]
      Who says life is sacred? God? Hey, if you read your history, God is one of the leading causes of death. (from _"George Carlin: Back In Town" (1996)_ )
      On election day, I'll be doing the same thing you folks are doing, except when I'm finished masturbating I'm going to have a little more to show for it. (from _"George Carlin: Back In Town" (1996)_ )
      For centuries now, man has done everything he can to destroy, defile, and interfere with nature: clear-cutting forests, strip-mining mountains, poisoning the atmosphere, over-fishing the oceans, polluting the rivers and lakes, destroying wetlands and aquifers...so when nature strikes back, and smacks him on the head and kicks him in the nuts, I enjoy that. I have absolutely no sympathy for human beings whatsoever. None. And no matter what kind of problem humans are facing, whether it's natural or man-made, I always hope it gets worse. (Life is Worth Losing)
      [on The George Carlin Show (1994)] Lesson learned: always check mental health of creative partner beforehand. Loved the actors, loved the crew. Had a great time. Couldn't wait to get the fuck out of there.

Carlin was arrested in 1972 after a performance of his famous "Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television" routine.
In 2008, it was announced that Carlin would receive the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. The announcement came just four days before his death on June 22.
George Carlin Overview:Along with Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor, George Carlin helped define modern stand-up comedy. Practically defining the term "edgy," Carlin always pushed the limits of what comedy could be. His material was often political; more than that, Carlin was the master of "sociological" comedy. He was an expert at calling attention to the things people take for granted, pointing out hypocrisies in human behavior  He loved language, and often dissected the meanings of words and phrases in his act. As time went on, his act became increasingly dark and angry, but he never lost his talent as one of our best social critics.In the Beginning:Born in Manhattan in 1937, George Denis Patrick Carlin was a rebel from a very young age. Raised Roman Catholic primarily by a single mother, Carlin dropped out of school at age 14 and eventually joined the Air Force. After working for several years as a disc jockey, Carlin began to try his hand at comedy. In 1960, he formed a duo with fellow comic Jack Burns; they worked together for two years and released an album, called Burns and Carlin at the Playboy Club Tonight.
George Carlin Reborn:Going it alone in 1962, Carlin released his first solo album, Take-Offs and Put-Ons in 1966. During that time, he was relatively straitlaced, appearing in a jacket and tie during numerous television appearances from The Ed Sullivan Show to The Tonight Show.
As he entered the 1970s, Carlin began a radical transformation that would change comedy forever. Responding to the social and political upheaval of the times, Carlin grew his hair long and began attacking institutions like the government and organized religion. In the process, the once-again rebellious Carlin became the comedic voice of a generation.Seven Dirty Words:In 1972, Carlin came up with what would eventually be his most famous routine: "Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television." The bit, which focused on the arbitrary nature of censorship, got Carlin arrested on charges of obscenity after a Milwaukee performance in 1972. The case was eventually thrown out, but the routine played a significant role in a U.S. Supreme Court case that ultimately upheld the FCC's ability to regulate "indecent" programming on public airwaves. Carlin's battles against the establishment helped make him even more popular among young audiences.George Carlin: Workhorse:After establishing himself as a counterculture icon, Carlin went off the radar for a while. In the late '70s, his appearances were infrequent -- though he did produce his first two HBO specials, Carlin at USC and George Carlin: Again! in 1977 and 1978. It was during this self-imposed "break" that Carlin suffered his first heart attack.
By 1981, Carlin came roaring back to form, releasing his album A Place for My Stuff and his newest HBO special, Carlin at Carnegie, in '81 and '82. From that point on, Carlin would release  an album and/or and HBO special every one to two years for the rest of his career.Carlin Acts:In addition to a prolific stand-up career, Carlin worked regularly in film and television throughout the '80s, 90's and 2000s. He played supporting roles in comedies like Outrageous Fortune and Kevin Smith's Dogma, as well as dramas such as The Prince of Tides and Jersey Girl. His most famous role was probably that of Rufus, the time-traveling guide in the two Bill and Ted films.The always-surprising Carlin even got involved in children's programming, voicing a character on Thomas the Tank Engine and playing "Mr. Conductor" for two seasons on the PBS show Shining Time Station. He also had his own sitcom, The George Carlin Show, on FOX from 1993 to 1995.
In March of 2008, HBO aired Carlin's stand-up special, It's Bad for Ya. It would end up being his last. Having suffered from heart problems for a large part of his life (he survived three non-fatal heart attacks), Carlin was admitted to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, California, complaining of chest pains on June 22, 2008. Later the same day, he died of heart failure. He was 71 years old.
Carlin was present during Lenny Bruce's legendary arrest for obscenity. When he refused to provide identification to the police, he was arrested and put in the same car as Bruce.

Counterculture comedian George Carlin was born May 12, 1937, in the Bronx, New York. A disciple of Lenny Bruce,  Carlin was arrested for violating obscenity laws in 1972 after a radio broadcast of an uncensored version of his routine "Seven Dirty Words You Can't Say on Radio or Television." The broadcast became the center of a debate over censorship, and FCC legislation over profanity. A self-professed atheist and avid cocaine user, Carlin's adversaries deemed him anti-religious and disrespectful of society. Raised in a Roman Catholic home, and having been educated in parochial school, Carlin is said to have developed his negative attitude towards religion during his tenure as an altar boy.A high school dropout, Carlin enlisted in the army, got his high school equivalency, and moonlighted as a disc jockey at a Louisiana radio station, where he was stationed. In 1959, Carlin teamed up with Texas newscaster, Jack Burns, collaborating on a morning radio show in Fort Worth before relocating to Hollywood, where they attracted Bruce's attention. He helped Burns and Carlin secure appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. After Burns and Carlin split up, Carlin continued to make numerous appearances on The Tonight Show, as well as, The Merv Griffin Show. In the early 1960s, Carlin got his start as a stand-up comic performing on the Las Vegas circuit and entertaining TV audiences. Carlin enjoyed moderate success until the mid-70s when he re-invented his image and adopted his less conventional, somewhat vulgar comedy routine.On October 11, 1975, Carlin became the first host of NBC-TV's Saturday Night Live. Carlin recorded 23 comedy albums and received four Grammy Awards. He starred in 14 HBO specials, and published three best-selling books. In addition to his acting, writing and recording, Carlin performed about 150 dates a year on the road. Carlin was widowed in May 1997, when his wife Brenda died of complications from liver cancer. The two were married for 34 years and had a daughter Kelly.  Carlin received a Hollywood Walk of Fame star in January of 1987, and was inducted into the Comedy Hall of Fame in November of 1994.  In June 2008, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC, announced that Carlin would be the year's recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, which is given out in November.  Just four days later, on June 22, 2008, Carlin died of heart failure.
Despite a lull in his career, George Carlin (1937-2008) has secured his reputation as one of America's greatest comedians. He has performed regularly on television with the likes of Ed Sullivan, Tom Jones, Steve Allen, Jackie Gleason, and Carol Burnett, worked the major nightclub circuit, and starred in a Fox television sitcom, "The George Carlin Show".In the late-1960s, Carlin drifted into his thirties, dissatisfied and uninspired with comedy. Even Carlin's promotional literature admits: "[B]ecause of the influence television was having on his career, Carlin's material grew bland and safe. The rebellious, anti-establishment tone of some of his earlier routines had disappeared."Anyone who has seen a Carlin performance knows his comedy turns on biting brilliance. As Richard Zoglin of Time noted about the funnyman's early days, "Carlin's unctuous radio deejays, TV newscasters and commercial pitchmen were not simple parodies: he used them to satirize a whole society that had its priorities out of whack." Fortunately, for Carlin and his fans, his early-thirty something career crisis was short-lived. By the age of 35, he had released a Grammy-winning album, FM & AM, appeared countless times on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show, hosted the first Saturday Night Live, and captured a corner of the cable market with his taped performances on HBO. Carlin has pushed his career at full-tilt ever since, and the payoff, as the comedian himself might say, has been "tangible recognition": a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, two Grammy awards, a popular book of his comedy, and movie roles. "He's at the top of his game now and the only comedian with his degree of fame who's doing standup exclusively 150 nights a year," the New York Daily News observed as Carlin approached 60. "He tapes an hour-long HBO special every two years and wishes he could do two hours every year. 'I've got a lot of things to say,' he insists."Carlin realized the pleasures of humor as a kid growing up in New York City. "I remember being pretty young and just saying something funny to my mother, and I remember I got a genuine laugh from her, you know how you can tell the difference?" he told the New Jersey Herald. "That's when I knew I could be funny." Armed with that homebred confidence, Carlin took his talent public, performing standup on his neighborhood streets, at high school, and in the Air Force. At the age of 19, while still in the Armed Services, he landed his first professional entertainment job working as a radio station disc jockey. Several years and radio stations later, Carlin joined up with newsman Jack Burns and developed a successful nightclub act that toured top stages around the country and earned a spot on The Tonight Show with Jack Paar. Two years later, Carlin struck out on his own.For two years, Carlin honed his humor at a Greenwich Village cafe in New York City before breaking into television. Carlin's standup acts were a hit on shows hosted by the biggest names in the business: Merv Griffen, Mike Douglas, and Johnny Carson. Indeed, the performers Carlin joined on the stage reads like a "Who's Who of Post World War II Comics," including Steve Allen, Jackie Gleason, and Carol Burnett.Eyes The Big ScreenYet, despite his comic success on television, Carlin yearned for an acting career on the big screen, much like the comedians-turned-actors Bob Hope and Danny Kaye. Although he landed a role in the Doris Day film With Six You Get Egg-Roll, and a guest part on That Girl, Carlin was discouraged by his lack of success. Years later, he dabbled in the profession again - appearing in such flicks as Car Wash, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and Prince of Tides, with Barbra Streisand and Nick Nolte - but the experiences, coupled with a failed Fox network sitcom, only deepened his conviction that comedy was his calling. "I care a lot about my ideas," Carlin told the Toldeo Blade in 1995. "My mind is active, and I think hard and think a lot. I don't think a lot of stand-up people stay with it long enough to discover themselves. They see it as a stepping stone. Circumstances forced me to stay with it longer, and I discovered that I had something more to offer, and something else to do with myself. All of these guys that came out of Saturday Night Live and Second City on television - those two shows were always considered subversive, you know? They were the enemies of The Establishment. But the first thing they do when they come out here to Hollywood is start doing these crappy formula studio movies."Though the material for Carlin's humor has changed during his long career, his fierce criticism of mainstream culture has not. He possesses a sensibility that has been described by writers as "caustic," "acerbic," "angry," and "irreverent." Carlin, during an interview with the Denver Post, admitted: "Anyone who's intelligent who isn't somewhat angry is probably missing the point somewhere along the way. The way I put it is this: This species is a failure that has organized itself incorrectly, and it's stuck and will never get out of it because the forces that keep it this way are much too powerful to change. So I gave up on this species, and I kind of try to look at it from a distance, but I can't completely give up because I'm a part of it. So there's this tension, and that creates a kind of anger that is easy to theatricalize." Such razor-sharp pessimism prompted at least one reporter from the Bellingham Herald to ask Carlin: "Is this all meant tongue-in-cheek?" To which the humorist replied, "No, it's not. I'm only being partly facetious. If you scratch any cynic, you'll find a disappointed idealist."Challenges AudienceCarlin sharpened his comic focus in the early '70s. He emerged from his brief period of professional unrest with a new appetite for scathing commentary, for "testing the limits," as Zoglin of Time wrote, "challenging his audience, shouting from the depths of his social-activist soul." Carlin's most direct challenge appeared on the album Class Clown with a performance titled "The Seven Words You Can't Say on Television." After its release, community leaders tried to ban Carlin's concerts in their cities. "He was arrested several times for obscenity (all of which were dismissed), and fought the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] in a protracted legal battle," noted the St. Petersburg Times. Carlin's fight with the FCC ultimately was settled in a landmark Supreme Court ruling, which, according to Time, "upheld an FCC ban on 'offensive' material during hours when children are in the audience." Carlin, however, scored with his fans - Class Clown sold more than 100,000 copies. Moreover, Carlin continued to "keep a foot in the mainstream as well as the counterculture," as Zoglin of Time put it, by hosting the first edition of Saturday Night Live and subbing for Johnny Carson on the Tonight Show.Thanks to cable television, Carlin also kept himself firmly entrenched in mass media. His first HBO show, a taped performance of On Location: George Carlin at USC, was so popular the cable company ran seven more Carlin shows, including a 1982 performance at Carnegie Hall and 1993 broadcast from the Paramount Theater at New York's Madison Square Garden called Jammin' in New York. Of that last performance, Zoglin of Time wrote, it "may not be his best, but it is almost certainly his angriest. Carlin's attack on America's war culture (complete with phallic interpretation of the gulf war) is too strident; his ridicule of golf ('an arrogant, elitist game that takes up entirely too much room in this country') too meanspirited. But he is, as usual, a whiz on the subject of language, this time our tendency to add unnecessary words to connote importance - 'shower activity' or 'emergency situation.' ('We know it's a situation. Everything is a situation.')"Carlin is proud of his ability to offend - in fact, he considers it central to his success. "I don't care what happens to this planet, this race, the country," he told Jeff Rusnak of the Florida Sun Sentinel. "And being emotionally detached … gives the artist complete freedom to attack, to observe from a distance and not have this sort of echo in the background that 'this could be a lot better, folks."' That "distance," he explained, has always existed in his life. "What really freed me was I began to realize that I don't identify with the human experience, with the national experience, and in fact, most of my life, didn't identify with the local group, no matter what it was, my school, the Air Force, my family, religion, commerce. Therefore I have no stake in the outcome."Carlin's career has always been a high-wire act. He's a master of balancing his outrageous observations with enough humor to keep his fans laughing, and coming back for more. That his distinctive brand of comedy has weathered more than three decades, as well as his own personal struggles with "heavy drug use," according to Time, suggests Carlin delivers far more than a good joke. "I never understand why people ask whether I get tired of what I do. No, I don't get tired, I chose to do this," he once told the New Jersey Herald. "This is my art, to interpret the world."Further ReadingBellingham Herald, November 30, 1995, p.

The titles of his popular record albums "Weird Behavior" and "Class Clown" sum up the childhood deportment of American comedian George Carlin.  He tried to fit into the mainstream, but school was too confining. Carlin dropped out of high school to join the Air Force as a radar mechanic, and while stationed in Shreveport, Louisiana, the 17-year-old Carlin was given a shift as a deejay on a local radio station. At 18, Carlin teamed with the station's newsman Jack Burns and hit the nightclub circuit with a comedy act. Things didn't congeal, and soon both performers went their separate ways (Burns would later team more successfully with Avery Schreiber, then go on to become an influential comedy writer and producer). In the mid 1960s, Carlin began building a following with appearances on variety programs, delivering soon-to-be classic routines about Indian war parties ("You wit' the beads...get outta line"), crack-brained deejays ("Wonderful WINO....") and Al Sleet, the Hippie-Dippie weather man. This fresh burst of celebrity led to Carlin's  being hired as a regular on Away We Go,  the 1967 summer replacement for The Jackie Gleason Show.  Carlin remained popular, but grew tired of pulling out the same routines in show after show; he also rebelled against the conservatism of his physical appearance. Before the 1960s had become the 1970s, Carlin had lost several TV jobs by dressing hippie-style, replete with beard and earrings. But changing public tastes made such eccentricity salable again, and soon Carlin was hot again. One of his more popular routines was one that he couldn't deliver on the air: "The Seven Words You Can't Use On Television." This more than any other piece of material would both deify Carlin with his fans and vilify him with the conservative element: an FM radio station nearly lost its license for playing the "Seven Words" routine, while Carlin himself was arrested during a Milwaukee appearance for violating obscenity laws. This served to solidify Carlin's  link with the down-with-everything youth culture of the era, which may be why the comedian was the first guest on the doggedly anti-establishment Saturday Night Live.  Carlin's  performances became renowned for their unpredictability in the 1970s and early 1980s; sometimes he'd stalk off in the middle of the act if the laughs weren't there, other times he'd verbally abuse the audience, and still other times he wouldn't show up at all. By the mid 1980s, he had cleaned up his personal act (if not his public one); he landed and sustained 
the surprising assignment of narrating a children's series (the British animated program Thomas and Friends); appeared in a supporting capacity in the 1987 Arthur Hiller female buddy comedy Outrageous Fortune!; and in 1989 became something of a teen idol thanks to his appearances as mentor-from-the-future Rufus in the lowbrow but profitable Bill and Ted movies. He also catered to audiences of a much different demographic, with a fine supporting role in Barbra Streisand's The Prince of Tides (1991). With nearly three decades of lofty career heights and equally precipitous lows behind him, Carlin then signed to star in a weekly sitcom for the Fox Network in 1993, in which he played a cab driver named George - and within a few weeks was up to his old tricks by weaving a heavily bleeped variation of those "Seven Words" into one of the plotlines. 
The George Carlin Show debuted in January of 1994, but failed to connect with audiences and folded after a single season. This only marked the beginning of a career resurgence for Carlin, however - one that witnessed him maintaining a busier schedule than ever before over the decade and a half that followed. He cropped up in numerous additional features - including the gag-a-minute farce Scary Movie 3 (2003) and the Pixar/Disney CG-animated family film Cars (2006) (in which he voiced one of the titular automobiles); he also headlined numerous stand-up specials for HBO and continued to tour up through the time of his death. Carlin died of heart failure in June 2008 at the age of 71, about a year after issuing three new stand-up recordings back-to-back: Brain Droppings, Napalm and Silly Putty, and More Napalm and Silly Putty. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi
Famed for his landmark "Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television" routine, George Carlin filled the void created by the death of Lenny Bruce, honing a provocative, scathing comic style that bravely explored the limits of free speech and good taste. George Dennis Carlin was born on May 12, 1937, in the Bronx, NY. While serving a stint in the military, he was stationed in Shreveport, LA, where he began working as a disc jockey; after working with fellow radio personality Jack Burns on a Shreveport morning show, in 1955 the duo began performing in clubs as a comedy team. Burns & Carlin made their recorded debut in 1960 with a live show consisting of their rendition of Lenny Bruce's "Dijinni in the Candy Store" routine (Bruce was an early supporter of the duo as well as a major influence), along with a spot-on impersonation of Mort Sahl and the sketch "Captain Jack and Jolly George," a spoof of children's shows inviting young girls to "send for your Lolita kit."
By and large, the Burns & Carlin team found little success, and eventually broke up; their album was released on the tiny Era Records label under the name Burns & Carlin at the Playboy Club Tonight (despite having been recorded at Hollywood's Cosmo Alley), but failed to generate much attention. Meanwhile, Burns split to begin working with Avery Schreiber. Striking out on his own, Carlin initially worked in roles that cast him as a clean-cut, straight-laced performer; his proper solo debut, 1967's Take Offs and Put Ons (recorded at The Roostertail in Detroit, MI) offered clever if mild-mannered routines like "Wonderful WINO," about a mindless disc jockey. That year he was also tapped to co-star in Away We Go, a summer replacement series for The Jackie Gleason Show; still, despite his success, Carlin found his suit-and-tie image stifling, and began gravitating toward the image and ideals of the counterculture.
Re-emerging as a long-haired, bearded, denim-clad hippie, he lost many of his high-paying gigs, but his riffs on sex, drugs, and politics quickly gained an avid following among the fringe culture. While 1972's FM & AM offered an even split between the safer material of his past work and the more incendiary routines of the "new" Carlin, 1972's Class Clown and the following year's Occupation Foole marked his full evolution into a counterculture icon. Most notably, Class Clown featured the recorded debut of the "Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television" bit, the subject of a Supreme Court ruling after the FCC nearly stripped Pacifica Radio of its FM license for playing the routine on the air. At the same time, Carlin himself was arrested after a Milwaukee concert appearance for violating local obscenity laws. 
The controversy only made him a bigger star, and in 1975 he was tapped to host the debut episode of the NBC sketch comedy showcase Saturday Night Live. The same year also saw the release of the LP An Evening with Wally Londo Featuring Bill Slaszo, highlighted by an early performance of what soon evolved into his popular "Baseball -- Football" routine. In 1976 Carlin appeared in the film Car Wash, and in 1977 he issued On the Road. However, as a new breed of way-out comedians like Steve Martin, Robin Williams, and Andy Kaufman began to emerge, Carlin's brand of incisive sociopolitical commentary began to fall from favor; plagued by substance abuse problems, he did not record again until 1981's A Place for My Stuff, and gained a reputation for unpredictable, often abusive on-stage behavior.
By the middle of the decade, he resurfaced clean and sober for 1985's Carlin on Campus and 1986's Playin' with Your Head, which reprised material from recent cable TV and home video performances. After 1988's What Am I Doing in New Jersey?, he found a new following among teens thanks to his appearances in the popular Bill and Ted screen comedies; in the early '90s, he courted an even younger audience by assuming the lead role on the PBS children's series Shining Time Station. Still, Carlin did not neglect his core audience; 1990's Parental Advisory, Explicit Lyrics and 1992's Jammin' in New York found him as feisty as ever, and in 1994 he starred as an abrasive cabdriver in the short-lived Fox television sitcom The George Carlin Show. Additionally, he continued to tour constantly, and in 1997 issued the album Back in Town. Like many of his '90s recordings, 1999's You Are All Diseased was issued as a complement to an hourlong HBO special. 
Carlin continued to perform throughout the country on an intensive basis, and issued his politically fueled Complaints and Grievances shortly after the September 11th tragedy. It was followed by 2006's Life Is Worth Losing and 2008's It's Bad for Ya. Both featured some of his bleakest material to date, the latter being driven by the subject of death. It was announced that  Carlin would be the recipient of the 2008 Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, to be awarded in November 2008 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Only days later, on June 22, 2008, Carlin died of heart failure in Santa Monica, CA. The Kennedy Center announced that Carlin would receive the prize posthumously and that the November event would be dedicated to him. ~ Jason Ankeny, Rovi

George Denis Patrick Carlin (May 12, 1937 – June 22, 2008) was an American stand-up comedian, social critic, satirist, actor, and writer/author who won five Grammy Awards for his comedy albums.[22] Carlin was noted for his black humor as well as his thoughts on politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and various taboo subjects. Carlin and his "Seven Dirty Words" comedy routine were central to the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court case F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, in which a 5–4 decision by the justices affirmed the government's power to regulate indecent material on the public airwaves.
The first of his 14 stand-up comedy specials for HBO was filmed in 1977. From the late 1980s, Carlin's routines focused on socio-cultural criticism of modern American society. He often commented on contemporary political issues in the United States and satirized the excesses of American culture. His final HBO special, It's Bad for Ya, was filmed less than four months before his death. In 2004, Carlin placed second on the Comedy Central list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time, ahead of Lenny Bruce and behind Richard Pryor.[23] He was a frequent performer and guest host on The Tonight Show during the three-decade Johnny Carson era, and hosted the first episode of Saturday Night Live. In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.
Carlin was born in Manhattan,[24][25] the second son of Mary (Beary), a secretary, and Patrick Carlin, a national advertising manager for the New York Sun.[26] Carlin was of Irish descent and was raised a Roman Catholic; he called himself Irish Catholic.[27][28][29]
He grew up on West 121st Street, in a neighborhood of Manhattan which he later said, in a stand-up routine, he and his friends called "White Harlem", because that sounded a lot tougher than its real name of Morningside Heights. He was raised by his mother, who left his father when Carlin was two months old.[30] He attended Corpus Christi School, a Roman Catholic parish school of the Corpus Christi Church, in Morningside Heights.[31][32] After three semesters, at the age of 15, Carlin involuntarily left Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx and briefly attended Bishop Dubois High School in Harlem.[33] Carlin had a difficult relationship with his mother and often ran away from home.[2] He later joined the United States Air Force and was trained as a radar technician. He was stationed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, Louisiana.
During this time he began working as a disc jockey at radio station KJOE, in the nearby city of Shreveport. He did not complete his Air Force enlistment. Labeled an "unproductive airman" by his superiors, Carlin was discharged on July 29, 1957. During his time in the Air Force he was court martialed three times, and also received many disciplinary punishments.[34] As a boy, Carlin spent many summers at Camp Notre Dame on Spofford Lake in Spofford, New Hampshire. He regularly won the camp's drama award, and specified that after his death a portion of his ashes be spread at the lake.[35]
In 1959, Carlin and Jack Burns began as a comedy team when both were working for radio station KXOL in Fort Worth, Texas.[36] After successful performances at Fort Worth's beat coffeehouse, The Cellar, Burns and Carlin headed for California in February 1960 and stayed together for two years as a team before moving on to individual pursuits.

Within weeks of arriving in California in 1960, Burns and Carlin put together an audition tape and created The Wright Brothers, a morning show on KDAY in Hollywood. The comedy team worked there for three months, honing their material in beatnik coffeehouses at night.[37] Years later when he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Carlin requested that it be placed in front of the KDAY studios near the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street.[38] Burns and Carlin recorded their only album, Burns and Carlin at the Playboy Club Tonight, in May 1960 at Cosmo Alley in Hollywood.[37]
In the 1960s, Carlin began appearing on television variety shows, notably The Ed Sullivan Show and The Tonight Show. His most famous routines were:
Stupid disc jockeys ("Wonderful WINO…")—"The Beatles' latest record, when played backwards at slow speed, says 'Dummy! You're playing it backwards at slow speed!'"
Al Sleet, the "hippie-dippie weatherman"—"Tonight's forecast: Dark. Continued dark throughout most of the evening, with some widely scattered light towards morning."
Variations on the first three of these routines appear on Carlin's 1967 debut album, Take Offs and Put Ons, recorded live in 1966 at The Roostertail in Detroit, Michigan.[39]
During this period, Carlin became more popular as a frequent performer and guest host on The Tonight Show, initially with Jack Paar as host, then with Johnny Carson. Carlin became one of Carson's most frequent substitutes during the host's three-decade reign. Carlin was also cast in Away We Go, a 1967 comedy show that aired on CBS.[40] His material during his early career and his appearance, which consisted of suits and short-cropped hair, had been seen as "conventional", particularly when contrasted with his later anti-establishment material.[41]
Carlin was present at Lenny Bruce's arrest for obscenity. As the police began attempting to detain members of the audience for questioning, they asked Carlin for his identification. Telling the police he did not believe in government-issued IDs, he was arrested and taken to jail with Bruce in the same vehicle.[42]
Eventually, Carlin changed both his routines and his appearance. He lost some TV bookings by dressing strangely for a comedian of the time, wearing faded jeans and sporting long hair, a beard, and earrings at a time when clean-cut, well-dressed comedians were the norm. Using his own persona as a springboard for his new comedy, he was presented by Ed Sullivan in a performance of "The Hair Piece" and quickly regained his popularity as the public caught on to his sense of style. In this period he also perfected what is perhaps his best-known routine, "Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television", recorded on Class Clown. Carlin was arrested on July 21, 1972, at Milwaukee's Summerfest and charged with violating obscenity laws after performing this routine.[43] The case, which prompted Carlin to refer to the words for a time as "the Milwaukee Seven," was dismissed in December of that year; the judge declared that the language was indecent but Carlin had the freedom to say it as long as he caused no disturbance. In 1973, a man complained to the Federal Communications Commission after listening with his son to a similar routine, "Filthy Words", from Occupation: Foole, broadcast one afternoon over WBAI, a Pacifica Foundation FM radio station in New York City. Pacifica received a citation from the FCC, which sought to fine the company for violating FCC regulations that prohibited broadcasting "obscene" material. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FCC action by a vote of 5 to 4, ruling that the routine was "indecent but not obscene" and that the FCC had authority to prohibit such broadcasts during hours when children were likely to be among the audience. (F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978). The court documents contain a complete transcript of the routine.)[44]
Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits. Those are the heavy seven. Those are the ones that'll infect your soul, curve your spine and keep the country from winning the war.
The controversy increased Carlin's fame. He eventually expanded the dirty-words theme with a seemingly interminable end to a performance (ending with his voice fading out in one HBO version and accompanying the credits in the Carlin at Carnegie special for the 1982-83 season) and a set of 49 web pages organized by subject and embracing his "Incomplete List Of Impolite Words."[45]
While on-stage, during a rendition of his "Dirty Words" routine, Carlin learned that his previous comedy album FM & AM had won the Grammy. Midway through the performance on the album Occupation: Foole, he can be heard thanking someone for handing him a piece of paper. He then exclaims "Shit!" and proudly announces his win to the audience.
Carlin hosted the premiere broadcast of NBC's Saturday Night Live, on October 11, 1975, the only episode (as of at least 2007) in which the host did not appear (at his request) in sketches.[46] The following season, 1976–77, Carlin appeared regularly on CBS Television's Tony Orlando & Dawn variety series.
Carlin unexpectedly stopped performing regularly in 1976, when his career appeared to be at its height. For the next five years, he rarely performed stand-up, although it was at this time that he began doing specials for HBO as part of its On Location series. He later revealed that he had suffered the first of three heart attacks during this layoff period.[5] His first two HBO specials aired in 1977 and 1978.
In 1981, Carlin returned to the stage, releasing A Place for My Stuff and returning to HBO and New York City with the Carlin at Carnegie TV special, videotaped at Carnegie Hall and airing during the 1982-83 season. Carlin continued doing HBO specials every year or every other year over the following decade and a half. All of Carlin's albums from this time forward are from the HBO specials.
He hosted SNL for the second time on November 10, 1984, this time appearing in several sketches. Carlin's acting career was primed with a major supporting role in the 1987 comedy hit Outrageous Fortune, starring Bette Midler and Shelley Long; it was his first notable screen role after a handful of previous guest roles on television series. Playing drifter Frank Madras, the role poked fun at the lingering effect of the 1960s counterculture. In 1989, he gained popularity with a new generation of teens when he was cast as Rufus, the time-traveling mentor of the titular characters in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, and reprised his role in the film sequel Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey as well as the first season of the cartoon series. From 1991 to 1995, he narrated the American version of the children's show Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends, and played "Mr. Conductor" on Shining Time Station from 1991 to 1993 and again in Mr. Conductor's Thomas Tales and Storytime with Thomas. Also in 1991, Carlin had a major supporting role in the movie The Prince of Tides, which starred Nick Nolte and Barbra Streisand.
Carlin began a weekly Fox sitcom, The George Carlin Show, in 1993, playing New York City taxicab driver George O'Grady. The show, created and written by The Simpsons co-creator Sam Simon, ran 27 episodes through December 1995.[47]
In his final book, the posthumously published Last Words, Carlin said about The George Carlin Show, "I had a great time. I never laughed so much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members Alex Rocco, Chris Rich, Tony Starke. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... [but] ... I was incredibly happy when the show was canceled. I was frustrated that it had taken me away from my true work."[48]
In 1997, his first hardcover book, Brain Droppings, was published. The book sold nearly 900,000 copies and spent 40 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list.[49] Carlin was honored at the 1997 Aspen Comedy Festival with a retrospective, George Carlin: 40 Years of Comedy, hosted by Jon Stewart.
In 1999, Carlin played a supporting role as a satirical Roman Catholic cardinal in filmmaker Kevin Smith's movie Dogma. He worked with Smith again with a cameo appearance in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and later played an atypically serious role in Jersey Girl as the blue-collar father of Ben Affleck's character.
In 2001, Carlin was given a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 15th Annual American Comedy Awards. In December 2003, California U.S. Representative Doug Ose (Republican), introduced a bill (H.R. 3687) to outlaw the broadcast of Carlin's "seven dirty words",[50] including "compound use (including hyphenated compounds) of such words and phrases with each other or with other words or phrases, and other grammatical forms of such words and phrases (including verb, adjective, gerund, participle, and infinitive forms)." (The bill omits "tits", but includes "asshole", which was not part of Carlin's original routine.) This bill was never voted on. The last action on this bill was its referral to the House Judiciary Committee on the Constitution on January 15, 2004.[50]
For years, Carlin had performed regularly as a headliner in Las Vegas, but in 2005 he was fired from his headlining position at the MGM Grand Las Vegas in Las Vegas, Nevada, after an altercation with his audience. After a poorly received set filled with dark references to suicide bombings and beheadings, Carlin stated that he could not wait to get out of "this fucking hotel" and Las Vegas, claiming he wanted to go back east, "where the real people are." He continued to insult his audience, stating:
People who go to Las Vegas, you've got to question their fucking intellect to start with. Traveling hundreds and thousands of miles to essentially give your money to a large corporation is kind of fucking moronic. That's what I'm always getting here is these kind of fucking people with very limited intellects.
An audience member shouted back that Carlin should "stop degrading us", at which point Carlin responded, "Thank you very much, whatever that was. I hope it was positive; if not, well, blow me." He was immediately fired by MGM Grand and soon after announced he would enter rehab for alcohol and prescription painkiller addiction.[51][52]
He began a tour through the first half of 2006 following the airing of his thirteenth HBO Special on November 5, 2005, entitled Life Is Worth Losing,[53] which was shown live from the Beacon Theatre in New York City and in which he stated early on: "I've got 341 days of sobriety," referring to the rehab he entered after being fired from MGM. Topics covered included suicide, natural disasters (and the desire to see them escalate in severity), cannibalism, genocide, human sacrifice, threats to civil liberties in America, and how an argument can be made that humans are inferior to other animals.
On February 1, 2006, during his Life Is Worth Losing set at the Tachi Palace Casino in Lemoore, California, Carlin mentioned to the crowd that he had been discharged from the hospital only six weeks previously for heart failure and pneumonia, citing the appearance as his "first show back".
Carlin provided the voice of Fillmore, a character in the Disney/Pixar animated feature Cars, which opened in theaters on June 9, 2006. The character Fillmore, who is presented as an anti-establishment hippie, is a VW Microbus with a psychedelic paint job whose front license plate reads "51237", Carlin's birthday. In 2007, Carlin provided the voice of the wizard in Happily N'Ever After, along with Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze Jr., Andy Dick, and Wallace Shawn, his last film.
Carlin's last HBO stand-up special, It's Bad for Ya, aired live on March 1, 2008, from the Wells Fargo Center for the Arts in Santa Rosa, California.[54] The themes that appeared in this HBO special included "American Bullshit", "Rights", "Death", "Old Age", and "Child Rearing". In his routine, he brought to light many of the problems facing America, and he told his audience to cut through the "bullshit" of the world and "enjoy the carnival". Carlin had been working on the new material for this HBO special for several months prior in concerts all over the country.
In 1961 Carlin married Brenda Hosbrook, whom he met while touring the previous year. The couple's only child, Kelly, was born on June 15, 1963.[55] In 1971 the couple renewed their wedding vows in Las Vegas. Brenda died of liver cancer in 1997, a day before Carlin's 60th birthday. On June 24, 1998 Carlin married Sally Wade in a private, unregistered ceremony. The marriage lasted until he died, two days before their tenth anniversary.[56]
Although raised a Roman Catholic—which Carlin described anecdotally on the albums FM & AM and Class Clown—religion, God, and religious adherents were frequent subjects of criticism in his routines. He described what he saw as the flaws of organized religion in interviews and performances, such as his "Religion" and "There Is No God" routines in You Are All Diseased. In his last HBO stand up show, It's Bad for Ya, he mocked traditional oath affirmations on the Bible as "bullshit",[57] "make believe", and "kid stuff". He described the types of hats that religions ban, or require, as part of their practices, and remarked that he would never want to be a part of a group that requires or bans the wearing of hats. Carlin joked in his second book, Brain Droppings, that he worshipped the Sun (because he could see it), and prayed to Joe Pesci ("because he seems like a guy who could get things done").
Carlin's material falls under one of three self-described categories: "the little world" (observational humor), "the big world" (social commentary), and the peculiarities of the English language (euphemisms, doublespeak, business jargon), all sharing the overall theme of (in his words) "humanity's bullshit", which might include murder, genocide, war, rape, corruption, religion and other aspects of human civilization. He was known for mixing observational humour with larger social commentary. His delivery frequently treated these subjects in a misanthropic and nihilistic fashion, such as in his statement during the Life is Worth Losing show:
I look at it this way... For centuries now, man has done everything he can to destroy, defile, and interfere with nature: clear-cutting forests, strip-mining mountains, poisoning the atmosphere, over-fishing the oceans, polluting the rivers and lakes, destroying wetlands and aquifers... so when nature strikes back, and smacks him on the head and kicks him in the nuts, I enjoy that. I have absolutely no sympathy for human beings whatsoever. None. And no matter what kind of problem humans are facing, whether it's natural or man-made, I always hope it gets worse.
Language was a frequent focus of Carlin's work. Euphemisms that, in his view, seek to conceal or distort the actual meaning and the use of language he felt was pompous, presumptuous, or silly were often the target of Carlin's routines. When asked on Inside the Actors Studio what turned him on, he responded, "Reading about language." When asked what made him most proud about his career, he said the number of his books that have been sold, close to a million copies.
Carlin also gave special attention to prominent topics in American and Western culture, such as obsession with fame and celebrity, consumerism, conservative Christianity, political alienation, corporate control, hypocrisy, child raising, fast food diet, news stations, self-help publications, blind patriotism, sexual taboos, certain uses of technology and surveillance, and the pro-life position,[58] among many others. For example, Carlin often criticized elections as an illusion of choice.[59] He said the last time he voted was in 1972, for George McGovern, who ran for President against Richard Nixon.[60]
Carlin openly communicated in his shows and in his interviews that his purpose for existence was entertainment, that he was "here for the show." He professed a hearty schadenfreude in watching the rich spectrum of humanity slowly self-destruct, in his estimation, of its own design, saying, "When you're born, you get a ticket to the freak show. When you're born in America, you get a front-row seat." He acknowledged that this is a very selfish thing, especially since he included large human catastrophes as entertainment. In his You Are All Diseased concert, he elaborated somewhat on this, telling the audience, "I have always been willing to put myself at great personal risk for the sake of entertainment. And I've always been willing to put you at great personal risk, for the same reason!"
In the same interview, he recounted his experience of a California earthquake in the early 1970s (Feb. 9, 1971; 6am), as "[a]n amusement park ride. Really, I mean it's such a wonderful thing to realize that you have absolutely no control, and to see the dresser move across the bedroom floor unassisted is just exciting."
A routine in Carlin's 1999 HBO special You Are All Diseased focusing on airport security leads up to the statement: "Take a fucking chance! Put a little fun in your life! Most Americans are soft and frightened and unimaginative and they don't realize there's such a thing as dangerous fun, and they certainly don't recognize a good show when they see one."
Along with wordplay and sex jokes, Carlin had always included politics as part of his material, but by the mid-1980s he had become a strident social critic in both his HBO specials and the book compilations of his material, bashing both conservatives and liberals alike. His HBO viewers got an especially sharp taste of this in his take on the Ronald Reagan administration during the 1988 special What Am I Doing in New Jersey?, broadcast live from the Park Theatre in Union City, New Jersey.
Carlin had a history of cardiac problems spanning several decades. These included three heart attacks (in 1978 at age 41, 1982 and 1991), an arrhythmia requiring an ablation procedure in 2003, and a significant episode of heart failure in late 2005. He twice underwent angioplasty to reopen narrowed arteries.[61] In early 2005 he entered a drug rehabilitation facility for treatment of addictions to alcohol and Vicodin.[62] On June 22, 2008, Carlin was admitted to Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica after experiencing chest pain, and he died later that day at 5:55 p.m. Pacific Time of heart failure. He was 71 years old.[63] His death occurred one week after his last performance at The Orleans Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, and he had further shows on his itinerary.[21][64][65] In accordance with his wishes, he was cremated, his ashes scattered, and no public or religious services of any kind were held.[66][67]
In tribute, HBO broadcast 11 of his 14 HBO specials from June 25–28, including a 12-hour marathon block on their HBO Comedy channel. NBC scheduled a rerun of the premiere episode of Saturday Night Live, which Carlin hosted.[68][69][70] Both Sirius Satellite Radio's "Raw Dog Comedy" and XM Satellite Radio's "XM Comedy" channels ran a memorial marathon of George Carlin recordings the day following his death. Larry King devoted his entire June 23 show to a tribute to Carlin, featuring interviews with Jerry Seinfeld, Bill Maher, Roseanne Barr and Lewis Black, as well as Carlin's daughter Kelly and his brother, Patrick.
On June 24, The New York Times printed an op-ed piece on Carlin by Jerry Seinfeld.[71] Cartoonist Garry Trudeau paid tribute in his Doonesbury comic strip on July 27.[72]
Four days before his death, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts had named Carlin its 2008 Mark Twain Prize for American Humor honoree.[73] The prize was awarded in Washington, D.C. on November 10, making Carlin the first posthumous recipient.[74] Comedians honoring him at the ceremony included Jon Stewart, Bill Maher, Lily Tomlin (a past Twain Humor Prize winner), Lewis Black, Denis Leary, Joan Rivers, and Margaret Cho.
Louis C.K. dedicated his stand-up special Chewed Up to Carlin, and Lewis Black dedicated his entire second season of Root of All Evil to him.
For a number of years, Carlin had been compiling and writing his autobiography, to be released in conjunction with a one-man Broadway show tentatively titled New York City Boy. After his death Tony Hendra, his collaborator on both projects, edited the autobiography for release as Last Words (ISBN 1-4391-7295-1). The book, chronicling most of Carlin's life and future plans (including the one-man show) was published in 2009. The audio edition is narrated by Carlin's brother, Patrick.[75]
The George Carlin Letters: The Permanent Courtship of Sally Wade,[77] by Carlin's widow, a collection of previously-unpublished writings and artwork by Carlin interwoven with Wade’s chronicle of the last ten years of their life together, was published in March 2011. The subtitle is the phrase on a handwritten note Wade found next to her computer upon returning home from the hospital after her husband's death.[78]
In 2008 Carlin's daughter Kelly Carlin-McCall announced plans to publish an "oral history", a collection of stories from Carlin's friends and family,[79] but she later indicated that the project had been shelved in favor of completion of her own memoir.[80]
Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends (as American Narrator: Series 3-4\redubbed Series 1-2) (1991–1995)
Many writings found on the internet have been falsely attributed to Carlin, including various joke lists, rants, and other pieces. These have made continuous rounds on the email circuit and still persist to this day on social networking sites such as Facebook. The web site Snopes, an online resource that debunks historic and current urban legends and myths, has extensively addressed these forgeries. Many of them contain material that runs directly opposite to Carlin's well-known viewpoints; some are especially volatile toward racial groups, gays, women, the homeless, and other targets. Carlin was aware of these bogus emails and debunked them on his own web site, saying "Here's a rule of thumb, folks: Nothing you see on the Internet is mine unless it comes from one of my albums, books, HBO specials, or appeared on my web site", and "It bothers me that some people might believe that I would be capable of writing some of this stuff."[89][90][91][92][93][94]

       His radical routines made him the heir apparent to Lenny Bruce. His lifestyle contributed to his image as an outsider, even as he enjoyed mainstream success.
George Carlin will probably always be known best for his legendary "Seven Words..." skit. But his outspoken views and hard-hitting take on America's foibles and hypocrisy have earned him unwanted attention at times--leading to arrests and a landmark Supreme Court decision! Filled with hilarious (edited) clips from throughout his long career, this BIOGRAPHYŽ follows Carlin from his earliest days in stand-up to his role as a catholic cardinal in the controversial movie Dogma, which brought him back to his religious roots. In an extensive and far-ranging interview, he talks about how his anti-establishment views were formed and why they remain as staunch as ever, while friends offer a sometimes-surprising portrait of the man behind the mouth.

George CarlinComedianBorn: 12 May 1937Died: 22 June 2008 (heart failure)Birthplace: New York, New YorkBest known as: The profane comedian known for his "7 Dirty Words" routineGeorge Carlin was the cranky and durable stand-up comedian most famous for his 1970s routine known as "The Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television." After being discharged from the U.S. Air Force in the 1950s, George Carlin began his comedy career on the radio and in nightclubs in Los Angeles in the early 1960s. Throughout the 1960s he did standup while appearing on television sit-coms and talk shows, doing hip-but-clean routines like his famous "hippy-dippy weatherman." But in the 1970s he came into his own as a Grammy-winning comic and social commentator, known for mixing off-color wordplay, goofy absurdity and angry political riffs on albums such as FM & AM and Class Clown (both 1972). That was the era of "Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television," a monologue in which Carlin spoke aloud (and repeatedly) a list of four-letter words deemed too obscene for broadcast. Over the years, Carlin had his own TV specials, wrote books and guest-starred in feature films, most notably as Rufus in 1989's Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (starring Keanu Reeves). As cable TV blossomed in the 1990s, Carlin found that not only could he now say his famous seven words on television, but that he had become a mainstream comedy icon. His records include A Place for My Stuff (1981) and Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics (1990); his books include Brain Droppings (1997) and Napalm and Silly Putty (2001); and his movies include Outrageous Fortune (1987, with Bette Midler) and several Kevin Smith comedies, including Dogma (1999) and Jersey Girl (2004, with Ben Affleck).Extra credit: George Carlin hosted the first episode of NBC's Saturday Night Live in October of 1975... He was "Mr. Conductor" in the '90s on the children's TV shows Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends and Shining Time Station... George Carlin entered the U.S. Air Force in 1954. His official site says he received "three court-martial and numerous Article Fifteens (form of punishment just below court-martial)" during the next three years and was given a "general discharge under honorable conditions" -- one notch below an honorable discharge -- in 1957.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC.

From Chapter One – “I grew up in a world of violence and unpredictability. I learned to protect myself the best I could. I learned to take care of myself because no one else would. I learned to lie, to conceal, and to cover my fear with anger and violence.
No one knew the abuse that went on in our home, as we all learned to keep it hidden. No one knew my wish to make it stop. And later, no one knew the fear that overwhelmed me and drove me to hit and hurt the ones I loved most.”
This book exposes the thinking, beliefs and actions of a child who grows up to find himself being the abuser in his family. We follow his story from before childhood to the beginning of his journey to stop his violent and abusive behaviors.
Lee Cox offers powerful insights into his journey of healing himself. When he shares his story, his courage, candor and honesty inspire his audience to help stop domestic abuse. Lee speaks to: Students, Teachers, Law Enforcement, Domestic Violence Professionals, Civic organizations, Self Help groups and Community Leaders. Contact the EVE Foundation to have Lee speak at your next event.
