This article is about the comedian.  For the character he portrays on Seinfeld, see Jerry Seinfeld (character).
Jerome Allen "Jerry" Seinfeld (born April 29, 1954) is an American comedian, actor, writer, and television/film producer, best known for playing a semi-fictional version of himself in the sitcom Seinfeld (1989–1998), which he co-created and co-wrote with Larry David. For the show's final two seasons, they were co-executive producers.
In his first major foray back into the media since the finale of Seinfeld, he co-wrote and co-produced the 2007 film Bee Movie, also voicing the lead role of Barry B. Benson. In February 2010, Seinfeld premiered a reality TV series called The Marriage Ref on NBC. Seinfeld directed Colin Quinn in the Broadway show Long Story Short at the Helen Hayes Theater in New York which ran until January 8, 2011.
Seinfeld is known for specializing in observational humor, often focusing on personal relationships and uncomfortable social obligations. In 2005, Comedy Central ranked Jerry Seinfeld 12th out of 100 as the greatest comedians of all time in its five-part special The 100 Greatest Standups of All Time.[1]
Jerry Seinfeld was born in the borough of Brooklyn in New York City. His father, Kálmán Seinfeld (1918–1985), was a sign maker of Hungarian Jewish[2][3] descent;[4] his mother, Betty (née Hesney; born 1915),[5] is of Syrian Jewish descent; her family lived in Aleppo.[6]
Seinfeld grew up in Massapequa, New York, and attended East Lake Elementary School and Massapequa High School.[7] At the age of 16, he spent a short period of time volunteering in Kibbutz Sa'ar in Israel.[8] He went to SUNY Oswego, and after his second year he transferred to Queens College, City University of New York, graduating with a degree in communications and theater.[4]
Seinfeld developed an interest in stand-up comedy after brief stints in college productions.[9] In 1976, after graduation from Queens College, he tried out at an open-mic night at New York City's Catch a Rising Star, which led to an appearance in a Rodney Dangerfield HBO special.[4] In 1979, he had a small recurring role on the sitcom Benson, playing Frankie, a mail delivery boy who had comedy routines that no one wanted to hear. However, Seinfeld was abruptly fired from the show due to creative differences.[4] Seinfeld has said that he was not actually told he had been fired until he turned up for the read-through session for an episode, and found that there was no script for him.[10] In May 1981, Seinfeld made a highly successful appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, impressing Carson and the audience and leading to regular appearances on that show and others, including Late Night with David Letterman.[4]
Seinfeld created The Seinfeld Chronicles with Larry David in 1988 for NBC. The show was later renamed Seinfeld to avoid confusion with the short-lived teen sitcom The Marshall Chronicles. By its fourth season, it had become the most popular and successful sitcom on American television. The final episode aired in 1998, and the show has been a popular syndicated re-run.
Along with Seinfeld himself, the show starred Saturday Night Live veteran Julia Louis-Dreyfus and experienced actors Michael Richards and Jason Alexander. Alexander played George, a caricature of Larry David. Seinfeld holds the distinction of being the only actor to appear in every episode of the show.[11]
Seinfeld has said that his show was influenced by the 1950s sitcom The Abbott and Costello Show. In the "Seinfeld Season 6" DVD set, commenting on the episode "The Gymnast", Seinfeld cited Jean Shepherd as an influence, saying, "He really formed my entire comedic sensibility—I learned how to do comedy from Jean Shepherd."
From 2004–2007, the former Seinfeld cast and crew recorded audio commentaries for episodes of the DVD releases of the show. Seinfeld himself provided commentary for numerous episodes.

After his sitcom ended, Seinfeld returned to comedy instead of continuing his acting career. In 1998, he went on tour and recorded a comedy special, entitled I'm Telling You for the Last Time. The process of developing and performing new material at clubs around the world was chronicled in a 2002 documentary, Comedian, which also featured fellow comic Orny Adams and was directed by Christian Charles. Seinfeld has written several books, mostly archives of past routines.
In the late 1990s, Apple Computer came up with the advertising slogan "Think different" and produced a 60-second commercial to promote the slogan. This commercial showed people who were able to "think differently", such as Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and many others. It was later cut short to 30 seconds and altered such that Seinfeld was included at the end, whereas he hadn't been in the original cut. This shorter version of the commercial aired only once, during the series finale of Seinfeld.[12]
In 2004, Seinfeld also appeared in two commercial webisodes promoting American Express, titled The Adventures of Seinfeld & Superman. In these, Seinfeld appeared together with an animated rendering of Superman, who was referenced in numerous episodes of Seinfeld as Seinfeld's hero, voiced by Patrick Warburton, who had portrayed David Puddy on Seinfeld. The webisodes were directed by Barry Levinson. Seinfeld and "Superman" were also interviewed by Matt Lauer in a specially-recorded interview for the Today show.
On May 13, 2006, Seinfeld had a cameo appearance on Saturday Night Live as host Julia Louis-Dreyfus' assassin. Louis-Dreyfus in her opening monologue mentioned the "Seinfeld Curse". While talking about how ridiculous the "curse" was, a stage light suddenly fell next to her. The camera moved to a catwalk above the stage that Seinfeld was standing on, holding a large pair of bolt cutters. He angrily muttered, "Dammit!", upset that it didn't hit her. Louis-Dreyfus then continued to say that she is indeed not cursed.
On February 25, 2007, Seinfeld appeared at the 79th Academy Awards as the presenter for "Best Documentary". Before announcing the nominations, he did a bit of a stand-up comedy routine about the unspoken agreement between movie theater owners and movie patrons.
On October 4, 2007, Seinfeld made a brief return to NBC, guest-starring as himself in the 30 Rock episode "SeinfeldVision".[13]
On February 24, 2008, at the 80th Academy Awards Seinfeld appeared as the voice of his Bee Movie animated character Barry, presenting "Best Animated Short". Before announcing the nominees, he showed a montage of film clips featuring bees, claiming that they were some of his early work (as Barry).
On June 2, 2008, amidst his spring 2008 tour, Seinfeld made a stop in his hometown of New York City for a one-night-only performance at the Hammerstein Ballroom to benefit Stand Up for a Cure, a charity aiding lung cancer research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
In August 2008, the Associated Press reported that Jerry Seinfeld would be the pitchman for Windows Vista, as part of a $300 million advertising campaign by Microsoft. The ads, which were intended to create buzz for Windows in support of the subsequent "I'm a PC" advertisements, began airing in mid-September 2008. They were cut from television after just 3 installments; Microsoft opted to continue with the "I'm a PC" advertisements[14] and run the Seinfeld ads on the Microsoft website as a series of longer advertisements.[15]
In March 2009, it was announced that Seinfeld and the entire cast of Seinfeld would be appearing for a reunion in Larry David's HBO series Curb Your Enthusiasm. The fictional reunion took place in the seventh season's finale.
Seinfeld appeared on an episode of the Starz original series Head Case. As was the case in many of his previous guest appearances on sitcoms, he played himself.
In Australia, Seinfeld appears on a series of advertisements for Greater Building Society, a building society based in New South Wales and southeastern Queensland.[16] His appearance in these ads was highly publicized and considered a coup for the society, being only the third time Seinfeld had appeared in a television commercial.[17] The advertisements were filmed in Cedarhurst, Long Island, with the street designed to emulate Beaumont Street in Hamilton, where the Greater's head offices are located.[18] Seinfeld also wrote the scripts for the 15 advertisements that were filmed. The ads largely aired in the Northern New South Wales television market, where the society has most of its branches.
Seinfeld was the first guest on Jay Leno's talk show, The Jay Leno Show, which premiered on September 14, 2009.
Seinfeld was featured on Saturday Night Live's Weekend Update sketch to do the "Really!?!" segment with Seth Meyers. He executive produced and occasionally starred as a panelist in The Marriage Ref. On August 30, 2010, Seinfeld made a notable surprise guest appearance on The Howard Stern Show, repairing the falling out the two had in the early 90s.
Seinfeld toured the US in 2011 and made his first appearance on stage in the UK in 13 years. In July 2011, he was a surprise guest on The Daily Show, helping Jon Stewart to suppress his urge to tell "cheap" "Michele Bachmann's husband acts gay" jokes.[19] Seinfeld also launched a personal archives website at JerrySeinfeld.com and appeared in the HBO special Talking Funny with fellow comedians Chris Rock, Louis C.K., and Ricky Gervais in the same year.
In 2012, he began an Internet comedy series titled Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.[20] In 2013, Seinfeld is reportedly working with rapper Wale on his fourth studio album, The Album About Nothing.[21] In June 2013, he appeared on rapper Wale's album The Gifted, on the song "Outro About Nothing".[22]
During a January 2014 interview on the “Boomer & Carton” show on radio station WFAN, Seinfeld revealed that a Seinfeld project was being developed in which Alexander will play George Costanza character alongside other “Seinfeld” characters, as well as David. Rumors of a potential reunion were triggered by a photograph that appeared on Twitter in which Seinfeld and Alexander are walking into "Tom's Restaurant," the famous diner from the Seinfeld series.[23]
In 2012, Seinfeld started a web series, Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, in which he would pick up a fellow comedian in a different car each episode and take him or her out for coffee and conversation. The initial series comprised ten 7- to 25-minute episodes. Season 2 (2013) had six episodes, with guests including Don Rickles and David Letterman.[24]
In 2013, Seinfeld was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for the series.[25] When criticized in early 2014 for the lack of women and non-white comedians in the series, he responded, "Who cares? ... You're funny, I'm interested. You're not funny, I'm not."[26]
Seinfeld has said his comic influences include Jean Shepherd, [27] Bill Cosby,[28] George Carlin,[29] Jay Leno,[30] Robert Klein,[29] Abbott and Costello,[31] and Ricardo Montalban.[32]
Among those who say that they have been influenced by Seinfeld are Judd Apatow[33] and Kevin Hart.[33]
Dennis Miller has called him "probably the greatest joke writer ever. ... I find interviews with Jerry to be about as illuminating as anybody in the culture. ... He's probably the funniest comedian of our generation."[34]
Seinfeld wrote the book Seinlanguage, released in 1993. Written as his television show was first rising in popularity, it is primarily an adaptation of the comedian's standup material. The title comes from an article in Entertainment Weekly listing the numerous catch-phrases for which the show was responsible.[35] In 2002, he wrote the children's book Halloween. The book was illustrated by James Bennett.[36]
He wrote the forewords to Ted L. Nancy's Letters from a Nut series of books and Ed Broth's Stories from a Moron.[37] Seinfeld also wrote the foreword to the Peanut Butter & Co. Cookbook.
Years before Seinfeld was created, Seinfeld dated Carol Leifer,[38][39] a fellow comedian and one of the inspirations for the Seinfeld character of Elaine.[40][41] When he was in his late 30s, Seinfeld began a four-year romantic relationship with then-17-year-old high school student Shoshanna Lonstein.[42]
In August 1998 Seinfeld met Jessica Sklar at the Reebok Sports Club and they began dating. Sklar, a public relations executive for Tommy Hilfiger, had just returned from a three-week honeymoon in Italy with Eric Nederlander, a theatrical producer and scion of a theater-owning family. Sklar divorced Nederlander—she explained in a 2007 interview that they had been engaged in couples therapy sessions prior to their marriage—and married Seinfeld on December 25, 1999.[43][44] Comedian George Wallace was the best man at the wedding.[45]
After the nuptials, Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld bought Billy Joel's house in Amagansett, Long Island for US$32 million after news of the couple's interest in the property became public in 2000.[46][47]
As of January 2014, the Seinfelds raise one daughter and two sons: Daughter Sascha was born in 2000,[48] son Julian Kal was born in 2003;[49] and Shepherd Kellen was born in 2005—all in New York City, U.S.[50][51] Julian's middle name Kal is the first name of Seinfeld's father and also the first name of Seinfeld's hero Superman, aka Kal-El. Among Seinfeld's best friends are fellow comedians Wallace, Larry Miller, and Mario Joyner.[52]
In 2000, Jessica Seinfeld launched Baby Buggy, a charity that provides clothing and gear for underprivileged women and children, and she is the author of the best-seller Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food, released by HarperCollins in October 2007.[53]
Seinfeld is recorded as having made several political contributions, including George W. Bush and Al Gore's presidential campaigns in 2000, and subsequently to four Democratic Party primary candidates in 2000 and 2004.[54]
Seinfeld stated that he dabbled in Scientology during his 20s;[55] although, he says he was never in the organization.[56][57] The association came to light in 1992.[56]
A fan of the New York Mets, Seinfeld periodically calls Steve Somers' show on WFAN-AM, a sports talk radio station, as "Jerry from Queens".[58] Seinfeld called four innings of a Mets game on SportsNet New York on June 23, 2010, reuniting with analyst Keith Hernandez, who appeared in the Seinfeld two part episode, "The Boyfriend".[59]
In December 2012, Seinfeld said that he had been practicing Transcendental Meditation (TM) for 40 years. He promoted the use of the technique in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder with Bob Roth of the David Lynch Foundation in December 2012 on the Good Morning America television show,[60] and also appeared at a 2009 David Lynch Foundation benefit for TM, at which former Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr appeared.[61]
According to Forbes magazine, Seinfeld's annual earning from Seinfeld in 2004 was US$267 million, placing him at the top of the celebrity "money rank" that year.[62] He reportedly turned down US$5 million per episode, for 22 episodes, to continue the show for a tenth season.[63]
Seinfeld earned US$100 million from syndication deals and stand-up appearances in 2005 and US$60 million in 2006.[64][65] He also earned US$10 million for appearing with Bill Gates in Microsoft's 2008 advertisements for Windows.[66]
Between June 2008 and June 2009, Seinfeld earned US$85 million, making him the world's highest-paid comedian during that 12-month period.[67] In 2013, Forbes documented Seinfeld's annual income as US$32 million.[68] In mid-2013, Seinfeld disputed Forbes' claims regarding his income and net worth on the radio show of Howard Stern.[69] On 21st May 2014, with an estimated net worth of $820 million, he emerged as the wealthiest actor alive according to Forbes. [70]
Seinfeld, an automobile enthusiast and avid collector, owns a large Porsche collection.[71] He rented a hangar at the Santa Monica Airport, in Santa Monica, California, for an extended period of time during the 1990s for storage of some of the vehicles in the collection.[citation needed]
One tally[where?] has Seinfeld owning 46 Porsches.[72] Paul Bannister has written that Seinfeld's collection includes Porsche 911s from various years, 10 Porsche Boxsters each painted a different color, and the famous 1955 Porsche 550 Spyder, the same model and pearl-grey color that actor James Dean was driving when he crashed and died.[73] The Discovery Channel television show Chasing Classic Cars[which?] claims that Seinfeld owns the first and last air-cooled Porsche 911s produced. The centerpiece is a $700,000 Porsche 959, one of only 337 built. He was not allowed to drive it, due to the fact that the car was "not street-legal", which is because US emission and crash tests were never performed for the model since Porsche refused to donate four Porsche 959s for destruction tests. He imported the car "for exhibition purposes", on the stipulation that it may never be driven on US roads.[73] The car was made US street legal in 1999 under the "Show and Display" federal law.[74][75] Seinfeld wrote an article for the February 2004 issue of Automobile, reviewing the Porsche Carrera GT.[76]
In 2008, Seinfeld was involved in a car accident when the brakes on his 1966 Fiat 500 failed and—to avoid an intersection—he pulled the emergency brake while turning sharply, ultimately causing the car to come to a stop on its side. Seinfeld was unhurt.[77]

In tribute, Seinfeld appeared in an MLB Network special about the routine in July 2012. Also, as he told the NY Times, his brief comedy stand-up that used to open early episodes of Seinfeld (1989) was a homage to the comedians, as was his own playing the Abbott-like straight man to the other characters in the sitcom, as well as building on the physical contrast between Kramer's tall leanness and Newman's short chubbiness. Even more, character George Costanza's middle name, Louis, was yet another tribute to Costello's memory.

      A recent survey stated that the average person's greatest fear is having to give a speech in public. Somehow this ranked even higher than death which was third on the list. So, you're telling me that at a funeral, most people would rather be the guy in the coffin than have to stand up and give a eulogy.
      [about pregnancy and babies] It's like getting ready for your own birth. Nothing prepares you . . . When those eyes meet your eyes -- I was feeling things I never had feelings like before. I never loved anyone so much at first meeting. I love her so much! But! - Let's make no mistake why these babies come here: to replace us. Their first words are "Mama", "Dada" and "Bye-bye". We'll see who's wearing the diapers when this is all over.
      [on whether family life produces better comedy than bachelorhood ]The truth is, the family is much more creatively nourishing because you're playing on a full keyboard. Whereas when you're single, you're just playing the upbeat jazzy tunes.

      When you've been in the business 5-years, as a person, it's like you're 5-years old - like a child. 10-years and you're 10-years old, 20... Etcetera. That's how I measure maturity in this industry.
      I don't like "great" restaurants. I don't want to hear the specials. If they're so special, put 'em on the menu. I don't want any auditioning foods. When they make the real show, then I will eat them.
      Now they show you how detergents take out bloodstains - a pretty violent image there. I think if you've got a T-shirt with a bloodstain all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem. Maybe you should get rid of the body before you do the wash.
      I wanted to do an episode of my TV series which we never did where sitcom problems would crop up and then be very quickly resolved.
=======================================================
From All Movie Guide: Seemingly every struggling standup comic dreams of landing their own television series, but few managed to do so with greater success than Jerry Seinfeld, whose career as a nightclub comedian led to him starring as himself on the show Seinfeld -- arguably the most successful situation comedy of the 1990s.
Jerome "Jerry" Seinfeld was born in Brooklyn, NY, on April 29, 1954, to Kalman Seinfeld, a signmaker, and his wife, Betty; Jerry was the second of the couple's two children. The Seinfeld family moved to Long Island when Jerry was a child, and he spent most of his youth there. After graduating from high school, Seinfeld went on to college, first attending the State University of New York at Oswego, and then moving on to Queens College of the City University of New York, where he received a Bachelor's Degree in 1976. Seinfeld developed a keen interest in performing while in college (his degree from Queens was in communications and theater), and after graduation he began working New York comedy clubs, often without pay, while holding down a number of odd jobs. Seinfeld's first big break came when his bright but understated observational humor caught the eye of standup legend Rodney Dangerfield, who featured Seinfeld on a special for HBO. The exposure helped establish Seinfeld on the comedy club circuit, and won him a recurring role on the situation comedy Benson. However, Seinfeld and the show's producers clashed over the character's direction, and he was fired after only four episodes.
In 1981, Seinfeld appeared for the first time on The Tonight Show, then hosted by Johnny Carson, and made a strong impression on both the audience and the host; he became a frequent guest on the Carson show, as well as David Letterman's late-night talk show. As Seinfeld's fame began to rise, he starred in several cable TV specials, and was approached to star in several TV series. However, remembering his experience on Benson, Seinfeld opted to avoid episodic television unless he was in a position of greater control (though he did do occasional guest spots on sitcoms and played a small role in Danny De Vito's TV movie The Ratings Game). In the meantime, Seinfeld and his good friend Larry David began working up an idea for a situation comedy to be called The Seinfeld Chronicles. In 1989, NBC took the bait, and a year later the show premiered under the streamlined name Seinfeld. Concerning standup comic Jerry Seinfeld and the often odd everyday occurrences of his circle of friends (many of whom were based on people Seinfeld and David knew in real life), Seinfeld got off to a slow start, but began to win a healthy audience in its second season, and in time became one of NBC's biggest hits, until Seinfeld and David opted to end the show at the peak of its popularity in 1998. Unlike most stars of top-rated television shows, Seinfeld displayed no interest in moving into films, and instead returned to standup comedy shortly after his show went off the air with a sold-out concert tour. In the Spring of 2002, however, Seinfeld did sign a deed to appear in a documentary about his return to the comedy circuit with a new act. In 2010 Seinfeld made a high-profile return to television on NBC's The Marriage Ref -- a show that found a rotating panel of celebrities attepting to settle petty disputes between squabbling spouses -- but the show went off the air after two seasons due to poor ratings. 
In his personal life, during the height of his fame, Seinfeld was romantically linked with several women (including comic and writer Carol Leifer, fashion designer Shoshanna Lonstein, and writer Jennifer Crittenden) before marrying Jessica Sklar, a publicist who met Seinfeld only a few weeks after her marriage to Eric Nederlander in 1998. Seinfeld and Sklar wed in December of 1999, and their first child, daughter Sascha, was born on November 7, 2000. ~ Rovi

 The never-before-told story of how Jerry Seinfeld made his dream come true -- of how this very ambitious, extremely driven, compulsively perfectionistic carefully worked his way up through the knock-down-drag-out world of stand-up comedy as it began to explode in the mid-1970s, & how he went on to co-create in the late 80s what is considered to be the most successful TV sitcom in its history. From the start, Jerry has been extremely private about all aspects of his personal life. For more than a year, Oppenheimer conducted in-depth interviews with scores of Jerry s closes friends, family members, bus. assoc., lovers, & fellow comedians who spoke candidly, painting a riveting portrait of the beloved & talented comedian. B&W photos.

       Celebrity biographer Oppenheimer (Martha Stewart: Just Desserts:  The Unauthorized Biography) now turns his penetrating eye to the  notoriously private multimillionaire stand-up comic, whose  response to this salacious page-turner will probably take the  tone of his ever-popular phrase, "Hello, Newman." Oppenheimer  spares nothing and no one in this saucy expos , covering  Seinfeld's modest beginnings in Massapequa, Long Island  (Seinfeld famously quipped that the town's name is Indian for  "near the mall"), his days at SUNY Oswego and then Queens  College, his introduction to the booming 1980s comedy club scene  and his eventual launch of the most successful sitcom of the  '90s. Oppenheimer digs up sources ranging from Seinfeld's  neighbors and old classmates to rabbis, fellow comedians and, of  course, ex-girlfriends. In fact, much of the book focuses on  Seinfeld's apparent fear of commitment and his tendency to date  the same type of woman (Jewish and noticeably younger than he).  The author holds nothing back in giving the blow-by-blow of  Seinfeld's romances with a teenage Shoshanna Lonstein and,  later, freshly divorced (after a three-month marriage) Jessica  Sklar. Regarding Seinfeld's career, Oppenheimer attributes the  comic's success less to acting skills than simply a desire to be  funny. Seinfeld's first shot at stand-up (at a Manhattan club's  open mike night) was a disaster, but always the perfectionist he  persevered and eventually hit it big. Oppenheimer who has indeed  become a master of his own domain delivers a rollicking,  sensational account of this "one-time poor boy from blue-collar  Long Island who [became] very wealthy from being very funny."  Photos not seen by PW. Agent, Joni Evans. (On sale Aug. 6) Forecast: Seinfeld's 1993 autobiography, SeinLanguage, was a  bestseller. Fans of the TV show of which there are legions and  anyone looking for a juicy summer read will be all over  Oppenheimer's book like white on rice.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.
       Oppenheimer has taken on tough cookies like Barbara Walters and  Martha Stewart, so he probably won't have too much trouble with  the king of irony.   Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.

  He seems to have collected a lot of journalistic kind of history.Jazi ZilberThe author gets many insights from people close to Jerry, but one thing that he never gets is any insight from Larry David or anybody else involved with the show.D. VerbitskyHe didn't use profanity in his comedy routines and I think that was a huge part of what made Jerry Seinfeld so great.L. Sweeny
  This book had good, reliable sources, and Oppenheimer really did his homework in finding out about Mr. Seinfeld.  If you need some info about Jerry, you'll find it here if you find it anywhere...Especially since this book is written from the interesting slant of somebody who may not be so fond of Seinfeld...The only reason this book really gets a passing grade from me is that it's about Seinfeld's life...Seinfeld is a really interesting and quirky guy, so unless you try pretty hard to mess up whatever your writing about him, you'll end up with something interesting.I don't really like Oppenheimer's style--was this book rushed into stores, or what?  I counted about 15 typos, and some paragraphs were pointless and fluffy, while others condensed too much into such a small space.
  Oppenheimer takes a very cynical and negative view on Jerry and his  lifestyle but through all of it Jerry just seems to shine through and show how much of a driven and goal-oriented and aloof person Jerry really is.  Overall this book gives you insight into who Seinfeld really was.  It tries not to talk too much about the show, which is good.  You get to know Jerry's childhood, college, and stand-up friends.  The author gets many insights from people close to Jerry, but one thing that he never gets is any insight from Larry David or anybody else involved with the show.  Not talking about the show is one thing, but those people saw him everyday for nine years, yet they're not included.  A very insightful read, if not too specific (A whole chapter is devoted to Jessica Sklar and her growing up and moving and her childhood friends).
  The only reason I gave this book 2 stars is that it is about Jerry. I took it from the library because I'm a huge fan and was interested in learning more about how he came to where he is now - what I found instead were tedious details (not in a good way) from acquaintances and not much soul to the book. The book also doesn't seem to give credit to the amazingly hilarious Larry David, who is responsible for so much writing on the show. How can someone write an entire book about Seinfeld without once even speaking directly to the person you're writing about? This missing link was definitely a huge gap in the book, leaving only mundane details and a want for something authentic from Seinfeld himself.
  I bought this book for one reason and one reason only.  I wanted to get the lowdown on the "lightbulb" story...Jerry Seinfeld once sold lightbulbs over the phone.  I wanted to know what this was all about.  I knew he apologized for it years later.  The book tells all.  Jerry and his friend came up with a crazy con posing as injured war veterans.  It was disgusting and offensive.  According to the book, they would drop lightbulbs on the floor when on the phone and then cry about how hard it was getting used to their hooks.  You see, they lost their hands in combat.  See?  I told you it was offensive.This book is a little offensive.  I'm not sure whether the author likes Seinfeld or not.  He sure goes out of his way to serve us the dirt.But I liked the book.  Not a whole lot, but enough to reccomend it.  Put it this way- I liked it more than I didn't like it.Seinfeld is an immensely private man, which makes him a prime target for books like this.  But this is more than tabloid fodder.  It is focused.  It told me things I din't know before and it's pretty well researched.  That Jerry didn't cooperate, and asked others to do likewise, shows.  But for what the author had to work with, he did a fair job.
  What a boring read. For a story about a man who made his name largely from the show Seinfeld there were only 82 pages(out of 362)and 8 chapters(out of 41)related to the show. The rest was a boring soap opera about his relationships and lack of commitment in those relationships. All the information was gathered through anecdotes, largely from people Jerry had crossed in some way so they were generally not complimentary. I found the last few chapters particularly tedious telling the stories of the leaked Vanity Fair article and the "theft" of his future wife. I realise a biography needs to tell about the person outside of what has made them famous but this was over the top in that area and gave me almost no behind the scenes information about the show that most of the world loved.
  I watched his show.  I liked his offbeat humour.  Now, I find out he is, in reality, an arrogant, anal retentive person if he took pleasure in running around with another man's wife.
  A lot of information about Jerry Seinfeld the person from the people who were with him when he was off stage.
  Very good. Enjoyable  holds your attention hard to put down well written author makes you feel you know the people in the book
      The book seemed well written and it was a pretty fast read.  I myself am not a reader but I will read autobiographies from time to time.
      I question the motivation of any author who writes an unauthorized biography.  "Unauthorized" is code for vicious & mean spirited.
      The author does a pretty good job at developing a systematic and comprehensive background of Jerry Seinfeld.
      He seems to have collected a lot of journalistic kind of history.The annoying parts are:He takes a clear moral judgment against anything os seinfeld life he does...
      A really great book, I learned more than I thought I would about one of my favorite celebrities. I always wondered about the ideas for the shows and was a little surprised at his...
      Simply one of the best biographies I've ever read.  You'll get the full story of Jerry Seinfeld and see a side to him you never thought possible.
      It seems obvious that Mr. Oppenheimer is no Seinfeld fan. Facts and blatant innuendo are merged into a less than flattering portrait.
      What was the point of this biography, why was it written and why would anyone feel the need to read this book?

The funnyman who graduated from an exhausting 300 stand-up shows per year to lead George, Kramer and Elaine to comic immortality, tackling subjects from body odour to orgasms.
Jerome Allen 'Jerry' Seinfeld was born on 29 April 1954 in the borough of Brooklyn in New York City to sign maker Kalman Seinfeld and Betty, who were both of Jewish descent.He grew up in New York and studied at Massapequa high school, before volunteering for a short time in Kibbutz Sa'ar in Israel at the age of 16.Jerry Seinfeld, straight from graduating in communications and theatre at Queens College, tried out at amateur nights at New York's 'Catch a Rising Star' in 1976. Soon after, he was appearing on a Rodney Dangerfield HBO special.Seinfeld won a small reoccurring role, as Frankie, on the 'Benson' sitcom in 1979, but was abruptly fired from the show.A few years later, in May of 1981, Seinfeld made a highly successful appearance on Johnny Carson's 'Tonight Show'. Seinfeld then became a regular on similar shows, like 'Late Night with David Letterman' and the 'Merv Griffin' show.Seinfeld created 'The Seinfeld Chronicles' with Larry David in 1989, for NBC. The show was later renamed simply 'Seinfeld', and became one of the most popular and successful sitcoms on American television, until the time the show left the air in 1998.As of 2002, the show was still receiving heavy airplay in syndication. The show also starred 'Saturday Night Live' veteran, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Michael Richards, and Jason Alexander.After his sitcom went off the air, Seinfeld returned to stand-up comedy, the process of which was chronicled in a 2002 documentary, 'Comedian', directed by Christian Charles.In 2007, he turned his hand at script-writing and penned animated film 'Bee Movie'. He also voiced the main character Barry B Benson.Seinfeld was also a regular panelist on the reality show 'The Marriage Ref' in 2010 and 2011.He has written a few books, mostly archives of past stand-up routines. His most well-known publication is 'Seinlanguage', which became a New York Time's best seller in 1993. Though he has never admitted it, Seinfeld is also widely believed to be the ghost-writer of the popular 'Letters from a Nut' book series.Seinfeld met his wife Jessica Sklar, a PR executive for Tommy Hilfiger, at the Reebok Sports Club after she had returned from a honeymoon with her first husband, whom she divorced.They married on 14 November 1998. Daughter Sascha was born in 2000, followed by sons Julian Kal in 2003 and Shepherd Kellen in 2005.

Jerry SeinfeldComedianBorn: 29 April 1954Birthplace: Brooklyn, New YorkBest known as: Star of the TV sitcom SeinfeldJerry Seinfeld was already a success as a stand-up comedian when he and Larry David created the hit TV sitcom Seinfeld in 1990.  In the show, Seinfeld played a fictional version of himself: a single standup comic in New York, surrounded by offbeat friends and coping with the trivialities of modern life. (The show co-starred Michael Richards as Kramer, Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Elaine, and Jason Alexander as George Costanza.)  The show became a huge hit for NBC and for Jerry Seinfeld, who ended the show in 1998 while it was still earning some of TV's best ratings and reviews. Seinfeld wrote the comedy book Seinlanguage in 1993 and the picture book Halloween in 2002. He appeared in Comedian, a documentary about stand-up comedy, in 2002. Bee Movie, an animated feature he wrote, produced, and starred in, was released in 2007.Extra credit: Jerry Seinfeld began dating 18-year-old Shoshanna Lonstein in 1993, making him a popular topic for tabloid newspapers. Seinfeld then married the former Jessica Sklar in 1999. They have three children: Sascha (b. 2000), Julian (b. 2003) and Shepherd (b. 2005).Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC.
