Sharon Vonne Stone (born March 10, 1958) is an American actress, film producer, and former fashion model.
Stone first achieved international recognition for her role in the erotic thriller Basic Instinct by Paul Verhoeven. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Drama for her performance in Casino. She received further acclaim and Golden Globe Award nominations for her roles in The Mighty and The Muse. In 2004, Stone won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her performance in The Practice. She has also appeared in such movies as Alpha Dog, Bobby and, most recently, Lovelace.
Stone was born in Meadville, Pennsylvania. The second of four children, including older brother Mike Stone, she is the daughter of Dorothy (née Lawson), an accountant and homemaker, and Joseph William Stone II, a tool and die manufacturer and factory worker.[1][2][3] Stone was considered academically gifted as a child and entered the second grade when she was five years old.[4] She graduated from Saegertown High School in Saegertown, Pennsylvania in 1975.[3] While attending Edinboro University, Stone won the title of Miss Crawford County in Meadville, and was a candidate for Miss Pennsylvania.[3] One of the pageant judges told her to quit school and move to New York City to become a fashion model.[3] In 1977, Stone left Meadville, moving in with an aunt in New Jersey. Within four days of her arrival in New Jersey, she was signed by Ford Modeling Agency in New York.
While living in Europe, she decided to quit modeling and become an actress. "So I packed my bags, moved back to New York, and stood in line to be an extra in a Woody Allen movie," she later recalled.[5] Stone was cast for a brief role in Allen's Stardust Memories (1980),[3] and then had a speaking part a year later in the horror film Deadly Blessing (1981). French director Claude Lelouch cast her in Les Uns et les Autres (1982), starring James Caan.[6] She was on screen for two minutes and did not appear in the credits. Her next film role was in Irreconcilable Differences (1984), starring Ryan O'Neal, Shelley Long, and a young Drew Barrymore. Stone played a starlet who breaks up the marriage of a successful director and his screenwriter wife. In 1984, she appeared in a two-part episode of Magnum, P.I., titled "Echoes of the Mind", where she played identical twins, one a love interest of Tom Selleck's character. Through the rest of the 1980s, she had roles in other films such as King Solomon's Mines (1985) and Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold (1987), and played Steven Seagal's wife in Above the Law (1988). Also in 1988, Stone took over the role of Janice Henry for the filming of the miniseries War and Remembrance.
Her appearance in Dutch film director Paul Verhoeven's Total Recall (1990) with Arnold Schwarzenegger gave Stone's career a boost.[3] To coincide with the film's release, she posed nude for Playboy, showing off the muscles she developed in preparation for the film (she lifted weights and learned taekwondo). In 1999, she was rated among the 25 sexiest stars of the century by Playboy.[7] In another Verhoeven film was the role that made her a star, playing Catherine Tramell, a brilliant, bisexual, alleged serial killer, in Basic Instinct (1992).[3] Several actresses at the time turned down the role, mostly because of the nudity required.[8] In the film's most notorious scene, Tramell is being questioned by the police, and she crosses and uncrosses her legs, exposing her genitalia, which are not covered by underwear.[9] According to Stone, she agreed to film the flashing scene with no underwear, and although she and Verhoeven had discussed the scene from the beginning of production, she was unaware just how explicit the infamous shot would be:[10]
"I knew that we were going to do this leg-crossing thing and I knew that we were going to allude to the concept that I was nude, but I did not think that you would see my vagina in the scene. Later, when I saw it in the screening I was shocked. I think seeing it in a room full of strangers was so disrespectful and so shocking, so I went into the booth and slapped him and left."[11][12]
Stone claimed in an earlier interview, however, that "it was so fun" watching the film for the first time with strangers.[10] Verhoeven has denied all claims of trickery and said, "As much as I love her, I hate her, too, especially after the lies she told the press about the shot between her legs, which was a straight lie".[13] Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas, who later befriended the actress, also claimed in his memoir, Hollywood Animal, that the actress was fully aware of the level of nudity involved.
Following Basic Instinct, she was listed by People magazine as one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world.[14] In 1992, photographer George Hurrell took a series of photographs of Stone, Sherilyn Fenn, Julian Sands, Raquel Welch, Eric Roberts, and Sean Penn. In November 1995, Stone received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 6925 Hollywood Blvd. That same year, Empire chose her as one of the 100 sexiest stars in film history. In October 1997, she was ranked among the top 100 film stars of all time by Empire. In 1995, she received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Dramatic Motion Picture for her role as Ginger in Martin Scorsese's Casino, in which she starred opposite Robert De Niro.[3] She also earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for the role.[3] The same year, she starred opposite Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe, and Leonardo DiCaprio in the Sam Raimi western The Quick And The Dead. Also in 1995, she was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award.[15] Stone starred opposite Ellen DeGeneres in the 2000 HBO film If These Walls Could Talk 2, in which she played a lesbian trying to start a family. For her work on 'Walls', she was again recognized by Women in Film, this time with the Lucy Award.[15] In 2001, Stone was linked to a biopic of the German film director Leni Riefenstahl. The prospective director, Paul Verhoeven, and Riefenstahl herself, favoured Stone to portray Riefenstahl in the film. According to Verhoeven, he discussed the project with Stone and she was very interested. Subsequently, Verhoeven pulled out of the project as he wanted to hire a more expensive screenwriter than the producers did.[16][17] Stone was hospitalized on September 29, 2001 for a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which was diagnosed as a vertebral artery dissection rather than the more common ruptured aneurysm, and treated with an endovascular coil embolization.[18]
In 2003, she appeared in three episodes from the eighth season of The Practice. For her performances, she received an Emmy Award[19] for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. Also in 2003, she appeared in a James Woods-directed American Stroke Association television commercial to raise awareness of the symptoms of stroke. This commercial was also shown in Canada courtesy of the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.[20] Stone attempted a return to the mainstream with roles in the films Cold Creek Manor (2003) with Dennis Quaid and Catwoman (2004) with Halle Berry; however, both films were critical and commercial flops.
After years of litigation, Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction was released on March 31, 2006. A reason for a long delay in releasing the film was reportedly Stone's dispute with the filmmakers over the nudity in the film; she wanted more, while they wanted less. A group sex scene was cut in order to achieve an R rating from the MPAA for the U.S. release; the controversial scene remained in the U.K. version of the London-based film. Stone told an interviewer, "We are in a time of odd repression and if a popcorn movie allows us to create a platform for discussion, wouldn't that be great?"[21] Despite an estimated budget of $70 million, it placed only 10th in gross on its debut weekend with a meager $3,200,000, and was subsequently declared a bomb.[22] It ultimately ran in theaters for only 17 days and finished with a total domestic gross of under $6 million. Despite the failure of Basic Instinct 2, Stone has said that she would love to direct and act in a third Basic Instinct film.
She appeared in the 2006 drama film Alpha Dog opposite Bruce Willis, playing Olivia Mazursky, the mother of a real-life murder victim. Stone wore a fatsuit for the role.[23] In February 2007, Stone found her role as a clinically depressed woman in her latest film, When a Man Falls in the Forest, uplifting, as it challenged what she called "Prozac society." "It was a watershed experience," she said. "I think that we live in a... Prozac society where we're always told we're supposed to have this kind of equilibrium of emotion. We have all these assignments about how we're supposed to feel about something."[24]
In December 2006, she co hosted the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway together with Anjelica Huston. The concert was in honor of the Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus for his social conrtribution in Bangladesh through Grameen Bank.[25] Also in that year, she appeared in the last episode of the Turkish TV series Kurtlar Vadisi (Valley of the Wolves) along with Andy Garcia.[26] On January 5, 2010, Entertainment Weekly reported Stone's impending appearance in four episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit in April,[27] and then included in a review on the 29th of that April such descriptions of Stone's performance as a "great presence," and having "had to revive her best ... tone to sell hokey lines" in a series it described as "mawkish and overwrought."[28] Stone portrayed Jo Marlowe, a former cop turned prosecutor. Stone plays a dermatologist seeking a ménage à trois in John Turturro's Fading Gigolo, which premiered in September 2013.[29]
In 2014, Stone was cast in Agent X, a television action-drama series to air on the TNT channel. She will star as Natalie Maccabee, America's first female Vice President who takes the office after the death of her Senator husband. Her first priority is to protect the Constitution with the help of a secret operative designated "Agent X".[30]
On January 28, 2005, Stone helped solicit pledges for $1 million in five minutes for mosquito nets in Tanzania,[31] turning a panel on African poverty into an impromptu fund-raiser at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Many observers, including UNICEF, criticized her actions by claiming that Stone had reacted instinctively to the words of Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, because she had not done her research on the causes, consequences and methods of preventing malaria.[32]
Of the $1 million pledged, only $250,000 was actually raised. In order to fulfill the promise to send $1 million worth of bed nets to Tanzania, UNICEF contributed $750,000.[33] This diverted funds from other UNICEF projects.[33] According to prominent economist Xavier Sala-i-Martín, officials are largely unaware of what happened with the bed nets. Some were delivered to the local airport.[33] These reportedly were stolen and later resurfaced as wedding dresses on the local black market.[32][33]
Stone was criticized over her comments in an exchange on the red carpet with Hong Kong's Cable Entertainment News during the 61st Annual Cannes Film Festival on May 25, 2008. When asked about the 2008 Sichuan earthquake she remarked:
Well you know it was very interesting because at first, you know, I'm not happy about the way the Chinese are treating the Tibetans because I don't think anyone should be unkind to anyone else. And so I have been very concerned about how to think and what to do about that because I don't like that. And I had been this, you know, concerned about, oh how should we deal with the Olympics because they are not being nice to the Dalai Lama, who is a good friend of mine. And then this earthquake and all this stuff happened, and then I thought, is that Karma? When you're not nice then the bad things happen to you? [34]
One of China's biggest cinema chains reacted to Stone's comments by declaring it would not show her films in its theaters.[35] The founder of the UME Cineplex chain and the chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Filmmakers, Ng See-Yuen, called Stone's comments "inappropriate," and said the UME Cineplex chain would be presenting her films no further.[35] Christian Dior advertisements featuring Stone's image were dropped from all ads in China amid the public uproar.[36] Stone was removed from the 2008 Shanghai International Film Festival guest list, and the event's organizers considered banning the actress permanently.[37]
Dior China had originally posted an apology in Stone's name, but Stone later denied making the apology during an interview with the New York Times, saying "I'm not going to apologize. I'm certainly not going to apologize for something that isn't real and true – not for face creams," although she does admit she had "sounded like an idiot."[38] However, after the interview, Stone released a statement entitled "In my own words by Sharon Stone" in which she said "I could not be more regretful of that mistake. It was unintentional. I apologize. Those words were never meant to be hurtful to anyone."[39] While Stone cited the Dalai Lama as her "good friend" when she made the remark at the Cannes film festival, the Dalai Lama has reportedly distanced himself by saying of her only, "yes, I've met that lady".[40][41]
For many years, Stone maintained that she had an IQ of 148[42] and was a member of Mensa,[43][44] but in April 2002, she admitted she was not, and had never been, a member of that society.[43][45] Jim Blackmore of Mensa said, "It's delightful to finally see Ms. Stone admit that she's not and never has been a member of our society." Blackmore admits Stone may be as clever as many like to think. He says, "My gut feeling is that she would definitely qualify. But that's just based on what we've been told by other individuals."[45]
In March 2006, Stone traveled to Israel to promote peace in the Middle East through a press conference with Nobel Peace Prize winner Shimon Peres.[46] In 2013, she referred to Peres as her "mentor".[47] On October 23, 2013, Stone received the Peace Summit Award for her work with HIV/AIDS sufferers.[48]
Stone currently lives in Beverly Hills, California and owns a ranch in New Zealand.[49] She married television producer Michael Greenburg in 1984 on the set of The Vegas Strip War, a television film he produced and she starred in. The couple separated three years later, and their divorce was finalized in 1990.[50] In 1993, Stone met William J. MacDonald (aka Bill MacDonald) on the set of the film Sliver, which he co-produced. MacDonald left his wife Naomi Baca for Stone and became engaged to her. They separated one year later in 1994.[51] While working on the film The Quick and the Dead in 1995, Stone met Bob Wagner (a second assistant director) and they became engaged. After they separated, Stone returned the engagement ring via FedEx.[52]
On February 14, 1998, Stone married Phil Bronstein, executive editor of the San Francisco Examiner and later San Francisco Chronicle.[53] They adopted a baby son, Roan Joseph Bronstein, in 2000.[54] Bronstein filed for divorce in 2003, citing irreconcilable differences.[55] The divorce became final in 2004,[56] with a judge ruling that Roan should remain primarily with Bronstein, with Stone receiving visitation.[55][57] Stone adopted her second son, Laird Vonne Stone, in 2005,[58] and her third son, Quinn Kelly Stone, in 2006.[50][59]
In 2005, when asked during a television interview for her film Basic Instinct 2 about "life imitating art" (referring to her character's bisexuality), Stone said, "Why not? Middle age is an open-minded period".[60] In 2011, Stone stated on Piers Morgan Tonight that she was never married to George Howe Englund, Jr., despite contrary internet rumors.[61]
It was announced on January 30, 2013 that Stone had split with her boyfriend Martin Mica after dating for eight months.[62]
Stone is a convert to Tibetan Buddhism.[63] She believes in God and is religious by self-description.[64] She is an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church.[65]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Sharon Stone was born and raised in Meadville, a small town in Pennsylvania. Her strict father was a factory worker and her mother was an accountant and homemaker. She was the second of four children. At the age of 15, she studied in Saegertown High School, Pennsylvania and, at that same age, entered Edinboro State University of Pennsylvania, and graduated with a degree in creative writing and fine arts. She was a very smart girl, became a bookworm, and once was told that a suitable job for her (and her brains) was to become a lawyer. However, her first love was still the black-and-white movies, especially those featuring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. So, the 17-year-old Sharon got herself into the Miss Crawford County beauty contest and won it. From working part-time as a McDonald's counter girl, she worked her way up to become a successful Ford model, both in TV commercials and print ads. In 1980, she made her film debut as an extra in Woody Allen's Stardust Memories (1980). Her first speaking part was in Wes Craven's horror movie, Deadly Blessing (1981). She struggled through many parts in B-movies, such as King Solomon's Mines (1985) and Action Jackson (1988). She was also married in 1984 to Michael Greenburg, the producer of MacGyver (1985), but they divorced two years later. She finally got her big break with a memorable supporting role in the popular Arnold Schwarzenegger movie Total Recall (1990), and also posed nude for Playboy, a daring move for a 32-year-old actress. But it worked; she was cast in the breakthrough role as a sociopath novelist, "Catherine Tramell", in Basic Instinct (1992). Her interrogation scene has become a classic in film history and her performance captivated everyone, from MTV viewers, who honored her with Most Desirable Female and Best Female Performance Awards, to a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. After she got famous, she didn't want to be typecast, so she played a victim in Sliver (1993), and, in Intersection (1994), she was the aloof, estranged wife of Richard Gere. Afterwards, so she got herself again into more aggressive roles, such as The Specialist (1994) with Sylvester Stallone and The Quick and the Dead (1995) with Gene Hackman. But, it wasn't until she played a beautiful but drug-crazy trophy wife of Robert De Niro in Casino (1995) that she got far more than just fame and fortune--she also received the acknowledgment of the movie industry for her acting ability. She received her first Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination. She did a couple films after wards, teaming up with Isabelle Adjani in Diabolique (1996), and as a woman waiting for her death penalty in Last Dance (1996). In 1998, she married a newspaper editor, Phil Bronstein. That year she also starred in the sci-fi thriller Sphere (1998) and received her third Golden Globe nomination for The Mighty (1998), a film that her company, "Chaos", also co-executive produced. The next year, she played the title role in Gloria (1999) and entered her first comedic role in The Muse (1999), which gave her another Golden Globe nomination. Sharon Stone, a diva who thoroughly enjoys her hard-won stardom, is now a mother of an adorable baby boy, Roan Joseph.

      I was, like, forty at birth. When I wasn't even a year old, I spoke, I was potty trained, I walked and talked. That was it. Then I started school and drove everybody crazy because they realized I had popped out as an adult. I had adult questions and wanted adult answers.

      It's traumatizing for me to come to Washington during a Republican administration because I don't have any Republican clothes. - Washington Post, June 20, 2001.
      Never play cards with a guy named Doc. Never eat at a place called Mom's. And never have sex with anybody who has more problems than you do.
      "It was my first movie (Stardust Memories (1980)) and the opportunity of working with Woody Allen. It was a great experience, and I can compare it, in sexual terms, with the loss of virginity".
      Asked to pay tribute to troops fighting in Iraq: "I know it's a difficult time for you to come out to party during such a time of strife in our world. My feeling is that I hope everyone will be safe and protected and taken care of, and our prayers are with the people around the world who will be affected by this."
      Stone found her brush with death from a brain aneurysm has given her a new lease of life: "This brilliant, bright, white vortex of light was upon me. And then I was met by some of my friends, people who are very dear to me. But it was over very fast and suddenly I was back in the room and in my own body. It affected me so profoundly that I realized my life would never be the same again. It has definitely given me a new perspective on my career."
Ava Gardner was the most beautiful woman in the world, and it's wonderful that she didn't cut up her face. She addressed aging by picking up her chin and receiving the light in a better way. And she looked like a woman. She never tried to look like a girl.

      I believe that if you truly, truly love your children, you need to supply condoms in a place in your home, at a quantity that makes it a non-judgmental situation for them to have them... If they want to make water balloons out of them, great. If they want to carry them so they feel tough, great. If they want to give them to their friends, even better.
Carole Lombard, Clark Gable, Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire - that was my idea of what it was supposed to be like. I thought, 'Well, I can do that even if no one else does.' Who cares? I dress up to show that I am happy and grateful to be there. That's what you do where I come from. I don't feel like saying, 'fuck you.' I feel like saying, 'thank you.'
      I thought when I made my first big mistakes in public that that was really going to be the end of me. My parents cried. My friends were desperate.
      On fame: "It would walk into the room and eat you, or take you for a ride through a fabulous jungle - or it could slap the living daylights out of you, laugh, and leave."
      "After you've been through all that stuff, the rest of this is just kid's stuff. As Winston Churchill says, when you're going through hell, keep going".
      People get very hung up on whether they gave birth. ... I've come to understand that it's not who 'has' you, but who loves you that shapes you as a person.
      I'm more honest, more true, more vulnerable because I used to think that I was supposed to be fearless. Now I know that its okay to be afraid as long as you show up.
      Celebrity is a pretty stunning thing. At first I was like 'They love me! Oh, I love them, too!' And suddenly, I was tap-dancing on my pedestal and it was WHACK! Facedown in the dirt.
      [Talking about Basic Instinct 2 (2006)]: "By the time the film is released, I will be 48 and I wanted to do the nudity in a way that's quite brazen. I wanted her to be very masculine, like a man in a steam room and I wanted the audience to have a moment where they realize she's naked and then realize that she's a forty something woman and naked. Because we're not used to seeing that in movies. We're used to seeing Sean Connery and his granddaughter, you know what I mean? Or Mel Gibson and his daughter".
      My mother gave me a jar of Avon Rich Moisture Cream when I was 14. She said, 'Don't ask me why; you'll thank me later.'-Woman's World, 4-11-06.
      In this business there is Plan A, in which you become successful by living and acting with a lot of integrity. Then there's Plan B, where you sell your soul to the Devil. I still find it hard to distinguish one from the other.
      I've really given up my life to God, and I know that's why I'm OK and at peace. I've never had a conflict when I'm praying on a set.
      I've been at this so long that I knew everyone in the business long before I became famous, and I didn't have any value to many of them. Now, suddenly, the people who were coarse and rude to me before treat me as though we've never met, and now I'm fabulous, they're fabulous and isn't it fabulous we're chatting.
      My children need to have someone they can look up to, someone they can look at and say, Gee, I'd like to be just like him, So I don't want to just bring some schmuck around them. When I meet people I have to think about are they going to be a good example for my sons.
      For the first half of your life, you get the face that you're born with. And for the second half you get the face you deserve. And it's important to recognize the beauty within you and allow it to grow by being the greater person that you can be.
      People are just sitting there going, 'I don't care what she's saying, I just want to know does she get naked in the movie? Is she naked? Nude nude nude naked, do I see her boobies?'-during a Basic Instinct 2 (2006) press conference.
      At 47, you have thoughtfulness and dignity and spiritual elegance...You have something to say. It's not just, Hi! I look terrific in a bathing suit.'
      When you've had a long career, nobody has not made movies that aren't successful, it's your job, not a hobby.
      Being professional in what I do is very important to me. Flakes don't make it to the top, pros do. Acting is a tough scene that becomes your whole life and to survive in that kind of environment you must be humane and honest.
      I was this cute young girl with a nice ass who was a terrible actress. But I've worked real hard to become a good actress and now I think I'm starting to reap the benefits of that hard work. (from a 1990 interview)
      I feel at great pain when the spotlight is on the death of 4,000 American soldiers, while 600,000 Iraqi deaths are ignored. War is not a movie, it is a tragedy of dead bodies, victims, the disabled, orphans, widows and the displaced. I feel sad when I realize how much truth is being changed or obscured in the American media.
      [2004] I suppose there was a time when I ran my celebrity like a business-but those days are over. I had a marvelous time doing all the great "Sharon Stone" things, and I love being an actor, loved achieving in that world, but I don't really feel the need now to stand in the line going "pick me, pick me!" anymore. "Sharon Stone" was one of the things that I did, but I don't think it's the only thing that I'm ever GONNA do or the only thing I ever WANT to do.
      [on what three things should a movie star have] An unknown address, friends they knew before they were famous, and people who love them enough to tell them they're full of shit.
      I feel that it's so disappointing in films when you see the comforter taped to someone's chest. It takes you out of the scene and doesn't protect you from something within the scene.
      When it has common sense it doesn't make sense to do something else. It really is the costume of your character. What else are you gonna do? It seems foolish to do something else and if you do something else, that distracts the audience if you're in authentic.

=======================================================
 Sharon Stone was born in 1958 in Meadville Pensylvannia as a second child of her parents. Her father was a colourman and her mother worked as an accountant. Sharon studied creative writing and fine arts at Edinboro State University of Pennsylvania. When she was seventeen she won title "Miss of Pensylvanny". Two years later she began succesfuly career as a model in New York. She worked for Eileen Ford's model agency. She posed also for magazines like Vogue and Elle and we can find her naked in Playboy too.
        Sharon's first role was in Woody Allen's Stardust Memories when she was 22 years old. But then things slowed down. Sharon played in movies like Action Jackson, Cold Steel and Police Academy 4 and also in some TV serials like Bay City Blues. In 1984 Sharon got married for the first time with Michael Greenburg. For the change in her carrer Sharon had to wait 10 long years. And then came Total Recall, where Sharon played the best of her action role as a Lori, the Arnold Schwarzenegger's wife. 
But real upturn came in 1992 with a great movie Basic Instinct. Her role of sexually voracious crime writer made from her one of the biggest star in Hollywood and established her as a sexual symbol. In Basic Instinct Sharon revealed to the world one more thing: there was nothing between her and her tight dress. In a more conventionally sympathetic role, Stone followed up with another sizzling sex melodrama, Sliver (1993), which did middling business stateside but proved a solid success overseas. On the set of this movie (Sliver) Sharon met a producer Bill McDonald. They were engaged to be married for some time. 
        She again flexed her international box-office clout paired with Sylvester Stallone in the explosive actioner The Specialist (1994) but fared much less well commercially with her next project, The Quick and the Dead (1995), which marked her producing debut. Stone looked terrific in Western duds playing something of a distaff version of a Clint Eastwood-like gunfighter. Her directorial choice, Sam Raimi, helmed the smartly derivative tale with style to spare but the critical reception was uneven and the domestic take pathetic. In 1995 she got part in Scorsese's Casino. For this role she was awarded by Golden Globe and was nominated for Oscar. Her next character part was in Last Dance, where Sharon played a woman in prison waiting for the execution. In Sphere she played beside Dustin Hoffman. Her newest movies are Gloria, The Mighty and The Muse. 
        Sphere was released on Valentine's weekend, coincided with Sharon's marriage to San Francisco newspaper editor Phil Bronstein. They are together still happy and in Spring 2000 they adopted a child. Their son is called Roan Joseph Bronstein and was born to Texas teenagers on May 22 2000. And please remember, Sharon isn't only blonde beauty, she is also very clever with IQ 154. And what can we wish to Sharon in her future life? Just only the greatest movies and happy marriage. 
Screen siren, opinionated diva, and one of the few actresses in Hollywood who can claim to be both a Paul Verhoeven muse and a MENSA member, Sharon Stone is nothing if not a legend in her own right. Beginning with her notorious disinclination to wear underwear during a police interrogation in Basic Instinct, Sharon Stone went on to become one of the most talked about actresses of the '90s, earning both admiration and infamy for her on- and off-screen personae.
                                Almost as famous as Sharon Stone's glamorous image are her working-class roots. Born in the Northwest Pennsylvania town of Meadville on March 10, 1958, Sharon grew up a bookworm in a large family. Highly intelligent in addition to being a local beauty pageant queen, she won a scholarship to Pennsylvania's Edinboro University when she was 15 years old. After studying creative writing and fine arts, she decided to pursue a modeling career, and after moving to New York, she signed on with the Eileen Ford agency. Sharon became a successful model by the late '70s, appearing in print and television ads for Clairol, Revlon, and Diet Coke.
In 1980, Stone branched out into acting, making her screen debut as the "pretty girl on train" in Woody Allen's Stardust Memories. Following this role, she spent the '80s appearing in one forgettable film after another, often cast as the stereotypical blonde bimbo. She finally got a break in 1990, when she appeared as Arnold Schwarzenegger's kickboxing secret-agent wife in Verhoeven's Total Recall. Any recognition she gained for that role, however, was more than eclipsed by the notoriety she earned for her starring turn in her second Verhoeven feature, Basic Instinct. The 1992 film, in which Stone portrayed a bisexual author/sexual adventurer who may or may not be a serial killer, did her a huge favor by making her a star but also a sizable disservice by further typecasting her in blonde seductress roles. Stone's subsequent effort, the erotic thriller Sliver (1993), was an example of this: the actress attracted notice less for her acting than for her willingness to simulate masturbation. Her role in the following year's The Specialist was also fairly limiting -- an action flick co-starring Sylvester Stallone, it called for Stone to run around in a tight dress in heels when she wasn't seducing various characters.
In 1995, Stone managed to break into the "serious actress" arena with her performance in Martin Scorsese's Casino. Cast as an ex-prostitute, she won an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe for her work, as well as the general opinion that she was capable of dramatic acting. Stone branched out further that same year with The Quick and the Dead, a revisionist Western directed by Sam Raimi in which she starred as a tough-talking, hard-drinking broad bent on revenge. Unfortunately, the film was a relative flop, as were here subsequent 1996 films, Diabolique, a remake of the 1954 French film and Last Dance, a drama that featured Stone as a woman on death row. 
By this point winning more notice for her off-screen role as an arbiter of fashion and old-school Hollywood glamour than for her onscreen acting work, Stone next lent her voice to the animated Antz in 1998. The film proved to be a success, unlike the actress's other projects that year, the sci-fi thriller Sphere and The Mighty. The latter film, which Stone produced as well as starred in, was a heartfelt story about two adolescent misfits; although it did win a number of positive reviews, audiences largely stayed away from it. The same couldn't be said of Stone's next film, a 1999 remake of Gloria; not only did audiences stay away from it, critics savaged it with vituperative glee. Never one to let a bad review get her down, Stone soon rebounded, receiving a more positive reception for her performance in The Muse and then starring as Jeff Bridges' long-suffering wife in Simpatico. If her roles in the years that followed weren't as high profile, that's certainly not to say that they were any less challenging. After taking a turn towards the small screen in the lesbian-themed made-for-cable drama If These Walls Could Talk 2, Stone broke for comedy with Alfonso Arau's Picking Up the Pieces and essayed the role of an unpredictable bad girl in Beautiful Joe (all 2000). Having veered increasingly towards family-oriented fare in recent years, the trend continued with vocal work for Harold and the Purple Crayon. Of course, all was not child's play in Stone's career, and with the release of Cold Creek Manor the following year, audiences were indeed in for a frightful chill. 
In 2004, Stone appeared opposite Halle Berry in the eagerly anticipated Catwoman, and despite a confession that she was toning down her oft cited diva-like ways after suffering a brain aneurysm in 2001, rumors of outrageous behavior on the film's set continued to circulate. By the time the film was released though, the only thing anyone was talking about was its abysmal failure at the box office and the nearly across-the-board negative reviews from critics. ~ Rebecca Flint, All Movie Guide 
This former beauty pageant contestant and Ford model made her film debut with a non-speaking part as a beautiful woman fleetingly glimpsed from a moving train in Woody Allen's Stardust Memories (1980), and thereafter clawed her way to a stardom that has brought back an old-fashioned, high-octane glamour to the role of "movie star." Sharon Stone, who grew up a bookworm in a large family in Northwest Pennsylvania, worked her way up from McDonald's counter-girl to successful Ford model (both in print ads and TV commercials) by the late 1970s.
Through the 1980s, Stone appeared as a stereotypical blonde in mostly forgettable roles: in Wes Craven's Deadly Blessing (1981); as a down-and-out waitress turned petulant movie star in Irreconcilable Differences (1984); an archaeologist's daughter in King Solomon's Mines (1985) and its sequel, Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold (1987). Other unmemorable early credits include Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol (1987), Action Jackson (1988) and the umpteenth remake of Blood and Sand (1989).
Stone also struggled in TV, beginning with a tiny part in "Not Just Another Affair" (CBS, 1982), the short-lived series Bay City Blues (NBC, 1983) and gradually bigger (though not better) roles in the TV movies "Calendar Girl Murders" (ABC, 1984), "The Vegas Strip War" (NBC, 1984), the failed cop-show pilot "Hollywood Starr" (ABC, 1985), "Mr. and Mrs. Ryan" (ABC, 1986), "Badlands 2005" (ABC, 1988) and "Tears in the Rain" (Showtime, 1988). Probably her only TV success was a supporting role as Robert Mitchum's daughter-in-law in the epic miniseries War and Remembrance (ABC, 1988-89).
Stone's first real break was playing Arnold Schwarzenegger's kick-boxing, secret agent "wife" in Paul Verhoeven's sci-fi actioner Total Recall (1990). After five more forgettable thrillers and comedies, she finally achieved the proverbial "overnight" stardom as a sexually voracious crime writer opposite Michael Douglas in Verhoeven's controversial and popular erotic thriller, Basic Instinct (1992). Her pantie-less leg-crossing scene brought Stone much-needed notoriety, but has haunted her ever since.
In a more conventionally sympathetic role, Stone followed up with another sizzling sex melodrama, Sliver (1993), which did middling business stateside but proved a solid success overseas. Trying to escape the sex-bomb trap, she begged for the frigid wife role in Intersection (1994), which met with limited success. She again flexed her international box-office clout paired with Sylvester Stallone in the explosive actioner The Specialist (1994) but fared much less well commercially with her next project, The Quick and the Dead (1995), which marked her producing debut. Stone looked terrific in Western duds playing something of a distaff version of a Clint Eastwood-like gunfighter. Her directorial choice, Sam Raimi, helmed the smartly derivative tale with style to spare but the critical reception was uneven and the public stayed away. She rebounded with her widely acclaimed performance as Ginger, the Vegas hustler who wins the heart of Robert De Niro, in Casino (also 1995).
The highly-paid, much-in-demand star (she has her own production company, Chaos, and has signed a first-look deal with Miramax) next filmed a remake of the noir classic Diabolique with Isabelle Adjani and Chazz Palmentieri and played a death-row inmate whose lawyer (Rob Morrow) works to save her from execution in Last Dance (both 1996). Stone, a diva who thoroughly enjoys her hard-won stardom, is a clever manipulator of her public image—on heavy press days, she reportedly changes outfits between each interview and photo session, a practice unheard of since the days of Joan Crawford and Norma Shearer. She lives, fittingly enough, in a gated French chateau in Beverly Hills.
BIRTH PLACE: Meadville, USA. The daughter of working-class parents in a North Pennsylvania town, American actress Sharon Stone was both the recipient of a scholarship to Penn State’s Edinboro University and a winner of local beauty pageants. 
Studying fine arts and creative writing, Stone began a successful modelling career in the late 1970s, becoming the face of Diet Coke, Revlon and Clairol. 
Starting with a small role in Woody Allen’s ‘Stardust Memories’ in 1980, Stone took some time to escape "blonde-bimbo" typecasting. 
Her break arrived in 1990, when she starred opposite Arnold Swarzenegger in ‘Total Recall’. However, it was her role in ‘Basic Instinct’, two years later, that truly made her a star. 
In the 1992 film, Stone played a bisexual nymphet and alleged serial killer, and caused outrage with her infamous ‘no-knickers’ police interrogation scene. 
However, she soon found herself typecast, with films such as ‘Slivers’ and ‘The Specialist’ mining her erotic reputation, and not much else. 
It was not until 1995, and Stone’s role in Martin Scorsese’s ‘Casino’, that she began to be recognised for her acting skills alone. She won an Oscar-nomination, as well as a Golden Globe, for the role.
Subsequent outings including the futuristic western ‘The Quick and the Dead’, the remake ‘Diabolique’ and ‘Last Dance’, but all were relative box-office flops. 
Whilst gaining an enviable reputation for off-screen glamour and opinionated wit, her screen career was not in great shape. Voicing the animated feature ‘Antz’ was a good move, but films such as ‘The Mighty’ and ‘Sphere’, while warmly received, were further popular failures.
In 1999, she appeared in a remake of ‘Gloria’, which received the worst reviews of her career, from which she has still to bounce back, despite stronger showings in ‘The Muse’, and, opposite Jeff Bridges, in ‘Simpatico’. ~ Courtesy of SkyMovies.com

                From New York modelling to Police Academy flops and finally Hollywood recognition, this actress had more than enough basic instinct, and talent, to succeed. The daughter of working-class parents in a North Pennsylvania town, American actress Sharon Stone was both the recipient of a scholarship to Penn State’s Edinboro University and a winner of local beauty pageants. Studying fine arts and creative writing, Stone began a successful modelling career in the late 1970s, becoming the face of Diet Coke, Revlon and Clairol. Starting with a small role in Woody Allen’s ‘Stardust Memories’ in 1980, Stone took some time to escape "blonde-bimbo" typecasting. Her break arrived in 1990, when she starred opposite Arnold Swarzenegger in ‘Total Recall’. However, it was her role in ‘Basic Instinct’, two years later, that truly made her a star. In the 1992 film, Stone played a bisexual nymphet and alleged serial killer, and caused outrage with her infamous ‘no-knickers’ police interrogation scene. She soon found herself typecast, with films such as ‘Slivers’ and ‘The Specialist’ mining her erotic reputation, and not much else. It was not until 1995, and Stone’s role in Martin Scorsese’s ‘Casino’, that she began to be recognised for her acting skills alone. She won an Oscar-nomination, as well as a Golden Globe, for the role. Subsequent outings including the futuristic western ‘The Quick and the Dead’ (1994), which earned her a Saturn Award for Best Actress nomination, the remake ‘Diabolique’ (1996) and ‘Last Dance’ (1996) followed, but all were relative box-office flops. Whilst gaining an enviable reputation for off-screen glamour and opinionated wit, her screen career was not in great shape. Voicing the animated feature ‘Antz’ was a good move, but films such as ‘The Mighty’ and ‘Sphere’, while warmly received, were further popular failures. In 1999, she appeared in a remake of ‘Gloria’, which received the worst reviews of her career, from which she has still to bounce back, despite stronger showings in ‘The Muse’, and, opposite Jeff Bridges, in ‘Simpatico’ (1999). Stone kicked off the new century with ‘If These Walls Could Talk 2’, an Emmy Award-winning 2000 television movie that explored the lives of three lesbian couples in three different time periods. She followed this up with a role as a narrator in the TV series ‘Harold and the Purple Crayon’, which ran between 2001 and 2002, and 2003's ‘Cold Creek Manor’. Between 2004 and 2005, Stone was credited with appearing in seven films and television series, including Turkish TV serial ‘Kurtlar Vadisi’, ‘The Practice’, ‘Broken Flowers’, ‘Catwoman’ and ‘Will & Grace’, but she still failed to achieve her previous success. Even a sequel to ‘Basic Instinct’ released in 2006 failed to return her to her former glory as the movie became a commercial flop. Despite her lack of success on the silver screen, Stone continued to land roles and went on to star in the likes of ‘When a Man Falls in the Forest’ (2007), ‘Five Dollars a Day’ (2008) and four episodes in ‘Law & Order: Special Victims Unit’ (2010). The elusive screen success did not spare her personal life either as Stone's marriages to George Englund Jr, Michael Greenburg and Phil Bronstein all ended in divorce. Stone, who has type 1 diabetes, is also a Buddhist.

I think Sharon and Stallone look like a great couple to me in the movie specialist they are perfect for each other in real life ;)))
She's very old now 55 years old woow still in good shape but I prefer her since she was younger and health and very good looking woman :)))
I love her because she's very sensible,intelligence,tall, very handsome,she's got beautiful eyes and the body very extremely attractive. I love her in the late 80s and early 90s she was good looking then now. Now she is not all that good looking then she used to do from so many years ago :)))

The first movie I saw her in was Total Recall.  I've loved her work ever since and she's incredibly hot.
She looks amazing. I just wish she would not talk so much. Not the most educated actress in Hollywood. Lots of times she fibs or makes no sense at all.
What I would like to know is what Sharon Stone has got that makes Iranian guys go nuts for her. Too bad they don`t say whether they`re Shias or Sunnis.
Is there anything `not-hot` about `doctor` Sharon? She`s kept me alive now for years! C`mon 2 my house! C`mon, c`mon.....hot. Oscar will follow VERY SOON, doc!
I Don`t Like You/Sharon! You broke up my friends marriage! It`s been too many years... Do you remember Roy March?
