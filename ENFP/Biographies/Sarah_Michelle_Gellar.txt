      The Burger King commercial she did in 1982 was the first commercial to ever mention a competitor by name. Consequently, McDonald's sued her as well as Burger King. She also couldn't enter a McDonald's unless she was in disguise due to truth in advertising ("I only eat at Burger King" was one of her lines in the commercial).

      Ever since playing the title role in Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997), she has had a reputation as a "stickler" for on-the-set safety. This showed when Charles Cyphers guest-starred in an episode of BTVS: while filming, he accidentally got hit on the head with a piece of pipe.

      [about her father] Just because you donate sperm does not make you a father. I don't have a father. I would never give him the credit or acknowledge him as my father.
      [High school] My biggest complaint is school when it's Send-the-roses day. Somebody's always left out. I always got roses, but I would give them to someone who hadn't gotten any.
      [Horror Movies] I'm always the one who gets killed. And I want it to be really gory. Body parts all over the place. Mangled!
      [on Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon]: "They're unbelievable. They're an inspiration to young love."
      [on job pressures] There's so much pressure on all of us right now. On Katie Holmes, on James Van Der Beek and myself, to do these movies, and do as much as you can because there is the slight feeling that one day your phone will stop ringing. It's not about the craft, per se. It's so easy to fall for it all because people remind you constantly that as fast as it comes, it can go. And I think there is this sort of paranoia, this need to keep working. And I know that I felt it, and for the first three years of the show, I never had more than a week off, except for Christmas. That was it.
      [on being 'skinny'] How can women be as thin as we are? We have personal trainers to work us out. We have specially prepared meals.
      [on the Internet] I got a computer and I'm learning how to use it. I collect antique books, so I used it to get my copy of 'Les Liaisons Dangereuses,' and I use it for travel, to look up customs. I went to Fiji, and I looked up all this stuff before I went, like 'Don't wear a hat in someone's house because it's rude, and don't wear shoes.' You've got to think there's something better I can do with my time than log on to the Internet and say, 'Ooo, let's find out about me!' I think that would frighten me a little bit.
      [on what the word "feminist" means] I don't call myself a feminist because feminism has a negative connotation. It makes you think of women who don't shave their legs. But feminism is not just about not being weak. It's about being able to take care of yourself. Just because you might care about what you look like or what the opposite sex thinks of you, it doesn't make you not a feminist, although it's a word I hate. Do I consider myself a strong female individual? Uh-huh. Can I take care of myself? Yes.
      [on her kissing scene with Selma Blair in Cruel Intentions (1999)] It was a great kiss. It even had a saliva trail.
      One of the greatest gifts my job has given me is that my mother, who gave up her entire life for me, doesn't have to work any more. I'm now in a position to repay her for her devotion.
      [on posing nude] Right now I can't picture posing, but I don't believe in saying never... There might be a time when I got pregnant and felt really beautiful and wanted to have a nude picture.
      [on what she would do if she wasn't acting] I would go to college to be a journalist. I always wanted to write for Time or Newsweek.
      I don't understand why James Bond has to be a man all the time. When Pierce Brosnan retires, why not one of us?
      [on why she was happy to get married:] I'm so grateful I don't have to go looking for a man on a Saturday night. I was always terrible at chatting up men. [December 10, 2003]
      [about Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997)] To me, the scariest elements of horror films are the things that could really happen. And what is more scary than high school? ... What I like about the show is that it reminds you it's O.K. to be different. What people think isn't necessarily true. If people walk away with half of that, we've done our job. [New York Times, April 27, 1997]
      [on playing Kendall Hart on All My Children (1970)] I seduced my stepfather, and when he wouldn't sleep with me, I slept with the stable boy, cried rape, and my mother stabbed him with a letter opener. Then I went to jail for perjury, burned my parents' divorce papers, and locked up my little sister. I think that was all in the first week. [New York Times, April 27, 1997]
      [on attending the Professional Children's High School in Manhattan] Everybody there had a talent, and everyone was respected. If somebody didn't like you -- they didn't talk to you! They didn't make fun of you, punish you. You could, you know, mess around with how you dress. You really had that chance to find yourself, and I thank God for that school. I went to that school feeling amazingly untalented. That school was my lifeline. Let me tell you something -- talent night at our school? There was nothing like it.
      Horror films are where women can shine and have a chance to lead. They always save the day in these films.
      [on gay marriage] I have good friends, gay couples, who've been together for 18 years. It drives me crazy that in the eyes of the law, their love isn't acknowledged when I have girlfriends who have married four times by the age of 25.
      No, that's what bothers me. That's how they think. Okay, this is a summer...I remember that it used to be you could see great movies any time. Now it's like summer is for blockbusters, fall is for the movies that they can't fit into any other time, that's like September. Then Oscar movies start, it used to be post Thanksgiving. Now the awards are earlier so it starts earlier. January is when they dump movies. And it's just so... it seems to me so obvious that wouldn't it be better for the marketplace to have these movies spread out? Not just people don't only go to the movies in summer time. If that was the truth, then in the summer time they would count the whole week's worth of the box office but it's still only a weekend. So why does it matter...sorry, I get a little upset. It's just frustrating.
      Basically I only like to choose films that I don't understand. As long as they're greater than my mental capacity, I figure I gotta be doing something artful, right? Isn't that what makes something art when you don't understand it?
      I wish, and I wish so much for the film industry right now. I wish so much for originality and I wish so much and I think that we're caught in this difficult cycle right now because our studios are corporations now. I keep talking about the old 1940s, where one guy with a cigar and a scotch made decisions for a studio and now, because there are all these computer corporations basically, technology companies and there's so much else that goes into a decision that it's very difficult to get films that are different, that are off the beaten path, made. It's much easier to get something unoriginal made than to get something original.
      "Simply Irresistible (1999) was just a bad choice - and for that it was a great learning experience. I wasn't ready to make that movie. I was too young. The script was not ready. I knew in my heart before I left to make it that I should back out".
      [on how she would like Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997) and her work on it to be remembered] I hope positively. One thing about the show was it was never categorized. It was drama, comedy, action, horror, all of those things combined. And I just want people to remember it as a fabulous run, a fabulous seven years.
      In this day and age, everything is so cross-marketed that the lines have blurred, in my opinion, between what is an actor and what is a celebrity. What is reality? All you have to do is pick up a magazine or turn on the television and you can get ideas from places that five years ago you couldn't.
      [Working in LA filming Southland Tales (2006)] That's so weird. It's one of those things that's like you go on location and you're there for a week getting ready. Here it's like you're walking the dog, you're paying the bills and then 10 minutes later, you have to go to work. It's a very sort of odd- - I'm grateful for it and so glad to actually film a movie in Hollywood. Although some of these locations are pretty far. I could probably fly to some of them.
      [on her doing movies and Freddie Prinze Jr. doing his show] It's funny in the sense of he'll say to me, 'You don't understand. You're doing a movie. I've been on my feet all day.' I'm like, 'For real? For real I don't understand?' So that's kind of odd. And the times are funny because I'm on nights and he's more organized in terms of...or last week he was getting out of the house at like 3:30 in the morning.
      [Her advice for her husband, Freddie Prinze Jr. on his sitcom Freddie (2005)] Do a sitcom. Don't do a one hour. That was actually my advice. He was going to do a one hour. I was like, 'Are you crazy? You know what people make for sitcoms and how little they work, right? You see all of our friends on sitcoms.
      You know what? I only see myself doing films that interest me and that are a little bit off the beaten path. I will go wherever that takes me. I just - - I always say it just can't be generic. I can't be the girlfriend or the wife or the - - you can't play the characters that I've been blessed to play and then do that. I can't be the girl in the film.
      I think the best piece of advice I've ever gotten is to trust myself and go for my dreams. I got that from my mom.
      Being sexy is being confident. It's important to know you don't have to have silicone breasts falling out and a thigh-high skirt. Sometimes you meet people and they think, 'Another cute little blonde actress.' That's not who I am. - on rather being known as clever than sexy.
      [on not wanting children at this point] You can't be selfish and have a child. Right now I want to live my life and have fun. I want to go sit in my Jacuzzi and drink wine all night. [December 2007]
      I had to twist his [Freddie's] arm and leg to see Moulin Rouge! (2001) Although he enjoyed it once we were there. In fact, there was a moment during the evening when I swear I thought he was going to leave me for Nicole Kidman but then, who could blame him? I'd probably leave him for Nicole if she asked. She's hot!
      It sounds clichéd, but when women turn 30 they find themselves. You become more comfortable in your own skin. Last night on Letterman I wore this skintight Herve Ledger dress. Two years ago, three years ago? I would never have worn it. - Gothman Magazine.
      [on her character Buffy Summers] For eight years I had the pleasure of portraying a character that was the very definition of a powerful woman. In my opinion, one of the greatest examples in the history of entertainment. [2007]
      As an actor, you constantly play these other characters. You're always pretending to be somebody else, but at the same time you have to keep a handle on who you are. I think that's where a lot of actresses get lost sometimes, because that's tough. I can only imagine it has to be the same as a pop star because you're not even playing a character. You're a persona.
      [After having her baby girl Charlotte] I'm not going back to work anytime soon. I'll only have my first child once and see these milestones once. I can't imagine not being there. We're (she and husband Freddie Prinze Jr.) just taking it one day at a time. I'm such a cliché right now, but she is the greatest gift that anyone has ever given me, and I will spend the rest of my life doing everything I can to do right by her. What still overwhelms me is the reality that we created this life together, and now we are responsible for her. She is here; she is ours. I'd say that makes us pretty lucky, indeed. [November 2009]
      [on the suggestion of a 'Buffy' film, 2004] 'My concern with a film is, how can we do it justice? We went out on top, and I like staying there. That doesn't mean I won't change my mind. I'm a woman. It's my prerogative to change my mind as often as I like!'
      [on working with Seth Green] 'If I had my way, I'd work with Seth on every project. I think the world of him...he's an amazingly gifted comedian and he's also a very giving comedian.'
      [on a possible Buffy reboot movie] It was a movie! It's been made. It stars Kristy Swanson, they made it! They don't need to make another one. I think it's a horrible idea to try to do a Buffy without Joss Whedon, I mean that's like honestly...to be incredibly non-eloquent, that's the dumbest idea I ever heard.
      [on the importance of reading] I love books. I'm constantly afraid we're moving into this digital era where books are going to go away, and to me books are the basis to everything in life. Reading is how we function. It's not just creative imagination and creative play, it's how we function as human beings, as human adults, and if you can instill that at a young age then that's a skill they'll have for life.
      [looking back on Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997)] I think it's gotten me to this point now where I don't have this burning desire to accomplish anything. That was so fulfilling for me in every way that everything I do now is the cherry on top. I don't feel the pressure to do this or have to do this or go here or do that because I feel like I've already won.
      [on enjoying working, but not letting it take over her life] I was 18 years old when I started "Buffy," and work was my everything. Back then, no actor had worse hours than I did. Now I don't work on weekends anymore. Everybody knows you can't sway me on that point, so nobody even tries. Plus, my perspective on work has changed: Work doesn't define who I am. I love what I do, but I don't feel a burning pressure anymore. And because I'm working for fun, I get to enjoy it. I'd watch Ringer (2011) if I wasn't on it! Of course, it's not as much fun when you know what's going to happen. It takes some of the excitement away.
      [on how having a child has changed her perspective on work] I would never fault anyone's decisions and choices, but being a parent was so important to me. I just couldn't be the parent who goes from country to country and leaves their child, or schleps their child with them.
      [on finding it difficult to understand people who view returning to TV after strictly working in film is a step down career-wise] I don't feel like I didn't succeed - The Grudge (2004) is still the second-highest female opening ever. And Ringer (2011) doesn't feel like a retrograde step, not to me. That is the weird perception, but I think it's slowly changing.
      [on whether or not she is fed up with looking back and talking about Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997)] Fed up with it? No! No, no, no! I'm so proud of it, and I actually like talking about it more now than I did then. Because I was 19, 20. Sometimes I think, to get true perspective, you have to step away, to realize the impact that something had.
      [on how Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997) affected the course of television] "Buffy" came at the right time ... Now you see these great roles on television all the time. Glenn Close in Damages (2007)? One of the greatest actresses of all time. Sally Field in Brothers & Sisters (2006)? TV is where the roles are. Without wishing to sound obnoxious, I do think it changed the course of television. It certainly changed genre television. It just came at the right time for that.
      I clip coupons all the time. Why should you pay more for something that someone else is paying less for?
      Relationships are like flowers: They need attention to grow and develop. You have to make time to be there for the other person.
      I kiss other girls, sure, but that doesn't make me a lesbian. Does it? I mean, I read ''Playgirl''.
      [on quitting Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997)] You always worry about being the show that's been on too long especially when you're a cult hit. Last year, a lot of people were ready to tear us down. So when we started to have such a strong year this year, I thought, ''This is how I want to go out on top, at our best.'' I was 18 when I started the show; I'm 26. I'm married. I never see my husband. This has been the longest span of my life in one place. There've been times where that's been difficult, you want to pick up and go, try other things, live in different places. It feels right, and you have to listen to that. The show, as we know it, is over. I love this job, I love the fans. I love telling the stories we tell. This isn't about leaving for a career in movies, or in theater, it's more of a personal decision. I need a rest. Teachers get sabbaticals. Actors don't.
      [on 'The Crazy Ones'] James Wolk is a star. Like I said to Robin, 'Its great that you're Robin Williams and you're great and you're funny, but Jimmy Wolk is stealing this entire show from you. Like, watch out
      [on being called Buffy] Back then, if you'd called me Buffy I would probably have been really annoyed. Now, of course, I get it and I'm appreciative of it. But that's something that comes with maturity, which most people don't have when they're 24 years old.
      I've definitely smoked cigarettes, and I've partied plenty. I just got it out of my system early. I was lucky enough to have had my experiences when I was younger - and out of the public eye. When I was younger, I was very careful not to... I just didn't want to be seen with a drink in my hand. People looked up to Buffy, and she was a character that girls respected.
      [on motherhood] For me, having a child was that cliched, life-altering experience where everything took on a different meaning. Things that had once been priorities had no meaning to me anymore, and things that I'd never thought about suddenly became things that were on my mind. If I'd known how happy having a child would make me, I probably would have had one a long time ago.

Sarah Michelle (Gellar) Prinze[2] (born April 14, 1977) is an American actress and producer. In 1983, she made her acting debut in the made-for-TV movie An Invasion of Privacy and went on to appear in Spenser: For Hire and Crossbow. Gellar had her first lead part in 1992's mini-series Swans Crossing and originated the role of Kendall Hart on the ABC daytime soap opera All My Children, winning the 1995 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series.
Gellar came to prominence in the late 1990s, landing roles in 1997's horror films I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scream 2. She portrayed Buffy Summers on the WB/UPN TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003), for which she won six Teen Choice Awards, the Saturn Award for Best Genre TV Actress and received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress – Television Series Drama. She also gained recognition for her performances as Kathryn Merteuil in Cruel Intentions (1999) and Daphne Blake in Scooby-Doo (2002).
After Buffy ended, Gellar starred in the films Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004), The Grudge (2004), and The Grudge 2 (2006). She had the starring role in the television drama series Ringer, from 2011 to 2012. Gellar starred in the CBS television sitcom The Crazy Ones alongside Robin Williams from 2013 until it was cancelled on May 2014.[3]
Sarah Michelle Gellar was born on April 14, 1977 in New York City. She is the only child of garment worker Arthur Gellar and nursery school teacher Rosellen Greenfield.[4] Both of her parents were Jewish, though Gellar's family had a Christmas tree during her childhood holidays.[5][6]
In 1984, when she was seven, her parents divorced and she was raised by her mother on the city's Upper East Side. She was a student at Birch Wathen Lenox School and graduated from Fiorello LaGuardia High School of the Performing Arts in 1995.[7]
In an early 2000s interview, talking about not having a father figure in her early life, she remarked: "I might have been an immaculate conception. You never know. My father, you can just say, is not in the picture. I'm not being deliberately evasive about him, it's just that there's so little to say. He is not a person who exists in my life. Just because you donate sperm does not make you a father. I don't have a father. I would never give him the credit to acknowledge him as my father".[8]

At four, she was spotted by an agent in a restaurant in Uptown Manhattan. Two weeks later, she auditioned for a part in An Invasion of Privacy, a television film starring Valerie Harper, Carol Kane and Jeff Daniels. At the audition, Gellar read both her own lines and those of Harper, impressing the directors enough to cast her in the role. She subsequently appeared in a controversial television commercial for Burger King, in which her character criticized McDonald's and claimed to eat only at Burger King. This led to a lawsuit by McDonald's which banned her from eating at McDonald's for life (Per TMZ). As a child, Gellar modeled for magazines.[9]
Gellar appeared in TV series such as Spenser: For Hire and Crossbow, and had minor roles in the films Funny Farm (1988) and High Stakes (1989). She appeared in the young-teen girl talk show Girl Talk. In 1991, she appeared as a young Jacqueline Bouvier in the TV movie A Woman Named Jackie. Gellar's first major acting work came in 1992, when she starred in the serial Swans Crossing and was subsequently cast in the soap opera All My Children, playing Kendall Hart, the long-lost daughter of character Erica Kane (Susan Lucci). In 1995, at the age of eighteen, she won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series for the role.[10] Gellar left All My Children in 1995.[citation needed]
Gellar landed the lead in the 1997 TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, playing a teenager burdened with the responsibility of fighting a number of mystical foes, mostly vampires. She was screen tested eleven times (originally auditioning for the role of Cordelia Chase). The show was well received by critics and audiences. It had seven seasons and 144 episodes. Gellar sang during the Buffy the Vampire Slayer musical episode "Once More, with Feeling", which spawned an original cast album.[citation needed]
She first had her major film role in the popular slasher film I Know What You Did Last Summer. She was cast as Helen Shiver, an aspiring beauty actress.[11] Washington Post found her "likable".[12] The film was successful at the box office, grossing $125,586,134 around the globe[13] and earned Gellar a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Supporting Actress – Horror and a MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Breakthrough Performance.[14][15] As a result the film has been parodied and referenced in popular culture.[16] Gellar got a role in the teen horror Scream 2, in which she portrayed Cici Cooper,[17] a Sorority sister and film fan. She signed on to Scream 2 without having read the script, on the basis of the success of the first film.[18] The film gained acclaim and earned an impressive $172,363,301.[19] With her recent work at the time, she cemented her It girl status with her first appearance on the 'Most Beautiful' list by People magazine.[20] In 1998, she appeared in one episode of Saturday Night Live and went on to host the show two more times until 2002. She also provided the voice of the Gwendy Doll in Small Soldiers (1998), a commercial success[21] with mixed feedback.[22]
After making a cameo appearance in the romantic comedy She's All That, Gellar had the starring role in Simply Irresistible, film that premiered in early 1999. The film opened to negative reviews[23] and did not do well at the box office.[24] She admitted in an interview having regrets for her choice to work in the film: "Simply Irresistible was just a bad choice – and for that, it was a great learning experience. I wasn't ready to make that movie. I was too young. The script was not ready. I knew in my heart before I left to make it that I should back out."[25]
Cruel Intentions (1999), a modern-day retelling of Les Liaisons dangereuses featured a kiss between Gellar and co-star Selma Blair that won the two the "Best Kiss" award at the 2000 MTV Movie Awards. This film was a modest hit at the box office, grossing over $38 million in the United States and over $75 million worldwide,[26] and earned several awards and nominations. Critic Roger Ebert stated that Gellar and co-star Ryan Phillippe "develop a convincing emotional charge" and that Gellar is "effective as a bright girl who knows exactly how to use her act as a tramp".[27] Gellar's role showed her versatility as an actress, and many were surprised to see her playing a brunette cocaine addict with an appetite for manipulating and using people. Her performance was praised by a number of critics, including Rob Blackwelder for SPLICEDwire, who wrote about the "dazzling performance by Sarah Michelle Gellar who plunges headlong into the lascivious malevolence that makes Kathryn so delightfully wicked. (Plus she looks great in a corset.)".[28] Around that time, she guest-starred in three episodes of Angel and appeared as Debbie in the HBO series Sex and the City episode "Escape from New York".[citation needed]
Gellar subsequently was casted a lead role in James Toback's independent Harvard Man (2001), as a mobster's daughter, to mixed reviews at its premiere.[29] Filmcitic.com found Gellar's performance "memorable" along with cast's.[30] Two sex scenes with Gellar helped her shed her good girl image along with 1999's Cruel Intentions.[31] In 2002, Gellar portrayed Daphne Blake in Scooby-Doo, which received negative reviews[32] but grossed $275,650,703 worldwide,[33] making it the 15th most successful film worldwide of 2002.[34] Gellar won the Teen Choice Award in the category of Choice Movie Actress: Comedy.[35]
During her growing film career Gellar continued work on the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer; however, she decided to leave the show after the seventh season. When asked why, she explained, "This isn't about leaving for a career in movies, or in theater – it's more of a personal decision. I need a rest."[25] Shortly after the show's end, Gellar stated that she had no interest in appearing in a Buffy feature film, but that she will consider it if the script is good enough.[36] She did not appear in the final season of Angel, causing the intended episode ("You're Welcome") to be rewritten for the character of Cordelia Chase.[37] Gellar has said that she was willing to appear in the episode, but scheduling conflicts and family problems prevented it.[38] Another actress, Giselle Loren, voiced Buffy for an animated series based on the show, which never aired, and the various Buffy video games. In her feature in Esquire magazine Gellar expressed her pride for her work on Buffy, "I truly believe that it is one of the greatest shows of all time and it will go down in history as that. And I don't feel that that is a cocky statement. We changed the way that people looked at television."[39] Gellar's likeness is used in the comic continuation of the series.[citation needed]
After the end of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gellar provided her voice for the character Gina Vendetti in The Simpson episode "The Wandering Juvie" that aired in March 2004. Her next film was Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed. The movie received negative reviews[40] but was a commercial success, grossing $181,466,833 around the globe.[41] In that year, she appeared in the horror film The Grudge, which was also a hit with a $187,281,115 worldwide gross.[42] Gellar received praise for her role of Karen Davis,[43] and many critics referenced her performance as the reason for the film's success.[44] She then received a MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Frightened Performance as well as a nomination for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress: Thriller for the part of Karen.[45][46] In 2005, she had a voice-over role in an episode of the animated television series Robot Chicken. Since then, Gellar has voiced several other characters, in a total of 12 episodes of the show, as of 2013.[citation needed]
Gellar appeared in the sequel The Grudge 2, which opened in October 2006; in the film, she had a supporting role reprising her character from the first film. Upon her appearance, she received mixed reviews due to the character's surprise death upsetting many fans.[47] Although not being as successful as the first installment, the movie was a modest commercial hit that premiered at number one at the box office, garnering $22 million in its opening weekend.[48] Gellar next appeared in the thriller The Return, which was released the following month and in which she played a businesswoman haunted by memories of her childhood and the mysterious death of a young woman. The movie was marketed as a horror movie and many including critics were surprised to find The Return was, as Rafe Telsch said, "just a murder mystery with a few supernatural elements". The movie pulled in a disappointing $4,800,000 weekend gross with little promotion.[49]
Gellar then lent her voice to the animated film Happily N'Ever After, which was universally panned by critics[50] and unsuccessful at the box office.[51] However, her next animated movie, TMNT (in which she played April O'Neil), was a commercial success, grossing over $95 million[52] while it received a mixed reception.[53] Her project, Richard Kelly's thriller Southland Tales opened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2006 and came out in a limited release in the U.S. on November 9, 2007,[54] garnering divided reviews.[55] Gellar had met with Kelly and was drawn to the original ideas in his script for the movie.[56]
Suburban Girl and The Air I Breathe – in which Gellar starred – were screened at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival. Suburban Girl was released direct-to-DVD in January 2008. It was described as "a blend of Sex and the City and The Devil Wears Prada" and a "pseudo-sophisticated romantic comedy" according to Variety.com.[57] Her on screen chemistry with Alec Baldwin was either criticized or praised, with Eye For Film commenting, "The film works best when Baldwin and Gellar are together – aside from the fact that Gellar seriously needs to eat a bun or two".[58] Film website Moviepicturefilm.com stated "Gellar and Baldwin both give wonderful performances and make their chemistry incredibly real and ultimately, quite heartbreaking. Containing a ton of laughs and killer fashion that could give "The Devil Wears Prada" a run for its money, this movie has something uncommon in most romantic comedies, tons of style and a huge heart."[59] The Air I Breathe premiered theatrically the same month in a limited release (making more than 2 million at the worldwide box office)[60] to generally poor reviews.[61] The New York Times called it a "gangster movie with delusions of grandeur."[62] However, Gellar's performance was praised by a number of critics, DVD Talk Review noted that "her character here has the deepest emotional arc, and she hits all the right notes."[63]
Gellar had the starring role in the psychological thriller Possession. Due to financial problems at YARI Film Group, the movie had a range of release dates in the U.S. between 2008 and 2009,[64][65][66] and it was ultimately released straight-to-video in March 2010.[67] However, Possession had theatrical openings in various countries such as Argentina, Ecuador and Mexico,[68] gaining $682,173.[69] Gellar also starred in Veronika Decides to Die (2009).[70] The film tells the story of a young woman suffering from severe depression who rediscovers the joy in life when she finds out that she only has days to live following a suicide attempt. Filming of the movie began on May 12, 2008, in New York City[71] and finished in late June.[72] It was reported that Kate Bosworth was previously attached to the project.[73] The movie and Gellar herself received acclaim[74][75][76] and Veronika was theatrically opened in limited release in several countries throughout 2009 and grossed over $1.3 million worldwide.[77] At that time, her daughter Charlotte Grace Prinze was born and Gellar took a rest from film roles in order to spend time with her child.[citation needed]
In 2011, Gellar signed on to star and work as executive producer for a new drama titled Ringer, in which she plays a woman on the run who manages to hide by living the life of her wealthy twin sister. The show was originally made for CBS but was picked up by its sister channel The CW in May 2011.[78][79] Gellar has stated that part of her decision to return to a television series was because it allows her to both work and raise her daughter.[80] The series premiered with mixed-positive reviews; E! Online wrote that Gellar was "awesome" and "fantastic",[81] TV Line remarked she "does a fine job" as both characters[82] and USA Today found her performance "well-defined".[83] The first episode brought high rating for the network (with 2.84 million viewers), however after a decline in ratings and viewership from the three month hiatus over the holiday break, The CW announced the cancellation of Ringer.[84]
On August 4, 2011, Gellar confirmed she would be returning as a guest star on the ABC soap opera All My Children before the show's ending in September but not as Kendall Hart.[85] Her airdate was September 21, 2011.[86] She portrayed a patient at Pine Valley Hospital. She tells Maria Santos that Pine Valley is familiar to her, and, that she is "Erica Kane's daughter". She also states that she saw vampires before they became trendy—a reference to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Gellar then guest-starred in the American Dad episode "Virtual In-Stanity" (aired on November 20, 2011), which brought 4.82 million viewers.[87] Her former Buffy co-star Alyson Hannigan also made a voice-over role in the episode, receiving positive reviews.[88] The AV Club called Gellar and Hannigan "effective guest stars" and that "both have voices with enough personality to fit their characters".[88] Gellar provided her voice again for the December 6, 2012 episode of the show ("Adventures in Hayleysitting").[89]
On February 15, 2013, it was reported that Gellar would return to television with a pilot for CBS entitled The Crazy Ones opposite Robin Williams.[90] The show is a single-camera comedy, about an advertising agency run by a father (Williams) and his daughter (Gellar).[91] The series aired at 9/8c on Thursday nights, beginning September 26, 2013 until April 17, 2014,[92] for which she won a People's Choice Award for Favourite Actress in a New TV Series.[93]
Gellar has appeared on the covers of Cosmopolitan, Glamour, FHM, Rolling Stone, and other magazines. She was featured in the annual Maxim "Hot 100" list in 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2008 and in FHM's "100 Sexiest Women" of 2005. She was voted number 1 in the magazine's 1999 edition. Gellar has appeared in "Got Milk?" ads as well as in the Stone Temple Pilots music video "Sour Girl" and Marcy Playground music video "Comin' Up From Behind". In 2007, she was ranked No.54 on FHM Hot 100 List and was a celebrity spokesperson for Maybelline. Wearing a black lace brassiere, she was on the cover of the December 2007 issue of Maxim magazine and was named Maxim magazine's 2009 Woman of the Year. In 2009 she ranked in the top 5 of the Maxim "Hot 100" list.[94]
She was also featured in Google's Top 10 Women Searches of 2002 and 2003, coming in at #8, and featured in UK Channel 4's 100 Greatest Sex Symbols in 2007, ranked at #16. Roles like Buffy and Cruel Intentions made her a sex symbol across the globe. Gellar featured in FHM's German, Dutch, South African, Danish and Romanian editions 100 Sexiest Women lists every year from 1998 onwards.[95] Topsocialite.com listed her as the 8th Sexiest woman of the 90s along with Alicia Silverstone, Gillian Anderson, and Shannen Doherty.[96] Other appearances and listings include: Entertainment Weekly ranked her in its Top 100 TV Icons in 2007, Entertainment Weekly ranked her #3 in its Top 12 Entertainers of the Year in 1998 and Glamour ranked her in its 50 Best Dressed Women in the World 2004 and 2005 at No.17 and #24.[95] BuddyTV ranked her #27 on TV's 100 Sexiest Women of 2011 list.[97]
In 2007, Gellar was featured in Vaseline's "Skin Is Amazing" campaign, with other actors such as Hilary Duff, Amanda Bynes, and John Leguizamo. Gellar graced the cover of Gotham and featured as their main story in the March 2008 issue, in which she spoke about how passing 30 has evolved her style. Gellar said: "It sounds clichéd, but when women turn 30, they find themselves. You become more comfortable in your own skin. Last night on Letterman, I wore this skintight Herve Leger dress. Two years ago, three years ago? I would never have worn it."[citation needed]
Gellar met her future husband Freddie Prinze, Jr. during filming of the 1997 teen horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer,[98] but the two did not begin dating until 2000. They were engaged in April 2001 and married in Mexico on September 1, 2002 in a ceremony officiated by Adam Shankman, a film director and choreographer with whom Gellar had worked on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Gellar's bridesmaid was her closest friend of many years, Lindsay Sloane. Prinze and Gellar also played each other's respective love interests as Fred and Daphne in the 2002 film Scooby-Doo and its sequel, Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed.[citation needed]
In 2004, while filming The Grudge in Japan, Gellar visited the Japanese swordsmith Shoji Yoshihara (Kuniie III) and bought a katana from him as a birthday present for her husband.[99] Gellar learned that she needed clearance from the Japanese government to remove the sword from the country and, after eventually succeeding, stated that it was "incredibly difficult" to do.[100]
Gellar and Prinze have two children together: daughter Charlotte Grace Prinze (born in September 2009),[101] and son Rocky James Prinze (born in September 2012).[102] The family lives in Los Angeles, California.[103]
Gellar is an active advocate for various charities, including breast cancer research, Project Angel Food, Habitat for Humanity, and CARE. Of her charitable pursuits, she says, "I started because my mother taught me a long time ago that even when you have nothing, there's ways to give back. And what you get in return for that is tenfold. But it was always hard because I couldn't do a lot. I couldn't do much more than just donate money when I was on the show because there wasn't time. And now that I have the time, it's amazing."[citation needed]
In May 2011, Gellar joined "The Nestlé Share the Joy of Reading Program" which aims to promote the importance of reading to the development of young children and to encourage them to continue reading over the summer break.[104][105]

The 5' 3," sandy blonde-haired Gen-Y icon Sarah Michelle Gellar's life story reads like a preteen wish fulfillment fantasy. Born in Manhattan in 1977 and discovered by an agent in a Manhattan restaurant at the age of four, Gellar signed for her first role (in the 1983 telemovie An Invasion of Privacy) not one week later. A plethora of bit parts in television series (Spenser: For Hire) and theatrical films (Over the Brooklyn Bridge, 1984; Funny Farm, 1988; High Stakes, 1989) followed, before Gellar landed a recurring role, in the early '90s, on the decades-long daytime soap opera All My Children. Throughout the early years of her career, Gellar was managed and supervised by her mother, a former nursery school teacher who insisted on straight A's as a prerequisite of an acting career. Sarah Michelle delivered, time and again. Despite the apparent fairy tale-like quality of her rise, Gellar reportedly battled several decidedly unhappy experiences as a child, including a parental divorce, decades of estrangement from her father, and social struggles in a New York City high school, experiences parlayed into her first (and most infamous) lead: that of Buffy, a California valley girl high school student-turned-"exterminator of the undead" in the early-'90s syndicated cult fantasy series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Gellar inherited the role from Kristy Swanson, who fleshed it out in the (decidedly more comic) 1992 theatrical release of the same name. Under Gellar's aegis, the show lasted seven years, from 1996 through 2003, and it became a massive international hit, garnering legions of fans. The subject matter of the series required the young actress to engage in rigorous exercise and physical training off-camera throughout Buffy's run. Gellar (a compulsive shopper and brand aficionado off-camera) then signed as a Maybelline spokeswoman and prepared to move into the third phase of her acting career. As Buffy wrapped, it coincided with the resurgence of American teen horror films led by Wes Craven's Scream series, and although Gellar did not join the cast of the first installment, her popularity on Buffy the Vampire Slayer thematically paved the way for involvement in one Scream sequel and one emulator: Scream 2 and I Know What You Did Last Summer (both 1997). In 1999, Gellar teamed up with two other notables of the same generation, Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe, for the Dangerous Liaisons teen update Cruel Intentions. As Kathryn Merteuil -- the depraved schemer who coaxes her stepbrother (Phillippe) into deflowering the school headmaster's daughter (Witherspoon), and thus inadvertently sets in motion a chain of disasters that will destroy them all -- Gellar played off of her wholesome, "all-American girl" image and helped turn the picture into a minor hit.  Meanwhile, Gellar met and fell in love with Hollywood heartthrob Freddie Prinze Jr. (the son of the ill-fated, late-'70s Hispanic comedian Freddie Prinze), and the two married in Mexico in 2002, the same year they co-starred as Fred and Daphne for director Raja Gosnell in the live-action summer blockbuster Scooby-Doo. Two years later, Gellar and Prinze took the wheel of the Mystery Machine to fight a mischievous specter in 2004's Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed. Gellar (long a student and admirer of Japanese culture) then traveled to Japan to do battle with some truly frightening entities in the 2004 J-horror remake The Grudge. In that effort, she plays an American student employed at a Japanese health center who uncovers a centuries-old curse that feeds off of anger and guides one victim after another into an unquenchable, violent rage.Subsequent vocal work on the animated cult hit Robot Chicken found the former vampire slayer having a bit of behind-the-scenes fun without the stress of appearing before the camera, and a role as an ambitious porn star teetering on the edge of the apocalypse in director Richard Kelly's eagerly anticipated Donnie Darko follow-up, Southland Tales, preceded a trip back into terror as a successful business woman haunted by a decades-old murder in the 2006 supernatural thriller The Return. In that picture, Gellar plays Joanna Mills, a thick-skinned, courageous Midwestern girl plagued by haunting supernatural visions, who attempts to uncover the origin of these specters. Unfortunately, that film opened to horrendous critical reviews and lackluster box office numbers in November 2006, appearing and disappearing quickly. Gellar would do plenty of voice acting in movies like the family-friendly CG-animated fairy tale Happily N'Ever After and the Weinstein-produced, CG-animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Gellar would ultimately find continued success in TV, however, lending her voice to the animated sketch comedy series Robot Chicken, and her role on the series Ringer. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi
