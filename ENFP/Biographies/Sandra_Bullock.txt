 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Sandra Bullock was born in a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C., to Helga (Meyer), a German opera singer, and John W. Bullock, a U.S. voice teacher from Alabama. She grew up on the road with her parents and younger sister. She often performed in the children's chorus of whatever production her mother was in. That singing talent later came in handy for her role as an aspiring country singer in The Thing Called Love (1993). Her family moved back to the Washington area when she was adolescent. She later enrolled in East Carolina University in North Carolina, where she studied acting. Shortly afterward she moved to New York to pursue a career on the stage. This led to acting in television programs and then feature films. She gave memorable performances in Demolition Man (1993) and Wrestling Ernest Hemingway (1993), but did not achieve the stardom that seemed inevitable for her until her work in the smash hit Speed (1994). She now ranks as one of the most popular actresses in Hollywood. For her role in The Blind Side (2009) she won the Oscar, and her blockbusters The Proposal (2009), The Heat (2013) and Gravity (2013) made her a bankable star. With $56,000,000, she was listed in the Guinness Book Of World Records as the highest-paid actress in the world.

      I've learned that success comes in a very prickly package. Whether you choose to accept it or not is up to you. It's what you choose to do with it, the people you choose to surround yourself with. Always choose people that are better than you. Always choose people that challenge you and are smarter than you. Always be the student. Once you find yourself to be the teacher, you've lost it.

      The first Miss Congeniality (2000) gave me the chance to do broad comedy that had nothing to do with being the romantic interest. The girl-next-door thing went away with that film and I tend to do characters that I want to be more like. In the beginning, though, I was sort of the 'action girl'. And then with While You Were Sleeping (1995), I was the romantic-comedy girl. But when I took time off, I thought, 'There's something I'm missing here.' I literally had to start from scratch.
      I don't like to talk about personal things. ... And by keeping it private, you have a better shot at a healthy relationship. I learned at a young age that there are certain things you just don't talk about.

I'm going, One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three and break. It's like choreography. Sometimes you have actors who feel it's their job to get as far down into your throat as possible. You're like, Excuse me, I like you, but not that much.
      Why do you need one? I don't understand why there needs to be a love interest to make women go see a film. I think society sort of makes us feel that way - that if you don't have a guy, you're worthless.

Sandra Annette Bullock (/ˈbʊlək/; born July 26, 1964)[1] is an American actress and producer. She rose to fame in the 1990s with roles in films such as Demolition Man (1993), Speed (1994), The Net (1995), While You Were Sleeping (1995), A Time to Kill (1996), and Hope Floats (1998). In the new millennium, Bullock starred in Miss Congeniality (2000), Two Weeks Notice (2002), The Lake House (2006), and the critically acclaimed Crash (2004) and Gravity (2013). In 2007, she was ranked as the 14th richest woman in the entertainment industry with an estimated fortune of $85 million.[2] In 2009, Bullock starred in two of the more financially successful films of her career, The Proposal[3] and The Blind Side.[4] Bullock was awarded the BFCA Award, SAG Award, Golden Globe Award, and the Academy Award for her leading role as Leigh Anne Tuohy in The Blind Side.
She is listed in the 2012 edition of Guinness World Records as the highest-paid actress, with $56 million.[5] In 2013, she starred in The Heat, financially the most successful comedy of the year at the domestic box office, and Gravity, which was released on October 4, 2013 to coincide with the beginning of World Space Week. As one of the highest grossing films of the year, Gravity is Bullock's most successful film critically and commercially.[6][7][8] For her role as Dr. Ryan Stone in Gravity, Bullock was nominated a second time for the Academy Award for Best Actress, along with the BFCA, Golden Globe and SAG awards and also received her first BAFTA nomination.
Bullock was born in Arlington, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. Her father, John W. Bullock (born 1925), was a United States Army employee and part-time voice coach; her mother, Helga Mathilde Meyer (1942–2000), was an opera singer and voice teacher.[9][10] Bullock's father was from Birmingham, Alabama, and had English, Irish, German, and French ancestry, while Bullock's mother was German.[11][12][13] Bullock's maternal grandfather was a rocket scientist from Nuremberg, Germany. Bullock's father, then in charge of the Army's Military Postal Service in Europe, was stationed in Nuremberg when he met his wife. They married in Germany and moved to Arlington, where John worked with the Army Materiel Command, before becoming a contractor for The Pentagon.[14][15] She has a younger sister, Gesine Bullock-Prado, who was formerly the vice-president of Bullock's production company Fortis Films.[1]
Bullock was raised in Nuremberg, Germany for twelve years and grew up speaking German.[16][17] She attended the humanistic Waldorf School.[18] As a child, Bullock frequently accompanied her mother on European opera tours. Bullock studied ballet and vocal arts as a child, taking small parts in her mother's opera productions. She sang in the opera's children's choir at the Staatstheater Nürnberg.[19] The scar above her left eye was caused when she fell into a creek as a child.[20][21] Bullock attended Washington-Lee High School, where she was a cheerleader and performed in high school theater productions. After graduating in 1982, she attended East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina, where she received a degree in drama in 1986.[22] She then moved to Manhattan and supported herself as a bartender, cocktail waitress, and coat checker while auditioning for roles.[23]
Until the age of eighteen, Bullock held an American/German dual citizenship.[24] In 2009, she reapplied for German citizenship.[25]
While in New York, Bullock took acting classes with Sanford Meisner.[1] She appeared in several student films, and later landed a role in an Off-Broadway play No Time Flat. Director Alan J. Levi was impressed by Bullock's performance and offered her a part in the TV movie Bionic Showdown: The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman (1989). This led to her being cast in a series of small roles in several independent films as well as in the lead role of the short-lived NBC television version of the film Working Girl (1990). She went on to appear in several films, such as Love Potion No. 9 (1992), The Thing Called Love (1993) and Fire on the Amazon (1993). A prominent supporting role in the science-fiction/action film Demolition Man (1993) was followed by her breakthrough performance in Speed the following year. Speed was a huge hit that took in $350 million at the box office worldwide, making it her second most successful picture to date.[26]
A string of successes during the mid-1990s included While You Were Sleeping (1995), for which she received her first Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, The Net (1995) and A Time to Kill (1996). Bullock received $11 million for Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997), which she agreed to star in for financial backing for her own project, Hope Floats (1998),[27] and has revealed she regrets making the sequel.[28] She was selected as one of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People in the World in 1996 and 1999, and was also ranked #58 in Empire magazine's Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time list.
In 2000, Bullock starred in Miss Congeniality, a financial success that took in $212 million at the box office worldwide,[29] and received another Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. She was presented with the 2002 Raúl Juliá Award for Excellence[30] for her efforts, as the executive producer of the sitcom George Lopez, in helping expand career openings for Hispanic talent in the media and entertainment industry. She also made several appearances on the show as Accident Amy, an accident-prone employee at the factory Lopez's character manages. The same year, she starred opposite Hugh Grant in Two Weeks Notice (2002).[31]
In 2004, Bullock had a supporting role in the film Crash, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. She received positive reviews for her performance, with some critics suggesting that it was the best performance of her career.[32] She later received a $17.5-million-salary for Miss Congeniality 2: Armed & Fabulous (2005).[33] The same year, she was a co-recipient of the Women in Film Crystal Award.[34]
Although Bullock was reunited with her Speed co-star Keanu Reeves in the romantic drama The Lake House, their film characters are separated throughout the film, so Bullock and Reeves were only on set together for two weeks during filming.[35] The same year, Bullock appeared in Infamous, playing author Harper Lee. Bullock also starred in Premonition with Julian McMahon, which was released in March 2007.[36] In 2008, Bullock was announced as "the face" of prestigious cosmetic brand Artistry.[37]

The year 2009 proved to be especially good for Bullock, giving the actress two record highs in her career, as earlier in the year she released The Proposal, with co-star Ryan Reynolds, a huge hit that took in $317 million at the box office worldwide, making it her third most successful picture to date.[38] She received her third Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for that role.
In November 2009, Bullock starred in The Blind Side, which opened at #2 behind New Moon with $34.2 million, making it her second highest opening weekend ever. The Blind Side is unique in that it had a 17.6% increase at the box office its second weekend, and it took the top spot of the box office in its third weekend. The film cost $29 million to make according to the Box Office Mojo. It grossed over $309 million, making it her domestic highest grossing film, her fourth highest grossing film worldwide, and the first one in history to pass the $200 million mark with only one top-billed female star.[39][40] Bullock had initially turned down the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy three times due to a discomfort with portraying a devout Christian.[41] She was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actress, Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role and Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress.[42] The Blind Side also received an Academy Award for Best Picture nomination.
Winning the Oscar also gave Bullock another unique distinction — since she won two "Razzies" the day before, for her performance in All About Steve (2009), she is the only performer ever to have been named both "Best" and "Worst" for the same year.[43] Sandra was asked to return her 2009 "Worst Actress of the Year" Razzie award; however, this wasn't because of a change of heart for Bullock's performance but because Bullock personally accepted her Razzie and accidentally took the original one-of-a-kind prototype Razzie, as opposed to the cheap trinket normally handed out to celebrities.[44]
In 2011, Bullock starred in the drama Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close alongside Tom Hanks, a film adaptation based on the novel of the same name.[45] Despite mixed reviews,[46] the film was nominated for numerous awards, including an Academy Award for Best Picture nomination. Bullock was nominated for Best Supporting Actress by Georgia Film Critics Association and Best Actress Drama by Teen Choice Awards.
She starred in the 2013 comedy film The Heat, alongside Melissa McCarthy.[47] It received positive reviews from critics,[48][49] and took in $230 million at the box office worldwide.[50] Bullock also starred in the science fiction film Gravity, opposite George Clooney.[51] The premiere was in August, at the 70th Venice Film Festival, and the film was released on October 4, 2013 to coincide with the beginning of World Space Week. The film was originally scheduled to be released on November 21, 2012, before being re-scheduled for a 2013 release in order to complete extensive post-production effects work.[52][53] Gravity received universal acclaim among critics and a standing ovation in Venice.[54][55][56][57] The movie was called "marvelous, the most realistic and the most beautifully choreographed movie ever set in space".[56][58] Bullock's performance was praised,[56][57][58] with some of the critics saying that Gravity is the best work of her career, and many calling her out as a major frontrunner for the Academy Award for Best Actress.[59][60][61] Variety wrote that "Bullock inhabits the role with grave dignity and hints at Stone's past scars with sensitivity and tact, and she holds the screen effortlessly once Gravity becomes a veritable one-woman show... the actress remains fully present emotionally, projecting a very appealing combo of vulnerability, intelligence and determination that not only wins us over immediately, but sustains attention all the way through the cathartic closing reels."[62] As of February 25, 2014, Gravity, took in $715 million at the box office worldwide, making it Bullock's most successful picture to date.[8] For her role as Dr. Ryan Stone, Bullock was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama, BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role and Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress.
By 2009, Bullock's films had grossed over $3.1 billion worldwide.[63] According to The Numbers, her total domestic gross stands at $1.7 billion, placing her among the Top 100 Stars at the Box Office.[64]
Whereas critics praised her screen persona,[65] some have been less receptive towards her films. At the 2009 release of The Proposal, Mark Kermode said she has made only three "good" films in her career—Speed, While You Were Sleeping, and Crash, and says "she's funny, she's gorgeous, it's impossible not to love her and yet she makes rotten film after rotten film after rotten film."[66] As of December 2009, Bullock has appeared on three Entertainment Weekly covers. She was selected by People magazine as its "Woman of the Year" for 2010.[67] She was ranked #12 on People's Most Beautiful 2011 list.[68]
In November 2013 it was announced that Bullock won Entertainment Weekly's "Entertainer of the Year," mostly due to the success of her roles in The Heat and Gravity, which Entertainment Weekly believed would earn her an Oscar nomination. Bullock is on the cover of Entertainment Weekly for the December 6 issue of the American entertainment and pop culture magazine. Bullock shares the Entertainment Weekly "Entertainer of the Year" title with other distinguished people in the industry such as the 'masterminds' behind the television show Breaking Bad, Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Lawrence, "Grumpy Cat," among several others.[69]
Bullock runs her own production company, Fortis Films. Bullock was an executive producer of the George Lopez sitcom, which garnered a lucrative syndication deal that banked her some $10 million (co-produced with Robert Borden).[70] Bullock tried to produce a film based on F.X. Toole's short story, Million-Dollar Baby, but could not interest the studios in a female boxing drama. The story was eventually adapted and directed by Clint Eastwood as the Oscar-winning film, Million Dollar Baby (2004).[71] Fortis Films also produced All About Steve which was released in September 2009. Her father, John Bullock, is the company's CEO,[72] and her sister, Gesine Bullock-Prado, is the former president.
In November 2006 Bullock founded an Austin, Texas restaurant, Bess Bistro, located on West 6th Street.[73] She later opened another business, Walton's Fancy and Staple, across the street in a building she extensively renovated. Walton's is a bakery, upscale restaurant and floral shop that also offers services including event planning.[74]
Bullock was once engaged to actor Tate Donovan, whom she met while filming Love Potion No. 9; their relationship lasted three years.[75] She previously dated football player Troy Aikman, and actors Matthew McConaughey and Ryan Gosling.[76][77]
Bullock married motorcycle builder and Monster Garage host Jesse James on July 16, 2005. They first met when Bullock arranged for her ten-year-old godson to meet James as a Christmas present. In November 2009, Bullock and James entered into a custody battle with James' second ex-wife, former pornographic actress Janine Lindemulder, with whom James had a child. Bullock and James subsequently won full legal custody of James' five-year-old daughter.[78]
In March 2010, a scandal arose when several women claimed to have had affairs with James during his marriage to Bullock.[79][80][81] Bullock cancelled European promotional appearances for The Blind Side citing "unforeseen personal reasons."[82][83] On March 18, 2010, James responded to the rumors of infidelity by issuing a public apology to Bullock. He stated, "The vast majority of the allegations reported are untrue and unfounded" and "Beyond that, I will not dignify these private matters with any further public comment."[84] James declared that "There is only one person to blame for this whole situation, and that is me", and asked that his wife and children one day "find it in their hearts to forgive me" for their current "pain and embarrassment."[84] James' publicist subsequently announced on March 30, 2010, that James had checked into a rehab facility "to deal with personal issues" and "save his marriage" to Bullock.[85] However on April 28, 2010, it was reported that Bullock had filed for divorce[86] on April 23 in Austin.[87] Their divorce was finalized on June 28, 2010, with "conflict of personalities" cited as the reason.[88]
Bullock announced on April 28, 2010, that she had proceeded with plans to adopt a son born in January 2010 in New Orleans.[89] Bullock and James had begun an initial adoption process four months earlier. Bullock's son began living with them in January 2010, but they chose to keep the news private until after the Oscars in March 2010. However, given the couple's separation and then divorce, Bullock continued the adoption of her son Louis Bardo Bullock, as a single parent.[89]
On December 20, 2000, Bullock, another passenger, and the two crew survived the crash of a chartered business jet during an attempted night landing at Jackson Hole Airport. The pilots were unable to activate the runway lights due to having out-of-date approach plates, but continued the landing. The aircraft landed in the airport's graded safety area between the runway and parallel taxiway and hit a snowbank. The accident caused a separation of the nose cone and landing gear, partial separation of the right wing, and a bend in the left wing.[90]
On April 18, 2008, while Bullock was in Massachusetts shooting the film The Proposal, she and her husband were in an SUV that was hit head-on (driver's side offset) at moderate speed by a drunken driver. Vehicle damage was not major and there were no injuries.[91]
In October 2004, Bullock won a multimillion-dollar judgment against Benny Daneshjou, the builder of her Lake Austin, Texas home; the jury ruled the house was uninhabitable. It has since been torn down and rebuilt.[92]
On April 22, 2007, Marcia Diana Valentine was found lying outside James and Bullock's Southern California home in Orange County. When James confronted the woman, she ran to her car, got behind the wheel, and tried to run over James. The woman is said to be an obsessed fan of Sandra Bullock.[93] The woman was charged with one felony count each of aggravated assault and stalking. Bullock[94] obtained a restraining order to bar Valentine from "contacting or coming near her home, family or work for three years."[95] Valentine pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated assault and stalking.[96] Valentine was subsequently convicted of stalking and was sentenced to three years of probation.[97]
Bullock was also stalked by Thomas James Weldon, commencing in 2002, across several states. In 2003, Bullock obtained a restraining order against Weldon, which was renewed again in 2006. After the renewed restraining order expired, and Weldon was released from a mental institution, he again traveled across several states to find Bullock, and she was forced to obtain another restraining order.[98]
Bullock has been a public supporter of the American Red Cross, having donated $1 million to the organization at least four times. Her first public donation of that amount was to the Red Cross's Liberty Disaster Relief Fund. Three years later, she sent money in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunamis.[99] In 2010, she donated $1 million to relief efforts in Haiti following the Haiti earthquake, and again donated the same amount following the 2011 Japan Earthquake.[100]
Along with other stars, Bullock did a public service announcement urging people to sign a petition for clean-up efforts of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.[101] Bullock backs the Texas non-profit organization The Kindred Life Foundation, Inc. In late 2008, she joined other top celebrities in supporting the work of CEO and Founder Amos Ramirez. She shared this at a gala that raised money for the organization, "Amos has led many efforts across our nation that have helped families that are in need. Our country needs more organizations that are committed to the service that Kindred Life is."[102]

1970sImported from GermanyJohn (a government administrator and voice coach) and Helga (a German opera singer) shuttle their teenage daughters, Sandra and Gesine, between Europe and the Washington, D.C. area. "I landed back in the United States hitting puberty, not looking like an American kid," she tells PEOPLE in 2007 of her time in Arlington, Va. "And everything in junior high's about how you look. It was hell."1988Bionic DebutNew York Magazine theatre critic John Simon singles out Bullock for her Off-Broadway performance as a Southern belle in No Time Flat. The review helps her land an agent, and soon after she makes her TV acting debut as a crippled girl-turned-bionic woman in NBC's Bionic Showdown: The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman with Lee Majors and Lindsay Wagner (left).1992November 13Finding Love At WorkAfter starring in the short-lived NBC sitcom version of Working Girl, Bullock stars as a nerdy psychobiologist in Love Potion No. 9. While filming, she falls for costar Tate Donovan (right), who she dates for more than three years. "The person who needed me most was always the person I was attracted to," Bullock tells PEOPLE of the split. "My priorities were him first, me second."1993October 08Sly's PartnerBullock squeezes into a skin-tight body suit opposite Sylvester Stallone's in the sci-fi action flick Demolition Man (left), which opens at No. 1 at the box office. Entertainment Weekly says Bullock makes "something out of a nothing role" and "even makes stilted lines like 'I find this lack of stimulus to be truly disappointing' sound natural." 1994June 10Speeding Bus DriverIn the action movie Speed, Keanu Reeves (right) recruits Bullock to drive a bomb-rigged bus, and in the chaos, they fall in love. "Everyone told me not to do Speed," she tells The Virginian-Pilot. "I mean, it looked like I'd be just 'the girl,' [but] I've learned to do things by instinct." The film grosses more than $121 million at the box office, and while Reeves doesn't return for the disappointing sequel, the two stars reunite for the romantic drama The Lake House in 2006. 1995April 21Switching GearsBullock plays a hopeless romantic who pretends to be the fiancée of a coma patient in the romantic comedy While You Were Sleeping (left), which opens at No. 1 in the box office. "I think people are under some misapprehension that what she's doing on-screen is just being herself," writer-director Marc Lawrence later tells Vogue. "I've always felt, because of her ability to do physical comedy, that she is the reincarnation of Lucille Ball." 1996July 24In Love...with AustinBullock stars with Matthew McConaughey (left) in A Time to Kill, and they are linked romantically for the remainder of the 90s. "I just look at her and I think, Wow!" McConaughey tells In Style. "But she doesn't know how beautiful she is or how much people like her. She's just so regular about everything." In 1998, Bullock moves near McConaughey in Austin, Texas, where she builds a home and eventually opens a Cajun-inspired restaurant. "You never know when you'll fall in love; you don't expect it. And I fell in love with Austin," Bullock tells In Style. "I've gone there to build my home. My roots. I'm building a home there with family in mind, children and grandchildren." 1998Taking ChargeBullock forms her own production company Fortis Films, which her younger sister Gesine (right) helps run. She writes, produces, directs and stars in the 30-minute short Making Sandwiches with McConaughey. After it screens at Sundance, Bullock signs a three-year production deal at Warner Bros, which proves fruitful with seven movies, all starring Bullock, including Hope Floats and Two Weeks Notice, that rake in a total of $700 million at the box office, plus $255 million in DVDs by 2007, according to Forbes.2000December 22Miss CongenialityBullock plays a frumpy FBI agent who goes undercover at a beauty pageant in Miss Congeniality, also starring Benjamin Bratt and Michael Caine. The film, coproduced by Bullock's production company Fortis Films, earns more than $106 million at the box office and she reprises her role for 2005's Miss Congeniality: Armed and Fabulous. 2002MarchSandy the TV ProducerAfter meeting stand-up comedian George Lopez at one of his gigs, Bullock develops a sitcom for him. "Who would have thought that my life would go from 'me, me, me' to 'George, George, George,'" Bullock jokes to Variety in 2001. She executive produces the Latino sitcom, George Lopez (left), which runs for six successful seasons on ABC.

=======================================================
                From kooky love-interest in Speed to recovering alcoholic in 28 Days and hard-nosed detective in Murder By Numbers, this congenial brunette is now a bankable box-office star.Sandra Bullock has come a long way since small roles in the 80's reunion of the TV series 'Bionic Man and Bionic Woman'. Her breakthrough movie was the high velocity, high concept thriller 'Speed' (1994) co-starring Keanu Reeves, which catapulted the then thirty-year old actress into a string of big budget action flicks and dramas. Eleven years after 'Speed', having won plaudits for several roles, including a supporting one in the acclaimed 'Crash', the actress was to team up again with Reeves in the time travel romance 'The Lake House'. However, this time Bullock's earning power and box office bankability was now on par with her co-star.  The actress was born on 26 July 1964 in Arlington, Virginia, to father John who was an employee of the US army and part-time voice coach, and mother Helga who was an opera singer. As a result of her mother's career, a young Sandra spent time in Salzburg and Nuremberg while accompanying her mother on tour. She learnt German on her travels.  Having a vocal coach for a father and an opera singing mother no doubt helped nurture Bullock's creative talents as a child. Sandra spent her early years in Germany and, although not particularly noted for her singing skills, aged twelve she began performing on stage as part of a children's choir.  She also accompanied and performed with her mother, Helga Meyer, during many of her opera tours throughout Europe. Sadly Helga died from cancer in 2000. Also during her youth, Bullock studied ballet before attending Washington-Lee High School in Arlington County, Virginia where the family had moved to from Germany.  After arriving in Los Angeles Bullock, later to be voted twice by 'People' magazine as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in the World, began her early career with small roles in TV shows and remakes of movies. One of these was a television version of the hit 80's movie 'Working Girl' that originally starred Melanie Griffith. Further TV roles continued with Jackie Collins' Dynasty style 'sex and casino' mini series romp, 'Lucky Chances' where Bullock played one exotic Maria Santangelo, who, according to one critic was "lucky enough to die after the end of part one".  Despite appearances in pap TV, Bullock made a smart move into independent films where she could get her teeth into meatier roles. 'Who Shot Patakango?' (1989) was such a movie – a low budget, 'coming of age' drama set in the 50's. Although it didn't attract great reviews or set the box office alight, the film was a stepping stone for Bullock to more promising pastures and a much needed respite from the sausage factory of mini series and TV movies.  That's not to say Bullock didn't appear in her fair share of celluloid turkeys. The unfunny and pedestrian comedy 'Religion Inc' (1989) moved one reviewer to warn potential patrons to 'avoid it like the plague'.  Other equally mediocre fare included 'When The Party's Over' (1992), a 'sex and friendship in the 90's' movie where Sandra played one of an ensemble of youngsters living in a posh LA house.  On her journey to becoming America's darling, girl-next-door star, Bullock's early roles usually saw her playing tough, but cute, New Yorkers. But Sandra's ability to melt audience's hearts and stir the loins of heterosexual men – without annoying their girlfriends too much - meant that even light fantasy comedies such as 'Love Potion No 9' were popular at the box office. Bullock's ability to shine in even the most crass of popcorn entertainment demonstrated that she had star quality that was eventually going to be noticed by the big players. Mobster movie 'Who Do I Got To Kill?' (1992) was an example of how Bullock, despite only given a small role, managed to make it memorable.  'The Vanishing' (1993), a remake of an acclaimed German film, saw Bullock starring opposite Jeff Bridges and Kiefer Sutherland. The disturbing mystery-thriller was to be the springboard for Bullock's career into the big-time as her next movie 'Demolition Man', a mega-budget sci-fi action affair, finally brought her international recognition. This goofy and expensive 21st Century cop movie starring Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes, was the pre-breakthrough movie Bullock needed to attract, if not better roles, certainly ones that were more generously paid. From being paid less than $300,000 in 1995 for the cyberspace thriller 'The Net', Sandra's wage jumped by several million the following year.  1994 was Sandra's year as she and action star Keanu Reeves cleaned up at the box office with the high velocity movie, 'Speed'. This exhilarating thriller embraced the high concept 'bomb on a bus' scenario all too literally. After the film's huge success, Bullock found herself in a string of successes with 'While You Were Sleeping' and 'A Time To Kill' (1996) from novelist John Grisham's best seller.  Part of Bullock's success is no doubt down to her on-screen versatility, where she can play high-end drama, but also turn to knockabout comedy with equal confidence. From gritty strong dramas such as '28 Days' (2000) to screwball capers like 'Miss Congeniality' (2000) where Sandra plays an undercover FBI agent in a beauty pageant, she is able to demonstrate an impressive aptitude for all genres.  Bullock's talent to constantly surprise her audiences has contributed to her ongoing success and encouraged casting her in socially challenging and Academy Award winning dramas such as 'Crash' (2004) which is said to be one of her finest performances yet.  Ironically, Bullock originally tried to produce the award winning 'Million Dollar Baby' movie through her own production company Fortis Films. At the time of pitching the idea the actress turned producer found studios uninterested in female boxing. Several years later the movie was later to be directed by Clint Eastwood and brought about Oscar awards both for him and the movie's young star Hilary Swank. In 2009, Bullock starred opposite Ryan Reynolds in the hugely successful romantic comedy 'The Proposal'. The movie made more than $314 million at the box office worldwide. Later that year the actress starred in 'The Blind Side', which was a success both critically and commercially. Despite previously turning down the role, Bullock went on to win the award for best actress at the Academy Awards, Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild. Although 2010 was a good year in the actress' professional life, things in her personal life took a turn for the worse. In April 2010, Bullock filed for divorce from her husband Jesse James following rumours of infidelity. In a statement James said he was the "only person to blame" for the situation and hoped that one day his family would "find it in their hearts to forgive" him. The actress announced that same year that she had adopted a baby boy named Louis who was born in New Orleans. She is now raising him as a single parent. Despite the problems in her personal life, Bullock has continued to appear in successful films including 'Extremely Loud and Close' in 2011, which tells the story of a nine-year-old amateur inventor searching for the lock that matches a mysterious key left behind by his father who died in Twin Tower attacks. She is next set to appear in 'Gravity' with George Clooney in 2013 playing a scientist trying to help astronauts attempting to return to earth. Bullock is currently filming 'Heat', which is set for release next year. Bullock has donated large amounts of money to charity over the course of her career, including millions of dollars to the American Red Cross. In 2010 she gave $1 million to help relief efforts following the Haiti earthquake. The following year the actress donated $1 million to support those affected by the earthquake in Japan.

Birth Name: Sandra Annette BullockBirth Place: Arlington, VADate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 07/26/1964, LeoProfession: Actor; producer
After getting her start on stage, this spunky actress with a girl-next-door persona started to land film and TV parts in the late 1980s. She came to prominence in 1993 with a number of flashy movie roles, including an aspiring country singer in The Thing Called Love (in which she performed her own song "Heaven Knocking on My Door") and a perky police officer in the big-budget sci-fi flick Demolition Man. The next year, she was the female lead in the blockbuster Speed. However, it was her performance as a lovelorn token-booth clerk in the surprise 1995 hit While You Were Sleeping that turned her into a romantic-comedy favorite. After releasing a few missteps (Two if by Sea, Practical Magic, 28 Days), Bullock began producing her own vehicles through her company Fortis Films. But her draw as a romantic lead remained and she had more hits on her hands with the fluffy comedy Miss Congeniality (2000) and her collaboration with Hugh Grant in Two Weeks Notice (2002). She then turned in a well-received performance in a supporting role for 2004's ensemble drama Crash. Off screen, the winsome actress was romantically linked with many of her costars, including former fiancé Tate Donovan (Love Potion No. 9), Matthew McConaughey (A Time to Kill) and Ryan Gosling (Murder by Numbers), before marrying tattooed motorcycle maven and Monster Garage star Jesse James in 2005. The next year, she reteamed with her Speed costar Keanu Reeves for the time-traveling romance The Lake House, but it was 2009 that proved to be her biggest year to date. The romantic comedy The Proposal was a smash at the box office, and her role as a devout Christian who takes in a down-on-his-luck teen in The Blind Side had critics buzzing. Indeed, she went on to win the Oscar for her performance, as well as the unusual distinction of winning best and worst actress (she took home the Razzie for All About Steve) in the same year. Sadly, mere days after her Oscar win, stories of Jesse's infidelity emerged, leading to their eventual divorce. However, Bullock still had reason to smile- she brought home her adopted her son Louis in January 2010, keeping it a secret until after the Oscar ceremony.Sandra Bullock Fast Facts:
In 1997, wrote, produced, directed and costarred in (opposite then-boyfriend, Matthew McConaughey) a short film called Making Sandwiches.
