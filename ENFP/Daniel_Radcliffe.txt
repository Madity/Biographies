 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Daniel Jacob Radcliffe was born on July 23rd, 1989 to Alan Radcliffe and Marcia Gresham. His father is from a Northern Irish Protestant background, while his mother was born in South Africa, to a Jewish family (from Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Germany). Daniel began performing in small school productions as a young boy. Soon enough, he landed a role in David Copperfield (1999), as the young David Copperfield. A couple of years later, he landed a role as Mark Pendel in The Tailor of Panama (2001), the son of Harry and Louisa Pendel (Geoffrey Rush and Jamie Lee Curtis). Lee Curtis had indeed pointed out to Daniel's mother that he could be Harry Potter himself. Soon afterwards, Daniel was cast as Harry Potter by director, Chris Columbus in the film that hit theatres in November 16, 2001, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001). He was recognized worldwide after this film was released. Pleasing audiences and critics everywhere, filming on its sequel, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), commenced shortly afterwards. He appeared again as Harry in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) directed by Alfonso Cuarón, and then appeared in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) directed by Mike Newell. Shortly afterwards, he finished filming December Boys (2007) in Adelaide, Australia, Kangaroo Island, and Geelong, Australia which began on the 14th of November, 2005 and ended sometime in December. On January 27th, 2006, he attended the South Bank Awards Show to present the award for "Breakthrough Artist of the Year" to Billie Piper. Dan reprised his famous character once again for the next installment of the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007). In February 2007, he took on his first stage role in the West End play Equus, to worldwide praise from fans and critics alike. Also that year, he starred in the television movie My Boy Jack (2007), which aired on 11 November 2007 in the UK.Now being one of the world's most recognizable people, Daniel leads a somewhat normal life. He has made friends working on the Harry Potter films, which include his co-stars Rupert Grint and Emma Watson.
      Liked to play pranks when he was 10. He took co-star Robbie Coltrane's cellular phone and changed it so all the messages were in Turkish.
      Tried reading the first Harry Potter book when he was 8 years old, but was unable to finish it. Finally read the entire book when he was cast in the lead role of the film.
      His favorite book from the Harry Potter series so far is number three, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.
      In February 2002, he was nominated for and won "Best Newcomer" at the Variety Club Award ceremonies.
      Received the Sir James Carreras Award For Outstanding New Talent for his role in Harry Potter at The Variety Club Showbusiness Awards 2002.
      Has stated that 12 Angry Men (1957) is the first black & white film he ever saw and is also his favorite film.
David Heyman, the producer for the Harry Potter films happened to be at a play that both Dan and Dan's father, Alan Radcliffe, were at. After Heyman spotted Radcliffe, since both men knew each other, he was introduced to his son and when Heyman saw Daniel he thought he looked perfect for the part. In fact, that night at the play, Heyman couldn't help just staring at Dan because he thought he was perfect to play Harry. Daniel auditioned for and got the part that he is now most recognized for, Harry Potter.
      A February 23, 2004 article in British newspaper 'The Sun' listed him as Britain's third richest teenager behind only Prince Harry Windsor and Charlotte Church. He is said to be worth 5 million pounds.
      Has earned 6 million pounds so far portraying Harry Potter, making him the second richest teenager in Britain behind Prince Harry Windsor's 14 million pounds.
      Is a big fan of Gary Oldman, his co-star in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005), and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007).
      Is a supporter of Fulham Football Club although he doesn't enjoy playing football himself. Fellow fans include Elizabeth Hurley, Lily Allen, Pierce Brosnan, Hugh Grant, Benicio Del Toro, Hugh Laurie, Andrew Johnston and the late Michael Jackson.
      Favorite actors include Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Christina Ricci, Cameron Diaz, Scarlett Johansson and Ben Stiller.
      He is a fan of indie rock. Some of his favorite bands include: The Zutons, Razorlight, The Libertines, Bloc Party, Hope of the States, The Futureheads and 'Kaiser Chiefs'.
      Delays between filming the second and third Harry Potter movies were caused because his parents wanted him to be able to attend normal school for a while.
      He supports Demelza House Children's Hospice, which is a charity that cares for terminally-ill children in the Kent, East Sussex and South London areas of Britain. Dan always asks his fans to donate to the charity every Christmas and on his birthday instead of sending him gifts. In the book, 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince', the author J.K. Rowling named the character Demelza Robins after the charity.
      [May/June 2006] He sat his AS Levels in English Literature, History, and Religion and Philosophy for his AS levels (First year college exams).
      Named Britain's richest teenager with an astounding 23 million pound fortune, after he signed on a 8 million pound deal to make the fifth movie of the Harry Potter series.
      Dan scared the make-up department crew when he came on set with bloodied sticking plasters on his face claiming that he had been fighting the previous day (just for a laugh).
      Before working with Brendan Gleeson in the Harry Potter series, he worked with him in The Tailor of Panama (2001).
      23 July 2007 - Appeared on BBC Radio's Test Match Special, from Lords, London, on the final day of the England v. India test match. It was his 18th birthday and he was a guest on "View from the Boundary" hosted by Jonathan Agnew, the BBC's cricket correspondent. He talked about his career to date, his love of cricket and his admiration for the grit of his favorite player Paul Collingwood. He appeared a second time in 2009 accompanied by fellow Potter cast member Tom Felton who plays Draco Malfoy.
      His agent Sue Latimer is the mother (and agent) to his friend and fellow actor Freddie Highmore.
      In the 2003 Comic Relief fundraiser, a lock of Dan's hair sold at auction for 751 British pounds, the highest amount raised.
      In 2008, Dan and the cast of Equus raised $203,746 for the charity, BroadwayCares/EquityFightsAids 20th Gypsy of the Year competition, setting a record for the most ever raised by a Broadway play. They not only beat the amount raised by other Broadway musicals but also came runner up for the best presentation, again beating out every other musical with their own song and dance. (The winning presentation was the Lion King's). Dan wrote and sang the song. http://www.broadwaycares.org/events/gypsy.cfm.
      The Guardian (UK) reported that Radcliffe has published some poetry under the pen name "Jacob Gershon." Jacob is his middle name, and Gershon is the original Yiddish name from which his mother's maiden name, Gresham, was derived.
      In August 2009, The Trevor Project announced that Daniel Radcliffe had made a "major" donation to them and joined their "Circle of Hope," a group of their high-donating supporters. The Trevor Project operates a national (US) crisis and suicide prevention helpline for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning (LGBTQ) youth (who are four times more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual children and teens). The Trevor Project was inspired by the short film Trevor (1994), about a gay boy who attempts suicide; the organization was started by the film's creators in 1998.
      Is a huge fan of mathematician/singer/songwriter Tom Lehrer and can recite his famous 'The Elements' song.
      Is a huge fan of cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar and waited in line for his autograph after the Lords test in July 2007. Sachin obliged without actually looking up.
      Plays the son of Adrian Rawlins in the Harry Potter films. The Woman in Black (2012) is a remake of an earlier film (The Woman in Black (1989)), in which Radcliffe takes over the role originally played by Rawlins.
      When he was first cast as Harry Potter, the filmmakers tried using contact lenses to make his eyes appear green; as they are described in the books; rather than their natural blue. Daniel suffered a painful allergic reaction when he tried them on, so the idea was scrapped. The filmmakers then considered digitally altering his eyes in post-production, but knew this would be a tedious process. The filmmakers then approached J.K. Rowling with their problem, and she thankfully told them that it was not essential for Harry to have green eyes, merely that he have his mother's eyes, much to the relief of all involved.
      Became the youngest non-royal to have an individual portrait displayed in London's prestigious National Portrait Gallery. Radcliffe was only 14-years-old when he posed for artist Stuart Pearson Wright during a break from filming Harry Potter.
      Preparing for the new Broadway revival of "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" [June 2010]
      Playing Alan Strang in the London West End production of Equus with Joanna Christie. [February 2007]
      After being cast as Harry Potter: "I think I'm a tiny bit like Harry 'cos I'd like to have an owl. Yeah, that's the tiny bit, actually."
      I don't know. People tell me I look mournful. They say, "Cheer up, Dan, it's not that bad!" Sometimes I just look into space, which freaks people out. If I was ever required to do anything other than look haunted, I could. I'm a happy person. Though I don't, like, dot my "I's" with hearts or anything - that would be too happy.
      But I don't think it's going to happen. I don't think I'll do all of them - I'll probably get too spotty or too tall or I'll shrink or something.
      I was in the bath at the time, and my dad came running in and said, 'Guess who they want to play Harry Potter!?' and I started to cry. It was probably the best moment of my life.
      Upon seeing the movie: "I'm a bit nervous about whether people will like it, but I've seen it, and I'm sure they will. It's really good - it's quite scary, it's quite emotional. Even I cried and I don't cry easily! I cried at the end credits when my name came up, and I was, like, Oh my God! I can't believe that's my name! I've met so many people since we started filming and it's been wonderful. I've progressed so far and changed so much since the beginning. It's been like a real journey."
      On considering himself as a heartthrob: "Personally I can't see it, but if other people can, fine. Cool!"
      I would consider doing any part as long as the script is good and the film has an interesting director.
      I like them, but it's hard to concentrate when the bats fly about, and they pee while they fly. [about the bats on the set]
      I've never been one of the cool people at school, but then again, I don't get the people who are cool. It's not that I don't like them, it's just that they don't interest me.
      Stage is much more intimidating than going before the cameras, because you can really screw up, and can't do a retake.
      When I go back to school everyone asks a lot of questions. Then, after about a week, when I've answered everything, we get back to normal.
      It's too far down the road to decide about a fifth movie. I'm still the same age Harry is, and I haven't actually grown that much.
      Fans are really important for me. And if they take pains to write me, it's the minimum that I answer myself.
      I think I'm highly normal. I'm attending school after acting, I'm going out with friends, going to the cinema - I'm just doing everything a normal teenager does. People think I can't leave the house without being in a crowd of fans - but that's not true. I'm able to do more things than people might think.
      I'm thrilled of the acceptance I get abroad. The people are so hearty, warm and grateful and I feel privileged having seen so many countries and some of the greatest monuments.
      When I get into trouble at school I'd like to take an invisibility cloak, drape it over me and sneak out the door. Or I'd like to have a 3-headed-dog because then no one would argue with me.
      I played a trick on the make-up department where I put a fake blood capsule in my mouth, pretended to trip on the stairs and let the blood come out of my mouth. They really fell for it, then they chased after me with a water pistol.
      Everyone on the set has a mobile phone, and I found by pushing a few buttons, they could be programmed into different languages. I fixed Robbie's (Coltrane) to speak in Turkish.
      [on saying that he'll do all of the Harry Potter movies] "Ultimately it comes down to whether we're still enjoying it. If we are then I think we would be sort of stupid not to do them. As long as I'm doing other stuff around the same time, I think it'll be fine. Also, I sort of try to read the books when they come out impartially and not make up my mind, but the fact is when I was reading the sixth, Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince, there were bits in there where I was going, 'God, I would love to do that because it's so good.'"
      (on whether he is religious) "I'm not a religious person. My mom was of Jewish blood and my dad was Protestant... I'm very interested in religion as something to study, but I'm not a religious person in the slightest."
      I didn't look at the nudity and go, oh great. But it's the same as doing a role with an accent or a particular affectation. You look at the character first. Lots of the actors that I've admired have at one stage or another taken their kit off. It's a rite of passage. That iconic scene is the physical and emotional climax of the play. So if I do that with pants on, it would be crap.
      I feel OK about my body. Not totally, of course, no one my age does ... but I've gone to the gym to make sure. And many of the actors I admire, like Gary Oldman, have gone naked.
      People will always remember Harry, but I think if I work hard enough other characters will stick in their minds as well.
      [About the "Equus" paparazzi]: They were outside the theatre every single night, but we came up with a cunning ruse. I would wear the same outfit every time - a different T-shirt underneath, but I'd wear the same jacket and zip it up so they couldn't see what I was wearing underneath, and the same hat. So they could take pictures for six months, but it would look like the same day, so they (photos) became unpublishable. Which was hilarious, because there's nothing better than seeing paparazzi getting really frustrated.
      What everybody would love to see is me having ditched school and then just going wild. That's what I'm determined not to give them.
      It's not so much that they don't want me to grow up. It's that they're annoyed that I'm growing up adjusted. They'd much rather I was growing up and going wild and crashing cars.
      (On being bullied in school) Some people did get very aggressive. People say it was just jealousy, but I don't think it is jealousy. I think it's just 'We can have a crack at the kid who plays Harry Potter.' As Eddie Izzard says, these people always hang about in fives, because people these have a fifth of a personality each.
      I hate celebrity culture but I'm unavoidably part of it. These people are celebrities as a by-product of what they do. People read every little thing about Peter Andre and Katie Price and I couldn't care less. They don't want to work, have no interests, no passions, nothing and yet they seem to be held up on pedestals. I don't think they should be trying to push themselves onto us. It does annoy me of course, but I'm part of it.
      [on quitting drinking alcohol]: I became so reliant on (alcohol) to enjoy stuff. There were a few years there when I was just so enamored with the idea of living some sort of famous person's lifestyle that really isn't suited to me. As much as I would love to be a person that goes to parties and has a couple of drinks and has a nice time - that doesn't work for me. I do that very unsuccessfully. I'd just rather sit at home and read, or go out to dinner with someone, or talk to someone I love, or talk to somebody that makes me laugh.
      When growing up, I thought of marriage as being very official, drawing up a contract. It seemed slightly clinical to me. But then you meet somebody that you really love and you think, 'Actually, I wouldn't mind standing up in front of my friends and family and telling them how much I love you and that I want to be with you forever.'
      We like tearing down our own in England. If you look at what happened to Ken Branagh in the 1990s: all of the newspapers built him up, the new Olivier, and then destroyed him and his personal life. Not that I have been treated that badly, but I think a lot of people would like to write that story.
      [on receiving the script for 'The Woman in Black'] It was a page-turner. What I liked about it was that it was a horror film, but it was unusual for a horror film to be so character-driven, to have such deep and affecting themes - themes of loss and what happens when we fail to move on from the loss.
      [on occasionally being drunk while impersonating Harry Potter] I can point to many scenes where I am just gone. Dead behind the eyes.
      I don't have an entourage in my personal life. I get driven here and I get driven home, but that's it. I hate that kind of dropping-a-name-to-get-a-table stuff. Maybe it's an English thing that there's some sort of embarrassment saying, 'Hello, I'm Daniel Radcliffe, does that make a difference to you?'.
      [on many parents' objecting to 'The Woman in Black'] I do take a small tincture of pride about it being the most complained-about film. I would have thought from the trailer that you could see what kind of a movie it was going to be. I said at the time, if your kid is under twelve I would advise them not to see this film. Apparently there was a girl at the British premiere who fainted and when I heard that, I was like, 'We did something right'.
      I'm scared of any sort of expression looking like a Harry expression, and so I think that the journey for me in the last year is kind of about acceptance, of going, 'This is my face and it was also the face that played Harry Potter'.
      [on whether he identifies as Jewish] Absolutely. I really do. My dad is Northern Irish and my mum is Jewish. That's working blood. Though I am not religious in the least, I am very proud to be Jewish.
      [on rumors he was going to play Freddie Mercury in a biopic] There is no truth to it at all. It's one of those very, very funny things: it came out of a story in the Daily Star and then you see newspapers like The Guardian using The Star as their source, and it grows and grows [until] it's 'Dan Radcliffe is playing Freddie Mercury!', which I was never going to do. Everyone on the Internet who I presume is saying I'm totally wrong for that part is correct. I AM completely wrong for that part!
      I don't have Twitter and I don't have Facebook and I think that makes things a lot easier, because if you go on Twitter and tell everybody what you're doing moment to moment and then claim you want a private life, then no one is going to take that request seriously.

Daniel Jacob Radcliffe (born 23 July 1989) is an English actor who rose to prominence as the title character in the Harry Potter film series. He made his acting debut at 10 years of age in BBC One's 1999 television movie David Copperfield, followed by his film debut in 2001's The Tailor of Panama. At age 11, he was cast as Harry Potter in the first Harry Potter film, and starred in the series for 10 years until the release of the eighth and final film in 2011.
Radcliffe began to branch out to stage acting in 2007, starring in the London and New York productions of Equus, and in the 2011 Broadway revival of the musical How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. He starred in the 2012 horror film The Woman in Black, and played beat poet Allen Ginsberg in the 2013 independent film Kill Your Darlings. He has contributed to many charities, including Demelza House Children's Hospice and The Trevor Project. He also made public service announcements for the latter. In 2011, he was awarded the Trevor Project's "Hero Award."
Radcliffe was born in West London, England.[1] He is the only child of Alan George Radcliffe, a literary agent, and Marcia Jeannine Gresham (née Marcia Gresham Jacobson), a casting agent who was involved in several films for the BBC, including The Inspector Lynley Mysteries and Walk Away and I Stumble.[2][3] His father is from "a very working-class" Protestant background in Banbridge, County Down, Northern Ireland.[4][5] His mother is Jewish; she was born in South Africa and raised in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex. Her family had originally come from Poland and Russia.[6][7] Radcliffe's parents had both acted as children.[8]
Radcliffe first expressed a desire to act at the age of five,[9] and in December 1999, aged 10, he made his acting debut in BBC One's televised two-part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield, portraying the title character as a young boy.[10] He was educated at two independent schools for boys:[11] Sussex House School, a day school in Chelsea's Cadogan Square,[12] and the City of London School, a day school on the North Bank of the River Thames in London's financial district (known as the City of London).[13] Attending school became difficult for Radcliffe after the release of the first Harry Potter film, with some fellow pupils becoming hostile, though he says it was people just trying to "have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter" rather than jealousy.[14]
As his acting career began to consume his schedule, Radcliffe continued his education through on-set tutors. He admitted he was not very good at school, considering it useless and finding the work "really difficult."[11] He achieved A grades in the three AS-level exams that he took in 2006, but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university.[15][16] Part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write, and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience. "The paparazzi, they'd love it," he told Details magazine in 2007. "If there were any parties going on, they'd be tipped off as to where they were."[14]
In 2000, producer David Heyman asked Radcliffe to audition for the role of Harry Potter for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the best-selling book by British author J. K. Rowling.[17][18] Rowling had been searching for an unknown British actor to personify the character; however, Radcliffe's parents did not want him to audition for the role, as the contract required shooting all seven films in Los Angeles, California, and so they did not tell him.[19] The movie's director Chris Columbus recalled thinking, "This is what I want. This is Harry Potter", after he saw a video of the young actor in David Copperfield.[19] Eight months later, and after several auditions, Radcliffe was selected to play the part.[20] Rowling also endorsed the selection saying, "I don't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry."[21] Radcliffe's parents originally turned down the offer, as they had been told that it would involve six films shot in Los Angeles.[22] Warner Bros. instead offered Radcliffe a two-movie contract with shooting in the UK though,[19] when signing up, Radcliffe was unsure if he would do any more pictures.[23]
The release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (released as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the United States) took place in 2001. The story follows Harry, a young boy who learns he is a wizard and is sent to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to begin his education; gaining the help of friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) along the way. Radcliffe received a seven figure salary for the lead role, but asserted that the fee was "not that important" to him;[24] his parents chose to invest the money for him.[19] The film broke records for opening-day sales and opening-weekend takings, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2001. With a total of US$974 million in ticket sales, Philosopher's Stone stands as the second most commercially successful in the series behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, the final instalment.[25]
The adaptation was met with positive reviews and critics took notice of Radcliffe:[26] "Radcliffe is the embodiment of every reader's imagination. It is wonderful to see a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions, from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing," wrote Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle.[27]
A year later Radcliffe starred in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second instalment of the series. Reviewers were positive about the lead actors' performances but had polarised opinions on the movie as a whole. Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post labelled it "big, dull and empty".[28] Observing that Radcliffe and his peers had matured, Los Angeles Times's staff writer Kenneth Turan believed the novel's magic could not be successfully duplicated in the film.[29] Nonetheless, it still managed to earn US$878 million, taking the second spot of the highest-grossing 2002 films worldwide behind The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.[30]
The 2004 release Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the third film in the series. While garnering the highest critical acclaim of the series at that point[26] and grossing US$795.6 million worldwide, the film's performance at the box office ranks the lowest in the series.[25] Radcliffe's performance was panned by New York Times journalist A. O. Scott, who wrote that Watson had to carry him with her performance.[31] Next was Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in 2005. The film set records for a Harry Potter opening weekend, as well as for a non-May opening weekend in the US and in the UK.[32] The film eventually grossed US$896 million worldwide, and the film was the second-highest grossing Harry Potter film at that point.[33] In a 2005 interview, Radcliffe singled out the humour as being a reason for the movie's creative success.[34]
Despite the success of the previous three movies, the future of the franchise was put into question when all three lead actors were unsure about signing on to continue their roles for the final two episodes; however, by 2 March 2007 Radcliffe had signed for the final films, which put an end to weeks of press "speculation that he would be denied the role due to his involvement in Equus".[35] Radcliffe reprised his role for the fourth time in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007), which details Harry's return to Hogwarts after his encounter with Lord Voldemort in the previous film. It opened to positive responses from the press;[26] IGN movie critic Steven Horn found Order of the Phoenix to be one of "those rare films that exceeds the source material"[36] and Colin Bertram of New York's Daily News dubbed it the best movie in the series.[37] Radcliffe stated that director David Yates and actress Imelda Staunton made Order of the Phoenix the "most fun" film in the series to work on.[38] His performance earned several award nominations, and he received the 2008 National Movie Award for "Best Male Performance."[39] As his fame and the series continued, Radcliffe, Grint and Watson left imprints of their hands, feet, and wands in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.[40]
In July 2009 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was released, the series' sixth instalment. The film did considerably better than the previous movie, breaking the then-record for biggest midnight US showings with US$22.2 million at 3,000 theatres,[41] and was the biggest ever Wednesday-opening in the UK, with US$7.6 million at 1,305 screens.[42] Half-Blood Prince achieved a total of US$933 million ticket sales[25] and was one of the most positively reviewed of the series among film critics, who praised the film's "emotionally satisfying" story, direction, cinematography, visuals and music.[43][44][45] Radcliffe received nominations for "Best Male Performance" and "Global Superstar" at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards.[46]
For financial and scripting reasons the last book was divided into two films, shot back to back,[47][48] which drew criticism from the series' fanbase. Radcliffe defended the split, pointing out that it would have been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film.[49] He added that the last movie was going to be extremely fast-paced with a lot of action, while the first part would be far more sedate, focusing on character development; he added that, had they combined them, those things would not have made it to the final cut.[50] Filming lasted for a year, concluding in June 2010 and on the last day of shooting, like most of the cast and crew, Radcliffe openly wept.[51] Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 (2010) was about Harry, Ron and Hermione leaving Hogwarts to track down Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes, objects in which Voldemort has left part of his soul. The film was released in November and grossed over US$950 million.[25] Its most lucrative territory was the UK, where it reportedly had the highest-grossing three-day opening in history; while its earnings of US$205 million, in 91 markets, made it the highest ever top-grossing non-US opening for a non-summer picture, and "the fourth-biggest-grossing international opening ever."[52] The movie received mostly favourable reviews in the media.[26]
The final film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, was released worldwide starting on 13 July 2011 in Australia. The film concerns the battle against Voldemort's followers in Hogwarts, along with Harry's final climactic duel with Voldemort. Radcliffe, along with the film,[26] was critically acclaimed: Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post asked, "Who could have predicted that Radcliffe, Grint and Watson would turn out to be good actors?";[53] similarly, Rex Reed said: "Frankly, I’m sorry to see [Radcliffe] go";[54] while Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers commented on Radcliffe: "Well played, sir."[55] Roger Ebert gave the film a highly positive review, but felt that Radcliffe, Grint and Watson were "upstaged by the supporting [actors]."[56] The film broke several box office records, including biggest midnight release,[57] biggest first-day opening,[57] and biggest opening-weekend.[58] Deathly Hallows – Part 2 is currently the 4th highest-grossing film of all time with more than US$1.3 billion worldwide.[59]
Radcliffe admitted that some people would never be able to separate him from the character, but also said he is "proud to be associated with this film series forever."[60] Despite positive feelings about the movies, he has no interest in doing more Harry Potter films. After Rowling hinted about writing an eighth book, Radcliffe was asked if he would do another film to which he replied: "[It is] very doubtful. I think 10 years is a long time to spend with one character."[61] Despite devoting so much time to the series, Radcliffe has asserted that he did not miss out on a childhood like other child actors: "I’ve been given a much better perspective on life by doing Potter."[62]
Radcliffe made his film debut in The Tailor of Panama, an American 2001 film based on John le Carré's 1996 spy novel, and a moderate commercial success.[25] In 2002 he made his stage debut as a celebrity guest in a West End theatre production of The Play What I Wrote, directed by Kenneth Branagh – who also appeared with him in the second Harry Potter film.[10][63] In 2007 he appeared in the film December Boys, an Australian family drama about four orphans that was shot in 2005 and released to theatres in mid-September 2007.[64] Also in 2007, Radcliffe co-starred with Carey Mulligan in My Boy Jack, a television drama film shown on ITV on Remembrance Day. The film received mostly positive reviews,[65] with several critics praising Radcliffe's performance as an 18-year-old who goes missing in action during a battle.[66][67][68] Radcliffe stated, "For many people my age, the First World War is just a topic in a history book. But I've always been fascinated by the subject and think it's as relevant today as it ever was."[69]
At age 17, in a bid to show people he was not a kid any more,[1] he performed onstage in Peter Shaffer's play Equus, which had not been revived since its first run in 1973, at the Gielgud Theatre.[19] Radcliffe took on the lead role[63] as Alan Strang, a stable boy who has an obsession with horses. Advance sales topped £1.7 million, and the role generated significant pre-opening media interest, as Radcliffe appeared in a nude scene.[19][70] Equus opened on 27 February 2007 and ran until 9 June 2007.[63] Radcliffe's performance received positive reviews[71] as critics were impressed by the nuance and depth of his against-type role.[72] Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote that he "displays a dramatic power and an electrifying stage presence that marks a tremendous leap forward." He added: "I never thought I would find the diminutive (but perfectly formed) Radcliffe a sinister figure, but as Alan Strang ... there are moments when he seems genuinely scary in his rage and confusion."[73] The production then transferred to Broadway in September 2008, with Radcliffe still in the lead role.[74][75] Radcliffe stated he was nervous about repeating the role on Broadway because he considered American audiences more discerning than those in London.[76] Radcliffe's performance was nominated for a Drama Desk Award.[77]
After voicing a character in an episode of the animated television series The Simpsons in late 2010,[78] Radcliffe debuted as J. Pierrepont Finch in the 2011 Broadway revival How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, a role previously held by Broadway veterans Robert Morse and Matthew Broderick.[79] Other cast members included John Larroquette, Rose Hemingway and Mary Faber.[80] Both the actor and production received favourable reviews,[81] with USA Today commenting: "Radcliffe ultimately succeeds not by overshadowing his fellow cast members, but by working in conscientious harmony with them – and having a blast in the process."[82] Radcliffe's performance in the show earned him Drama Desk Award, Drama League Award and Outer Critics Circle Award nominations.[83][84][85] The production itself later received nine Tony Award nominations.[86] Radcliffe left the show on 1 January 2012.[87]
His first post-Harry Potter project was the 2012 horror film The Woman in Black, adapted from the 1983 novel by Susan Hill. The film was released on 3 February 2012 in the United States and Canada, and was released on 10 February in the UK. Radcliffe portrays a man sent to deal with the legal matters of a mysterious woman who has just died, and soon after he begins to experience strange events and hauntings from the ghost of a woman dressed in black.[88] He has said he was "incredibly excited" to be part of the film and described the script as "beautifully written".[89]
In 2013, he portrayed American poet Allen Ginsberg in the thriller drama Kill Your Darlings, directed by John Krokidas.[90][91] He also starred in What If and Alexandre Aja's Horns.[92][93][94][95] Radcliffe's upcoming roles include the character Igor in Frankenstein[96] and American reporter Jake Adelstein in Tokyo Vice.[97] Radcliffe also performed at the Noël Coward Theatre in the stage play revival of Martin McDonagh's dark comedy The Cripple of Inishmaan as the lead, Billy Claven,[98] for which he won the WhatsOnStage Award for Best Actor in a Play.[99]
In 2008, Radcliffe revealed that he suffers from a mild form of the neurological disorder developmental coordination disorder. The motor skill disorder sometimes gets so bad that he has trouble doing simple activities, such as writing or tying his own shoelaces. "I was having a hard time at school, in terms of being crap at everything, with no discernible talent," Radcliffe commented.[100] In August 2010, he stopped drinking alcohol after finding himself becoming too reliant on it.[101]
In a 2012 interview, Radcliffe stated, "There was never [religious] faith in the house. I think of myself as being Jewish and Irish, despite the fact that I’m English."[8] He says that although he wasn't brought up in the Jewish faith, "we were Christmas tree Jews". He says that he was circumcised "as a baby, and it ended there", that "my dad is also circumcised", and that "even if my kids aren't Jewish, I think I would have them circumcised".[102] Radcliffe has also stated that he is "very proud of being Jewish".[103][104] In April 2012, Shalom Life ranked him Number 10 on its list of "the 50 most talented, intelligent, funny, and gorgeous Jewish men in the world."[105] He has also said, "I'm an atheist, and a militant atheist when religion starts impacting on legislation",[106] and in a separate interview, he stated; "I'm very relaxed about it [being an atheist]. I don't preach my atheism, but I have a huge amount of respect for people like Richard Dawkins who do. Anything he does on television, I will watch".[107][108]
Radcliffe is a supporter of the Labour Party.[109] Until 2012 Radcliffe had publicly supported the Liberal Democrats,[110] and before the 2010 general election Radcliffe endorsed Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader. In 2012, however, Radcliffe switched his allegiance to Labour, citing disappointment with the performance of Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems in government, and approving of the Labour leader, Ed Miliband.[109] He is a supporter of a British Republic [111] At the age of sixteen, Radcliffe became the youngest non-royal ever to have an individual portrait in Britain's National Portrait Gallery (NPG). On 13 April 2006 his portrait, drawn by Stuart Pearson Wright, was unveiled as part of a new exhibition opening at the Royal National Theatre; it was then moved to the NPG where it resides.[112]
In November 2007 Radcliffe published several poems under the pen name Jacob Gershon – a combination of his middle name and the Jewish version of his mother's maiden name Gresham – in Rubbish, an underground fashion magazine.[104][113] He has a close friendship with his Harry Potter co-stars Tom Felton[114] and Emma Watson,[115] and is tight-knit with his family, whom he credits for keeping him grounded.[116]

Speaking out against homophobia, Radcliffe began filming public service announcements in 2009 for The Trevor Project, promoting awareness of gay teen suicide prevention.[117][118] He first learned of the organisation while working on Equus on Broadway in 2008[118] and has contributed financially to it.[119] "I have always hated anybody who is not tolerant of gay men or lesbians or bisexuals. Now I am in the very fortunate position where I can actually help or do something about it," he said in a 2010 interview. In the same interview, he spoke of the importance of public figures advocating for equal rights.[118] Radcliffe considers his involvement to be one of the most important things in his career and,[117] for his work for the organisation, he was given the "Hero Award" in 2011.[117]
Radcliffe has supported various charities. He designed the Cu-Bed for Habitat's VIP Kids range (a cube made of eight smaller ones which can be made into a bed, chaise-longue or chair)[120] with all the royalties from the sale of the bed going directly to his favourite charity, Demelza House Children's Hospice in Sittingbourne, Kent.[121] Radcliffe has urged his fans to make donations, in lieu of Christmas presents to him, to the charity's Candle for Care program. In 2008 he was among several celebrities who donated their old glasses to an exhibit honouring victims of the Holocaust.[122] During the Broadway run of Equus he auctioned off a pair of jeans he wore in the show for "thousands of dollars", as well as other items worn in the show, for the Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS "a New York-based nonprofit HIV/AIDS grant-making organisation".[123] He has also donated money to Get Connected UK, a London-based free confidential national helpline for troubled youth.[124]
Sources disagree about Radcliffe's personal wealth; he was reported to have earned £1 million for the first Harry Potter film[24] and around £15 million for the sixth.[11] Radcliffe appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List in 2006, which estimated his personal fortune to be £14 million, making him one of the richest young people in the UK.[125] In March 2009 he was ranked number one on the Forbes "Most Valuable Young Stars" list,[126] and by April The Daily Telegraph measured his net worth at £30m, making him the 12th richest young person in the UK.[127] Radcliffe was considered to be the richest teenager in England later that year.[11] In February 2010 he was named the sixth highest paid Hollywood male star[128] and placed at number five on Forbes's December list of Hollywood's highest-grossing actors[note 1] with a film revenue of US$780 million, mainly due to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows being released that year.[129]
Radcliffe maintains a home in the West Village of Lower Manhattan in New York City.[130] As of October 2012, Radcliffe has been dating Erin Darke, whom he met on the set of Kill Your Darlings.[131]

1999Daniel Does CopperfieldActing casts its spell early on Daniel Radcliffe, the son of Alan, a literary agent, and Marcia, a casting director. At 10, he clinches the lead role in a BBC adaptation of Charles Dickens' David Copperfield, alongside veteran costars Bob Hoskins (left) and Maggie Smith. "My mum sent in a Polaroid of me to the BBC, because I've always wanted to act since I was five," he tells the Press Association in 2000. "My mum and dad never thought it was a very good idea. So I went for about five auditions and then I got the part."circa 2000Becoming Harry PotterChris Columbus, who's signed on to direct Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (based on author J.K. Rowling's book about a boy wizard named Harry Potter), sees Radcliffe in the Dickens film. "This is what I want," Columbus (right) recalls to the Independent on Sunday in 2007. "This is Harry Potter." Radcliffe is in the bath when he hears he'd been cast. "I just cried – it was so cool," he tells the Ottawa Sun. 2000sGrowing Up HogwartsRadcliffe spends the next several years on Potter sets with Rupert Grint, who plays Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson, who plays Hermione Granger (left). British acting veterans, including Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and Emma Thompson, portray various Hogwarts professors or stalwarts. "If childhood is being surrounded by people who you love being around and being incredibly happy, then I absolutely have had that," he tells the Hartford Courant. 
2001November 16The First Potter ExperienceHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone hits theaters, eventually earning $976 million worldwide. The New York Times likens it to "a covers act by an extremely competent tribute band." By September 2007, according to Warner Brothers, the first five films tally a worldwide box office total of more than $4.47 billion. Becoming Harry, Radcliffe tells Vanity Fair in 2001, "was probably the single most exciting thing that's ever happened to me." Pottermania: Under His SpellRadcliffe has some seriously crazed fans. One tried leaping into his car from her car window while stopped at a traffic light in New York. Another time, when he was 12, Radcliffe "was walking down the street next to this girl in France, and she started screaming," he recalls to Rolling Stone. "And I was really frightened, so I started screaming." 2007February 27Parting from Potter – in the Buff!Radcliffe appears nude on the London stage in Equus. The 17-year-old, who plays a troubled stable boy (left), tells Details, "It's the least arousing process...when you get naked in front of 900 people, quite the opposite happens." As Radcliffe grows up, so does Harry, who shares his first kiss with fellow Hogwarts student Cho Chang (played by Katie Leung) in the fifth Potter film. In 2008, he takes his nude Equus role to Broadway. June 23Richest TeenThe British press estimates 18-year-old Radcliffe's total net worth at $35 million or more, as he appears front and center on PEOPLE's Richest Teens cover. Radcliffe credits his parents with keeping his ego out of the sky: "I might be arrogant and big-headed, but they kept me really grounded, and I can't thank them enough for that," he says. AugustHarry's Growing UpSwapping Harry's school robes for leather, Radcliffe sports a hip makeover on the cover of Details. In September, he's on the big screen again, starring in December Boys, where he has a seduction scene with costar Teresa Palmer. "It's a sex scene that's not sexy. It's clumsy and sweet," Radcliffe tells The Guardian. 2009July'Welcome Back, Potter'Two years since the last Potter film, Radcliffe and costars Watson and Grint reunite on the cover of EW. The sixth installment of the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, marks the end of the young wizards' days at Hogwarts. In its first week at the box office, the film rakes in a worldwide total of $396.7 million.2010November 19The Beginning of the EndAs the first in the final two installments of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows hits theaters, Radcliffe tells MTV he's sad to see the saga come to an end – but proud of the story's epic climax. "To sustain this level of quality for 10 years is a very rare thing in a big franchise," he says. "I think we've done amazingly. I'm thrilled." The film rakes in $125.1 million over opening weekend, setting a franchise record.

This article covers a subject that is part of the real world, and thus should not be taken as a part of the Harry Potter universe.
This article is about the actor who plays Harry Potter. You may be looking for the in-universe actor.
Daniel Jacob Radcliffe (born 23 July, 1989), from Fulham, London, is a British actor who is best known for playing Harry Potter, the main character of the film adaptations of the Harry Potter series.
Radcliffe was born on 23 July 1989 in West London, England, the only child of Alan George Radcliffe, a literary agent, and Marcia Jeannine Gresham (née Marcia Gresham Jacobson), a casting agent who was involved in several films for the BBC, including The Inspector Lynley Mysteries and Walk Away And I Stumble.[Alan Radcliffe and Marcia Gresham, discouraged their only child from show business when, at age five, he said that he wanted to perform.   
However, they must have soon changed their minds, as in December 1999, he made his first on-screen appearance as the young David Copperfield in    Daniel Radcliffe as a young David Copperfield.  David Copperfield, the BBC's televised version of the Dickens novel David Copperfield. This was followed in 2001 by his first film appearance, as Mark Pendel in The Tailor of Panama. In 2001 he starred in his most remembered role; that of Harry Potter in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.In 2002 he had a role in the play The Play What I Wrote directed by Kenneth Branagh; a production well known for their "suprise guest".
In 2004 and 2005 he returned to the Potter franchise in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. He reprised the role of Harry in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, scheduled for a November 2005 release. Radcliffe starred in the independent Australian film December Boys directed by Rod Hardy within the next year and in 2007 he once again put on the famous lightning-bolt shaped scar and round glasses in the fifth Harry Potter film Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. In 2009, he was in its sequel, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. He appeared in the final two Harry Potter movies, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 in 2010 and 2011, respectively. In 2012 he portrayed Arthur Kipps in the horror film The Woman in Black alongside his Harry Potter co-star Ciarán Hinds. His on-screen son is played by his real-life godson.[1]
Radcliffe was educated at the famed private all-boys school Sussex House. He also attended the Anna Scher Theatre School in London. He has two dogs named Binka and Nugget.
Daniel prefers being called Dan. He plays the bass guitar and once had a bass lesson from Prisoner of Azkaban co-star Gary Oldman. A passionate guitar rock music fan, some of his favourite bands include The Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Libertines, The Strokes, and The Red Hot Chili Peppers. His personal favourite band is The Hold Steady, Out of Brooklyn.[citation needed]   Daniel Radcliffe  
Radcliffe has also been a supporter of various charities. Fans have, on his request, repeatedly donated to various organisations, including the Demelza House charity.
In 2006, Radcliffe spoofed his Harry Potter image in an episode of the comedy series Extras starring Ricky Gervais. In the episode, Radcliffe plays himself, but a warped version who womanizes and keeps coming on to Dame Diana Rigg, also appearing as herself. In the film, Radcliffe appears in several scenes spoofing Harry Potter, only with Radcliffe playing a Boy Scout (with Potter glasses) who comes upon an elf in the forest (played by his Potter co-star Warwick Davis). The DVD release of the episode included outtakes in which Radcliffe couldn't keep a straight face whenever Davis uttered a line of dialogue about his flute.
In 2007, Radcliffe starred, along with his Harry Potter co-star Richard Griffiths, in the London West End stage production, Equus. Leading up to his performance, the 17 year old star received much criticism about the adult content in the production. Radcliffe appears nude in the production and publicity materials portrayed a much grown-up and nude Radcliffe. Radcliffe also smokes in the play, upsetting some Harry Potter fans and anti-smoking advocates.[citation needed] He reprised his role in the US production in September 2008. It ended on February 8, 2009.
In August 2008 Dan revealed that he has dyspraxia, which is a developmental issue that make it hard for him to do certain things.
In an interview in Entertainment Weekly, he has said that he cannot wait to film the seventh Harry Potter movie. After rereading the chapter in which Harry encounters Dumbledore in King's Cross, he was surprised to find out Harry is completely naked during the scene, to which he replied, "It's old hat for me now," referring to his role in Equus, in which he is naked on stage for a period of time. However that scene was changed for Part 2, so that Harry and Dumbledore have the conversation from the book, but Harry isn't naked.
Dan    Dan in 2008.  has also revealed that he is Jewish, on his mother's side, and "is very proud to be Jewish". However, he also claims that he is an atheist.[2]
In 2009, Radcliffe was nominated and voted in eighteenth place in Portrait Magazine, Top 30 Under 30 2009 List.[3] Some of Dan's fellow Harry Potter costars were also nominated. Bonnie Wright who plays Ginny Weasley was second place, Evanna Lynch who plays Luna Lovegood was third place, Rupert Grint who plays Ron Weasley was fifth place, Emma Watson who plays Hermione Granger was eighth place, and Tom Felton who plays Draco Malfoy was fourteenth place.
When Equus first hit the stage many parents were concerned due to Radcliffe smoking in the production, and the effect this behaviour may have on their children. Radcliffe assured his fans that the cigarettes he smokes in the play are fake, and that he does not smoke in real life. However, Radcliffe was photographed with a cigarette in hand, and has since confessed that he does indeed smoke. Speculation continues as to what the cigarette actually contained; as the picture was snapped at a celebrity party - in London - it was unlikely to consist solely of tobacco.[citation needed]   Radcliffe in July 2009.  
In March 2011 Radcliffe enraged executives of Warner Bros. when he decided to appear in a showing of his play How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying on the same night as the London premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. Warner Bros. was forced to pay the play's production company $300,000 to cancel the performance and ensure Radcliffe's attendance at the premiere.[4]
     00:43     Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 (2011) - Interview "Daniel Radcliffe On The Last 10 Years With Harry Potter" Daniel Radcliffe discusses ten years of Harry Potter  
Before the Harry Potter films, Daniel starred in David Copperfield as young David Copperfield with Maggie Smith as Betsey Trotwood. It was, after seeing this movie that Chris Columbus discovered the young boy and knew that he would be the perfect Harry.
Daniel's on-screen first kiss was not Harry's kiss with Cho Chang, played by Katie Leung in Order of the Phoenix, but was with Teresa Palmer in the Australian film December Boys, which had been filmed earlier.
Daniel briefly played Lord Voldemort when Voldemort possessed Harry during Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
In the "Seven Potters" scene of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, Daniel also plays Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger, Fred Weasley, George Weasley, Fleur Delacour and Mundungus Fletcher. According to Daniel, the scene took 96 takes to shoot.
Daniel's character, Harry, has green eyes when in fact Dan has blue eyes. This is due to the fact that Dan cannot stand wearing contact lenses. Ironically, Rupert Grint has green eyes while his character, Ron, has blue eyes.
Daniel's character in the 2011 film The Woman in Black was played by Adrian Rawlins in the 1989 film The Woman in Black. Rawlins plays his father in the Harry Potter films.
He starred alongside Ciaran Hinds in The Woman in Black, who portrayed Aberforth Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.
During the days when they were shooting the early films, both Daniel and Rupert had a crush on Emma Watson, their co-star who plays Hermione Granger, and both tried to win her affection. It is unknown whether any of them still harbours the affection today.
Dan knows all of the elements in the periodic table and has the ability to sing Tom Lehrer's song, "The Elements".[5]

=======================================================
                After mesmerising millions of fans with his on-screen portrayal of the boy wizard Harry Potter, in February 2007 British actor Daniel Radcliffe worked his magic onstage with his performance in the London West End theatrical production of Peter Shaffer's 'Equus'.  In the challenging role of psychotically deranged teenager Alan Strang, whose unnatural love of horses drove him to blind six of them with a hoof pick, Radcliffe demonstrated the breadth of his acting skills, as well as his level of maturity as an actor. He also succeeded in literally shedding his childlike image when he was required to appear nude onstage during one scene. Radcliffe began acting at the age of six when he appeared as a monkey in a school play. After passing up an opportunity to audition for a television production of Charles Dickens's 'Oliver Twist', he caught the attention of TV producer Kate Harwood, who was impressed by his “charm and simplicity”, and he was cast in the title role of 'David Copperfield' (1999). Two years later, Radcliffe appeared in the film 'The Tailor of Panama' (2001). His big break came when he was cast to star in the film 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' (2001). His parents initially refused to let him audition for the role, but a chance meeting with Sorcerer's Stone director Chris Columbus and producer David Heyman at the theatre one evening led to an eventual audition. Those involved with the film, including Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling, were in overwhelming agreement that Radcliffe would make the perfect Harry, and the books' legions of fans seemed to agree. He reprised his role in 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' (2002), 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' (2004), and 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' (2005), in which he performed some of his own stunts. In addition to 'Equus', Radcliffe juggled numerous other on-screen projects, including 2007: 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix', the British TV movie 'My Boy Jack', and the Australian coming-of-age film 'December Boys'. Radcliffe also signed on to complete the last two films in the series, 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince', which went into production in 2007 released in late 2008, and 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'.  Part 1 of the final films in the Harry Potter series was released in 2010, while the second instalment is due to hit cinema screens on 15 July 2011, and will feature the decisive battle between the central character played by Radcliffe, and Ralph Fiennes' Lord Voldermort. In an interview for US TV show 'The View', Radcliffe admitted that he was brought to tears filming the final scenes for the Harry Potter series. He said: "It was very emotional, I wept like a child." He also explained that he finds it more relaxing to appear on stage, rather than screen, as "with film there is more time for self-doubt to creep in", whereas he implied that stage is more immediate. 2011 will also see Radcliffe star in a film version of Susan Hill's 'The Woman in Black', a role which the 21-year-old said he was "incredibly excited" to be part of. The script was written by Jonathan's Ross' wife, Jane Goldman, perhaps best known for writing the script for the super hero action film, 'Kick Ass'. Radcliffe praised Goldman's 'The Woman in Black' script, describing it as "beautifully written - both tender and terrifying in equal measure".

=======================================================
Acting was almost inevitable for English-born Radcliffe, with a casting director mother and a father who works as a literary agent. Although he failed to get the lead role in the telefilm Oliver Twist he soon landed the part of young David Copperfield in the telefilm, David Copperfield.
Working with such seasoned actors as Bob Hoskins, Maggie Smith and Sir Ian McKellen, he received a top quality atmosphere for learning the ropes. Two years later, he made his feature film debut in The Tailor Of Panama (2001). It was while he was filming that role that Chris Columbus, the director of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, asked him to come and audition, having seen him in David Copperfield. However, Radcliffe's parents thought that the project was too bigthat their son's life would change too much by landing such a large role. Ironically, he was at a theater one night with his father, watching a play, when he was approached by the producer, David Heyman, during the intermission. He later called the Radcliffes to ask if Daniel could meet, regarding the role in Harry Potter. After the meeting, he was asked to audition, and by this time, Radcliffe had convinced his parents to let him try out for the role.
Chris Columbus was thrilled that Radcliffe was showing interest, as he'd decided early on that the young actor was perfect to play the role of Harry. Although he'd auditioned other young actors, no one had been able to make him forget Radcliffe's haunting quality as young David Copperfield. Radcliffe found himself playing the lead role of Harry Potter in the anticipated family film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, based on J.K. Rowling's popular novel, and signed on to star in the first five movies.
Once his contract was up, he signed another contract for $50 million to star in the final two films of the series. After wrapping up production of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007), he received critical acclaim for his starring role in the stage play Equus, which garnered him worldwide attention due to a nude scene. He then repeated his performance on Broadway.
Radcliffe graduated from an all-boys' private school and spent most of 2011 on Broadway, starring in the musical revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. In 2012, The Woman in Black marked his first starring film role since the Harry Potter series ended in 2011 with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. 
On the personal front, Daniel has been dating Rosie Coker for two years and is thinking of marrying in the near future.

=======================================================
The boy who won one of the most coveted roles in film history, young Daniel Radcliffe beat out legions of aspiring bespectacled mini-wizards to fill the shoes of author J.K. Rowling's junior sorcerer Harry Potter in the much-anticipated film adaptation of Rowling's wildly popular book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001). 
Born July 23, 1989, in England, Radcliffe began to realize his love for acting at the age of five. Although his parents voiced objections, youthful enthusiasm soon won out and Radcliffe was on his way to stardom. Convincing his mother to send a picture to the BBC for consideration in an upcoming adaptation of David Copperfield, the precocious youth was quickly cast in the role of the young Copperfield, shortly thereafter turning up alongside Pierce Brosnan in John Boorman's The Tailor of Panama. It was his next role in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001), however, that would launch the young actor directly into the heart of the public eye. Based on the first book in J.K. Rowling's enormously popular fantasy series that followed the adventures of young Potter as he attends Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the film faithfully captured the essence of the book in bringing the otherworldly exploits of the magical youngster to the screen. Radcliffe turned out one Harry Potter film after another; all were blockbusters, and all well received by the public and press. By the time the final film in the series was released to theaters -- 2011's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 -- Radcliffe had graduated to the ranks of adult actors, and was appearing in the gostly thriller The Woman in Black the next year.
During his breaks from playing Harry, Radcliffe starred in the stage revival of Peter Shaffer's Equus, and had a lead performance in Rod Hardy's gentle 2006 coming-of-ager December Boys (set in rural Australia during the '60s). 
Radcliffe took on the starring role of barrister Arthur Kipps, a widower who discovers a supernatural presence after taking a job as caretaker to a crumbling estate in 2012's gothic horror The Woman in Black. Fresh off the 2011 conclusion of the Harry Potter films, many critics praised Radcliffe for readily handling the drastically different tone of The Woman in Black.
