Visionary, eclectic, and iconic, Karl Lagerfeld would most certainly have been an enlightened mind in the Age of Enlightenment. As a fashion designer, photographer, publisher, designer, and also film director, Karl Lagerfeld has created a universe in which every line is perfectly under control, each detail of absolute importance. The Cartesian mind has hatched a caustic, ultramodern, highly structured style, with an allure and a manner that emerges through graphic symbols that have become his unequivocal hallmarks.
Karl Lagerfeld instinctively grasps every molecule from the atmosphere and turns it into the mood of the moment. His style delves deep into his cosmopolitan background and into his perfect mastery of languages, which he acquired in Hamburg, where he was born in 1938. As soon as he had finished his studies in Paris, he entered the world of fashion still a very young man, and in 1954 he won the Woolmark Prize. The coat he created for the occasion, which won over the jury, was made by Pierre Balmain, who recognized the young graduate’s talent and took him on as his new assistant. Three years later, Karl Lagerfeld was appointed artistic director of the Maison Jean Patou. Karl Lagerfeld is intriguing and ever-questioning, never leaving anyone indifferent. His ability to capture, anticipate, and interpret tomorrow’s trends always fascinates. Just when ready-to-wear fashions were first taking shape, he embarked on a career as a freelance fashion designer in France, Italy, Britain, and Germany. In Paris he left his marks on Chloé. In Rome he worked to give a new look to Fendi furs. His joint venture with the Italian fashion house started in 1965 and, over the years, extended to all the label’s ready-to-wear collections, and it is still going today. A chameleon of style, Karl Lagerfeld has nevertheless refined stylistic features of his own, which he works into his own eponymous line, which has been going since 1984. One year earlier, he had been called in to give new life to Chanel: he gradually shook up its stylistic elements, rejuvenated its image, and introduced a breath of fresh air that allowed the brand to reassert its supremacy in the world of luxury and fashion.
An insatiable couturier and designer, he again put his name to the Chloé collections from 1992 to 1997, and opened up a new chapter in his own name, launching the Lagerfeld Gallery in 1998 (the maison again adopted the name of its founder in 2006: Karl Lagerfeld). Always in tune with the world around him, he was the first to agree to take on the mass market, designing thirty models for H&M. This experience led to a new idea – a “new beginning”- which he started working on in 2010, announcing a collection for 2011 based on a new concept: mass-market ready-to-wear garments steeped in the luxury and quality of which the Lagerfeld’s style is a symbol: “mass elitism, which has long been my dream (…), it’s the future of modernity.”
“What I really like is what I’ve never done before”, says Karl Lagerfeld. Since he can never be content with the countless successes he has achieved in his fashion career, he has opened out his range of expression; creating opera costumes, revamping the Coca Cola Light bottle, and giving a new look to Medicom Toy’s Bearbrick and Steiff plush toys. In 1999 came the opening of his 7L bookshop and, the following year, his Editions 7L publishing company.
In 1975 he wrote a new page of artistic expression with the Chloé perfume. His catalogue of olfactory sensations was later enhanced with Lagerfeld pour Homme (1978), Jako (1998), and Kapsule (2008), as well as Photo, in 1991, an insolent citrusy fragrance that appears to gesture towards Lagerfeld, who by then had been behind the lens for some years.
“Long before I decided to turn to photography myself, I had always been struck by the idea of expressing my vision of things through anonymous ‘machine’, as though it were a paintbrush or a pencil.”
Ever since then, Karl Lagerfeld has himself shot all the advertising campaigns for the brands he has worked for as a designer. Under his direction, Claudia Schiffer, Vanessa Paradis, Diane Kruger, and Lilly Allen, as well as les tops Freja Beha Erichsen, Coco Rocha, Elisa Sedanoui and Babtiste Giabiconi have revealed a different face and played new roles. His great passion for photography has led to several works being published by Steidl (including The Beauty of Violence in 2010) as well as of series for the great fashion magazines (Numéro, Vogue, …), information magazines (Vanity Fair, Stern,…) and specialized publications (Connaissance des Arts, Interview, …).
“Today, photography is part of my life. I can’t see life without the vision of photography. I look at the world and at fashion with the eye of a camera. This enables me to maintain a critical detachment in my everyday work, which helps me more than I could ever have imagined.”
As well as for his sense of style and allure, Karl Lagerfeld is also in great demand for his sense of image and for the visual identity that so forcefully emerges from his printed works on paper. Whether he is photographing for advertising or fashion magazines, for an exhibition at Art Basel, at the Maiosn Européenne de la Photographie, at the palace of Versailles, in Tokyo or New York, or even in Berlin, his style is always instantly recognizable. “A highly personal vision of reality”, as Anne Cartier-Bresson puts it.
“Of all materials in the world, the one I like best is papers. It’s the starting point for a drawing and the finishing point for a photograph.”
With this taste for photography and this sense of stage direction, Karl Lagerfeld could not fail to be turned to as a director for the silver screen. The results of this new form of applied art – his short movies Remember Now, Vol de Jour, Shopping Fever and his latest, La Lettre – all reveal a certain idea of Lagerfeld’s aesthetic vision. A new facet of the fashion designer, and certainly a prelude to future projects…

Karl Lagerfeld (born Karl Otto Lagerfeldt, 10 September 1933) is a German fashion designer, artist, and photographer based in Paris. He is the head designer and creative director of the fashion house Chanel as well as the Italian house Fendi and his own label fashion house. Over the decades, he has collaborated on a variety of fashion and art-related projects. He is well recognized around the world for his trademark white hair, black glasses, and high starched collars.[5]
Lagerfeld was born in Hamburg. He has claimed he was born in 1938 to Elisabeth (1897-1978, née Bahlman) and Otto Ludwig Lagerfeldt.[6] He is known to insist that no one knows his real birth date; interviewed on French television in February 2009, Lagerfeld said that he was "born neither in 1933 nor 1938."[7] In April 2013 he finally declared that he was born in 1935.[8] A birth announcement was, however, published by his parents in 1933, and the baptismal register in Hamburg also lists him as born in 1933.[9] His older sister, Martha Christiane (a.k.a. Christel), was born in 1931. Lagerfeld has an older half-sister, Thea, from his father's first marriage. His original name was Lagerfeldt (with a "t"), but he later changed it to Lagerfeld as, in his words, "it sounds more commercial."[10]
Purportedly, Lagerfeld grew up as the son of a wealthy businessman in Carnation Company, who was introducing powdered milk. His family was mainly shielded from the deprivations of World War II due to his father's business interests in Germany through the firm Glücksklee-Milch GmbH.[11][12] His mother is from Berlin;[13] according to Alicia Drake,[vague] she was a lingerie saleswoman there when she met her husband and married him in 1930.
After attending a private school, Lagerfeld finished his secondary school at the Lycée Montaigne in Paris, where he majored in drawing and history.[14]
Lagerfeld was hired as Pierre Balmain's assistant after winning the coats category in a design competition sponsored by the International Wool Secretariat in 1955. In 1958, after three years at Balmain, he moved to Jean Patou where he designed two haute couture collections a year for five years. His first collection was shown in a two-hour presentation in July 1958, but he used the name Roland Karl, rather than Karl Lagerfeld. Although, in 1962, reporters began referring to him as Karl Lagerfelt or Karl Logerfeld. The first collection was poorly received. Carrie Donovan, an American fashion journalist, wrote that "the press booed the collection"[citation needed]. The UPI noted: "The firm's brand new designer, 25-year old Roland Karl, showed a collection which stressed shape and had no trace of last year's sack." The reporter went on to say: "A couple of short black cocktail dresses were cut so wide open at the front that even some of the women reporters gasped. Other cocktail and evening dresses feature low, low-cut backs." Most interestingly, Karl said that his design silhouette for the season was called by the letter "K" for Karl, which was translated into a straight line in front, curved in at the waist in the back, with a low fullness to the skirt.
His skirts for the spring 1960 season were the shortest in Brisbane, and the collection was not well received. Carrie Donovan wrote that it "looked like clever and immensely salable ready-to-wear, not couture." For his late 1960 collection, he designed special little hats, pancake shaped circles of satin, which hung on the cheek. He called them "slaps in the face." Karl's collection was said to be well received but not groundbreaking. "I became bored there, too, and I quit and tried to go back to school, but that didn't work, so I spent two years mostly on beaches—I guess I studied life."' In 1963, he began designing for Tiziani, a Roman couture house founded that year by Evan Richards (b. 1924) of Jacksboro, Texas. It began as couture and then branched out into ready-to-wear, bearing the label "Tiziani-Roma—Made in England." Lagerfeld and Richards sketched the first collection in 1963 together. "When they wound up with 90 outfits, Tiziani threw caution and invitations to the winds, borrowed Catherine the Great's jewels from Harry Winston, and opened his salon with a three-night wingding," according to one report in 1969. Lagerfeld designed for the company until 1969. Elizabeth Taylor was a fan of the label; she referred to Evan as Evan Tiziani, which was, of course, not his family name, and began wearing the outfits in August 1966. Gina Lollobrigida, Doris Duke, and Princess Marcella Borghese were also customers while Lagerfeld was designing the line. He was replaced in 1969 with Guy Douvier (1928–1993).
Lagerfeld began to freelance for French fashion house Chloé in 1964, at first designing a few pieces each season. As more and more pieces were incorporated, he soon designed the entire collection. In 1970, he also began a brief design collaboration with Roman haute-couture house Curiel; its head was Gigliola Curiel, who died in November 1969. Lagerfeld's first collection there was described as having a "drippy drapey elegance" designed for a "1930s cinema queen."[according to whom?] The Curiel mannequins all wore identical, short-cropped blonde wigs. He also showed black velvet shorts, worn under a black velvet ankle-length cape.
His Chloé collection for spring 1973 (shown in October 1972) garnered headlines for offering something both "high fashion and high camp." He showed loose Spencer jackets and printed silk shirt-jackets. He designed something he called a "surprise" skirt, which was in an ankle-length, pleated silk, so loose that it hid the fact it was actually pants. "It seems that wearing these skirts is an extraordinary sensation," he told a reporter at the time. He also designed a look inspired by Carmen Miranda, which consisted of mini-bra dresses with very short skirts, and long dresses with bra tops and scarf shawls.
From 1972, he collaborated with Italian fashion house Fendi, designing furs, clothing, and accessories.
Starting in the 1970s, Lagerfeld has occasionally worked as a costume designer for theatrical productions. He collaborated with stage directors such as Luca Ronconi and Jürgen Flimm, and designed for theaters such as La Scala in Milan (Les Troyens by Hector Berlioz, 1980; directed by Ronconi), the Burgtheater in Vienna (Komödie der Verführung by Arthur Schnitzler, 1980; directed by Horst Zankl), and the Salzburg Festival (Der Schwierige by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, 1990; directed by Flimm).
At the time, he was maintaining a design contract with Japanese firm Isetan to create collections for both men and women through 30 licenses, had a lingerie line in the U.S. produced by Eve Stillmann, was designing shoes for Charles Jourdan and sweaters for Ballantyne, and worked with Trevira as a fashion adviser.
In 2002, Karl Lagerfeld asked Renzo Rosso, the founder of Diesel, to collaborate with him on a special denim collection for the Lagerfeld Gallery.[15] The collection, Lagerfeld Gallery by Diesel, was co-designed by Lagerfeld and then developed by Diesel's creative team, under the supervision of Rosso. It consisted of five pieces that were presented during the designer's catwalk shows during Paris Fashion Week[16] and then sold in highly limited editions at the Lagerfeld Galleries in Paris and Monaco and at the Diesel Denim Galleries in New York and Tokyo. During the first week of sales in New York, more than 90% of the trousers were sold out, even though prices ranged from $240 to $1,840.[17] In a statement after the show in Paris, Rosso said: "I am honored to have met this fashion icon of our time. Karl represents creativity, tradition and challenge, and the fact that he thought of Diesel for this collaboration is a great gift and acknowledgement of our reputation as the prêt-à-porter of casual wear."[16]
Lagerfeld designed the costumes for the Carmen sequences in the 2002 film Callas Forever; in 2004, some outfits for singer Madonna for her Re-Invention tour, and recently outfits for Kylie Minogue's Showgirl tour.[citation needed]
Lagerfeld collaborated with H&M, which, on 12 November 2004, offered a limited range of Lagerfeld clothes for men and women, in certain outlets. Only two days after having supplied its outlets, H&M announced that almost all the clothes were sold out. However, Lagerfeld has expressed some fear that working with lower-end brands will taint his image;[citation needed] although, in the past he has worked closely with the hosiery designer Wolford.
Lagerfeld is also a photographer. He produced Visionaire 23: The Emperor's New Clothes, a series of nude pictures of models and celebrities. He also personally photographed Mariah Carey for the cover of V magazine in 2005. In addition to his editorial work for Harper's Bazaar, Numéro, and Russian and German editions of Vogue, Lagerfeld photographs advertising campaigns for the houses under his direction—Chanel, Fendi, and his eponymous line.
In the 1980s, Hans Christian Andersen tale "The Emperor's New Clothes" was published with drawings by Lagerfeld.
The designer was also the subject of French reality-TV series "Signé Chanel" in 2005. It covered the creation of his fall/winter 2004–2005 Chanel couture collection and aired on Sundance Channel in the United States during the fall of 2006.
He has also supported and encouraged the work of up-and-coming designers including Philip Colbert of Rodnik.[citation needed]
On 18 December 2006, Lagerfeld announced the launch of a new collection for men and women dubbed K Karl Lagerfeld, which included fitted T-shirts and a wide range of jeans.[18]
Lagerfeld has signed a deal with Dubai Infinity Holdings (DIH); an investments enterprise that focuses on first-of-its-kind projects in non-conventional growth sectors, in line with its mandate[vague] to fulfil unmet market needs. Lagerfeld is to design limited edition homes[vague] on Isla Moda, the world’s first dedicated fashion island,[vague][vague]The World. This is a collaboration between Dubai Infinity Holdings and Lagerfeld across the Cooperative Council of Arab States and India.[citation needed]
Lagerfeld is the host of fictional radio station K109—The Studio in videogame Grand Theft Auto IV.[19]
In 2008, he created a teddy bear in his likeness produced by Steiff in an edition of 2,500 that sold for $1,500.[20] and has been immortalized in many forms, which include pins, shirts, dolls, and more. In 2009, Tra Tutti began selling Karl Lagermouse and Karl Lagerfelt, which are mini-Lagerfelds in the forms of mice and finger puppets, respectively.[21]
On 10 September 2010, the Couture Council of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology presented Lagerfeld with an award created for him, The Couture Council Fashion Visionary Award, at a benefit luncheon at Avery Fisher Hall, New York.[22]
On 10 November 2010, Lagerfeld and Swedish crystal manufacturer Orrefors announced a collaboration to design a crystal art collection.[23] The first collection was launched in spring 2011, called Orrefors by Karl Lagerfeld.[24]
Lagerfeld's apartment in Paris was published in the French issue of Architectural Digest in May 2012.[25] He also revealed his vast collection of Suzanne Belperron's pins and brooches and used the color of one of her blue chalcedony rings as the starting point for the Chanel spring/summer 2012 collection.[26]
In 2013, he directed the short film Once Upon a Time... in the Cité du Cinéma, Saint-Denis, by Luc Besson, featuring Keira Knightley in the role of Coco Chanel and Clotilde Hesme as her aunt Adrienne Chanel.[citation needed]
In 2014, an auction house in Florida announced that many of Lagerfeld's early sketches for the House of Tiziani in Rome would be sold.[27][28]
In 1993, he caused U.S. Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour to walk out of his Milan Fashion Week runway show, when he employed strippers and adult-film star Moana Pozzi to model his black-and-white collection for Fendi.[29]
There was much controversy from Lagerfeld's use of a verse from the Qur'an in his spring 1994 couture collection for Chanel, despite apologies from the designer and the fashion house. The controversy erupted after the 1994 couture show in Paris, when the Indonesian Muslim Scholars Council in Jakarta called for a boycott of Chanel and threatened to file formal protests with the government of Mr. Lagerfeld's homeland, Germany. The designer apologized, explaining that he had taken the design from a book about the Taj Mahal, thinking the words came from a love poem.[30]
Lagerfeld was the target of a pieing by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in 2001 at a fashion premiere at Lincoln Center in New York City. The tofu pies hurled by animal rights activists in protest of his use of fur within his collections, however went astray and hit Calvin Klein. A PETA spokesperson described the hit on Klein as "friendly fire," calling Klein, who doesn't use fur, "a great friend to the animals" and Lagerfeld a "designer dinosaur," who continues to use fur in his collections.[31]
Lagerfeld is attempting to defend the fur industry and the use of fur in fashion. He himself doesn't wear fur and hardly eats meat. In a BBC interview in 2009, he claimed that hunters "make a living having learnt nothing else than hunting, killing those beasts who would kill us if they could" and maintained: "In a meat-eating world, wearing leather for shoes and clothes and even handbags, the discussion of fur is childish." Spokespersons for PETA called Lagerfeld "a fashion dinosaur who is as out of step as his furs are out of style."[32] and "particularly delusional with his kill-or-be-killed mentality. When was the last time a person's life was threatened by a mink or rabbit?"[33]
In 2010, PETA cites Lagerfeld, who used fake fur in his 2010 Chanel collection, on its website as saying: "It's the triumph of fake fur… because fake fur changed so much and became so great now that you can hardly see a difference."[34]
Lagerfeld in 2009 joined critics of supermodel Heidi Klum. After German designer Wolfgang Joop called Klum, who had posed naked on the cover of the German edition of GQ magazine, as being[35] "no runway model. She is simply too heavy and has too big a bust."[36] Lagerfeld retorted that neither he nor Claudia Schiffer knew Klum as she has never worked in Paris and is insignificant in the world of high fashion, being "more bling bling and glamorous than current fashion."[37]
Lagerfeld created an international furore on 9 February 2012, when he called the singer Adele "a little too fat."[38] This caused instant fury throughout the United Kingdom, and Lagerfeld responded with a statement of apology. Adele hit back by saying she is like the majority of women, and she is very proud of that fact.[39][40] Lagerfeld later caused another controversy, on 31 July 2012, when he criticized Pippa Middleton, sister of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, for her looks. The comment was made when Lagerfeld was praising Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, for her "romantic beauty" before adding: "I don't like the sister's face. She should only show her back."[41][42][43]
When Lagerfeld lost 42 kg (about 92.6 lbs.) in 13 months in 2001, he explained: "I suddenly wanted to dress differently, to wear clothes designed by Hedi Slimane.... But these fashions, modeled by very, very slim boys—and not men my age—required me to lose at least 40 kg. It took me exactly 13 months." The diet was created specially for Lagerfeld by Dr. Jean-Claude Houdret, which led to a book called The Karl Lagerfeld Diet, which he promoted on Larry King Live and other TV shows.[10]
Lagerfeld had a long term relationship from early 1970s with socialite Jacques de Bascher (1951-1989) until his death in 1989.[44]
Lagerfeld has owned numerous homes: in 1970s apartment in Rue de l'Universite in Paris decorated in Art Deco style, 1970s-2000 18th-century chateau de Penhoët in Bretagne decorated in Rococo style, from early 1980s apartment in Monte Carlo decorated until 2000 in 1980s Memphis style, from middle of 1990s until 2000 villa Jako in Blankensee in Hamburg decorated in Art Deco style, from 1990s until 2000 villa La Vigie in Monaco, between 1980s-2000s he rented the 17th-century mansion (hôtel particulier) in Rue de l'Universite in Paris decorated in Rococo and other styles, 2006-2012 apartment in Manhattan in New York (never moved in or decorated), 1990s-2006 summer villa El Horria in Biarritz decorated in modern style and from 2000s a 1840s house in Vermont in the US. From 2007 Lagerfeld has owned a 1820s house in Paris in Quai Voltaire decorated in modern and Art Deco style.[44]
Lagerfeld owns a red point Birman cat named Choupette, which, on 1 June 2013, he indicated he would marry, were it legal.[45]

'Kaiser Karl' lent his sartorial savvy to Valentino, Fendi and Chloe before settling at Chanel. Born in Hamburg, he moved to Paris in 1952 and made fashion history.
Karl Lagerfeld moved to Paris at the age of 14 and, by 17, thanks to a coat design competition, had won a job with Pierre Balmain.
A stint working for Jean Patou, in 1958, provided the young Karl with valuable couture experience and, within a year, he was successfully working for a number of top Paris fashion houses. However, having become disillusioned with Paris fashion, he moved to Italy to further his fashion education.
He joined Fendi and, during the 1970s, he worked with Chloe. His 1972 Deco collection attracted worldwide acclaim and, by 1983, he had moved to Chanel.
Lagerfeld went on to launch his own label, offering what he termed “intellectual sexiness", with bright colours and softly shaped knitwear.
While still working for Chanel, his achievements were many, including the box jacket with denim mini skirts, in 1991, and black fishnet body-stockings with Chanel branding over the breasts. Lagerfeld’s strong sense of humour has led to such pieces as the shower-dress, the car-dress and a range of whacky hats!
Outside of his fashion world, Karl enjoys learning languages and speaks fluent German, English, French and Italian. His other passions include antiques and photography, and he consider himself a workaholic – totally in love with his job!
=======================================================
Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. Published in Vogue, December 2003.In the deep, all-knowing German voice that could belong to no other, Karl Lagerfeld declared in 1984, “I would like to be a one-man multinational fashion phenomenon.”[1] In this—as in so many things—he was, if perhaps not self-effacing, extremely prescient. Today, the influence of his designs is rivaled only by the infamy of his ever-present dark sunglasses (“They’re my burka,”[2] he has professed), his magnetic pull towards controversy, and his tendency to say things like, “Vanity is the healthiest thing in life.”[3]
Lagerfeld has become far more than just a fashion phenomenon. With runway conquests at the houses of Chloé, Fendi, and Chanel, and as a remarkable barometer of the twenty-first-century zeitgeist, he is an industry unto himself. In a business that tosses the word “icon” about with reckless abandon, he is genuinely iconic, wielding his trademark fan and his repertoire of witticisms—sometimes provocative, often amusing, and always Karl. Old enough to be the grandfather of some of his Parisian competitors, he is a modern Oscar Wilde, a black-leather dandy with a rock ’n’ roll pout.
The success of Karl Lagerfeld—who can reportedly turn out 200 original lightning-speed sketches in a twelve-hour stretch—is founded on a high level of technical skill, honed from an early age. After moving to Paris as a young man, he competed in a design contest sponsored by the International Wool Secretariat. His winning garment, a wool coat, led him to an apprenticeship with Pierre Balmain. (The dress category in the same competition was won by Yves Saint Laurent.) Despite his victory, Lagerfeld admitted that he didn’t much like designing coats; what he really loved doing, he told a reporter, was little black dresses. He went on, of course, to become the crown-bearer of the timeless empire whose founder was herself the progenitor of said little black dress: Chanel.
Fifty-seven years after Vogue first showed readers Coco Chanel’s innovative LBD in 1926, the company was placed in Lagerfeld’s studded-fingerless-gloved hands, and neither the LBD nor Chanel were ever the same. “My job,” Lagerfeld has said, “is to bring out in people what they wouldn’t dare do themselves.”[4] In a way, this is what he did for the Chanel image, as well: Its elegance and dignity had lost their clout among the sixties generation of jeans-and-miniskirts-wearers, but Lagerfeld was able to transform the house into the ultimate purveyor of bad-girl chic (wealthy bad girl, that is). He was, it turned out, the perfect designer to bring the nodding camellias back to life. “Tradition is something you have to handle carefully, because it can kill you,” he told Vogue in 1984. “Respect was never creative.”[5]
In his first years as creative director, Lagerfeld was accused by some critics of going too far—so far as to desecrate their hallowed memories of Chanel. He threw so much leather and chains into his early collections that his old friend Yves Saint Laurent balked: Chanel, he said, had become “frightening, sadomasochistic.”[6] “Who can say what is good taste and what is bad taste?” the designer has countered. “Sometimes bad taste is more creative than good taste.”[7]
Lagerfeld fights a fear of boredom by channeling his intense energy and curiosity into a variety of activities, any of which could be a separate career. Besides designing his many fashion lines, this multilingual hyphenate is a photographer, director, illustrator, costume designer, and diet guru. He has filled numerous homes with extraordinary decorative arts—and delighted auction houses when he’s put many of these objets under the gavel. His public appearances have superstar overtones. His attendance at the 2005 Tokyo opening of the world’s largest Chanel store drew tears from fans in the crowd. “I witnessed not just one but many grown women weeping as Lagerfeld took to the thoroughfare,”[8] reported André Leon Talley in Vogue. Some 170,000 people follow him on Twitter; even his beloved white Siamese cat, Choupette, a pampered puss who dines on the table with her master, boasts an online following in the thousands.
Although he has a love of the eighteenth century—he views it as both the most polite and the most modern period, a time when “no one was young; no one was old. Everyone had white hair”[9]—Lagerfeld is firmly planted in the now. “Fuck the good old days,” he told Vogue in 2004. “Today has to be okay, too. If not you make something second-rate out of the present.”[10]
With an edge of subversion as his perennial leitmotif, Lagerfeld reinvented and revivified one of the most important and historic brands in the world. And he has brought this same fearlessness into less heady markets, designing wildly successful capsule collections for H&M and Macy’s. When asked why he would lower himself—from designing $3,000 shorts for Chanel to entire dresses for a sliver of the price—he answered in typical fashion: “Because it amuses me.”[11]
Karl Otto Lagerfeldt born in Hamburg to a Swedish father and German mother (once a lingerie saleswoman). After World War I, his father had dominated the condensed-milk market in Europe. Karl will later change his last name to Lagerfeld, claiming that the new variation sounds more commercial. (There will also be some mystery surrounding his exact birth year: He will occasionally claim it as 1938, while the German press in 2003 will produce a baptismal record dated 1933. Lagerfeld, however, will tell Paris Match in 2013 that his birthday is, for certain, September 10, 1935.)
Wins the coats category in a design competition sponsored by the International Wool Secretariat; Yves Saint Laurent wins for dresses. Lagerfeld becomes an assistant to Pierre Balmain.
Leaves Balmain, later saying, “I was not born to be an assistant.”[12] Moves to Jean Patou, where he designs under the name Roland Karl. The Los Angeles Times reports, “Mr. Karl (whose real name is a trade secret) chose his own initial for what he calls the ‘K’ line of his first Patou collection.”[13] He eventually will leave to become a freelancer.
Begins his tenure as head designer for Chloé, where he will remain until 1983—the brand’s headiest period. (He will reprise his Chloé success in the nineties.) Also starts collaboration with Fendi, an alliance that will last for decades. His friend, former French Vogue editor Joan Juliet Buck, later recalls, “They hired him to do the fur, and he throws out these unbelievable challenges: ‘Let’s line fur in fur, let’s knit fur, let’s tear fur up, let’s make holes in fur, let’s paint on fur, let’s paint on shearling.’ ”[14]
Asked by Alain Wertheimer, chairman of Chanel, to design for the label. Later recalls his friends’ advice to decline: “Everybody said, ‘Don’t touch it, it’s dead, it will never come back.’ But by then I thought it was a challenge.”[15]
Debuts first couture collection for Chanel. Carrie Donovan writes in The New York Times, “That Chanel has thrown down the gauntlet, challenging the supremacy of Saint Laurent, seems inescapable, as does the fact that some of the creaks are about to be taken out of that old dinosaur, couture.”[16]
Launches a label under his own name. Tells Vogue, “I’ve not been dreaming all my life to have my name over a shop. Now, we’ll put it there because it’s the right moment to do it; and I made this name, why not use it?”[17]
Viciously criticized in The New Yorker by Holly Brubach for “desecrating the Chanel style with sight gags and overkill, with a tarty sex appeal and crass sensationalism.”[18]
Infuriates global Islamic community when he embroiders phrases from the Koran onto dresses in his spring collection. Chanel hires a bodyguard for supermodel Claudia Schiffer, to protect against threats made by fundamentalists.
Leaves Chloé, and is unimpressed with his replacement, Stella McCartney. “I think they should have taken a big name,” he says. “They did—but in music, not fashion. Let’s hope she is as gifted as her father.”[19]
Announces collaboration with H&M. “I was always quite fascinated by H&M,” he tells The New York Times. “Because people who buy Chanel and other expensive things buy there, too. For me, this is fashion today.”[20]
Sells his brands Lagerfeld Gallery and Lagerfeld to Tommy Hilfiger. Lagerfeld and the 2004 Chanel collection are the subject of a documentary, Signe Chanel. After a public weight loss of more than 90 pounds, publishes The Karl Lagerfeld Diet, in which he states that “fashion is the healthiest motivation for losing weight.” Stages spring Chanel show at Le Grand Palais. Vogue’s André Leon Talley reports that the “Elvis of fashion” told him, “It’s the highlight of my career to show at Le Grand Palais, because I was always made for this place when I came to Paris as a young man. I remember the date, November 19, 1952, the very first time I ever visited Le Grand Palais.”[21]
Announces the launch of a new collection of denim and fitted tees for men and women dubbed K Karl Lagerfeld.
Immortalized as the host of fictional radio station “K109 —The Studio” in the video game Grand Theft Auto IV. “They had written a politically incorrect dialogue,” Lagerfeld says. “I loved it, in a time when everybody wants to be so politically correct.”[22]
February: Walking the red carpet at Lincoln Center, is narrowly missed in a tofu-cream-pie attack by PETA supporters. (Instead, the protesters—shouting “fur pimp” and “fur kills”—peg an innocent, fur-free bystander, Calvin Klein, on the chin.) April: Celebrated as one of Time’s 100 Most Influential People in the World.
Designs a specialty bottle that incorporates his own image for Coca Cola Light in France. Appears as himself in a commercial for Volkswagen.
Directs actress Rachel Bilson in three commercials for Magnum ice cream bars. Creates a capsule collection for Macy’s. “The collaboration is a kind of test how to do this kind of clothes in that price range,” he says. “As you know, I love occasional co-branding. Macy’s is the perfect department store in the U.S., where everybody can find what they’re looking for without ruining their budget.”[23]
February: In Metro’s Paris edition, dishes up a generous helping of Karlist barbs on everything from the singer Adele (“she is a little too fat”) to the Russian populace (“If I was a woman in Russia I would be a lesbian, as the men are very ugly”[24]). March: Karl.com goes live, with a gallery of inspirations and shopping destinations, as well as a library of his—usually somewhat less offensive—bons mots. June: His adored white Siamese cat, Choupette, he says, “is like a kept woman. . . . She has lunch and dinner with me on the table. . . . She sleeps under a pillow and she even knows how to use an iPad. She has two personal maids, for both night and day.”[25] July: Of the Duchess of Cambridge’s sibling, Pippa Middleton, he offers, “I don’t like the sister’s face. She should only show her back.”[26] October: Gives France’s new Socialist president, François Hollande, a thorough tongue-lashing in Spanish Marie-Claire, saying, “He’s an imbecile. . . . Hollande hates the rich . . . and of course, they are leaving, nobody is investing.”[27] (He later claims that some of his words were mistranslated.) November: Creates a holiday cosmetics collection for Shu Uemura, having often used its makeup colors in his fashion sketches and political cartoons.
March: Karl Lagerfeld Draws Himself, a documentary, premieres. He designs for Brazilian jelly-shoe maker Melissa. May: To mark the 100th anniversary of Chanel’s first boutique, he directs the short film Once Upon A Time. . . . , which features Keira Knightley as a young, striving Coco.

Karl Lagerfeld was born in Hamburg in September 1938. A cosmopolitan education and knowledge of languages enabled him to finish his studies in Paris. In 1955 he won the first prize in the contest organized by the secretariat international de la laine (International Wool Association). The coat the young winner designed was produced by Pierre Balmain and at 17 Lagerfeld became the great designer"s assistant. He stayed with him for three years before becoming art director for Jean Patou, where he remained for five satisfying but unusually calm years, for his taste. This relative freedom allowed him to deepen his knowledge in subjects that had passionately interested him for years: history, architecture, music and especially eighteenth century French.When ready to wear came into its own at the beginning of the 60"s, he plunged into a career as an independent stylist in France, Italy, England and Germany. The concept of fur needed modernization to become a viable element of fashion. So, the House of FENDI called on Lagerfeld a collaboration that continues to this day.Perfume is as important as fashion foe Lagerfeld, so in 1975 he launched CHLOE ". He became the first great ready to wear designer to brand a scent globally without first having his own designer label.

He also signed the new collections for CHLOE from 1992 to 1997.His constant interest in new experiences led Lagerfeld to illustrate Hans Christian Anderson"s The Emperor"s New Clothes ". He created as well opera costumes for La Scala, the Florence opera house, the Burgtheater of Vienna and for the Salzbourg festival, and the Monte Carlo ballet.He decided to move behind the lens in 1987, with his first press kit, and from this time on Lagerfeld created his own advertising campaigns. His passion for photography and for books transformed his campaigns into veritable art books (published by Steidl), while continuing photo shoots for prestigious fashion magazines.The year 1997 marked the end of the LAGERFELD Company. In 1998 he began a new adventure. He launched his own label, LAGERFELD GALLERY.November 1999 saw the opening of the bookshop 7L ", followed by the publishing company EDITIONS 7L "in October 2000.

(born Sept. 10, 1938, Hamburg, Ger.) German fashion designer. After moving to Paris at age 14, he went on to create designs for such established labels as Pierre Balmain, Chloe, Valentino, and Fendi. He is best known as the creative power behind the modern revival of the house of Chanel, which he joined in 1983. Lagerfeld consistently managed to merge the spirit of the times with the chic, timeless identity established by the house's founder, Gabrielle Coco Chanel, making Chanel one of the most coveted and influential labels in late 20th-century fashion.
German-French designer of high fashion Karl Lagerfeld (born 1938) won international fame for his work with several Parisian style houses.Fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld was born on September 10, 1938, in Hamburg, Germany. His father was Swedish, from a merchant banker's family, and made the family fortune by introducing powdered milk to Europe. His elegant and fashionable mother was younger than his father, and she adored fragrances; all qualities that would strongly influence Lagerfeld's life and career.Lagerfeld led a sheltered childhood, learning early to speak fluent French, English, and Italian as well as his native German. As a child he was always interested in fashion and pored over history books more for the costume etchings and descriptions than for the battlefield tales. Designing and sketching dresses, he reported, was his favorite childhood pastime.When he was just 14, Lagerfeld was sent to Paris to study, but with the underlying intention of getting involved in the world of French haute couture. This world was then quite sumptuous, as postwar parties were an excuse for women to dress up in the most fanciful finery. Parties, balls, nightclubs, and the like were packed with women wearing the latest fashions. Wealthy women from many countries filled the couture salons, all vying for the reputation of best-dressed.In 1954 Lagerfeld sent one of his sketches to the International Wool Secretariat Competition, open to any young nonprofessional designer. That year there were thousands of entrants. Designers Pierre Balmain, Jacques Fath, and Hubert Givenchy were among the judges. Lagerfeld, just 16, received the award for best coat sketch.Pierre Balmain then offered the young Lagerfeld a job working in his couture house. He took the coveted position, staying there three years, secretly learning all the tricks of the "rag" trade. In 1958, at 20 years old, he became chief designer for the house of Jean Patou, where he worked until 1963, designing two collections each year. But he grew bored and needed more challenges for his frenzied fashion creativity.The idea of working for several houses appealed to him. So in 1963, as a freelancer, he began working for French and Italian design houses, designing fur collections and ready-to-wear for the Fendi sisters. In 1970 he also began designing for the French House of Chloe and in 1975 created their first fragrance, "Chloe." In this time he also launched his own fragrance, "Lagerfeld for Men," followed by "KL" and "KL Homme."In 1983 Lagerfeld, his reputation firmly established as a fashion force, became the creative director and head designer for Chanel, where it was hoped he would breathe new life into the once important but now staid and stagnant house. Coco Chanel had died in 1971, and the name had fallen from fashion favor in the following years. Only a year after joining Chanel, Lagerfeld startled the fashion world by again branching out and creating his own ready-to-wear line called "Karl Lagerfeld" and a lower-priced sporty line, "KL." That year he shocked the world with his press release for his spring Fendi collection, self-described as "shaped to be raped." In USA Today he countered the resultant criticism, saying he was misquoted and misunderstood: "Rape is an abstract word to me. In the kind of atmosphere I live in, nobody rapes anybody." Overcoming the criticism, in 1987 he received France's Golden Thimble award for his Chanel haute couture collection. In 1992 Lagerfeld was drawn back to the House of Chloe, and his first collection was a huge critical success. The self-described "fashion chameleon" said: "When I do Fendi, I am another person from when I do Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld, or KL. It's like being four people in one. Perhaps I have no personality at all, or perhaps I have more than one."However, after the initial spark created in 1992, Chloe struggled to regain its position among fashion houses since Lagerfeld's original reign. In 1997 Lagerfeld stepped down from his position as chief designer at Chloe in order to concentrate more on his own signature line.Like a style shark, Lagerfeld, it seems, never rests. As well as overseeing all of his houses and creating collections for each several times a year, he found time for creative hobbies. A lover of opera, theater, and films, he created costumes for La Scala in Milan, for the Schnitzler plays, and for many films, including The Sun Also Rises, Babette's Feast, Viva le Vie, and Le General de L'Armee Morte. His other hobbies included decorating and restoring old mansions. He was a bachelor and traversed Europe collecting antique furniture and acquiring paintings from the 18th century as well as many forms of modern art. For 12 years he worked on restoring an historic 18th-century French castle in Brittany, right down to the doorknobs. He owned an 18th-century townhouse in Paris, a 200-year-old workshop in Rome, and a summer villa in Monte Carlo that he redid in Louis XVI style. He was renowned for his vast library of fashion and costume history books. Yet the man was nothing if not keenly attuned to modern times; he decorated another Monte Carlo home with furniture and art by the colorfully avant-garde modernistic Memphis design group.He is also an accomplished photographer, shooting all the fashion advertisements for both Chanel and for his House of Lagerfeld. He held gallery photo shows in Paris for his hordes of admirers and fans. His personal style statement is a long ponytail. He maintained: "My father died reading the newspaper when he was over 90. His parents lived to be 98. I'm looking forward to growing old. Ponytails look good with white hair."Further ReadingFor additional information on Karl Lagerfeld and the world of fashion see Couture: The Great Designers by Caroline Rennolds Milbank (1985), Fairchild Dictionary of Fashion (1988), McDowell's Directory of 20th Century Fashion (1987), and Contemporary Designers, edited by Ann Lee Morgan (2nd ed. 1990). 
Lagerfeld, Karl (Karl Otto Lagerfeld), 1938-, German fashion designer, b. Hamburg, immigrated with his family to Paris in 1952. He won a fashion award at 16, designed for couturiers Pierre Balmain (1954-58) and Jean Patou (1958-63), then freelanced for Fendi, Krizia, and Valentino and designed for Chloé (1959-78; 1992-97). In 1982 he was appointed head designer at Chanel, where he revamped the classic Chanel suit into chic updated versions, using offbeat colors and such materials as denim and leather; reinvented the double C logo; accessorized with heaps of gold chain and pearls; and added such items as mini- and maxiskirts, hot pants, and lace-up biker boots to the house repertoire. The pony-tailed, sunglassed, fan-carrying Lagerfeld also has his own KL label (launched in 1984). His lines include neckties, shoes, perfumes, sunglasses, jewelry, and housewares. He is a skilled photographer as well, with several published volumes.BibliographySee his Karl Lagerfeld's Sketchbook (1986); A. Piaggi, Karl Lagerfeld: A Fashion Journal (1986); A.

Karl Lagerfeld (born Karl Otto Lagerfeldt; 10 September 1933) is a German fashion designer, artist and photographer based in Paris. He has collaborated on a variety of fashion and art related projects, most notably as head designer and creative director for the fashion house Chanel. Lagerfeld has his own label fashion house, as well as the Italian house Fendi.
Lagerfeld was born in Hamburg. He has claimed he was born in 1938, to Elisabeth (born Bahlman) and his Swedish father Otto Lagerfeld.[5] He is known to insist that no one knows his real birth date: Interviewed on French television in February 2009, Lagerfeld said that he was "born neither in 1933 nor 1938."[6] His older sister, Martha Christiane (a.k.a. Christel), was born in 1931. Lagerfeld also has an older half-sister, Thea, from his father's first marriage. His original name was Lagerfeldt (with a "t"), but he later changed it to Lagerfeld as "it sounds more commercial."[7]
Lagerfeld grew up as the son of a wealthy businessman from Hamburg who was introducing condensed milk. His family was mainly shielded from the deprivations of World War II due to his father's business interests. (Glücksklee-Milch GmbH) to Germany;[8][9] his mother is from Berlin.[10] According to Alicia Drake,[vague] Lagerfeld's mother, Elisabeth Bahlmann, was a lingerie saleswoman in Berlin when she met her husband and married him in 1930.
After attending a private school, Lagerfeld finished his secondary education at the Lycée Montaigne in Paris, where he majored in drawing and history.[11]

In 1955, at the age of 22, Lagerfeld was awarded a position as an apprentice at Pierre Balmain after winning second place, behind Yves Saint-Laurent, in a competition for a coat design sponsored by the International Wool Secretariat. He told a reporter a few years later, "I won on coats, but actually I like designing coats least of all. What I really love are little black dresses." Yves Saint Laurent also won the contest for a dress design. "Yves was working for Dior. Other young people I knew were working for Balenciaga (Spanish Basque fashion designer and the founder of the Balenciaga fashion house), who they thought was God, but I wasn't so impressed," he recalled in 1976.[citation needed]
In 1958, after three years at Balmain, he moved to Jean Patou where he designed two haute couture collections a year for five years. His first collection was shown in a two-hour presentation in July 1958, but he used the name Roland Karl, rather than Karl Lagerfeld (although in 1962, reporters began referring to him as Karl Lagerfelt or Karl Logerfeld). The first collection was poorly received. Carrie Donovan wrote that "the press booed the collection"[citation needed]. The UPI noted: "The firm's brand new designer, 25-year old Roland Karl, showed a collection which stressed shape and had no trace of last year's sack." The reporter went on to say that "A couple of short black cocktail dresses were cut so wide open at the front that even some of the women reporters gasped. Other cocktail and evening dresses feature low, low-cut backs." Most interestingly, Karl said that his design silhouette for the season was called by the letter "K" (for Karl), which was translated into a straight line in front, curved in at the waist in the back, with a low fullness to the skirt.
His skirts for the spring 1960 season were the shortest in Paris, and the collection was not well received. Carrie Donovan said it "looked like clever and immensely salable ready-to-wear, not couture." In his late 1960 collection he designed special little hats, pancake shaped circles of satin, which hung on the cheek. He called them "slaps in the face." Karl's collection were said to be well received, but not groundbreaking. "I became bored there, too, and I quit and tried to go back to school, but that didn't work, so I spent two years mostly on beaches – I guess I studied life."

After launching himself as a freelance designer, working with brands such as Mario Valentino, Repetto, and the supermarket chain Monoprix and with financial backing from his family, he set up a small shop in Paris. At this time, he would often consult with Madame Zereakian, Christian Dior's Armenian fortune teller. Lagerfeld later said, "She told me I'd succeed in fashion and perfume."
In 1963, he began designing for Tiziani, a Roman couture house founded that year by Evan Richards (b. 1924) of Jacksboro, Texas. It began as couture and then branched out into ready-to-wear, bearing the label "Tiziani-Roma – Made in England." Lagerfeld and Richards sketched the first collection in 1963 together. "When they wound up with 90 outfits, Tiziani threw caution and invitations to the winds, borrowed Catherine the Great's jewels from Harry Winston, and opened his salon with a three-night wingding," according to one report in 1969. Lagerfeld designed for the company until 1969. Elizabeth Taylor was a fan of the label (she referred to Evan as "Evan Tiziani") and began wearing it in August 1966. Gina Lollobrigida, Doris Duke and Principessa Borghese were also customers while Lagerfeld was designing the line. He was replaced in 1969 with Guy Douvier.
Lagerfeld had begun to freelance for French fashion house Chloé in 1964, at first designing a few pieces a season. As more and more pieces were incorporated, he would soon design the entire collection. In 1970, he also began a brief design collaboration with Roman Haute Couture house Curiel (the designer, a woman named Gigliola Curiel, died in November 1969.) His first collection was described as having a "drippy drapey elegance" designed for a "1930s cinema queen."[according to whom?] The Curiel mannequins all wore identical, short-cropped blonde wigs. He also showed black velvet shorts, to be worn under a black velvet ankle-length cape.
His Chloe collection for Spring 1973 (shown in October 1972) garnered headlines for offering something both "high fashion and high camp." He showed loose Spencer jackets and printed silk shirt jackets. He designed something he called a "surprise" skirt, which was ankle-length, pleated silk, so loose that it hid the fact it was actually pants. "It seems that wearing these skirts is an extraordinary sensation," he told a reporter at the time. He also designed a look inspired by Carmen Miranda, which consisted of mini bra dresses with very short skirts, and long dresses with bra tops and scarf shawls.
In 1972, he began to collaborate with Italian fashion house Fendi, designing furs, clothing and accessories.
Starting in the 1970s, Lagerfeld has occasionally worked as a costume designer for theatrical productions. He collaborated with stage directors such as Luca Ronconi and Jürgen Flimm, and designed for theatres like La Scala in Milan (Les Troyens by Hector Berlioz, 1980; directed by Ronconi), the Burgtheater in Vienna (Komödie der Verführung by Arthur Schnitzler, 1980; directed by Horst Zankl), and the Salzburg Festival (Der Schwierige by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, 1990; directed by Flimm).
At the time, he had also been maintaining a design contract with the Japanese firm Isetan, to create collections for both men and women through 30 licenses; had a lingerie line in the US, produced by Eve Stillmann; was designing shoes for Charles Jourdan, sweaters for Ballantyne, and worked with Trevira as a fashion adviser.
In 2002, Karl Lagerfeld asked Renzo Rosso, the founder of Diesel, to collaborate with him on a special denim collection for the Lagerfeld Gallery.[12] The collection, which was titled Lagerfeld Gallery by Diesel, was co-designed by Lagerfeld and then developed by Diesel's Creative Team, under the supervision of Rosso. It consisted of five pieces that were presented during the designer's catwalk shows during Paris Fashion Week[13] and then sold in very strict limited editions at the Lagerfeld Galleries in Paris and Monaco, and at the Diesel Denim Galleries in New York and Tokyo. During the first week of sales in New York, more than 90% of the trousers had already been sold out, even though prices ranged from as high as $240 to $1,840.[14] In a statement after the show in Paris, Rosso said "I am honored to have met this fashion icon of our time. Karl represents creativity, tradition and challenge, and the fact that he thought of Diesel for this collaboration is a great gift and acknowledgement of our reputation as the prêt-à-porter of casual wear."[13]
Lagerfeld designed the costumes for the Carmen sequences in the 2002 film Callas Forever. In 2004, he designed some outfits for the international music artist Madonna, for her Re-Invention tour, and recently designed outfits for Kylie Minogue's Showgirl tour.
Lagerfeld collaborated with the international Swedish fashion brand H&M. On 12 November 2004, H&M offered a limited range of different Lagerfeld clothes in chosen outlets for both women and men. Only two days after having supplied its outlets, H&M announced that almost all the clothes were sold out. Lagerfeld has expressed some fear that working with lower-end brands will taint his image,[citation needed] although in the past he has worked closely with the hosiery designer Wolford.
Lagerfeld is also a photographer. He produced Visionaire 23: The Emperor's New Clothes, a series of nude pictures of models and celebrities. He also personally photographed Mariah Carey for the cover of V magazine in 2005. In addition to his editorial work for Harper's Bazaar, Numéro and the Russian and German editions of Vogue, Lagerfeld photographs advertising campaigns for the houses under his direction (Chanel, Fendi and his eponymous line) every season.
In the 1980s, the Hans Christian Andersen tale "The Emperor's New Clothes" was published with drawings by Lagerfeld.
The designer was also the subject of a French reality series called Signé Chanel in 2005. The show covered the creation of his Fall/Winter 2004–2005 Chanel couture collection. It aired on Sundance Channel in the United States during the fall of 2006.
He has also supported and encouraged the work of up-and-coming designers including Philip Colbert of Rodnik.[citation needed]
On 18 December 2006, Lagerfeld announced the launch of a new collection for men and women dubbed K Karl Lagerfeld. The collection includes fitted T-shirts and a wide range of jeans.[15]
Lagerfeld has signed a deal with Dubai Infinity Holdings (DIH); an investments enterprise that will focus on first-of-its-kind projects in non-conventional growth sectors, in line with their mandate[vague] to fulfil unmet market needs. Lagerfeld is to design limited edition homes[vague] on Isla Moda, the world’s first dedicated fashion island,[vague] set in the iconic[vague] development, The World. This will be a collaboration between Dubai Infinity Holdings and Lagerfeld across the GCC and India.[citation needed]
Lagerfeld is the host of fictional radio station "K109 – The Studio" in the videogame Grand Theft Auto IV.[16]
In 2008, Lagerfeld created a teddy bear in his likeness produced by Steiff in a limited-edition of 2,500 that sold for $1,500.[17] Lagerfeld has been immortalized in many forms: pins, shirts, dolls, and more. In 2009, Tra Tutti began selling Karl Lagermouse and Karl Lagerfelt, mini Lagerfelds in the form of mice and finger puppets respectively.[18]
On 10 September 2010, the Couture Council of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology presented Lagerfeld with an award created for him, "The Couture Council Fashion Visionary Award", at a benefit luncheon at Avery Fisher Hall, New York.[19]
On 10 November 2010, Lagerfeld and Swedish crystal manufacturer Orrefors announced a collaboration for designing a crystal art collection.[20] The first collection was launched in spring 2011 under the name "Orrefors by Karl Lagerfeld".[21]
In the French issue of Architectural Digest in May 2012, Karl Lagerfeld shows off his apartment in Paris.[22] He also revealed his vast collection of Suzanne Belperron's pins and brooches and used the colour of one of her blue chalcedony rings as the starting point for the Chanel spring/summer 2012 collection.[23]
In 1993, he caused US Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour to walk out of his Milan Fashion Week runway show when he employed strippers and adult film star Moana Pozzi to model his black-and-white collection for Fendi.[24]
There was much controversy from Lagerfeld's use of a verse from the Qur'an in his spring 1994 couture collection for Chanel, despite apologies from the designer and the fashion house. The controversy erupted after the 1994 couture show in Paris, when the Indonesian Muslim Scholars Council in Jakarta called for a boycott of Chanel and threatened to file formal protests with the government of Mr. Lagerfeld's homeland, Germany. The designer apologized, explaining that he had taken the design from a book about the Taj Mahal, thinking the words came from a love poem.[25]
Lagerfeld was the target of a pieing by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in 2001 at a fashion premiere at Lincoln Center in New York City. The tofu pies hurled by animal rights activists in protest of his use of fur within his collections, however went astray and hit Calvin Klein. A PETA spokesperson described the hit on Klein as "friendly fire", calling Klein, who doesn't use fur, "a great friend to the animals", while he called Lagerfeld a "designer dinosaur" who continues to use fur in his collections.[26]
Lagerfeld defends the fur industry and the use of fur in fashion, although he himself doesn't wear fur and hardly eats meat. In a BBC interview in 2009 he claimed that hunters "make a living having learnt nothing else than hunting, killing those beasts who would kill us if they could", and maintained that "in a meat-eating world, wearing leather for shoes and clothes and even handbags, the discussion of fur is childish." Spokespersons for PETA called Lagerfeld "a fashion dinosaur who is as out of step as his furs are out of style",[27] and "particularly delusional with his kill-or-be-killed mentality. When was the last time a person's life was threatened by a mink or rabbit?"[28]
In 2010, PETA quotes Lagerfeld, who used fake fur in his 2010 Chanel collection, on their website as saying: "It's the triumph of fake fur … because fake fur changed so much and became so great now that you can hardly see a difference."[29]
Lagerfeld in 2009 joined critics of supermodel Heidi Klum. After German designer Wolfgang Joop called Klum, who had posed naked on the cover of the German edition of GQ magazine,[30] "no runway model. She is simply too heavy and has too big a bust",[31] Lagerfeld followed suit by saying that neither he nor Claudia Schiffer knew Klum as she has never worked in Paris and is insignificant in the world of high fashion, being "more bling bling and glamorous than current fashion."[32]
Lagerfeld created an international furore on 9 February 2012, when he called the singer Adele "A little too fat". This caused instant fury throughout the United Kingdom and Lagerfeld responded with a statement of apology. Adele hit back by saying she is like the majority of women, and she is very proud of that fact.[33][34] Lagerfeld later caused controversy on 31 July 2012 when he criticized Pippa Middleton, sister of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, for her looks. The comment was made when Lagerfeld was praising Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, for her "romantic beauty" before adding "I don't like the sister's face. She should only show her back".[35][36][37]
When Lagerfeld lost 42 kg (roughly 92.6 pounds) in 13 months in 2001, his explanation was "...I suddenly wanted to dress differently, to wear clothes designed by Hedi Slimane," he said anxiously. "But these fashions, modeled by very, very slim boys—and not men my age—required me to lose at least 40 kg. It took me exactly thirteen months." The diet was created specially for Lagerfeld by Dr. Jean-Claude Houdret, which led to a book called The Karl Lagerfeld Diet, which he promoted on Larry King Live and other shows.[7]
