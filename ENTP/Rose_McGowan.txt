Rose Arianna McGowan (born September 5, 1973) is an Italian-born American actress and singer. She has played Paige Matthews in The WB Television Network supernatural drama series Charmed, and Ann-Margret alongside Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Elvis Presley in the CBS mini-series Elvis. In 2008, she was guest programmer and co-host of TCM's film-series program, The Essentials.
She made her film debut in the 1992 comedy Encino Man, where she played a small role. Her performance as Amy Blue in the 1995 dark comedy film The Doom Generation brought her wider attention, and received an Independent Spirit Award nomination. McGowan then appeared in the 1996 hit horror film Scream and starred alongside Ben Affleck in the 1997 coming-of-age feature Going All the Way. Later, she appeared in several Hollywood films, including Devil in the Flesh (1998), Jawbreaker (1999), Ready to Rumble (2000), Monkeybone (2001) and The Black Dahlia (2006). In 2007, she was cast in Planet Terror (2007) as part of the double-feature film directed by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino Grindhouse. She also portrayed the character Grace in the crime thriller film Fifty Dead Men Walking (2008).
In 1996, McGowan was the cover model for the Henry Mancini tribute album Shots in the Dark, and was the face of American clothing company Bebe from 1998 to 1999. She has also appeared on numerous magazine covers, including Seventeen, Interview, Maxim, GQ, Entertainment Weekly and Rolling Stone. She has also frequently been featured on Maxim, FHM and Stuff magazine's sexiest women lists.
McGowan, the second-eldest of six children (plus two half-siblings), was born in Florence, Italy, the daughter of Terri, an American writer of French descent, and Daniel McGowan, an artist of Irish descent. Daniel McGowan ran an Italian chapter of the Children of God, to which both he and his wife held membership until 1978.[1] McGowan spent her early childhood amid the group's communes, often traveling Europe with her parents.[citation needed] Interviewed by Howard Stern, she stated she had avoided the group's calls for members to become sexually active as children ("I waited till I was 14.") and described the practice of 'flirty fishing' as "creepy". Through her father's art contacts in Italy, McGowan became a child model and appeared in Vogue Bambini and various other Italian magazines. Her parents returned to the United States when she was 10, when they divorced. She subsequently relocated to Oregon. McGowan did not speak English until she moved to the U.S.
McGowan's formative years were spent with her father in Seattle, Washington, attending Roosevelt High School and Nova Alternative High School. At the age of 15, she officially emancipated herself from her parents.[2] McGowan pursued a career in the film industry during her late teens while enrolled in a beauty school as a back-up.
McGowan made her first appearance in a Hollywood film with a role in the 1992 Pauly Shore comedy Encino Man. Her role in the 1995 dark comedy The Doom Generation brought her to the attention of film critics, and she received a nomination for "Best Debut Performance" at the 1996 Independent Spirit Awards. McGowan was subsequently cast in a supporting role in the 1996 hit horror film Scream. She was the cover model for the Henry Mancini tribute album Shots in the Dark, which was released in 1996. She became the face of American clothing company Bebe from 1998 to 1999.
McGowan spent the majority of the 1990s appearing in a variety of independent films, including roles in Southie, Going All the Way, and Lewis & Clark & George. In 1997, she appeared in the critically acclaimed short Seed, directed by San Francisco-born filmmaker Karin Thayer, and played opposite Peter O'Toole in the 1998 film adaptation of the Dean Koontz novel Phantoms. Notably, McGowan also starred in the 1998 dark comedy Jawbreaker, where she played a snooty high school student who tries to cover up a classmate's murder. That role earned McGowan a nomination for Best Villain at the 1999 MTV Movie Awards.
In 2001, McGowan was cast as Paige Matthews in the popular The WB television series Charmed, as a replacement lead actress after Shannen Doherty's departure from the show. She was offered to be a producer after the seventh season alongside co-stars Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano, but turned it down.[3] The series ended its run on May 21, 2006.[4]
During and after Charmed, McGowan tackled a variety of different roles. She portrayed actress/singer Ann-Margret in Elvis, a Golden Globe-winning CBS mini-series about the life of Elvis Presley, and also appeared in Brian De Palma's The Black Dahlia.
In 2007, McGowan headlined the critically acclaimed Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez double-feature Grindhouse, released on April 6, 2007. Cast in utterly divergent roles, McGowan appears in both portions of the film, as go-go dancing Cherry Darling in Planet Terror, and as Pam in Death Proof. She followed up the project with a role in the IRA thriller Fifty Dead Men Walking and a recurring role as a con artist on the acclaimed drama series Nip/Tuck. After a brief hiatus from film, McGowan shot a cameo in the Robert Rodriguez thriller Machete, a role ultimately cut but included on the DVD release, and played a semi-homeless junkie in the fantasy drama Dead Awake.
McGowan's name was attached to several recent films which ended up being unmade. Following the release of Grindhouse, she signed to play B-movie staple Susan Cabot in Black Oasis, to be directed by Stephan Elliott.[5] However, the film was affected by the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike and ultimately put on indefinite hold. Another project, a proposed film adaptation of the Sylvia Plath novel The Bell Jar alongside Julia Stiles,[6] also never came to fruition. She was also attached to three projects to be produced by Robert Rodriguez, a remake of the science fiction cult classic Barbarella, a proposed television series titled Women in Chains!,[7] and a big-screen update of the Red Sonja comic books. After several years of development, Rodriguez announced in 2009 that Barbarella had been canceled due to location difficulties,[8] while Women in Chains! appears to have never gotten past the script stages and is believed to no longer be in development.
In addition to film and television, McGowan lent her voice to the video games Darkwatch, playing a femme fatale named Tala, and Terminator Salvation, playing a troubled soldier named Angie Salter. She also co-hosted the TCM's film-series program The Essentials alongside Robert Osbourne in 2008, discussing classic Hollywood film, a subject close to her heart.
In 2010, McGowan confirmed that Red Sonja had been postponed to fit Conan continuity, and that the project may resurface depending on the success of Conan the Barbarian.[9][10][11] In 2011, she appears as an evil half-human/half-witch in the comic book adaptation Conan the Barbarian and guest starred in an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit as a grifter who targets New York sex clubs. McGowan headlined the psychological thriller Rosewood Lane from director Victor Salva, while she appeared in the lead role in the TV movie The Pastor's Wife alongside Michael Shanks. McGowan stars in the feature film The Tell-Tale Heart, an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's short story, which was in post-production in 2012. She will also headline the film Napa, as an Afghanistan war veteran turned Napa county sheriff. In 2013, she played young Cora in a flashback in the show Once Upon A Time. In January 2014, she was casted as Josie Acosta for Chosen, a TV series is aired via Crackle, her role will be main in season 3 of the series, which will be premiere later in 2014. The Tell-Tale Heart also gets an official release date : February 12, 2014, her other movie, Rise of the Lonestar Ranger will be released in March 6, 2014 as well. Moreover, her directorial debut "Dawn" has been premiered at Sundance Film Festival 2014 in Utah.
While dating Marilyn Manson, McGowan appeared in a music video for the song "Coma White",[12] and also performed backing vocals on the song "Posthuman".[13] Both of these songs are available on the album Mechanical Animals.[14]
McGowan appeared on a Brian Transeau track called "Superfabulous" from his album Emotional Technology, which was also featured on the final Charmed soundtrack, The Final Chapter.[15] The song has been featured in several films, including Win a Date with Tad Hamilton![16] and Raising Helen.[17] She wrote and recorded a song titled "Protection," which was featured in her 2001 film Strange Hearts.[18] McGowan has also appeared in the Imperial Teen music video for "Yoo Hoo",[19] which was featured on the Jawbreaker soundtrack.[20] She also recorded the theme song from the 2010 film, Dead/Awake.
McGowan has expressed interest in recording an album of her own. During an interview with Living TV, she said, "I was actually thinking of going back and doing more soulful tunes and older tunes...and I would love to, when I have a little bit more time." In the Charmed episode "Sense and Sense Ability," McGowan performed, in character, a cover of the Peggy Lee classic "Fever". In 2007, it was announced that McGowan would be performing three songs from the Planet Terror portion of Grindhouse. These songs were released on the soundtrack by the Varèse Sarabande label.[21] The songs are entitled "You Belong to Me" (a Dean Martin/Jo Stafford cover), "Useless Talent #32" and "Two Against the World".
McGowan has admitted to sleepwalking as a child: "The weirdest spot I ever woke up was a snow bank in Montreal. Now I just speak Italian in my sleep."[22]
McGowan is an activist for LGBT rights, and campaigned against Proposition 8, which sought to ban same sex marriage in the state of California.[23] McGowan is known as an activist for Boston Terriers. She has two, named Bug and Fester, and has personally donated to various Boston rescues. McGowan reportedly encouraged friends to donate to Boston Terrier Rescue Net, and according to BTRN: "Having fallen in love with Bug and Fester, her friends donated generously. It amounted to a considerable contribution, which will go a long way in helping BTRN and the needy volunteers who selflessly give to deserving Bostons."[24]
McGowan caused controversy during the making of Fifty Dead Men Walking when she stated "I imagine, had I grown up in Belfast, I would 100 per cent have been in the IRA. My heart just broke for the cause. Violence is not to be played out daily and provide an answer to problems, but I understand it."[25]
According to an article in the New York Post, McGowan suffered serious injuries in a car accident early in 2007. Riding as a passenger, her car was struck by another vehicle and the force of the impact drove her eyeglasses into her face. McGowan is quoted as saying, "I didn't realize I was hurt until I put my hand to my face and felt the flap of skin. My glasses had sliced me under my eye." After obtaining the services of a plastic surgeon, McGowan is reported to be suffering no long-lasting consequences from the incident.[26]
Of her acting method, McGowan said "I'm not really one of those people who goes and writes some big backstory and agonizes over characters...For me personally, it's just kind of more instinctive. But I don't have kind of an acting background. I fell into it accidentally."[27]
McGowan was in a very public 3 ½-year relationship with rock musician Marilyn Manson. After a formal engagement lasting two years, McGowan ended the relationship over "lifestyle differences." Prior to the release of Grindhouse, there was speculation that McGowan was dating director Robert Rodriguez.[29][30] In May 2007, it was reported that they confirmed their relationship while appearing hand-in-hand at the Cannes Film Festival.[31] On October 12, 2007, it was announced by Zap2it.com that McGowan was engaged to Rodriguez.[32] They planned to wed in 2009,[33] but reportedly split in October 2009.[34]
After one year of dating, McGowan became engaged to artist Davey Detail in July 2013.[35] They married on October 12, 2013 in Los Angeles.[36]
In 2010 McGowan attended the USO Gala in Washington D.C. to support United States troops[37] and a David Lynch Foundation fund-raising event at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[38]
In 2006, Blender included her on their list of the sexiest women of TV and film.[39] The most recent award won by McGowan was under the category Femme Fatale for the 2007 Spike Guys' Choice Awards, which aired June 13, 2007. The award was for the role of Cherry in Grindhouse. McGowan was nominated for "Scream Queen" at the 2007 Scream Awards on Spike for her performance in Grindhouse.[40] In 2008, she won the Midnight Award at the San Francisco International Film Festival.[41]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Rose McGowan is an American actress and director, known for her contribution to independent film. Born on September 5, 1973 to Terri and Daniel McGowan (of French and Irish origin, respectively), Rose Arianna McGowan is the second eldest of six siblings. She was raised within the Italian chapter of the Children of God, an extremist Christian cult.During the early 1980s, her family severed ties with the community and migrated to Eugene, Oregon, USA. Following the divorce of her parents, Rose relocated to Gig Harbor, Washington, to live with her grandmother. At age 14, McGowan was accused of drug use by a family friend and committed to rehabilitation. She has consistently maintained the decision was unjustified. Upon release, she spent a year without a home and was emancipated from her parents by the age of 15. Her early formal education included attendance at Roosevelt High School and Nova Alternative High School. Further education included qualifications as a licensed beauty operator.McGowan's career as an actor began with The Doom Generation (1995). Originally intended for Jordan Ladd, the character of Amy Blue was, coincidentally, awarded to McGowan by an associate of director Gregg Araki. For her performance, she was nominated at the 1995 Independent Spirit Awards for Best Debut Performance. Subsequently cast in Wes Craven's Scream (1996), she experienced further success when the project defied expectations to become one of the highest grossing films of the year. The innovative career of McGowan was overshadowed throughout much of the 1990s by her high-profile relationship with musician Brian Warner (aka Marilyn Manson). Strong performances in Going All the Way (1997), Lewis & Clark & George (1997), Southie (1998) and Jawbreaker (1999) were largely unseen by the general public. When the relationship ended between Rose and Manson in 2001, she remarked: "There is great love, but our lifestyle difference is, unfortunately, even greater".Rose continued to work solidly, appearing in a string of soft-sounding studio and independent films. Performances from this period included: a political activist in Showtime's The Killing Yard (2001), a grifter in Strange Hearts (2002) and a factory worker in "Stealing Bess" (aka Vacuums (2003)). She was re-introduced to the mainstream as Paige Matthews in Aaron Spelling's Charmed (1998), a popular television series for which she devoted five consecutive years. When "Charmed" finished its run in 2006, McGowan emerged in top form. Critics praised her efforts in Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror (2007), and Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof (2007).In several interviews, McGowan has expressed a general apathy and disdain for Hollywood. Despite this, her work ethic remains strong. Her upcoming projects include an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart (2014), and her directorial debut - untitled at the time of writing.
      Auditioned for the role of Lisa Rowe in Girl, Interrupted (1999), which eventually went to Angelina Jolie.
      Told Howard Stern that she broke up with Marilyn Manson because she tired of the rock and roll lifestyle he engaged in. When pressed further, she admitted that drug use was a big part of that lifestyle. [October 2001]
      The WB network announced that she would be playing Paige Matthews, the long-lost, baby half-sister of Prue, Piper and Phoebe on the television series Charmed (1998). She was cast after Shannen Doherty, who played eldest sister Prue Halliwell, was fired when she refused to sign a two-year contract extension. [June 2001]
      She won the role of Tatum Riley in Scream (1996) after Melinda Clarke turned it down. Coincidentally, the two would later work together when Clarke guest starred on Charmed (1998) in October 2002.
      She ran away at age 9 to escape the Children of God cult that her parents were a part of. River Phoenix, Liberty Phoenix, Summer Phoenix, Rain Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix were also child members of Children of God.

      Collaborated with musician BT on the song "Superfabulous", found on his 2003 CD, "Emotional Technology".
      In the movie Rats (2003), the character Rose is based on the writer's experience with the actress Rose McGowan, and played by character actress Eileen Grubba.

      Asked to have the stripper pole sanitized before doing her go-go dance routine in Planet Terror (2007).
      After Rose's arrival in the United States, the future actress took a brief job at a McDonald's fast food restaurant. During her 5-day stint at the restaurant Rose became a vegetarian in protest of the non-vegetarian options at McDonald's. However, her efforts were pointless and Rose quit the job after just a week.
      She revealed that she still goes to Marilyn Manson (her ex-boyfriend)'s concerts: "What can I say? I'm a groupie but without the sex".
      Her mother, Terri, was a writer, but she now works for Microsoft. Her father, Daniel, is an artist. Her parents divorced by the time she was 10 and she went to live with grandmother in Washington. Rose has two brothers, two sisters and two half siblings.
      When she was 14, she was sent to a drug rehab center because of her appearance, even though she wasn't on drugs. She hated it, ran away and was homeless for a year.
      She was considered a loner in high school. She wore black and spent most of her time in the library.
      She frequently bases her "look" on the style of stars from the 1940s, stating that Marlene Dietrich and Ava Gardner are her "style icons".
      She admires Sophia Loren, Ralph Fiennes, Susan Sarandon, Linda Fiorentino, Clara Bow, Elizabeth Taylor, Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Jessica Lange and Ava Gardner.
      Is mentioned in David Navarro's book "Don't Try This At Home". It features pictures of her alone and also with her ex, rock musician Marilyn Manson.
      One of Rose's favorite episodes on Charmed (1998) was Charmed: Charmed Noir (2004), as she loves anything from the 40s time period, which was what the episode was based upon.
      At age 15, she left to live on her own, legally emancipated, supporting herself with several odd jobs, often having to lie about her age. Living on her own meant being forced to live on the streets for a short time, but despite this she later attended art and beauty school before heading to Los Angeles where she was found outside a gym because thought it was "too corny" and had a chance encounter with independent film director Gregg Araki. Her performance in Araki's dark road movie earned her a nomination for Best Newcomer at the 1996 Independent Spirit Awards.
      She dyed her hair blonde, in order to contrast her black hair from Neve Campbell's, in the horror movie Scream (1996).
      On February 22, 2006, she appeared at UC Irvine to help raise awareness and confront myths about sexual assault on college campuses across the nation. Rose courageously shed her Hollywood image to have a "real talk" with students about the ways that they are affected by alcohol and sexual violence. The event was free and open to the public.
      She made $55,000 per episode in her early years of Charmed (1998), which was bumped up to $102,000 per episode from season 7, onwards.
      (October 12, 2013) Married her boyfriend of a year Davey Detail following a 3-month-long engagement.
      Was supposed to star in the lead role in a remake of Red Sonja (1985). Two promotional posters for the movie were released during the Comic Con in 2008. Both featured McGowan, dressed as Red Sonja with fierce red hair. On one she was licking blood from a sword and on the other she was kneeling on a pile of skulls with red plots flying around her. Both posters promoted the movie to be released in 2009. It was never released that year and the project never materialized.
      You have to work to carve out your own little corner, and I'm certainly smacking my head against the wall trying to make a dent. I just hope I don't get brain-damaged before I get there.
      Hollywood is all about making an entrance. I don't want to be a walking advertisement for anyone other than myself.
      "I always thought I was more satanic than Manson" (Discussing the sinister reputation of her ex-fiancé Marilyn Manson).
      I feel people have tried to stamp out what is special about me. Why should I downplay myself to make someone else more comfortable?
      I'm a pussycat unless you do something to one of my friends. Then I'll think of unique ways to get back at you. I'm more creative than your average bear.
      When I lived in Europe, I was usually pretty exalted for the way I looked. I had minions who would run and get me candy...But when I moved to Oregon and entered my goth phase with spiky black hair, kids threw things at me.
      I don't believe in rules. I would be happy to be climbing a pyramid when I'm 70. And I know I will be.
      I want to live in Paris. I want to learn to ice-skate and to box. I want to get a degree in Egyptology. I would like to not have to say "Like, oh my God!" in any movies. I would like to have a day go by without people screaming various obscenities about body parts. I'd like to still have Bug and Fester, my Boston terriers. I think I'd like to be with my boyfriend, except (laughs) I'm pretty commitment-shy. I'd like to please my father, who used to be in the Children of God, and do at least one more "porno" film - which is what he called The Doom Generation. I'd like to start some sort of counselling program for girls - when I was that age I was always told that I was gonna burn in hell. I would like to lose the guilt I have for compulsive spending. I would like to stop being addicted to diet hot chocolate.
      "I'm a fan of pink, I'm a fan of high-heeled shoes and I'm a fan of strange-looking dogs, so this hits all the notes for me" (At the Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde (2003) premiere).
      I don't really care how people view me particularly. It's not really any of my business because everyone is going to have their own opinion and if I started thinking about what everyone else thought of me, I'd go crazy.
      I think women look better with a little more weight on them. Being super thin makes you look haggard.
      Hollywood is all about making an entrance. I don't want to be a walking advertisement for anyone other than myself.
      People thought (I was wild) because of who I was with (Manson). In reality I've been home baking cupcakes.
      I've always admitted it: I'm a man with really nice breasts - I'm so guilty of doing every single male thing. Not calling, not showing up, leaving at four in the morning.
      I still say I can do whatever I want as long as I'm not hurting anybody else. I don't understand why more people aren't like that.
      If one person starts crying, I'll cry. If one person has no money, I'll give them mine. If I had a bicycle growing up, I always felt incredibly guilty when I see someone sitting at the bus stop.
      I know I am kind and I have fun and if I sat there and worried about what everybody else thought of me my brain would be very crowded.
      I imagine, had I grown up in Belfast, I would 100 per cent have been in the IRA. My heart just broke for the cause. Violence is not to be played out daily and provide an answer to problems, but I understand it.
      I've never come across any uncircumcised men. Actually except for Manson, my boyfriends have always been Jewish.

"I just finished my first piece for RSA Black Dog, which is Ridley Scott's commercial music video company. I directed a 20-minute short with amazing actors. It was a really amazing project to do, and I felt really comfortable doing it, more so than I ever have acting."
Rose McGowan as a baby and young child. Various pictures with her parents and siblings Nathaniel, Daisy and Eva.
Rose Arianna McGowan, the second eldest of six children (plus two half-siblings), was born 5th September 1973 in Florence, Italy to Daniel and Terri McGowan. Daniel is an American artist and Terri a French-American writer, and today a worker for Microsoft. Rose was born in a barn with the assistance of a 89-year old midwife and was raised in communes of the Children of God/The Family cult while her father was the leader of the Italian chapter. "From the outside it would be considered strange, but if you grow up in it, it's normal. I suppose all children are at the mercy of their parents, and whatever trip they happen to be on, and my parents were tripping pretty hard." Overall, Rose regards this period of her life quite positively and mentions often playing outdoors with her siblings and pet lamb. She does not remember so much of the Child of God ideology or being imposed to the scandals  except hairy legs. "It didnt really mess me up being raised in a commune. It was a really idyllic part of my life. I mean, I grew up surrounded by rolling fields and playing in castles that had been cannonballed in the 14th century. What messed me up was moving to the States, she said.
Through her fathers contacts in the art industry, Rose became a child model at the age of three and appeared in Vogue Bambini and various other Italian magazines. She showed exceptional intelligence from an early age. McGowan learned to read at three and by the time she was six, she was already reading "The Raven" and "The Tell-Tale Heart. She was also a very stressed out child who possessed an eye for injustice. Apparently, I'd get very angry if my dad wasn't treating my mom right, or if I saw any injustice. The legend tells that McGowans father left her mother for the nanny when Rose was nine years old and they divorced shortly after. 
After the events, the McGowan family returned to the States when Rose was 10-years old. She ended up living in Oregon with her mother. Of all the horrible places to live in, my mother had randomly chosen Oregon, which was Tonya Harding Land. All the kids in the school I went to had that little chicken-hawk, feathery thing going on with their hair, and every one of them came up to me in the first week and said, You're the ugliest thing I've ever seen! I was pretty much in the smart-kid classes, so I was with the eight kids who were total outcast nerds with bad dandruff. Already at such a young age, she had a unique style that set her apart from the rest of the crowd. I had short, choppy, dyed, jet-black hair and I wore red lipstick. I still have four little '40s-style men's suits that were my favorites from this one shoot that I did. I wore them all the time. I certainly looked strange. Rose, who did not really fit into any box or clique, would often hide in the library and disappear reading a good book. I'd live with one foot in a book, and one foot in reality, and every week I'd have a different accent.  
Rose began working at age 13, and her favorite job was as an usherette at a movie theater. When 14, one of her mother's then-boyfriends - a 28-year old surfer dude - convinced her mother, Terri, that Rose was doing drugs because she was thin and always wore black. She was locked up in a drug rehab clinic, although she has insisted she never had a problem. Released, McGowan was homeless for a year before teaming up with a new friend. Together they roamed all over Oregon and Washington. I've always been a wanderer, she says. Next Rose traveled to Portland, where she would safely hang out and dance the night away at gay clubs without being disturbed by men Except she was once gay bashed and knocked unconscious because someone thought she was a lesbian! But this isn't even an eighth of the things that happened to me. My formative years were like Mr. Toad's wild ride. As a result, things don't faze me much anymore.
Rose emancipated legally from her parents at the age of 15, even representing herself in the court! She went on to live in Seattle with her aunt and attended Roosevelt High School. Rose also went to an art school for a while and then stayed in Montreal with her father.
Rose's first movie role in Encino Man (1992) and her breakthrough role as Amy Blue in The Doom Generation (1995).
Eventually, Rose McGowan traveled to Los Angeles to visit an actor friend. She scored an appearance in the FOX series True Colors in 1990 and made her silver screen debut in 1992's Encino Man with a bit part as Nora. During this time, she was in a bad place mentally because her boyfriend had recently died. "There's a saying that God doesn't give you more than you can handle, but I continually got more and more, and when my boyfriend died, I just snapped. I'd held up for so long, but I couldn't be strong anymore." In her own words, it all came crumbling down.
But four months later a chance encounter brought Rose McGowan The Doom Generation and the role of Amy Blue. "There's this gym on Beverly Boulevard that I call 'Butt Row' because you can see all these butts going up and down on the StairMasters. I refused to go in on principle because I thought it was tacky. So I was standing outside and my friend cam back out with one of Gregg Araki's best friends, and somehow I wound up getting offered the role of Amy in The Doom Generation. It was wild because physically, the way my character looked in that movie was an homage to my fifteen-year-old self." As Rose regained her strength back from the breakdown, she used it to get through the filming of The Doom Generation, channeling her grief into acting. "It entailed working fifteen hours a day and doing sex scenes at seven in the morning before I went home. It was very hard, but what I appreciated about it was that it was boot camp for movies. It was sink or swim, and obviously I'm a survivor so I tried to swim as much as possible."
After the intense shooting of The Doom Generation, which mainly took place during the nights, Rose McGowan went back to living with her father in Seattle. The idea of acting as a career slipped her mind so she enrolled in a beauty school and worked at her aunt's beauty salon. "With my money that I got from The Doom Generation, I finished the last two months that I had to do in beauty school. That is how I became the licensed beauty operator." While Rose was still working at the salon, The Doom Generation premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1995 and Gregg Araki took his actors with him to promote the film. The innovative and stylish film gained praise and brought Rose's name to everyone's lips. A critic said of her performance: "In the lead role, debutante McGowan is highly photogenic, commanding the screen with the ease and assuredness of a pro." 
"At the Sundance Film Festival, I was this little fish among sharks. I couldn't figure out why all these lawyers were giving me their cards", Rose said. Shortly after she decided to move to Los Angeles and pursue acting. Rose also took classes at UCLA and, as usual, read a lot. The Doom Generation opened in October and it gained Rose an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Debut Performance.
1996-1997, as Tatum Riley in Scream, stealing the scene in Lewis & Clark & George, a pin-up dream in Going All the Way, and an image of Rose from the long lost short film, Seed.
More movie roles followed. In 1996 Rose had a small role in Bio-Dome as Denise, an environmentally conscious party girl. In the trippy and crazy Kiss & Tell, she portrayed Denise. McGowans rising star caught the eye of Wes Craven and he cast her as Tatum Riley in Scream, a movie that would be a huge success and re-evoke the slasher genre. Roses Tatum was a witty and sassy teenager, who met her demise at the hands of the killer. Although getting killed off meant no roles in the sequels, Tatums memorable death scene surely made film history and the performance gained more name to the rising actress.
Rose next went on to star as George in Lewis & Clark & George (1997). The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and never did gain wide release but her unforgettable performance as the silent con artist George still remains one of the fan favorites. McGowan also had a supporting role in Going All the Way and a cameo in Arakis Nowhere. She also portrayed Miriam in short film Seed, of which Rose said: "It's the favorite thing I've done lately. 
The press immediately fell in love with McGowan because of her photogenic beauty, sharp intelligence and sarcastic sense of humor. Her publicist suggested that she should tone it down for the media but Rose kept on doing her own thing. She graced the covers of several magazines, including multiple times in Interview and Bikini and was featured on the sexiest women lists of mens magazines all over the world.
The Manson years. Rose starring alongside her idol, Peter O'Toole, in Phantoms, and seducing audiences in Devil in the Flesh.
In late 1997 Miss McGowan met shock rocker Marilyn Manson at the premiere of Gummo. Manson had just moved to Hollywood and said, "The only person I want to meet is Rose McGowan." Rose had a boyfriend at the time but was unhappy in that relationship and ended it. "We went to this bar and she started dancing really sexy dancing to Iron Maiden, which I thought, if a girl can dance to Iron Maiden, this is the girl that I'm going to be with forever, Manson said of Rose. She moved in with him shortly after and they fell deeply in love.
Besides finding happiness with Marilyn Manson, Rose McGowan was busy starring in films in 1998. She signed up to play Lisa in Phantoms, her first big movie since Scream, to be able to work with Peter O'Toole. She would spend time hanging out with him in his trailer drinking tea and then after they finished filming, they continued to exchange letters. Southie provided Rose the meaty role of Kathy Quinn. The film went on to win Best Picture at the 2000 Seattle Film Festival. While Rose herself is not a huge fan of the movie, Devil in the Flesh still remains one of her most memorable roles as the psychotic Debbie Strand. Rose also did a series of sexy print ads for Bebe clothing in 1998.
Marilyn Manson cast his muse in his music video for "Coma White" and composed songs and painted portraits of her. Rose went on tour with his band, as the couple did not want to be apart for more than seven days. On February 12, 1999, in a bathtub surrounded by candles, Manson gave Rose a beautiful ring dating back to 1930s, and asked her to marry him. Despite her commitment phobia, she said yes and announced the engagement on Howard Stern's radio show. Rose and Manson never set a date but they did buy a house together.
Busy times - as the unforgettable Courtney Shayne, roles in Ready to Rumble, The Last Stop, Monkeybone, and playing Moira in Strange Hearts.
Rose McGowan next took on the starring role of Courtney Shayne in the dark teen comedy Jawbreaker (1999). The role still remains one of Roses personal favorites: "I love Courtney Shayne, she was hilarious. She was very misunderstood. People said she was so evil and I say, Well, she was just a 
sociopath. Jawbreaker gained Rose many new fans and an MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Villain. She also had a role as the dead rock goddess Sno Blo in Sleeping Beauties, a short film.
After taking some time off from the movies to be with her fiancé, Rose couldnt seem to find roles that really challenged her. In 2000 she was seen in supporting roles in Ready to Rumble and The Last Stop. She next had small roles in Monkeybone and The Killing Yard before starring in as the vulnerable and confused Moira Kennedy in Strange Hearts. Although none of these movies were great successes in terms of box office or critical response, they once again proved Roses versatility as an actress and her great charisma. "Yep, I have made some bad films, she admitted. But unlike Kate Hudson or Gwyneth Paltrow I didn't grow up in Hollywood, with stability and wealth and all my needs were catered to. I came here trying to survive. I couldn't afford to make worthy, artistic movies for no money. I had to pay the rent.
Different eras: Rose in the movies Elvis (2005) and Brian De Palma's The Black Dahlia (2006) Conjuring up some magic as Paige on Charmed (2001-2006).
2001 bought huge life changes to Ms. McGowan. In January, she announced that her relationship to Manson was over. "There is great love, but our lifestyle difference is, unfortunately, even greater." Rose refused to talk about the break-up publicly for a while but later on said that she couldn't deal with Manson's drug abuse. "I couldn't take his lifestyle. The drugs - more than you could imagine. I realized it wasn't a lifestyle I wanted to be married to. I have never been a rock chick."
On a brighter note, Rose McGowan was offered a two-year contract on the hit WB series Charmed as the long lost witch sister Paige Matthews and she took up on it. Her contract kept getting renewed and every year it did she would cry. Rose said that the biggest positives about starring in a TV series included the steady pay and being able to follow the character for such a long period of time. She was also proud of the fact that Charmed still remains one of the longest running female-run shows. "The coolest thing is that I'm very pro-women and certainly not afraid to call myself a feminist, unlike a lot of women these days. It is not a remotely dirty word and what the best thing about Charmed is that it is completely pro-women, strong women. It might be high heels and mini-skirts but you're still kicking somebody's ass." Most of all, it caused Rose personal growth and gave her the kind of family that she never really had growing up. "Charmed has probably caused more personal growth than I would have thought. I was an extremely undisciplined person. If I didn't like something, I would move. If I didn't like a city, I would leave. Having to work without those parameters... I suppose it is more adult."
Despite the demanding working hours that came with Charmed, Rose managed to film roles in the musical comedy Stealing Bess (2002), Elvis Presley biopic Elvis (2005) and Brian De Palmas neo-noir The Black Dahlia (2006). In 2003 she also sang vocals on the song "Superfabulous" for BTs album Emotional Technology, which became a surprise hit. Rose had a three-year relationship with David Zinczenko, the editor of Men's Health magazine. Despite Rose being located in Los Angeles for Charmed and David residing in New York, the couple was able to make their relationship work for several years. They would spend the weekends together, both communing to the opposite sides of the US for each other.
Two years turned into a five-year tour-de-force performance for Rose McGowan and 2006 marked the end for Charmed. The final episode, Forever Charmed, aired on 21st May and gave a happy ending to Paige Matthews and her witchy sisters. 
The end of Charmed meant that Rose McGowan was now free to return to the big screen. She had met Robert Rodriguez at the Cannes Film Festival in 2005 and ended up talking to him for hours about, among other things, the double standards in films. Rodriguez remembers: "We were sitting around, I was talking to Clive Owen, and then turned around and met Rose, and I was like 'what are you up to?' and she told me she'd been stuck on a TV show for five years, and I was like 'Oh, no wonder I haven't seen you around. You were a Dimension girl for a while, you were in Scream Then, like, gone.' I didn't know what happened to her. And I started talking to her  she's hilarious. She really just caught me off guard. When you meet somebody like that, that has a personality that's so strong in person, you know that if they can blow it up 50 times on a screen, it's going to be amazing. You get that epiphany of 'I want you to be in my movie, but as you are.' People tell her she should be a stand-up, she's so accident-prone, she has the worst luck, there are just so many things about her. She's always talking about her useless talents. I was like taking notes  'All I have to do is add a machine-gun leg to her, and she'd be over the top.'"
Later, Rodriguez called her and said "I'm going to put you in my movie. I am going to change things for you." Six months later, Rose auditioned for the role of Cherry Darling in Planet Terror and she, of course, nailed it. First wounded, then equipped, and finally empowered, one night changed Cherry, just like the movie changed the career of Miss McGowan, forever. Rose also starred as Pam in the other half of Grindhouse, Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof. Dimension Films wasn't sure about letting her be in both but she lobbied hard, auditioned several times and ultimately landed the role. Grindhouse opened in the US on April 6, 2007. Unfortunately, its box office numbers were a disappointment but the reviews were hugely positive and praised McGowan's performance. Veteran critic Richard Roeper commented: "In the performance of her life, McGowan throws herself into the juicy, sexy, funny, comic book hero role of Cherry Darling." Both of the Grindhouse films were later on released separately abroad and the extended cut of Death Proof premiered and competed at the Cannes Film Festival in May.
In late 2007 reports broke out that Rose and Robert Rodriguez had gotten engaged. "He's my best friend. We instantly became really good friends," said Rose back in June 2007. Engagement rumors swirled for months as the couple attended Hollywood events, and with McGowan sporting a large diamond ring on her wedding finger. Finally, in October 2008 Rose confirmed to USA Today that they were indeed engaged and set to marry. Of the proposal itself, Rose said: "It was lovely and very personal." However, Rose and Robert went their separate ways in 2009.
The Essential Rose McGowan: co-hosting duties on TCM, Fifty Dead Men Walking, playing a villain on Nip/Tuck, on the set of Dead Awake and, finally, Rose out and about in 2009.
Rose McGowan was next rumored to take leading roles in Robert Rodriguez' Barbarella and Sin Ciy 2 and was officially announced to star in Black Oasis as the 1950s B-movie queen Susan Cabot. Unfortunately, the film was one of the many affected by the writer's strike and like Barbarella and Sin Ciy 2, it was put on hold. Director Stephan Elliott moved on to film Easy Virtue, starring Jessica Biel and Colin Firth, while Rose herself embarked on a whole different journey: the role of Grace, a woman who is in the highest level of the IRA in Fifty Dead Men Walking. The movie was filmed in Ireland and saw Rose act alongside veteran actor Sir Ben Kingsley and up and comer Jim Sturgess. Fifty Dead Men Walking premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 2008 and was released in the UK in April 2009 with warm reviews.
Miss McGowan, a great lover of the Golden Age of Hollywood, appeared as a Guest Programmer on Turner Classic Movies in November 2007. Rose co-hosted a series of her favorite films with TCM's Robert Osborne. Her enthusiasm impressed the heads of TCM so Rose's one-time gig developed into a full series, The Essentials, which she again co-hosted with Osborne. "During our many shoots with Guest Programmers this year, we encountered a lot of celebrities who impressed us with their knowledge and love of classic film," said Tom Brown, vice president of original programming for TCM. "But Rose really stood out, because she was so passionate and insightful. We thought it would be great for her to share her passion with the audience by co-hosting The Essentials in 2008." Says Rose herself: "When they called me up to do this, I was just thrilled. I didn't even know I was going to get paid. I was so excited, I would have done it for free." The Essentials kicked off March 8, 2008 and concluded on January 31, 2009.  
McGowan filmed a guest stint for the FX network's Nip/Tuck between 2008 and 2009. Rose replaced Katee Sackhoff in the role of Theodora "Teddy" Rowe, a villainous doctor and love interest for Sean (Dylan Walsh), for five episodes during the show's sixth season. The role was a different one for Rose and the actress was able to show her versatility and subtle acting quality in a role that could very easily have been over the top if played by another. Rose also filmed a cameo appearance for Robert Rodriguez's Machete (2010), an expansion of the fake trailer that he created for Grindhouse.
Next Rose McGowan geared up for something else entirely; an indie film Dead Awake (2010, aka Dylan's Wake) and the role of Charlie, a schizophrenic drug addict who finds friendship with Nick Stahl's Dylan. It is the story of a young man who fakes his own funeral to see who will show up, befriends Rose's Charlie and is reunited with an old love from his past (Amy Smart). In result, the lives of these three characters are transformed by supernatural forces as Dylan discovers that no one is who they seem to be. "I'm having an amazing and fulfilling time," Rose said on the set of the film. "I love my castmates, the director and the kindest producers I've ever worked with." Dead Awake saw a limited North American release on December 3, 2010 and was released on DVD and Blu-ray shortly after.
Rose McGowan's next big screen venture was Marcus Nispel's Conan the Barbarian (2011), which was filmed in Bulgaria during the spring of 2010. Rose kicked ass and took names in the role of Marique, an evil half-human, half-witch. Based on the Robert E. Howard books, Conan the Barbarian centers on the mythical hero driven to avenge the murder of his father and the slaughter of his village. The film was released on August 19, 2011. In their review of the film, Hollywood Reporter noted that "Rose McGowan's snakelike witch is pure villainy" while Den of Geek said that Rose is "seemingly having the time of her life portraying a monstrous lunatic, which all adds to the films' unashamed craziness."
McGowan next took on the role of radio talk show psychiatrist Dr. Sonny Blake in Rosewood Lane (2011). As she moves back to her hometown, Sonny discovers that the neighborhood is terrified of the local paperboy. When he starts to exhibit abnormal abilities and wage a war of terror on her, Sonny begins to doubt her own sanity. The Victor Salva directed thriller premiered at ScreamFest on October 15, 2011.
Also in 2011, Rose appeared in the Lifetime movie The Pastor's Wife, which centers on the 2006 death of Matthew Winkler (Michael Shanks), a beloved minister and community leader who was mysteriously shot and killed in his Tennessee, home. During their investigation, the authorities zero in on Matthews wife, Mary, played by McGowan. The film showcases a completely different side of Rose. As Mary Winkler, a wife and a mother of three children, she is soft-spoken, timid and even invisible to those around her - quite a departure from the roles Rose is best known for! However, as the title of the movie implies, The Pastors Wife puts the actress and her character front and center of the story, which allows Rose to act out a wide range of intense emotions. McGowan received warm reviews for her rerformance. Variety noted that: "While McGowan has a diverse resume, she's perfectly convincing as the Southern wife who can solemnly drawl of her late husband, 'I could never do anything right in his eyes.'"
In October 2011, Rose headed down to New Orleans to film The Tell-Tale Heart, a film adaptation of Edgar Allan Poes classic short story of the same title. Rose portrays Ariel, a character specifically written for the John La Tier directed movie. "Poes story does not have a female character in it, so I was very curious to see how that would be woven into the script. Its really seamless and it almost seems like it could be part of the original story, and I think Poe would be very pleased," said McGowan. The Tell-Tale Heart is due for release in August 2012. In 2011, Rose showed her comedic chops as the iconic cartoon sexpot Betty Boop in a hilarious Funny or Die trailer parody titled Boop. In 2012, she made a cameo appearance in the music video for Hollywood by RAC.
After Rose's critically acclaimed performances in Planet Terror and The Pastor's Wife, she is surely to be seen more on the silver screen. As Robert Rodriguez puts it: "Rose is so unique, captivating, witty, beautiful, and yet hilariously self-deprecating that I just remember asking her in complete befuddlement, 'Where have you been? You should be starring in movies.' I immediately felt a sense of responsibility to get her not just back onto the big screen but to put her front and center." And that is exactly where McGowan belongs.
Rose McGowan is currently residing in Los Angeles with her dogs Happy and Sasquatch. Unfortunately, her two other beloved pups Fester and Bug passed away in 2008 and 2010, respectively. In her free time Rose enjoys baking, karaoke, traveling and collects vintage furniture. McGowan is a great dog lover and is involved with The Boston Terrier Rescue Net. She also tirelessly lobbies for LGBT rights, and campaigned against Proposition 8, which sought to ban same sex marriage in the state of California. Rose actively supports AIDS awareness and research. In 2011, Rose was named the Ambassador for Coalition for Pulmonary Fibrosis, with the mission of building awareness to fight the lung disease that took her father's life in 2009. Her future dreams include filming a Clara Bow biopic and recording her own album. 
"I'm a pretty swell gal," Rose says. "I don't mean any harm to anybody. Generally speaking, for a melancholy person, I'm pretty happy."

Appearing as a cross between Betty Boop's evil sister and a very curvaceous Hell's Angel, actress Rose McGowan made an undeniably distinct impression on Hollywood in the late '90s. With her sharp tongue and brash sensuality, McGowan has been a source of both titillation and discomfort to an industry that still hasn't quite figured out what to do with women who are both unapologetically smart and sexual. The child of hippies, McGowan was born September 5, 1975, in Florence, Italy, to a French mother and Irish father. The second oldest of six children, McGowan was raised on an Italian commune run by the Children of God cult. The controversial cult was known for panhandling as well as for taking extremely liberal approaches to parenting. Her family relocated to Oregon when McGowan was ten, and she left the commune at 15, legally emancipating herself from her parents. She supported herself with a variety of odd jobs and even lived on the streets for awhile before traveling to Los Angeles to attend an arts school. It was there that she was discovered by director Gregg Araki, who encountered her loitering outside a gym, refusing to go in because it was "too corny." Araki was busy casting his Sundance entry, The Doom Generation, and gave her the role of Amy Blue, the film's beautiful, spoiled, and morally ambiguous protagonist. Prior to her role, McGowan had only appeared as a minor character in 1992's Encino Man, making her casting in Araki's film all the more fortuitous. The Doom Generation was released in 1995, to mixed reviews and a fair amount of controversy, but helped to establish McGowan as, if not Hollywood's Next Big Thing, then Internet fodder for slavering males everywhere. The film also gave her a greater chance at steady work and she followed The Doom Generation with the low-budget thriller Kiss and Tell (1996). Subsequently, she landed a role in another thriller possessing a decidedly bigger budget, Wes Craven's Scream (1996). The film was a surprise hit and McGowan's turn as a frisky student who has an unfortunate encounter with a garage door further widened her fan base. After starring in the 1997 TV movie Devil in the Flesh, McGowan appeared in two back-to-back movies with fellow rising star Ben Affleck. First came her turn as the girl who tries to seduce a very excited Jeremy Davies in 1997's Going All the Way, followed by her role in the ski slope thriller Phantoms (1998). 1999 saw her take the lead in the independent film Jawbreaker, in which she starred with Rebecca Gayheart. As Alpha Bitch Courtney Shane, McGowan excelled in a role that was equal parts vamp, tramp, and camp. During this same period, McGowan began a relationship with gothy shock-rocker Marilyn Manson. The counter-culture pair seemed like a match made in entertainment heaven and she caused quite a stir by accompanying her beau to the 1998 MTV Movie Awards in a dress that consisted of little more than a few strands of black beads draped over her distinctly visible nude body. The two became engaged but eventually broke up over reported lifestyle differences.  In 2001, a new period began in McGowan's career when star Shanen Doherty left the hit WB show Charmed, leaving directors looking for a witchy, raven-haired actress to replace her. McGowan joined costars Alyssa Milano and Holly Marie Combs and found no trouble connecting with the show's fans, staying with the series for five years--two years longer than her predecessor. As the show was wrapping up in 2006. McGowan signed up for another role that fit perfectly with her screen image. Dark, sexy, and kitschy beyond a shadow of a doubt, the over-the-top flick Grindhouse would pair the actress with directors Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, who would each direct a full length film for the double feature. The starlet would have a small but memorable role in Tarantino's Death Proof, but she would have the starring role in Rodriguez's feature Terror Planet as a leg amputee whose appendage is replaced by a big, shiny machine gun.  Over the next several years, McGowan would enjoy a successful arc on Nip/Tuck, as well as appearances in films like Conan the Barbarian and Rosewood Lane. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi

She greeted the millennium with two films, Ready To Rumble and Monkeybone But it was on TV that she gained her greatest fame when in 2001, she was cast as Paige Matthews, the long-lost, baby half-sister of Prue, Piper and Phoebe on the hit series Charmed. She was cast after Shannen Doherty, who played eldest sister Prue Halliwell, was fired when she refused to sign a two-year contract extension.
Currently McGowan lives in Los Angeles, California with her two dogs. She was engaged to Marilyn Manson in 1998 and ten years later, to her Grindhouse director, Robert Rodriguez.
