This article is about the rock singer and lead vocalist for the Banshees and the Creatures.  For the Korean-American alternative folk singer, see Susie Suh.
Siouxsie Sioux (/ˈsuːziː suː/, born Susan Janet Ballion,[1] 27 May 1957) is an English singer-songwriter. She is best known as the lead singer of rock band Siouxsie and the Banshees (1976–1996) and of its splinter group The Creatures (1981–2005). The Banshees produced 11 studio albums and a string of hit singles including "Hong Kong Garden", "Happy House", "Peek-a-Boo" and "Kiss Them for Me". With the Creatures, Siouxsie recorded four studio albums and the hit single "Right Now". She has also sung with artists such as Morrissey[2] and John Cale.[3] In the mid-2000s, she began a solo career and released Mantaray in 2007.
Siouxsie is considered to be "one of the most influential British singers of the rock era".[4] Her songs have been covered by Jeff Buckley,[5] Tricky,[6] Massive Attack,[7] and LCD Soundsystem.[8] Her records have also been praised by a wide range of other artists including PJ Harvey[9] and TV on the Radio.[10] In 2011, she was awarded for Outstanding Contribution to Music at the Q Awards[11] and in 2012, at the Ivor Novello Awards, she received the Inspiration Award.[12]
Siouxsie was born Susan Janet Ballion[13] on 27 May 1957 at Guy's Hospital in Southwark, Central London, England.[14] She was the youngest of three children; 10 years separate her from her elder brother and sister. Her two elder siblings were born while the family was based in the Belgian Congo.[14] Her parents met in that colony and stayed working there for a few years. Her mother, Betty, was a bilingual English secretary and her father was a bacteriologist who milked venom from snakes. He was a Belgian Walloon from the French-speaking part. In the late 1950s, before Siouxsie's birth, the family moved to England. The Ballions lived in a suburban district, in Chislehurst in Kent (now south-east London). Siouxsie had an isolated youth. Her comrades invited her home but she couldn't reciprocate as her father drank at home and didn't work.[15] She was aware of her family being different.[16] The Ballions weren't part of the community. Their house was different: elsewhere, "life in all its normality was being paraded". She later said: "the suburbs inspired intense hatred".[16]
At the age of nine, Susan and a friend were "seriously sexually assaulted". The more damaging aspect being the assault was "totally ignored" by her parents.[17] The episode became an unspoken item. From that moment, she started to acquire disrespect for adulthood.[18] Years later, she stated : "I grew up having no faith in adults as responsible people. And being the youngest in the family I was isolated - I had no-one to confide in. So I invented my own world, my own reality. It was my own way of defending myself - protecting myself from the outside world. The only way I could deal with how to survive was to get some strong armour."[18]
Her father died prematurely when Siouxsie was 14 years old, resulting in an immediate adverse effect on her health. She lost a lot of weight and missed school. After several misdiagnoses, she was operated on and survived a bout of ulcerative colitis.[19] During the weeks of recovery in summer 1972, she watched television in the hospital and first saw David Bowie on Top of the Pops.[18]
At 17, she left school. It was during this period that she began frequenting the local gay discos where most of her sister's friends used to go.[20] She introduced her own friends to that scene. In November 1975, a new young group called the Sex Pistols performed at the local art college in Chislehurst. Siouxsie did not attend, but one of her friends told her how their singer threatened the string of students present at that gig. He added that they sounded like the Stooges. In February 1976, Siouxsie and her friend Steven Severin (then still called Steven Bailey) went to see the Pistols play in the capital. After chatting with members of the band, Siouxsie and Severin decided to follow them regularly.[21] In the following months, journalist Caroline Coon coined the term "Bromley Contingent" to describe this group of eccentric teenagers devoted to the Sex Pistols.[22]
Siouxsie became well known in the London club scene for her glam, fetish and bondage attire, which later became part of punk fashion.[18] She would also later epitomise gothic style with her signature cat-eye makeup, deep red lipstick, spiky dyed-black hair, and black clothing.[18]
In early September 1976, the Bromley Contingent followed the Pistols to France, where Siouxsie was beaten up for wearing a black armband with a swastika on it. She claimed her intent was to shock the bourgeoisie, not to make a political statement.[23] She later wrote the song "Metal Postcard (Mittageisen)" (in memory of the anti-Nazi artist John Heartfield).[24]
Following the adage of DIY and the idea that the people in the audience could be the people on stage, Siouxsie and Severin decided to form a band. When a support slot at the 100 Club Punk Festival (organised by Malcolm McLaren) opened up, they decided to make an attempt at performing, although at that time they did not know how to play any songs. On 20 September 1976, the band improvised music as Siouxsie recited poems and prayers she had memorised. This "Lord's Prayer" performance lasted 20 minutes.
For critic Jon Savage, Siouxsie was "unlike any female singer before or since, commanding yet aloof, entirely modern."[25] She opened a new era for women in music as Viv Albertine from The Slits would later comment:
"Siouxsie just appeared fully made, fully in control, utterly confident. It totally blew me away. There she was doing something that I dared to dream but she took it and did it and it wiped the rest of the festival for me, that was it. I can't even remember everything else about it except that one performance."[26]
One of Siouxsie's first public appearances was with the Sex Pistols on Bill Grundy's television show, on Thames Television in December 1976. Standing next to the band, Siouxsie made fun of the presenter when he asked her how she was doing. She responded: "I've always wanted to meet you, Bill". Grundy, who was drunk, suggested a meeting after the show. That directly provoked a reaction from Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones, who responded with a series of expletives never heard before on early-evening television.[27] This episode created a media furore on the front covers of several tabloids, including the Daily Mirror with the headline "Siouxsie's a Punk Shocker". This event had a major impact on the Sex Pistols' subsequent career, and overnight, they became a household name.
Not liking the clichés put forward by the press, Siouxsie distanced herself from that scene and stopped seeing the Sex Pistols. She decided to focus all her energy on her own band, the Banshees.[28]
In 1977, Siouxsie began touring in England with Severin on bass guitar as Siouxsie and the Banshees. One year later, their first single, "Hong Kong Garden," reached the top 10 in the UK.[29] With its oriental-inflected xylophone motif, it was depicted by critics as "a bright, vivid narrative, something like snapshots from the window of a speeding Japanese train, power charged by the most original, intoxicating guitar playing heard in a long, long time."[30]
Their first album, 1978's The Scream, was described by Nick Kent in the NME in the following terms:[31] "The band sounds like some unique hybrid of The Velvet Underground mated with much of the ingenuity of Tago Mago-era Can, if any parallel can be drawn." At the end of the article, he added this remark: "Certainly, the traditional three-piece sound has never been used in a more unorthodox fashion with such stunning results." The Scream was later hailed by the NME as one of the best debut albums of all time along with Patti Smith's Horses.[32] Join Hands followed in 1979.
The 1980 album Kaleidoscope marked a change of musical direction with the arrival of John McGeoch, considered "one of the most innovative and influential guitarists of the past 30 years".[33] The hit single "Happy House" was qualified as "great pop" with "liquid guitar"[34] and other songs like "Red Light" were layered with electronic sounds. Kaleidoscope widened Siouxsie's audience, reaching the top 5 in the UK charts. Juju followed in 1981, reaching number 7; the singles "Spellbound" and "Arabian Knights" were described as "pop marvels" by the Guardian.[35] During recording sessions for Juju, Siouxsie and drummer Budgie formed a percussion-oriented side project called The Creatures, inspired by the stripped-down sound of vocal and drum tracks. The first record from the duo was the EP Wild Things.
In 1982, the British press greeted the Siouxsie and the Banshees' album A Kiss in the Dreamhouse enthusiastically.[36] Richard Cook in the NME finished his review with "I promise. This music will take your breath away."[37]
In 1983, Siouxsie went to Hawaii to record the Creatures' first album Feast, which included the hit single "Miss the Girl". Later that year, Siouxsie and Budgie released "Right Now", a song from Mel Tormé's repertoire that the Creatures re-orchestrated with brass arrangements.[38] Then with the Banshees (including guitarist Robert Smith of The Cure), she covered The Beatles' "Dear Prudence", reaching number 3 on the UK Singles Chart.[39] Two albums followed with Smith: Nocturne, recorded live in London in 1983, and 1984's Hyæna. 1986's Tinderbox and the 1987 covers album Through the Looking Glass both reached the top 15 in the UK.[40]
In 1988, the single "Peek-a-Boo" marked a musical departure from her previous work, anticipating hip hop-inspired rock with the use of samples. The song was praised by the NME as "oriental marching band hip hop with farting horns and catchy accordion"[41] and hailed by the Melody Maker as "a brightly unexpected mixture of black steel and pop disturbance."[42] The Peepshow album was considered by critics to be the Banshees' most successful album in years.[43]
Siouxsie then temporarily reformed the Creatures with Budgie and went to Spain to record Boomerang. In his review, Simon Reynolds said that it was her "most inventive and invigorated music since A Kiss in the Dreamhouse".[44] In 2012, one of the songs, the jazzy "You!" was used by two dancers in the US TV show So You Think You Can Dance.[45]
On 1991's dance-oriented "Kiss Them for Me" single, Siouxsie and the Banshees used South Asian instrumentation, which had become popular in the UK club scene with the growth of bhangra.[46][47] Indian tabla player Talvin Singh (who was later Björk's percussionist on her 1993's Debut album) took part in the session and provided vocals for the bridge. With Kiss Them for Me, the Banshees scored a hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 peaking at number 23.[48] After the release of Superstition which received enthusiastic reviews,[49] the group co-headlined the first Lollapalooza tour, further increasing their American following.
In 1992, the Banshees recorded the single "Face to Face" and began a hiatus of a few years. The last Banshees studio album, The Rapture, was released in 1995. After the accompanying tour, the Banshees announced their split during a press conference called "20 Minutes Into 20 Years".[50]
Suede invited her to a benefit concert for the Red Hot Organization. With guitarist Bernard Butler, she delivered a version of Lou Reed's "Caroline Says". Spin reviewed it as "haughty and stately".[51]
Morrissey, ex-lead singer of The Smiths, recorded a duet with Siouxsie in 1994. They both sang on the single "Interlude", a track that was initially performed by Timi Yuro, a female torch singer of the 1960s. "Interlude" was released under the banner of "Morrissey and Siouxsie".
In 1995, she released the song "The Lighthouse" on French producer Hector Zazou's album Chansons des mers froides which translates to Songs from the Cold Seas. Siouxsie and Zazou adapted the poem "Flannan Isle" by English poet Wilfred Wilson Gibson.
In February 1998, former Velvet Underground member John Cale invited her to a festival called "With a Little Help From My Friends" at the Paradiso in Amsterdam. The concert was shown on Dutch national television and featured an unreleased Siouxsie composition, "Murdering Mouth",[3] sung as a duet with Cale. The collaboration between the two artists worked so well that they decided to tour the US from July until August, performing "Murdering Mouth" and Cale's "Gun" together in the encores.
The following year, Siouxsie and Budgie released the first Creatures album since the split of the Banshees. Anima Animus was described by The Times as "hypnotic and inventive".[52] Also in 1999, Siouxsie collaborated with Marc Almond on the track "Threat of Love."
In 2002, she was rated in the 10 best female rock artists by Q.[53] That same year, Universal released The Best of Siouxsie and the Banshees as the first reissue of her back catalogue.
In 2003, Siouxsie was featured on the track "Cish Cash" by Basement Jaxx. The album Kish Kash won Best Electronic/Dance Album at the Grammy Awards.[54] Siouxsie then released the last Creatures album, Hai! which was in part recorded in Japan. Peter Wratts wrote in Time Out: "Her voice is the dominant instrument here, snaking and curling around the bouncing drumming backdrop, elegiac and inhuman as she chants, purrs and whispers her way around the album." He termed the record a "spine-tingling achievement."[55]
In 2004, she toured for the first time as a solo act combining Banshees and Creatures songs. A live DVD called Dreamshow was recorded at the last London concert, in which she was accompanied by the Millennia Ensemble. Released in August 2005, this DVD reached the No. 1 position in the UK music DVD charts.[56]
Her first solo album Mantaray was released in September 2007. Pitchfork wrote, "She really is pop", before finishing the review by declaring, "It's a success."[57] Mojo stated: "a thirst for sonic adventure radiates from each track".[58]
In 2008, Siouxsie performed vocals for the track "Careless Love" on The Edge of Love soundtrack by composer Angelo Badalamenti, a frequent collaborator with director David Lynch. She performed another Badalamenti number, "Who Will Take My Dreams Away", at the annual edition of the World Soundtrack Awards.[59]
After a year of touring, the singer played the last show of her tour in London in September 2008. A live DVD of this performance, Finale: The Last Mantaray and More Show, was released in 2009.
In October 2011, Siouxsie announced that there was "plenty more new material to come",[11] including a new album.[60]
In June 2013 after a hiatus of five years, Siouxsie performed two nights at the Royal Festival Hall in London during Yoko Ono's Meltdown festival. She performed 1980's Kaleidoscope album in its entirety, along with other works from her back catalogue: her performance was hailed by the press.[61] She also appeared at Ono's Double Fantasy concert, to sing the final song "Walking on Thin Ice".[62]
Her voice is, in its own right, the common thread through all of it. There is no one who sings like that. And I think there are a lot of people who were influenced by it, but even if you try and sing like her, you can't do that. You can't throw your voice like that. You can't throw harmony like that. That is a very distinct voice. Her technique is a thread between the really far-out stuff and opera and pop music. It's distinct. It's all her own.
Siouxsie's influence on modern music has been considerable.[4][18] Siouxsie had a strong impact on two trip-hop acts. Tricky covered 1983's proto trip-hop "Tattoo" to open his second album Nearly God[64] and Massive Attack sampled "Metal Postcard" on their song "Superpredators (Metal Postcard)" for the soundtrack to the film The Jackal.[65]
Other acts have also covered Siouxsie's songs. Jeff Buckley, who took inspiration from various female singers, performed "Killing Time", composed by Siouxsie and Budgie in 1989 for the Creatures album Boomerang.[66] Buckley first sang it in 1992 on WFMU.[5] LCD Soundsystem recorded a cover of "Slowdive" for the B-side of "Disco Infiltrator". Their version was also released on Introns.[67] Santigold based one of her tracks, "My Superman", on the music of Banshees song "Red Light".[68] In 2003, The Beta Band sampled "Painted Bird" and changed the title to "Liquid Bird" on their Heroes to Zeros album.[69] Red Hot Chili Peppers performed "Christine" at the V2001 festival and introduced it to their British audience as "your national anthem".[70] Indie rock songwriter Jeremy Jay covered "Lunar Camel" on his debut Airwalker EP. Indie folk group DeVotchKa covered the ballad "The Last Beat of My Heart" on the suggestion of Arcade Fire singer Win Butler; it was released on the Curse Your Little Heart EP.[71]
Morrissey, previously of The Smiths said that "Siouxsie and the Banshees were excellent. They were one of the great groups of the late 70s, early 80s".[72] In 1995, discussing modern bands, he also stated: "None of them are as good as Siouxsie and the Banshees at full pelt. That's not dusty nostalgia, that's fact."[73] Another ex-member of The Smiths, Johnny Marr, mentioned that he rated guitarist John McGeoch for his work on Siouxsie's single "Spellbound". Marr qualified it as "clever" with "really good picky thing going on which is very un-rock'n'roll."[74] Radiohead also cited McGeoch-era Siouxsie records when mentioning the recording of "There There"[75] Their singer Thom Yorke said: "the band that really changed my life was R.E.M. and Siouxsie and the Banshees ...". "My favourite show I ever saw then was Siouxsie and she was absolutely amazing. ... She's totally in command of the whole audience".[76] Yorke added that she "made an especially big impression in concert, she was really sexy but absolutely terrifying."[77] Sonic Youth's singer and guitarist, Thurston Moore, named "Hong Kong Garden" as one of his all time 25 favourite songs.[78]
Siouxsie has influenced other bands ranging from contemporaries U2[79] and The Cure[80] to later acts like The Jesus and Mary Chain,[81] Jane's Addiction[82] and TV on the Radio.[83] U2 Frontman Bono named her as an influence in the band's 2006 autobiography U2 by U2. He was inspired by her way of singing.[79] With his band, he selected "Christine" for a compilation made for Mojo's readers.[84] U2 guitarist The Edge also was the presenter of an award given to Siouxsie at a Mojo ceremony in 2005.[85][86] The Cure's Robert Smith declared in 2003: "Siouxsie and The Banshees and Wire were the two bands I really admired. They meant something."[80] He also pinpointed what the Join Hands tour brought him musically: "On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with The Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like The Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello, the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing."[87] For Smith's record The Head on the Door in 1985, he stated: "It reminds me of the Kaleidoscope album, the idea of having lots of different sounding things, different colours".[88] Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction once made a parallel between his band and the Banshees: "There are so many similar threads: melody, use of sound, attitude, sex appeal. I always saw Jane's Addiction as the masculine Siouxsie and the Banshees."[82] From a younger generation, Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio hailed the poppiest Siouxsie songs, citing their arrangements: "I've always tried to make a song that begins like "Kiss Them for Me". I think songs like "I Was a Lover" or "Wash the Day Away" came from that element of surprise mode where all of a sudden this giant drum comes in and you're like, what the fuck?! That record was the first one where I was like, okay, even my friends're going to fall for this. I feel like that transition into that record was a relief for me. Really beautiful music was always considered too weird by the normal kids and that was the first example where I thought, we've got them, they're hooked! I watched people dance to that song, people who had never heard of any of the music that I listened to, they heard that music in a club and went crazy."[83] Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode said about Siouxsie: "She always sounds exciting. She sings with a lot of sex–that's what I like".[89]
Siouxsie has been hailed by many female singers. PJ Harvey selected Anima Animus album by Siouxsie's second band The Creatures, in her top 10 favourite albums of 1999.[90] Sinéad O'Connor said that when she started, Siouxsie was one of her favourite singers.[91] Tracey Thorn of Everything But The Girl wrote in her autobiography that Siouxsie was one of her "heroines".[92] Thorn paid homage to Siouxsie in the lyrics of her 2007's song "Hands Up To The Ceiling".[93] Garbage singer Shirley Manson cited her as an influence: "I learned how to sing listening to The Scream and Kaleidoscope."[94] Manson also mentioned that Siouxsie embodied everything she wanted to be as a young woman.[95] Gossip cited her as one of their influences for their 2009's Music For Men.[96] Ana Matronic of Scissor Sisters named Siouxsie as a source of inspiration and the Banshees as her favourite band.[97] Siouxsie was also name-checked by Kim Deal.[98] Courtney Love cited her positively while talking about the band Savages : "They are amazing. ... It's kind of very Siouxsie Sioux."[99]
I keep a Rolodex of the women that vocally inspire me. There aren't that many, but she's definitely one of them. I remember one of the first times I heard "Red Light" it was at a party, and I remember going up to the DJ and being like, "Who's this?". It was that good. I kind of stopped and was like ... wow. There's not a tremendous amount of women who are bold and forward thinking as artists. I feel like her music, at the time especially, was pretty unique in the way that it sort of matched her style. The freedom of experimenting with this dark place that doesn't have a place often in modern music.[68]
In an interview with The Sunday Times in August 2007, she announced that she and Budgie had divorced.[101] In an interview with The Independent, she said, "I've never particularly said I'm hetero or I'm a lesbian. I know there are people who are definitely one way, but not really me. I suppose if I am attracted to men then they usually have more feminine qualities."[102]

Siouxsie and the Banshees in 1979, left to right: Kenny Morris, Siouxsie Sioux, John McKay and Steven Severin
Siouxsie and the Banshees were an English rock band formed in London in 1976 by vocalist Siouxsie Sioux and bass guitarist Steven Severin. Initially associated with the English punk rock scene, the band rapidly evolved to create "a form of post-punk discord full of daring rhythmic and sonic experimentation".[1] The Times cited Siouxsie and the Banshees as "one of the most audacious and uncompromising musical adventurers of the post-punk era."[1]
Their music combined elements of pop and avant-garde.[2] The Banshees also became inspirational in the creation of the gothic rock genre. They disbanded in 1996, with Siouxsie and drummer Budgie continuing to record music as The Creatures, a second band they had formed in the early 1980s. In 2004, Siouxsie began a solo career.
Siouxsie Sioux and Steven Severin met at a Roxy Music concert in September 1975, at a time when glam rock had faded and there was nothing new coming through with which they could identify.[3] From February 1976, Siouxsie, Severin and some friends began to follow an unsigned band, the Sex Pistols.[4] Journalist Caroline Coon dubbed them the "Bromley Contingent", as most of them came from the Bromley region of Kent, a label Severin came to despise. "There was no such thing, it was just a bunch of people drawn together by the way they felt and they looked."[4] They were all inspired by the Sex Pistols – from watching them, they realized that anyone could do it.[5] When they learned that one of the bands scheduled to play the 100 Club Punk Festival, organized by Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, pulled out from the bill at the last minute, Siouxsie suggested that she and Severin play, even though they had no band name or additional members.[6] Two days later, the pair appeared at the festival held in London on 20 September 1976. With two borrowed musicians at their side, Marco Pirroni on guitars and John Simon Ritchie (already commonly known as Sid Vicious) on drums, their set consisted of a 20-minute improvisation based on "The Lord's Prayer".[7]
While the band intended to split up after the gig, they were asked to play again. Two months later, Siouxsie and Severin recruited drummer Kenny Morris and guitarist Peter Fenton.[8] After playing several gigs in early 1977, the band realized that Fenton did not fit in because he was "a real rock guitarist". John McKay finally took his seat in July.[9]
While the band sold out venues in London in early 1978,[10] they still had problems getting the right recording contract that could give them "complete artistic control".[11] Polydor finally offered this guarantee and signed them in June. Their first single, "Hong Kong Garden", featuring a xylophone motif, reached the Top Ten in the UK shortly after. In its review, the NME hailed it as "a bright, vivid narrative, something like snapshots from the window of a speeding Japanese train, power charged by the most original, intoxicating guitar playing I heard in a long, long time."[12]
The band released their debut album, The Scream, in November 1978. Nick Kent of NME said of the record: "the band sounds like some unique hybrid of the Velvet Underground mated with much of the ingenuity of Tago Mago-era Can, if any parallel can be drawn." At the end of the article, he added this remark: "Certainly, the traditional three-piece sound has never been used in a more unorthodox fashion with such stunning results."[13]
The Banshees' second album, Join Hands, was released in 1979 and included a version of "The Lord's Prayer". In Melody Maker, Jon Savage described "Poppy Day" as "a short, powerful evocation of the Great War graveyards"[14] and Record Mirror described the whole record as "a dangerous and volatile work".[15] The Banshees embarked on a major tour to promote the album. A few dates into the tour in September, Morris and McKay left an in-store signing after an argument and quit the band.[16] In need of replacements to fulfil tour dates, the Banshees' manager called drummer Budgie, formerly with The Slits, and asked him to audition. Budgie was hired, but Siouxsie and Severin had no success auditioning guitarists.[17] Robert Smith of The Cure offered his services in case they couldn't find a guitarist (his group were already the support band on the tour), so the band held him to it after seeing too many "rock virtuosos".[18] The tour resumed in September and after the last concert, Smith returned to The Cure.[19]
Drummer Budgie became a permanent member and the band entered the studios to record the single "Happy House" with guitarist John McGeoch, formerly of Magazine. Their third album, Kaleidoscope, released in 1980, saw the Banshees exploring new musical territories with the use of other instruments like synthesizers, sitars and drum machines. The group initially had a concept of making each song sound completely different, without regard to whether or not the material could be performed in concert.[20] Melody Maker described the result as "a kaleidoscope of sound and imagery, new forms, and content, flashing before our eyes."[21] Kaleidoscope was a commercial success, peaking at number 5 in the UK album chart. This lineup, featuring McGeoch on guitar, toured the United States for the first time in support of the album, playing their first shows in New York City in November 1980.[22]
For Juju (1981), the band had a different approach and practised the songs in concert first before recording them.[23] Juju, according to Severin, became an unintentional concept album that "drew on darker elements". Sounds hailed it as "intriguing, intense, brooding and powerfully atmospheric."[24] The album later peaked at number 7 in the UK album charts and became one of their biggest sellers.[25] McGeoch's guitars contribution on Juju would be later named and praised by Johnny Marr of The Smiths.[26][27]
During the 1981 accompanying tour, Siouxsie and Budgie secretly became a couple.[28] At the same time, they also began a side project called The Creatures, releasing their first EP, Wild Things.
The Banshees followed in 1982 with A Kiss in the Dreamhouse. The record, featuring strings on several numbers, was an intentional contrast to their previous work, with Severin later describing it as a "sexy album".[29] The British press greeted it enthusiastically.[30][31] Richard Cook in the NME finished his review with this sentence: "I promise...this music will take your breath away."[32] At that time, McGeoch was struggling with alcohol problems, and was hospitalized on his return to a promotional trip from Madrid. The band fired him shortly thereafter.[33] Severin asked Robert Smith to take over guitarist duties again; Smith accepted and rejoined the group in November 1982.[34]
During 1983, the band members worked on several side projects; Siouxsie and Budgie composed the first Creatures album, Feast, while Severin and Smith recorded as The Glove. Smith then insisted on documenting his time with the Banshees, so the group released a cover version of The Beatles' "Dear Prudence" in September 1983; it became their biggest hit, reaching number 3 on the UK Singles Chart.[35] They also captured a live album, Nocturne, and completed their sixth studio album, Hyæna.[36] Shortly before its release in May 1984, Smith left the group, citing health issues due to an overloaded schedule, being in two bands at once.[37]
Ex-Clock DVA guitarist John Valentine Carruthers replaced him. The Banshees then reworked four numbers of their repertoire with a section of strings for their The Thorn EP. The NME praised the project at its release: "The power of a classical orchestra is the perfect foil for the band's grindingly insistent sounds."[38] The new Banshees lineup spent much of 1985 working on their new record, Tinderbox. The group finished the song "Cities in Dust" before the album, so they rushed its release as a single prior to their longest tour of the UK.[39] Tinderbox was finally released in April 1986. Sounds magazine noted: "Tinderbox is a refreshing slant on the Banshees' disturbing perspective and restores their vivid shades to pop's pale palette."[40] Due to the length of time spent working on Tinderbox, the group desired spontaneity and decided to record an album of cover songs, Through the Looking Glass, in 1987.[41] Mojo magazine later praised their version of "Strange Fruit".[42][43] After the album's release, the band realized Carruthers was not fitting in anymore and decided to work on new material as a trio.[44]
Following a lengthy break, the band recruited keyboard player Martin McCarrick and the ex-Specimen guitarist Jon Klein. The quintet recorded Peepshow in 1988, with non-traditional rock instrumentation including cello and accordion. Q magazine praised the album in its five-star review: "Peepshow takes place in some distorted fairground of the mind where weird and wonderful shapes loom."[45] The first single, "Peek-a-Boo" was seen by critics as a "brave move" with horns and dance elements.[46] Sounds wrote: "The snare gets slapped, Siouxsie's voice meanders all around your head and it all comes magically together".[46] "Peek-a-Boo" was their first real breakthrough in the United States.[47] After a tour to promote the album, the band decided to take a break, with Siouxsie and Budgie recording a new Creatures album, Boomerang and Severin and McCarrick working on material together.[48]
In 1991, the Banshees returned with the single "Kiss Them for Me", mixing strings over a dance rhythm laced with exotica. The group collaborated with a yet-unknown Asian Tabla player Talvin Singh, who also sang during the bridge. The single received glowing reviews[49] and later peaked in the Billboard Hot 100 at number 23, allowing them to reach a new audience.[47] The album Superstition followed shortly afterwards and the group toured the US as second headliners of the inaugural Lollapalooza tour. The following year, the Banshees were asked to compose "Face to Face" as a single for the film Batman Returns.[50]
In 1993, the Banshees recorded new songs based on strings arrangements, but quickly stopped the sessions to play festivals abroad. On their return home, they hired former Velvet Underground member John Cale to produce the rest of the record.[51] At its release, 1995's The Rapture was described by Melody Maker as "a fascinating, transcontinental journey through danger and exotica."[52] A few weeks after its release, Polydor dropped the band from its roster[53] and Klein was replaced on the band's last tour in 1995 by ex-Psychedelic Furs guitarist Knox Chandler. In April 1996, the band finally called it a day after 20 years spent together.[54] Siouxsie and Budgie announced that they would carry on recording as The Creatures. In 1999, they released the album Anima Animus to critical acclaim.[55]
In 2002, Universal Music inaugurated the band's remastered back catalogue by releasing The Best of Siouxsie and the Banshees. In April, Siouxsie, Severin, Budgie and Chandler reunited briefly for the Seven Year Itch tour, which spawned the Seven Year Itch live album and DVD in 2003.
The year after, Downside Up, a box-set that collected all of the band's B-sides and The Thorn EP, was released. The Times wrote in its review: "for here is a group that never filled B-sides with inferior, throwaway tracks. Rather they saw them as an outlet for some of their most radical and challenging work."[56]
In 2006, the band's first four records were remastered and compiled with previously unreleased bonus tracks. Several recordings made for the John Peel radio show from 1978 to 1986 were also put together on Voices on the Air: The Peel Sessions. Allmusic described the first session as "a fiery statement of intent" and qualified the other performances as "excellent".[57]
The second batch of remasters, concerning the 1982–1986 era, came out in April 2009. It included four other re-issues (including their highly regarded A Kiss in the Dreamhouse from 1982).[30][32] The At the BBC box set, containing a DVD with all of the band's UK live television performances and three CDs with in-concert recordings, was also released in June of the same year.
In April 2014, their debut single "Hong Kong Garden" will be reissued on double seven-inch vinyl. The gatefold sleeve will contain both an eight-page booklet overseen by Siouxsie and Severin, and a second disc featuring a 2006's string reworking of the song. It was also announced that this would be part of a three year plan with Universal, to release several box sets with archive material.[58]
The Banshees had a strong effect on two main trip hop acts.[59][60] Tricky covered "Tattoo" to open his second album, Nearly God:[61] the 1983's proto trip-hop version of that song helped Tricky in the creation of his style.[59] Another group of Bristol, Massive Attack, sampled "Metal Postcard" on the song "Superpredators", recorded prior to their Mezzanine album.[62] The Italian Eurodance group Cappella built their hit song U Got 2 Know on the riff from "Happy House." [63]
The group have been cited by their peers. Morrissey said that "Siouxsie and the Banshees were excellent". "They were one of the great groups of the late 70s, early 80s".[64] He also said in 1994, "If you study modern groups, those who gain press coverage and chart action, none of them are as good as Siouxsie and the Banshees at full pelt. That's not dusty nostalgia, that's fact."[65] Another ex-member of The Smiths, Johnny Marr, mentioned his liking for Banshees guitarist John McGeoch and his composition on "Spellbound". Marr qualified it as "clever" with "really good picky thing going on which is very un-rock'n'roll."[66] U2 cited Siouxsie and the Banshees as a major influence[67] and selected "Christine" for a Mojo compilation.[68] The Edge was the presenter of an award given to Siouxsie at the Mojo ceremony in 2005.[69][70] Guitarist Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction once made a parallel between his band and the Banshees: "There are so many similar threads: melody, use of sound, attitude, sex-appeal. I always saw Jane's Addiction as the masculine Siouxsie and the Banshees."[71] The Cure leader Robert Smith declared in 2003: "Siouxsie and the Banshees and Wire were the two bands I really admired. They meant something."[72] He also pinpointed what the 1979 Join Hands tour brought him musically. "On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with The Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like the Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello, the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing."[73] Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode hailed the single "Candyman" at its release: "This is a great Banshees record[...], I like their sound".[74] Singer and guitarist Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, cited "Hong Kong Garden" in his top 25 all time favourite songs.[75] Songwriter Kevin Shields mentionned them in his early influences.[76]
The Banshees have been hailed by other acts. Radiohead cited John McGeoch-era Siouxsie records when mentioning the recording of the song "There There".[77][78] Jim Reid of The Jesus and Mary Chain selected "Jigsaw Feeling" from The Scream amongst his favourite songs.[79] Jeff Buckley, who took inspiration in several female voices, covered "Killing Time" on various occasions.[80][81] Suede's singer Brett Anderson named Juju as one of his favourite records in 2011[82] and also cited three other albums by the band on his website, The Scream, Kaleidoscope and Tinderbox.[83] Red Hot Chili Peppers performed "Christine" in concert[84] and their guitarist John Frusciante cited the Banshees in interviews.[85] Garbage singer Shirley Manson wrote in the foreword to Paytress' Banshees biography, "I learned how to sing listening to The Scream and Kaleidoscope. Today, I can see and hear the Banshees' influence all over the place."[86][87] Siouxsie has also been praised by various female singers including PJ Harvey[88] and Ana Matronic of Scissor Sisters.[89] PJ Harvey selected Siouxsie's album Anima Animus in her top ten albums of year 1999.[88]
The Banshees continue to influence younger musicians. Singer James Murphy was marked by certain Banshees albums during his childhood.[90] His band LCD Soundsystem covered "Slowdive" as a B-side to the single "Disco Infiltrator". The Beta Band sampled "Painted Bird" on their track "Liquid Bird" from the Heroes to Zeros album.[91] TV on the Radio said they have always tried to make a song that begins like "Kiss Them for Me" where all of a sudden, there's an "element of surprise" with "a giant drum coming in".[92] Electronica singer Santigold based one of her songs on the music of "Red Light". "'My Superman' is an interpolation of 'Red Light,'" she explained.[93] Lo-fi songwriter Jeremy Jay covered "Lunar Camel" on his Airwalker EP and he cited the band amongst his main influences.[94] Indie folk group DeVotchKa covered the ballad "The Last Beat of My Heart" on the suggestion of Arcade Fire singer Win Butler; it was released on the Curse Your Little Heart EP.[95] Gossip named the Banshees as one of their major influences during the promotion of their single "Heavy Cross".[96] British indie band Bloc Party took inspiration from "Peek-a-Boo" and their singer Kele Okereke stated about that Banshees' single: "it sounded like nothing else on this planet. This is just a pop song that they put out in the middle of their career that nobody knows about, but to me it sounded like the most current but most futuristic bit of guitar-pop music I've heard."[97] The Weeknd sampled different parts of "Happy House" for his song "House of Balloons", and also used the chorus of the initial version.[98]

       If Johnny Rotten was the father of punk, then Siouxsie Sioux was its mother. One of the seminal bands of the punk era that have survived whilst contemporaries like The Clash and The Sex Pistols have ceased to record years ago, Siouxsie & The Banshees tell their story on their own terms. From the band's unsteady birth through to their creative high with 1991's "Superstition" album, "Siouxsie & The Banshees" is the complete authorized story told in each member's own words. Despite its official tag, no punches are pulled in discussions about the band's split in 1996, the years of in-fighting and arguments and the reasons behind their recent reunion to launch their "Best Of" album. Featuring photographs and memorabilia from Siouxsie and co's personal collections, the book should appeal to all music lovers and to anyone who was there in 1976.
If you are a publisher or author and hold the digital rights to a book, you can sell a digital version of it in our Kindle Store.
  From the suburbs they came, as followers of the Sex Pistols not even Siouxsie or Severin could have guessed that their "ragdoll dance" would have lasted nearly 20 years.The Siouxsie & The Banshees biography is a must read for anyone who followed the band,a band that reckoned they'd only last one gig and go off into obscurity.If you're looking for a book of photos to titillate, forget it, this book is more about hard facts than glossy pictures!It truely follows the highs & lows of a band who should never have been labled Punk & most certainly were never Goth'.From the headines of the early days to the rangles that helped end it all.The book is inspirational in that Siouxsie & Severin had never picked up a mic' or bass up until that fateful night in the 100 club,yet they progressed,proved and outlived most bands of their time.And as a women Siouxsie most certainly proved that you can succeed in a male orientated enviornment.This is the book that I've waited 20 years for & the wait was worth it.Prepare to be amazed and even shocked as you enter the world that was Siouxsie and the Banshees.
  long, long awaited, this book is clearly the definitive guide to THE band that provided the sound-track for my youth (and beyond!).It's fascinating to see how songs that are really age-old friends came into being, and also what the band were thinking of when they recorded them.Die-hard fans will love every page, as I did, although I think there's a lot there for anyone less directly involved too. Just how much the Banshees were at the centre of new music is laid bare, quite possibly for the first time. Their creative shifts (one minute 'punk', then the inventors of 'goth', then experimenting with 'ethereal' ...) also benefit from being explained in context.This book made me, at least, very very happy.
  A big fan of the Banshees but a latecomer to their music (first heard around '93) I picked this up to catch up on the back story. Though i was initially disappointed to find that the book is compiled of cut up interviews with the band members and other interested parties, it soon became apparent that this was the best way to tell this story: the voices of the interviewees came through strongly, and were very entratining. The interviews themselves were in depth, well executed, and edited in such a way as to keep the momentum of the story going.Thoroughly recommended as a great read for either Banshees fans or those interested in the history of rock music.
  Ok so I had a fixation with Siouxsie. Always did and proud of it. However this is about Souxsie AND the Banshees which is exactly how it should be and not just a story of Siouxsie Sioux.Based on interviews with most of the major characters in the creation & development of the Banshees this is a clear and informative story. It does not appear that there has been too much censure by each member; disagreements (for example between Sioux & Severin) are apparent at certain points in the history and come out as gripping narrative in the way the interviews have been cut together, so you feel you are getting a true picture of what the Banshees were like.If you have ever read John Lydon's autobiog there are references to the Bromley Contingent (which I have since learned was a term disliked by Sioux & Stephen) and comments from Sioux etc in there too. What strikes me more than anything is how so many of the great British bands of that era were intertwined/friends/hung out/grew up together during the Punk/Goth/Althernative/pop era's, Marc Almond, Robert Smith (of course), Malcom Mc.., Richard Jobson, Patricia Morrison ... the list goes on.Gripping book. Read it in one shot somewhere over the Atlantic. Read this, dig your copy of Nocturne out of the CD collection and relive your youth...
  A terrific behind-the-scenes look at one of the most underratedbands around. This book was well researched/compiled and as such renders a gritty look at... Read more
  As a huge fan of Siouxsie and the Banshees I bought this book with delight and was engrossed all the way through. Read more

  This is one book  I just can't put down. I fell into the Banshees quite by accident  in 1984, having discovered them via their connections to the Cure's Robert Smith. Hyaena was my first purchase, and although I felt like something of a "Johnny-Come Lately" fan I have followed them ever since. This great book tells the warts and all story of the band, from their chaotic, what-a-shambles beginings through their many trials and tribulations, to their ultimate break-up and unfortunate reunion. For fans this is a MUST. If, like me, you have always assumed that Sioux's last name is Dallion, as is it spelled in many alternative rock source guide books, then you will learn that it's actually Ballion.

  I bought this book and couldn't put it down!  This is one of the best books out there about Siouxsie and the Banshees!  These are interviews with Siouxsie along with members of the band and other important figures.  They (Siouxsie and others) tell the stories about the band's history, the songs/albums, etc.  If you're a Siouxsie fan - you have to get this book!  Another good book for a Siouxsie fan (and its hard to get) is Ray Stevenson's Siouxsie and the Banshees Photo Book.  Get this book and the Photo book!
  I just finished this and I enjoyed it immensely.  Yes, there could have been more pictures, or color pictures, but the "dish" was terrific.  Written in interview snippets with band members, associates and friends, you get a clear picture of what was actually going on with the band and behind the scenes while we were all busily worshiping Siouxsie.I learned plenty from things I must have missed reading up on since first stumbling upon the Arabian Knights video around 1981, up to and including their sad break up in 1995...Who knew that behind Robert Smith's back he was unaffectionately referred to as "Fat Bob," or that PEEPSHOW was fueled most specifically by cocaine, that FEAST was hammered out in two weeks, that Siouxsie ruled the band with an iron fist (well, you HAD to know that). I still worship the music, but now I appreciate the humans who created it, whiny and childish as they seemed at times.It's a great read, I love Siouxsie's occasional foul mouth and the fact that she had the audacity to have been photographed for the cover of the book in a Burberry blouse.  And you'll have fun at the end of the book highlighting all the gigs you actually saw and horrified at how many you allowed yourself to miss.  (Discography and extensive index included)

  I have a casual interest in Siouxsie and the Banshees and recently decided to add their 'best of' to my CD collection. On a whim I decided to get this biography to find out the stories behind some excellent songs. I must say how impressed I was with what I learned about the band and the personalities within. I can sum it all up by saying it's a story of chance, hard work, an over-whelming desire to be different, drinking, a seemingly never ending succession of guitar players, more drinking, some drugs, persistance and artistic integrity. With more drinking! Starting from a point of not even knowing how to play their instruments right through to crafting some song arrangements which are quite exquisite, Siouxsie and the crew really made their mark. This book delivers a blunt and to-the-point account of how they managed it. A very interesting read for anyone whose single buying years started in the late 70s and who has an interest in the late punk/new wave/pop genre.
  As a long time fan, some of this was old news, but there were lots of interesting tidbits I knew nothing about. My biggest complaint is the lack of photos, and those featured here are basic black and white ones most fans have seen (if you have Ray Stevenson's Banshee photo book you are sure to recognize them).  A band as colorful as the Banshees should compile quite a treat for the eye. Maybe they will do that for the next book!  I hope!
  First, I have to say I highly recommend this book to all Siouxsie fans as you're bound to find several interesting tidbits about the band, the songs, tours, etc.  However, be warned - this is not all new material.  Paytress basically picked "the best of the best" from prior interviews and arranged the snippets so that it appears that the band all sat down together and told their story to him.  If you have been a long time fan and followed them closely over the years, chances are you've already read most of what's in the book.  Most of us already know about their infamous 100 Club debut, their ever-changing guitarist line-up, and how some of their more famous recordings such as Peepshow came to be and it's all rehashed here.  What I found most fascinating were the parts of the book detailing the later years of The Banshees leading to their breakup and details surrounding their various side projects such as The Creatures and Sioux's duet with Morrissey.  Additionally, I had no idea how much turmoil this band endured in terms of finances, poor management, etc., and it was amazing how they continued to plow through it all.  All in all, it is a decent chronicle of one of the most under-appreciated bands of our time and worth the read even if some parts will be old news.
      This book has been around the world with me, and I read it about once per year. I like non-fiction, and it is possibly my favorite book.
      While I found this interesting since I am a fan of the band, I can't imagine it being very interesting at all to anyone who isn't. I found it to be a bit routine and clinical.
      I have loved Siouxsie and the Banshees since discovering them in high school, so of course I was eager to read this book when I heard it was coming out.
      This is a great book because it has all the viewpoints of all the players in the band for a span of about 25 years.
      The author of this bio does a great thing. He shuts his f#@king mouth and lets the band do the talking. The book really gives an insight into the band that I never had.
      Siouxsie and the Banshees tells you like it is. Period. They talk about everything from their childhood, drugs, alcohol, traumatic experiences, etc in such vivid detail that you...
      Rock biogs are a motley lot, and I think I make a good benchmark reviewer for this as I like a lot of the Banshees early stuff, but always got the impression Siouxsie was a bit of...
      I was fearful that this Book, even though "Authorised" would have Minimal Participation from the Boys & Siousxie. I am Proud to Be WRONG!

One of the most influential British females of the rock era was born Susan Janet Dallion in London, England, on May 27, 1957. The music of this pioneering punk princess married gothic tones to world rhythms…
                    One of the most influential British females of the rock era was born Susan Janet Dallion in London, England, on May 27, 1957. The music of this pioneering punk princess married gothic tones to world rhythms within a chilly new romantic framework. At age 19, Siouxsie Sioux appeared at the 100 Club Punk Festival, singing the Bay City Rollers' "Young Love" and an elongated version of "The Lord's Prayer" (with bassist Steve Severin, future Ant guitarist Marco Pirroni, and Sid Vicious on drums). The immediately assembled band hurriedly named themselves for the gig -- Sioux christened such because she hated cowboys, with the band honoring Vincent Price in Cry of the Banshee. Sioux and Severin also ran with the notorious Bromley Contingent, a nasty clique among the first to follow the Sex Pistols. She verbally sparred with Bill Grundy before the Sex Pistols swore at him on the Today show. Following the broadcast, Sioux put together her own working band, with Severin, Pete Fenton on guitar, and Ken Morris playing drums. Sioux at first dabbled in Nazi imagery, highlighted by black makeup and peek-a-boo breasts. In 1977, John McKay replaced Fenton and Siouxsie and the Banshees recorded a John Peel session and supported Johnny Thunders on tour.                 
                    Signed to Polydor a year later, the group's first single, "Hong Kong Garden," reached the U.K. Top Ten. The following debut record, Scream, produced by future perfectionist Steve Lillywhite, was recorded in seven days, but set the standard against which all subsequent Banshee releases would be measured. In 1981, Juju hit the U.K. Top Ten, and Budgie (Peter Clarke) from Big in Japan and the Slits now played the skins permanently. Sioux and Budgie formed a percussion-crazed off-shoot called the Creatures. A cover of the Troggs' garage staple drives the Wild Things EP by the Creatures. The full-length Feat attempts Hawaiian and marimba. Back with the Banshees, Sioux and company covered "Dear Prudence" and snagged another U.K. smash, featured on 1984's Hyaena. The album's lyrics remained sour with cuts like "Bring Me the Head of a Preacher Man" and "Pointing Bone," but her singing reached surprisingly sublime plateaus (as on the haunting "Dazzle").                 
                    The music now courted a sophisticated gloss corresponding with Sioux's detached image of splendor. Her frigid sexuality and Brechtian aloofness created a vampiric dominatrix who struck a cord with the hip and the alienated. As the icy video age dragged on, soon anyone with a TV screen knew of Sioux. Moonlighting Cure mastermind Robert Smith, ex-Magazine member John McGeoch, and John Carruthers, formerly of Clock DVA, all played guitar through the band's extended commercial and artistic renaissance. At the dawn of the '90s, Sioux married Budgie, and the Banshees performed in the inaugural Lollapalooza tour. Siouxie and the Banshees still embraced many Eastern nuances, but configured all eccentricity into a complex commercial capacity. the Banshees even supplied sonics for Batman Returns.                 
Sioux now evolved into an unreachable Hollywood starlet. The long-delayed Rapture appeared to sellout accusations in 1996. With the Sex Pistols reuniting for purely monetary reasons, Siouxie and the Banshees folded in an effort to disappear with dignity. the Creatures became the primary focus of Sioux and Budgie. In addition to 1989's Boomerang, since the Banshees' demise, the Creatures released another EP, Eraser Cuts, the full-length Anima Animus, and a remix collection, Hybrids. Us Retrace, dropped in 2000, collects unrecorded Creatures' scraps. It wasn't until years later, however, that the iconic frontwoman finally released her solo full-length debut, Mantaray, which dropped in 2007.

Siouxsie Sioux (born Susan Janet Ballion; May 27, 1957) is an English singer-songwriter. She is best known to be the lead singer of the critically acclaimed rock band Siouxsie and the Banshees (1976–1996) and of its splinter group The Creatures (1981–2005). The Banshees produced eleven studio albums and a string of hit singles including "Hong Kong Garden", "Happy House", "Peek-a-Boo" and "Kiss Them for Me". With The Creatures, Siouxsie recorded four studio albums and the hit single "Right Now".
She has also sung with artists such as Morrissey[1] and John Cale.[2] In the middle of the 2000s, she began a solo career and released MantaRay in 2007.
Her music has been hailed by a variety of acts including Jeff Buckley,[4] Tricky,[5] Massive Attack,[6] PJ Harvey,[7] LCD Soundsystem[8] and TV on the Radio.[9]
Born Susan Janet Ballion at Guy's Hospital in Southwark, south east London, England. She is the youngest of three children and attended Mottingham Secondary Modern School for Girls in Bromley, Kent. Her mother was a bilingual secretary, her father was a laboratory technician who milked serum from venomous snakes in the Belgian Congo. Her father died due to cirrhosis of the liver caused by his alcoholism when Siouxsie was 14 years old. At the same age, she survived a life-threatening bout of ulcerative colitis, which she later said "completely demystified the body for me."[10]
During her adolescence, she was a self-described "loner," who enjoyed listening to the music of David Bowie, Lou Reed, Roxy Music, T.Rex, The Velvet Underground and The Stooges. It was during this period that she began frequenting the local gay discos. She became well known in the London punk rock scene for her glam, fetish and bondage attire, which were notable of punk fashion. She also later popularized the Gothic style of dress with her trademark feline-style eye makeup, deep red lipstick, spiky dyed-black hair, and black clothing.
In the mid-1970s, journalist Caroline Coon coined the term "Bromley Contingent" to describe a group of eccentric teenagers devoted to the Sex Pistols. Siouxsie was a member of the Contingent, along with fellow Banshees founder Steven Severin.
Siouxsie's first gig was with her group Suzie and the Banshees, as an unrehearsed fill-in at the 100 Club Punk Festival organized by Malcolm McLaren in September 1976. The group did not know or play any songs; they improvised as Siouxsie recited poems and prayers she had memorized. For Jon Savage, she was "unlike any female singer before or since, commanding yet aloof, entirely modern."[11] It opened a new era for women in music as Viv Albertine from The Slits later commented:
"Siouxsie just appeared fully made, fully in control, utterly confident. It totally blew me away. There she was doing something that I dared to dream but she took it and did it and it wiped the rest of the festival for me, that was it. I can't even remember everything else about it except that one performance."[12]
The same month, the Bromley Contingent followed the Sex Pistols to France, where Siouxsie was beaten up for wearing a black armband with a swastika on it. She claimed her intent was to shock the bourgeoisie, not to make a political statement.[13] She later wrote the songs "Metal Postcard (Mittageisen)" (in memory of the anti-Nazi artist John Heartfield) and the single "Israel".[14]
One of Siouxsie's first public appearances was with the Sex Pistols on Bill Grundy's television show in December 1976. In the course of Grundy's interview with the members of the Sex Pistols, the presenter flirted with her: in reaction, Pistols guitarist Steve Jones called him a "dirty bastard" and a "dirty fucker",[15] which created a media furore that had a major impact on the Pistols' subsequent career.
In 1977, she changed her stage name and extensively toured in England with her friend Steven Severin on bass guitar as Siouxsie and the Banshees. One year later, their first single, "Hong Kong Garden" with its glockenspiel motif, instantaneously reached the top 10 in the UK. It was pictured by critics as "a bright, vivid narrative, something like snapshots from the window of a speeding Japanese train, power charged by the most original, intoxicating guitar playing heard in a long, long time."[16]
Their first album, 1978's The Scream, was described by Nick Kent in the NME in the following terms [17]: "The band sounds like some unique hybrid of the Velvet Underground mated with much of the ingenuity of Tago Mago-era Can, if any parallel can be drawn." At the end of the article, he added this remark: "Certainly, the traditional three-piece sound has never been used in a more unorthodox fashion with such stunning results." The Scream was later hailed by the NME as one of the best debut album of all time with Patti Smith's Horses.[18] Join Hands followed in 1979.
The 1980 album Kaleidoscope marked a change of musical direction with the arrival of John McGeoch, considered "one of the most innovative and influential guitarists of the past thirty years".[19] The hit single "Happy House" was qualified as "great pop" with "liquid guitar"[20] and other songs like "Red Light" were layered with electronic sounds. Kaleidoscope widened her audience, reaching the top 5 in the UK charts. Juju followed in 1981, reaching number 7, including the singles "Spellbound" and "Arabian Knights" qualified as "pop marvels" by the Guardian.[21]
During the recording sessions, the singer decided to form a second act, The Creatures, with Banshees drummer Budgie, to record music more based on percussion. The first record of the duo was the EP Wild Things (EP).
In 1982, the British press greeted the Siouxsie and the Banshees' album A Kiss in the Dreamhouse enthusiastically.[22] Richard Cook in the NME finished his review with "I promise. This music will take your breath away." [23]
In 1983, Siouxsie went to Hawaii to record The Creatures' first album Feast, which included the hit-single "Miss the Girl". During the summer, Siouxsie and Budgie hit again the charts with "Right Now", a song of the Mel Tormé's repertoire : the Creatures re-orchestrated it with brass arrangements.[24] Then with the Banshees and guitarist Robert Smith of The Cure, she revisited The Beatles' "Dear Prudence", reaching number three on the UK Singles Chart.[25] Two other records followed with Smith: Nocturne, recorded live in London and Hyæna in 1984. 1986's Tinderbox and the 1987 covers album Through the Looking Glass both reached the top 15 in the UK.
In 1988, the single "Peek-a-Boo" marked a musical departure from her previous work: it anticipated hip hop-inspired rock with the use of samples. The song was praised by the NME as "oriental marching band hip hop with farting horns and catchy accordion"[26] and hailed by the Melody Maker as "a brightly unexpected mixture of black steel and pop disturbance."[27] The Peepshow album was considered by critics as her most successful album in years.[28]
Siouxsie then temporarily reformed the Creatures with Budgie and went to Spain to record Boomerang. In his review, Simon Reynolds said that it was her "most inventive and invigorated music since A Kiss in the Dreamhouse.".[29]
In 1991 with the "Kiss Them for Me" single, she used South Asian instrumentation which had become popular in the UK club scene due to the growth of bhangra. Tabla player Talvin Singh (future percussionist of Björk on her 1993's Debut album) took part in the sessions and also sang during the bridge. With Kiss Them for Me, the singer scored a hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 peaking at number 23.[30] After the release of Superstition that encountered enthusiastic reviews,[31] she co-headlined the first Lollapalooza tour further increasing her American following. In 1992, Siouxsie recorded the single "Face to Face" and marked a pause of a few years. She then released the last Banshees studio album The Rapture. After the accompanying tour, the Banshees announced their split during a press conference called "20 minutes into 20 years".[32]
Morrissey recorded a duet with her in 1994. They both sang on the single "Interlude", a track that was initially performed by Timi Yuro, a female torch singer of the 1960s.
In 1995, she released the song "The Lighthouse" on the French producer Hector Zazou's album Chansons des mers froides which translates to Songs from the Cold Seas. Siouxsie and Zazou adapted the poem "Flannan Isle" by English poet Wilfred Wilson Gibson.
In February 1998, former Velvet Underground member John Cale invited her at a festival called "With a Little Help From My Friends" that took place at the Paradiso in Amsterdam. The concert was shown on Dutch national television and featured an unreleased composition of Siouxsie, "Murdering Mouth" sung in duet with Cale.[33] The collaboration between the two artists worked so well that they later both decided to tour the USA during the summer, singing some songs together like Sioux's "Murdering Mouth" and Cale's "Gun".
The following year, Siouxsie and Budgie released the first Creatures album since the split of the Banshees. Anima Animus was described by The Times as "hypnotic and inventive".[34] The singer later made another collaboration, making this time a duet with Marc Almond on the track "Threat Of Love".
In 2002, she was rated the number seven female rock artist by Q magazine in 2002.[35] Universal put out shortly after The Best of Siouxsie and the Banshees as the first re-issue of her back-catalogue.
In 2003, she was asked to compose and sing the title track to Basement Jaxx's album Kish Kash: the record then received a prize at the Grammy Awards.[36] Shortly after, Siouxsie released the last Creatures album, Hai! which was in part recorded in Japan. Peter Wratts wrote in Time Out: "her voice is the dominant instrument here, snaking and curling around the bouncing drumming backdrop, elegiac and inhuman as she chants, purrs and whispers her way around the album" and it's a "spine-tingling achievement".[37]
One year later, she toured for the first time as a solo act combining Banshees and Creatures songs: a live DVD called Dreamshow recorded the last London concert of September 2004, performed with the Millennia Ensemble. Released in August 2005, this DVD reached the number one position in the UK music DVD charts.[38]
Her first solo album MantaRay was released on September 2007. Pitchfork Media wrote "She really is pop" before finishing the review by declaring "It's a success."[39] Mojo magazine stated "a thirst for sonic adventure radiates from each track".[40]
In 2008, Siouxsie took part in The Edge of Love soundtrack by composer Angelo Badalamenti, frequent collaborator with director David Lynch. She sang on the title "Careless Love". She later performed another Badalamenti number "Who Will Take My Dreams Away" at the annual edition of the World Soundtrack Awards.[41]
After a year of touring, the singer played the last show of her tour in London in September. A live DVD of this performance called Finale: The Last Mantaray And More Show was released in 2009.
 Her voice is, in its own right, the common thread through all of it. There is no one who sings like that. And I think there are a lot of people who were influenced by it, but even if you try and sing like her, you can’t do that. You can’t throw your voice like that. You can’t throw harmony like that. That is a very distinct voice. Her technique is a thread between the really far-out stuff and opera and pop music. It’s distinct. It’s all her own.
Siouxsie had a strong impact on two trip-hop acts. Tricky covered the 1983's pre-trip-hop "Tattoo" to open his second album Nearly God[43] and Massive Attack sampled "Metal Postcard" on their song "Superpredators (Metal Postcard)" for the soundtrack to the film The Jackal.[44]
Other acts also covered Siouxsie's songs. Jeff Buckley, who took inspiration in various female singers, performed live "Killing Time", composed by Siouxsie and Budgie in 1989 for the Creatures album Boomerang: Buckley first sang it in 1992 for radio WFMU.[45][46] LCD Soundsystem recorded a cover of "Slowdive" for the B-side of "Disco Infiltrator": their version was also released on Introns.[47] Santigold based one of her tracks on the music of "Red Light" : "'My Superman' is an interpolation of a Siouxsie Sioux song, 'Red Light'".[48] In 2003, The Beta Band sampled "Painted Bird" and changed the title in "Liquid Bird" on their Heroes to Zeros album.[49] Red Hot Chili Peppers performed "Christine" at the V2001 festival and introduced it to their British audience as "your national anthem".[50] DeVotchka covered "The Last Beat of My Heart" on the suggestion of Arcade Fire singer Win Butler: the musicians later considered it as the "centre-piece" of their Curse Your Little Heart EP.[51]
Siouxsie has also been hailed by other critically acclaimed groups. Morrissey, previously of The Smiths said that "Siouxsie and the Banshees were excellent. They were one of the great groups of the late 70s, early 80s".[52] He also stated of modern groups in 1994: "None of them are as good as Siouxsie and the Banshees at full pelt. That's not dusty nostalgia, that's fact." [53] Another ex-member of The Smiths, Johnny Marr mentioned that he rated very high guitarist John McGeoch for his work on Siouxsie's single "Spellbound". Marr qualified it as "clever" with "really good picky thing going on which is very un-rock'n'roll."[54] Radiohead also cited McGeoch-era Siouxsie records when mentioning the recording of "There There".[55]
Siouxsie has influenced other bands ranging from contemporaries U2 and The Cure to later acts like Jane's Addiction and TV on the Radio. U2 Frontman Bono named her as model in the band's 2006 autobiography U2 by U2. He was inspired by her way of singing.[56]: with his band, he selected "Christine" for a compilation made for Mojo's readers.[57] U2 guitarist The Edge also was the presenter of an award given to Siouxsie at a Mojo ceremony in 2005.[58][59] The Cure's Robert Smith declared in 2003: "Siouxsie and The Banshees and Wire were the two bands I really admired. They meant something."[60] He also pinpointed what the Join Hands tour brought him musically. "On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with The Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like The Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello, the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing."[61] For his record The Head on the Door in 1985, he stated : "It reminds me of the Kaleidoscope album, the idea of having lots of different sounding things, different colors".[62] Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction once made a parallel between his band and the Banshees: "there are so many similar threads: melody, use of sound, attitude, sex-appeal. I always saw Jane's Addiction as the masculine Siouxsie & the Banshees."[63] From a younger generation, Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio mentioned the poppiest songs of Siouxsie for the arrangements: "I've always tried to make a song that begins like "Kiss Them for Me". I think songs like "I Was a Lover" or "Wash the Day away" came from that element of surprise mode where all of a sudden this giant drum comes in and you're like, what the fuck?! That record was the first one where I was like, okay, even my friends're going to fall for this. I feel like that transition into that record was a relief for me. Really beautiful music was always considered too weird by the normal kids and that was the first example where I thought, we've got them, they're hooked! I watched people dance to that song, people who had never heard of any of the music that I listened to, they heard that music in a club and went crazy.[64]
Siouxsie has also been hailed by female singers. PJ Harvey selected Anima Animus album by Siouxsie's second band The Creatures in her top ten favourite albums of the year 1999.[65] Garbage's singer, Shirley Manson cited her as an influence : "I learned how to sing listening to The Scream and Kaleidoscope."[66] The singer of Garbage also mentioned that Siouxsie embodied everything she wanted to be as a young woman.[67] Gossip cited her as one of their influences for their 2009's Music For Men.[68] Ana Matronic of Scissor Sisters named Siouxsie as a source of inspiration and the Banshees as her favourite band.[69]
I keep a Rolodex of the women that vocally inspire me. There aren't that many, but she's definitely one of them. I remember one of the first times I heard "Red Light" it was at a party, and I remember going up to the DJ and being like, "Who's this?". It was that good. I kind of stopped and was like... wow. There's not a tremendous amount of women who are bold and forward thinking as artists. I feel like her music, at the time especially, was pretty unique in the way that it sort of matched her style. The freedom of experimenting with this dark place that doesn't have a place often in modern music.[70]
 (In 1981), the press began to describe them as a goth band. I never thought of them as goth. Goth has never been particularly angry, just a little dismayed. It had a weak, submissive side to it. Siouxsie & The Banshees always had a real edge to what they did. There was so much articulated spite, humour, politics with a small 'p' there that I never felt they went down that simple, gloomy path. People try to pass them off as a goth band because they find them dangerous and don't understand them. Today, I can see and hear the Banshees' influence all over the place.
In an interview with The Sunday Times in August 2007, she clarified that she and Budgie had divorced.[73] In an interview with The Independent, she said, "I've never particularly said I'm hetero or I'm a lesbian. I know there are people who are definitely one way, but not really me. I suppose if I am attracted to men then they usually have more feminine qualities."[74]

Siouxsie also performed with Suede a cover of "Carolyne Says" by Lou Reed, on 30 July 1993 at a "Red Hot & AIDS Benefit" concert.[79]

'Landlocked/ wind and bind/you grind and grind', growls Siouxsie with a seductive sneer.  It's a virile, sultry salute to lust and bondage, and will cure anybody of their hangover.  A spine-tingling achievement."

The appearances were extremely, expressively violent. And I wouldn't have had it any other way. But if you study modern groups, those who gain press coverage and chart action, most of them aren't actually as good as The Angelic Upstarts, aren't as exciting as Sham 69.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Susan Janet Ballion is best known as Siouxsie Sioux, the lead singer of Siouxsie and the Banshees (1976-1996), one of the original punk bands. The band evolved from punk, to goth and psychedelia to a more accessible sound in more recent years. The band was featured on the first Lollapalooza tour and provided original songs for Batman Returns (1992) and Showgirls (1995). After a twenty-year career, over a dozen diverse albums, and amassing a huge cult following, the group disbanded in April 1996 just as the Sex Pistols, their original inspiration, decided to cash in on the recent interest in punk music and tour again.In 2008, Siouxsie provided vocals for the track "Careless Love" on The Edge of Love (2008) soundtrack by frequent David Lynch collaborator, and composer Angelo Badalamenti. In 2011, Sioux was honored with the Q Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, and in 2012, the Ivor Novello Awards's Inspiration Award.
      Her father loved to read Rudyard Kipling, so she also fell in love with it. She credits Kipling's writing as inspiration for her florid lyric writing style.

=======================================================
BiographyRock history is littered with epiphanies, often involving the vision of Bowie and Mick Ronson performing Starman on Top of the Pops, the Pistols at the 100 Club or maybe Oasis at King Tuts in Glasgow. It's a path that has led to the establishment of a new aristocracy within music; an acceptance that, even in a supposedly alternative culture, we are basically all the same. But for many rock malcontents this was not the case and, for us, our epiphany was the first glorious manifestation of Siouxsie Sioux, the true outsider's outsider.It is impossible now to recreate the era in which Siouxsie hatched herself into the world as a fully fledged pop star, before she had even sung a note. This was a time of extreme exhibitionism and experimentation and none encapsulated the time better than Siouxsie and the Banshees. Amidst all the well-rehearsed, spurious  idea of chaos peddled by the majority of punk bands, Siouxsie's first ever time onstage saw her perform a truly chaotic and twisted version of the Lords Prayer at the 100 Club Punk Festival in 1976. The group had never played together and that line-up, featuring Sid Vicious on drums, never would again. "I don't know what it is but it isn't rock n roll" said an adversorial Pistols' Glen Matlock and those of us observing the charade that punk had already become could only cheer loudly from the sidelines.Disappearing to the suburbs to refocus, the group appeared months later with a unique  vision. This was music that polarised early audiences, moving them away from the elementary rhythms of punk to a sound which drew on influences as disparate as the Velvet Underground, Can, 'Low' era Bowie and J.G Ballard. It was a long way from anarchy in the UK.As the group toured they started to pick up a sizeable following and Siouxsie, always a star, became an antidote to what was very wrong with the music industry and its attitude towards strong women. It soon became apparent that her influence was even greater than  just through her remarkable music; the Siouxsie look, a beguiling mixture of aggression, power and strange fragility, became as iconic as that of Ziggy Stardust had been six years earlier. Something was happening, and it wasn't about an accepted notion of femininity, or indeed masculinity; this was something much more empowering for a whole generation of disaffected women and men.The group's first single "Hong Kong Garden" was released in 1978 and went straight into the charts at No 7. Their debut album "The Scream" was released later that year and was hailed as one of the best debut albums of all time.What followed for an amazing 17 years was a succession of records so glorious that it is hard to imagine groups today being able to emulate their power, their sense of gleeful experimentation and their total chart success.In the end though the true legacy of the group was more than a catalogue of brilliant records and tours that none of their contemporaries could ever match. For Siouxsie herself left a much stronger impression. As she continued with The Creatures, Siouxsie experimented further with the powerful  tribal rhythms she adored, matched with the power of her beguiling voice. Her expanding creativity would see this reluctant icon feted by her peers in the music and creative world throughout her whole musical career.Bearing that in mind, surprisingly little is known of the real Siouxsie Sioux, a rare  situation for an artist who has been making records for almost three decades.In 1978 Siouxsie's glacial image led to a music paper christening her The Ice Queen, an epithet which she seemed to embrace, confessing that year that she employed stark blue lighting to make her look cold and hard on stage.But just as it is easy to caricature an artist with a few broad brush strokes, The Ice Queen who captured the media and public imagination was a much more complex figure than  imagined.This  complexity  is most fully apparent on  Siouxsie's debut solo album "Mantaray", which will be released in September. On this record  she revels in a sense of freedom, something much more expansive than was displayed in any of her previous work. For  fans who thought she might never eclipse her Banshee and Creature highlights, this will be received with the form of rapture only reserved for the iconic. For those who have only dipped into her previous work, prepare to have any preconceptions shattered. And, most thrillingly, for a whole new generation of listeners, a slew of delights and surprises lies in store on what is surely one of the albums of 2007."Mantaray" is remarkable on many fronts, not least that all 8 tracks show an artist at the absolute peak of her powers. Musically it moves between the industrial heavy rhythms of the single "Into A Swan", through the modern glam stomp of "It's About To Happen" into the complex freeform playfulness of "Drone Zone", and the electronic, relentlessly hypnotic "Sea Of Tranquility", both of which could be the soundtrack for a David Lynch film...this is music like nothing else around right now.Lyrically too the album shows  Siouxsie in a less veiled light. It might be too trite to say this is the sound of the Ice Queen melting, but the statement has some validity. For a generation whose teenage years were spent in a liberating rush of idealised alienation, something had to give long ago. And just as Siouxsie was never truly the Ice Queen, this album shows her searching for a sense of her place in the world. It's altogether a more human, humane record than she has ever made, and all the better for it - the themes of the songs might encompass disappointment, distrust and despair, but they are bound together by a warmth of spirit that would have been anathema to the Siouxsie of 1978 but which is a true picture of this iconic artist in 2007.
