Brook Busey-Maurio (born June 14, 1978), better known by the pen name Diablo Cody,[1] is an American screenwriter, producer and director. She first became known for her candid chronicling of her year as a stripper in her "The Pussy Ranch" blog and in her memoir Candy Girl: A Year in the Life of an Unlikely Stripper (2005). Later, Cody achieved critical acclaim for her debut script Juno (2007), winning awards such as the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, the BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay.
She is also known for creating, writing and producing Showtime's television series United States of Tara (2009-2011) and for writing and producing the films Jennifer's Body (2009) and Young Adult (2011). For the latter, she received a second nomination for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay.[2] Her directorial debut, Paradise, was released on October 18, 2013.[3][4][5]
Cody and her older brother Marc were born and raised in Lemont, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. Cody was raised Catholic[6] and attended Benet Academy, a Roman Catholic school in Lisle, Illinois. She took the pen name Diablo Cody (diablo is Spanish for "devil") after repeatedly listening to the song "El Diablo" by Arcadia[7] while passing through Cody, Wyoming.[8] She graduated from the University of Iowa with a media studies degree.[9] While at the University of Iowa, she worked in the acquisitions department in the main university library.[10] Her first jobs were doing secretarial work at a Chicago law firm and later proofreading copy for advertisements that played on Twin Cities radio stations.
Cody began a parody weblog called Red Secretary, detailing the (fictional) exploits of a secretary living in Belarus.[11] The events were thinly-veiled allegories for events that happened in Cody's real life, but told from the perspective of a disgruntled, English-idiom-challenged Eastern Bloc girl.
Her first bona fide blog appeared under the nickname Darling Girl after she had moved from Chicago to Minneapolis, Minnesota.[11]
On a whim, Cody signed up for amateur night at a Minneapolis strip club called the Skyway Lounge.[9] Having enjoyed the experience, she eventually quit her day job and to become a full-time feminist stripper.[12] Cody also spent time working peep shows at Sex World, a Minneapolis adult novelty and DVD store.[citation needed]
While still stripping, Cody began writing for City Pages, an alternative Twin Cities weekly newspaper.[9] She left City Pages just before it changed editorial hands, and has since written for the now-defunct Jane magazine. In December 2007,[13] Cody began writing a column for the magazine Entertainment Weekly.
At the age of 27, Cody wrote her memoir Candy Girl: A Year in the Life of an Unlikely Stripper. The memoir began after Mason Novick, who would soon become Cody's manager, showed interest in her sharp and sarcastic voice. Based on the popularity "The Pussy Ranch" had received, he was able to secure her a publishing contract with Gotham Books.
After completion of her book, Cody was encouraged by Mason Novick to write her first screenplay.[8] Within months she wrote Juno, a coming-of-age story about a teenager's unplanned pregnancy. The Jason Reitman-directed comedy stars Ellen Page and Michael Cera.
In July 2007, Showtime announced that it would be producing a pilot of Cody's DreamWorks television series, United States of Tara. Based on an idea by Steven Spielberg,[citation needed] Tara is a comedy about a mother with dissociative identity disorder, starring Toni Collette.[14] The series began filming in Spring 2008, and premiered on January 18, 2009.
In October 2007, Cody sold a script titled Girly Style to Universal Studios, and a horror script called Jennifer's Body to Fox Atomic.[15] Released on September 18, 2009, Jennifer's Body starred Megan Fox as the title character.[16] She revised writer-director Steven Antin's script for his musical film Burlesque.[17]
Cody is a friend of screenwriters Dana Fox (What Happens in Vegas, Couples Retreat) and Lorene Scafaria (Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist) and they often write their screenplays together in order to get advice from one another.[18]
Cody made a small cameo appearance as herself in the U.S. broadcast television series 90210 (2008). She appeared in the same episode that marked the return of Tori Spelling as Donna Martin, in which Cody needed Spelling's character to make a dress for a red carpet event.
In 2009, Cody signed on to script and produce a film adaptation of the Sweet Valley High young adult book series.[19] In 2011, she was brought in to revise first-time feature director Fede Alvarez's script for a remake of Sam Raimi's 1980s horror film The Evil Dead.[20]
Since October, 2011, Cody has hosted an online celebrity interview program called "Red Band Trailer," on the broadband channel, L-studio.[21] She originally launched the series privately on YouTube in summer 2010, and the Lexus channel picked it up the following year.
On the WTF with Marc Maron podcast, on February 24, 2012, she said her next project would be directing her first film, which is about a young woman who abandons religion after surviving a plane crash. In February 2013, she said that the film is called Paradise (firstly known as Lamb of God). Julianne Hough, Holly Hunter, Octavia Spencer and Russell Brand are in the cast. Mandate Pictures produced it.[22][23]
In May 2013, it was announced that Cody will host her own talk show, Me Time with Diablo Cody, at TBS. The program will tailor "around Diablo’s unique perspective on all things pop culture and told in her very own tongue-in-cheek way," and "reveal a side of Hollywood and celebs that the public very rarely gets to see." Steve Agee will be presenting and writing with her as well. Cody is also a producer, alongside Mark Cronin and Courtland Cox. The pilot of the talk show is in works.[25][26]
She is currently developing a teen-drama TV series with Josh Schwartz for Fox called Prodigy. According to the The Hollywood Reporter, it is about a "a 16-year-old genius who through home schooling has been isolated from her peers. Hoping to experience a “normal” teen social life before she enters the adult world of academia, she enrolls in her local high school. Her experiment goes off the rails when she finds herself adopted by a wild crowd, getting caught up in a whirlwind of romance and crime."[27][28] Cody is also linked to Warner Bros. Television's romantic comedy Alex +Amy.[29]
In her book, she wrote fondly of her boyfriend "Jonny" (musician Jon Hunt). They were married from 2004 until 2007,[citation needed] during which time she was known in personal life as Brook Busey-Hunt.[9]
On April 6, 2010, Cody announced that she was expecting her first child with her husband Dan Maurio, who works on Chelsea Lately, on which Cody also appears frequently as a "roundtable" guest. The couple married in the summer of 2009.[30] Their son was born in 2010.[31] Cody had her second child in 2012.[32]
Juno was runner-up for the Toronto International Film Festival People's Choice Award, won second prize at the Rome Film Festival, and earned four Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture. Cody herself won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for her debut script, which also picked up a Golden Globe nomination and an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay. She also won screenplay honors from BAFTA, the Writers Guild of America, the Broadcast Film Critics Association, the National Board of Review, the Satellite Awards, and the 2008 Cinema for Peace Award for Most Valuable Work of Director, Producer & Screenwriter (which she shared with Jason Reitman, John Malkovich, Mason Novick, Russel Smith and Lianne Halfon).[33] For Young Adult, Cody was nominated by awards associations such as the Broadcast Film Critics Association and the Writers Guild of America. With Reitman, the director, and the actors Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt, she shared the Chairman's Vanguard Award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. In 2012, the Fempire, the collaboration of writers Cody, Dana Fox, Liz Meriwether, and Lorene Scafaria received the Creativity and Sisterhood Award from the Athena Film Festival for their support for one another in the competitive film industry.[34]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Diablo Cody is originally from Chicago, Illinois, and moved to Minnesota to live with her Internet boyfriend, Jonny who later became her husband. While there, she decided on a whim to take up stripping as a hobby of sorts.She was working at an ad agency and got a promotion. The job wore her ragged and was something she did not particularly care for. It demanded organization which is something at which she was not very good. Eventually, she quit her day job with Jonny's blessings and began stripping full-time. During the course of about a year she went from Amateur Night, which was her first stripping experience, to a place she refers to in her book as Sheiks, then to Déjà Vu, and so on. She then took up work as a phone-sex operator before returning to stripping.Shortly thereafter she decided to quit stripping and she and Jonny married. They moved to what she refers to as "the 'burbs, and no one strips unless they're taking a bubble bath." Her stepdaughter was the flower girl in the wedding.
        Her writing frequently centers on a woman or girl with a public and obvious external struggle who is also hiding a much more personal internal struggle.
      After marriage, she and her husband, Jon Hunt, combined and hyphenated their last names. She went by Brook Busey-Hunt and he was Jon Busey-Hunt. Diablo Cody is a pen name.
      Ranked #38 on Entertainment Weekly's 2007 list of the 50 Smartest People in Hollywood (issue #968, December 7, 2007).
      Attended Benet Academy, a college-preparatory Catholic high school, located in Lisle, Illinois, USA. Another student who attended was Tim McGrath.
      Is the only author to have been inducted into Dave's Book Club on Late Show with David Letterman (1993).
      Has been a recurring columnist for Entertainment Weekly since December 2007. Her column appears on the last page of the magazine.
      When Juno (2007) star Ellen Page hosted Saturday Night Live (1975), Diablo Cody was impersonated by Andy Samberg in Ellen's opening monologue.
      Former freelance journalist. When she was living in Minneapolis, she was the associated arts editor for "City Pages", an alternative weekly.
      Gave birth to a son at age 32. Marcello Daniel Maurio, on Tuesday (July 27, 2010). This is the first child for Diablo and her husband, Chelsea Lately (2007) staff member Daniel Maurio.
      Hobby is riding roller coasters. Husband, Daniel Maurio, proposed to her while they were riding a roller coaster.
      I have never been an ambitious person, and my participation in this industry is a fluke, but only male writers can afford to be coy and self-deprecating.
      I've been told that I'm incompetent, socially retarded, maladjusted. I still know that I couldn't function in reality. Los Angeles is a good place for me.
      [on screenplay-writing for actresses] The attitude toward women in this industry is nauseating. There are all sorts of porcine executives who are uncomfortable with a woman doing anything subversive. They want the movie about the beautiful girl who trips and falls, the adorable klutz.
      When you're in a competitive environment, always give out the impression that you don't care. It makes people want you more. If you act desperate, it's over. I think a passive attitude is helpful.
      I really like writing. I always hear people using that old quote, 'I don't like writing. I like having written'. I don't feel that, like I'm sad when I'm done writing something. I think it's gotten harder. With something like 'Juno', I didn't think anybody was going to read it, whereas something like 'Paradise', I'm writing it thinking I might actually direct this and people are going to comment on it and watch it. It's really hard to do that kind of thing, especially when you're perceiving how the audience will react.
      The weirdest thing about directing in general is that you're surrounded by these actors that you respect, and they're so good at what they do, and they're asking you what they should be doing. That's directing, but to me it was such a mind-fuck because it's like you're asking me what you should do in this scene? I have no idea. I'm just the hack that wrote the script! It's crazy the amount of trust people put in you. It's a tremendous amount of pressure.
      I don't know what a 'personal trainer' would be in Minneapolis, probably some guy who makes you go out and chop wood.
      You know, there's this whole idea that virginity is a sacred flower or something, and an imbalance in the way that women's sexuality is presented - and I hate that. So I want to write a film that challenges that.
=======================================================
From All Movie Guide: After trading in her given name of Brook Busey-Hunt for the snappier pseudonym Diablo Cody, this Illinois native raised eyebrows online in addition to dimly lit peep-show booths with her blog, <i>Pussy Ranch</i>, as well as her 2006 memoir, {-Candy Girl: A Year in the Life of an Unlikely Stripper}. Cody, who graduated college with a degree in media studies and spent the early days of her career doing clerical work at a Chicago bankruptcy firm, found herself intrigued by the darker, raunchier elements of nightlife; eventually, her participation in a notoriously seedy Minneapolis strip club's amateur night led to the decision to leave her day job and become a full-time stripper. As luck would have it, anyone with an Internet connection and a penchant for living vicariously through others could check Cody's goings-on via her blog, which, thanks to her trademark humor and keen insight into the mass psyche of the sex industry, paved the way to other, more traditional journalistic endeavors, including writing for the City Pages (a Minneapolis publication), The Village Voice, and Jane magazine. After the completion and subsequent success of {-Candy Girl}, Cody was propositioned to write a screenplay; she accepted and wrote the coming-of-age comedy drama Juno, a runner-up for the People's Choice Award at the prestigious Toronto Film Festival. Juno also earned Cody an award for Breakthrough Screenwriter at the Hollywood Film Festival, a Golden Globe nomination, a Writers Guild nomination, and an Oscar nomination. In addition to selling several of her other screenplays, most notably Girly Style and Jennifer's Body, Cody also wrote for the Showtime television series The United States of Tara, a comedy starring Toni Collette as a mother with multiple personality disorder, created by Steven Spielberg and produced by his DreamWorks production company. Over the coming years, Cody would continue to pen a variety of projects, like the dark comedy Young Adult. ~ Tracie Cooper, Rovi

Diablo CodyWriterBorn: 14 June 1978Birthplace: Lemont, IllinoisBest known as: The former blogger and stripper who wrote the movie JunoDiablo Cody is the pseudonym of Brook Busey, the Oscar-winning writer of Jason Reitman's 2007 film Juno (starring Ellen Page). The quick version of Cody's life is as famous as her movie: college graduate, then stripper, then blogger about being a stripper. The buzz around her blog, Pussy Ranch, led to a book deal, and at the age of 24 she published a memoir titled Candy Girl: A Year in the Life of an Unlikely Stripper (2005). Her naughty-but-nonthreatening backstory made her a media darling in 2007, and her best original screenplay Oscar for Juno sealed her place as a celebrity writer. With Steven Spielberg she created the cable series The United States of Tara in 2008. She also wrote the Megan Fox grrl-power horror movie Jennifer's Body (2009).Extra credit: Diablo Cody married Dan Maurio in 2009; at the time of their marriage, he was on the off-camera staff of the late-night show Chelsea Lately. Their first child, Marcello Daniel Maurio, was born on 28 July 2010.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC. All rights reserved.More on Diablo Cody from Infoplease:

      “In my opinon, the best thing you can do is find a person who loves you for exactly what you are. Good mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty, handsome, what have you, the right person will still think the sun shines out your ass. That's the kind of person that's worth sticking with.”
