David Hyde Pierce (born April 3, 1959) is an American actor and comedian. Pierce is known for playing the psychiatrist Dr. Niles Crane on the hit NBC sitcom Frasier, for which he won four Emmy Awards during the show's run.
The youngest of four siblings, Pierce was born in Saratoga Springs, New York. His father, George (deceased), was an aspiring actor, and his mother, Laura Marie (née Hughes) (deceased), was an insurance agent. Pierce has three older siblings: Barbara, Nancy, and Thomas,[1] and added his middle name "Hyde" to avoid confusion with another actor named David Pierce.[2]
As a child, Pierce frequently played organ at the local Bethesda Episcopal Church, Saratoga Springs.[3] He began acting while in high school, earning recognition as best Dramatic Arts student. In 1977, Pierce received the Yaddo Medal for character and scholarship and worked in theater while a counselor at Camp Kabeyun in New Hampshire.[4] However, his love of music was still strong, so he decided to study classical piano at Yale University. However, Pierce soon grew bored with music history lessons and found that he was not dedicated enough to practice the required hours to become a successful concert pianist. Instead, he graduated in 1981 with a double major in English and Theatre Arts, continuing to play piano as a hobby.
While attending Yale, Pierce performed and directed student productions, appearing as Sir Joseph Porter, K.C.B., in the Yale Gilbert & Sullivan Society's production of H.M.S. Pinafore. He also directed the Gilbert & Sullivan Society's operetta Princess Ida and occasionally accompanied rehearsals on the piano. Among other roles Pierce played at Yale were in Waiting for Godot, Saint Joan, and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?.
After his graduation, Pierce moved to New York City, where during the 1980s and early 1990s he was employed in various jobs, such as selling ties at Bloomingdale's and working as a security guard, while pursuing an acting career and studying at Michael Howard Studios. During this period he played Laertes in a popular off-Broadway production of Hamlet and made his Broadway debut in Christopher Durang's Beyond Therapy in 1982.[5]
Pierce's first big television break came in the early 1990s with Norman Lear's political comedy The Powers That Be, in which Pierce played Theodore, a Congressman.[6] Despite positive reviews from critics, the show was canceled after a brief run.
In part due to his close physical resemblance to Kelsey Grammer,[7] the producers of the Cheers spin-off Frasier created the role of Niles Crane (Frasier Crane's younger brother) for him.[6] Although prior to Frasier going into production, Pierce had petitioned the Screen Actors Guild to change his billing to David Pierce, the name he had used on the stage, the use of his middle name in the show's credits helped reinforce the actor's and the character's "snooty" image.[7] For his work on Frasier, Pierce was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Emmy a record eleven consecutive years, winning in 1995, 1998, 1999 and 2004.

Pierce also appeared alongside Jodie Foster in Little Man Tate, with Anthony Hopkins in Oliver Stone's Nixon, and with Ewan McGregor in Down With Love.[6] He provided the voice for Doctor Doppler in Disney's 42nd animated feature, Treasure Planet, Slim, a stick insect in Pixar's A Bug's Life and Abe Sapien in Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy. In 2001, he starred in the cult 1980s summer camp comedy Wet Hot American Summer as the befuddled astrophysicist, Prof. Henry Newman. In his role in Sleepless in Seattle, Pierce played the brother of Meg Ryan's character, a professor at Johns Hopkins University. The movie was released just three months before the start of Frasier.[6]
In 2005, Pierce joined Tim Curry and others in the stage production of Spamalot.[6] In August and September 2006, he starred as Lieutenant Frank Cioffi in Curtains, a new Kander and Ebb musical staged at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles. In March 2007, Curtains opened on Broadway[6] and on June 10, 2007 Pierce won the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical at the 61st Tony Awards for his performance.[6] In his acceptance speech, Pierce said the first words he spoke on a Broadway stage were, "I'm sorry, I'm going to have to ask you to leave."[8]
On November 19, 2007, Pierce was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts Degree from Niagara University in Lewiston, New York. He was earlier awarded, (1999), an Honorary Degree from Skidmore College, located in his native Saratoga Springs. In 2010, Pierce appeared in a revival of David Hirson's play La Bête directed by Matthew Warchus. The production debuted on London's West End before moving to New York.[9] Also in 2010, Pierce had his first starring film role as Warwick Wilson in the dark comedy/psychological thriller The Perfect Host.
Pierce is known for his distinctive voice and, similar to his Frasier co-star, Kelsey Grammer, he is often called upon to provide voice work. His notable roles include the narrator of the movie "The Mating Habits of the Earthbound Human" in 1999, walking stick insect Slim in A Bug's Life, Doctor Delbert Doppler in Disney's film Treasure Planet, and the amphibian Abe Sapien in Hellboy.[6] Pierce refused credit for his Hellboy role because he felt it was the performance of Doug Jones, and not his own voice, which ultimately brought the character of Abe Sapien to life.[10] He was the voice for Drix, a cold pill in the animated comedy Osmosis Jones.
In a deliberate in-joke, he voiced Cecil, the brother of Kelsey Grammer-voiced Sideshow Bob, in The Simpsons episode "Brother from Another Series", in which the two characters parallel the Frasier-Niles relationship. At one point in the episode, Cecil mistakes Bart for Maris, the unseen wife of Niles on Frasier. He returned as Cecil in the Season 19 episode "Funeral for a Fiend" where Frasier co-star John Mahoney (who starred as Frasier and Niles' father in the show) voices Dr. Robert Terwilliger, Sr., the father of Cecil and Sideshow Bob. Pierce also provided the voice of Mr. Daedalus in the 1998 Disney show Hercules: The Animated Series. In 2006, he co-starred in the animated pilot for The Amazing Screw-On Head as the Screw-On Head's nemesis Emperor Zombie; however, the series was not picked up. His commercial voiceover work included ads for the Tassimo coffee system, Seattle's Metro Transit and home furnishings retailer IKEA Canada.[11]
After years of media speculation about his sexuality, Pierce came out in 2007 and later confirmed through his publicist that he and television writer, director and producer Brian Hargrove were a couple.[12][13] When accepting his Tony Award for Curtains, Pierce thanked "my partner, Brian, because it's 24 years of listening to your damn notes—that's why I'm up here tonight."[14] They married in California on October 24, 2008, just days before Proposition 8 was adopted as law, banning same-sex marriages in the state.[15] On May 28, 2009, while a guest on The View, he publicly announced his marriage to Hargrove and expressed his anger over the approval of Proposition 8.[16][17] Pierce and Hargrove divide their time between New York and Los Angeles.
He and Frasier co-star John Mahoney are godparents to Frasier co-star Jane Leeves' son, Finn.[18] Pierce has spent years working with the Alzheimer's Association on behalf of Americans with Alzheimer's disease. He has appeared in Washington D.C. to testify in support of expanding funding for treatment, and he has publicly campaigned for the (ultimately successful) National Alzheimer's Project Act. He told MSNBC in 2011, "it is up to us, to all of us, to the American people and to their representatives about whether we face the challenges and make all the effort necessary or if we ignore it and just let this sort of tidal wave crash over us."[19]

          David Hyde Pierce was born on 3 April 1959 in Saratoga Springs, New York, USA. He is the youngest child of George and Laura Pierce (both deceased) and has two older sisters (Barbara and Nancy) and an older brother (Thomas). As a child, he was very interested in music (particularly piano) and regularly played the organ at his local church (Bethesda Episcopal Church). David discovered a love of drama in high school and, upon his graduation in 1977, he received the Yaddo Medal which is to honor academic achievement and personal character. However, his love of music was still strong so he decided to study classical piano at Yale University. Unfortunately, he soon grew bored with music history lessons and found that he wasn't dedicated enough to practice the required amount of hours to become a successful concert pianist. Instead, he returned to his love of drama and graduated in 1981 with a double major in English and Theatre Arts. He then moved to New York where he worked several menial jobs (including selling ties at Bloomingdales and working as a security guard) while acting in the theater during the late 80s and early 90s. He appeared in small roles in films such as Bright Lights, Big City (1988) before his life and career changed forever when he landed the role of "Dr. Niles Crane" in the television series Frasier (1993). Throughout the show's eleven year run (1993-2004), David was nominated for an Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor each year (he won four times: 1995, 1998, 1999 and 2004). David resides in Los Angeles with his romantic partner, 'Brian Hargrove', and their two Wheaton Terriers, Maude and Mabel. He remains very close to his three siblings.
      Received the Yaddo Medal as best dramatic arts student upon graduation from Saratoga Springs High School, 1977.
      He received his initial interview with the creators of Frasier (1993) due to his close resemblance to Kelsey Grammer. After the interview, the part of Niles Crane was written for him.
      Is active in the fight to find a cure for Alzheimer's, which his grandfather suffered and died from. His father also suffered from the disease but died from pneumonia.
      Holds the record for being nominated for most Best Supporting Actor Emmys for a character, "Dr. Niles Crane" on Frasier (1993). He was nominated 11 times.
      Attended Yale with Jodie Foster. When she was preparing to direct Little Man Tate (1991), she remembered him from a play he was in at that time and called and offered him a part.
      Made his debut with the New York Philaharmonic in April 2003 in the role of "Benedict", in the concert staging of Berlioz's opera "Beatrice and Benedict". Harriet Sansom Harris, (agent "Bebe Glazer" on Frasier (1993)) played "Beatrice" opposite Pierce.
      Asked not to be credited as the voice of "Abe Sapien" in Hellboy (2004) because he felt the characterization of Abe truly belonged to Doug Jones (the actor who played Abe on the set).
      One year when he was performing at the international comedy festival "Just for Laughs", he arrived in Montreal for check-in with the festival exhausted and disheveled. He remarked to one of the festival workers how he was looking forward to resting in his hotel room. The worker replied with empathy, saying how tired they were working overtime with few breaks trying to tie up the loose ends and help the performers before the comedy routines. Moments later, Pierce returned with fresh coffee and pastries for all those working at the Festival's check-in.
      Has played Kelsey Grammer's brother twice: on Frasier (1993) and on The Simpsons (1989) episode: "Brother From Another Series". John Mahoney also played the father of both pairs of characters.
      Pierce resides in Los Angeles with his longtime partner TV writer/director/producer Brian Hargrove.
      He was nominated for a 1984 Joseph Jefferson Award for Director of a Revue for "Candida" at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago, Illinois.
      He was nominated for a 1984 Joseph Jefferson Award for Actor in a Principal Role in a Play for "Candida" at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago, Illinois.
      Companion of Brian Hargrove since the early '80s. David said in his Tony award acceptance speech in 2007 that he has been with Brian for 24 years. They moved together to Los Angeles (where they still live) in the early '90s.
      He named his five favorite films as The Godfather (1972), Bonnie and Clyde (1967), Dracula (1958), Neokonchennaya pyesa dlya mekhanicheskogo pianino (1977) and A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982).

      Has been selected to play "brave Sir Robin" in the Broadway production of "Spamalot," the musical version of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail," scheduled to open on Broadway in February, 2005. [July 2004]
      I can vividly recall telling a joke in, like, second grade and realizing it was funnier if I didn't laugh. I've been deadpan ever since.
      [Speaking on "The View" on May 28, 2009, about his activism for same-sex marriage] I've been going [to marriage-equality rallies] because I had the experience of...having this private thing [marriage] suddenly dragged out into the public and having people I don't know take a vote--I mean, can you imagine? If you're married, the people in your state getting together and saying, "well, you know what, you're not." It's a very odd thing. And I understand all the religious and emotional issues that are involved, but I don't...it was a very angry-making feeling, both in November when it was taken away from me and this past Tuesday, sitting in front of my television wondering, "gee, I hope the Supreme Court thinks it's okay for us to be married." Excuse me--it's none of your business.

The Weekend Playlist: Dead Popular, 40 Years of Great PerformancesOct 18, 2013 09:05 AM ETby Matt RoushIs "I've Got You Under My Skin" the most appropriate sweet nothing to croon in the skin-crawling world of AMC's The Walking Dead? No matter, because there's not much of a lull in Sunday's powerful episode (9/8c), ominously titled "Infected." Which suggests the virus that felled Nerd Boy last week creates a bloody panic in the cell block, reminding us how illusory any notion of safety can be. "I haven't seen anybody be lucky in a long time," former Army medic Bob Stookey (new regular Lawrence Gilliard Jr.) observes as a full gamut of courage, terror and anguish is displayed during and after the latest crisis. Earning special bonus stripes this week: Melissa McBride as the awesome Carol, who takes a few distraught girls under her wing, but not to coddle them: "You want to live, you have to become strong" is her mantra. Meanwhile, the walkers keep pressing up against the prison gates and the audience can't get enough of the riveting mayhem, as evidenced by the record numbers who turned out for last Sunday's premiere.read moreVIDEO: Brandeis is Looking For a JobOct 13, 2013 03:50 AMBrandeis is Looking For a JobPaid | Amazon Instant VideoLength: 57:00Aired: 9/24/2012Brandeis wants a job.

Gender: Male Born: April 3, 1959 Birthplace: Saratoga Springs, New York, USA Nationality: United States 
From All Movie Guide: Although he is best known for his role as anal-retentive psychiatrist extraordinaire Niles Crane on the celebrated sitcom Frasier, David Hyde Pierce has also done considerable work on the stage and screen. Fair, birdlike, and bearing an uncanny resemblance to Frasier co-star Kelsey Grammer, Pierce is one of the entertainment business' finest purveyors of a certain kind of blue-blooded neuroticism, and, in the eyes of some viewers, has even gone so far as to make insecurity perversely sexy.Born in Saratoga Springs, New York, on April 3, 1959, Pierce was raised in what he has described as a "very run-of-the-mill, middle-class" household. When he was eight, he began taking piano lessons, and he decided to pursue a career as a concert pianist. He continued to train until he got to Yale University, where he realized that he was better suited to the acting profession. Following graduation, Pierce moved to New York and did a brief stint as a tie salesman at Bloomingdale's before being cast in a Broadway play. Although the production was a flop, Pierce continued to work on the stage in New York and Chicago for several years and was eventually cast as a suicidal congressman on the short-lived sitcom The Powers That Be in 1992. His work on the show, coupled with his resemblance to Kelsey Grammer, led to his casting on Frasier the following year.Frasier proved to be the turning point in Pierce's career. His portrayal of Niles, aside from winning him a slew of awards, including an Emmy, also provided a number of opportunities for the actor on the big screen. Pierce, who had been acting sporadically in films since the early '80s, could be seen in supporting roles in such '90s films as Sleepless in Seattle (1993), Nixon (1995), in which he played John Dean, and the animated A Bug's Life (1998), for which he provided the voice of a stick insect.As the first decade of the 21st century opened, Pierce began appearing in more and more feature films, selecting an eclectic array of roles that utitlized his strengths without resorting to rehashing the Niles Crane character. Diverse in their genre and theme, the projects also ranged in their levels of success and acclaim. The 2000 comedy Isn't She Great was an abysmal failure, while the indie films Wet Hot American Summer and Full Frontal both left audiences and critics fiercely split. Pierce also continued to flex his voice skills in the animated features Osmosis Jones and Treasure Planet.One of Pierce's best-received roles came in 2003, when he costarred in the tongue-in-cheek comedy Down With Love. While not much of a box-office hit, the film managed to charm many critics with its wall-to-wall homages to 1960s sex-comedies. A year later, Pierce again showed up sans-body, providing the voice of Abe Sapien in the comic-book adaptation Hellboy. He reunited with Hellboy creator Mike Mignola's animated comic adaptation The Amazing Screw-On Head to voice the role of the dreaded Emperor Zombie in 2006, and joined the cast of The Perfect Host in 2010 for a leading role as Warwick Wilson, whose genteel façade hides a deep rage and mental instability. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi
