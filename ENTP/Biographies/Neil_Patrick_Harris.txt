 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Neil Patrick Harris was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on June 15, 1973. He grew up in Ruidoso, New Mexico, a small town 120 miles south of Albuquerque, where he first took up acting in the fourth grade. While tagging along with his older brother of 3 years, Harris won the part of Toto in a school production of The Wizard of Oz (1939).His parents, Ron (a lawyer) and Sheila (a writer), moved the family to Albuquerque in 1988, the same year that Harris made his film debut in two movies: Purple People Eater (1988) and Clara's Heart (1988), which starred Whoopi Goldberg. A year later, when Neil was 16, he landed the lead role in Steven Bochco's television series about a teen prodigy doctor at a local hospital, Doogie Howser, M.D. (1989), which launched Harris into teen-heartthrob status. The series lasted1989-1993 and earned him a People's Choice Award for Favorite Male Performer in a New Series (1990) and a Golden Globe Nomination (1990). Harris attended the same high school as Freddie Prinze Jr., La Cueva High School in Albuquerque. Neil acted on stage in a few plays while there, one of which was his senior play, Fiddler on the Roof (1971), in which he portrayed Lazar Wolf the butcher (1991).When "Doogie Howser, M.D." stopped production in 1993, Harris took up stage acting, which he had always wanted to do. After a string of made-for-television movies, Harris acted in his first big screen roles in nine years, Starship Troopers (1997) with Casper Van Dien and then The Proposition (1998). In July 1997, Harris accepted the role of Mark Cohen for the Los Angeles production of the beloved musical, Rent (2005). His performance in "Rent" garnered him a Drama-League Award in 1997. He continued in the musical, to rave reviews, until January 1998. He later reprised the role for six nights in his hometown of Albuquerque, New Mexico, in December 1998.In 1999, Harris returned to television in the short-lived sitcom Stark Raving Mad (1999), with Tony Shalhoub. He was also in the big-screen projects The Next Best Thing (2000) and Undercover Brother (2002), and he can be heard as the voice of Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the newest animated Spider-Man (2003) series. Harris has continued his stage work, making his Broadway debut in 2001 in "Proof." He has also appeared on stage in "Romeo and Juliet," "Cabaret," Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street in Concert (2001), and, most recently, "Assassins." In 2005, Harris returned to the small screen in a guest-starring role on Numb3rs (2005) and a starring role in the sitcom How I Met Your Mother (2005). Neil played the title role in the web-exclusive musical comedy Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog (2008), widely downloaded via iTunes to become the #1 TV series for five straight weeks, despite not actually being on television.
      Has performed magic tricks on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962), Late Show with David Letterman (1993), The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992), Ellen: The Ellen DeGeneres Show (2003) and The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson (2005).
      Has sung since he was a child. His father played the folk guitar and together they entertained.
      His parents own a restaurant called "Perreniel's" in Albuquerque. His brother is now running the restaurant.
      Based on his Los Angeles stage performance in the musical Rent, he was attached to play Mark Cohen in a television mini series based on the Broadway musical, with Wilson Cruz as Angel, Rikki Lee Travolta as Roger Davis, and singer Shakira as Mimi, but the rights were pulled in order for Chris Columbus to make a film adaptation using much of the original Broadway cast including Anthony Rapp in the role of Mark.
      Is an avid Les Miserables fan, and performed the song "The Confrontation" with his co-star Jason Segel (both of How I Met Your Mother (2005) fame) live on The Megan Mullally Show (2006). He performed the role of Javert, to wild cheers from the audience.
      He was the "Not My Job" guest on the April 5, 2008, episode of the National Public Radio quiz show "Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!".
      Typically, actors playing themselves on film are listed "as Himself" in the film's credits. Due to the over-the-top, outlandish nature of his role in Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (2004) and Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay (2008), he requested that his credit read "Neil Patrick Harris" instead of "as Himself". This was to make clear that he was playing a fictional character that was in no way a true representation of himself.
      According to an oral history of Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog (2008) published in July 2008 in Entertainment Weekly, he auditioned to play the doctor role on Firefly (2002) that was eventually filled by Sean Maher.
      He is credited using all three names because there was already a different actor named Neil Harris in the Screen Actors Guild by the time he first got his SAG card. Harris joked on NPR's "Fresh Air with Terry Gross" that he uses all three names because it's "far more theatrical," and that he and his parents considered using names like "Neil Danger Harris" or "Neil Patrick Rocket".
      Has been in a committed relationship with stage and screen actor David Burtka, his partner since 2004.
      Harris's closest friends include his companion David Burtka, Amy Acker, Lori and Lex Medlin, Becky Baeling, and Brandon Boyce.
      Enjoys Red Bull so much on and off the set of How I Met Your Mother (2005) that he was given a lifetime supply of it and a mini-refrigerator by the company that makes the drink because of the amount of free advertising he has given it.
      In one year, he hosted The 7th Annual TV Land Awards (2009), The 63rd Annual Tony Awards (2009), and The 61st Primetime Emmy Awards (2009). All three ceremonies featured him singing a song about the occasion that had been written for him by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman.
      Recipient of the 2009 The Trevor Life Award, which annually honors an "individual who, through his or her example, support, volunteerism and/or occupation, is an inspiration to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, or Questioning youth." The award is presented by The Trevor Project, a national crisis and suicide prevention organization helping LGBTQ young people who are facing familial rejection or considering suicide. The next year, he was elected to the Board of Directors of the Trevor Project.
      All in the same award season, he hosted The 61st Primetime Emmy Awards (2009) and The 63rd Annual Tony Awards (2009), presented an award at The 67th Annual Golden Globe Awards (2010) and had an opening act at The 82nd Annual Academy Awards (2010).

      Told Howard Stern that he had plastic surgery to pin his ears back so that they would not stick out as much as they did when he was an adolescent.

      In June 2013, the New York Times reported that Harris is set to star in the title role in the first Broadway production of John Cameron Mitchell's rock musical "Hedwig and the Angry Inch", scheduled for spring 2014.
      In 2011, Harris and Burtka told People Magazine that they were each the biological father of one of their twins. Harris said: "We found an egg donor anonymously through a hilarious process of looking at people's profiles and then an amazing surrogate who had helped a same-sex couple before. And then we inserted two eggs, one with my sperm, one with David's sperm and they both took." Burtka added: "We don't know whose is whose."

      People Magazine, November 3, 2006: "Rather than ignore those who choose to publish their opinions without actually talking to me, I am happy to dispel any rumors or misconceptions and am quite proud to say that I am a very content gay man living my life to the fullest and feel most fortunate to be working with wonderful people in the business I love."
      I heard through the grapevine that they'd written this movie and that I was in it, and that I had to call my attorneys and make it stop -- that it was a bad thing, and I read it and thought it was hilarious. A friend was auditioning for a different part in the movie and said, 'do you know about this movie that you're in?' - on playing "Neil Patrick Harris" in Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (2004).
      Comedy is way more difficult than drama. What I might find funny, the editor might not find funny. They might choose the reaction shot from Take 4 with my line from Take 1 with my next line from Take 7, and then the timing that I was trying to do does not come across.
      She's like the coolest, nicest chick ever. She's an absolute catch, and I thought if I'm not going to feel the super sparks with her, then it probably means that I'm gay. [Speaking to Howard Stern about having dated actress Christine Taylor in his early 20s].
      I'm not the biggest fan of the word 'partner'. It either means that we run a business together or we're cowboys. 'Boyfriend' seems fleeting, like maybe we met two weeks ago. I've been saying 'better half' for as long as I've been able to. I think it's a little self-deprecating and clearly defines that we're in a relationship, but it would be nice to say 'my husband'.

After a preview at the San Diego Comic-Con, a musical episode of Batman: The Brave and the Bold, featuring Harris as the villainous Music Meister, premiered on October 23, 2009 on Cartoon Network. As a character who could make anyone do his bidding by singing, he spent most of the episode singing several original songs.[24]
In 2014, Harris turned down the chance to replace David Letterman as host of the Late Show on CBS, stating that he feared he would get bored of the repetition hosting the show entails. He also rejected the suggestion of replacing Craig Ferguson as host of The Late Late Show on the same grounds.[25]

In A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas, a joke refers to his coming out.

Burtka also played himself in the film, as Harris' secret drug dealer.
Harris and Burtka bought a townhouse on Fifth Avenue in Harlem in 2013, the neighborhood where they had been living for many years previously.[39]

Like the year in which Future Ted is recounting his stories, How I Met Your Mother may have been a little ahead of its time.  "I think [that] the best format for this series is ultimately as a download or a DVD — a binge-watch," co-creator and executive producer Carter Bays tells TVGuide.com.  "I think we should've been on Netflix," co-creator and executive producer Craig Thomas quips. "Maybe people wouldn't have been as upset at us. We could've been the first House of Cards!"How I Met Your Mother: A chronological timeline of craziness  Eight years before House of Cards first booked up your weekends, HIMYM premiered in September 2005 at a time when the traditional sitcom was struggling and single-camera comedies were just starting to take off.

Birth Name: Neil Pattrick HarrisBirth Place: Albuquerque, NMDate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 06/15/1973, GeminiProfession: Actor
To some he will forever be teen doctor Doogie Howser. But those more familiar with Harris' career know that he successfully transformed himself from a baby-faced lead into a versatile character actor. After making an his film debut in 1988's Clara's Heart, Harris became known for his small-screen work, including Doogie Howser, M.D. and a plethora of TV-movies. As an adult, he moved to big-screen supporting parts (the lone white guy in 1997's Undercover Brother; a scientist in 2002's Starship Troopers) and even conquered Broadway with his impressively powerful vocals in Cabaret and Assassins. In 2005, he returned to series television as a womanizing wise guy on How I Met Your Mother, a wonderfully ironic role considering that Harris acknowledged he was gay when he officially came out in November 2006. He had initially remained mum on the subject, although he did poke fun at his ambiguous sexual orientation on Will & Grace when he guest-starred as a "reformed" homosexual. When he's not on stage or set, Harris has been known to indulge in his passion for magic---both as a fan and as an amateur performer.Neil Patrick Harris Fast Facts:
Was discovered by screenwriter Mark Medoff while attending a youth drama camp, and was subsequently cast for the film Clara's Heart (1988). 
An amateur magician, he has performed tricks on late-night shows hosted by David Letterman, Jay Leno and Carson Daly. 
Sought to distance himself from Doogie Howser-like roles. "I'm trying to break free of wholesome, of 'smile, show your teeth, be a nice good boy' and try to be more mysterious, sexual, warped," he told the New York Times in 1997. 
Has always been partial to live theater because, as he told Newsday in 2004, "It's just more challenging, more legit." Made his Broadway debut in 2002 in Proof. 
As a stage performer, was recognized as a superlative interpreter of Stephen Sondheim, winning acclaim as the balladeer in the 2004 production of Assassins.Neil Patrick Harris Relationships: David Burtka - Significant OtherGideon Scott - SonHarper Grace - DaughterBrian Harris - BrotherRon Harris - FatherSheila Harris - MotherNeil Patrick Harris Awards: 2011 People's Choice Awards:  Favorite TV Comedy Actor - Winner2009 Emmy:  Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series - Nominee2012 People's Choice Awards:  Favorite TV Comedy Actor - Winner2008 Emmy:  Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series - Nominee2013 Emmy:  Outstanding Special Class Program - Winner2009 Golden Globe:  Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television - Nominee1992 Golden Globe:  Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy - Nominee2010 Golden Globe:  Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television - Nominee1989 Golden Globe:  Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture - Nominee1990 People's Choice Awards:  Favorite Male Performer in a New TV Series - Winner2012 Emmy:  Outstanding Special Class Programs - Winner2010 Emmy:  Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series - Winner2010 Emmy:  Outstanding Special Class Program - Winner2014 Tony:  Actor (Musical) - Nominee2007 Emmy:  Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series - Nominee2010 Emmy:  Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series - Nominee
