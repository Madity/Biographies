Cedric Bixler-Zavala (born November 4, 1974 in Redwood City, California) is a Grammy Award-winning American musician known for his work as frontman and lyricist of the progressive rock band The Mars Volta, and as frontman and occasional guitarist of the post-hardcore group At the Drive-In. Currently he is a singer in the band Antemasque, and also sings and plays guitar in his band Zavalaz. He has also played drums for a number of acts, including the dub act De Facto and more recently Big Sir and Anywhere.
Bixler-Zavala has a High Tenor vocal range, spanning from the G above Low C (G3) to Soprano C (C6). His vocal work for At the Drive-In consisted mainly of a screaming style.
Bixler-Zavala is fond of Frank Zappaesque humour and writes in English, Spanish, and Latin. “I love to take common sayings, pervert them, mutate them a little. So you think I am singing one thing, but when you read it, it is different.”[1]
When performing with At the Drive-in and The Mars Volta, Bixler-Zavala was known for his eccentric on-stage behavior. He frequently did somersaults on stage, swung his microphone (once unintentionally hitting band mate Ikey Owens in the head), threw objects such as cymbals, microphone stands, and trash cans into the audience, salsa danced, adjusted Omar Rodriguez-Lopez’s effects pedals and occasionally played the maracas.
Under the pseudonym "Alavaz Relxib Cirdec" ("Cedric Bixler-Zavala" backwards), Bixler-Zavala contributed a two-song single to the GSL Special 12" Singles Series, released in December 2005. Closer to the dub of De Facto and the ambient experimentation shown in Omar Rodríguez-López's records than the prog-rock of The Mars Volta, the two songs Bixler-Zavala has produced under this alias are entirely instrumental.
This is my failed attempt at ghost noted shuffeling Tony Allen beats! Ha! There is a digital tabla machine running through some DD-5 delay pedal that is being played by a mini hand held tape recorder playing throughout! I wrote the bass line...hummed it to Juan...Omar came up with the guitar and chorus section and Adrian played flute on it. It was squeezed in during tracking drums for Amputechture, and rushed...very very rushed. I had other parts and chorus bits but I didn't want to get in the way of the record (studio time is expensive!). The samples are from 2 places [...] On "Private Booths" the samples at the start are from a interview with a psychic who participated in the Montauk Project...I sampled it from a UK TV show called Disinformation (RIP!) [...] The other sample is from a movie called Shock Corridor by the late Sam Fuller. Side 2 "Sapta Loka" is a bit of an homage to ambient German music from the 70's....it's one long drone spliced in four places and stacked on each other playing at the same time. A shitty Casio and a banged up Chaos pad (very 2005!) are being run and it's all recorded through a hand held mini recorder dumped onto a ProTools file. [...] Omar co-wrote the piece.
Late 2011 saw the release of the first 7" record from Bixler's new project Anywhere, a collaboration with Christian Eric Beaulieu of Triclops! and Mike Watt of The Stooges/Firehose/Minutemen.[2] Their self-titled debut album was released by ATP Records in June 2012.
Bixler has stated that he has been working on an album with the last Mars Volta drummer Deantoni Parks, although it remains unreleased to date.[3]
Since 2011 Bixler was working on another album, which he described as "mostly ballady type stuff...a very sunday morning record. Very soft".[4] Eventually the solo project turned into a full-fledged band named Zavalaz, which features Bixler on lead vocals and guitar, Dan Elkan on guitar, Juan Alderete on bass and Gregory Rogove on drums. The band is set to play a number of West Coast tour dates throughout June, supported by Dot Hacker and EV Kain.[5] On June 3, 2013, a snippet from song "Blue Rose of Grand Street" off their upcoming album All the Nights We Never Met was released on YouTube.[6]
Cedric has been back into the studio after reuniting with Omar Rodriquez-Lopez due to Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist, Flea, wanting them to reunite. They have now formed a supergroup together called Antemasque with ex-Mars Volta drummer Dave Elitch. Recording new material and new a new album to be released in 2014. Fans have cited that as Flea & Dave have played with the Mars Volta prior, a Mars Volta reunion could be in the works. (Flea played bass on 2002's De-loused in the Comatorium and trumpet on 2004's Frances the Mute, Dave played with The Mars Volta from 2009-2010)
In 2009 Bixler-Zavala married actress and model Chrissie Carnell. The couple reside in Los Angeles, California. They had their first children, twin boys Ulysses Nakai and Xanthus Lucien, in 2013.
Cedric's life has been heavily impacted by the deaths of people who have been in close association with him, several of which have become themes for his lyrics. Jimmy Hernandez, bass player for Los Dregtones, died of cancer in 1994. Bernie Rincon, an original drummer of At The Drive-In, committed suicide.[7] In 1996, two of his bandmates of the group The Fall on Deaf Ears, Laura Beard and Sarah Reiser, died in a car accident.[8] Also in 1996, a close friend and band-mate of Cedric's named Julio Venegas committed suicide. The story behind The Mars Volta's first album De-Loused in the Comatorium was loosely inspired by "life and death of Julio Venegas". Shortly before the release of De-Loused, in May 2003, their sound manipulator and longtime friend of Cedric and Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, Jeremy Michael Ward, was found dead of apparent heroin overdose.[9] Ward coined the term Amputechture which was used as the title for The Mars Volta's third full-length album, and Frances the Mute was based on a journal Ward had discovered.[10]

Cedric Bixler Zavala’s Biography – Free listening, videos, concerts, stats and pictures at Last.fm
Cedric Bixler-Zavala (born November 4, 1974 in Redwood City, CA) is the lead singer and lyricist of The Mars Volta, and was previously the lead singer and lyricist of At the Drive-In. He is frequently linked with close friend and collaborator Omar Rodriguez-Lopez.
While with At the Drive-In, Cedric’s vocals were often shouted or screamed. For his work with The Mars Volta, Cedric has largely given up the emotive shouted vocals of his youth in favor of melismatic singing the higher register. At some points he approaches the whistle register. He is also notable for experimenting heavily with vocal effects, causing him to sound as if he’s singing through a telephone, underwater, or with a mechanical voice box. Omar Rodriguez-Lopez even commented that the amount of distortion on Cedric’s voice in The Mars Volta precludes their need for a rhythm guitarist.
Cedric’s lyrics are often abstruse to the point of seeming nonsensical. These lyrics often blend contrasting metaphors, usually dealing with grotesque, speculative fiction imagery. He has cited a variety of influences, such as Werner Herzog, Luis Bunuel, Neu!, Doctor Who, and Mexican folk tales. Commonly recurring motifs in his work are skin grafts, Jet lag and lepers. He has also experimented with bilingual lyrics, switching from English to Spanish several times within the course of a song. The Mars Volta’s critically acclaimed album De-Loused in the Comatorium was accompanied by a short novel of the same name, written in the same metaphorical style his lyrics are arranged by Cedric and Jeremy Ward.
Multi-talented, Cedric also performed guitar with At the Drive-In and drums and occasionally bass with experimental reggae-dub group Defacto. Under the pseudonym “Alavaz Relxib Cirdec”, Bixler-Zavala contributed a 2-song single to the Gold Standard Labs Special 12” Single Series, released in December 2005.
