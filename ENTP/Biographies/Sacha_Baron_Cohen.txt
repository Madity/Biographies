=======================================================
Sacha Noam Baron Cohen[3] (born 13 October 1971) is an English comedic actor, writer, and voice actor. A graduate of Christ's College, Cambridge (a constituent college of the University of Cambridge),[4] Baron Cohen is most widely known for creating and playing four fictional characters: Ali G, Borat Sagdiyev, Brüno Gehard and Admiral General Aladeen. In most of his routines, Baron Cohen's characters interact with unsuspecting people who do not realise they are being set up for comic situations and self-revealing ridicule.
Baron Cohen was named Best Newcomer at the 1999 British Comedy Awards for The 11 O'Clock Show, and since then, his work has been further recognised with two BAFTA Awards for Da Ali G Show, several Emmy nominations, a nomination for an Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay, and a Golden Globe for Best Actor for his work in the feature film Borat. After the release of Borat, Baron Cohen stated that because the public had become too familiar with the characters, he would retire Borat and Ali G.[5] Similarly, after the release of Brüno, Baron Cohen stated he would also retire the title character.[6] At the 2012 British Comedy Awards, he received the Outstanding Achievement Award, accepting the award while reprising his Ali G character.[7] In 2013, he received the BAFTA Charlie Chaplin Britannia Award for Excellence in Comedy.[8]
The middle of three brothers, Baron Cohen was born in Hammersmith, West London. His mother, Daniella Naomi (née Weiser), who worked as a movement instructor, was born in Israel.[9] His father, Gerald Baron Cohen, a clothing store owner, was born in London, and raised in Wales.[10][11] Baron Cohen was raised Jewish.[12] His father's family were Eastern European Jews who moved to Pontypridd, Wales, and London, England, and his mother's family were German Jews.[9] His paternal grandfather, Morris Cohen, had added "Baron" to his surname.[11][13] His maternal grandmother, who lives in Haifa, Israel, trained as a ballet dancer in Germany.[10][14][15][16] He has two brothers: Erran and Amnon.[17] Erran is a composer and has worked on several of Sacha's films. Baron Cohen's cousin, Simon, is an internationally renowned autism researcher.[18]
Baron Cohen attended Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, a private school in Elstree, Hertfordshire, north of London.[19] He went on to the University of Cambridge, entering Christ's College, Cambridge, where he read history.[20] While attending the Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club, Baron Cohen acted in the plays Fiddler on the Roof and Cyrano de Bergerac, and performed in Habonim Dror Jewish theatre performances.[21]
After leaving university, Baron Cohen worked for a time as a fashion model, appearing in many fashion magazines.[21] By the early 1990s, he was hosting a weekly programme on Windsor cable television's local broadcasts with Carol Kirkwood, who later became a BBC weather forecaster. In 1995, Channel 4 was planning a replacement for its series The Word, and disseminated an open call for new television presenters. Baron Cohen sent in a tape of himself in the character of Kristo, a fictional television reporter (who developed into the Kazakh Borat Sagdiyev), which caught the attention of a producer. Baron Cohen hosted Pump TV from 1995–1996. In 1996, he began presenting the youth chat programme F2F for Granada Talk TV. He took clown training in Paris, at the Ecole Philippe Gaulier, studying under master-clown Philippe Gaulier. Of his former pupil, Gaulier says: "He was a good clown, full of spirit".[22] In the late 1990s, Baron Cohen made his first feature film appearance in the British comedy The Jolly Boys' Last Stand. In 2000, Baron Cohen played the part of Super Greg for a series of TV advertisements for Lee Jeans; the advertisements never aired but the website for Super Greg created an internet sensation.[23]
Baron Cohen as Ali G, offering a speech at Harvard University's Class Day during Commencement ceremonies
Baron Cohen appeared during two-minute sketches as his fashion reporter Brüno on the Paramount Comedy Channel during 1998. He shot to fame when his comic character Ali G, an uneducated, boorish junglist, hailing from Staines (a suburban town in Surrey, to the west of London), started appearing on the British television show The 11 O'Clock Show on Channel 4, which first went to air 8 September 1998. A year after the première of the show, GQ named him comedian of the year.[24] He won Best Newcomer at the 1999 British Comedy Awards, and was nominated for Best British Entertainment Performance at the British Academy Television Awards.[24]
Da Ali G Show began in 2000, and won the BAFTA for Best Comedy in the following year.[25] Also in 2000, Baron Cohen as Ali G appeared as the limousine driver in Madonna's 2000 video "Music", directed by Jonas Åkerlund, who was also responsible for directing the titles for Da Ali G Show.
In 2002, Ali G was the central character in the feature film Ali G Indahouse, in which he is elected to the British Parliament and foils a plot to bulldoze a community centre in his home town, Staines.[26] His television show was exported to the United States in 2003, with new episodes set there, for HBO.
At the 2012 British Comedy Awards, thirteen years after winning Best Newcomer at the 1999 Comedy Awards, Baron Cohen accepted the Outstanding Achievement Award from Sir Ben Kingsley in the guise of Ali G, and stated: "I is grown up now. I ain't living in my nan's house anymore. I is living in her garage".[7]
Ali G's interviews with celebrities (often politicians) gained notoriety partly because the subjects were not privy to the joke that Ali G, rather than being a real interviewer, was a comic character played by Baron Cohen. According to Rolling Stone magazine, Baron Cohen would always enter the interview area in character as Ali G, carrying equipment and appearing to be an insignificant crew member. He would arrive with a suited man, whom the interviewee naturally thought was the interviewer. Baron Cohen, as Ali G, would sit down to begin conducting the interview by asking the interviewee some preliminary questions. The interviewee, however, would remain under the impression that the smartly-dressed director would be conducting the interview until short notice prior to cameras rolling: this would grant an advantage of surprise, whereby the interviewee would be less likely to opt out of the Ali interview prior to its start.[27]
The resulting willingness of Baron Cohen's targets to answer his frequently risqué questions often created surprising conversations. Interviewees have included:
basketball players Dwyane Wade, Shaquille O'Neal, Steve Nash, Kobe Bryant, Richard Jefferson, Tim Duncan, Ben Wallace and Robert Horry
former UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali (whom Baron Cohen, in his Ali G character, referred to as 'Boutros Boutros Boutros-Ghali')
Baron Cohen is a supporter of Comic Relief and as Ali G has hosted some interviews for the benefit of the charity.[28]
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, a feature film with Borat at the centre, was screened at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival and released in the United Kingdom on 2 November 2006, in the United States on 3 November 2006 and Australia 23 November 2006. The film is about a journey across the United States in an ice cream truck, in which the main character is obsessed with the idea of marrying Pamela Anderson. The film is a mockumentary which includes interviews with various American citizens that poke fun at American culture, as well as sexism, racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, and jingoism.
It debuted at the #1 spot in the US, taking in an estimated $26.4 million in just 837 theatres averaging $31,600 per theatre, the fourth highest per-theatre average of all time for movies opening wide (500 screens or more), behind Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Spider-Man 3.
Baron Cohen won the 2007 Golden Globe in the "Best Actor – Musical or Comedy" category, his sixth such award. Although Borat was up for "Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy", the film lost to Dreamgirls. On 23 January 2007, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. He shared his nomination with the film's co-writers, Ant Hines, Peter Baynham, Sy Mordecai Finesto, Dan Mazer, and Todd Phillips.
Aside from the comic elements of his characters, Baron Cohen's performances are interpreted by some as reflecting uncomfortable truths about his audience. He juxtaposes his own Jewish lineage with the anti-Semitism of his character Borat.[29]
In 2007, Baron Cohen published a travel guide as Borat, with dual titles: Borat: Touristic Guidings To Minor Nation of U.S. and A. and Borat: Touristic Guidings To Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.[30]
Another alter ego Sacha Baron Cohen performed as is 'Brüno', a flamboyantly gay, Austrian fashion show presenter who often lures his unwitting subjects into making provocative statements and engaging in embarrassing behaviour, as well as leading them to contradict themselves, often in the same interview. Brüno asks the subjects to answer "yes or no" questions with either "Vassup" (what's up) or "Ich don't think so" (No); these are occasionally substituted with "Ach, ja!" (Ah yes!) or "Nicht, nicht" ("Nicht" means "not" in German). In one segment on Da Ali G Show, he encouraged his guest to answer questions with either "Keep them in the ghetto" or "Train to Auschwitz".
Brüno's main comedic satire pertains to the vacuity and inanity of the fashion and clubbing world. In May 2009, at the MTV Movie Awards, Baron Cohen appeared as Brüno wearing a white angel costume, a white jockstrap, white go-go boots, and white wings; and did an aerial stunt where he dropped from a height (using wires) onto Eminem. Baron Cohen landed with his face on Eminem's crotch, with his crotch in Eminem's face, prompting Eminem to exit the venue with fellow rappers D12. Eminem later admitted to staging the stunt with Baron Cohen.[32] After an intense bidding war that included such Hollywood powerhouses as DreamWorks, Sony, and 20th Century Fox, Universal Pictures won and paid a reported $42.5 million for the film rights.[33] A number of shill companies and websites were created in order to draw potential interviewees into interviews by creating an illusion of legitimacy.[34] The film was released in July 2009.
Baron Cohen's 2012 film, The Dictator, was described by its press as "the heroic story of a dictator who risked his life to ensure that democracy would never come to the country he so lovingly oppressed".[35] Baron Cohen played Admiral General Aladeen, a dictator from a fictional country called the Republic of Wadiya.[36][37] Borat and Bruno film director Larry Charles directed the film.[38] The main target of the film's satire was Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, who was still alive when the film was written.[39] The producers of the film were concerned it would anger Gaddafi, possibly even resulting in a terrorist attack, so they released deliberate misinformation saying that the film was loosely based on a romance novel written by former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.[39]
On 26 February 2012, Baron Cohen was allegedly banned from attending the 84th Academy Awards in his role as Admiral General Aladeen but the rumour was denied by the Academy, saying "we haven't banned him. We're just waiting to hear what he's going to do" but made it clear that "Cohen is not welcome to use the red carpet as a platform for a promotional stunt".[40] Cohen eventually appeared at the awards' red carpet with a pair of uniformed female bodyguards, holding an urn which he claimed was filled with the ashes of Kim Jong-il. The "ashes", which Baron Cohen admitted to Howard Stern on the Tuesday, 8 May 2012 episode of The Howard Stern Show were flour, were "accidentally" spilled onto Ryan Seacrest.
In an interview with former British MP Neil Hamilton in 2000, Ali G offered Hamilton what was allegedly cannabis, which Hamilton accepted and smoked, creating some minor controversy in the British media.[41]
At the 2006 MTV Movie Awards, Borat introduced Gnarls Barkley's performance of "Crazy", where he made a comment about Jessica Simpson, saying that he liked her mouth and that he could see it clearly through her denim pants.[citation needed]
At the 2006 UK premiere of Borat, he arrived in Leicester Square in a cart pulled by a mule and a number of "Kazakh women", announcing: "Good evening, gentleman and prostitutes. After this I stay in a hotel in Kings Cross. We will all drink, wrestle with no clothes on and shoot dogs from the window."[42]
Baron Cohen has been criticized for the racist or prejudiced comments his characters have made (see Da Ali G Show). HBO spokesman Quentin Schaffer has replied to criticism concerning Baron Cohen's characters, "Through his alter-egos, he delivers an obvious satire that exposes people's ignorance and prejudice in much the same way All in the Family did years ago."[43] Regarding his portrayal as the anti-Semitic Borat, Baron Cohen says the segments are a "dramatic demonstration of how racism feeds on dumb conformity, as much as rabid bigotry", rather than a display of racism by Baron Cohen himself.[44] "Borat essentially works as a tool. By himself being anti-Semitic, he lets people lower their guard and expose their own prejudice", Baron Cohen explains.[15] Addressing the same topic in an NPR interview with Robert Siegel, Baron Cohen says "...and I think that's quite an interesting thing with Borat, which is people really let down their guard with him because they're in a room with somebody who seems to have these outrageous opinions. They sometimes feel much more relaxed about letting their own outrageous, politically incorrect, prejudiced opinions come out."[45]
Baron Cohen, the grandson of a Holocaust survivor, says he also wishes in particular to expose the role of indifference in that genocide. "When I was in university, there was this major historian of the Third Reich, Ian Kershaw, who said, 'The path to Auschwitz was paved with indifference.' I know it's not very funny being a comedian talking about the Holocaust, but it's an interesting idea that not everyone in Germany had to be a raving anti-Semite. They just had to be apathetic."[15] Regarding the enthusiastic response to his song, "In My Country There Is Problem" (also known as "Throw the Jew Down the Well"), he says, "Did it reveal that they were anti-Semitic? Perhaps. But maybe it just revealed that they were indifferent to anti-Semitism."[15]
Baron Cohen walked onto the runway during the Ágatha Ruiz de la Prada fashion show in Milan on 26 September 2008. In the character of one of his alter-egos Brüno, he was wearing a costume made out of velcro. He appeared on the stage with a blanket and items of clothing stuck to his velcro suit. Lights were turned off while security intervened and escorted him off the stage, and the fashion show resumed normally shortly thereafter. Baron Cohen and his team allegedly accessed the fashion show using fake IDs.[46]
During an appearance on Late Show with David Letterman,[when?] Baron Cohen stated he was restricted from answering David Letterman's question as to how he managed to get an interview with Pat Buchanan while in character as Ali G due to pending "legal reasons".[47]
Baron Cohen guest-starred in the fifth season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, with Dustin Hoffman as a guide to Heaven. He also provided the voice of the ring-tailed lemur king, King Julien, in DreamWorks Animation's film series, Madagascar, and appeared as Will Ferrell's arch rival the French Formula One speed demon Jean Girard in the 2006 hit Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. He also appeared alongside Johnny Depp in the 2007 film Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street as Signor Adolfo Pirelli, co-starred in Martin Scorsese's 2011 adventure film Hugo, and portrayed Thénardier in the 2012 film version of the musical Les Misérables.
Baron Cohen tends to avoid doing interviews out of character. However, in 2004, he did the talk show circuit appearing as himself on Late Show with David Letterman, The Opie and Anthony Show, The Howard Stern Show,[48] and others in order to promote the upcoming season of his show on HBO. He was also interviewed on NPR's All Things Considered.[45] He also did an interview with Rolling Stone, published in November 2006, that the magazine labelled as "his only interview as himself".[15] He also appeared in an interview out of character with Terry Gross on NPR's Fresh Air on 4 January 2007.[49]
Baron Cohen has twice presented the MTV Europe Music Awards, first as Ali G on 8 November 2001, in Frankfurt, Germany, and then as Borat on 3 November 2005 in Lisbon, Portugal. Baron Cohen appeared out of character to accept an award at the British Comedy Awards in December 2006. He said at the time that Borat could not make it to the awards as "he's guest of honour at the Holocaust denial conference in Tehran",[50] referring to the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust.
Borat director Larry Charles explains that Baron Cohen generally appears in character partly to "protect his weakness", by focusing public interest on his characters rather than himself.[51] His other reason, Newsweek claims, is that Baron Cohen is fiercely private: "...according to the UK press, his publicists denied not only that he attended a party for the London premiere of Borat, but also that a party even occurred."[51]
In September 2010, representatives for Cohen confirmed that he would be playing Freddie Mercury in a biopic about the rock singer.[52][53] He dropped out of the project in July 2013, citing "creative differences" between him and the surviving members of Queen.[54] Queen guitarist Brian May later said they felt Cohen's presence would be "distracting".[55]
Baron Cohen shot a spread with supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio for Marie Claire magazine to promote the film Brüno.[56]
Sports Illustrated's 6 November 2006 issue contains a column called "Skater vs. Instigator", which illustrates various amusing "parallels" between Baron Cohen and figure skater Sasha Cohen, ranging from their mutually held personal significance of the number 4,[57] to their mutual romantic interests in redheads.
In 2010, Cohen guest-starred on The Simpsons in the episode "The Greatest Story Ever D'ohed" as Jakob, a quick-tempered Israeli tour guide.
Baron Cohen first met actress Isla Fisher in 2002 at a party in Sydney, Australia.[59] The couple became engaged in 2004, and married on 15 March 2010 in Paris, France.[60][61] Prior to their marriage, Fisher converted to Judaism, in early 2007, after three years of study.[62] Fisher also received the approval of Baron Cohen's observant Jewish parents.[63] Baron Cohen and Fisher have two daughters: Olive, born in October 2007 in Los Angeles,[64] and Elula Lottie Miriam, born in August 2010.[65]
The government of Kazakhstan threatened Baron Cohen with legal action following the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony in Lisbon, and the authority in charge of the country's country-code top-level domain name removed the website that he had created for his character Borat (previously: http://www.borat.kz) for alleged violation of the law—specifically, registering for the domain under a false name. The New York Times, among others, has reported that Baron Cohen (in character as Borat) replied: "I'd like to state that I have no connection with Mr. Cohen and fully support my government decision to sue this Jew".[66] He was, however, defended by Dariga Nazarbayeva, a politician and the daughter of Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who stated, "We should not be afraid of humour and we shouldn't try to control everything..."[67] The deputy foreign minister of Kazakhstan later invited Baron Cohen to visit the country, stating that he could learn that "women drive cars, wine is made of grapes, and Jews are free to go to synagogues".[68] After the worldwide success of the Borat film, the Kazakh government, including the president, altered their stance on Baron Cohen's parody, tacitly recognising the invaluable press coverage the controversy created for their country.[69]
Baron Cohen encountered another problem around his Borat character. Two of the three University of South Carolina students who appear in Borat sued the filmmakers, alleging that they were duped into signing release forms while drunk, and that false promises were made that the footage was for a documentary that would never be screened in the US. On 11 December 2006, a Los Angeles judge denied the pair a restraining order to remove them from the film. The lawsuit was dismissed in February 2007.[70]
On 22 May 2009, a charity worker at a seniors' bingo game sued Baron Cohen, claiming an incident shot for Brüno at a charity bingo tournament left her disabled.[71] However, the worker later retracted her statement, saying the "actor never struck her", but that he "beat her down emotionally to the point she's now confined to a wheelchair".[72] The scene did not make the final cut for the film. The case was dismissed in late November 2009 on Anti-SLAPP grounds with all attorney's fees to be paid by the charity worker. The dismissal was appealed and upheld on 12 September 2011.[73]
A lawsuit was filed on 30 April 2010 in the District of Columbia by Palestinian Christian Ayman Abu Aita of Beit Sahour, Bethlehem, West Bank, against Baron Cohen relating to his interview which was used in Brüno. Aita alleges that he has been defamed by false accusations that he is a terrorist. Aita included David Letterman in the suit based on comments made during the 7 July 2009 appearance by Baron Cohen on the Late Show with David Letterman.[74] On 4 November 2010, the D.C. case was dismissed with Aita given 120 days to file in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York or have the case permanently dismissed.[75] The case was re-filed in the Supreme Court of New York.[76]
Baron Cohen first acted in theatrical productions featuring the Socialist-Zionist youth movement Habonim Dror.[77]
He spent a year in Israel volunteering at Kibbutz Rosh HaNikra and Kibbutz Beit HaEmek as part of the Shnat Habonim Dror, as well as taking part in the programme Machon L'Madrichei Chutz La'Aretz for Jewish youth movement leaders.
According to Baron Cohen, "I wouldn't say I am a religious Jew. I am proud of my Jewish identity and there are certain things I do and customs I keep." He tries to keep kosher and attends synagogue about twice a year.[78]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          British actor and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen was born in Hammersmith, London. He is the son of Daniella (Weiser), an Israeli-born movement instructor, and Gerald Baron Cohen, an England-born, Wales-raised, clothing store owner. His father is of Eastern European Jewish descent, and his mother is of German Jewish descent. He was educated at a private school, Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School in Hertfordshire, and went on to read History at Christ's College, Cambridge. Baron Cohen had an interest in performing from an early age, forming a breakdancing group as a teenager and acting in amateur plays with a Jewish youth group. While at university he joined the Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club, and took part in such plays as "Cyrano de Bergerac" and "Fiddler on the Roof".Upon leaving University, Baron Cohen briefly worked as a model, before moving on to work as a host on a satellite TV station. In 1995, Channel 4 put out an open call for new presenters, and Baron Cohen sent in a tape featuring himself in character as an Albania TV reporter (an early prototype for Borat). He was hired and worked on various 'youth TV' projects before, in 1998, appearing in The 11 O'Clock Show (1998) which became a cult hit thanks to his character, Ali G. Ali G proved so popular that a spin-off show Da Ali G Show (2000) and film Ali G Indahouse (2002) where produced.America soon beckoned with a stateside version of Da Ali G Show. Feature film work followed with Baron Cohen providing the voice of Julien in Madagascar (2005) and appearing as Jean Girard alongside Will Ferrell in Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006). He followed this with the smash-hit Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006), for which he won a Golden Globe and was nominated for a writing Oscar. Other projects include Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), Brüno (2009) and Hugo (2011).
      He was voted Personality of the year at the TV Quick awards in London, England, UK. [September 2000]
      In contrast to his characters, he is a soft-spoken, gentlemanly Cambridge man who considered pursuing a PhD before going into comedy.
      He plays three principal characters on Da Ali G Show (2003). The title character is Ali G, a lower-class white male who acts like a Jamaican Londoner and enrages his politically active and powerful guests with stupid questions. Another one is the Kazakhstani TV reporter Borat, who naïvely searches for porn and outlets for his scatological, accidental humor and anti-Semitism. The last one is the superficial Austrian fashion expert Brüno, who often talks up heartless fashionistas and makes macho men uncomfortable with his blatant homosexuality.
      Appears on talk shows in character; he has rarely appeared as his real self. Nevertheless, he did appear as himself on the Golden Globe Awards show in 2007, as well as on the NPR radio talk show "Fresh Air" with Terry Gross. He was also asked to appear in character (as Borat) at the Oscars, but refused and went as himself.
      His uncle, Simon Baron-Cohen, is a preeminent psychologist who became famous for his theory that autism is caused by an extreme male brain.
      Went to Haberdashers' Aske's School for Boys in Hertfordshire, the same school as broadcaster Alan Whicker, Little Britain (2003) star Matt Lucas, comedian David Baddiel, and former Formula 1 champion Damon Hill.
      For Borat, Sacha takes about 6 weeks to grow body, head, and facial hair. For Ali G., the facial hair takes about 4 weeks to grow. When preparing for Brüno, he shaves all of his hair (including body hair), and works out and cleans his body vigorously.
      During an "All Things Considered" interview in 2004, Baron Cohen told NPR's Robert Siegel that he wrote his Cambridge thesis on Jewish involvement in the U.S. Civil Rights movement, focusing especially on the 1964 murders of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner in Philadelphia, Mississippi.
      Putting a rest to Ali G and Borat, the anti-Semitic Khazakh. He said to British newspaper "Friday," "I was in character sometimes 14 hours a day, and I came to love them, so admitting I am never going to play them again is quite a sad thing.". [December 2007]
      Attended the Bruno Premiere (in full character) at Tuschinski Theatre on June 20th in Amsterdam, Netherlands. [June 2009]
      His paternal grandparents, Morris Cohen and Miriam Nichelby, were from Eastern European Jewish families that moved to Wales and England. His maternal grandparents, Hans Weiser and Leisel Levi, were both German Jews.
      Borat is based actually on a guy I met in southern Russia. I can't remember his name. He was a doctor. The moment I met him I was totally crying. He was a hysterically funny guy, albeit totally unintentionally.
      I remember, when I was in university I studied history, and there was this one major historian of the Third Reich, Ian Kershaw. And his quote was, 'The path to Auschwitz was paved with indifference.' I know it's not very funny being a comedian talking about the Holocaust, but I think it's an interesting idea that not everyone in Germany had to be a raving anti-Semite. They just had to be apathetic.
      I've been in a bizarre situation, where a country has declared me as its number-one enemy. It's inherently a comic situation. I mean, it's always risky when you don't go down the normal route. I wish I would've been there at the briefing that Bush got about who I am, who Borat is. It would have had to be great.
      I think that, essentially, I'm a private person, and to reconcile that with being famous is a hard thing. So I've been trying to have my cake and eat it too - to have my character be famous yet still lead a normal life where I'm not trapped by fame and recognizability...I guess I've been greedy. Maybe it's time to let go.
      It's wonderful that the films are successful, but every new person who sees the movie is one less person I can be Borat or Bruno with again, so finishing a movie means having to say goodbye. Admitting that you're never going to play the character again is like saying goodbye to a loved one. And that's hard.
      [on a scene in 'Hugo') So I have a bath with the dog. What happens under the bubbles is our business.
      It seems to me that Marty (Scorsese) makes films for himself. He is an artist. And he's one of the last remaining artists out there, and I think we should respect that.

                Sacha Noam Baron Cohen was the youngest of three sons. He was brought up as an Orthodox Jew - passed on from his mother's family who originate from Israel. His upbringing was more than comfortable as he was rewarded with a high standard of living and the best education. He attended the reputable Haberdasher-Askes Boys’ School, where fellow Jewish comedians David Baddiel and Matt Lucas were also were pupils. Cohen joined the Habonim Jewish Youth Group in 1989 and spent a year in Israel learning more about his faith. On his return he headed off to study history at Christ's College, Cambridge where he joined the university's amateur dramatic club. Acting in plays such as Cyrano de Bergerac and Fiddler on the Roof ignited a passion for acting and while he worked towards his history degree, he also kept one eye firmly focused on his hobby. After graduating, Cohen hosted a weekly programme on a cable television network but was fired for broadcasting a lewd presentation for Valentine's Day - a glimmer of his future to come perhaps. However it was to be a moment of fate in 1995 that would transform Cohen's fortunes. Channel 4 was planning a replacement for its cult series The Word, and sent out an open call for new television presenters. Cohen responded, sending in a tape of himself in the character of Kristo, a fictional television reporter from Albania (who eventually became the Kazakhstani Borat), which caught the attention of a producer and from there, he was hired as a regular on the newly commissioned 11 O'Clock Show. Soon the character of Ali G was born and became the star attraction of the TV programme, thanks to Cohen's trademark of embarrassing interviewers and his brash send-up of street lingo. Winning Best Newcomer at the British Comedy Awards in 1999 gave Cohen the ticket to branch out alone with his own programme, Da Ali G Show in 2000. Cohen's interviews as Ali G became notorious across the nation, with him receiving many accolades including a BAFTA for Best Comedy and even appearing in Madonna's video for her single, Music. The character gained notoriety because the targets of his humour were always unaware of the joke and believed Ali G to be a real interviewer. Cohen loved to put his subjects on the spot with risque questions and the joke would continue as they either became increasingly uncomfortable or instead let the conversation take an unexpected turn. Leading figures Cohen interviewed as Ali G have included Buzz Aldrin, Tony Benn, Mohamed Al-Fayed and Donald Trump.For Cohen, his alter ego had proved to be more than just a comedic vehicle - it was the beginning of a prosperous career. To ellaborate on his comedy skills, Cohen soon wheeled out another tongue-in-cheek character to counteract Ali G's fans- Borat. Borat had in fact first been created by Cohen back in 1997 but he thought the time was now right to develop the character further as he had established himself at the helm of his own television series. Borat's Kazakhstan heritage gave Cohen a wide berth to poke fun at the nation with his racist jokes, stemming from the fact Borat is the son of the village rapist, his mother being only nine when she gave birth to him! These clever Cohen details would see Borat's fame rise as high, if not higher than Ali G's yet resulting in some problems for him further down the line. Both Ali G and Borat soon crossed the Atlantic where Da Ali G Show appeared on American cable television in 2003. The act went down well in the USA but Cohen's first feature film Ali G Indahouse (2002) was only released in the UK. Cohen's time in the USA was not wasted though as Dreamworks picked up on his talents and he leant his voice to the animation Madagascar in 2005. With Ali G taking a back seat for a while, it was to be Borat who kept Cohen's light burning with the release to the big screen of Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan in 2006. The hysterical ‘mockumentary’ followed the crude and backwards Borat on a trip to the United States with most of the events and people depicted in the film being real. Many of the dupes reported later that they were completely convinced they were talking to a Kazakh journalist. Prior to the film’s release, Cohen lobbied the public in true politician style (as Borat) on the campaign trail, appearing on any talk shows that would have him including The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and The Late Show with David Letterman. The film was a huge box office success, hitting the number on spot in the US. Cohen won the Golden Globe for Best Actor - Musical or Comedy, while the film was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy Golden Globe and Best Adapted Screenplay Academy Award. Not a stranger to public controversies, Cohen had continued to garner troubles from the early days of Ali G because of racist or prejudiced comments he made while in character. One such entity to not see the funny side of Cohen's joke was Kazakhstan - the country in which Cohen had earned a fortune taking the pee out off as Borat. In reaction to his sexist, racist slurs, the Kazakhstan government responded in 2005 by threatening to take legal action over comments made while Cohen was hosting the MTV Europe Music Awards in character as Borat. Not one to pass up the opportunity to create another comedic moment, Cohen responded to the legal threat by posting a video on his website in character as Borat saying, "I'd like to state that I have no connection with Mr. Cohen and fully support my government decision to sue this Jew. Kazakhstan is as civilized as any other country in the world. Women can now travel on inside of bus, homosexuals no longer have to wear blue hats and age of consent has been raised to eight years old."Cohen was, however, recently defended by Dariga Nazarbayeva, a politician and the daughter of Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who said “we should not be afraid of humour and we shouldn't try to control everything, I think.” Cohen has often been confused with the identity of one of his characters and it is rare that the public ever gets to glimpse the real him. The little the media have been enticed with is his relationship with actress Isla Fisher, to whom he is engaged and their first baby, Olive, was born in October 2007. The pair met in 2002 and Cohen proposed two years later with talk of Fisher planning to convert to Judaism for a traditional Jewish ceremony. In 2007, Fisher converted to Judaism following three years of study and the couple married on 15 March 2010 in a traditional Jewish ceremony. Their second daughter Elula was born in the summer of the same year. The family were seen celebrating Cohen's 40th birthday in Sydney on 12 October 2011, with the couple keeping the identity of their children hidden while enjoying a boat trip. As a rule, Cohen rarely gives interviews as himself but he did embark on the talk show circuit back in 2004 to promote his series in America. Having seen both his creations, Ali G and Borat on the big screen, rumours began circulating that Cohen planned to put the spotlight onto his other character, Bruno. The gay Austrian fashion show presenter is a step away from both Ali G and Borat but follows the same parallel in subjecting his interviewees to provocative statements and embarrassing acts. It was reported Universal Pictures paid $42.5 million for the rights to the film.  In 2008, Cohen took to the runway at Prada's fashion show in Milan dressed as Bruno, with items stuck to his Velcro. He was soon escorted out by security. He also created a scene at the 2009 MTV Movie Awards when he descended from the ceiling, dressed as an angel upside down into Eminem's lap. Cohen only had a jockstrap on underneath his costume and ended up exposing his buttocks in the rapper's face who swore profusely and told his friends from D12 to remove him. It was later revealed they had planned the gag together. Next year, Cohen will be lending his voice to 'Madagascar 3' and playing the lead role in 'The Dictator', which is a loose adaptation of the novel Zabibah and the King written by Saddam Hussein. It tells the story of a dictator who lovingly oppressed his country to ensure democracy never came to it. Cohen plays the ruler who secretly gets replaced by a lookalike and flees to New York. He is also confirmed to be playing Freddie Mercury from Queen in a film portraying the band between 1971 and 1985.

Birth Name: Sacha Noam Baron CohenBirth Place: London, EnglandDate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 10/13/1971, LibraProfession: Actor; comedian; screenwriter
Grammatically challenged homeboy Ali G. Roving Kazakh reporter Borat. Gay Austrian fashionista Brüno. These hilariously broad, gloriously un-PC characters are the brainchildren of Britain-born Jewish writer and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. A soft-spoken, surprisingly handsome man in real life, this Cambridge-educated satirist introduced his signature alter ego, Ali G, on the British comedy series The 11 O'Clock Show in 1998. A stunningly misinformed "hip-hop journalist," Ali G conducted riotously inane interviews with unsuspecting public figures who believed they were talking to a real person. The gimmick proved so popular that Cohen earned his own series in England, Da Ali G Show, in 2000 and launched an American incarnation of the show on HBO in 2003, where his victims included Newt Gingrich, Ralph Nader, Andy Rooney and Gore Vidal. Cohen also introduced two other "journalists," Brüno and Borat, on these series. While Brüno's primary function seemed to be to make homophobes squirm, Borat managed to upset a number of different groups. Although Cohen caught some flak for Ali G — critics claimed the character was racist because he was a white boy acting "black" — Borat angered entire nations. The government of Kazakhstan, Borat's homeland, publicly objected to his character: a mustachioed misogynist and anti-Semite who liked to lead Americans in rousing choruses of "Throw the Jew Down the Well." And in 2005, under the guise of shooting a documentary, Cohen as Borat almost caused a riot when he said to the audience at a Virginia rodeo, "may George W. Bush drink the blood of every man, woman and child in Iraq," followed by a butchered rendition of the American national anthem. But Cohen's fans adored his in-character shenanigans. Indeed, Cohen often refused to appear as himself, preferring to travel the talk-show circuit as one of his alter egos, even hosting the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2005 as Borat. In 2006, Cohen became a bona-fide film star, winning a Golden Globe for his turn as Borat on the big screen in the smash hit Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. His screenplay for the film was also honored with an Oscar nod. While his follow-up film, 2009's Brüno, failed to garner any Oscar nominations, it did once again bring Cohen controversy. While promoting the film at the 2009 MTV Movie Awards, he did a stunt dressed as Brüno and appeared to seriously offend Eminem. Days later, Eminem admitted to being a willing participant in the gag. After the film was released, Cohen was sued by a Palestinian man who claimed he was falsely portrayed as a terrorist in the movie. Always up for a joke involving costumes, Cohen planned to appear as an Avatar character at the 2010 Oscars, but the show's producer nixed the spoof out of concern that it might offend director James Cameron. Off-screen, he's taken on the roles of husband and father, and his 2010 wedding to actress Isla Fisher in no way resembled one of his elaborate stunts. In contrast, it was a very private, traditional Jewish ceremony with only six guests in attendance.Sacha Baron Cohen Fast Facts:
Introduced the character of wannabe rapper-journalist Ali G on British TV comedy series The Eleven O'Clock Show in 1998, which eventually led to his Da Ali G Show.
Won BAFTA Awards for Best Comedy (Programme or Series) and Best Comedy Performance for Da Ali G Show in 2001. 
At the 2009 MTV Movie Awards, he appeared as a scantily clad Bruno and did an aerial stunt in which he landed on Eminem, who angrily left the building. Following days of speculation, Eminem admitted it was a gag they were both in on. 
In 2009, he was sued by a Palestinian man who claimed he was falsely portrayed as a terrorist in the movie Brüno; the man refiled the lawsuit in 2010. 
An Avatar spoof he planned for the 2010 Oscars was cut by the show's producer in order to avoid potentially offending James Cameron. 
After a six-year engagement, he wed actress Isla Fisher in a very private, traditional Jewish ceremony: only six guests were in attendance at their March 2010 nuptials in Paris.

Sacha Baron Cohen was born in London, England to Jewish parents Gerald and Daniella Baron Cohen. He went to private school, then studied history at Christ's College, Cambridge, where he began acting in plays at the Cambridge Footlights dramatic club.
His big break came in 1994, when a British TV station had an open call for a TV host. Baron Cohen made a tape of himself in character as an Albanian TV reporter (an early version of his character Borat). Although he didn't get the gig, he won the attention of a producer, who kept him in mind for future projects. 
In 1995, he appeared on the half hour comedy TV show Jack and Jeremy's Police 4, then debuted his character Ali G on Live from the Lighthouse (1998). Later that year, he became a household name, playing Ali G regularly on The 11 O'Clock Show for a season and winning the 1999 British Comedy Award as Best Male Comedy Newcomer. In 2000, he landed his own series, Da Ali G Show, for which he won a 2001 BAFTA TV Award for Best Comedy Performance. 
In addition to playing Ali G on the series, Baron Cohen played two other characters. One was misogynistic, Jew-hating Khazakstani TV reporter Borat, who was based on a doctor he met in Russia who he found unintentionally funny. The other was Bruno, a gay Austrian fashion expert. 
Baron Cohen made his movie debut in The Jolly Boys Last Stand (2000), also featuring Andy Serkis, who would go on to fame in the Lord of the Rings films.  
He reprised the Ali G character in the feature film Ali G Indahouse (2002), then took it to the States, where he recreated Da Ali G Show from 2003 to 2004 for HBO. 
His film work includes providing the voice of Julien in the animated feature Madagascar (2005) and the role of French race car driver Jean Girrard in Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006) opposite Will Ferrell. 
Reprising his Borat character, he co-wrote and starred in Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006), for which he won a Golden Globe Award.
In 2012, the actor developed another character, General Aladeen, the dictator of the fictional nation of Wadiya, for the film The Dictator (2012). Baron Cohen stirred up controversy when he showed up in character at the 2012 Oscars and dropped the supposed ashes of North Korea leader Kim Jong II all over TV personality Ryan Seacrest.
Aside from The Dictator, Baron Cohen will also be playing Monsieur Thénardier in the big-screen adaptation of Les Misérables (2012) and the voice of King Julien XIII in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (2012).
Baron Cohen, who has a child with his girlfriend, Australian actress Isla Fisher, is reportedly soft-spoken in real life, unlike his outrageous characters.
