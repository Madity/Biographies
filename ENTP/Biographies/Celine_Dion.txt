Céline Marie Claudette Dion, CC OQ ChLD (French pronunciation: [selin djɔ̃] ( listen); born 30 March 1968) is a Canadian singer. Born into a large family from Charlemagne, Quebec,[4] Dion emerged as a teen star in the French-speaking world after her manager and future husband René Angélil mortgaged his home to finance her first record.[5] In 1990, she released the English-language album Unison, establishing herself as a viable pop artist in North America and other English-speaking areas of the world.[6]
Dion first gained international recognition in the 1980s by winning both the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival and the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest where she represented Switzerland.[7][8] Following a series of French albums in the early 1980s, she signed on to CBS Records Canada in 1986. During the 1990s, with the help of Angélil, she achieved worldwide fame after signing with Epic Records and releasing several English albums along with additional French albums, becoming one of the most successful artists in pop music history.[9][10] However, in 1999 at the height of her success, Dion announced a hiatus from entertainment in order to start a family and spend time with her husband, who had been diagnosed with cancer.[10][11] She returned to the top of pop music in 2002 and signed a three-year (later extended to almost five years) contract to perform nightly in a five-star theatrical show at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, Paradise, Nevada.[12][13][14]
Dion's music has been influenced by genres ranging from rock and R&B to gospel and classical. Her recordings are mainly in French and English, although she also sings in Spanish, Italian, German, Latin, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese. While her releases have often received mixed critical reception, she is renowned for her technically skilled and powerful vocals.[15][16][17] Dion has won five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year for Falling Into You and Record of the Year for "My Heart Will Go On (Love Theme from Titanic)".[18] She is the second best-selling female artist in the US during the Nielsen SoundScan era, with her albums Falling Into You and Let's Talk About Love both certified Diamond in the US,[19][20] and is the only female artist to have two singles sell more than a million copies in the UK.[21] In addition, her 1995 album D'eux, is the best-selling French-language album of all time.[22] In 2004, after surpassing 175 million in album sales worldwide, she was presented with the Chopard Diamond Award at the World Music Awards for becoming the best-selling female artist of all time.[23][24] Dion remains the best-selling Canadian artist of all time with record sales of more than 200 million copies worldwide.[25][26][27]
Dion was born in Charlemagne, Quebec, Canada, the youngest of 14 children of Thérèse (née Tanguay), a homemaker, and Adhémar Dion, a butcher, both of French-Canadian descent.[28][29] Dion was raised a Roman Catholic in a poverty-stricken, but, by her own account, happy home in Charlemagne.[10][30] Music had always been a part of the family (Dion was named after the song Céline, recorded by French singer Hugues Aufray two years before her birth [31]). On 13 August 1973, (at the age of five) the young Céline made her first public appearance at her brother Michel's wedding, where she performed Christine Charbonneau's song [32] Du fil des aiguilles et du coton.[33] Thereafter, she continued to perform with her siblings in her parents' small piano bar called Le Vieux Baril. From an early age Dion had dreamed of being a performer.[15] In a 1994 interview with People magazine, she recalled, "I missed my family and my home, but I don't regret having lost my adolescence. I had one dream: I wanted to be a singer."[34]
At age 12, Dion collaborated with her mother and her brother Jacques to compose her first song, "Ce n'était qu'un rêve" ("It Was Only a Dream").[30] Her brother Michel Dondalinger Dion sent the recording to music manager René Angélil, whose name he discovered on the back of a Ginette Reno album.[5] Angélil was moved to tears by Dion's voice, and decided to make her a star.[30] In 1981, he mortgaged his home to fund her first record, La voix du bon Dieu ("The Voice of the Good God"), which later became a local number-one hit and made Dion an instant star in Quebec. Her popularity spread to other parts of the world when she competed in the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo, Japan, and won the musician's award for "Top Performer" as well as the gold medal for "Best Song" with "Tellement j'ai d'amour pour toi" ("I Have So Much Love for You").[5]
By 1983, in addition to becoming the first Canadian artist to receive a gold record in France for the single "D'amour ou d'amitié" ("Of Love or of Friendship"), Dion had also won several Félix Awards, including "Best Female performer" and "Discovery of the Year".[5][35] Further success in Europe, Asia, and Australia came when Dion represented Switzerland in the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest with the song Ne partez pas sans moi (Don't Leave Without Me) and won the contest by a close margin in Dublin, Ireland.[36] However, American success was yet to come as she was at that point exclusively a Francophone artist.[37] At eighteen, after seeing a Michael Jackson performance, Dion told Angélil that she wanted to be a star like Jackson.[38] Though confident in her talent, Angélil realized that her image needed to be changed in order for her to be marketed worldwide.[30] Dion receded from the spotlight for a number of months, during which she underwent dental surgery to improve her appearance, and was sent to the École Berlitz in 1989 to polish her English.[6]
In 1989, during a concert on the Incognito Tour, Dion injured her voice. She consulted the otorhinolaryngologist William Gould,[39][40] who gave her an ultimatum: have immediate surgery on her vocal cords, or do not utilize them at all for three weeks.[39] Dion chose the latter and underwent vocal training with William Riley.[39][39][40][40]
"Where Does My Heart Beat Now", Dion's first North American hit, was 1980s soft rock. (Note the prominence of the electric guitar). It contrasts with the style of subsequent efforts.
Two years after she learned English, Dion made her debut into the Anglophone market with Unison (1990), the lead single having originally been recorded by Laura Branigan.[5] She incorporated the help of many established musicians, including Vito Luprano and Canadian producer David Foster.[15] The album was largely influenced by 1980s soft rock music that quickly found a niche within the adult contemporary radio format. Unison also hit the right notes with critics: Jim Faber of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Dion's vocals were "tastefully unadorned", and that she never attempted to "bring off styles that are beyond her".[41] Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic declared it as, "a fine, sophisticated American debut."[42] Singles from the album included "(If There Was) Any Other Way", "The Last to Know", "Unison", and "Where Does My Heart Beat Now", a mid-tempo soft-rock ballad which made prominent use of the electric guitar. The latter became her first single to reach the top-ten on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number-four. The album established Dion as a rising singer in the United States, and across Continental Europe and Asia.
In 1991, Dion was a featured soloist in Voices That Care, a tribute to American troops fighting in Operation Desert Storm. Dion's real international breakthrough came when she duetted with Peabo Bryson on the title track to Disney's animated film Beauty and the Beast (1991).[43] The song captured a musical style that Dion would utilize in the future: sweeping, classically influenced ballads with soft instrumentation. Both a critical and commercial hit, the song became her second U.S. top-ten single, and won the Academy Award for Best Song, and the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.[15] "Beauty and the Beast" was featured on Dion's 1992 self-titled album, which, like her debut, had a strong pop rock influence combined with elements of soul and classical music. Owing to the success of the lead-off single and her collaborations with David Foster and Diane Warren, the album was even more well-received commercially than Unison. Other singles that achieved moderate success included "If You Asked Me To" (a cover of Patti LaBelle's song from the 1989 movie Licence to Kill) which peaked at number-four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, the gospel-tinged "Love Can Move Mountains", and "Nothing Broken But My Heart".
Also during this time, Dion released the Francophone album Dion chante Plamondon. The album consisted mostly of covers, but featured 4 new songs: "Des mots qui sonnent", "Je danse dans ma tête", "Quelqu'un que j'aime, quelqu'un qui m'aime" and "L'amour existe encore". It was originally released in Canada and France during the 1991–1992 period, then later received an international release in 1994, the first French Celine Dion album to do so. "Un garçon pas comme les autres (Ziggy)" became a smash hit in France, reaching number-two and being certified gold. In Quebec, the album was certified Gold the day it was released.
By 1992, Unison, Céline Dion, and numerous high-profile media appearances had propelled Dion to superstardom in North America. She had achieved one of her main objectives: wedging her way into the Anglophone market and achieving fame.[37] However, while she was experiencing rising success in the U.S., her French fans in Canada criticized her for neglecting them.[15][44] She would later rebuff these criticisms at the 1991 Félix Awards show, where, after winning "English Artist of the Year", she openly refused to accept the award. She asserted that she was—and would always be—a French, not an English, artist.[6][45] Apart from her commercial success, there were also changes in Dion's personal life, as Angélil, who was twenty-six years her senior, transitioned from manager to lover. However, the relationship was kept a secret as they both feared that the public would find their relations inappropriate.[46]
In 1993, Dion announced her feelings for her manager by declaring him "the colour of [her] love" in the dedication section of her third English-language album The Colour of My Love. However, instead of criticizing their relationship as Dion had feared, fans embraced the couple.[15] Eventually, Angélil and Dion married in an extravagant wedding ceremony in December 1994, which was broadcast live on Canadian television.
As with most of her catalog, The Colour of my Love had overriding themes of love and romance.[47] It became her most successful record up to that point, selling more than six million copies in the U.S., two million in Canada, and peaking at number-one in many countries. The album also spawned Dion's first U.S., Canadian, and Australian number-one single "The Power of Love" (a remake of Jennifer Rush's 1985 hit), which would become her signature hit until she reached new career heights in the late 1990s.[37] The single "When I Fall in Love", a duet with Clive Griffin, achieved moderate success on the U.S. and Canadian charts, and was nominated for two Grammy Awards, winning one. The Colour of My Love also became Dion's first major hit in Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom. Both the album and the single "Think Twice" simultaneously occupied the top of the British charts for five consecutive weeks. "Think Twice", which remained at number-one for seven weeks, eventually became the fourth single by a female artist to sell in excess of one million copies in the UK,[48] while the album was eventually certified five-times platinum for two-million copies sold.[49]
Dion kept to her French roots and continued to release many Francophone recordings between each English record.[50] Generally, they achieved more credibility than her English-language works.[44] She released À l'Olympia, a live album that was recorded during one of Dion's concerts at the Paris Olympia in 1994. It had one promotional single, a live version of "Calling You", which peaked at seventy-five on the French Singles Chart. She also recorded a bilingual version of Petit Papa Noël with Alvin and the Chipmunks for the 1994 holiday album A Very Merry Chipmunk. D'eux (also known as The French Album in the United States), was released in 1995, and it would go on to become the best-selling French-language album of all time.[50] The album was mostly written and produced by Jean-Jacques Goldman, and amassed huge success with the singles "Pour que tu m'aimes encore" and "Je sais pas". "Pour que tu m'aimes encore" reached number 1 in France and stayed at the top position for twelve weeks. It was later certified Platinum in France.[51] The single also reached the top ten in the UK and Ireland, a rare accomplishment for a French song. The second single off the album, "Je sais pas", reached number-one on the French Singles Chart as well and was certified Silver there.[52] These songs would later become "If That's What It Takes" and "I Don't Know" on Dion's next English album, Falling into You.
During the mid-1990s and onward, Dion's albums were generally constructed on the basis of melodramatic Adult contemporary ballads, with sprinklings of up-tempo pop and rare forays into other genres.[53] She collaborated with many renowned writers and producers such as Jim Steinman and David Foster, who helped her to develop a signature sound.[15][54] While critical reviews fluctuated, Dion's releases performed increasingly well on the international charts, and in 1996 she won the World Music Award for "World's Best-selling Female Recording Artist of the Year" for the third time. By the mid-1990s, she had established herself as one of the best-selling artists in the world.[55]
One of the final tracks on the album, "Call the Man", features a choir chanting and humming in an African language.
This song's theme is centred on childhood memories (esp. from Céline's childhood in Charlemagne, Canada) and how people's "inner child" remains.
Falling into You (1996), Dion's fourth English-language album, presented the singer at the height of her popularity, and showed a further progression of her music.[46] In an attempt to reach a wider audience, the album combined many elements, such as complex orchestral sounds, African chanting and elaborate musical effects. Additionally, instruments like the violin, Spanish guitar, trombone, the cavaquinho and saxophone created a new sound.[56] The singles encompassed a variety of musical styles. The title track "Falling into You" and "River Deep – Mountain High" (a Tina Turner cover) made prominent use of percussion instruments; "It's All Coming Back to Me Now" (produced by its writer Jim Steinman) and a remake of Eric Carmen's "All by Myself" maintained a soft-rock atmosphere, combined with the classical sound of the piano; and the number-one single "Because You Loved Me", which was written by Diane Warren, was a pop ballad that served as the theme to the 1996 film Up Close & Personal.[55]
Falling into You garnered career-best reviews for Dion. While Dan Leroy wrote that it was not very different from her previous work,[57] and Stephen Holden of The New York Times and Natalie Nichols of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the album was formulaic,[58][59] other critics, such as Chuck Eddy of Entertainment Weekly, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AMG and Daniel Durchholz, lavished the album as "compelling", "passionate", "stylish", "elegant" and "remarkably well-crafted".[56][60] Falling Into You became Dion's most critically and commercially successful album: it topped the charts in many countries and became one of the best-selling albums of all time.[61] In 2013, CBC Music ranked Falling into you 33rd in their list of the 100 greatest Canadian albums ever.[62] In the United States, the album reached number-one,[63] and was later certified 11x Platinum for over 11 million copies shipped.[64] In Canada, the album was certified diamond for over one million copies shipped.[65] The IFPI certified Falling into You 9x Platinum, an accolade that has been given to only two other albums in history, with one of the two being Dion's own album, Let's Talk About Love.[66] The album also won Grammy Awards for Best Pop Album, and the academy's highest honor Album of the Year.[67] Dion's status on the world stage was further solidified when she was asked to perform "The Power of the Dream" at the opening ceremonies of the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games.[68] In March 1996, Dion launched the Falling into You Tour in support of her new album, giving concerts around the world for over a year.

Dion followed Falling into You with Let's Talk About Love (1997), which was publicized as its sequel.[69] The recording process took place in London, New York City, and Los Angeles, and featured a host of special guests, such as Barbra Streisand on "Tell Him"; the Bee Gees on "Immortality"; and world-renowned tenor Luciano Pavarotti on "I Hate You Then I Love You".[46][70] Other musicians included Carole King, Sir George Martin, Bryan Adams and Jamaican singer Diana King, who added a reggae tinge to "Treat Her Like a Lady".[71] As with Falling into You, Let's Talk About Love was a major success for Dion, reaching number-one all over the world, attaining platinum status in twenty-four sales territories, and becoming the fastest selling album of her career.[72] In the United States, the album topped the chart in its seventh week of release,[73] and was later certified 10x Platinum in the U.S. for over 10 million copies shipped.[74] In Canada, the album sold 230,212 copies in its first week of release, which became, and still is, a record.[75] It was eventually certified diamond in Canada for over 1 million copies shipped.[76][77] The most successful single from the album was the classically influenced ballad "My Heart Will Go On", which was written and composed by James Horner and Will Jennings, and produced by Horner and Walter Afanasieff.[67] Serving as the love theme for the 1997 blockbuster film Titanic, the song topped the charts across the world, and became Dion's signature song;[78] as well as winning the Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Original Song.[79] The song also garnered Dion two Grammy Awards for "Best Female Pop Vocal Performance" and the most coveted "Record of the Year", (the song itself won four awards, but two were presented to the songwriters).[80] "My Heart Will Go On" and "Think Twice" made her the only female artist in the UK to have two singles to sell more than a million copies.[81] In support of her album, Dion embarked on the Let's Talk About Love Tour between 1998 and 1999.[82]
Dion ended the 1990s with three more extremely successful albums: the Christmas album These Are Special Times (1998), the French-language album, S'il suffisait d'aimer, and the compilation album All the Way... A Decade of Song (1999).[83] On These Are Special Times, Dion co-wrote the song "Don't Save It All For Christmas Day" along with Ric Wake and Peter Zizzo.[84] The album was her most classically influenced yet, with orchestral arrangements found on virtually every track.[85] The album featured the single "I'm Your Angel", a duet with R. Kelly, which became Dion's fourth U.S. number one single, and a smash hit across the world. All the Way... A Decade of Song drew together her most successful hits coupled with seven new songs, including the lead off single "That's the Way It Is", a cover of Roberta Flack's "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face", and "All the Way", a duet with Frank Sinatra.[83] All the way became one of the best-selling compilation albums of all time, reaching number-one in the United States for three weeks.[63] The album was later certified 7x Platinum in the U.S. for 7 million copies shipped.[86] It also topped the charts in the UK,[87] Canada,[88] and Australia.[89] Her last French-language studio album of the 1990s, S'il suffisait d'aimer, was very successful as well, topping the charts in every major French-speaking country, including France,[90] Switzerland,[91] Belgium Wallonia,[92] and Canada.[88] In France, the album was certified diamond, selling 1.5 million copies.[93] By the end of the 1990s, Celine Dion had sold more than 100 million albums worldwide, and had won a slew of industry awards.[94] Her status as one of the music industry's biggest pop divas was further solidified when she was asked to perform on VH1's Divas Live special in 1998, with superstars Aretha Franklin, Gloria Estefan, Shania Twain and Mariah Carey.[95] That year she also received two of the highest honours from her home country: "Officer of the Order of Canada for Outstanding Contribution to the World of Contemporary Music"[96][97] and "Officer of the National Order of Quebec".[98] A year later she was inducted into the Canadian Broadcast Hall of Fame, and was honoured with a star on Canada's Walk of Fame.[99]
Starting from the mid-nineties, the pop rock influence that was more noticeable in her earlier releases, was replaced by a more Adult contemporary feel.[69] Additionally, the recurring theme of "love" dominated most of her releases, which led to some critics dismissing her music as banal.[100] Other critics, like Elysa Gardner and Jose F. Promis, praised her voice during this period, describing it as a "technical marvel".[101][102] Steve Dollar, in his review of These Are Special Times, opined that Dion was a "vocal Olympian for whom there ain't no mountain—or scale—high enough."[103]
After releasing and promoting thirteen albums during the 1990s, Dion stated that she needed to settle down, and announced on her latest album All the Way... A Decade of Song, that she needed to take a step back from the spotlight and enjoy life.[10][104] Angélil's diagnosis with throat cancer also prompted her to hiatus.[105] While on break, Dion was unable to escape the spotlight. In 2000, the National Enquirer published a false story about the singer. Brandishing a picture of Dion and her husband, the magazine misquoted Dion, printing the headline, "Celine — 'I'm Pregnant With Twins!'"[106] Dion later sued the magazine for more than twenty million dollars.[107] The editors of the Enquirer printed an apology and a full retraction to Dion in the next issue, and donated money to the American Cancer Society in honor of Dion and her husband. A year after the incident, after undergoing fertility treatments, Dion gave birth to a son, René-Charles Dion Angélil, on 25 January 2001, in Florida.[108][109] Following the September 11 attacks, Dion returned to the music scene, and in a televised performance sang "God Bless America" at the benefit concert America: A Tribute to Heroes. Chuck Taylor of Billboard wrote, "the performance... brings to mind what has made her one of the celebrated vocalists of our time: the ability to render emotion that shakes the soul. Affecting, meaningful, and filled with grace, this is a musical reflection to share with all of us still searching for ways to cope."[110] Dion would perform it again in 2003 during pregame festivities for Super Bowl XXXVII in San Diego.[111]
In December 2001, Dion published her autobiography, My Story, My Dream which chronicled her rags to riches story.[112]
Dion ended her three-year sabbatical from the music industry with the aptly titled album A New Day Has Come, released in March 2002. The album was Dion's most personal yet, with songs focusing on her motherhood and maturation as a woman such as "A New Day Has Come", and "Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)". She stated: "becoming a mother makes you a grown-up."[104] She stated, "A New Day Has Come, for Rene, for me, is the baby. It has everything to do with the baby...That song "A New Day Has Come" represents very well the mood I'm feeling right now. It represents the whole album."[113] A New Day Has Come debuted at number one in over 17 countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada.[114][115][116] In the United States, the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with first week sales of 527,000 copies; marking her first number one debut on the chart, as well as the highest debut sales week of her career in the US.[117] It was eventually certified 3x Platinum in the United States,[118] and 6x Platinum in Canada.[119]
While the album was commercially successful, critical reviews suggested that it was "forgettable" and the lyrics were "lifeless".[120] Both Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone magazine, and Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly, stated that Dion's music had not developed much during her break, and classed her material as trite and mediocre.[121][122] Sal Cinquemani of Slant magazine called the album "a lengthy collection of drippy, gooey pop fluffer-nutter."[123] The first single off the album, A New Day Has Come peaked at No.22 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, being an airplay-only release. On the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, however the song spent 21 consecutive weeks at number 1, breaking the record for the longest span at the top.[124] The previous record holders were Phil Collins' You'll Be in My Heart and Dion's own Because You Loved Me, both of which lasted nineteen weeks at number 1. During 2002, she performed for many benefit concerts, including her second appearance on VH1 Divas Live, a concert to benefit the VH1 Save The Music Foundation, alongside Cher, Anastacia, Dixie Chicks, Mary J. Blige, Whitney Houston, Cyndi Lauper, Shakira and Stevie Nicks.
In conjunction with an endorsement deal with Chrysler, Dion released One Heart (2003), an album that represented her appreciation for life.[125] The album largely consisted of pop and dance music—a deviation from the soaring, melodramatic ballads, for which she had been known. Although the album achieved moderate success, One Heart was met with mixed criticism, and words such as "predictable" and "banal" appeared even in the most lenient reviews.[126][127] A cover of the 1989 Cyndi Lauper hit "I Drove All Night", released to launch her advertising campaign with Chrysler,[128] incorporated elements of dance-pop and rock and roll. The advertising deal was met with criticism, with some stating that Dion was trying to cater to her sponsors.[129] However, people like Bonita Stewart, who was the director of Chrysler Group Marketing Communications stated that "Chrysler was taken by how her appeal crossed ethnic lines." She also added, "She brings sophistication, refinement, romance and passion to the brand."[130]
After One Heart, Dion released her next English Language studio album, Miracle (2004). Miracle was a multimedia project conceived by Dion and Australian photographer Anne Geddes, and had a theme centering on babies and motherhood. The album was filled with lullabies and other songs of maternal love and inspiration, including covers of Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World" and John Lennon's "Beautiful Boy". The reviews for Miracle were mixed.[131] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic.com gave the album three of out five stars, stating, "The worst you can say about the record is that there are no surprises, but the audience for this record doesn't want surprises; they want comfort, whether it arrives in polished music or artsy photos of newborns, and Miracle provides both, which makes it appealing for those expectant or new mothers in Dion's audience.[131] Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine wrote that the single "Beautiful Boy" was "an unexpected gem" and called Dion "a timeless, enormously versatile artist",[132] Chuck Arnold of People Magazine, however, labeled the album as excessively sentimental,[133] while Nancy Miller of Entertainment Weekly opined that "the whole earth-mama act is just opportunism, reborn".[134] Miracle debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 chart and number one in Canada, and was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA.[135]
The Francophone album 1 fille & 4 types (1 Girl & 4 Guys), released in October 2003, fared better than her previous two releases, and showed Dion trying to distance herself from the "diva" image. She recruited Jean-Jacques Goldman, Gildas Arzel, Eric Benzi, and Jacques Veneruso, with whom she had previously worked on two of her best-selling French albums S'il suffisait d'aimer and D'eux. Labeled "the album of pleasure" by Dion herself, the album cover showed Dion in a simple and relaxed manner, contrary to the choreographed poses usually found on her album covers. The album achieved widespread commercial success in France, Canada, and Belgium where it reached number one. In France, the album debuted at number one and was later certified 2x platinum after selling over 700,000 copies. Critic, Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic wrote that Dion's vocals "are back at top of their game" and that she was "getting back to pop basics and performing at a level unheard in a while."[136]
Though her albums were commercially successful, they did not achieve the sales or the reception of her previous works. Her songs received less airplay as radio became less embracing of balladeers like Dion, Carey, and Houston, and was focused on more up-tempo, Urban/Hip-hop songs.[137] Regardless, by 2004, Dion had accumulated sales of more than 175 million albums worldwide, and received the Chopard Diamond Award from the World Music Awards for her achievements.[138] According to the official World Music Awards website, the award is rare; it is "not presented every year" and an artist can only be presented with the award for selling "over 100 million albums during their career."[139]
In early 2002, Dion had announced a three-year, 600-show contract to appear five nights a week in an entertainment extravaganza, A New Day..., at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas.[12] This move was generally seen as risky, but journalist Miriam Nunzio wrote that it was "one of the smartest business decisions in years by any major recording artist".[140] Dion conceived the idea for the show after seeing O by Franco Dragone during her break from recording, and it premiered on 25 March 2003, in a 4,000-seat arena specifically designed for her show and modeled after the Roman Colosseum.[12] Many stars attended the opening night including Dick Clark, Alan Thicke, Kathy Griffin, Lance Bass and Justin Timberlake, who hosted the television special.[141] The show, directed by Dragone and choreographed by the renowned Mia Michaels, was a combination of dance, music, and visual effects. It included Dion performing her biggest hits against an array of dancers and special effects. Reviewer Mike Weatherford felt that, at first, Dion was not as relaxed as she should be, and at times, it was hard to find the singer among the excessive stage ornamentation and dancers. However, he noted that the show had become more enjoyable over the course of its run, due to Dion's improved stage-presence and simplified costumes.[78]
The show was well-received by audiences, despite the complaints of expensive tickets; it routinely sold out until its end in late 2007.[142] Ticket prices averaged $135.33.[143] According to Pollstar, Dion sold 322,000 tickets and grossed US$43.9 million in the first half of 2005, and by July 2005, she had sold out 315 out of 384 shows.[144] By the end of 2005, Dion grossed more than US$76 million, placing sixth on Billboard's Money Makers list for 2005.[145] A New Day... was the 6th biggest selling tour in America in 2006.[146] Because of the show's success, Dion's contract was extended into 2007 for an undisclosed sum. On 5 January 2007 it was announced that the show would end on 15 December 2007, with tickets for the period after October 2007 having gone on sale from 1 March.[147] During its entire run, the show accumulated a total gross of $400 million, while being seen by nearly 3 million fans.[148][149] The Live in Las Vegas - A New Day... DVD was released on 10 December 2007 in Europe and the following day in North America.[150]
On 21 May 2007, Dion released the French-language album D'elles (About Them), which debuted at the top of the Canadian album charts, selling 72,200 copies in its first week. It marked her tenth number-one album in the SoundScan era, and her eighth to debut at the top position. In Canada, the album has been certified 2× platinum, and within the first month had already shipped half a million units worldwide.[151] D'Elles also reached No. 1 in France and Belgium. The first single "Et s'il n'en restait qu'une (je serais celle-là)" (meaning "And If There Was Only One Woman Left (I Would Be That One)") debuted at the top of the French singles chart a month earlier. Later that same year, Dion released the English album Taking Chances on 12 November in Europe, and 13 November in North America.[152] Her first English studio album since 2003's One Heart, it featured pop, R&B, and rock inspired music.[153] For this album, Dion collaborated with John Shanks and ex-Evanescence guitarist Ben Moody, as well as Kristian Lundin, Peer Astrom, Linda Perry, Japanese singer Yuna Ito, and R&B singer-songwriter Ne-Yo.[154][155] Dion stated, "I think this album represents a positive evolution in my career ... I'm feeling strong, maybe a little gutsier than in the past, and just as passionate about music and life as I ever was."[156] Dion launched her year-long worldwide Taking Chances Tour on 14 February 2008 in South Africa, performing 132 dates in stadiums and arenas across five continents.[157]
The Taking Chances Tour was a great success in the United States, reaching the Number 1 spot on the Billboard Boxscore, having sold out every concert in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, she appeared on Idol Gives Back for a second year in a row. Dion was nominated for six Juno Awards in 2008, adding to her 53 previous nominations (an all-time record). Her nominations included Artist of the Year, Pop Album of the Year (for Taking Chances), Francophone Album of the Year (for D'elles) and Album of the Year (for both Taking Chances and D'elles).[158] The following year, Dion was nominated for 3 Juno Awards including the Fan Choice Award, Song of the Year (for Taking Chances), and Music DVD of the Year (for Live in Las Vegas — A New Day...)[159]
On 22 August 2008, Dion presented a free outdoor concert, mostly in French[160] on the Plains of Abraham, in Quebec City, Canada, for the 400th anniversary of Quebec City.[161] The celebration gathered approximately 490,000 people. The concert, called Céline sur les Plaines, was released on DVD on 11 November 2008 in Quebec and was released on 20 May 2009 in France.[162] The end of October 2008 saw the worldwide release of a comprehensive English-language greatest hits album called My Love: Essential Collection.[163]
In May 2009, Celine Dion was named the 20th best-selling artist of the decade and the second-best-selling female artist of the decade in the United States, selling an estimated 17.57 million albums there since 2000.[164] In June 2009, Forbes reported that Dion earned $100 million during 2008. In December 2009, Pollstar announced that Dion was the best-selling solo touring act of the decade and the second-best-selling touring act of the decade, behind only the Dave Matthews Band.[165] Dion grossed $522.2 million during the decade, a large portion of that sum coming from her five-year residency at Caesars Palace.[165]
On 17 February 2010 Dion released into theaters a documentary film about her Taking Chances Tour, titled, Celine: Through the Eyes of the World.[166] The documentary shows behind-the-scenes footage of Dion both onstage and offstage, along with footage of Dion with her family as they traveled the world with her.[166] The distributor is the Sony Pictures subsidiary, Hot Ticket.[166] The film was later released on Blu-ray and DVD on 4 May 2010, along with the CD/DVD, Taking Chances World Tour: The Concert.[167][168] At the 52nd Grammy Awards in February 2010, Dion joined Carrie Underwood, Usher, Jennifer Hudson and Smokey Robinson to perform the song "Earth Song" during the 3-D Michael Jackson tribute.[169]

In January 2010, The Los Angeles Times presented its annual list of the top ten largest earners of the year, revealing that Dion took the top spot for the entire decade, with $US747.9 million in total revenue from 2000–2009.[170] The largest haul came from ticket sales, totaling $522.2 million.[170] Additionally, Dion was named "Artist of the Decade" in her native Canadian province of Quebec, announced by the Montreal-based newspaper, Le Journal de Quebec in 2009 December.[171] A public online survey asked responders to vote for who they believe deserved the above-mentioned accolade.[171]
Furthermore, in a May 2010 Harris Poll, Dion was named the most popular musician in the United States, ahead of U2, Elvis Presley, and The Beatles, while factoring in gender, political affiliations, geographic region of residence, and income.[172] Specifically, Dion was the most popular musician in the female demographic, as well as among all Democrats, those who live in the eastern United States and southern United States, and those who have incomes between US$35k and US$74.9k.[173][174]
In September 2010, she released the single "Voler", a duet with French singer Michel Sardou. The song was later included on Sardou's album.[175] In addition, it was announced in October 2010 that Dion wrote and composed a new song for Canadian singer, Marc Dupré entitled "Entre deux mondes".[176]
In an interview with People magazine published in February 2010, Dion announced that she would be returning to Caesars Palace in Las Vegas for Celine, a three-year residency for seventy shows a year, beginning 15 March 2011.[177] She stated that the show will feature, "all the songs from my repertoire that people want to hear" and will contain a selection of music from classic Hollywood films.[177] To promote her return to Las Vegas, Dion made an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show on 21 February, during the show's final season, marking her record twenty-seventh appearance.[178][179] Additionally, for a record sixth time, Dion performed at the 83rd Academy Awards, where she sang the song "Smile," as part of the ceremony's "In Memoriam" segment.[180] On 4 September, Dion appeared on the 2011 MDA Labor Telethon Event and presented a prerecorded performance of "Open Arms" from her new Las Vegas show.[181] On 1 October 2011, the OWN Network premiered a documentary on Dion's life, detailing the months before, during and after her pregnancy, to the makings of her new Las Vegas Show, called, "Celine: 3 Boys and a New Show".[182] The documentary became the second highest rated show on TV OWN Canada. In October, FlightNetwork.com conducted a poll asking 780 participants which celebrity they would most like to sit next to on an airplane. Dion was the top favorite, with 23.7% of the vote.[183] Also, in September, Dion released the 14th perfume from her Celine Dion Parfums Collection, called "Signature".[184] On 15 September, Dion made an appearance at the free concert of world-famous tenor, Andrea Bocelli, in Central Park in New York.[185] In 2012 she performed at the 16th Jazz and Blues Festival in Jamaica.[186]
In October 2012, Sony Music Entertainment released The Best of Celine Dion & David Foster in Asia.[187] Dion began recording songs for her next English and French albums during April and May 2012.[188] The French-language album, Sans attendre was released on 2 November 2012 and was a smash success in all French-speaking territories, especially in France where it achieved diamond status.[189] The English-language album was postponed to 1 November 2013.[190] Titled Loved Me Back to Life, it included collaborations with an exceptional team of songwriters and producers, including duets with Ne-Yo and Stevie Wonder.[191] The lead single, "Loved Me Back to Life" was released on 3 September 2013.[192] Dion embarked on the Sans attendre Tour in November 2013 and performed in Belgium and France.[193] "Breakaway," "Incredible" and "Water and a Flame" were chosen as next singles.[194][195]
On 16 May 2014, Dion released a three-disc set (2CD/DVD and 2CD/Blu-ray) titled Céline une seule fois / Live 2013, which reached top ten on the album charts in France, Canada and Belgium Wallonia.[196][better source needed]
Dion was able to collaborate with Barbra Streisand (left) and the Bee Gees (right), both cited as great influences in her recording career.
Dion cites idols as varied as Aretha Franklin, Charles Aznavour, Michael Jackson, Carole King, Anne Murray, Barbra Streisand, and the Bee Gees, all of whom she would eventually collaborate with.[197][198] Dion has also stated that she grew up listening to artists such as Janis Joplin, the Doobie Brothers, and Creedence Clearwater Revival, but never got the chance to sing their genre of music. She has also shown appreciation for Edith Piaf, Sir Elton John, Cher, Tina Turner and many 1960s, 1970s and 1980s soul singers such as Etta James, Roberta Flack and Patti Labelle. Among her peers, she has expressed admiration for fellow vocalist Whitney Houston, whom she had often been compared to.[199] Her music has been influenced by numerous genres, including pop, rock, gospel, R&B and soul, and her lyrics focus on themes of poverty, world hunger, and spirituality, with an emphasis on love and romance.[47][200] After the birth of her first child, her work increasingly focused on maternal love.[131][201][202][203]
Dion has faced considerable criticism from critics, who state that her music often retreats behind pop and soul conventions, and is marked by excessive sentimentality.[6][100] According to Keith Harris of Rolling Stone magazine, "[Dion's] sentimentality is bombastic and defiant rather than demure and retiring....[she] stands at the end of the chain of drastic devolution that goes Aretha-Whitney-Mariah. Far from being an aberration, Dion actually stands as a symbol of a certain kind of pop sensibility—bigger is better, too much is never enough, and the riper the emotion the more true."[204] Dion's francophone releases, by contrast, tend to be deeper and more varied than her English releases, and consequently have achieved more credibility.[44][205]
Critics have stated that Dion's involvement in the production aspect of her music is fundamentally lacking, which results in her work being overproduced[205] and impersonal.[44] However, coming from a family in which all of her siblings were musicians, she dabbled in learning how to play instruments like piano and guitar, and practiced with a Fender Stratocaster during the recording sessions of her album, Falling into You. [206] Although rare, Dion has contributed to the writing of a handful of her English and French songs, as well as writing a few songs for other artists such as Marc Dupre. Additionally, as her career progressed, she found herself taking charge in the production of her albums. On her first English album, which she recorded before she had a firm command of the English language, she expressed disapproval, which could have been avoided if she had assumed more creative input.[44] By the time she released her second English album Celine Dion, she had assumed more control of the production and recording process, hoping to dispel earlier criticisms. She stated, "On the second album I said, 'Well, I have the choice to be afraid one more time and not be 100% happy, or not be afraid and be part of this album.' This is my album."[44] Besides her contributions to some of her early French albums, Dion wrote a few of the songs on Let's Talk About Love (1997) and These Are Special Times (1998).[2]
Dion is often the subject of media ridicule[207] and parody, and is frequently impersonated on shows like MADtv, Saturday Night Live, South Park, Royal Canadian Air Farce and This Hour Has 22 Minutes for her strong accent and on-stage gesticulations. However, Dion has stated that she is unaffected by the comments, and is flattered that people take the time to impersonate her.[104] She even invited Ana Gasteyer, who parodied her on SNL, to appear on stage during one of her performances in New York. While she is rarely politically outspoken, in 2005 following the Hurricane Katrina disaster, Dion appeared on Larry King Live and tearfully criticized the U.S. government's slow response in aiding the victims of the hurricane: "There's people still there waiting to be rescued. To me that is not acceptable...How can it be so easy to send planes in another country to kill everybody in a second and destroy lives. We need to serve our country."[208] After her interview, she stated, "When I do interviews with Larry King or the big TV shows like that, they put you on the spot, which is very difficult. I do have an opinion, but I'm a singer. I'm not a politician."[209]
Dion is often regarded as one of pop music's most influential voices.[6][44][210] According to Linda Lister in Divafication: The Deification of Modern Female Pop Stars, she has been described as a reigning "Queen of Pop" for her influence over the record industry during the 1990s, alongside other female entertainers, including Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey.[211] In a countdown of the "22 Greatest Voices in Music" by Blender Magazine and MTV, she placed ninth (sixth for a female), and she was also placed fourth in Cove magazine's list of "The 100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists."[17][212][213] Dion is often compared to Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston for her vocal style and to her idol, Barbra Streisand, for her voice.[214]
According to various sources, Dion possesses a five-octave vocal range,[215][216][217] although arguably fully spanding three-octave only as showcased by her so far.[218] Dion once stated that she is a mezzo-soprano.[219] However, attempts to adapt classical voice types to other forms of singing have been met with controversy.[220] Without making a classification, maestro Kent Nagano remarked, "All you just sang was soprano," after Dion auditioned with two solos from Carmen, wanting to know if she could sing opera.[219] Her timbre has been described as "thin, slightly nasal"[221] with a "raspy" lower register and "bell glass-like high notes."[222]
Dion is often praised for her technical virtuosity.[223] Jim Santella of The Buffalo News writes "Like an iron fist in a velvet glove, the power of Celine Dion's voice is cloaked in a silky vibrato that betrays the intensity of her vocal commitment."[224] Jeff Miers, also of The Buffalo News, says of Dion "Her singing voice is absolutely extra-human. She hits notes in full voice, with a controlled vibrato and an incredible conception of pitch, like she's shucking an ear of corn"[225] Stephen Holden of The New York Times states that Dion has "a good-sized arsenal of technical skills. She can deliver tricky melismas, produce expressive vocal catches and sustain long notes without the tiniest wavering of pitch. And as her duets [...] have shown, she is a reliable harmony voice."[221] In an interview with Libération, Jean-Jacques Goldman notes that she has "no problem of accuracy or tempo."[226] According to Kent Nagano, maestro of the Munich Symphony Orchestra, Dion is "a musician who has a good ear, a refinement, and a degree of perfection that is enviable."[219] Charles Alexander of TIME states, "[Her] voice glides effortlessly from deep whispers to dead-on high notes, a sweet siren that combines force with grace."[37]
In her French repertoire, Dion adorns her vocals with more nuances and expressiveness, with the emotional intensity being "more tender and intimate."[227] Additionally, Luc Plamondon, a French singer-songwriter who has worked closely with Dion claims that there are three chanteuses (stylistically) that Dion uses: the Québécois, the French, and the American.[227] Her self-titled album was promoted with the slogan "Remember the name because you'll never forget the voice."
Celine Dion is regarded as one of pop music's most influential voices. Linda Lister describes Dion as a reigning Queen of Pop for her influence over the record industry during the 1990s.[228] Her music and vocal style, alongside that of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, have been said to shape how the bulk of modern female pop vocalists sing. These three singers have been widely credited with reviving the power ballad, and in doing so reshaping the adult contemporary genre, making it one of the most popular genres of the 1990s and early 2000s. According to producer, musician, and former American Idol judge Randy Jackson, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston are the voices of the modern era.[229] Cultural critic Carl Wilson notes that Dion's "fame and influence is also renewed and expressed regularly these days by American Idol, the largest mass musical phenomenon of the past decade, where Celine's stood solidly in its pantheon of singers for young people to emulate".[230] Many contestants on the countless televised talent competitions that have risen at the turn of the millennium often emulate Dion, Houston and Carey and cite them as idols.[231]
Many artists have either mentioned Dion as a major influence or as one of their favorite singers including: Rihanna,[232] Rita Ora,[233] Christina Aguilera,[234] Frank Ocean,[235] Adele,[236] Josh Groban,[237] Delta Goodrem,[238] Jordin Sparks,[239] Charice,[240] Leona Lewis,[241] Jessie J,[242] Jojo,[243] Lea Michele,[244] Jennifer Hudson,[245] Ariana Grande,[246] Regine Velasquez, Taylor Swift,[247] Vanessa Hudgens,[248] The Canadian Tenors, Faith Hill, Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson,[249] Helena Paparizou and Lara Fabian, among many others. In the liner notes of Lara Fabian's album Toutes les femmes en moi, Fabian expressed how she had idolized Dion since her adolescence, even writing: "I would follow note by note your musicality, your passion, sung like only your voice can give colors to the harmony." Country singer Martina McBride is widely heralded by the press as the Celine Dion of Country music.[250]
Numerous artists have also praised Dion's voice, singing ability or expressed an interest in working with her including Placido Domingo,[251] Beyonce,[252] Carlos Santana,[253] Elton John,[254] One Republic,[255] Coldplay,[256] Sharon Osbourne,[257] Nicole Scherzinger,[258] Ne-Yo,[259] Carole King,[260] Barbra Streisand,[261] Luciano Pavarotti,[262] Bee Gees,[263] Sir George Martin,[263] Justin Bieber,[264] Jean-Jacques Goldman[265] and Cher.[266] According to Timbaland "Celine has such a beautiful, mesmerizing voice. She is so talented. I think we could create something that is a classic like she is already." Josh Groban remarked "She's a powerhouse. In this day and age, when more and more studio-produced, tiny-tiny voices are being rewarded... she has this extraordinary instrument.".[237] "Celine is the best singer by far of her generation" according to Diane Warren,[267] an opinion shared by Quincy Jones,[268] Tommy Mottola and David Foster.[269] Moreover, Shania Twain[270] and Jennifer Lopez have praised Celine Dion's dynamic stage presence with Jennifer Lopez commenting on American Idol: "Celine gets on stage, she owns the stage, she runs all over that stage, she stops that stage."[271]
On a cultural level, Dion is credited for introducing francophone music to many non-francophone countries around the globe. Her albums D'eux and S'il suffisait d'aimer remain the best selling francophone albums in history gaining unprecedented success in non-Francophone markets such as the United Kingdom, Poland, Netherlands, Portugal, Greece, Austria, Japan and New Zealand. According to RFI Musique, Celine "has done her bit for French music over the years, assuring the success of French songs which would probably never have got beyond Francophone borders without her... Without Celine French record sales would be dramatically lower!"[272] In 2008 Dion received the Legion of Honour from Nicolas Sarkozy further proving her cultural impact.[273] Sarkozy praised Celine and stated: "France thanks you because your talent and success have contributed to the influence of the French language outside our borders".
Dion is also credited for both revitalizing and revolutionizing the entertainment scene in Las Vegas with the gargantuan successes of her residencies there. She managed to re-popularize the Las Vegas “residency” as a desirable way for top artists to essentially tour in place, letting their fans come to them. Over the years, fellow established icons such as Elton John, Bette Midler, Rod Stewart, Cher and Shania Twain followed suit.[274][275] According to Gary Bongiovanni, president and editor-in-chief of Pollstar “Celine redefined what artists can do in Las Vegas, helping to make it arguably the busiest entertainment city in the world.”[276] By 2013, even the much-younger pop star Britney Spears had announced a Vegas residency, further cementing the extent of Dion's influence on the city as an entertainment capital.[277] Kurt Melien, vice president of entertainment at Caesar's Palace stated “Celine was a pioneer without question..Twenty years ago, we couldn’t have got someone the stature of Britney Spears to appear in Vegas. Stars likes her would never have considered it if Celine hadn’t paved the way. She changed the face of modern Vegas.”[278] Regarding her financial impact on Las Vegas, Stephen Brown, director of the Centre for Business and Economic Research in Las Vegas, commented "People will come to the city just for her and they will spend money and as a consequence, she has an outsized impact on the economy", then adding "Bigger than Elvis, Sinatra and Liberace put together? Definitely.". Estimations indicate that Dion's show will create up to 7,000 indirect jobs and around $114 million worth of new economic activity in each of the three years for which she has been contracted.[279]
In 1999, Dion received a star on Canada's Walk of Fame and also a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in January 2004.[280][281] She dedicated her star to her father, who died the month prior. In 2007, Dion was ranked by Forbes as the 5th richest woman in entertainment with an estimated net worth of US$250 million, though the ranking omitted non-working or retired celebrities.[282][283][284] In August 2008, she received an honorary doctorate in music from the Université Laval in Quebec City.[285] In October 2010, Dion was named a Goodwill Ambassador, a program created by the UN in 1999, sharing this accolade with Oscar-winner Susan Sarandon.[286] Dion also received several state decorations. She was given France's highest award, the Légion d'honneur, by President Nicolas Sarkozy in May 2008.[287][288] On 26 July 2013, Dion was awarded with the Companion of the Order of Canada by the Governor General of Canada and the investiture ceremony was held at Citadelle of Quebec.[289]
Les Productions Feeling Inc., also known as Feeling Inc. or just Feeling, is an artist management company based in Laval, Quebec, Canada and owned by Dion and her husband and manager, Rene Angelil. Dion is also founder of Nickels Restaurant food chain. Dion and her husband also own Le Mirage Golf Club and Schwartz's Restaurant. In association with Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf and Shaquille O'Neal she opened a popular night club called Pure, located at Caesars Palace.
Dion became an entrepreneur with the establishment of her franchise restaurant, Nickels in 1990. She has since divested her interests in the chain and is no longer affiliated with Nickels, as of 1997. In 2003, Dion signed a deal with Coty, Inc. to release Celine Dion Parfums.[290] Her latest fragrance, Signature, was released in September 2011[184] with an advertising campaign by New York agency Kraftworks NYC.[291] Since its inception, Celine Dion Parfums has grossed over $850 million in retail sales.[292][293] In October 2004, Air Canada hired Dion as part of their promotional campaign to unveil new service products and an updated livery. "You and I", the theme song sung by Dion, was written by advertising executives working for Air Canada.[294]
Dion has actively supported many charity organizations, worldwide. She has promoted the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CCFF) since 1982, and became the foundation's National Celebrity Patron in 1993.[295] She has an emotional attachment to the foundation; her niece Karine succumbed to the disease at the age of sixteen, in Dion's arms. In 2003, she joined a number of other celebrities, athletes, and politicians, including Josh Groban and Yolanda Adams to support "World Children's Day", a global fundraising effort sponsored by McDonald's. The effort raised money from more than 100 nations and benefited orphanages and children's health organizations. In addition, Dion has been a major supporter of the T.J. Martell Foundation, the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, and many health and educational campaigns. During the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Dion donated $1 million to the victims of the storm, and held a fund-raising event for the victims of the 2004 Asian Tsunami, which subsequently raised more than $1 million.[296] After the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Dion donated $100,000 to China Children & Teenagers' Fund and sent a letter showing her consolation and support.[297] Since 2004, she is involved, alongside husband René Angelil, with the Québec gay community by supporting the publication of health and HIV prevention materials in Gay Globe Magazine, owned by journalist Roger-Luc Chayer.[298]
Dion first met her husband and manager, René Angélil in 1980, when she was 12 and he was 38, after she and her mother sent him a demo tape of a song they had written. They began a relationship in 1987, and became engaged in 1991. They married on 17 December 1994, at Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal, Quebec. On 5 January 2000, Dion and Angelil renewed their wedding vows in Las Vegas.
In May 2000, Dion had two small operations at a fertility clinic in New York to improve her chances of conceiving, after deciding to use in-vitro fertilisation after years of failed attempts to conceive. Their first son, René-Charles Angelil, was born on 25 January 2001. In May 2010, Angelil announced that Dion was 14 weeks pregnant with twins after a sixth treatment of in-vitro fertilisation. On Saturday, 23 October 2010, at 11:11 and 11:12 am respectively, at St. Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach, Florida, Dion, by Caesarean section, gave birth to two healthy fraternal twins.[299] The twins were named Eddy, after Dion's favorite Algerian songwriter Eddy Marnay who also produced Dion's first five albums, and Nelson, after former South African President Nelson Mandela.[300] Dion appeared with her newborn sons on the cover of the 9 December 2010 issue of the Canadian edition of Hello! magazine.[301]

=======================================================
From humble beginnings in a rural French Canadian home town, Celine Dion has risen to international superstardom like a shooting star. Celine has been called the premier contemporary pop vocalist of the Nineties. She has earned music industry accolades from around the world: Grammy Awards in the US, Juno and Felix Awards in Canada, and a World Music Award recognizing her status as the best-selling female artist of all time. The entire world has seen Celine Dion literally transform herself from a gifted pre-adolescent into an international superstar.
Born in Charlemagne (a small town 30 miles east of Montreal, Quebec, Canada), Celine is the youngest of 14 children of a highly musical family. Her parents, both musicians, operated a small club, and on weekends, the entire family performed and entertained the local population. From the tender age of 5, Celine sang with her siblings and quickly acquired the ability to perform live. At the age of twelve, together with her mother and one of her brothers, Celine composed a French song which would forever alter the course of her life.
The demo tape containing the song was brought to the attention of René Angélil, a well respected personal manager. In January 1981, René was so taken by the voice of the young Celine, that he became determined to make her an internationally known talent - he even mortgaged his house to finance the recording of Celine's debut album!
Celine began to receive recognition for her talent in 1982, winning the Gold Medal at the Yamaha World Song Festival in Tokyo, along with the coveted Musician's Award for Top Performer. In 1983, she became the first Canadian ever to receive a Gold Record in France.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Hailing from the small town of Charlemagne, Québec, Céline Dion has become one of the all-time greatest singers. Céline was born in 1968, the youngest of 14 children. Early in childhood, she sang with her siblings in a small club owned by her parents. From these early experiences, Céline gained the know-how to performing live. At the age of 12, Dion composed a song in her native French and sent it to a record company, where it garnered the attention of René Angélil, a respected manager. Angélil believed in Céline so much that he actually mortgaged his house in order to finance her debut album. Already very popular and successful internationally, Céline burst onto the U.S. stage when she recorded the theme song to Disney's hit Beauty and the Beast (1991). The song garnered a Grammy and an Oscar, and from this point Céline has brought forth hit after hit. Her 'Falling Into You' album, released in 1996, became the best-selling album of that year, selling more than 25 million copies worldwide. In 1999, Dion took a hiatus in order to begin a family. She returned to the spotlight in 2002, releasing yet another hit album. Starting in 2003, Céline began a three-year commitment to perform in an arena built for her in Las Vegas.

      I guess it all depends on your nature. Some people can't stand being alone. I love solitude and silence. But when I come out of it, I'm a regular talking machine. It's all or nothing for me.
      There's always a new thing happening to me that's even more extraordinary, so pressure gets harder. But I like it when it's hard. Anyone can do it when it's easy. When it's hard and you can do it good, you're proud of yourself. There's going to be more pressure as the years go by, that's for sure. But I think I'm a hard worker and I'm ready for that. As long as I believe in what I'm doing, the pressure is okay with me.
      I'll be a Quebecker-Canadian. I'm from Quebec and every time I go to a country I say that. It's my roots, my origins and it's the most important thing to me.
      There's one way to do showbiz, if you want to do it perfectly, you have to be disciplined and you have to be ready to work really hard.
      [People Magazine, 12/3/07] The most important thing I can give to my son is my true values. Whatever choice he makes, I want him to assume his responsibilities and achieve what he wants - and be happy. For me to be able to give my happiness to my son. I cannot achieve better than that.
      [People Magazine, 1994] I don't regret having lost my adolescence. I had one dream: I wanted to be a singer.
      [People Magazine, 12/3/07, on her son seeing her Las Vegas show for the first time] He's the only guy who intimidates me.
      [People Magazine, 12/3/07] My life is to be a mom. It is what I enjoy the most. It is my most amazing reward. I will take a chance with my music. I don't take risks with my family.
      [People Magazine, 12/3/07] I feel like I'm at the bottom of the ladder, finally. I started at the top. I came down. Maturity is being grounded. When you feel grounded you feel strong. I know what I want.
      [People Magazine, 12/3/07] I love performing, but I never really liked show business. My success is my family. I want to be more successful as a mother.
      [on plastic surgery] Three or four years ago, I would have considered it, but not today. Some people have suggested that I have my chin done, but I'm a singer and it could change my voice. I'm not a model whose survival depends on beauty. My job consists of putting the most emotions into my songs. It might be a stupid thing to say, but when I look at my father, my mother and pictures of my grand-parents, I am proud. I wouldn't like to change any of that. Just look at Barbra Streisand! Look at her nose! She is beautiful and she doesn't give a damn about what people think.
      I think it bothers people to see people that are happy and successful. So they try to find what's wrong with them. During my 30 years in show business I've had lots of bad vibes and bad reviews, but between you and me, if that's bad I can go for another 30, just like that. I'm not losing sleep. To me, the most important thing is the response of people who come to see our shows. They're telling me to keep going.
      I've always been an 'open book' when it comes to my fans. They are so loyal to me and give me such great support that I feel I want to share as much of my life with them as I can. They are part of this journey - a big part!
      [on Christina Aguilera] I remember thinking, "This girl's got it all, and then some!" Unbelievable voice, great dancer and so very beautiful. Without a doubt, she's one of the most talented artists the world has ever seen or heard, and I think she's going to continue to amaze us for many, many years to come.

1978Little Girl, Big VoiceAt age 10, Céline Dion, the youngest of 14 children, persuades her parents, butcher Adhémar and housewife Thérèse, to let her perform in the piano bar they open just outside of Montreal. "She'd say, 'I'm going to go out on tour and be the biggest singer in the world,'" her brother Jacques recalls to PEOPLE two decades later of his sister's big dream.1980'Dream' WeaverDion records her first song, "It Was Only a Dream" (penned by her brother Jacques and her mom Thérèse), which Jacques sends to René Angélil, a local manager-producer. Angélil calls the 12-year-old singer in for an audition. "While I was singing he started to cry. I knew then I had done a good job," Dion tells PEOPLE of her fateful meeting with Angélil, who mortgages his house to fund her 1981 debut album, La Voix du Bon Dieu.1985Make Me OverNow famous in Canada and France, the French-language singer, who quits school to focus on her career, has her sights set on becoming a star Stateside. With Angélil's encouragement, Dion learns English and refines her look, including capping her teeth. It was, as Dion's mother later tells PEOPLE, "her transformation from adolescence to a young woman."1988Sealed with a KissWith eight French-language albums under her belt, Dion wins the coveted Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin, Ireland. The event proves fateful in more ways than one: It fast-tracks an English-language record deal for Dion, and marks the turning point in the 20-year-old singer's relationship with the twice-divorced Angélil, 46. "My whole body shook for half an hour," Dion tells PEOPLE of her first kiss with Angélil. "Then he called me and said, 'Are you okay? I'm sorry.' I said, 'No! No! Are you kidding?' It was magic." 1990SeptemberHit ParadeDion releases her English-language debut Unison in America, where her single "Where Does My Heart Beat Now" hits the top 10.

"When you're in love," she explains to PEOPLE, "you want to scream it to the world.'' On Dec. 17, Dion, 26, marries Angélil, 52, in a lavish fairy-tale wedding at Montreal's Notre Dame Basilica. "Keeping her happy is my job," the groom says of his wife and client.1996March 08'Falling' For CélineDion's album Falling Into You – bolstered by the single "Because You Loved Me" – goes on to sell a staggering 10.8 million copies and earns Dion her second and third Grammys for best pop album and album of the year.1997A 'Titanic' YearTitanic director James Cameron didn't initially want a ballad for his disaster-romance, but after hearing Dion's demo of "My Heart Will Go On," he changes his mind. The Grammy- and Oscar-winning track shoots to No. 1, appearing on both her multi-platinum solo CD Let's Talk About Love as well as the Titanic album. "I must be doing something right," Dion deadpans to PEOPLE in 1990, a time when industry insiders estimate her fortune at more than $200 million.2000Family FirstWhen Angélil is diagnosed with throat cancer, Dion takes a career hiatus. "René needed me with what he's been through, and I felt good about it," she later tells PEOPLE. "I can do something good, not only through music, but…I can be his wife. I can make a difference in his life." During Angélil's treatment, Dion simultaneously undergoes fertility procedures, including in vitro fertilization. After 38 rounds of chemo, Angélil gets a clean bill of health, while Dion announces she's having a baby.2001January 25Special DeliveryAt age 32, Dion fulfills a lifelong dream, becoming a mother to son René-Charles, who the new mom says, "is the extension of the love (René and I) have for each other ...René-Charles is everything that we have accomplished together."

=======================================================
Think Twice', 'My Heart Will Go On', an Oscar for the 'Beauty and The Beast' title song. The French Canadian diva is a worldwide hit and she wed the man who discovered her.
Born the youngest of 14 children in rural Canada, Celine Dion came from an extremely musical family. Her parents were both musicians and ran a small club nearby, where the whole Dion family would gather at weekends to perform for the local community.
Dion began singing on stage at the age of five, and by the time she was twelve had written a song in French that would attract the attention of personal manager Rene Angelil, later to become her husband.
Angelil was so convinced of Dio's potential that he re-mortgaged his own house to fund her debut album. By 1983, she had become the first Canadian to receive a gold record in France and in 1984 she added to her already impressive list of achievements a performance for the late Pope John Paul II when he visited Quebec.
In 1988, Dion, already a superstar in her native Quebec, won the Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin and shortly after cemented her international success by releasing the soundtrack to the Disney film Beauty and the Beast. This achievement earned her a number one single, an Oscar and a Grammy.
Her hit album The Colour of My Love and the single from it Think Twice topped their respective charts for five weeks running, the first time this had happened since the Beatles managed it in 1965.
Dion's most famous track My Heart Will Go On from the motion picture Titanic featured both on the album Titanic and Let's Talk About Love, both albums selling twenty-seven million copies each.
In 1999, she decided to take a break from show business to concentrate on her family, and baby Rene-Charles was born in 2001.
2002 saw the return of Celine Dion to the limelight with her album A New Day Has Come. The following year, the singer committed herself to performing five nights a week for the next three years in her own Las Vegas show. The 90-minute extravaganza was held at the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace in a 4,000-seat arena designed especially for her show.
Five consecutive years of sell-out shows followed and after the gig came to an end, she embarked on a year-long tour of the world in 2008-2009. Dion visited 25 countries across five continents and played for millions of fans.
After taking a backseat for a while, family called once more and the star with roots in Charlemagne, a small town near Montreal, started looking into increasing her brood. She became pregnant with her second child, but misfortune struck in 2009 when she suffered a miscarriage.
In February 2010 the star revealed that she had been trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertilisation (IVF). However, the effort did not yield immediate results as Dion underwent four different fertility treatments before a fifth round of IVF finally brought her the outcome she had been looking for.
Twins Eddy and Nelson, named after record producer and family friend Eddy Marnay and former South Africa president Nelson Mandela, were born in 2010. However, their arrival was not without tragedy for the songstress and her husband after they revealed that they had initially been preparing for three. She lost one baby in the early stages of her pregnancy when its heart stopped beating.
Six weeks after they were born, the twins were revealed to the world in December 2010 when they appeared on the cover of Hello! Canada with their mother. In February 2011, Dion and her family arrived in Las Vegas ahead of her return to the Colosseum in Caesars Palace, where a three-year residency for seventy shows a year, beginning on 15 March 2011, was due to begin.
Dion also achieved a new milestone when she performed at the 83rd Academy Awards, a record sixth time she was gracing the stage at the high profile event.

=======================================================
        Rising from humble beginnings to become an international pop star selling more than 100 million albums worldwide, Celine Dion's career spanned '90s superstardom and her more diverse output in the 2000s and 2010s. Born in Charlemagne, Quebec, Celine Dion was the youngest in Adhemar and Therese Dion's family of 14 children. She was raised in a household filled with love for children and music, and her parents and siblings were important figures in the early development of her singing career. Celine began singing in her parents' piano bar when she was just five years old. By age 12, she had written one of her first songs, "Ce N'etait Qu'un Rêve" (It Was Only a Dream), which she recorded with the help of her mother and brother and shipped to a manager named René Angélil, whose name they found on the back of an album by Ginette Reno, a popular Francophone singer. After weeks with no response from Angélil, Celine's brother Michel phoned him and said, "I know you haven't listened to the tape, because if you had, you would've called right away." Angélil dug up the tape and called the family back the same day to set up a meeting with Celine. When the 12-year-old performed in his office in Montreal, Angélil cried and set in motion the process of making her a Québécois, and later, an international, star. He mortgaged his house to pay for her first two albums, producing a local number one single. In 1983 she became the first Canadian to have a gold record in France and she won a gold medal at the Yamaha songwriting competition in Japan. Her worldwide reputation was in the making, but success in the United States was not yet forthcoming.  When she was 18, Dion saw Michael Jackson performing on television and told Angélil that she wanted to be a star like him. Angélil's response was to order her to take 18 months off to remake her image. Dion underwent a physical transformation, cutting her hair, plucking her eyebrows, and having her teeth capped to cover up the incisors that had caused a Quebec humor magazine to dub her "Canine Dion." She was also sent off to English school to polish the language that would help her to break into the American market. When she emerged from this process, she had made an amazing transformation from teen star to adult chanteuse. The payoff came almost immediately. Her 1990 breakthrough album, Unison, was released in the U.S. by Epic Records and produced several hit songs, but it was her duet with Peabo Bryson on the theme song of Disney's Beauty & the Beast that was her true breakthrough.  "Beauty & the Beast" reached number one on the pop charts and won both a Grammy and Academy award. The song was also featured on her second English album, 1992's Celine Dion, which launched another Top Ten American hit with "If You Asked Me To," while spawning two additional Top 40 singles, "Nothing Broken But My Heart" and "Love Can Move Mountains." During this time there were also important developments in Dion's personal life. In 1988, Angélil crossed the line from manager to romantic partner when he kissed Dion one night after a show in Dublin. Fearful that fans would find the 26-year difference in their ages unsettling, the couple kept their relationship a secret for several years. But their 1994 wedding in Montreal's Notre Dame Basilica was celebrated not only by the 250 invited guests, but by millions of fans worldwide. One of the hardest-working stars in show business, Dion continued to record and perform on a schedule that would kill most people. She recorded six albums between 1992 and 1996, when her album Falling into You took her to a new level of stardom. The recording was a runaway hit, winning Grammys for both Album of the Year and Best Pop Album. Another honor arrived in 1996; she was asked to perform at the opening ceremonies of the Atlanta Olympics. Dion's longest tenure on the pop charts would come the following year, however, when she recorded "My Heart Will Go On," the theme song for James Cameron's blockbuster movie Titanic. "My Heart Will Go On" became omnipresent on the radio as Titanic fever swept the world, and when it was featured on her album Let's Talk About Love, it helped propel that recording to the top of the charts. By then, Dion had the power to gather a supporting cast of stars, and the album contained an amazing collection of artists, including Barbra Streisand, Luciano Pavarotti, and the Bee Gees. The album would win a host of awards and bring Dion a whole new world of fans. Her appearance on VH1's Divas Live special with Aretha Franklin, Gloria Estefan, Mariah Carey, and Shania Twain proved popular as well and helped solidify Dion's position, not only among contemporary female pop singers but historical greats like Franklin. The continuing popularity of her recordings and live performances made her 1999 sabbatical seem like a tragedy to her fans, but Dion needed a break after more than a decade and a half at a breakneck pace. In 1999, her husband Angélil was diagnosed with throat cancer. While the disease responded well to treatment and went into remission, the illness was a wake-up call for Dion, who decided to put a new emphasis on her family life and announced a temporary retirement so that she could spend more time at home and have a child. After undergoing fertility treatments, she gave birth to a son in January 2001. The Collector's Series, Vol. 1 was released during Dion's hiatus; it featured many of her best-loved songs, as well as a Spanish-language version of "All by Myself." Dion returned to the public eye in a big way in March 2002 with A New Day Has Come. The album debuted at number one in over 17 countries, and was accompanied by a full-scale media blitz. But Dion's greatest challenge was yet to come. Despite millions of albums sold, the adoration of fans worldwide, and the validation of her peers, Dion's success was still hampered by image problems that had dogged her since the days of "Canine Dion." While many Americans adored her, just as many snickered at her Québécois heritage and the relative unorthodoxy of her marriage. There was also the issue of her relevancy to lucrative audiences existing outside of her pop vocal constituency. To combat these issues, Dion and her management made a series of bold moves that attempted to solidify her career and ensure its continuity as she entered her mid-thirties.  In early 2002, Dion announced a three-year, 600-show contract to appear five nights a week in an entertainment extravaganza at Caesar's Palace, Las Vegas, called A New Day. The production would take place in a custom-built, 4,000-seat theater and would feature Dion as the centerpiece of a multimedia program designed and orchestrated by Franco Dragone, the Belgian theater impresario behind the modern circus phenomenon Cirque du Soleil. The project united Dion, her label Sony Music, Dragone's production company Creations du Dragon, Caesar's parent Park Place Entertainment, and promoter Concerts West in a landmark multi-million-dollar alliance that hinged on Dion's ability to put fans in seats five nights a week for three years. In conjunction with the rollout of A New Day was an endorsement deal with German automaker DaimlerChrysler AG worth additional millions. The campaign placed Dion in a series of black-and-white advertisements promoting the stylish allure of Chrysler's line of upscale automobiles.  The performer also recorded a brand-new song to accompany the spots. Debuting in early 2003, the campaign dovetailed into the March release of One Heart, Dion's first album since 2001's A New Day Has Come, which in turn heralded the opening of A New Day on March 25, 2003. That live Las Vegas show was documented on the summer 2004 release New Day: Live in Las Vegas, which was followed a few months later by Miracle, a collection of family songs designed as a tandem book/CD project between Dion and photographer Anne Geddes. The two-CD compilation On Ne Change Pas appeared in 2005, featuring her most popular French-language songs and a new collaboration with the operatic pop vocal foursome Il Divo, "I Believe in You (Je Crois en Toi)." A new French-language album, D'Elles, arrived in May 2007 and debuted at the top of the Canadian album chart. In November of that same year, Dion released the English-language Taking Chances and announced a tour of South Africa and Europe scheduled for 2008. She released the CD/DVD Taking Chances World Tour: The Concert, as well as the documentary DVD Celine: Through the Eyes of the World. A new French album, Sans Attendre, was released in 2012 and, the following year, her English-speaking fans' six-year wait was rewarded with the announcement of the album Loved Me Back to Life. Heralded by its hip-hop-inflected title track single, the album, released in November, featured duets with Ne-Yo and Stevie Wonder alongside a cover of Daniel Merriweather's "Water and a Flame." ~ Stacia Proefrock, Rovi

Celine DionSingerBorn: 30 March 1968Birthplace: Charlemagne, Quebec, CanadaBest known as: Singer of "My Heart Will Go On," the theme from TitanicCéline Dion has made a career of singing emotional, no-holds-barred pop ballads like "My Heart Will Go On," her Grammy-winning theme to the movie Titanic.  The youngest in a musical family from rural Quebec, Céline Dion started her singing career early.  As a teenager, she was already a popular recording artist in Japan and Europe.  Dion's duet with Peabo Bryson on the Disney song "Beauty and the Beast" catapulted her to international fame.  It was followed by the albums "The Colour of My Love" (1993) and "Deux" (1995). In 1996 the Grammy-winning album "Falling Into You" cemented her reputation for sultry love ballads. In 1998 Céline Dion reached perhaps the peak of her popularity: her album Let's Talk About Love was released along with "My Heart Will Go On," the soaring theme to James Cameron's Oscar-winning romantic drama Titanic (starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet).  After a few years of self-imposed semi-retirement, Dion began a nearly five-year run in A New Day, her own show at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas; Dion did 717 performances of the show from 2003-2007. In 2011 she announced her return to Caesar's Palace for a fresh three-year run.Extra credit: Céline Dion married her manager, Rene Angelil, in December of 1994; he is 25 years her senior... After a much-publicized pregnancy, Céline Dion gave birth to a son, Rene Charles, on 25 January 2001. She gave birth to twin boys, Nelson and Eddy, on 23 October 2010... Céline has had good musical fortune at the movies, with hits from Disney's animated Beauty and the Beast (1991), the 1993 comedy Sleepless in Seattle and Titanic...
