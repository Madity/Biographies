From Chapter One – “I grew up in a world of violence and unpredictability. I learned to protect myself the best I could. I learned to take care of myself because no one else would. I learned to lie, to conceal, and to cover my fear with anger and violence.
No one knew the abuse that went on in our home, as we all learned to keep it hidden. No one knew my wish to make it stop. And later, no one knew the fear that overwhelmed me and drove me to hit and hurt the ones I loved most.”
This book exposes the thinking, beliefs and actions of a child who grows up to find himself being the abuser in his family. We follow his story from before childhood to the beginning of his journey to stop his violent and abusive behaviors.
Lee Cox offers powerful insights into his journey of healing himself. When he shares his story, his courage, candor and honesty inspire his audience to help stop domestic abuse. Lee speaks to: Students, Teachers, Law Enforcement, Domestic Violence Professionals, Civic organizations, Self Help groups and Community Leaders.

Terence Vance "Terry" Gilliam (/ˈɡɪliəm/; born 22 November 1940) is an American-born British screenwriter, film director, animator, actor and member of the Monty Python comedy troupe. Gilliam has directed several films, including Time Bandits (1981), Brazil (1985), The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), 12 Monkeys (1995), and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009). The only "Python" not born in Britain, he became a naturalised British citizen in 1968. In 2006, he formally renounced his American citizenship.
Gilliam was born in Minneapolis, to Beatrice (née Vance) and James Hall Gilliam. His father was a travelling salesman for Folgers before becoming a carpenter. Soon after, they moved to nearby Medicine Lake, Minnesota.[2]
The family moved to the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Panorama City in 1952. Gilliam attended Birmingham High School where he was class president and senior prom king. He was voted "Most Likely to Succeed", and achieved straight A's. During high school, he began to avidly read Mad magazine, then edited by Harvey Kurtzman, which would later influence Gilliam's work.[3]
Gilliam later spoke to Salman Rushdie about defining experiences in the 1960s that would set the foundations for his views on the world, later influencing his art and career:
I became terrified that I was going to be a full-time, bomb-throwing terrorist if I stayed [in the U.S.] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles. [...] In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way. [...] And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy’s foolish daughter. And I said, "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop. [...]
And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.[4]
Gilliam started his career as an animator and strip cartoonist. One of his early photographic strips for Help! featured future Python cast-member John Cleese. When Help! folded, Gilliam went to Europe, jokingly announcing in the very last issue that he was "being transferred to the European branch" of the magazine,[4] which of course did not exist. Moving to England, he animated sequences for the children's series Do Not Adjust Your Set, which also featured Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin.

Gilliam was a part of Monty Python's Flying Circus from its outset, at first credited as an animator (his name was listed separately after the other five in the closing credits), later as a full member. His cartoons linked the show's sketches together, and defined the group's visual language in other media (such as LP and book covers, and the title sequences of their films). Gilliam's animations mix his own art, characterized by soft gradients and odd, bulbous shapes, with backgrounds and moving cutouts from antique photographs, mostly from the Victorian era.
Besides doing the animations, he also appeared in several sketches, though he rarely had any main roles and did considerably less acting in the sketches. He did however have some notable sketch roles such as Cardinal Fang of the Spanish Inquisition, the bespectacled commenter who said "I can't add anything to that!" from the Election Night Special sketch, Kevin Garibaldi (the brat on the couch shouting "I want more beans!" from "Most Awful Family in Britain 1974", Episode 45) and the Screaming Queen in a cape and mask singing "Ding dong merrily on high." More frequently, he played parts that no one else wanted to play (generally because they required a lot of make-up or uncomfortable costumes, such as a recurring knight in armour who would end sketches by walking on and hitting one of the other characters over the head with a plucked chicken) and took a number of small roles in the films, including Patsy in Monty Python and the Holy Grail (which he co-directed with Terry Jones, where Gilliam was responsible for photography, while Jones would guide the actors' performances) and the jailer in Monty Python's Life of Brian.
With the gradual break-up of the Python troupe between Life of Brian in 1979 and The Meaning of Life in 1983, Gilliam became a screenwriter and director, building upon the experience he had acquired during the making of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Gilliam says he used to think of his films in terms of trilogies, starting with Time Bandits in 1981. The 1980s saw Gilliam's self-written Trilogy of Imagination about "the ages of man" in Time Bandits (1981), Brazil (1985), and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988). All are about the "craziness of our awkwardly ordered society and the desire to escape it through whatever means possible."[5] All three movies focus on these struggles and attempts to escape them through imagination; Time Bandits, through the eyes of a child, Brazil, through the eyes of a thirty-something, and Munchausen, through the eyes of an elderly man.
Throughout the 1990s, Gilliam directed his Trilogy of Americana: The Fisher King (1991), 12 Monkeys (1995), and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), which were based on scripts by other people, played on North American soil, and while still being surreal, had less fantastical plots than his previous trilogy.[6]
Well, I really want to encourage a kind of fantasy, a kind of magic. I love the term magic realism, whoever invented it – I do actually like it because it says certain things. It's about expanding how you see the world. I think we live in an age where we're just hammered, hammered to think this is what the world is. Television's saying, everything's saying 'That's the world.' And it's not the world. The world is a million possible things.
As for his philosophical background in screenwriting and directing, Gilliam said on the TV show First Hand[disambiguation needed] on RoundhouseTV: "There's so many film schools, so many media courses which I actually am opposed to. Because I think it's more important to be educated, to read, to learn things, because if you're gonna be in the media and if you'll have to say things, you have to know things. If you only know about cameras and 'the media', what're you gonna be talking about except cameras and the media? So it's better learning about philosophy and art and architecture [and] literature, these are the things to be concentrating on it seems to me. Then, you can fly...!"[7]
His films are usually highly imaginative fantasies. His long-time co-writer Charles McKeown comments about Gilliam's recurring interests, "the theme of imagination, and the importance of imagination, to how you live and how you think and so on [...] that's very much a Terry theme."[8] Most of Gilliam's movies include plot-lines that seem to occur partly or completely in the characters' imaginations, raising questions about the definition of identity and sanity. He often shows his opposition to bureaucracy and authoritarian regimes. He also distinguishes "higher" and "lower" layers of society, with a disturbing and ironic style. His movies usually feature a fight or struggle against a great power which may be an emotional situation, a human-made idol, or even the person himself, and the situations do not always end happily. There is often a dark, paranoid atmosphere and unusual characters who formerly were normal members of society. His scripts feature black comedy and often end with a dark tragicomic twist.
As Gilliam is fascinated with the Baroque due to the historical age's pronounced struggle between spirituality and logical rationality,[9][10] there is often a rich baroqueness and dichotomous eclecticity about his movies, with, for instance, high-tech computer monitors equipped with low-tech magnifying lenses in Brazil, and in The Fisher King a red knight covered with flapping bits of cloth. He also is given to incongruous juxtapositions of beauty and ugliness, or antique and modern. Regarding Gilliam's theme of modernity's struggle between spirituality and rationality whereas the individual may become dominated by a tyrannical, soulless machinery of disenchanted society, film critic Keith James Hamel observed a specific affinity of Gilliam's movies with the writings of economic historian Arnold Toynbee and sociologist Max Weber, specifically the latter's concept of the Iron cage of modern rationality.[10]
Gilliam's films have a distinctive look not only in mise-en-scene but even more so in photography, often recognizable from just a short clip; in order to create a surreal atmosphere of psychological unrest and a world out-of-balance, Gilliam makes frequent use of unusual camera angles, particularly low-angle shots, high-angle shots, and Dutch angles. Roger Ebert has said "his world is always hallucinatory in its richness of detail."[11] Most of his movies are shot almost entirely with rectilinear ultra wide angle lenses of 28 mm focal length or less in order to achieve a distinctive signature style defined by extreme perspective distortion and extremely deep focus. Gilliam's long-time director of photography Nicola Pecorini has said, "with Terry and me, a long lens means something between a 40mm and a 65mm."[12] This attitude markedly differs from the common definition in photography which qualifies 40mm to 65mm as the focal length of a normal lens instead due to resembling natural human field of view, unlike Gilliam's signature style defined by extreme perspective distortion due to his usual choice of focal length. In fact, over the years, the 14mm lens has become informally known as "The Gilliam" among film-makers due to the director's frequent use of it since at least Brazil.[13] Gilliam has explained his preference for using wide-angle lenses in his films:
The wide-angle lenses, I think I choose them because it makes me feel like I'm in the space of the film, I'm surrounded. My prevalent vision is full of detail, and that's what I like about it. It's actually harder to do, it's harder to light. The other thing I like about wide-angle lenses is that I'm not forcing the audience to look at just the one thing that is important. It's there, but there's other things to occupy, and some people don't like that because I'm not pointing things out as precisely as I could if I was to use a long lens where I'd focus just on the one thing and everything else would be out of focus. [...]
[M]y films, I think, are better the second and third time, frankly, because you can now relax and go with the flow that may not have been as apparent as the first time you saw it and wallow in the details of the worlds we're creating. [...] I try to clutter [my visuals] up, they're worthy of many viewings.[14]
In another interview, Gilliam mentioned, in relation to the 9.8mm Kinoptic lens he had first used on Brazil, that wide-angle lenses make small film sets "look big".[15] The widest lens he has used so far is an 8mm Zeiss lens employed on The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.[16]
Gilliam has made a few extremely expensive movies beset with production problems. After the lengthy quarrelling with Universal Studios over Brazil, Gilliam's next picture, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, cost around US$46 million,[17] and then earned only about US$8 million in US ticket sales. The film saw no wide domestic release from Columbia Pictures, which was in the process of being sold at the time.
In the mid-1990s, Gilliam and Charles McKeown developed a script for Time Bandits 2, a project that never came to be made. Several of the original actors had died. Gilliam also attempted to direct a version of Charles Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities, which collapsed due to disagreements over its budget and choice of lead actor.[18]
In 1999, Gilliam attempted to film The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, budgeted at US$32.1 million, among the highest-budgeted films to use only European financing; but in the first week of shooting, the actor playing Don Quixote (Jean Rochefort) suffered a herniated disc, and a flood severely damaged the set. The film was cancelled, resulting in an insurance claim of US$15 million.[19] Despite the cancellation, the aborted project did yield the documentary Lost in La Mancha, produced from film from a second crew that had been hired by Gilliam to document the making of Quixote. After the cancellation, both Gilliam and the film's co-lead, Johnny Depp, wanted to revive the project. The insurance company involved in the failed first attempt withheld the rights to the screenplay for several years[20] but the production was finally restarted in 2008.[21][22]
Gilliam has attempted twice to adapt Alan Moore's Watchmen comics into a film. Both attempts (in 1989 and 1996) were unsuccessful.[clarification needed] Most recently, unforeseeable problems again befell a Gilliam project when actor Heath Ledger died in New York City during the filming of The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.
On the other hand, Gilliam's first successful feature, Time Bandits (1981), earned more than eight times its original budget in the United States alone; Gilliam's infamous box office flop The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988) was nevertheless nominated for four Academy Awards (and won, among other European prizes, three BAFTA Awards); his $24 million-budgeted film The Fisher King (1991) (his first film not to feature a member from Python) grossed more than $41 million at United States box office; and 12 Monkeys went on to take over US$168 million worldwide; whilst The Brothers Grimm, despite a mixed critical reception, grossed over US$105 million worldwide. Gilliam's $30 million-budgeted film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus had also became an international box office success, grossing over $60 million in worldwide theatrical release. According to Box Office Mojo, his films have grossed an average of $26,009,723.
Since his first feature, Gilliam has shown a propensity to work with particular actors in numerous productions. Up until the 1990s, each of Gilliam's non-Python films has featured at least one of his fellow Monty Python alumni (particularly Palin, Cleese, and Idle), and for his finished projects Gilliam has worked with the following actors at least twice (in order of first film appearance):
Charles McKeown (Time Bandits, Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus)
Ray Cooper (Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, The Zero Theorem)
Other recurring collaborators include Gilliam's cinematographers Roger Pratt (Brazil, The Fisher King, 12 Monkeys) and Nicola Pecorini (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, The Brothers Grimm, Tideland, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, The Zero Theorem), and his co-writer McKeown (Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus).
J. K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, is a fan of Gilliam's work. Consequently, he was Rowling's first choice to direct Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in 2000, but Warner Bros. ultimately chose Chris Columbus for the job.[23] In response to this decision, Gilliam expressed that "I was the perfect guy to do Harry Potter. I remember leaving the meeting, getting in my car, and driving for about two hours along Mulholland Drive just so angry. I mean, Chris Columbus' versions are terrible. Just dull. Pedestrian."[24] In 2006, Gilliam added that he found Alfonso Cuarón's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to be "really good...much closer to what I would've done."[25] In retrospect, however, Gilliam has stated that he wouldn't have liked to direct any Potter film. In a 2005 interview with Total Film magazine, he said that he would not enjoy working on such an expensive project due to interference from studio executives.[26]
In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1, director David Yates paid homage to Gilliam's 1985 film Brazil, portraying the Death Eater-infiltrated Ministry of Magic in a fashion reminiscent of Gilliam's totalitarian bureaucracy.[27][28]
In 2002, Gilliam directed a series of television advertisements called Secret Tournament.[29] The advertisements were part of Nike's FIFA World Cup campaign, and featured a secret three-on-three tournament between the world's best football players inside a huge tanker ship, with the Elvis Presley song "A Little Less Conversation" playing during the advertisements.
In 2006, Gilliam directed the stage show Slava's Diabolo created and staged by Russian clown artist Slava Polunin. The show combines Polunin's clown style, characterized by deep non-verbal expression and interaction with the audience, with Gilliam's rich visuals and surrealistic imagery. The show premiered at the Noga hall of the Gesher theater in Jaffa, Israel.
The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, directed and co-written by Gilliam, was released in 2009.[30] In January 2007, Gilliam announced that he had been working on a new project with writing partner Charles McKeown. One day later, the fansite Dreams reported[31] that the new project was titled The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. In October 2007, Dreams confirmed that this would be Gilliam's next project and was slated to star Christopher Plummer and Tom Waits.[32] Production began in December 2007 in London.[33]
On 22 January 2008, production of the film was disrupted following the death of Heath Ledger in New York City. Variety reported that Ledger's involvement had been a "key factor" in the film's financing.[34] Production was suspended indefinitely by 24 January,[35] but in February actors Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell signed on to continue Ledger's role, transforming into multiple incarnations of his character in the "magical" world of the film.[36][37] Thanks to this arrangement principal photography was completed 15 April 2008 on schedule. Editing was completed November 2008.[38] According to the official ParnassusFilm Twitter channel[39][40] launched on 30 March 2009, the film's post-production FX work finished on 31 March. During the filming, Gilliam was accidentally hit by a bus and broke his back.[41]
The film had successful screenings including a premiere at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival. The UK release for the film was scheduled for 6 June 2009 but was pushed back to 16 October 2009. The USA release was on 25 December 2009. Eventually, this $30 million-budgeted film had grossed more than $60 million in worldwide theatrical release.
The director stated his intent to dedicate the film to Ledger.[42] Depp, Farrell, and Law donated their proceeds from the film to Ledger's daughter.[43]
Gilliam made his opera debut at London's English National Opera in May 2011, directing The Damnation of Faust by Hector Berlioz.[44] The production received positive reviews in the British press[45][46][47] On 16 September 2012, the production opened at the Vlaamse Opera in Ghent, Belgium, in the opera's original French-language version and received praise from critics and audiences alike. After a number of performances in Ghent, the production moved to the opera house in Antwerp for sold-out run of performances.
Gilliam has several projects in various states of development, including an adaptation of Neil Gaiman's and Terry Pratchett's comic fantasy novel Good Omens. Other projects Gilliam has been trying to get off the ground since the 1990s are an adaptation of Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities (starring Mel Gibson), an adaptation of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain (which has been adapted into movies several times before), and a script titled The Defective Detective that Gilliam has co-authored with Richard LaGravenese (who wrote Gilliam's The Fisher King before).
It was rumoured that Gilliam may direct – or be involved in the production of – the animated band Gorillaz' movie. In a September 2006 interview with Uncut, Damon Albarn was reported saying "... we're making a film. We've got Terry Gilliam involved."[48] However, in a more recent interview with Gorillaz-Unofficial, Jamie Hewlett, the co-creator of the band, stated that since the time of the previous interview, Damon's and his own fixation on the film had lessened. In an August 2008 Observer interview, Gorillaz band members Albarn and Hewlett revealed the nature and title of the project, Journey to the West, a movie adaptation of the opera of the same name based on a 16th-century Chinese adventure story also known as Monkey.[49] In January 2008, while on set of The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, Gilliam stated that he was looking forward to the project, "But I'm still waiting to see a script!"[38]
The Zero Theorem was a planned feature film project by Gilliam. The science fiction film would have starred Billy Bob Thornton.[50] Participating were producer Richard D. Zanuck and screenwriter Pat Rushin. When little was revealed about the nature of the film writer Pat Rushin suggested that his short story "Vow: A Prolix Parable" was an example of the screenplay's sensibility.[51] An article at film website Tout Le Cine stated the film was to be about a reclusive and tortured data processing genius working on a mysterious project.[52] Production was said to start May 2009. However, in June 2009 Gilliam stated that he had dropped the film having to invest more time than expected in the promotion of the 2009 film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus as well as in preparation for his film of Don Quixote.[53][54] In October 2012, the film was finally shot with Christoph Waltz replacing Thornton.
After regaining the rights to the screenplay of The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, Gilliam restarted pre-production in 2008, with Johnny Depp still attached to the project.[55] The film will be reshot completely, and Rochefort's role will be recast. Michael Palin reportedly entered talks with Gilliam to step in for Rochefort and play Don Quixote.[56] However, Gilliam revealed on Canadian talk show The Hour on 17 December 2009, that Robert Duvall had been cast to play Quixote, before the film was postponed once again.[57] In January 2014, Gilliam published a news on Facebook announcing "Dreams of Don Quixote have begun again".[58]
On 16 December 2010, Variety reported that Gilliam is to "godfather" a film called 1884 which is described as an animated steampunk parody of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, with several former Pythons lending their voice talents to the project whereas Gilliam will be credited as "creative advisor".[59]
During the second half of 2011, Gilliam wrote a screenplay, co-authored by Paul Auster, for a film adaptation of Auster's novel Mr. Vertigo.[60][61]
In July 2012, Gilliam revealed plans for a future film, which would be shot in Bucharest, Romania, but although he denied that it would be Don Quixote, refused to give any details.[62] Actor David Walliams reportedly entered talks with Gilliam to play a part in it, and was told that he'd have to "be willing to work with Johnny Depp and fly to Bucharest where the movie is to be filmed."[63] Depp, so far, has made no mention of his involvement, but was seen in Bucharest around the same time[64] in mid-July as Romanian news outlets reported Gilliam was staying in the city for negotiations on studio work with Romanian film production company MediaPro Studios.[65] On 13 August 2012, this project was officially announced to be The Zero Theorem, set to start shooting in Bucharest on 22 October, produced by Dean Zanuck (son to the late Richard D. Zanuck who was to originally produce in 2009), worldwide sales handled by Voltage Pictures, Toronto and starring Academy Award winner Christoph Waltz in the lead, replacing Billy Bob Thornton who had been attached to the project in 2009.[66][67][68][69][70][71][72] In October 2012, it was reported that David Thewlis and Tilda Swinton had joined the cast.[73]
Gilliam has been involved with a number of charitable and humanitarian causes. In 2009, Gilliam became a board member of Videre Est Credere (Latin for "to see is to believe") a UK Human Rights Charity.[74] Videre describes itself as "give[ing] local activists the equipment, training and support needed to safely capture compelling video evidence of human rights violations. This captured footage is verified, analysed and then distributed to those who can create change."[75] He participates alongside movie producer Uri Fruchtmann, music producer Brian Eno and Executive Director of Greenpeace UK John Sauven.
Gilliam has been married to the British make-up and costume designer Maggie Weston since 1973. She worked on Monty Python's Flying Circus, many of the Python movies, and Gilliam's movies up to The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. They have three children, Amy (b. 1978), Holly (b. 1980), and Harry (b. 1988), who have also appeared in several of Gilliam's films.
In 1968, Gilliam obtained British citizenship, then held dual American and British citizenship for the next 38 years. In January 2006 he renounced his American citizenship.[76] In an interview with Der Tagesspiegel,[77] he described the action as a protest against then-President George W. Bush, and in an earlier interview with The A.V. Club, he also indicated that it was related to concerns about future tax liability for his wife and children.[78][79] As a result of renouncing his citizenship, Gilliam is only permitted to spend 29 days per year in the United States, fewer than ordinary British citizens.[77] Gilliam maintains a residence in Italy near the Umbria-Tuscany border. He has been instrumental in establishing the annual Umbria Film Festival,[80] held in the nearby hill town of Montone.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Terry Gilliam was born in Minnesota near Medicine Lake. When he was 12 his family moved to Los Angeles where he became a fan of Mad magazine. In his early 20's he was often stopped by the police who often suspected him of being a drug addict and Gilliam had to explain that he worked in advertisement. Gilliam said these experiences made him understand how it was like to be Black or Mexican and gave him sympathy for the poor. In the political turmoil in the 60's, Gilliam feared he might develop into a terrorist and decided to leave the USA. After moving to England he landed a job on the children's television show Do Not Adjust Your Set as an animator. There he would meet his future collaborators in Monty Python: Terry Jones, Eric Idle and Michael Palin. In 2006 he renounced his American citizenship.
        Was first known for the bizarre animation sequences in Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969) using cutout pictures and photographs.
        Heroes in his films often dream of a woman who they have not yet met, but will meet during the course of the film. In the dream, the woman's face is obscured.
        [Television monitors] They were in Brazil (1985), Twelve Monkeys (1995), The Fisher King (1991), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) and Time Bandits (1981).
        Frequently casts Jonathan Pryce, Katherine Helmond,Michael Palin, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Robin Williams, Johnny Depp, Jeff Bridges, Christopher Plummer, Peter Stormare and Tom Waits.
      Founding editor of and principal contributor to campus humor magazine, "Fang", at Occidental College in Los Angeles, CA in the early 1960s.
      He started to direct "The Man Who Killed Don Quixote" in 2001 (in Spain) with Johnny Depp, Vanessa Paradis and Jean Rochefort but the shooting was unfortunately stopped a couple of days after it started because of numerous factors including storms, lack of financing, and Jean Rochefort's health problems (he couldn't ride a horse any more). There is a documentary based on the struggle in production entitled "lost in la mancha".
      During the filming of Brazil (1985) he became so stressed that he temporarily lost the use of his legs, which only returned to normal several weeks later.
J.K. Rowling, creator of the "Harry Potter" book series, originally wanted Gilliam to direct Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001), but Warner Brothers studios wanted a more family friendly film and eventually settled for Chris Columbus.
      Turned down the opportunity to direct Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), Enemy Mine (1985), and Forrest Gump (1994) and Alien: Resurrection (1997).
      Has been off and on to write and direct a movie adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons's graphic novel "Watchmen." Gilliam has said he attempted to write an accurate screenplay but it would be unfilmable, but he would consider directing it if it were made into 10 or 12-part cable television series.
      Was slated to direct an adaptation of the novel "Good Omens" by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. The project languished in development for three years before finally being abandoned.
      Directed a series of TV ads for Nike in 2001. They were part of The Scorpion Knockout Campaign, which featured some of the best soccer players on the globe. That campaign went to win a Cannes award in 2002, in the category of Best TV Campaign.
      Also turned down directing Braveheart (1995), when briefly solicited by Mel Gibson to direct an abandoned film version of Charles Dickens's "A Tale of Two Cities".
      He did not originally intend to cast Sean Connery as King Agamemnon in Time Bandits (1981), he merely wrote in the screenplay that when Agamemnon took off his helmet that he looked "exactly like Sean Connery." To Gilliam's surprise, the script found its way into Connery's hands and Connery subsequently expressed interest in doing the film.
The Fisher King (1991) was the first film that he directed in which he was not involved in writing the screenplay.
      He and John Cleese are the only members of 'Monty Python' to be nominated for Oscars. Coincidentally, they were both for Best Original Screenplay, Gilliam for Brazil (1985) and Cleese for A Fish Called Wanda (1988). Both screenplays did not win their Oscars, and both films featured Michael Palin.
      Was offered the chance to direct Troy (2004). He stopped reading the script 5 pages in and declined the offer.
      Member of the comedy group "Monty Python" along with John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Eric Idle and Graham Chapman. Gilliam also created the animations.
      Four of his films are in the Criterion Collection - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), The Fisher King (1991), Brazil (1985), and Time Bandits (1981).
      As of 2010, has directed three actors in Oscar-nominated roles; Brad Pitt (Twelve Monkeys (1995)), Robin Williams, and Mercedes Ruehl (The Fisher King (1991)). Ruehl won her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.
      As a result of renouncing his American citizenship, he is only permitted to spend 29 days a year in the United States, considerably less than the average U.K. Citizen.
      There's a side of me that always fell for manic things, frenzied, cartoony performances. I always liked sideshows, freakshows. Jerry Lewis was a freakshow...Absolutely grotesque, awful, tasteless. I like things to be tasteless.
      People in Hollywood are not showmen, they're maintenance men, pandering to what they think their audiences want.
      To be deemed to be OK, to be part of the culture, that's the kiss of death. When I'm pushing against something it helps me define what I believe. I've always been led to see what's beyond, what's round the corner. The world tries to say that this is what it is, and don't go any further, because out there are monsters. But I want to see what they are. So when I talk about the others in the group not having done more, that's because I really admire them, and I get angry when I see those with extraordinary talents not using them.
      I am getting tired of these fights [with backers.] Each time you get into a fight the world closes in a bit. You start losing an innocence, a belief that everything is possible. Terry Jones thinks I'm belligerent and egotistical, and that I've got to get into a fight to keep me going. It does keep me awake. But I limit it to the fights that are worth it nowadays.
      All I do is hunt. I want to be thrilled. And I'm not being thrilled at the moment. So I'm being old and bitter and curmudgeonly, because I want sensory buzz and I'm not getting it!
      I think I've got a certain talent and I don't know how to defend it. So I end up defending it more vociferously than it may need, but I always feel under threat. It's a basic in-built paranoia. When people start interfering, I go a little bit crazy.
      Hollywood is run by small-minded people who like chopping the legs off creative people. All they want to do is say no.
      I do want to say things in these films. I want audiences to come out with shards stuck in them. I don't care if people love my films or walk out, as long as they have a strong response.
      My problem is I'm like a junkie. I want a good movie fix, and I never get that fix. I want to be taken into some place, some world, some idea that I haven't thought of or imagined. And it doesn't happen.
      It happens with every film. There comes a part where the money and the creative elements all come crashing together. Everybody's under a lot of pressure, and everybody is panicking about what works and what doesn't. And the studios and the money always have one perspective and the creative people have another one, and usually what happens is a lot of compromises get made.
      (on future use of CGI in his films) "Nooo! Leave that to George Lucas, he' s really mastered the CGI acting. That scares me! I hate it! Everybody is so pleased and excited by it. Animation is animation. Animation is great. But it's when you're now taking what should be films full of people, living thinking, breathing, flawed creatures and you're controlling every moment of that, it's just death to me. It's death to cinema, I can't watch those Star Wars films, they're dead things."
      Whether I like it or not, or whether anybody else does, when I start a film I have a few ideas. And as you're getting into it, you think, 'Ooh, there's another idea,' and you're shooting some more and, 'Oh, here's another thing. Let's do that.' I'm always changing and adding. That's just the way my mind works.
      Everybody has their opinion and some people are wrong. One of the things I enjoy about my films is that children really love them. They are open-minded. As we get older we seem to close in. We limit the size of the world we limit everything about it. We have to break that shell open sometimes and (The Brothers Grimm) is just a desperate attempt to do so.
      "My main concern is to protect the film, and sometimes even I can get in the way of the film. If I'm causing a problem for the ultimate film, then I've got to be stopped, and I tell this to everybody who works with me. They find it hard to believe, but they finally do say, 'Terry, you can't do it.'
      I think there's a side of me that's trying to compete with Lucas and Spielberg - I don't usually admit this publicly - because I tend to think that they only go so far, and their view of the world is rather simplistic. What I want to do is take whatever cinema is considered normal or successful at a particular time and play around with it - to use it as a way of luring audiences in.
      The more successful I get, the more the onus of having to get it right wants to settle on my shoulders alone, but I just hate that, I freeze up. I want everyone to share my responsibility, the guilt, and I'll shoulder the blame, because that's my job in the end.
      It's hard for me to worry about the studios losing money. I'm not very sympathetic to their money problems, because they certainly haven't been sympathetic to mine.
      In the end, people have to learn to live together. That is what I didn't like about America - it is so homogeneous. I like places where there are people who are different culturally, physically, in every way. And I like to see how they succeed in living together.
      While filming The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009): We were devastated. We spent the whole day - Amy Gilliam, Nicola Pecorini, the director of photography, and myself - lying flat on the floor. Heath Ledger's dead, and you don't quite get over that. I suppose I'm in an interesting position because while I'm cutting the film I'm basically working with him every day and he's fine; he's in good shape.Ideas are floating around. Then finally we decided, 'OK, let's get three other people to take over the part'. And we were lucky because we have a magic mirror in this movie. Not every movie has a magic mirror. So you can very genuinely say that these other actors are different aspects of the character that Heath plays. And it works. The point was, we've got to keep going. It was a bit like half being there, but apparently on autopilot I can still do a few things.
      Nobody went to see Tideland (2005)! I was hoping people would get angry about it but those that saw it didn't want to talk about it. This is the world we're living in, people don't want to discuss things that are actually worth discussing.
      The reason why I don't watch as many as I used to is that I'm not surprised any more. I loved movies because they opened up doors into worlds I never imagined. It seldom happens now.
      On his conflict with Universal over Brazil (1985): The first thing was that they wanted a happy ending. Then they decided that the theme of the film was 'love conquers all'. So they started cutting out all the fantasy stuff.It's one thing to argue about whether you need that scene or whether it can be a bit shorter. It's another to say, 'Let's tell a different story'. And at that point I said, 'Whoa, it's time to go to war'.The [Hollywood] studio's mentality is that Americans are stupid. They try to lower the standard as much as they can to reach what they think is this great dumb audience. And I have always resisted that and wanted to believe in the audience's intelligence. But if you keep feeding people baby food for long enough they begin to like it.
      I won't be getting an Academy Award - I'll predict that - ever. And somehow, my life will be no less for that!
      I've always liked gossip, gossip is fun, but whether you believe it or not is something else, and yet the web seems to want to believe. The web doesn't distinguish between what's playful and serious. And the speed! What is happening in the web, and all the tweeters tweeting, they become neurons. They are the neurons of the global village. Village is the right word because the village is where the gossip is taking place, it doesn't take place in the cities. A piece of information comes into that little neuron - whoop - and they've immediately got to pass it across the synaptic gap... a big leap into the next neuron... - [he makes a rocket sound] - Whoosh! And off it goes! Off it goes into the next neuron. We're watching the brain in action, worldwide. The brain is a very simple thing, and the web is the neural structure of our brains, I'm convinced of it.... See, Hollywood was always like that. Agents have to be available 24 hours a day, because they are the neurons of the system and whatever information hits them, they're off to the next one with that information, there's no secrets in Hollywood... -- on the advancement of gossip on the web
      I find that what I do is reactive, so if I'm living in London I'm angry most of the time about the state of the world. When I go to Italy I get all blissful. I've never done any creative work there except building stone walls. I just wander around looking at birds and leaves. It's peace. -- on his house in Italy
      The first subversive thing I did was in junior high school, when I was "head of ground patrol" - in other words the local cop. There was a long corridor, and someone was running down it. I was talking to my friend and it was one of those moments, I just put my foot out and he tripped and went flying. I don't know why I did it. I think I didn't like the guy. There was something about the way he was running - I thought, what an asshole.
      It depends who you talk to. If you talk to people who have worked with me, they'll say, he's the right guy to work with, he knows what he's doing, responsible... If you talk to Hollywood, they think catastrophes, disasters - he's a magnet for trouble.' If it's easy, I don't do it; if it's almost impossible, I'll have a go. -- on what others in the business say of him
      I thought this one would be a piece of cake, to get 25 million with Heath Ledger on board (for 'The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'). You would think that there's intelligent life in Hollywood. But then you discover that there's just fear. People are frightened of making decisions or even having - I hate to use the word "vision", but they lack all of that. Hollywood is run by Goldman Sachs and not by entrepreneurs or studio people. It's the bankers who look at the numbers, and Tideland, my previous film, made very little money, and Heath did even worse with a film called Candy. And that's what they look at. Somehow the whole place has been taken over by middle management, like the rest of the Western world. And bureaucracy has settled in very comfortably.
      For me, the only reason to try and make my films successful is that it will be more likely that I'll get the next project off the ground.
      (on finishing The Man Who Killed Don Quixote (2011)): If you're going to play with Quixote you really got to play with Quixote. And those were windmills that came along. Those were giants, they killed us once but we're going to come back. Everybody says 'Oh, forget about it, put it in the past. Move on.' No, I won't because that all sounds so reasonable and I don't think films should be reasonable. The business we're in is about exciting people, stimulating people, doing things, changing them, outraging them -- it's not a reasonable business. Especially when you're spending the gross national product of a country to make a silly movie -- this is not reasonable.
      (on Jeff Bridges) If it were up to me, I would cast Jeff in every movie I make. He is that good, such a joy to work with too. He has a large fan base as well, but these guys are real cult-fans, they are dedicated, but they don't run around screaming at premieres for "more Jeff Bridges!". The studios, they don't get this. They don't think he's bankable at all, but he is. It's frustrating, I think, but so very typical.
      My life is about waiting for money. My life isn't about filmmaking -- that's not what I do. It feels incidental to what I do, which is hunt for the money, cast movies and re-cast them and try to get projects going or stop them from falling apart. I spend my whole time repressing everything inside of me until I get the money to work, and then I just go. I'm on autopilot until I get the chance to go on a set.
      [on current Hollywood blockbuster movies] You just sit there and watch the explosions. I couldn't tell you what the movie was about. The movie hammers the audience into submission. They are influenced by video games, but in video games at least you are immersed; in these movies you are left out. In films, there's so much overt fantasy now that I don't watch a lot because everything is possible now. There's no tension there. People can slide down the side of a building that's falling and they don't get ripped to shreds? The shots are amazing, but if there is no consequence, no gravity, what's the point? I can't watch Hollywood movies anymore. There's no room for me.
      [on filmmaking]: So we create a world that isn't true to a realistic naturalistic world, but is truthful.
      [on voting as a member of AMPAS] I just vote for my friends, or do it whimsically, or out of spite in some cases.

Gender: Male Born: November 22, 1940 Birthplace: Medicine Lake, Minnesota, USA Nationality: United Kingdom 
For most of Terry Gilliam's early career, fans of the popular comedy show Monty Python's Flying Circus assumed that he was British, since Python's other five members were natives of Britain. But the innovative animator and future director, who spent more time behind the scenes than in front of the camera, was actually the troupe's only American member. Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on November 22, 1940, Gilliam was briefly employed as an assistant editor for {-Help!} magazine (a job that introduced him to English comedian John Cleese, who was in NYC posing for a comic photo-strip in the magazine); he then emigrated to England in 1967. Soon after gilliam arrived in the U.K., he began working on Do Not Adjust Your Set, a popular children's TV show, developing his eccentric animated cartoons, which put into motion a hodgepodge of images, including photographs, cutouts from magazines, and famous works of art. Gilliam's contributions to the show were geared more toward adults, as his surrealistic stream-of-consciousness segments, drenched in black humor, were beyond the grasp of most children.In 1969, Gilliam was asked by Cleese and others to join the absurdist comedy troupe Monty Python. In addition to writing for Monty Python's Flying Circus, Gilliam also contributed his animated interludes, for which he was pretty much left to his own devices; the other Pythons just told him how much time he needed to fill and never gave him any narrative direction. Gilliam began offering his iconoclastic vision to moviegoers with the comedy troupe's first original film, Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), which he co-directed with fellow Python Terry Jones. An instant cult classic, the movie contained all the requisite Python elements: absurdist humor, self-referential parody, and extremely quotable dialogue. The following year, Gilliam had his first outing as a solo director with Jabberwocky (1976). Based on the poem by Lewis Carroll, the film featured a medieval setting similar to that of <I>Holy Grail</I> and starred Pythonite Michael Palin. Along with Python's brand of irreverent humor, the film featured glimmers of the visual resplendence that would become the director's trademark. But critics found it awkward and repetitive, and audiences largely stayed away. 
Following Jabberwocky's relative failure, Gilliam regrouped with his fellow Pythonites, co-creating The Life of Brian, the tale of a man with the misfortune of being confused with Jesus Christ. He left the directing duties to Terry Jones, focusing on animation, screenwriting, and acting. Gilliam returned to directing with Time Bandits (1979), a surreal journey through history led by a small boy and several dwarves. Bearing many similarities to Jabberwocky, Time Bandits relied less on repetition and moved the audience more briskly from one scene to the next. It did well at the box office and put Gilliam in the ranks of directors to watch.After co-directing with Terry Jones the third and final Python film, Monty Python's the Meaning of Life (1983), Gilliam made what many people consider his masterpiece, the dystopian satire Brazil (1985). Instead of journeying back to the Middle Ages, Gilliam boldly predicted a retro-1930s future of anonymous office drones commanded by an all-powerful computer. Blindingly imaginative, the film starred Jonathan Pryce as Sam Lowery, who attempts to escape the stifling bureaucratic system by fantasizing about being a superhero, and later by actually battling the powers-that-be in his own cowardly fashion. Consistently blurring the line between fantasy and reality and uncompromising in its surreal eccentricity, Gilliam's masterwork has been called Orwellian, Kafkaesque, and Luddite. A failure at the box office, Brazil has made up for that disappointment with its cult status. In addition to critical praise and a Los Angeles Film Critics award for Best Film, Gilliam received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay.It was four years before Gilliam stepped behind the camera again, for The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1989). Returning to historical fantasy, Gilliam tells the unlikely tales of the title character as though they really happened. The Baron explores the inside of a volcano, takes a hot air balloon to the moon, gets swallowed by a whale, and quells a war that he himself started. Munchausen's stories were less well known to most Americans than to audiences in Britain, where the film won British Academy Awards for Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and Best Costume Design.Gilliam followed <I>Munchausen</I> with his most accessible work to date, 1991's The Fisher King. Foregoing much of his usual ornate visual style, the director focused on characters rather than flashy spectacle; the relationships among a depressed former DJ (Jeff Bridges), his enabling girlfriend (Mercedes Ruehl, in an Oscar-winning performance), and a homeless man (Robin Williams) who saves him from suicide are intertwined in a riveting, funny, and ultimately heart-warming way. Gilliam balances humor, pathos, and story-telling, while avoiding mawkishness. He received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Director, and the movie won the Silver Lion Award at the Venice Film Festival.Gilliam returned to the director's chair in 1995, achieving his biggest  box office hit with the science fiction epic 12 Monkeys. Starring Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, and Brad Pitt (in an Oscar-nominated performance), the movie tells the story of a prisoner from the future sent back in time to save the world from a catastrophic virus. But the scientists of 2035 haven't quite mastered the art of time travel, and they accidentally send Bruce Willis' character back to 1990 instead of 1996. The film was a critical and commercial success despite its hard-to-follow plot, allowing Gilliam the freedom to take even more creative risks. His next project, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), an adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's 1971 novel, was the ultimate "trip" movie. Detailing Thompson's drug-addled journey to the gambling capital of the world, it starred Johnny Depp as the author's alter ego, Raoul Duke. The movie was the perfect vehicle for Gilliam to create an alternate universe fueled by the mind-bending substances in which the lead characters freely and plentifully indulge. With melting faces, a lounge full of human-sized lizards, bats flying in the desert, and a demon with breasts on its back, the movie didn't need and didn't really have a plot. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was the definition of a love-it-or-hate-it movie.In 2000, the director began working on Good Omens, a comedy/fantasy based on the book Good Omens: or, The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, a humorous story about the apocalypse. That endeavor fell by the wayside, however, when Gilliam attempted to film his lifelong dream project, <I>The Man Who Killed Don Quixote</I>, in late 2000. From injured actors to faulty props to inclement weather conditions, the $30 million shoot became a textbook example of Murphy's Law, and was shut down despite pleas from the haggard director. In 2003, however, the project found new, unexpected life in Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe's {/documentary} Lost in La Mancha, a comic tale of cinematic defeat. Intended as a "making-of" featurette to be included on the finished film's DVD, the documentary chronicled the morose fate of Gilliam's botched production in all of its painful, hilariously unbelievable glory, and became a minor art-house attraction. Gilliam subsequently fought to buy back the rights to <I>The Man Who Killed Don Quixote</I> in light of all the renewed interest, but it remained to be seen whether the director would get a chance to finish what he started. Gilliam realized his dream of adapting Don Quixote for the screen in 2002 with the release of the long-awaited Lost in La Mancha, and worked with Natalie Portman and Heath Ledger in 2009’s The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus. ~ Eric Bloch, Rovi

1. Brazil. In our opinion this is the best Terry Gilliam film. Brazil is a vision of a dark totalitarian future based around the bureaucratic information industry where all roads lead to a dead end, where a hero must make his way. Brazil is a modern masterpiece of imagination. It is also visually absolutely stunning, where everything looks huge, played against the minutiae of the paper chase going on at Sam's workplace. If you are looking to buy this film go for the 3 disc edition by Criterion which includes everything you would want to know about this superb movie. Brazil read our full review
2. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Truly only Gilliam could have made this film work. To bring the madness and majesty of Hunter S. Thompson's drug addled journalistic memoirs so atmospherically to the big screen is nothing short of a miracle. The performances that he coaxed out of Johnny Depp and Beniccio Del Torro was a masterstroke. The story of a road movie was irrelevant, but hey, what a journey.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas read our full review 
              3. Jabberwocky. Terry Gilliam's earliest solo directorial movie played on similar ground to the Holy Grail that he co-directed with Terry Jones - i.e. the filth and mundane madness of medieval Englande. But what we get here is the tell tale marks of Gilliam's dark imagination and genuinely bizarre sense of humour given full reign to tell a story of a young peasant's quest to make his fortune and return to marry his childhood sweetheart Griselda Fishfinger - bless.  Jabberwocky read our full review 
All the Terry Gilliam's films are available in our alt-flix Terry Gilliam stores in association with Amazon.com. 
It has been announced that Terry Gilliam's latest movie The Zero Theorem will be premiered on 2nd September at the Venice Film Festival ahead of its' general release in December 2013. The films' home page is here The Zero Theorem. The film is described thus: "A sci-fi movie that features a socially inept computer genius who delves into a perplexing project to discover the very purpose of existence itself", and stars Christoph Waltz, 
   Matt Damon, Mélanie Thierry, David Thewlis and Tilda Swinton. We are desperate to see a trailer, but we'll have to make do with Gilliam's typically spirited message despatched from comic-con. 
Terry Gilliam was born Terrence Vance Gilliam on 22nd November 1940 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. An avid artist and cartoon drawer from an early age led to working on his college magazine and eventually working for Help magazine. It's during this time that he met and first worked with John Cleese (in the US with Graham Chapman with The Cambridge Circus Review) on a spoof photo story for the magazine. In 1967 after some time traveling and working in both Europe and America, Terry headed to London again working on a magazine. 
He contacted John Cleese (who was then working on the satirical TV show The Frost Report) on the off chance that Terry could submit some cartoons or comedy sketches for the show. John put him in touch with team behind the TV comedy series Do Not Adjust Your Set that contained Eric Idle, Michael Palin and Terry Jones, and Terry Gilliam was contracted to provide some "Stream of Consciousness" cartoons for the series. When Do Not Adjust Your Set finished its run Cleese, Chapman, Idle, Jones, Palin and Gilliam came together in the late spring of 1969 to work on the TV series Monty Pythons Flying Circus. The series was phenomenally successful and would run for 45 episodes from 1969 to 1974 (and in 1971 would spawn a feature film called And Now For Something Completely Different - effectively a cinematic reworking of the best sketches from the first two television series). A considerable part of the show's success was the animations that Terry Gilliam provided to help link the whole episodes together. 
When the Monty Python TV series finally came to an end, the team decided to chance their arm on the big screen. In 1975 Monty Python and The Holy Grail went into production with Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam co-directing. The co-directing experience was never a comfortable one with a small budget, difficult conditions (re-creating medieval England), pressure for the film to be made quickly playing against Terry Gilliam's desire for the film to look visually stunning. The film was well received but Gilliam was already keen to move on and be able to pursue his own vision without the compromise of working with a team. 
In 1977 came the first feature film directed solely by Terry Gilliam. Jabberwocky, again set in Medieval England, was loosely adapted by Terry from the poem by Lewis Carroll. Free from the constraints of working under the Python banner (even though the starring role of Dennis is played by Michael Palin and it also features a cameo by Terry Jones) Gilliam's ability to bring the medieval times stunningly to life is beautifully achieved here. Whilst the film was unable to surpass the comedic heights of Python, and with maybe a hint of style of content, it was deemed a successful debut feature. 
A stint back with the Python team lead to the delightfully controversial Life of Brian (1979) . Keen to avoid the problems encountered on Holy Grail, Terry Jones was chosen to direct freeing up Terry Gilliam to supply the considerable animations, guide the art direction and also act out multiple grotesque characters on screen. Life of Brian was a huge success despite, and perhaps partly because of, the controversy.
First came Terry Gilliam's next directorial feature film. The acclaimed Time Bandits (1981) was a film written by Gilliam and Michael Palin telling the story of a little boy unhappy with his home life who accidentally joins a band of time traveling dwarves whose sole intent is traveling through various times in history and stealing it's treasure. It is here that Gilliam's fantasy / fairy tale aesthetic, that would go on to be the back bone of his future work, is truly realised for the first time. 
Terry would rejoin the Pythons for some live shows in the US that culminated in the movie Live at The Hollywood Bowl (1982). 1983 saw the full Python team together for the last time for their final feature film The Meaning of Life with the main directorial duties again going to Terry Jones with Terry Gilliam taking the reigns for the special sequences and animations. One of these sequences originally intended to come near the end of the film was The Crimson Permanent Assurance. This segment caught the imagination of Gilliam to such an extent that it ran hugely over time (its run time tripling) and over budget (over a million pounds over budget - which hampered the budget for the rest of the movie). In the end the segment was so long it no longer fitted into the movie and was instead made into the supporting feature. 
1985 saw the release of the next Terry Gilliam film in the form of futuristic black comedy Brazil. A film about an office worker dreaming of love, whilst living in world drowning in bureaucratic red tape under a totalitarian regime. Whilst not being a huge commercial success, its scope and imagination saw Terry Gilliam's artistic reputation enhanced even further, whilst a row with studio bosses who wanted the film re-cut for a happy ending in order to make the film more saleable, also led Gilliam to be viewed by some of the film industry as awkward and un-realistic. This would all seem like crying over spilt milk when compared to Gilliam's next film.
The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988) seemed ideally suited to Terry Gilliam. The story of the mythical Baron Munchausen, famed teller of great tales (or more accurately fanciful lies). Set in Baroque Europe, the film was hopelessly under budgeted and in efforts to get the film completed the budgets ended up being massively increased. This led to the perception within the industry that Gilliam was out of control and had little regard for the studio's money, whereas previously he had enjoyed a reputation for making expensive looking films for relatively small (particularly in Hollywood terms) amounts of money. Though a financial disaster, the film gained much critical praise for its stunning visuals (which garnered no less than 4 Oscar nominations). 
1991 saw the release of Gilliam's next film entitled The Fisher King. A much more mainstream proposition than any of his previous films, and with the criticism of Munchausen still ringing in his ears, The Fisher King allowed Gilliam to demonstrate that he could bring in a film under budget, make it look fantastic and make it a commercial success, all of which were achieved (along with some Oscar wins and nominations along the way). 
With his reputation substantially restored his next movie was Twelve Monkeys (1995). Based on the legendary 1960's flick La Jetee, the story revolves around a convict sent back from the future (where society has been wiped out by a mutated virus), to the past, in the hope that the virus can be obtained and prevented from mutating. With the studio fully behind the project and two mega stars heading the action (Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt) the film was a commercial and critical hit which further enhanced Gilliam's bankability.
1998 saw the release of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Based on the legendary writings of gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson, Fear and Loathing had long been thought impossible to bring to the movie screen. The previous directorial incumbent was Alex Cox who had to be relieved of his duties and Gilliam was drafted in to replace him. What he produced was very faithful to the drug addled writings it was based on and is a cult favourite with many progressive discerning film lovers, but given the nature of the story a wholesale mainstream hit was never likely to be on the cards. It is certainly the most uncompromising of Gilliam's work and it is hard to imagine anyone else even attempting a film of this nature, let alone achieving such amazing results. 
Like many times in his post Munchausen career, Gilliam's thirst for making films has come into conflict with both studios and the movie backers, and the years after Fear and Loathing saw projects muted that he could not get backing for. None is more widely documented than his attempt in 2000 to make a film of The Man Who Killed Don Quixote. This was something of a dream project for Gilliam and after lots of starts, stops, delays, and procrastination from the backers the film finally began shooting. After months of pre-production work being completed i.e. sets, models and costumes etc the shooting commences, but after only a couple of days the film is beset with technical hitches and even disasters (like the set being washed away in a flash flood). The film backers got cold feet and despite the money already spent, the film is unable to be resurrected. This is all documented in Lost in La Mancha which I would heartily recommend watching. 
2005 saw Terry Gilliam back onto familiar ground with The Brothers Grimm. The story is a fictional take on the live's of fairy tale collectors, Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm. Gilliam's return to the screen seemed pretty much low key. The classic fairy tale / fantasy element was brought to life superbly with a very interesting script, but what did let the film down a bit was the cgi which was not as "perfect" as you would expect from a Gilliam film. 
Also released in 2005 was Tideland a dark and disturbing tale about a young girl who goes to live in the country when her mother dies. She spends her days living in a fantasy world talking to her dolls heads. Elements of the story are reminiscent of Alice Through The Looking Glass (which is visually alluded to in parts of the film) and the whole movie flows slowly and beautifully between her reality and imagination. It marks something of a departure for Gilliam as the scrubland and natural vistas play a huge part in this film and it has the feeling of an Indie movie rather than a Hollywood one. 
2009 saw Terry Gilliam finally become part of the establishment, when he was awarded the Academy Fellowship by BAFTA. Long overdue perhaps, but in Britain true mavericks a very rarely recognised, so it is a mark of how truly deserved the he received the award was in only his 38th year  of his cinematic career. 
Released in October 2009 was The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. Its' screenplay by Gilliam and Charles McKeown (the same team that came up with Munchausen and Brazil)   is a sprawling tale full of imagination and mystery concerning a traveling theatre company traveling through magical realms. It has superb cast including Johnny Depp, Heath Ledger, Colin Farrell, Jude Law, Tom Waits and Mark Benton (not bad for a film with such a small budget of $30m) alongside relative newcomer Lily Cole (who judging by her performance in Sally Potter 's Rage can become, has all the natural talent to become, if she choses, one of the best actresses of a generation). Heath Ledger death at a time when much of the filming had been done forced Gilliam into a decision whether to reshoot but decided to keep the existing footage and have Depp, Farrell and Law portray versions of Ledgers transformations through time. It went down well at Cannes where it received a 13 minutue ovation. 
Gilliam's 2011 Italian set short film entitled The Wholly Family, slipped out almost un-noticed with the rumours of the "Don Quixote" film abounding and rebounding. A beautiful film that served to remind (if any reminding were needed) us of Gilliam's tremendous strength as a director. 
Terry Gilliam is undoubtedly the most creative and imaginative film director (and lets face it story teller) working in cinema today. From his early days working with the Pythons right up to his recent works his imagination and scope has continually pushed at the boundaries (and sometimes the budget) of what can be achieved in movie making. Is he is a modern day Michelangelo (the 16th Century artist rather than the ninja turtle) or a modern day Brother Grimm? - probably both. He is undoubtedly a genius and his films continue to astound and surprise (not an easy achievement in the modern world). 
His attention to detail is also an amazing quality in his work. What particularly stands out for me is his unique style, the use of the wide angle lenses (like Kubrick) allow him to beautifully bring to life the (bigger) picture to such an extent it's like watching an old master at work. Added to this is his propensity towards the fairy tale ethic of storytelling that continually challenges and guides us masterfully through his movies. Here's hoping for many more films from him in the future.

=======================================================
  Terrence Vance Gilliam was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 22 November 1940. His family lived on the city's rural outskirts until 1951, when they moved to California, settling near Los Angeles. The proximity of Hollywood reinforced Gilliam's early fascination with cinema, which had been fuelled by science fiction and animated films; radio, however, was his most creative influence, together with comic books and magazines. His student years saw him as the editor of Fang, Occidental College's satirical journal. After majoring in Physics in 1962, Gilliam left LA for New York, securing a job as assistant editor on Harvey Kurtzman's magazine, Help.
A stint in advertising and as a freelance illustrator followed, but the turning point came in 1967, when Gilliam moved to London and was introduced to television producers. After collaborating on sketches and animation pieces for a number of comedy shows, in 1969 he joined Monty Python's Flying Circus, the ground-breaking BBC series characterised by subversive and surreal humour. Gilliam's ambitious, fantasy-led work was ideally suited to Python, providing the bizarre animated sequences which greatly contributed to the show's cult appeal.
The next breakthrough came as Python made the leap to the big screen, with Monty Python and the Holy Grail  (1974) affording Gilliam his first directing role, which he shared with fellow Python Terry Jones. An irreverent take on the Arthurian legend, the film combined narrative and visual surrealism with a realistic approach to medieval mise en scène, a style maintained by Gilliam in his solo directorial debut, Jabberwocky (1977). This film bore little resemblance to its original inspiration, Lewis Carroll's poem, but allowed the director to further explore his vision of the Middle Ages as a Western-like world filled with clear archetypes. Protagonist Dennis Cooper, forced to abandon his dreams by society's powers that be, epitomised Gilliam's key preoccupation, the crushing of the individual by a soulless system; Jabberwocky bore Gilliam's signature on its script and special effects, as do all his subsequent films.
Time Bandits (1981) expanded the theme of embattled individuality by placing a child's vision at its core: the film's hero, Kevin, lives a fantasy life in opposition to his parents' conformist, materialistic values. The victory of fantasy over reality, another favourite subject of Gilliam's, is expounded in Kevin's alliance with six time-travelling dwarfs, relentlessly pursued by The Supreme Being, the heartless creator of a bureaucracy-driven universe. Gilliam's next work was The Crimson Permanent Assurance (1983), a short film placed at the beginning of Monty Python's The Meaning of Life: featuring a group of elderly, exploited accountants, it charts their rebellion against corporate power, and their transformation into a gang of pirates spreading terror through the world of finance.
Farcical elements are still present in Brazil (1985), a dystopian odyssey set in the future, but they are used by Gilliam to highlight his vision of a society dominated by censorship and bureaucracy: pervasive propaganda posters, designed in the idealised, happy-family style of 1950s American adverts, urge citizens to spy on their neighbours. The result is a highly disturbing film, where protagonist Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) vainly tries to escape the clutches of totalitarianism, machinery, and conformity. Gilliam's well-documented struggle to maintain an unhappy ending, against the producers' wish, enhanced the status of both director and film; together with the dense narrative, dream-world imagery, and gloriously monstrous visuals, it gained Brazil its reputation as the quintessential Gilliam film. Critical recognition matched the film's popular success, with awards from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay in 1985, as well as two Oscar nominations.
Gilliam's next and last British film, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), acquired a different distinction, as this time the director's grandiose imagination was out-stripped by production costs. A lavish, large-scale rendition of the classic tale, including a whole Turkish army and a journey to the moon, Munchausen rapidly ran into huge debts; although critically praised and nominated for four Oscars, it was given a limited release and lost money.
Gilliam's status as auteur has been assured by his strikingly idiosyncratic style, recurrent themes, and insistence on control of all stages of filmmaking. An open hostility towards the studio system has complemented his criticism of mainstream American culture, pragmatically sealed by a thirty-five-year residence in Britain. While he has had to turn to his native country to finance his most recent films, he has continued to denounce Hollywood as an accessory to the 'lie' lived by American society; accordingly, he has declined the direction of many a US box-office hit.
In Britain as elsewhere, Gilliam's directing skills have been at times overshadowed by the stunning impact of his visual creations: he remains best known as a visionary maker of fantastic worlds, monsters, and machines. Likewise, critics and audiences have tended to overlook the outstanding performances given by his actors: Jonathan Pryce and Robert De Niro in Brazil, John Neville and Robin Williams in Munchausen, to name but a few.
Following a long film-making spell in the USA, where he made The Fisher King (1991), Twelve Monkeys (1995) and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), Gilliam returned to Europe to make The Man Who Killed Don Quixote. The film collapsed after its leading actor fell ill and although a documentary (Lost in La Mancha (d. Keith Fulton and Lou Pepe, 2002)) has been made outlining Gilliam's ideas, he has not been able to re-launch the project and is now working on an adaptation of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett's Good Omens.
