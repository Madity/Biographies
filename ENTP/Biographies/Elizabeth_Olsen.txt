She is best known for her roles in the films Silent House, Liberal Arts and the critically acclaimed Martha Marcy May Marlene, for which she was nominated for numerous awards.[1][2][3] She is the younger sister of actresses and fashion designers Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen.
Olsen was born and raised in Sherman Oaks, California, the daughter of Jarnette "Jarnie" (née Jones;[4] b. 1954), a personal manager, and David "Dave" Olsen, a real estate developer and mortgage banker.[5] Elizabeth is the younger sister of twins Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen who became famous as TV and movie stars at an early age. Her oldest brother is named Trent Olsen, and she has two younger half siblings as well. The Olsens have Norwegian ancestry on their father's side.[6][7]
In 1995, Olsen's parents filed for divorce proceedings.[8] Her father remarried McKenzie. From her father's second marriage to McKenzie, she has a younger half-sister, Courtney "Taylor" Olsen, and a half-brother, Jake.
As a child, Olsen received ballet and singing lessons.[9] She began acting at a very young age, with appearances in her sisters' films. Before the age of eleven, Olsen had small roles in How the West Was Fun and the straight-to-video series The Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley.[3] Having appeared in her sisters' videos, when she was in the fourth grade, Olsen began to go on auditions for other projects.
She attended Campbell Hall School in North Hollywood, California from kindergarten through grade 12. After graduation, she enrolled at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. In 2009, Olsen spent a semester studying in Moscow, Russia at the Moscow Art Theatre School through the MATS program at The Eugene O'Neill Theater Center.[10]
Olsen began acting when she was four years of age and co-starred in six of Mary-Kate and Ashley's productions; she also auditioned for the film Spy Kids.[11] She almost quit acting in 2004 due to the media frenzy surrounding Mary-Kate's eating disorder.[12]
Olsen's breakout role came in 2011, when she appeared in the critically acclaimed film Martha Marcy May Marlene. Olsen was nominated for and won numerous critics awards for her portrayal of the titular character Martha, a girl suffering from delusions and paranoia after fleeing her life in a cult and returning to her family. She next appeared in the horror movie remake Silent House, in which she played the role of Sarah, and appeared in the music video "The Queen" by Carlotta.[13] Olsen filmed the movie Red Lights during mid-2011, and it was released in the U.S. on July 13, 2012.[14] She starred in Josh Radnor's film Liberal Arts, which was released on January 22, 2012.[15] She and Dakota Fanning starred in Very Good Girls, a 2013 release.[16][17]
In January 2013, Olsen was nominated for the BAFTA Rising Star Award.[18] She co-starred in the 2013 American remake of the 2003 South Korean film Oldboy; she played Marie, a young social worker who developed a relationship with the protagonist, played by Josh Brolin.[19] Olsen played Edie Parker, Jack Kerouac's first wife and the author of the Beat Generation memoir "You'll Be Okay", in Kill Your Darlings (2013).
Olsen starred in the 2014 Godzilla remake, opposite Bryan Cranston and Aaron Taylor-Johnson.[20][21] Olsen signed on to play the Scarlet Witch in Avengers: Age of Ultron, the 2015 sequel to The Avengers.[22][23] She first appeared as the character in a mid-credits scene of the film Captain America: The Winter Soldier.[24]
Olsen attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts and the Atlantic Theater Company and graduated in March 2013 after six years of intermittent study.[25][26] Her sisters' clothing line "Elizabeth and James" was named after her and her older brother.[10]
Olsen has been dating fellow actor Boyd Holbrook since 2012 after meeting on the film Very Good Girls. In March 2014, the couple became engaged.[27][28]

          Elizabeth Olsen was born and raised in Sherman Oaks, California, the daughter of Jarnette "Jarnie", a personal manager, and David "Dave" Olsen, a real estate developer and mortgage banker. Elizabeth is the younger sister of twins Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen who became famous as TV and movie stars at an early age. Her oldest brother is named Trent Olsen, and she has two younger half siblings as well. The Olsens have Norwegian ancestry on their father's side.
      Elizabeth was born to Jarnette, a former Dancer with the LA ballet, and David Olsen, a mortgage broker in Los Angeles. She is well known as the little sister of Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen and she has an older brother, Trent Olsen.
      A graduate of NYU Tisch School of the Arts and the Atlantic Theater Company Acting School in NYC.
      When she was growing up, her favorite actress and role model was Michelle Pfeiffer. She got to meet Michelle while she was on the set of I Am Sam (2001).
      Worked with Aaron Taylor-Johnson on three different films in two years - Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Godzilla (2014) and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015).
      [on Martha Marcy May Marlene (2011)] Sean Durkin really wrote a complex character that really hasn't been written, and that's challenging. It's such a smart way of writing, you totally understand the characters and I was just completely obsessed and in love with "Martha" and the script.
      When I was 14 or 15, I was a really good volleyball player, so I thought, 'Well, maybe I'll just get a scholarship to an Ivy League school through volleyball.' Then I quit when I decided to focus on theater.
      If you don't like something, talk about something else that's great and maybe someone else will discover it and think it's great too.
      And I think in theater, people don't really focus on the media unless there's a huge superstar doing a play or something.
      I don't know about you, but my girlfriends have been my girlfriends forever, and they're my sisters and my family.
      I auditioned equally for film and theater. The difference is that theater has seasons, while film, it's always happening.
      I had a great drama teacher in high school, and that's when I started to learn about the history of theater.
      I find acting conservatories really important. I've gone to four different ones, and all of them provided totally different tools for me.
      I believe that you are only in control of so much. So whatever you are not in control of you can't worry about.
      I also want to go to an Italian island and do cuisine properly with some famous Italian chef and, like, his mother.
      Everyone is always surprised by how old I am. They think I'm older, but it's always been that way. I'm the youngest of four - maybe you grow up quicker because you just watch the big people.
      I've never read a young adult novel, though. I'm sure I would love it, but I've never read one.
      I think a lot of films do themselves a disfavor by putting in way too much information, and everyone knows what's gonna happen next, and no one can actually discover things as they go.
      I never understood why anyone would do magazines. Like, why would someone put their face out there so much? It's because those people reading magazines will go see the movie, so you do it.
      But I have a list of books that I want to read before I die, and whenever I get time to read something that isn't a script, I'll read something from that.
      And at NYU, I went to the Atlantic Theater Company, and they have two main points. One of them is to always be active in something instead of just feeling it. And the other is figuring out your character.
      What keeps you confident in a healthy way is knowing that everyone else around you is going to support you and teach you and you're going to learn from them. I just feel open to learning from people.
      Movies are in a much longer production conversation before an actor is even involved. I always thought of actors as the last piece of the puzzle - so you're a tool.
      I've only done one shoot where it's modeling clothes, not like me in my environment. And the stylist, literally, I had her stand behind the photographer and do poses.
      I was embarrassed that I even wanted to become an actress because coming from L.A., with two older sisters in the business and a mom who had been a ballet dancer, it was such a cliché.
      I've been really interested in how people's physicality can manipulate their emotions, as opposed to emotions manipulating someone's physicality.

The sister of the famous twins Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen, Elizabeth Olsen learned the ropes of acting by hanging around the set of Full House. She also opted to learn her craft in a structured setting, enrolling at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University and performing with the Atlantic Theater Company. Eventually turning her attention to on-camera acting, Olsen made waves with her film debut, playing a woman attempting a normal life after living in a cult in the 2011 drama Martha Marcy May Marlene. The performance earned the actress much acclaim as well as numerous award nominations, and she followed its success with a role alongside Robert De Niro and Sigourney Weaver in Red Lights, and by taking the lead in the America remake of Silent House. ~ Cammila Collar, Rovi

=======================================================
Elizabeth Olsen was never a stranger to fame. Born in Los Angeles, California, Olsen is the younger sister of celebrities Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, break-out stars from the TV show Full House.
Having appeared in her sisters' videos, when she was in the fourth grade, Olsen began to go on auditions for other projects. By the time she was ten Elizabeth landed a small role in a local commercial. However the auditions came at a price. Olsen found she had less time for other interests: ballet and sports. She decided to quit acting.
By age 16, Olsen began studying Russian theater, which resparked her interest in acting. In 2009, during her sophomore year, Olsen became the understudy for the Nicole Halladay character in the Broadway show Impressionism.
It was during this time that the youngest Olsen sister met her agent. Together they decided that theater would be the path for Elizabeth. This decision was partly motivated by the way the media had treated her older sisters after they had been thrust to the spotlight as babies. 
However, Olsen still auditioned for movies, landing her first role six months after she began. The role was Zoe, Catherine Keener's character's daughter in Peace, Love and Misunderstanding. As she was preparing to begin filming, she came across the script for Martha Marcy May Marlene. After falling in love with the script and being cast as the main charactera young girl escaping from a cultOlsen drove back and forth between both sets until filming was completed on both.
After Martha Marcy May Marlene, Olsen focused on smaller films like Silent House, Liberal Arts and Red Lights. More recently, she starred in Godzilla (2014) and in The Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015).

"They're my sisters. They're great people. I love my family; we're very close. But we do very different things."- Elizabeth Olsen
                Ask most people what they know about Elizabeth Olsen, and they’ll likely tell you that she’s Mary-Kate and Ashley’s younger, far-less-famous sister, if anything at all. But after 2011's star-making turn in the Sundance hit Martha Marcy May Marlene, Olsen is one of the most coveted young actresses in Hollywood, with seven feature film appearances under her belt since her 2011 debut. She’s already the most talented of the Olsen sisters, and is on her way to being the most famous too.            
                Unlike her ultra-famous twin sisters, Elizabeth “Lizzie” Olsen has spent the majority of her 22 years away from the spotlight. While Mary-Kate and Ashley perfected the art of being famous just 'cause, the equally stunning Lizzie -- whose otherworldly eyes and svelte physique are unmistakably Olsen -- has laid the groundwork for a bone fide movie career. In fact, Olsen has done such a great job of laying low that we don’t even know if and who she’s dating, an anomaly in our tabloid-heavy culture. In fact, Olsen’s career has been so pitch perfect that we can only assume she’s studied everything her sisters have done over the years, and just did the opposite. Pretty and smart! 
                Elizabeth Olsen has come a long way since her days as a ringer in her sisters’ generic straight-to-video movies. In fact, it’s safe to say the youngest Olsen girl eclipsed her millionaire sisters’ entire cinematic oeuvre in little under two years in the biz. With buzzy performances in the Sundance darlings Silent House, Martha Marcy May Marlene, Olsen became one of the breakout stars of 2011. Even more impressive, she did it with total autonomy from her sisters. Olsen appeared in a number of indie films in the past two years, some of which were major flops and others such as 2012's Liberal Arts that managed to charm the critics. Major box office success shouldn't be too far off for the rising star however, as her media visibility undoubtedly rose after being cast in Spike Lee's remake of Oldboy and will continue to rise with her upcoming roles in Warner Bros. Pictures' Godzilla and Avengers: Age of Ultron.            
                If Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen were trying to groom their younger sister to follow in their footsteps, they only half succeeded. Though Elizabeth Olsen spent much of her youth hanging out on the set of, and sometimes even appearing in her mogul sisters’ regrettable direct-to-video series, The Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley, she decided to carve her own path in show business, rather than rely on her famous family’s clout. Olsen studied theater as a kid and would later graduate from the Atlantic Theatre Company and NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, the same school that her sisters dropped out of. So while her sisters have eschewed acting for careers in fashion, Elizabeth Olsen has emerged as the best cinematic hope for the family.elizabeth olsen breaks out at sundanceEvery year, Sundance gives rise to a group of relative unknowns whose performances, scripts or directorial efforts in under-the-radar films catapult them to the forefront of the film industry. This year, Elizabeth Olsen -- who starred in not one but two of the most talked-about films at the festival -- headed that list. Her powerful performance in Martha Marcy May Marlene as a disenchanted former cult member seeking to reintegrate herself back into society was made all the more remarkable by her lack of experience on-screen. The former theater student (Olsen did children’s theater and high-school plays growing up in L.A.) had only two films under her belt when Martha Marcy May Marlene premiered: Silent House, which also had its premiere at Sundance, and Peace, Love, & Misunderstanding, a low-budget indie that has been shelved until later this year. But it’s her performance in Martha Marcy May Marlene -- which led to comparisons to a young Maggie Gyllenhaal -- that has Hollywood abuzz, especially after the film performed equally as well at this year’s Cannes.elizabeth olsen becomes one of the most in-demand young actresses in hollywoodElizabeth Olsen may have spent the majority of her life living in the shadows of those pesky Olsen twins, but she's already won the critics' approval with her indie performances and is now moving on to conquer the mainstream film world.Don’t worry, Mary-Kate and Ashley.

(Warner Bros. | The Internet)We can't say specifically what it is because it would be rude to spoil the surprise, but Godzilla delivers one of the year's most memorable big screen moments. It is a moment of supreme awesomeness that will have fans talking for years, and will undoubtedly influence large-scale big budget movies to come. It's a moment so big and grand that almost no one in the screening I attended could hold back some form of appreciation. And this is about what it felt like to...Read Full Story
About 45 minutes into Godzilla, we cut to a giant monster eating a nuclear submarine stuck in a tree somewhere in O'ahu. It's funny because it's a visual pun (submarine sandwich, get it?). It's awesome because this monster looks big, overwhelming, and real. It's a Godzilla movie because about 15 minutes later this thing is getting its ass handed to it by the King of Monsters.
We don't see that showdown, though. In fact pretty much all the monster shots leading up to the third act are just...Read Full Story
