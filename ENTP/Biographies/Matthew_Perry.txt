Matthew Langford Perry (born August 19, 1969) is a Canadian-American actor. He is well known for his Emmy-nominated role as Chandler Bing on the popular, long-running NBC television sitcom Friends. He also received acclaim for his portrayal of Ron Clark in the television movie The Ron Clark Story, accompanied by another Emmy nomination as well as a Golden Globe nomination.[1][2] Perry also starred in the short-lived series Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and has appeared in a number of films, including Fools Rush In (1997), The Whole Nine Yards (2000), and 17 Again (2009).[3] In 2010 he expanded his resume to include both video games and voiceover work when he voiced Benny in the role-playing game Fallout: New Vegas.[4]
Perry was the co-creator, co-writer, executive producer and star of the short-lived ABC sitcom Mr. Sunshine, which ran from February to April 2011.[5] In August 2012, Perry began starring as Ryan King, a sportscaster, on the NBC comedy Go On. The series was cancelled on May 10, 2013.[6] In December 2013, it was announced that Perry would be starring, co-writing, and executive-producing a remake of The Odd Couple. Perry will play Oscar Madison, a known slob.[7] Perry is also going to make his UK TV comedy debut in the one-off Sky Arts comedy The Dog Thrower to be shown in May 2014.[8]
Perry was born in Williamstown, Massachusetts. His mother, Suzanne Marie (née Langford), is a Canadian journalist and former press secretary to Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and his father, John Bennett Perry, is an American actor and former model.[9][10][11] His parents divorced before his first birthday and his mother subsequently married Keith Morrison, a broadcast journalist.[10] Perry was raised by his mother in Ottawa, Ontario, and was enrolled at Rockcliffe Park Public School and Ashbury College.[10] While growing up, he took a keen interest in tennis and became a top-ranked junior player.[10]
Matthew Perry moved from Ottawa to Los Angeles to pursue acting. For high school, he attended The Buckley School in Sherman Oaks. While at Buckley, Perry was featured as George Gibbs in Our Town and appeared as a junior in a production of The Miracle Worker. Patty Duke attended and praised the young Perry's convincing role as Helen's brother Jimmy. He was also featured in The Sound of Music as a junior. In his senior year, director Tim Hillman had planned a production of "The Elephant Man" specifically to feature Perry as John Merrick along with Vanessa Smith, and future Les Misérables star Lisa Capps. He then got his professional break at age 18. On being cast in A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon with River Phoenix, Perry withdrew from Elephant Man and ended his high school acting career. Perry also pursued improv comedy at the LA Connection in Sherman Oaks while still in high school, quickly becoming a featured performer.[12]
After some guest appearances in mid 1980s television, it was his intention to enroll at the University of Southern California, but when he was offered the lead role of Chazz Russell in Second Chance he became noticed on the acting scene. Perry originally starred alongside Kiel Martin when the series premiered in 1987, but after 13 episodes the format changed: Second Chance became Boys Will Be Boys, Perry was elevated to top-billing status, and the plots re-focused on the adventures of Chazz and his teenage friends. Despite the shift, the show ran for only one season. When it concluded, Perry stayed in Los Angeles and made guest appearance on the television program Growing Pains in which he portrayed Carol's boyfriend who dies from injuries in the hospital sustained in a drunk driving accident.[12]
In the midst of his many continuing guest roles on TV, Perry was cast as a regular on the 1990 CBS sitcom Sydney, playing the younger brother of Valerie Bertinelli's title character. In 1991, he made a guest appearance on Beverly Hills, 90210 as Roger Azarian. Perry landed his next TV starring role on the ABC sitcom Home Free, which aired only 11 episodes in the spring 1993. By then, Perry was making his mark, and was instantly cast in a new dramatic pilot titled LAX 2194. The project was slow to take off, so as a backup option, he attempted to secure an audition for the pilot Six of One, later to be known as Friends, by Marta Kauffman and David Crane, both of whom he had worked with on Dream On. However, due to previous commitments to the pilot LAX 2194, he was not initially considered for an audition. When he did eventually get a reading, he landed the part he is best known for, the role of Chandler Bing.[12]
The program was hugely successful and Perry, along with his co-stars, gained wide renown among television viewers. The program also earned him Emmy[13] nominations in 2002 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series along with Matt LeBlanc, but he lost to Ray Romano. As well as his successful career on Friends, Perry has appeared in films such as Fools Rush In (alongside father John Bennett Perry and Salma Hayek), Almost Heroes, Three to Tango, The Whole Nine Yards (alongside Bruce Willis) and its sequel The Whole Ten Yards, and Serving Sara.[12]
While known primarily for his comic roles, Perry has carved out a career in drama as well, particularly in his portrayal of Associate White House Counsel Joe Quincy in Aaron Sorkin's The West Wing. His three appearances in that series (twice in the fourth season and once in the fifth) earned him two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series in 2003 and 2004. Perry is referred to in the show prior to his guest appearance - Donna Moss seeks him out (off screen) in the episode "20 Hours in LA." He also appeared as attorney Todd Merrick in two episodes near the end of Ally McBeal's five season run, including a 2-hour special intended to revive the legal comedy-drama.[12]
After Friends wrapped up, Perry made his directorial debut in an episode of the 4th season of the American comedy-drama Scrubs, in which he also guest starred as "Murray Marks", an operator of a small airport's traffic control team. Murray is asked to donate a kidney to his father Gregory (played by Perry's real father).[12]
He starred in the TNT movie, The Ron Clark Story which premiered August 13, 2006. Perry played small town teacher Ron Clark who relocates to the toughest class in the country. Perry received a Golden Globe nomination as well as an Emmy nomination for his performance.
In 2006-2007, Perry appeared in Aaron Sorkin's drama Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. Perry played Matt Albie alongside Bradley Whitford's Danny Tripp, a writer-director duo brought in to help save a failing sketch show. Perry's character was considered to be substantially based on Sorkin's own personal experiences, particularly in television.[14]
In 2006 he began filming Numb, a film based on a man suffering from depersonalization disorder. The film's tentative release date was pushed back several times, but was finally released to DVD on May 13, 2008. He also appeared in David Mamet's Sexual Perversity in Chicago in London.[15] In 2009 he starred in the film 17 Again playing the older Mike O'Donnell.
In 2008, Perry starred in the offbeat film Birds of America as Morrie Tanager, an uptight man who has to deal with his siblings.
Showtime passed on a pilot called The End of Steve, a dark comedy starring, written and produced by Perry and Peter Tolan.[16]
Perry's new comedy pilot, Mr. Sunshine, based on Perry's original idea, was bought by ABC.[17][18] Perry was set to portray a middle-aged man with an identity crisis.[19] ABC canceled the series after nine episodes.[20][21]
On March 1, 2012, it was reported that Perry had signed on to star on the NBC comedy pilot Go On, written and produced by former Friends writer/producer Scott Silveri.[22] The project was picked up to series in May 2012. Perry portrays Ryan King, a charming yet irreverent sportscaster who tries to move on after the death of his wife through the help of mandatory therapy sessions. The pilot aired on August 8, 2012, as a "sneak preview" post the 2012 Summer Olympics.[23] The series premiered on September 11, 2012.[24] On October 2, 2012, NBC ordered a full season of 22 episodes.[25] The series was cancelled by NBC in May 2013, shortly after the conclusion of its first season.
In 2012, Perry guest-starred on the critically acclaimed CBS drama The Good Wife, as attorney Mike Kresteva. In 2013, he reprised his role in the fourth season. [26]
In December 2013, it was announced that Matthew Perry is starring, co-writing, and executive-producing a remake of The Odd Couple. The multi-camera comedy will start airing sometime in 2014 at CBS. Perry will play Oscar Madison, a known slob; the role of his clean freak roomie Felix Unger was given to Thomas Lennon, who had previously worked with him on 17 Again (as Ned Gold, Mike O'Donnell's (Matthew Perry) friend) and on Friends (as Joey's (Matt LeBlanc) identical hand twin).[7][27] Perry's Go On co-star Sarah Baker will also join him in the show. Baker will play Oscar’s assistant Sam, who spends most of her work day on the phone apologizing to assorted high-and-mighty people who have been offended by Oscar’s latest rant.[28]
In 2014, Perry will also make his British TV debut in the one-off comedy program The Dog Thrower, which is set to air on May 1 as part of Sky Arts' Playhouse Presents strand. Perry will play "a charismatic man" who enchants onlookers by throwing his dog in the air. The strand will include eight standalone comedy and drama programmes. The Dog Thrower will also star Tim Key, and is written by author and journalist Jon Ronson, who also makes his directorial debut.[29]
Perry has reportedly dated Julia Roberts, Yasmine Bleeth and Lauren Graham.[30][31] He dated actress Lizzy Caplan from 2006[32][33] to 2012.[34]
Perry completed a 28-day program in 1997 for a Vicodin addiction. Matthew Perry's weight fluctuated drastically over the next few years and once dropped down to 145 pounds (66 kg). He lost 20 pounds in 2000 due to pancreatitis.[36] Perry again entered rehab in February 2001 to treat an addiction to opioids (specifically vicodin and methadone), amphetamines and alcohol.[37][38][39] Perry was in Dallas, Texas, filming Serving Sara with Elizabeth Hurley when he had such severe stomach pains that he called a local doctor, who advised rehab. Perry flew to Los Angeles and checked into Marina del Rey's Daniel Freeman Hospital. Perry's publicist Lisa Kasteler confirmed his rehab stay.[37]

      I learned to fall down early in life - I was like six - because I realized it was a way to make girls laugh.
      [on originating the show 'Mr. Sunshine'] Some of it is based on me. I like to think I'm a little less selfish than this character, but at times in my life I certainly have been that way. I've been accused of not really paying attention to a sentence unless my name comes up in it twice.
      When I did 'Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip' I would look over and see Aaron Sorkin pacing around in the corner of the stage, mumbling to himself. I thought, Well, he's crazy. And then I realized what he was actually doing was playing out the next week's scenes as he was writing them. And that was intriguing to me. So now I've become one of the people that mumbles in the corner of the room.
      [on his sports-based series 'Go On'] Whenever I come across a famous athlete, I'm shameless. I'll just ask them to be on the show. To my face they've all said yes so far.
=======================================================
Known forever as the loveable Chandler in the hit US show 'Friends', Matthew Perry is an actor with a gift for comedic timing. Whether he will shake off the memory of the character that bought him such fame (and wealth) is yet to be seen but one thing's for sure – his efforts as a director, and theatre star since Central Perk closed its doors, prove he's not ready to wave goodbye to Hollywood just yet.
Born in America, Matthew Perry was raised in Canada, where his mother worked as a press secretary to the then Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau.
At school it soon became clear that he had a natural talent for tennis and had high hopes of pursuing a professional career as an athlete. But after losing an important tournament in 1984 his dreams turned sour and he decided to turn his back on tennis for good.
The same year he moved to Los Angeles to live with his father, an actor, and, although still interested in tennis, he joined the high school drama club.
Just one week after college graduation, he was offered the lead in a Fox sitcom called 'Second Chance' which was later cancelled. Putting faith in Perry's abilities, Fox conjured up another sitcom, 'Boys Will Be Boys', around the would-be star, but this also failed.
Perry then began to appear as a guest on a series of TV programmes, ranging from Michael Landon's 'Highway to Heaven', to Aaron Spelling's 'Beverly Hills 90210'.
His big break was to come when he was 'discovered' in true Hollywood fashion, while skipping university classes and hanging out in a restaurant. His waitress delivered the sixteen-year-old a napkin with the telephone number of director William Richert, who wanted to audition him for a movie. Though sceptical, Perry obligingly called Richert and later accepted a small part, opposite River Phoenix, in 'A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon' (1988).
In 1993, he tapped into his savings and began writing his own TV comedy and one year later sold the pilot to Universal Television. Titled 'Maxwell's House', Perry's programme was based on group of six caffeine-charged attractive twenty-somethings, who moaned about their jobs, relationships, and getting old.Sounds familiar? NBC thought so too, when Perry and Universal pitched them the show. The network declined the pilot because it was already developing a similar sitcom, called 'Friends'.
Although they didn't want his programme, NBC and the producers of 'Friends' did want Perry, and they cast him as Chandler. 'Friends' debuted to immediate success in 1994, and its six co-stars shot to international stardom.
Like the other cast members, Perry has capitalised on his success and attempted to move into the world of the big screen, but after starring in several films including 'Fools Rush In' (1996) with Salma Hayek and 'The Whole Nine yards' (2000) alongside Bruce Willis, he's yet to achieve acclaim away from the shadow of Chandler.
And his success has not been without strife. During his time working on 'Friends', Perry became reliant on alcohol to fuel him for the day and following a jetski accident in 1997 he became addicted to the prescription drug, Vicodin, which led to a spell in rehab. In 2000 he was taken to hospital suffering from pancreatitis, which was onset because of his addictions. 'Friends' fans will have noted that Perry's weight fluctuated dramatically during the years the series was filmed – most notably in the seventh series where he had lost 20 pounds following his hospitalisation. He has been in and out of rehabilitation centres ever since and was lucky that the 'Friends' filming schedule was often altered so that his scenes were shot last. 
The media and Hollywood bigwigs haven't been deterred though and Perry also branched out during his time on the number one sitcom to take roles in other hit US series, 'Ally McBeal' in 2002 and 'The West Wing' in 2003.
After 'Friends' finally wrapped up in 2004, ten years after it first aired, Perry made his directing debut in an episode of the hit American comedy 'Scrubs', in which he also guest starred as a character who has to donate his kidney to his father, played by Perry's real father, John.
Having already worked on 'The West Wing' to critical applause, its creator Aaron Sorkin approached Perry with his script for 'Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip' in 2006, an insider look at a 'Saturday Night Live'-type sketch show. He jumped at the chance to return to an ensemble cast again and the series ran for a year until 2007, with the buzz and overall success largely attributed to Perry’s return to regular series work.
Meanwhile, Perry earned additional critical kudos for his performance in 'The Ron Clark Story' (2006). The TNT movie was based on a true story about a school teacher who relocated from the Deep South to the tough inner city New York. He received Golden Globe and Emmy award nominations for his dues.
With the directing and acting door still firmly wedged open for him, who knows what the future holds for Perry but it's unlikely he'll bow out of the limelight for many years to come.
=======================================================
							"I desperately  desperately  needed the money," said Matthew Perry in 1997. He was talking about the reason he had taken the $10,000-an-episode role of neurotic Manhattanite Chandler Bing three years previously in the sitcom Friends. You can bet he isn't short on cash now. Each castmember earned a cool million bucks every time another episode of the hit TV show was shot. 
						Born in Williamstown, Massachusetts, on August 19, 1969, Matthew L Perry moved to the Canadian city of Ottawa with his mother before his first birthday and shortly after his parents divorced. Unlike many who go on to be famous actors, Matthew had no dream of treading the boards, but set his sights instead at the tennis court. Dedicating himself to the game, by the time he was a teenager, he had become the city's Number Two junior player.
Aged 15, Matthew moved to LA to be with his father John Bennett Perry, a successful actor who played the rugged sailor in Old Spice commercials. Tennis fell by the wayside after he realised he'd never be the next Jimmy Connors, and the youngster refocused his aspirations on his father's profession. "I thought, 'We've got a problem here. He's good. There's another generation shot to hell!'," Perry senior later told a reporter, remembering his son's first performance at school.
Graduating from high school with mediocre grades, Matthew was determined to become an actor, although he reassured his father that should he still be out of work in a year's time, he would go to college. But the future Chandler Bing lucked out, getting cast in several TV sitcoms. The luck, however, didn't last long enough for Matthew to become a household name, as three of the sitcoms were cancelled after 13 weeks.
Then came Friends. While helping a couple of friends prepare their auditions for the series, Matthew spotted an opportunity. "The part of Chandler leapt off the page, shook my hand, and said: 'This is you, man!'," he later told a journalist. His final audition took place on a Friday afternoon, and the following Monday he started work on the set.
Overnight, Matthew's life changed. The hottest TV show in the US, Friends enabled the actor to buy a house in the chic Hollywood Hills, play tennis with John McEnroe at celebrity charity events, and make the often tricky leap from small to big screen. As with some of his co-stars, the transition was not as smooth as the actor would have liked, however.
His first big screen lead was opposite Salma Hayek in the 1997 romantic comedy Fools Rush In, which also starred his father. It failed to set the box office on fire, however. Almost Heroes also bombed, but he later scored with The Whole Nine Yards. Matthew also worked on Servicing Sara opposite Liz Hurley, but filming was suspended when he checked into rehab in the first half of 2001 for treatment of an unspecified addiction. The film was eventually released to mixed reviews.
It was not the first time Matthew had run into trouble. In the mid-Nineties, the actor became addicted to the popular painkiller Vicodin, although he later successfully kicked the habit. Then last year, after rumours circulated that Matthew had an eating disorder after his weight yo-yoed, he admitted to suffering from pancreatitis, a painful illness that can be triggered by either alcohol abuse or prescription drugs. "In my case, it was hard living and drinking hard and eating poorly," he admitted to an American magazine.
Although his Friends character Chandler married Monica, Matthew Perry is still single. High-profile relationships with Julia Roberts and Yasmine Bleeth fizzled out and he is currently dating fashion student Rachel Dunn.

Birth Name: Matthew Langford PerryBirth Place: Williamstown, MADate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 08/19/1969, LeoProfession: Actor; producer; director
Born in the U.S. but raised in Canada, this handsome actor began appearing on TV as a teen and had already survived a number of short-lived series when he shot to stardom on the seminal sitcom Friends. During the show's 10-year run, Perry perfected his signature shtick—a combination of sarcasm and slapstick—and earned three Emmy nods for his work. He also launched a big-screen career, starring in a string of unfunny comedies (Serving Sara, Almost Heroes, Fools Rush In) and one amusing blockbuster, The Whole Nine Yards, which spawned a laughless sequel. Off screen, Perry was linked to a bevy of lovely ladies (Yasmine Bleeth, Julia Roberts) and publicly battled drug addiction and questions about his fluctuating frame. After Friends ended in 2004, he was back cracking wise as a cheeky late-night sketch-show writer in Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. But the series only lasted one season—bad luck that seems to be happening a lot for Perry and nearly all of his Friends costars, who have yet to find box-office or small-screen gold. Matthew Perry Fast Facts:

        A beach that in 1944 was being pulverised by shells and gunfire and strewn with the brave wounded and dying  heard the lament of a lone piper today as the world remembers those who made the ultimate sacrifice in Nazi-occupied France.

In 1843-1844, Perry commanded the African Squadron, which was engaged in suppressing the slave trade.
In 1853, Perry was sent on a mission by President Millard Fillmore to establish trade with Japan  a country that had been isolated from the outside world since the 17th century.
In July of that same year, Perry leads a squadron of four ships into Tokyo Bay and presented representatives of the Japanese Emperor with the text of a proposed commercial and friendship treaty. The Japanese rejected Perrys demands and Perry withdrew.
Perry returned to Japan in February, 1854. This time he appears with seven ships - four sailing ships, three steamers  and one thousand, six hundred men.
After a standoff, Perry landed for peace and trade talks on March 8, 1854, and began to negotiate with the Japanese to establish a trade agreement.
			On March 31, 1854, Perry signs the Treaty of Kanagawa on behalf of the United States, which established "permanent" friendship between the two countries. The treaty guaranteed that the Japanese would save shipwrecked Americans and provide fuel for American ships, but also opened the opportunity for trade between Japan and the United States. The signing of this treaty signaled the end of Japanese isolation.
