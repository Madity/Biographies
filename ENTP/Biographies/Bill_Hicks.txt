William Melvin "Bill" Hicks (December 16, 1961 – February 26, 1994) was an American stand-up comedian, social critic, satirist and musician. His material, encompassing a wide range of social issues including religion, politics, and philosophy, was controversial, and often steeped in dark comedy. He criticized consumerism, superficiality, mediocrity, and banality within the media and popular culture, which he characterized as oppressive tools of the ruling class that "keep people stupid and apathetic".[1]
At the age of 16, while still in high school, he began performing at the Comedy Workshop in Houston, Texas. During the 1980s, he toured the United States extensively and made a number of high-profile television appearances; but it was in the UK that he amassed a significant fan base, filling large venues during his 1991 tour.[2] He also achieved a modicum of recognition as a guitarist and songwriter.
Hicks died of pancreatic cancer on February 26, 1994 in Little Rock, Arkansas, at the age of 32. In subsequent years – in particular after a series of posthumous album releases – his body of work gained a significant measure of acclaim in creative circles, and he developed a substantial "cult" following. In 2007 he was voted the fourth greatest stand-up comic on Channel 4's list of the UK's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups, and he maintained that ranking on the 2010 list.[3]
Hicks was born in Valdosta, Georgia, the son of Jim and Mary (Reese) Hicks and younger sibling of Lynn and Steve. The family lived in Florida, Alabama, and New Jersey before settling in Houston, Texas, when Bill was seven.[4] He was drawn to comedy at an early age, emulating Woody Allen and Richard Pryor, and writing routines with his friend Dwight Slade. At school he began performing comedy – mostly derivations of Woody Allen material – for his classmates.[5] At home, he would write his own one-liners and slide them under the bedroom door of his brother Steve – the only family member Bill respected – for his critical analysis. "Keep it up", Steve told him. "You're really good at this."[6]
Early on, Hicks began to mock his family's Southern Baptist religious beliefs. "We were Yuppie Baptists," he joked to the Houston Post in 1987. "We worried about things like, 'If you scratch your neighbor's Subaru, should you leave a note?' "[7] Biographer Cynthia True described a typical argument with his father:
The elder Hicks would say, "I believe that the Bible is the literal word of God." And Bill would counter, "No it's not, Dad." "Well, I believe that it is." "Well," Bill replied, "you know, some people believe that they're Napoleon. That's fine. Beliefs are neat. Cherish them, but don't share them like they're the truth."[8]
Hicks did not, however, reject spiritual ideology itself, and throughout his life, he sought various alternative methods of experiencing it. Kevin Slade, elder brother of Dwight, introduced him to Transcendental Meditation and other forms of spirituality. Over one Thanksgiving weekend he took Hicks and Dwight to a TM retreat, the "Residence Course", in Galveston.[9] Worried about his rebellious behavior, his parents took him to a psychoanalyst at age 17. According to Hicks, after the first group session the analyst took him aside and told him, "You can continue coming if you want to, but it's them, not you."[4]
Hicks was associated with the Texas Outlaw Comics group developed at the Comedy Workshop in Houston in the 1980s.[10][11] Once Hicks gained some underground success in night clubs and universities, he quit drinking. However, Hicks continued to smoke cigarettes.
By January 1986, Hicks was using recreational drugs and his financial resources had dwindled.[12] His career received another upturn in 1987, however, when he appeared on Rodney Dangerfield's Young Comedians Special. The same year, he moved to New York City, and for the next five years performed about 300 times a year.[citation needed] On the album Relentless, he jokes that he quit using drugs because "once you've been taken aboard a UFO, it's kind of hard to top that", although in his performances, he continued to extol the virtues of LSD, marijuana, and psychedelic mushrooms.[13]
He eventually fell back to chain-smoking,[14] a theme that would figure heavily in his performances from then on. His nicotine addiction, love of smoking, and occasional attempts to quit became a recurring theme in his act throughout his later years.
In 1988, Hicks signed on with his first professional business manager, Jack Mondrus.[citation needed]
On the track "Modern Bummer" of his 1990 album Dangerous, Hicks says he quit drinking alcohol in 1988.
In 1989, he released his first video, Sane Man; a remastered version with 30 minutes of extra footage was released in 1999.[15]
In 1990, Hicks released his first album, Dangerous, performed on the HBO special One Night Stand, and performed at Montreal's Just for Laughs festival.[12] He was also part of a group of American stand-up comedians performing in London's West End in November. Hicks was a huge hit in the UK and Ireland and continued touring there throughout 1991.[16] That year, he returned to Just for Laughs and filmed his second video, Relentless.
Hicks made a brief detour into musical recording with the Marble Head Johnson album in 1992 collaborating with Houston high school friend Kevin Booth and Austin Texas drummer Pat Brown. During the same year he toured the UK, where he recorded the Revelations video[17] for Channel 4. He closed the show with his soon-to become-famous philosophy regarding life, "It's Just a Ride". Also in that tour he recorded the stand-up performance released in its entirety on a double CD titled Salvation. Hicks was voted "Hot Standup Comic" by Rolling Stone magazine in 1993. He moved to Los Angeles in 1992.[citation needed]
Progressive metal band Tool invited Hicks to open a number of concerts in its 1993 Lollapalooza appearances, where Hicks once asked the audience to look for a contact lens he had lost. Thousands of people complied.[18]
Members of Tool felt that they and Hicks "were resonating similar concepts".[19] Intending to raise awareness about Hicks's material and ideas, Tool dedicated their triple-platinum[20] album Ænima (1996) to Hicks. Both the lenticular casing of the Ænima album packaging as well as the chorus of the title track "Ænema" make reference to a sketch from Hicks's Arizona Bay album, in which he contemplates the idea of Los Angeles falling into the Pacific Ocean. Ænima's final track, "Third Eye" contains samples from Hicks's Dangerous and Relentless albums.[19][21]
An alternate version of the Ænima artwork shows a painting of Bill Hicks, calling him "Another Dead Hero," and mentions of Hicks are found both in the liner notes and on the record.
In 1984, Hicks was invited to appear on Late Night with David Letterman for the first time. He had a joke that he used frequently in comedy clubs about how he caused a serious accident that left a classmate using a wheelchair. NBC had a policy that no handicapped jokes could be aired on the show, making his stand-up routine difficult to perform without mentioning words such as "wheelchair".[22]
On October 1, 1993, Hicks was scheduled to appear on Late Show with David Letterman, where Letterman had recently moved to CBS. It was his 12th appearance on a Letterman late-night show, but his entire performance was removed from the broadcast; until that point the only occasion where a comedian's entire routine was cut after taping.[23] Hicks' stand-up routine was removed from the show, Hicks said, because Letterman's producers believed the material, which included jokes involving religion and the anti-abortion movement, was unsuitable for broadcast.[23] Producer Robert Morton initially blamed CBS, which denied responsibility; Morton later conceded it was his decision.[23] Although Letterman later expressed regret at the way Hicks had been handled, Hicks did not appear on the show again.[23][note 1]
Letterman finally aired the censored routine in its entirety on January 30, 2009. Hicks's mother, Mary, was present in the studio and appeared on-camera as a guest. Letterman took responsibility for the original decision to remove Hicks's set from the 1993 show. "It says more about me as a guy than it says about Bill," he said, after the set aired, "because there was absolutely nothing wrong with that."[24][25]
For many years, Hicks was friends with fellow comedian Denis Leary. But in 1993, Hicks was angered by Leary's album No Cure for Cancer, which featured lines and subject matter similar to Hicks's routine.[26] According to American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story by Cynthia True, upon hearing the album "Bill was furious. All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary's lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff, and even bought bits from one another. Milton Berle and Robin Williams were famous for it. This was different. Leary had practically taken line for line huge chunks of Bill's act and recorded it."[27] The friendship ended abruptly as a result.[28]
At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole Hicks's material as well as his persona and attitude.[29][30][31] In an interview, when Hicks was asked why he had quit smoking, he answered, "I just wanted to see if Denis would, too."[32] In another interview, Hicks said, "I have a scoop for you. I stole his [Leary's] act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and, to really throw people off, I did it before he did."[33] During a 2003 Comedy Central Roast of Denis Leary, comedian Lenny Clarke, a friend of Leary's, said there was a carton of cigarettes backstage from Bill Hicks with the message, "Wish I had gotten these to you sooner." This joke was cut from the final broadcast.[34]
Leary was in Montreal hosting the "Nasty Show" at Club Soda, and Colleen [McGarr?] was coordinating the talent so she stood backstage and overheard Leary doing material incredibly similar to old Hicks riffs, including his perennial Jim Fixx joke: "Keith Richards outlived Jim Fixx, the runner and health nut. The plot thickens." When Leary came offstage, Colleen, more stunned than angry, said, "Hey, you know that's Bill Hicks's material! Do you know that's his material?" Leary stood there, stared at her without saying a word, and briskly left the dressing room.[27]
Hicks's performance style was seen as a play on his audience's emotions. He expressed anger, disgust, and apathy while addressing the audience in a casual and personal manner, which he likened to merely conversing with his friends. He would invite his audiences to challenge authority and the existential nature of "accepted truth." One such message, which he often used in his shows, was delivered in the style of a news report (in order to draw attention to the negative slant news organizations give to any story about drugs):
Today, a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration—that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we're the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather.[35]
The American philosopher and ethnomycologist Terence McKenna was a frequent source of Hicks' most controversial psychedelic and philosophical counter-cultural material; he infamously acted out an abridged version of McKenna's "Stoned Ape" model of human evolution as a routine during several of his final shows.[36][37]
Another of Hicks's most famous quotes was delivered during a gig in Chicago in 1989 (later released as the bootleg I'm Sorry, Folks). After a heckler repeatedly shouted "Free Bird", Hicks screamed that "Hitler had the right idea; he was just an underachiever!" Hicks followed this remark with a misanthropic tirade calling for unbiased genocide against the whole of humanity.[38]
Much of Hicks's routine involved direct attacks on mainstream society, religion, politics, and consumerism. Asked in a BBC interview why he cannot do a routine that appeals "to everyone", he said that such an act was impossible. He responded by repeating a comment that an audience member once made to him, "We don't come to comedy to think!", to which he replied, "Gee, where do you go to think? I'll meet you there!" In the same interview, he also said: "My way is half-way between: this is a night-club, and these are adults."[39]
Hicks often discussed popular conspiracy theories in his performances, most notably the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He mocked the Warren Report and the official version of Lee Harvey Oswald as a "lone nut assassin." He also questioned the guilt of David Koresh and the Branch Davidian compound during the Waco Siege. Hicks would end some of his shows, especially those being recorded in front of larger audiences as albums, with a mock "assassination" of himself on stage, making gunshot sound effects into the microphone while falling to the ground.
On June 16, 1993, Hicks was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer that had spread to his liver.[40] He started receiving weekly chemotherapy, while still touring and also recording his album, Arizona Bay, with Kevin Booth. He was also working with comedian Fallon Woodland on a pilot episode of a new talk show, titled Counts of the Netherworld for Channel 4 at the time of his death. The budget and concept had been approved, and a pilot was filmed. The Counts of the Netherworld pilot was shown at the various Tenth Anniversary Tribute Night events around the world on February 26, 2004.
After being diagnosed with cancer, Hicks would often joke that any given performance would be his last. The public, however, was unaware of Hicks's condition. Only a few close friends and family members knew of his disease. Hicks performed the final show of his career at Caroline's in New York on January 6, 1994. He moved back to his parents' house in Little Rock, Arkansas, shortly thereafter. He called his friends to say goodbye before he stopped speaking on February 14.[41] He died of pancreatic cancer on February 26, 1994 in Little Rock at the age of 32.[42][43] Hicks was buried in the family plot in Magnolia Cemetery, Leakesville, Mississippi.[44]
On February 7, 1994, a verse Hicks had authored, on his perspective, wishes, and thanks of his life, to be released after his death as his "last word", ended with the words: "I left in love, in laughter, and in truth and wherever truth, love and laughter abide, I am there in spirit."[40]
Arizona Bay and Rant in E-Minor were released posthumously in 1997 on the Voices imprint of the Rykodisc label. Dangerous and Relentless were also re-released by Rykodisc on the same date.
In a 2005 poll to find The Comedian's Comedian, fellow comedians and comedy insiders voted Hicks No. 13 on their list of "The Top 20 Greatest Comedy Acts Ever".[45] Likewise, in "Comedy Central Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time" (2004),[46] Hicks was ranked at #19. In March 2007, Channel 4 ran a poll, "The Top 100 Stand-Up Comedians of All Time", in which Hicks was voted #6. Channel 4 renewed this list in April 2010, which saw Hicks move up 2 places to #4.[3]
Devotees of Hicks have incorporated his words, image, and attitude into their own creations. By means of audio sampling, fragments of Hicks's rants, diatribes, social criticisms, and philosophies have found their way into many musical works, such as the live version of Super Furry Animals' "Man Don't Give A Fuck". His influence on the band Tool is well-documented; he "appears" on the Fila Brazillia album Maim That Tune (1996) and on SPA's self-titled album SPA (1997), which are both dedicated to Hicks; the British band Radiohead's second album The Bends (1995) is also dedicated to his memory.[47] Singer/songwriter Tom Waits listed Rant in E-Minor as one of his 20 most cherished albums of all time.[48]
Comedians such as Joe Rogan,[49][50] Dave Attell,[51] Lewis Black,[52] Patton Oswalt[53] David Cross,[54] Russell Brand,[55] and Ron White have stated that they were inspired by Hicks.[56]
The British actor Chas Early portrayed Hicks in the one-man stage show Bill Hicks: Slight Return, which premiered in 2004. The show was co-written by Chas Early and Richard Hurst, and imagined Hicks's view of the world 10 years after his death.
On February 25, 2004, British MP Stephen Pound tabled an early day motion titled "Anniversary of the Death of Bill Hicks" (EDM 678 of the 2003–04 session), the text of which reads:
That this House notes with sadness the 10th anniversary of the death of Bill Hicks, on 26th February 1994, at the age of 33 [sic]; recalls his assertion that his words would be a bullet in the heart of consumerism, capitalism and the American Dream; and mourns the passing of one of the few people who may be mentioned as being worth [sic] of inclusion with Lenny Bruce in any list of unflinching and painfully honest political philosophers.[57]
Hicks appeared in a flashback scene in writer Garth Ennis's Vertigo comic-book series Preacher, in the story "Underworld" in issue No. 31 (Nov. 1997).[58][59]
A documentary entitled American: The Bill Hicks Story, based on interviews with his family and friends, premiered on March 12, 2010, at the South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas.[60]
Russell Crowe announced in 2012 that he will direct a Bill Hicks biopic.[61] Crowe was originally thought to be playing the comedian, but Mark Staufer, the actor's schoolmate and writer on the film, has suggested the part is now open for casting. Production was expected to start in 2013.[62]

 Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, Andy Kaufman -- add Bill Hicks to that list of brilliant, fearless comics. Just emerging from underground cult status when he died at age thirty-two, Bill Hicks spent most of his life making audiences roar -- and censors cringe -- with biting social satire about everything from former president George Bush to rock stars who hawk diet Coke. His nervy talent redefined the boundaries of comedy in the '80s and won him a list of admirers that includes John Cleese, George Carlin, and Thom Yorke of Radiohead.This posthumous biography reveals for the first time what made Bill Hicks tick -- what made him laugh, what pissed him off, and what he saw as his ultimate mission: to release people from their prison of ignorance. From his first comedy gig at Bible camp to his infamous cancellation on The Late Show with David Letterman, Cynthia True portrays an artist whose outrage, drive, and compassion fueled a controversial body of work that still resonates today.

       In 1993, not long after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, controversial comedian Hicks found his final, scathing appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman abruptly excised at network demand. Months later, at age 32, he was dead. Hicks's bitterly confrontational brand of comedy was not for everyone, but many were passionate about his work. Los Angeles-based journalist True here describes the evolution of Hicks's acerbic comedy standard, his many acquaintances inside and outside of the industry, his influences, and his tragic demise. True's accounts of the comedian's many adventures including his drug experimentation and booze binges, his explosive TV and concert appearances, and his volatile personal relationships are what make this book worthwhile, and Hicks's fans won't be disappointed. A number of rarely seen black-and-white photographs are scattered throughout the book, and Janeane Garofalo provides a foreword. A great addition to library collections that own Hicks's first two live-comedy CDs, Dangerous and Relentless. Recommended as a fascinating portrait of this unique individual and as the only existing biography of a trailblazing entertainer who left us far too soon. David M.

       *Starred Review*  Biographies rarely capture the uniqueness and vitality of a performer as deftly as this hilarious and touching chronicle of the short life of maverick comedian Bill Hicks. Rebelling from a rigid south Texas upbringing, Hicks focused his fury into a controversial career of ranting against all hypocrisy, from the Christian right's to that of hack entertainers, particularly shallow comedians, and the censorship of his act on David Letterman. True makes a strong case for Hicks as heir to Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor, putting hard truths in the guise of humor in a desperate attempt to educate and convert. Rather than seeming a martyr, however, Hicks comes across as a deeply, perhaps dangerously sensitive man blessed with extraordinary wit and a profound sense of justice, who tried night after night to work through his doubts, fears, and, of course, anger. The audience in many of the book's admirably constructed performance scenes seems to be simply along for the ride, with no idea of its ultimate destination, alternately laughing uproariously and sitting in bewildered silence. True shows great restraint in unfolding Hicks' story, often allowing his words to speak for themselves and demonstrating a vital sense of comic timing herself. After a moving account of Hicks' death from pancreatic cancer at 32, she concludes, "Four days later, Carrot Top won the American Comedy Award." Bill Hicks would have laughed.

  I fall into the "fanatical" camp when it comes to Bill Hicks.  He's still the greatest comedian I've ever heard and his material has made a lasting impact on me ever since I first heard his albums when I was 18.  Considering how Bill was so enthralled with the legacy left behind by Hendrix, The Stones etc I think it quite ironic that Bill, to me, is probably MORE 'rock and roll' than any one of them...But anyway, the fact remains that fans have pretty much been starved of ANY new Bill material for years, and despite his growing cult status there are still just the same albums and videos around on the market.So for other Hicks fans like myself, whether this biography is good or bad is largely irrelevant - we'll buy it regardless.  But for those who haven't yet invested in a copy I would make the following comments...Overall this book is a detailed and interesting account of Bill's life but it won't blow you away. It maps Bills life in quite good detail from an early age - some periods more interesting than others, and it certainly begins to pick up steam by the time it reaches 1990 (or, roughly, around the time Bill records "Dangerous") a period I think that should have taken up a greater chunk of the book.Unfortunately I found True's style of writing to be quite matter-of-fact, and the lack of emotional involvement does make the book rather dry and often unengaging.  I don't question True's credentials, but the feeling that were someone else given the same information who was perhaps as passionate about Bill as Bill was about, well....everything, then a better more vivid book would have been written.Ultimately, it's a worthy addition to a far too small canon....and I really miss the guy.
I never knew about Bill Hicks during his lifetime, and when I did finally stumble upon one of his albums a few years ago, it floored me that this genius had died of pancreatic cancer in 1994, and wouldn't produce any more material, while hack comics would put out barely-40 minute sets of their reworked material for years to come on Leno and HBO.  So I've spent the last few years trying to dig up every shard I could on Hicks, and I was glad when True's book came out.As far as a third-person biography, this isn't bad.  Cynthia True did manage to do some research with friends and family, and put together a decent timeline of Bill's life.  The detail on his childhood were especially interesting to someone who had only listed to the Hicks discography: stories of him doing standup at 14, hanging out with his friend Dwight and alternating between meditation workshops, planning their escape to LA, trying to get gigs as amateur comedians at talent shows in Houston, and putting together an infamous high-school band called Stress, which had a lot of mythology, but no real gigs.The book does a good job of covering the rise of Hicks' comedy career, from the rough times in LA to the national circuit as comedy clubs took off in the 80s, to Bill's alcoholism and almost self-destruction on the road.  It's strange to read about all of the ties he had to now-household names, from Seinfeld to Leno to Denis Leary (who ripped off a bunch of Hicks' jokes in his own act).It's a page-turning read to find out more about the rise of this workaholic, who was trying to get TV shows written and books outlined pretty much to the end.Read more ›
  A lot of the people trashing this book are die hard Hicks fans that feel the book isn't up to the same standard that Bill's comedy is, and they are completely correct.  The author isn't a great writer, by any means.  That doesn't mean the book isn't worth reading, though.  Even though the writing is mediocre at best, the material is top notch.  The biggest hack in the world could write about Hicks, and it would be worth reading, because he is that interesting.  And one compliment I can give this author, is she is obviously a fan.  She wrote this book lovingly, and it makes the ending of this book and his life that much sadder.  If you're a Hicks fan, it's a must read.  It's still very enjoyable.  I look forward to a better BIO one day, but I could definitely live with this one.
  I have been a Bill Hicks fan ever since my best friend turned me onto a few pieces of his routine. Since then, I've purchased every released CD and collected as much material as possible. I have to admit that I was a bit wary of my purchase of this book once I actually started looking at the reviews.I'm not sure what was wrong with some of the other reviewers... I found this book absolutely stunning. It is well written and very informative.There is but one point where I disagree with the author. She claims that identifying the life of Bill Hicks as a tragedy is missing the point. I started out thinking his life was a tragedy, read her book, and now I see it as an even bigger tragedy.Nevertheless, she's written a very good book, and I can't help but recommend it to anyone with respect for the man.
      I was curious about Bill Hick's story, after catching a special several years ago on HBO called "It's Just a Ride".
      This is a fascinating read and I could not put it down.  The author just dives in and gives us Mr. Hicks, warts and all.  I have passed it on to a friend to read.
      I bought this shortly after discovering Bill Hicks. He has quickly become my favourite comedian. This book is a pretty easy and quick read. All in all a very enjoyable purchase.
      I would give the book three and a half stars if I could. I know a lot of people have complained that the author didn't know Bill Hicks personally.
      Having loved Bill Hicks for some time I decided to read this book and was not disappointed. There is a depth to Bill's life that you see from the topics of his comedy but that gets...
      The story of Bill Hicks, like his idols JFK and Martin Luther King, is familiar to most people who've heard of him - a brilliant talent, on the verge of success, cut tragically...
      Informative facts provided by Dwight Slade (childhood friend).  I had a problem with the foreword...Janeane Garofalo?
      You really get the feeling this started with the phrase "Honey, who can I write about for school? My teacher said I can't do Jewel again.
      Though really, you should just go ahead and start with Bill's body of brutal, powerhouse work, this still stands as a good supplement to that material.Ms.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Born in Georgia but raised in Houston since the age of 7, this self-described "Prince of Darkness" was compelled to use the comedy stage as his philosophic soapbox. At 13, he would sneak out of his suburban house to hustle his way onto open-mike night rosters. In two brief decades, Hicks worked his way up the sweat-stained comedy ladder to national exposure on The Tonight Show, Late Show with David Letterman and an HBO cable special. Rolling Stone named him the "hot stand-up" of 1993. He was the hit of the 1990 and 1991 Just for Laughs comedy festivals in Montreal. Dead at 32, the enigmatic Hicks was admired, reviled and misunderstood. - The Montreal Gazette, March 28, 1994
          Bill Hicks was regarded as one of the greatest comedians who ever lived by those who saw him. Unfortunately, in his home country of America he was very controversial - as many great comedians often are. His status in the US was that of a cult icon. He also had a strong following in the UK and was scheduled to have his own television show on British TV when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Comparisons were made with Sam Kinison and Lenny Bruce during his life, but neither is really true. He had more brains than Kinison and was funnier than Bruce. One of the greatest comedians who ever lived.
      Among Hicks's biggest fans were the members of the band Tool. Tool's 1996 album "Aenema" includes many Hicks references, including a picture in the liner notes, a sound clip of a Hicks routine before the final track "Third Eye", and references to Hicks's "Arizona Bay" routine in the title track.
      He appeared 11 times on David Letterman, but always in a very "neutered" way. His final appearance (which he had hoped would be his final message to America before he died, his cancer diagnosis was known only to friends and family) was recorded but cut out of the final broadcast at the last minute. Ironically, afterwards he was called back and asked to do another performance; his response was: "I don't think I could learn to juggle in that short a time." Bill strongly criticized the show for its "ludicrous" censorship policies (not being able to say the word "Jesus" being one of them). David Letterman later appeared in a documentary about Bill (the UK produced "Totally Bill Hicks") in which he expressed his regret about how the situation had ended. The only known video footage was a VHS tape given to Hicks's parents which remained unseen until January 31, 2009, when Letterman had Mary Hicks, Bill's mother, as a guest to introduce it. Prior to airing the footage, Letterman took full responsibility for its being edited out, apologized and said "It says more about me as a guy than it says about Bill because there was absolutely nothing wrong with it".
      To make ends meet, Bill would drive the son of the owners of the night club he was working at in California to school after working all night. The club was the Comedy Store owned by Sammy and Mitzi Shore. Their son was Pauly Shore.
      Though he generally disliked television, he was a huge fan of "The Simpsons," once remarking to a friend that he would like to live in Springfield, and Krusty The Klown's persona as a counter-cultural stand-up comedian in the ninth season episode "Last Temptation of Krust" is a tribute to him.
      Born in Georgia, he grew up in Florida, Alabama,and New Jersey before settling in Houston, Texas.
      Was raised a Southern Baptist. He rejected his families beliefs at a young age and adopted his own philosophy. He often joked about The Bible Belt in his acts.
      Lived in New York City. Moved to his parents house in Little Rock, Arkansas, weeks before his death.
      Less than a week after his burial he lost the American Comedy Award for Favorite Male Comedian to Carrot Top, whom he ridiculed during his final performances.
      His infamous banned David Letterman set was aired after remaining unseen for more than 15 years on January 30, 2009. Letterman had his mother on to introduce it and afterward said "it says more about me as a guy than it says about Bill because there was absolutely nothing wrong with it".
      At his final show: "This is the material, by the way, that has kept me virtually anonymous in America for the past 15 years. Gee, I wonder why we're hated the world over? Look at these fat Americans in the front row - 'Why doesn't he just hit fruit with a hammer?' Folks, I could have done that, walked around being a millionaire and franchising myself but no, I had to have this weird thing about trying to illuminate the collective unconscious and help humanity. Fucking moron."
      I ascribe to Mark Twain's theory that the last person who should be President is the one who wants it the most. The one who should be picked is the one who should be dragged kicking and screaming into the White House.
      On the theft of his material by Denis Leary: "I have a scoop for you. I stole his act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and to really throw people off, I did it before he did."
      It's great to be here. I thank you. Ah, I've been on the road doing comedy for ten years now, so bear with me while I plaster on a fake smile and plough through this shit one more time.
      I'm tired of this back-slapping "Isn't humanity neat?" bullshit. We're a virus with shoes, okay? That's all we are.
      I'm sorry if any of you are catholic. I'm not sorry if you're offended, I'm actually just sorry by the fact that you're catholic.
      I love going to the movies. So I'm watching Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and I'm thinking 'you know what? There is no way that you will ever be able to top these special effects in a movie again, you cannot top this shit.' Unless we started using terminally ill stunt people in the motion picture industry.
      [asked where a comedian should draw the line] There are no lines. There are no lines. I say, erase all the lines.

Bill Hicks is considered by many to be the best comedian of the modern era – ironic given his anonymity in his native America. He was described by many names – philosopher, social satirist, even preacher, but he was ultimately a comic who believed that he could save his audience by confronting them with the truth.
His short career was a rollercoaster – from sneaking out aged 15 to start performing against the wishes of his parents, through early experiments with drink and drugs to expand his consciousness, falling in with the Texas Outlaw Comics who helped him nurture and grow his comedy, but also helped him grow a massive alcohol and drug problem, which on several occasions looked like it might end his life.
Finally succeeding in his long battle to get clean opened up new audiences for him in Canada, and then to the UK, where things exploded with sell-out tours, mesmerising audiences as he skewered organised religion, the US media and his government’s hypocrisies.
Though considered ‘criminally unpatriotic’ at home, it looked like he was finally about to achieve wider recognition when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. His last chance at getting his message out to the American people was taken from him when his 12th and final performance on the Letterman show was famously censored in its entirety, his material considered too ‘dangerous’ for mainstream audiences. He died 4 months later. Bill was 32 years old.
15 years after his death, Bill Hicks’ popularity continues to grow. Regularly appearing on best of lists, and with tributes held yearly around the world, his CD sales increase each year as more and more people discover the words of the outlaw comic who tried to save the world. He still might…

Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, Andy Kaufman -- add Bill Hicks to that list of brilliant, fearless comics. Just emerging from underground cult status when he died at age thirty-two, Bill Hicks spent most of his life making audiences roar -- and censors cringe -- with biting social satire about everything from former president George Bush to rock stars who hawk diet Coke. His nervy talent redefined the boundaries of comedy in the '80s and won him a list of admirers that includes John Cleese, George Carlin, and Thom Yorke of Radiohead.This posthumous biography reveals for the first time what made Bill Hicks tick -- what made him laugh, what pissed him off, and what he saw as his ultimate mission: to release people from their prison of ignorance. From his first comedy gig at Bible camp to his infamous cancellation on The Late Show with David Letterman, Cynthia True portrays an artist whose outrage, drive, and compassion fueled a controversial body of work that still resonates today.(less)

If you're a fan of Bill Hicks, sit your ass down and read this book tonight. You know how it ends and it will break your heart, but it's a nice tribute to the Good Man. The jokes don't translate that well, and it's maybe not the best writing ever but you'll get a warts-and-all window of Hicks and you'll love him even more. If you're not a fan, read it anyway. 
I really cherish Bill Hicks, so when I read this book, I was a little disappointed with the content. Maybe I expected a bit more detail about his early years as a teenage comic or even during his Outlaw Comic days, but I was left wanting more knowledge all around to fill in some details about where his humor originated. I also wasn't impressed with the writting style.I would consider this a fine beginner's book for anyone curious about Bill Hicks who has maybe seen one special (see Revelations i...more

Otherwise, there is a lot from his albums and video specials as well as articles that can enlighten those who are already vaguely familiar with his background.(less)
It's like some other reviewers say, this book is a good introduction to the man.  It's appropriate that for a book about a promising and blazing life cut short, it does occasionally feel as if there could have been more to it, and that we're missing something.
I've been playing around with stand-up comedy for a VERY short period of time, and one of the first things I ran into is this -- if I did a bit on religion or politics or advertising, I'd be told, "Bill Hicks did something similar, cut it."And, yes, Bill Hicks has done just about everything.

I've been playing around with stand-up comedy for a VERY short period of time, and one of the first things I ran into is this -- if I did a bit on religion or politics or advertising, I'd be told, "Bill Hicks did something similar, cut it."And, yes, Bill Hicks has done just about everything. If you want to learn about the origins of political satire here in America, it all goes back, almost in a straight line, to Bill Hicks (and then to Lenny Bruce). This book traces Hicks from his childhood through the straight-edge days of his early comedy, through the psilocybin days, all the way through the last days of him alive, with cancer. It's an amazingly detailed book, very moving, and -- as with the life of any great stand-up comic -- it has a great punchline.I highly recommend going through all of hick's audio and video pieces as well, but this book will give you a sense of the overall story and where Hicks developed his material from. For a comedian, or anyone interested in American political satire (especially on the RAUNCHY side -- Hicks NEVER stops cursing or pushing taboo boundaries) -- this is a must.(less)
I can't believe that it took until 2002 until someone wrote about Bill Hicks as it was acknowledged since the time of his death what a major influence he had on comedy. If I was competent enough I would have but luckily for you and probably me, Cynthia True came along and blew everyone away with her extremely emotional biography about the great man. This made me feel like I was watching Man on the Moon, watching my first born take its first few steps, it moved more more than I would ever imagine...more

This made me feel like I was watching Man on the Moon, watching my first born take its first few steps, it moved more more than I would ever imagine and more. Just reading and re-visiting and appreciating Hicks in this present day and culture and necessity of war that we live in today, makes you think that he was definitely onto something even though the Bush he talks about is W.s father. So ahead of his time and unappreciated in the thick set and scared comedy world still burgeoning from American TV, Hicks established early on a caustic repertoire and always loving and loyal cult following who knew he was right."Do you think that when Jesus comes back he's really gonna wanna look t a cross...?"Genius wasted to the man upstairs that makes you wonder whether he had to repent.(less)

A book about a comedian who lived fast, died young.  Written by someone who never met him.So I'm a huge Bill Hicks fan.

The alcohol abuse is pretty well documented, but the recovery is glossed over, as is his on-again-off-again relationship with cigarettes and narcotics.Since I came to the book with fairly low expectations I can honestly say they were met, and more.I approached Kevin Booth's Hicks biography, "Agent of Evolution" with much higher expectations; but save for a few chapters, I was largely disappointed, and Booth's sections, in particular, made him sound so selfish that it was difficult to feel any sympathy for him.Read them both, they are both excellent in parts, but neither one is everything it ought to be.(less)

A must-read for his fans though many times it felt like a glorified outline of a biography of Bill Hicks.  It focused much more on the stand-up comedy aspects of his life instead of delving, say, further into his childhood, although that terrain was sufficiently glossed over so that you understood how and why Bill came to be.  I loved the minutiae, the bitty details about him.  Wish there was a more comprehensive biography of him that had more of that, but that said, this one is solid.  Just heartbr...more

I loved this biography of Bill Hicks, arguably one of the best stand-ups in history.  I loved him while he was alive and was really sad when he left this earth, far too soon as is often the case with genius artistic types. I read this a long time ago but I remember it being well-done in my opinion.  I knew some of the stories already (I was friends with a few people who worked at Cobb's and Holy City Zoo) but it was a compelling read nonetheless.One of the last bits is really touching about a tree...more

Bill Hicks is one of my favorite comedians, and this book is an excellent telling of his history, his influences, and his sad death from pancreatic cancer when he was just about to make it big.  There is also a good discussion of the infamous incident where Hicks' routine was cut from the "The Late Show with David Letterman" because Letterman and the producer felt it was too edgy.

I'm only giving this a four because it's about one of my favorite comedians of all-time.  Overall, it's kind of a dull read probably because the author couldn't get the type of access that was necessary for such a book.  It probably would've helped if the subject would have lived beyond the age of 32, as such, it feels as incomplete as Hicks' career and work.  The end is depressing but he died with a lot of respect.
This is a must read for fans of Bill Hicks like I am. Its very good and my only complaint is that it is very matter of fact and doesnt go into too much depth. His life story is laid out well but not much insight to his comedy and how or why he became a great comedian. No long interviews with anyone who knew him well but its still a good read.
Bill Hicks is hard to capture on the page.  But, I came away with a better understanding of his brilliance and his frustrations after reading "American Scream".  There hasn't been a voice in comedy like him since.  "American Scream", if nothing else, makes you appreciate that fact.
It's truly--pun intended--a shame that the book about the greatest comedian ever was written by a terrible magazine writer who looks like she wasn't alive before Bill was dead. Of course, having Moon Zappa listed among one's feedback readers is no recommendation...
Great research about the short life of comedian Bill Hicks, but the writing style was terrible. I don't like starchy, academic biographies, but this one could have used a dose of that.Time to go to YouTube and watch some of Hicks' routines.
While the subject matter of this book makes for a great read, the writing seems to be down unenthusiastically and reads very much like a research paper. I love Bill Hicks and hope that I come across another biography that is better written. 
A good solid introduction to Bill Hicks, but you just cannot beat the real deal in action through source material.I enjoyed the book but nowhere near as much as "Love all the People" and subsequently watching and re-watching his recorded shows.
This was an interesting book about an interesting person.  It was full of stories about Bill Hicks's life as a comedian, but I wish it went into more depth about why he said and did the things he did.  It's worth reading, though.  
I love this guy... I mean, as much as one man can love another man that provoked uproariously laughter and revealed lesser known truths about existence in a profound and humorous manner, and that he never actually met... 
Interesting (for the most part) biography of Bill Hicks. It left me feeling really depressed. Also, it carries the torch for the installment of Hicks as the Jesus Christ of stand-up comedy. 
Bill Hicks should never be forgotten. His words still ring true today. A rebel, he serves as an inspirational soul to many who have had the pleasure of hearing his commentary. Not for the faint of heart!
Pretty straightforward bio.  Not v exciting.  Loking forward to the one written by his friend, Kevin Booth, which is supposed to be much livlier, as you'd expect.
I enjoyed this book when I read it as it was interesting to hear about Bill Hicks life but having subsequently read the one by Kevin Booth, this one pales in comparison.
Huge disappointment. Bill Hicks tops every comedian's list as one of the best ever but this book is so poorly written that it made an interesting man seem so mundane.  
As a huge Bill Hicks fan I'm obviously biased, but this was a good book about a great story.  Anyone who knows/likes Hicks would really like this book.
It's actually not written very well (I didn't think anyway), but Bill Hicks is a GENIUS and any fan of his should read it just because. Also one of my heroes.
Anyone a fan or not a fan of the great Bill Hicks must read this book to see how one man evolved ideas to change the world.

Bill Hicks will forever be remembered as the original alternative comedian. His style was groundbreaking, his approach was satirical and topical and his muse - cigarettes.
Hicks was born in Georgia in 1961 and his childhood was on of constant change. Moving from state to state before his family settled in Houston, Texas, Hicks found his calling in comedy and along with close friend, Dwight Slade, the two started to write scripts, emulating their hero - Woody Allen.
In the late 1970s and throughout the 80s Hicks worked his way around the US comedy circuit and at the age of just 17 he was a star at the Comedy Workshop in his hometown when he was still a student.
In the mid 80s, Hicks became a regular face on television on shows such as Tonight, With David Letterman as arranged by his friend Jay Leno. This is where he hit the big time.
Hicks suffered from drug and alcohol addictions and found his reputation suffered because of this. In 1987 he moved to New York and quit both drugs and alcohol in 1988. His time in New York saw him performing 300 times a year and his set began to be hinged upon his only vice - smoking. This new found success saw him release his first live video, Sane Man, to critical acclaim.
1990 saw Hicks release his first album, Dangerous, perform for an HBO special, One Night Stand, and appeared at the Just For Laughs festival in Montreal. His career brought him to London where he performed as part of a group of American stand-up comedians in the West End. His second album, Relentless, was released in 1991.
Hicks was invited to open a number of concerts for rock band Tool for the 1992 tour. Hicks famously asked the audience to look for a contact lens he'd lost - thousands of people complied to the amusement of the band and Hicks himself.
When touring Australia in 1993, Hicks was diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer after having pains in his side. He started to receive chemotherapy while touring with Kevin Booth and recording his Arizona Bay album. He was also working with Fallon Woodland on a pilot episode of a talk show for Channel 4 called Counts of the Netherworld.
In October 93, Hicks was due to appear on David Letterman's Late Show for the twelfth time but his performance was cancelled for various reasons that only became truly evident after his death.
He played his final show in New York on January 6, 1994 and moved back to his parents house in Little Rock soon after. After saying goodbye to his friends and family, Hicks stopped talking on the 14th February and at 11:20pm on the 26 February he died.
Hicks is a legend of the comedy scene and has more fans than ever before. His material is still relevant and just gets better and better with age.
