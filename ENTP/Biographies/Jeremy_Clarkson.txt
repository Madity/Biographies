=======================================================
Jeremy Charles Robert Clarkson (born 11 April 1960) is an English broadcaster, journalist and writer who specialises in motoring. He is best known for his role on the BBC TV show Top Gear along with co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May. He also writes weekly columns for The Sunday Times and The Sun.
From a career as a local journalist in Northern England, Clarkson rose to public prominence as a presenter of the original format of Top Gear in 1988. Since the mid-1990s, Clarkson has become a recognised public personality, regularly appearing on British television presenting his own shows and appearing as a guest on other shows. As well as motoring, Clarkson has produced programmes and books on subjects such as history and engineering. From 1998 to 2000, he also hosted his own chat show, Clarkson.
His opinionated but humorous tongue-in-cheek writing and presenting style has often provoked public reaction. His actions both privately and as a Top Gear presenter have also sometimes resulted in criticism from the media, politicians, pressure groups and the public. He has also generated a significant following from the public, being credited as a major factor in the resurgence of Top Gear as one of the most popular shows on the BBC.
Clarkson was born in Doncaster to travelling salesman Edward Grenville Clarkson and teacher Shirley Gabrielle Ward.[3] His parents, who ran a business selling tea cosies, put their son's name down in advance for private school with no idea how they were going to pay the fees, until at the last moment, when he was 13, they made two Paddington Bear stuffed toys for each of their children.[4] These proved so popular that they started selling them through the business with sufficient success to be able to pay the fees for Clarkson to attend Hill House School, Doncaster and later Repton School.[5][6] By his own account, he was expelled from Repton School for "drinking, smoking and generally making a nuisance of himself."[7] Clarkson attended Repton School alongside Formula One engineer Adrian Newey.[8]
Clarkson played the role of a public schoolboy, Taplin, in a BBC radio Children's Hour serial adaptation of Anthony Buckeridge's Jennings novels until his voice broke.[9]
Clarkson married Alexandra James (now Hall) in 1989, but she left him for one of his friends after six months.[10]
In May 1993 he married his manager,[3] Frances Cain (daughter of VC recipient Robert Henry Cain) in Fulham. The couple currently live in Chipping Norton, in the Cotswolds, with their three children.[11] Clarkson is a member of the Chipping Norton set.[12] Known for buying him car-related gifts, for Christmas 2007 Clarkson's second wife bought him a Mercedes-Benz 600.[13] She was reported to have filed divorce proceedings in April 2014. Clarkson is believed to be in a relationship with Phillipa Sage, who worked on Top Gear.[10]
In September 2010 Clarkson was granted a privacy injunction against his first wife to prevent her from publishing claims that their sexual relationship continued after his second marriage. (See AMM v HXW) He voluntarily lifted the injunction in October 2011,[14] commenting that: "Injunctions don’t work. You take out an injunction against somebody or some organisation and immediately news of that injunction and the people involved and the story behind the injunction is in a legal-free world on Twitter and the Internet. It’s pointless."[15]
Clarkson's fondness for wearing jeans has been blamed by some for the decline in sales of denim in the mid-1990s, particularly Levi's, because of their being associated with middle aged men, the so-called 'Jeremy Clarkson effect'.[16] After Trinny and Susannah labelled Clarkson's dress sense as that of a market trader, he was persuaded to appear on their fashion makeover show What Not to Wear in order to avoid being considered for their all-time worst dressed winner award.[17] Their attempts at restyling Clarkson were rebuffed, and Clarkson stated he would rather eat his own hair than appear on the show again.[18][19]
For an episode of the first series of the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are? broadcast in November 2004, Clarkson was invited to investigate his family history. It included the story of his great-great-great grandfather John Kilner (1792–1857), who invented the Kilner jar: a container for preserved fruit.[11][20]
Clarkson is a fan of the rock band Genesis and attended the band's reunion concert at Twickenham Stadium in 2007. He also provided sleeve notes for the reissue of the album Selling England by the Pound as part of the Genesis 1970–1975 box set.[21] He uses his love for Genesis to mock his fellow presenter of BBC Top Gear, Richard Hammond.
Clarkson was involved in a protracted legal dispute about access to a "permissive path" across the grounds of his second home on the Isle of Man from 2005 to 2010, after reports that dogs had attacked and killed sheep on the property.[22] Clarkson and his wife had claimed that four sheep were deliberately killed after being chased into the sea by a dog let off its lead.[23] He lost the dispute after the Isle of Man government held a public inquiry, and was told to re-open the footpath.[24] The decision was affirmed by the Isle of Man High Court.[25]
Clarkson's first job was as a travelling salesman for his parents' business selling Paddington Bear toys.[26] He later trained as a journalist with the Rotherham Advertiser, before also writing for the Rochdale Observer, Wolverhampton Express and Star, Lincolnshire Life and the Associated Kent Newspapers.
In 1984, Clarkson formed the Motoring Press Agency (MPA), in which, with fellow motoring journalist Jonathan Gill, he conducted road tests for local newspapers and automotive magazines. This developed into pieces for publications such as Performance Car.[27] He has regularly written for Top Gear magazine since its launch in 1993.
Clarkson writes regular columns in the tabloid newspaper The Sun, and for the broadsheet newspaper The Sunday Times. The Times columns are republished in The Weekend Australian newspaper. He also writes for the "Wheels" section of the Toronto Star.
Clarkson has written humorous books about cars and several other subjects. Many of his books are collections of articles that he has written for The Sunday Times.
Clarkson's first major television role came as one of the presenters on the British motoring programme Top Gear, from 27 October 1988 to 3 February 2000,[28] in the programme's earlier format, and then again from 20 October 2002, when it was relaunched in a new format after a brief period off the air. Along with co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond, he is credited with turning Top Gear into the most-watched TV show on BBC Two,[29] rebroadcast to over 100 countries around the world.[30]
Clarkson presented the first series UK version of Robot Wars.[31] His talk show, Clarkson, comprised 27 half-hour episodes aired in the United Kingdom between November 1998 and December 2000, and featured guest interviews with musicians, politicians and television personalities. Clarkson went on to present documentaries focused on non-motoring themes such as history and engineering, although the motoring shows and videos continued. Alongside his stand-alone shows, many mirror the format of his newspaper columns and books, combining his love of driving and motoring journalism, with the examination and expression of his other views on the world, such as in Jeremy Clarkson's Motorworld, Jeremy Clarkson's Car Years and Jeremy Clarkson Meets the Neighbours.
Clarkson's views are often showcased on television shows. In 1997, Clarkson appeared on the light-hearted comedy show Room 101, in which a guest nominates things they hate in life to be consigned to nothingness. Clarkson dispatched caravans, houseflies, the sitcom Last of the Summer Wine, the mentality within golf clubs, and vegetarians. He has made several appearances on the prime time talk shows Parkinson and Friday Night with Jonathan Ross since 2002. By 2003, his persona was deemed to fit the mould for the series Grumpy Old Men, in which middle-aged men talk about any aspects of modern life which irritate them. Since the topical news panel show Have I Got News for You dismissed regular host Angus Deayton in October 2002, Clarkson has become one of the most regularly used guest hosts on the show. Clarkson has appeared as a panellist on the political current affairs television show Question Time twice since 2000.
In 2007, Clarkson won the National Television Awards Special Recognition Award. Also in 2007, it was reported that Clarkson earned £1 million a year for his role as a Top Gear presenter, and a further £1.7 million from books, DVDs and newspaper columns.[32]
In 2007, Clarkson and co-presenter James May were the first people to reach the North Magnetic Pole in a car, chronicled in Top Gear: Polar Special.[33] In 2008, Clarkson sustained minor injuries to his legs, back and hand in an intentional collision with a brick wall while making the 12th series of Top Gear.[34]
Clarkson is in favour of personal freedom and against government regulation, stating that government should "build park benches and that is it. They should leave us alone."[35] He has a particular contempt for the Health and Safety Executive. He often criticised the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, especially what he calls the 'ban' culture, frequently fixating on the bans on smoking and 2004 ban on fox hunting.
Jeremy Clarkson's comments have both a large number of supporters and opposers. He often comments on the media-perceived social issues of the day such as the fear of challenging adolescent youths, known as 'hoodies'. In 2007 Clarkson was cleared of allegations of assaulting a hoodie while visiting central Milton Keynes, after Thames Valley Police said that if anything, he had been the victim.[36] In the five-part series Jeremy Clarkson: Meets the Neighbours he travelled around Europe in a Jaguar E-Type, examining (and in some cases reinforcing) his stereotypes of other countries.
As a motoring journalist, he is frequently critical of government initiatives such as the London congestion charge or proposals on road charging. He is also frequently scornful of caravanners and cyclists. He has often singled out John Prescott the former Transport Minister, and Stephen Joseph[37] the head of the public transport pressure group Transport 2000 for ridicule.
In September 2013 a tweet proposing that he might stand for election as an independent candidate in Doncaster North, the constituency of the current Labour leader of the opposition, Ed Miliband, excited much interest in the press.[38]
Clarkson is unsympathetic to the green movement and has little respect for groups such as Greenpeace—he believes that the "eco-mentalists" are a by-product of the "old trade unionists and CND lesbians" who had found a more relevant cause—[39] but "loves the destination" of environmentalism and believes that people should quietly strive to be more eco-friendly.[40] Regarding windfarms, he says that in the future, they will be described as "a reminder of the time when mankind temporarily took leave of its senses and decided wind, waves and lashings of tofu could somehow generate enough electricity for the whole planet"[41] Clarkson has voiced some views regarding global warming: he believes that higher temperatures are not necessarily negative and that anthropogenic carbon dioxide production has a negligible effect on the global climate,[40] but is aware of the negative potential consequences of global warming, saying "let's just stop and think for a moment what the consequences might be. Switzerland loses its skiing resorts? The beach in Miami is washed away? North Carolina gets knocked over by a hurricane? Anything bothering you yet?"[42]
In an attempt to prove the press and public furore over the 2007 UK child benefit data scandal was a fuss about nothing, he published his own bank account number and sort code, together with instructions on how to find out his address, in The Sun newspaper, expecting nobody to be able to remove money from his account. He later discovered that someone had set up a monthly direct debit for £500 to Diabetes UK.[43]
(See Top Gear controversies) Clarkson has been very critical of the Special Relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom.[44] He referred to USA as the United States of Total Paranoia, commenting that one needs a permit to do everything except for purchasing weapons.[45]
Whilst Clarkson states such views in his columns and in public appearances, his public persona does not necessarily represent his personal views, as he acknowledged whilst interviewing Alastair Campbell saying "I don't believe what I write, any more than you (Alastair Campbell) believe what you say".[46]
Clarkson has been described as a "skilful propagandist for the motoring lobby" by The Economist.[47] With a forthright and sometimes deadpan delivery, Clarkson is said to thrive on the notoriety his public comments bring, and has risen to the level of the bête noire of the various groups who disagree with his views. On the Channel 4 organised viewer poll, for the 100 Worst Britons We Love to Hate programme, Clarkson polled in 66th place. By 2005, Clarkson was perceived by the press to have upset so many people and groups, The Independent put him on trial for various 'crimes', declaring him guilty on most counts.[42]
Responses to Clarkson's comments are often directed personally, with derogatory comments about residents of Norfolk leading to some residents organising a "We hate Jeremy Clarkson" club. In The Guardian's 2007 'Media 100' list, which lists the top 100 most "powerful people in the [media] industry", based on cultural, economic and political influence in the UK, Clarkson was listed as a new entrant at 74th. Some critics even attribute Clarkson's actions and views as being influential enough to be responsible for the closure of Rover and the Luton manufacturing plant of Vauxhall.[48] Clarkson's comments about Rover prompted workers to hang an "Anti-Clarkson Campaign" banner outside the defunct Longbridge plant in its last days.
The BBC often plays down his comments as ultimately not having the weight they are ascribed. In 2007 they described Clarkson as "Not a man given to considered opinion",[20] and in response to an official complaint another BBC spokeswoman once said: "Jeremy's colourful comments are always entertaining, but they are his own comments and not those of the BBC. More often than not they are said with a twinkle in his eye."[49]
On his chat show, Clarkson, he caused upset to the Welsh by placing a 3D plastic map of Wales into a microwave oven and switching it on. He later defended this by saying, "I put Wales in there because Scotland wouldn't fit."[50][51][52]
In 2005, Clarkson received an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from the Oxford Brookes University.[53] His views on the environment precipitated a small demonstration at the award ceremony for his honorary degree, when Clarkson was pied by road protester Rebecca Lush.[54] Clarkson took this incident in good humour, responding 'good shot' and subsequently referring to Lush as "Banana girl".[55][56] Clarkson has spoken in support of hydrogen cars.[35]
In 2008, an internet petition was posted on the Prime Minister's Number 10 website to "Make Jeremy Clarkson Prime Minister". By the time it closed, it had attracted 49,446 signatures. An opposing petition posted on the same site set to "Never, Ever Make Jeremy Clarkson Prime Minister" attracted 87 signatures. Clarkson later commented he would be a rubbish Prime Minister as he is always contradicting himself in his columns.[35] In their official response to the petition, Number 10 agreed with Clarkson's comments.[57]
In response to the reactions he gets, Clarkson has stated "I enjoy this back and forth, it makes the world go round but it is just opinion."[35] On the opinion that his views are influential enough to topple car companies, he has argued that he has proof that he has had no influence. "When I said that the Ford Orion was the worst car ever it went on to become a best-selling car."[35]
Clarkson was ranked 49th on Motor Trend Magazine's Power List for 2011, its list of the fifty most influential figures in the automotive industry.[58]
Clarkson has a keen interest in the British Armed Forces and several of his DVDs and television shows have featured a military theme, whether it be flying in military jets or several Clarkson focused Top Gear spots having a military theme such as Clarkson escaping a Challenger 2 tank in a Range Rover, a Lotus Exige evading missile lock from an Apache attack helicopter, a platoon of Irish Guardsmen shooting at a Porsche Boxster and Mercedes-Benz SLK, or using a Ford Fiesta as a Royal Marine landing craft. Clarkson visited British troops in Baghdad in October 2005.[59]
Clarkson presented a programme looking at recipients of the Victoria Cross, in particular focusing on his father-in-law, Robert Henry Cain, who received a VC for actions during the Battle of Arnhem in World War II.[60]
In 2007, Clarkson wrote and presented Jeremy Clarkson: Greatest Raid of All Time, a documentary about the World War II Operation Chariot, a 1942 Commando raid on the docks of Saint-Nazaire in occupied France. At the end of 2007 Clarkson became a patron of Help for Heroes,[61] a charity aiming to raise money to provide better facilities to wounded British servicemen. His effort led to the 2007 Christmas appeal in The Sunday Times supporting Help for Heroes.[62] Clarkson is currently in the process of making a documentary about the Arctic convoys of World War II.
Clarkson is passionate about engineering, especially pioneering work. In Inventions That Changed the World Clarkson showcased the invention of the gun, computer, jet engine, telephone and television. He has previously criticised the engineering feats of the 20th century as merely improvements on the truly innovative inventions of the Industrial Revolution. He cites the lack of any source of alternative power for cars, other than by "small explosions". In Great Britons, as part of a public poll to find the greatest historical Briton, Clarkson was the chief supporter for Isambard Kingdom Brunel, a prominent engineer during the Industrial Revolution credited with numerous innovations. Despite this, he also has a passion for many modern examples of engineering. In Speed and Extreme Machines Clarkson rides and showcases numerous vehicles and machinery. Clarkson was awarded an honorary degree from Brunel University on 12 September 2003, partly because of his work in popularising engineering, and partly because of his advocacy of Brunel.[63]
In his book, I Know You Got Soul he describes many machines that he believes possess a soul. He cited the Concorde crash as his inspiration, feeling a sadness for the demise of the machine as well as the passengers. Clarkson was a passenger on the last BA Concorde flight on 24 October 2003. Paraphrasing Neil Armstrong he described the retirement of the fleet as "This is one small step for a man, but one huge leap backwards for mankind".[64]
He briefly acquired an English Electric Lightning F1A jet fighter XM172, which was installed in the front garden of his country home. The Lightning was subsequently removed on the orders of the local council, which "wouldn't believe my claim that it was a leaf blower", according to Clarkson on a Tiscali Motoring webchat. In fact, the whole affair was set up for his programme Speed, and the Lightning is now back serving as gate guardian at Wycombe Air Park (formerly RAF Booker).[65]
In a Top Gear episode, Clarkson drove the Bugatti Veyron in a race across Europe against a Cessna private aeroplane. The Veyron was an £850,000 technology demonstrator project built by Volkswagen to become the fastest production car, but a practical road car at the same time. In building such an ambitious machine, Clarkson described the project as "a triumph for lunacy over common sense, a triumph for man over nature and a triumph for Volkswagen over absolutely every other car maker in the world."[66] After winning the race, Clarkson announced that "It's quite a hollow victory really, because I've got to go for the rest of my life knowing that I'll never own that car. I'll never experience that power again."[67]
Clarkson wanted to purchase the Ford GT after admiring its inspiration, the Ford GT40 race cars of the 1960s. Clarkson was able to secure a place on the shortlist for the few cars that would be imported to Britain to official customers, only through knowing Ford's head of PR through a previous job. After waiting years and facing an increased price, he found many technical problems with the car. After "the most miserable month's motoring possible," he returned it to Ford for a full refund. After a short period, including asking Top Gear fans for advice over the Internet, he bought back his GT. He called it "the most unreliable car ever made", because he was never able to complete a return journey with it.[74] In 2006 Clarkson ordered a Gallardo Spyder and sold the Ford GT to make way for it. In August 2008 he sold the Gallardo because "idiots in Peugeots kept trying to race [him] in it".[77] In October, he announced that he had sold his Volvo XC90. In January 2009, in a review of the car printed in The Times, he wrote: "I’ve just bought my third Volvo XC90 in a row and the simple fact is this: it takes six children to school in the morning."[68]
Clarkson has spoken very highly of the Czech-made Škoda Yeti, calling it possibly the best car in the world; and used 20 minutes of a Top Gear episode putting the Yeti through a number of challenges to support his point.[78] Clarkson called the Brera, Alfa's latest sports car, "Cameron Diaz on wheels".[79] Clarkson has expressed fondness for late-model V8 Holdens, available in the UK rebadged as Vauxhalls. Of the Monaro he said, "It's like they had a picture of me on their desk and said [Australian accent] 'Let's build that bloke a car!'" and "I can't believe it... I've fallen in love... with a Vauxhall!"[80] Clarkson suffered two slipped discs that he attributed to driving the Monaro, which he described as being "back-breakingly marvellous".[81]
One of Clarkson's most infamous dislikes was of the British car brand Rover, the last major British owned and built car manufacturer. This view stretched back to the company's time as part of British Leyland. Describing the history of the company up to its last flagship model, the Rover 75, he paraphrased Winston Churchill and stated "Never in the field of human endeavour has so much been done, so badly, by so many.", citing issues with the rack and pinion steering system. In the latter years of the company Clarkson blamed the "uncool" brand image as being more of a hindrance to sales than any faults with the cars. On its demise, Clarkson stated "I cannot even get teary and emotional about the demise of the company itself – though I do feel sorry for the workforce." Jeremy is also famous for his hatred for the Toyota Prius.[82]
Clarkson is also well known for his criticism of Vauxhalls[83][84] and has described Vauxhall's parent company, General Motors, as a "pensions and healthcare" company which sees the "car making side of the business as an expensive loss-making nuisance".[84] Clarkson has expressed particular disdain for the Vauxhall Vectra, describing it as "One of my least favourite cars in the world. I've always hated it because I've always felt it was designed in a coffee break by people who couldn't care less about cars" and "one of the worst chassis I've ever come across".[85] After a Top Gear piece by Clarkson for its launch in 1995, described by The Independent as "not doing [GM] any favours",[86] Vauxhall complained to the BBC and announced, "We can take criticism but this piece was totally unbalanced."[87]
Clarkson's comments and actions have sometimes resulted in complaints from viewers, car companies, and national governments. In October 1998, Hyundai complained to the BBC about what they described as "bigoted and racist" comments he made at the Birmingham Motor Show, where he was reported as saying that the people working on the Hyundai stand had "eaten a dog" and that the designer of the Hyundai XG had probably eaten a spaniel for his lunch. Clarkson also allegedly referred to those working on the BMW stand as "Nazis", although BMW said they would not be complaining.[49] In a later incident during a Top Gear episode broadcast on 13 November 2005, Clarkson, while talking about a Mini design that might be "quintessentially German", made a mock Nazi salute, and made references to the Hitler regime and the German invasion of Poland by setting the GPS system to Poland.[88]
In April 2007, he was criticised in the Malaysian parliament for having described one of their cars, the Perodua Kelisa, as the worst in the world, "its name was like a disease and suggested it was built in jungles by people who wear leaves for shoes". A Malaysian government minister countered, pointing out that no complaints had been received from UK customers who had bought the car.[89][90]
While in Australia, Clarkson made disparaging remarks aimed at the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, in February 2009, calling him a "one-eyed Scottish idiot" and accused him of lying. These comments were widely condemned by the Royal National Institute of Blind People and also Scottish politicians who requested that he should be taken off air.[91][92][93][94] He subsequently apologised for referencing Brown's monocular blindness, but insisted: "I haven't apologised for calling him an idiot."[95]
In July 2009, Clarkson was reported to have called Prime Minister Brown "a silly cunt" during a warm-up while recording a Top Gear show. Although several newspapers reported that he had subsequently argued with BBC Two controller Janice Hadlow,[96] who was present at the recording, the BBC denied that he had been given a "dressing down".[97] John Whittingdale, Conservative chair of the Culture Select Committee remarked: "Many people will find that offensive, many people will find that word in particular very offensive [...] I am surprised he felt it appropriate to use it."[96]
On 6 July 2010, Clarkson reportedly angered gay rights campaigners after he made a remark on Top Gear that did not get aired on the 4 July's episode. But guest Alastair Campbell wrote about it on Twitter. Clarkson apparently said he "Demanded the right not to get bummed". The BBC later said that they cut this remark out as they "edited down" the interview as it was too long to fit into the show.[98]
His 4 September 2011 column for The Sun newspaper drew angry remarks[99] in response to Clarkson's call to abolish the Welsh language: "I think we are fast approaching the time when the United Nations should start to think seriously about abolishing other languages. What’s the point of Welsh for example? All it does is provide a silly maypole around which a bunch of hotheads can get all nationalistic."

On 30 November 2011 while being interviewed on the BBC's The One Show, Clarkson commented on the UK's public sector strike that day, lauding the capital's empty roads. After mentioning the BBC's need for balance, he said, "I would take them outside and execute them in front of their families." The programme later apologised for his remarks, with further apologies issued by Clarkson and the BBC.[100] These remarks had attracted 21,335 complaints to the BBC within 36 hours; the BBC also received 314 messages of support for Clarkson.[101]
Clarkson was criticised by the mental health charity Mind for his 3 December 2011 column for The Sun, in which he described those who jump in front of trains as "Johnny Suicide" and argues that following a death, trains should carry on their journeys as soon as possible. He adds: "The train cannot be removed nor the line re-opened until all of the victim's body has been recovered. And sometimes the head can be half a mile away from the feet." ... "Change the driver, pick up the big bits of what's left of the victim, get the train moving as quickly as possible and let foxy woxy and the birds nibble away at the smaller, gooey parts that are far away or hard to find."[102]
On 12 January, the Indian High Commission lodged a formal complaint with the BBC over the "tasteless" antics of Clarkson's Top Gear Christmas special where he mocked India's culture and people. During the 90-minute special, which was aired twice over the Christmas break, Clarkson made a string of jokes about Indian food, clothes, toilets, trains and history.[103]
On an episode of Top Gear broadcast on 5 February 2012, Clarkson compared a Japanese car/camper van to a person with a growth on their face. A major UK charity that supports people with facial disfigurements, Changing Faces, complained to the BBC and Ofcom after Clarkson's remarks.[104]
Clarkson often discusses high speed driving on public roads, criticising road safety campaigns involving cameras and speed bumps. In 2002, a Welsh Assembly Member Alun Pugh wrote to BBC director general Greg Dyke to complain about Clarkson's comments that he believed encouraged people to use Welsh roads as a high speed test track. A BBC spokesman said that suggestions Clarkson had encouraged speeding were "nonsense".[105] Clarkson has also made similar comments about driving in Lincolnshire.[106] As of 2004 Clarkson was reported as having a clean licence.[107] In a November 2005 Times article, Clarkson wrote on the Bugatti Veyron, "On a recent drive across Europe I desperately wanted to reach the top speed but I ran out of road when the needle hit 240 mph," and "From the wheel of a Veyron, France is the size of a small coconut. I cannot tell you how fast I crossed it the other day. Because you simply wouldn’t believe me."[108] In 2007, solicitor Nick Freeman represented Clarkson against a charge of driving at 86 mph in a 50 mph zone on the A40 road in London, defeating it on the basis that the driver of the car loaned to Clarkson from Alfa Romeo could not be ascertained.[109] In 2008, Clarkson claimed in a talk at the Hay Festival to have been given a speeding ticket for driving at 186 mph on the A1203 Limehouse Link road in London.[110]
In March 2004 at the British Press Awards, he swore at Morgan and punched him before being restrained by security; Morgan says it has left him with a scar above his left eyebrow.[111]
In 2004, the BBC apologised unreservedly and paid £250 in compensation to a Somerset parish council, after Clarkson damaged a 30-year-old horse-chestnut tree by driving into it to test the strength of a Toyota Hilux.[112] In December 2006 the BBC complaints department upheld the complaint of four Top Gear viewers that Clarkson had used the phrase "ginger beer" (rhyming slang for "queer") in a derogatory manner, when Clarkson picked up on and agreed with an audience member's description of the Daihatsu Copen as being a bit "gay".[113] The Top Gear: Polar Special was criticised by the BBC Trust for glamorising drink driving in a scene showing Clarkson and James May in a vehicle, despite Clarkson saying to the camera "And please do not write to us about drinking and driving, because I am not driving I am sailing." (as they were on top of international, frozen waters.)[114] They stated the scene "was not editorially justified" despite occurring outside the jurisdiction of any drink driving laws.
In November 2008, Clarkson attracted over 500 complaints to the BBC when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes.[115][116] The BBC stated the comment was a comic rebuttal of a common misconception about lorry drivers and was within the viewer's expectation of Clarkson's Top Gear persona.[115] Chris Mole, the Member of Parliament for Ipswich, where five prostitutes were murdered in 2006, wrote a "strongly worded" letter to BBC Director-General Mark Thompson, demanding that Clarkson be sacked.[116] Clarkson dismissed Mole's comments in his Sunday Times column the following weekend, writing, "There are more important things to worry about than what some balding and irrelevant middle-aged man might have said on a crappy BBC2 motoring show."[117] Andrew Tinkler, chief executive of the Eddie Stobart Group, a major trucking company, stated that "They were just having a laugh. It’s the 21st century, let’s get our sense of humour in line."[115]
In an episode aired after the watershed on 1 August 2010, Clarkson described a Ferrari F430 as "speciale needs". He said the car owned by co-presenter James May looked "like a simpleton". Media regulator Ofcom investigated after receiving two complaints, and found that the comments "were capable of causing offence" but did not censure the BBC.[118] In 2014 there were complaints and calls for Clarkson to be sacked after he used the word "slope" to describe an Asian man in a special episode.
In an unused take for a Top Gear feature recorded in early 2013, Clarkson is alleged to have mumbled the ethnic slur "nigger" in a children's rhyme. The clip later surfaced on the website of the Daily Mirror tabloid at the beginning of May 2014.[119] In the take, Clarkson attempts to mumble the sentence so as to obscure the word, but admitted that upon a close listening, the word could still be heard. Clarkson apologised for his efforts not being "quite good enough" to ensure the footage was not used.[120] It was reported on 3 May, that the BBC had given Clarkson a final warning, with the presenter accepting that he will be sacked if he makes another offensive remark.[121]

Jeremy Clarkson, born in Doncaster, England on 11 April 1960, is a TV present, journalist and writer. Jeremy Clarkson is best known for his role in the BBC car programme - Top Gear and also his outspoken non-politically correct views on a range of opinions.
“I don’t understand bus lanes. Why do poor people have to get to places quicker than I do?” - J.Clarkson
Typically, his outspoken nature has won him both admirers and detractors, but Jeremy Clarkson claims people shouldn't take him too seriously.
His parents ran a business selling tea cosies from their home town of Doncaster. After branching out into selling Paddington Bear toys, they became more successful and this enabled Jeremy Clarkson to go to Repton public school. By his own admission, Clarkson was expelled from Repton for a mixture of bad behaviour; he then took a job in his parents business selling Paddington Bear toys. In 1984, he formed a motoring agency, Motoring Press Agency, with journalist Jonathan Gill. This involved doing road tests of cars; this later led to writing pieces for Performance Car. His journalistic talents later gained him contracts for the Sun and Sunday Times. With his acerbic wit and bold reviews, Clarkson rarely sits on the fence, but makes his view known very clearly.
“This is a Renault Espace, probably the best of the people carriers. Not that that’s much to shout about. That’s like saying ‘Oh good, I’ve got syphilis, the best of the sexually transmitted diseases!’” J.Clarkson
 This makes for interesting journalism and TV, though car manufacturers who have been on the end of Clarkson's dismal reviews (such as Rover) have complained he can  be unfair.
On 27th October 1988, Clarkson was invited to be one of the presenters for the British motoring programme Top Gear. Despite a break between 2000 and 2002, this has been one of the longest running motoring shows and with his co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond, Top Gear has become one of the most watched TV shows on BBC Two.
The appeal of Top Gear has extended beyond motoring nuts, and the aim of the programme is as much about entertaining as information about the latest car models. Some have criticised this dumbing down of the programme; but the viewing figures show that many are enjoying the show, even though many of the comic moments are staged for the benefits of the show.
Jeremy Clarkson has become an icon for 'petrol heads' and non-political correctness. Sometimes his comments have landed him in hot water, such as disparaging comments about Norfolk, workers at Hyundai, global warming, speeding, cyclists and Wales. However, Clarkson claims he is not a serious commentator, but just tries to be funny. 
"I don't have any influence over what people do, I really don't. It makes no difference what I say. Top Gear is just fluff. It's just entertainment - people don't listen to me."
However, others are not convinced that Clarkson's comments carry no weight as his views can be influential in shaping some people's opinions of cars and wider issues. After criticising the Malaysian, Perodua Kelisa, as the the 'worst car in the world' built in 'jungles by people who wear leaves for shoes', he was criticised in the Malaysian parliament. 
But Clarkson tries to laugh off his comments. For example, when Clarkson caused upset by placing a 3D plastic map of Wales in a microwave, he defended himself by saying 'I Put Wales in there because Scotland wouldn't fit.'
In addition to career as a motoring journalist and presenter, Clarkson has presented documentaries on Science, military and Inventions that Changed the world. In the BBC programme - Great 100 Britons, Clarkson championed Isambard Kingdom Brunel and prominent engineer in the industrial revolution.
He has also been one of the most common presenters of the BBC satirical comedy - 'Have I Got News for You'
His fame is such that a petition was launched to make Jeremy Clarkson the next Prime Minister. It attracted over 40,000 signatures.

=======================================================
Jeremy Clarkson's parents owned a company which sold, amazingly, tea cosies. And obviously 'back in the day' there was a big demand for that sort of thing. So it's no wonder that, in credit crunching times, Jeremy had to find a new line of work. And what comes naturally after tea cosies? Fast cars, of course! 
Jeremy was kicked out of school for, reportedly, 'drinking, smoking and generally making a nuisance of himself'. He might be older now but that description still seems to fit. 
Clarkson is married, to his agent/manager Frances Cain. The pair tied the knot in 1993 and have three children, Emily, Finlo and Katya. 
You probably know this by now but Jeremy is pretty well-known for having some outspoken views. And there's nothing wrong with that. He's not a fan of political correctness, he hates the congestion charge in London, despises over-regulation, doesn't support any green agenda... the list could go on and on. 
His early career started in the local press, with Jeremy training as a Journalist before landing his first television presenting role on the BBC's Top Gear programme between 1988 and 2000. However the show wasn't a massive success and a lot of the team shifted over to Channel Five to make a rival version. But Clarkson was kept on for a re-vamped Top Gear. Now studio based, the show has gone on to be on the most popular programmes on British television and is shipped around the world. 
Remember 'Robot Wars' on BBC Two? Jeremy used to present it! He's also been seen on Room 101, Parkinson and Grumpy Old Men. 
Jeremy had a bit of a celebrity-struggle with Piers Morgan (Journalist and Britain's Got Talent judge) for a few years. Piers had initially printed pictures of Jeremy kissing his show producer, ending in Jeremy A) throwing water of Piers and B) punching him at an awards ceremony. As Harry Hill might say, FIGHT!!!
Jeremy polled a respectable 66th place in Channel 4's '100 Worst Britons We Love To Hate' programme.

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Jeremy Clarkson was born on April 11, 1960 in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England as Jeremy Charles Robert Clarkson. He is a writer and producer, known for Top Gear (2002), Top Gear (1978) and Clarkson (1998). He has been married to Frances Cain since May 1993. They have three children. He was previously married to Alexandra James.
      Was hit in the face with a pie by a protester whilst collecting his honorary degree for services to engineering from Oxford Brookes University
      Sold his Ferrari 355 Spyder to purchase a Mercedes-Benz SL55 AMG (which he loves). Also, purchased one of only twenty eight 2005 Ford GTs imported to England (with which he has had an innumerable amount of problems, but still loves).
      Owns the lighthouse cottages at the South end of Langness Peninsula in Derbyhaven, Isle Of Man.
      Smokers pay £19,000 a minute to the Exchequer, and that's enough to pay for the whole police force. Or to put it another way, for every £1 we cost the National Health Service, we give it £3.60. Please don't encourage the state to dictate how I live my life.
      "Only last week I was at my children's sports day and as I lay in the long grass by the river drinking pink champagne and chatting with other media parents, I remember thinking, 'God, I love being middle class'." (Sunday Times 24 July 2005)
      "Good Shot!" (In reaction to being hit in the face by a pie by a protester at his Honorary Degree ceremony)
      We all know that small cars are good for us. But so is cod liver oil. And jogging. I want to drive around in a Terminator, not the heroine in an EM Forster novel.
      Much more of a hoot to drive than you might imagine. Think of it, if you like, as a librarian with a G-string under the tweed. I do, and it helps.
      We only need look at Baroness Thatcher (Margaret Thatcher) to know what women can be like when they want to get in front.
      The problem is that television executives have got it into their heads that if one presenter on a show is a blonde-haired, blue-eyed heterosexual boy, the other must be a either black gay or a lesbian. Chalk and cheese, they reckon, works. But here we have Top Gear (2002) setting new records after six years using cheese and cheese. It confuses them.
      I read in the papers how much I'm earning and fall about laughing because I'm sure it's not that much, otherwise I'd have an enormous boat. I'm literally not the slightest bit interested in money. I just don't pay any attention to money, it's rather vulgar.

Controversial motormouth Jeremy Clarkson was born in Doncaster, his mum a teacher, his dad a travelling salesman. He began his journalistic career learning the ropes at the Rotherham Advertiser and would go on to write for several papers in the North of England.
His love of cars led him to set up the Motoring Press Agency, where he provided automobile-related content for magazines and newspapers. It was here that he began road testing and reviewing vehicles. He went on to write for Top Gear magazine, and writes a weekly column for both The Sun and The Sunday Times.
His big TV break came when he was chosen to present Top Gear in 1988, a programme he still fronts to this day. It is now the most-watched programme on BBC Two, following a revamp from its original format as a straight-ahead car review show to the more revved-up, explosion-filled boys with toys show that it is today.
Jeremy has been married twice, to Alexandra James from 1989 to 1990, and to his manager Frances Cain from 1993 onwards. He and Frances have three children.
