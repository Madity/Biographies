Stephen Tyrone Colbert (/koʊlˈbɛər/, né: /ˈkoʊlbərt/;[6] born May 13, 1964) is an American political satirist, writer, comedian, television host, and actor. He is the host of Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a satirical news show in which Colbert portrays a caricatured version of conservative political pundits. On April 10, 2014, Colbert was chosen to succeed David Letterman as the host of the Late Show on CBS after Letterman retires in 2015.[12]
Colbert originally studied to be an actor, but became interested in improvisational theatre when he met famed Second City director Del Close while attending Northwestern University. He first performed professionally as an understudy for Steve Carell at Second City Chicago; among his troupe mates were comedians Paul Dinello and Amy Sedaris, with whom he developed the sketch comedy series Exit 57.
Colbert also wrote and performed on the short-lived Dana Carvey Show before collaborating with Sedaris and Dinello again on the cult television series Strangers with Candy. He gained considerable attention for his role on the latter as closeted gay history teacher Chuck Noblet. His work as a correspondent on Comedy Central's news-parody series The Daily Show first introduced him to a wide audience.
In 2005, he left The Daily Show to host a spin-off series, The Colbert Report. Following The Daily Show's news-parody concept, The Colbert Report is a parody of personality-driven political opinion shows such as The O'Reilly Factor. Since its debut, the series has established itself as one of Comedy Central's highest-rated series, earning Colbert three Emmy Award nominations and an invitation to perform as featured entertainer at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in 2006. Colbert was named one of Time's 100 most influential people in 2006 and 2012.[13][14] His book I Am America (And So Can You!) was number one on The New York Times Best Seller list.
Colbert was born in Washington, D.C.,[15] and grew up in Charleston, South Carolina, on James Island, the youngest of 11 children in a Catholic family.[6][16][17] Colbert and his siblings, in order from oldest to youngest, are James ("Jimmy"), Edward ("Eddie"), Mary, William ("Billy"), Margo, Thomas ("Tommy"), Jay, Elizabeth ("Lulu"), Paul, Peter, and Stephen.
His father, James William Colbert, Jr., was a doctor and medical school dean at Yale University, Saint Louis University, and finally at the Medical University of South Carolina where he served as vice president for academic affairs. Stephen's mother, Lorna Colbert (née Tuck), was a homemaker.[18][19] In interviews, Colbert describes his parents as devout people who also strongly valued intellectualism and taught their children that it was possible to question the church and still be Catholic.[20] The emphasis his family placed on intelligence and his observation of negative stereotypes of Southerners led Colbert to train himself to suppress his Southern accent while he was still quite young. As a child, he observed that Southerners were often depicted as being less intelligent than other characters on scripted television; to avoid that stereotype, he taught himself to imitate the speech of American news anchors.[21][22]
Colbert sometimes comedically claims his surname is French, but his mother's ancestry was Irish, and his father's ancestry was mostly Irish, with some German and English.[6][23][24] Many of his ancestors emigrated from Ireland to North America in the 19th century before and during the Great Famine.[18][25] Originally, his surname was pronounced /ˈkoʊlbərt/ in English; Stephen Colbert's father, James, wanted to pronounce the name /koʊlˈbɛər/, but maintained the /ˈkoʊlbərt/ pronunciation out of respect for his own father. He offered his children the option to pronounce the name whichever way they preferred.[16] Stephen started using /koʊlˈbɛər/ later in life when he transferred to Northwestern University, taking advantage of the opportunity to reinvent himself in a new place where no one knew him.[6] Stephen's brother, Ed, an intellectual property attorney, retained /ˈkoʊlbərt/; this was shown in a February 12, 2009, appearance on The Colbert Report, when his youngest brother asked him, "/ˈkoʊlbərt/ or /koʊlˈbɛər/?" Ed responded "/ˈkoʊlbərt/", to which Stephen jokingly replied, "See you in Hell".[26]
On September 11, 1974, when Colbert was 10 years old, his father and two of his brothers, Peter and Paul, were killed in the crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 212 while it was attempting to land in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were en route to enroll the two boys at Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut.[17][27] Lorna Colbert relocated the family downtown to the more urban environment of East Bay Street in Charleston. Colbert found the transition difficult and did not easily make new friends in his new neighborhood.[16] Colbert later described himself during this time as detached, lacking a sense of importance regarding the things with which other children concerned themselves.[22][28] He developed a love of science fiction and fantasy novels, especially the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, of which he remains an avid fan. During his adolescence, he also developed an intense interest in fantasy role-playing games, especially Dungeons & Dragons,[28][29] a pastime which he later characterized as an early experience in acting and improvisation.[5]
Colbert attended Charleston's Episcopal Porter-Gaud School, where he participated in several school plays and contributed to the school newspaper but was not highly motivated academically.[28] During his adolescence, he briefly fronted a Rolling Stones cover band[30] called A Shot in the Dark.[31] When he was younger, he had hoped to study marine biology, but surgery intended to repair a severely perforated eardrum caused him inner ear damage. The damage was severe enough that he was unable to pursue a career that would involve scuba diving. The damage also left him deaf in his right ear.[16][32] For a while, he was uncertain whether he would attend college,[33] but ultimately he applied and was accepted to Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, where a friend had also enrolled. There he continued to participate in plays while studying mainly philosophy.[3][28] He found the curriculum rigorous, but was more focused than he had been in high school and was able to apply himself to his studies. Despite the lack of a significant theater community at Hampden-Sydney, Colbert's interest in acting escalated during this time. After two years, he transferred to Northwestern University as a theater major to study performance, emboldened by the realization that he loved performing, even when no one was coming to shows.[28]
While at Northwestern, Colbert studied with the intent of becoming a dramatic actor; mostly he performed in experimental plays and was uninterested in comedy. He began performing improvisation while in college, both in the campus improv team No Fun Mud Piranhas[34] and at the Annoyance Theatre in Chicago as a part of Del Close's ImprovOlympic at a time when the project was focused on competitive, long-form improvisation, rather than improvisational comedy. "I wasn't gonna do Second City", Colbert later recalled, "because those Annoyance people looked down on Second City because they thought it wasn't pure improv—there was a slightly snobby, mystical quality to the Annoyance people".[5] After Colbert graduated in 1986, however, he was in need of a job. A friend who was employed at Second City's box office offered him work answering phones and selling souvenirs.[28] Colbert accepted and discovered that Second City employees were entitled to take classes at their training center for free.[5] Despite his earlier aversion to the comedy group, he signed up for improvisation classes and enjoyed the experience greatly.
Shortly thereafter, he was hired to perform with Second City's touring company, initially as an understudy for Steve Carell. It was there he met Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello, with whom he often collaborated later in his career. By their retelling, the three comedians did not get along at first—Dinello thought Colbert was uptight, pretentious and cold, while Colbert thought of Dinello as "an illiterate thug"[35]—but the trio became close friends while touring together, discovering that they shared a similar comic sensibility.[28]
When Sedaris and Dinello were offered the opportunity to create a television series for HBO Downtown Productions, Colbert left The Second City and relocated to New York to work with them on the sketch comedy show Exit 57.[28] The series debuted on Comedy Central in 1995 and aired through 1996. Although it lasted for only 12 episodes, the show received favorable reviews[36][37] and was nominated for five CableACE Awards in 1995, in categories including best writing, performance, and comedy series.[38]
Following the cancellation of Exit 57, Colbert worked for six months as a cast member and writer on The Dana Carvey Show, alongside former Second City castmate Steve Carell, as well as Robert Smigel, Charlie Kaufman, Louis C.K., and Dino Stamatopoulos, among others. The series, described by one reviewer as "kamikaze satire" in "borderline-questionable taste", had sponsors pull out after its first episode aired and was cancelled after seven episodes.[39] Colbert then worked briefly as a freelance writer for Saturday Night Live with Robert Smigel. Smigel brought his animated sketch, The Ambiguously Gay Duo, to SNL from The Dana Carvey Show; Colbert provided the voice of Ace on both series, opposite Steve Carell as Gary. Needing money, he also worked as a script consultant for VH1 and MTV, before taking a job filming humorous correspondent segments for Good Morning America.[28] Only two of the segments he proposed were ever produced and only one aired, but the job led his agent to refer him to The Daily Show's then-producer, Madeline Smithberg, who hired Colbert on a trial basis in 1997.[40]
During the same period, Colbert worked again with Sedaris and Dinello to develop a new comedy series for Comedy Central, Strangers with Candy. Comedy Central picked up the series in 1998 after Colbert had already begun working on The Daily Show. As a result he accepted a reduced role, filming only around 20 Daily Show segments a year while he worked on the new series.[28]
Strangers with Candy was conceived of as a parody of after school specials, following the life of Jerri Blank, a 46-year-old dropout who returns to finish high school after 32 years of life on the street. Most noted by critics for its use of offensive humor, it concluded each episode by delivering to the audience a skewed, politically incorrect moral lesson.[41] Colbert served as a main writer alongside Sedaris and Dinello, and portrayed Jerri's strict but uninformed history teacher, Chuck Noblet, seen throughout the series dispensing inaccurate information to his classes. Colbert has likened this to the character he played on The Daily Show and later The Colbert Report, claiming that he has a very specific niche in portraying "poorly informed, high-status idiot" characters.[17] Another running joke throughout the series was that Noblet, a closeted homosexual, was having a "secret" affair with fellow teacher Geoffrey Jellineck despite the fact that their relationship was apparent to everyone around them. This obliviousness also appears in Colbert's Daily Show and Colbert Report character.
Thirty episodes of Strangers with Candy were made, which aired on Comedy Central in 1999 and 2000. Though its ratings were not remarkable during its initial run, it has been characterized as a cult show with a small but dedicated audience.[42] Colbert reprised his role for a film adaptation, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2005 and had a limited release in 2006. The film received mixed reviews. Colbert also co-wrote the screenplay with Sedaris and Dinello.[43]
Stephen Colbert joined the cast of Comedy Central's parody-news series The Daily Show in 1997, when the show was in its second season. Originally one of four correspondents who filmed segments from remote locations in the style of network news field reporters, Colbert was referred to as "the new guy" on-air for his first two years on the show, during which time Craig Kilborn served as host. When Kilborn left the show prior to the 1999 season, Jon Stewart took over hosting duties, also serving as a writer and co-executive producer. From this point, the series gradually began to take on a more political tone and increase in popularity, particularly in the latter part of the 2000 U.S. presidential election season. The roles of the show's correspondents were expanded to include more in-studio segments, as well as international reports which were almost always done in the studio with the aid of a greenscreen.[28]
Unlike Stewart, who essentially hosts The Daily Show as himself,[44] Colbert developed a correspondent character for his pieces on the series. Colbert has described his correspondent character as "a fool who has spent a lot of his life playing not the fool — one who is able to cover it at least well enough to deal with the subjects that he deals with".[28] Colbert was frequently pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects, or against Stewart in scripted exchanges, with the resultant dialogue demonstrating the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he is discussing.[8][28] Colbert also made generous use of humorous fallacies of logic in explaining his point of view on any topic. Other Daily Show correspondents have adopted a similar style; former correspondent Rob Corddry recalls that when he and Ed Helms first joined the show's cast in 2002, they "just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two".[10] Correspondent Aasif Mandvi has stated "I just decided I was going to do my best Stephen Colbert impression".[11]
Colbert has appeared in several recurring segments for The Daily Show, including "Even Stevphen" with Steve Carell,[45] in which both characters were expected to debate a selected topic but instead would unleash their anger at one another. Colbert commonly hosted "This Week in God", a report on topics in the news pertaining to religion, presented with the help of the "God Machine". Colbert filed reports from the floor of the Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention as a part of The Daily Show's award-winning coverage of the 2000 and 2004 U.S. Presidential elections; many from the latter were included as part of their The Daily Show: Indecision 2004 DVD release. In several episodes of The Daily Show, Colbert filled in as anchor in the absence of Jon Stewart, including the full week of March 3, 2002, when Stewart was scheduled to host Saturday Night Live. After Colbert left the show, Rob Corddry took over "This Week in God" segments, although a recorded sample of Colbert's voice is still used as the sound effect for the God Machine. Later episodes of The Daily Show have reused older Colbert segments under the label "Klassic Kolbert". Colbert won three Emmys as a writer of The Daily Show in 2004, 2005, and 2006.[46]
Colbert, in his television series persona, prepares to interview Michelle Obama. The set of The Colbert Report satirizes cable-personality political talk shows.
Since October 17, 2005, Colbert has hosted his own television show, The Colbert Report, a Daily Show spin-off which parodies the conventions of television news broadcasting,[21] particularly cable-personality political talk shows like The O'Reilly Factor and Glenn Beck.[5][47] Colbert hosts the show in-character as a blustery right-wing pundit, generally considered to be an extension of his character on The Daily Show. Conceived by co-creators Stewart, Colbert, and Ben Karlin in part as an opportunity to explore "the character-driven news", the series focuses less on the day-to-day news style of the Daily Show, instead frequently concentrating on the foibles of the host-character himself.
The concept for The Report was first seen in a series of Daily Show segments which advertised the then-fictional series as a joke. It was later developed by Stewart's Busboy Productions and pitched to Comedy Central, which greenlighted the program; Comedy Central had already been searching for a way to extend the successful Daily Show franchise beyond a half hour.[48] The series opened to strong ratings, averaging 1.2 million viewers nightly during its first week on the air. Comedy Central signed a long-term contract for The Colbert Report within its first month on the air, when it immediately established itself among the network's highest-rated shows.[49][50]
Much of Colbert's personal life is reflected in his character on The Colbert Report. With the extended exposure of the character on the show, he often references his interest in and knowledge of Catholicism, science fiction, and The Lord of the Rings, as well as using real facts to create his character's history. His alternate persona was also raised in South Carolina, is the youngest of 11 siblings and is married.[51] The actual Colbert's career history in acting and comedy, however, is often downplayed.
In July 2012, Colbert added two years to his contract with Comedy Central, extending the run of the Colbert Report until at least the end of 2014.[52]
On April 10, 2014, CBS announced in a press release[53] that Colbert "will succeed David Letterman as the host of The Late Show, effective when Mr. Letterman retires from the broadcast." As of April 10, the date on which Colbert will begin hosting the show has not been set; CBS stated a date will be chosen when Letterman decides his final show date.[12][54][55][56] Additionally, Colbert has stated that he will not be hosting the show as his satirical right wing persona that he uses for The Colbert Report.[57]
On Saturday, April 29, 2006, Stephen Colbert was the featured entertainer for the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner. Standing a few yards from U.S. President George W. Bush[58]—in front of an audience the Associated Press called a "Who's Who of power and celebrity"[59]—Colbert delivered a searing routine targeting the president and the media.[60] In his politically conservative character from The Colbert Report, Colbert satirized the George W. Bush Administration and the White House press corps with such lines as:
I stand by this man. I stand by this man because he stands for things. Not only for things, he stands on things. Things like aircraft carriers and rubble and recently flooded city squares. And that sends a strong message, that no matter what happens to America, she will always rebound—with the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world.[61]
Colbert received a chilly response from the audience.[62] His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, apart from the enthusiastic laughter of a few in the audience.[63] The major media outlets paid little attention to it initially. Washington Post columnist Dan Froomkin and Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism professor Todd Gitlin claimed that this was because Colbert's routine was as critical of the media as it was of Bush.[64][65] Richard Cohen, also writing for The Washington Post, responded that the routine was not funny.[66] The video of Colbert's performance became an internet and media sensation,[67][68] while, in the week following the speech, ratings for The Colbert Report rose by 37% to average just under 1.5 million total viewers per episode.[69] In Time magazine James Poniewozik called it "the political-cultural touchstone issue of 2006".[70] Writing six months later, New York Times columnist Frank Rich referred to Colbert's speech as a "cultural primary" and called it the "defining moment" of the 2006 midterm elections.[71][72]
Wikinews has related news: Colbert officially withdraws Presidential bid; Obama supporters pressured South Carolina
Under his fictional persona in The Colbert Report, Colbert dropped hints of a potential presidential run throughout 2007, with speculation intensifying following the release of his book, I Am America (And So Can You!), which was rumored to be a sign that he was indeed testing the waters for a future bid for the White House. On October 16, 2007, he announced his candidacy on his show, stating his intention to run both on the Republican and Democratic platforms, but only as a "favorite son" in his native South Carolina.[73] He later abandoned plans to run as a Republican due to the $35,000 fee required to file for the South Carolina primary,[74] however he continued to seek a place on the Democratic ballot and on October 28, 2007, campaigned in the South Carolina state capital of Columbia, where he was presented with the key to the city by Mayor Bob Coble.[75]
After announcing his presidential ticket, he asked his viewers to cast their votes by donating to DonorsChoose.org, an online charity connecting individuals to classrooms in need.[76] Colbert's promotion inspired $68,000 in donations to South Carolina classrooms, which benefited over 14,000 low-income students.[77] Colbert teamed up with DonorsChoose.org again in 2008 by asking supporters of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to do the same. As a lead-up to the Pennsylvania primary, he created a "straw poll that makes a difference", where people could donate to Pennsylvania classroom projects in honor of their favorite candidate.[78] Colbert viewers donated $185,000 to projects reaching 43,000 students in Pennsylvania public schools.[79]
On November 1, 2007, the South Carolina Democratic Party executive council voted 13–3 to refuse Colbert's application onto the ballot. "The general sense of the council was that he wasn't a serious candidate and that was why he wasn't selected to be on the ballot", stated John Werner, the party's director. In addition, he was declared "not viable",[80] as he was running in only one state.[81] Several days later he announced that he was dropping out of the race, saying that he did not wish to put the country through an agonizing Supreme Court battle.[82] CNN has reported that Obama supporters pressured the South Carolina Democratic Executive Council to keep Colbert off the ballot. One anonymous member of the council told CNN that former State Superintendent of Education Inez Tenenbaum had placed pressure on them to refuse Colbert's application despite his steady rise in polls.[83]
Though Colbert's real-life presidential campaign had ended, current Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Joe Quesada established in an interview on The Colbert Report that Colbert's campaign was still going strong in the fictional Marvel Universe, citing the cover art of a then-recent issue of The Amazing Spider-Man which featured a Colbert campaign billboard in the background. Background appearances of Colbert campaign ads continued to appear in Marvel Comics publications, as recently as August 2008's Secret Invasion #5 (which also features a cameo of an alien Skrull posing as Colbert). In October 2008, Colbert made an extended 8-page appearance webslinging with Spider-Man in The Amazing Spider-Man issue #573.[84]
Stephen Colbert arrived in Baghdad, Iraq on June 5, 2009, to film a week of shows called "Operation Iraqi Stephen: Going Commando" sponsored by the USO (United Service Organizations).[85] Colbert had a suit tailored for him in the Army Combat Uniform pattern.[86] During the first episode (which featured a cameo appearance from U.S. president Barack Obama), Colbert had his hair cropped in a military style to show his solidarity with the troops. One Army major said that "shaving of the hair is an amazing show of support" that was "very touching." USO Senior Vice President John Hanson said the shows are an important diversion for the troops.[87]
On September 24, 2010, Colbert testified in character before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Security. He was invited by committee chairwoman Zoe Lofgren to describe his experience participating in the United Farm Workers' "Take Our Jobs" program, where he spent a day working alongside migrant workers in upstate New York.[88][89][90] At the end of his often-humorous testimony, Colbert broke character in responding to a question from Rep. Judy Chu, D-CA, and explained his purpose for being at the hearing:
I like talking about people who don't have any power, and this seems like one of the least powerful people in the United States are migrant workers who come and do our work, but don't have any rights as a result. And yet we still invite them to come here and at the same time ask them to leave. And that's an interesting contradiction to me. And, you know, 'Whatsoever you do for the least of my brothers,' and these seem like the least of our brothers right now... Migrant workers suffer and have no rights.[91]
Democratic committee member John Conyers questioned whether it was appropriate for the comedian to appear before Congress and asked him to leave the hearing.[92] Though Colbert offered to depart at the direction of the committee chairwoman, Lofgren requested that he stay at least until all opening testimony had been completed, whereupon Conyers withdrew his request.[93]
'Painfully awkward and pointless, it made the committee's majority members look ridiculous. Colbert can be very funny, but his kind of sarcasm only works in some contexts, and a House committee hearing room does not appear to be one of them.' - Yuval Levin, The Corner[92][95]
'As John Conyers notes, the media and spectators turned out to see whether Colbert would address the panel seriously as an expert on immigration and make the panel a joke, or stay in character and make the panel a bigger joke,' - Ed Morrissey, Hot Air.[92][96]
In September 2010, following Glenn Beck's Restoring Honor rally, a campaign developed that called for Colbert to hold his own rally at the Lincoln Memorial.[97] On the September 10, 2010, episode of the Daily Show[98] and the Colbert Report, Stewart and Colbert made preannouncements of a future event. On September 16, 2010, Stewart and Colbert announced competing rallies on the Washington, DC, Mall on October 30, 2010, Stewart's "Rally to Restore Sanity", and Colbert's "March to Keep Fear Alive". Both were eventually merged into the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear.
In May 2011, Colbert filed a request with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) asking for a media exemption for coverage of his political action committee, ColbertPAC, on The Colbert Report.[99][100]
In June 2011, during a public meeting, the FEC voted 5–1 to grant The Colbert Report a limited media exemption. The exemption allows unlimited donations of airtime and show resources to promote the Colbert Super PAC without requiring disclosure to the FEC, but only for ads appearing on The Colbert Report. Following the hearing, Colbert formally filed paperwork for the creation of his Super PAC with the FEC secretary.[101]
After the 2012 New Hampshire primary, a poll for the subsequent South Carolina primary taken by Public Policy Polling (of 1,112 likely GOP voters, Jan 5–7, 2012) was reported to place Stephen Colbert at 5%, one point ahead of Jon Huntsman polling at 4%, in spite of the fact that Colbert was not on the ballot. This poll showed Colbert to be closely behind Rick Perry's 7% and Ron Paul's 8% (with Romney at 27%, Gingrich 23% and Santorum at 18%). On the January 11 episode of the Colbert Report, Colbert asked his audience if he should run for President in South Carolina, to which he received strong applause. He then stated that he would be making a "Major Announcement" during the next day's show. On January 12, Colbert started his show by discussing his role in the Presidential campaign, then addressed the law preventing him from being a Presidential candidate while running his Super PAC. With the help of his lawyer Trevor Potter, he then signed over control of his Super PAC to Jon Stewart, with the organization title then being referred to as "The Definitely Not Coordinating With Stephen Colbert Super PAC".[102] Immediately after this legal block was out of the way, Colbert announced, "I am forming an exploratory committee to lay the groundwork for my possible candidacy for the President of the United States of South Carolina. I'm doin' it!" He reiterated in the interview portion of that show that "I'm still in the exploratory phase" of his Presidential campaign.
On the January 16, 2012, episode, Colbert encouraged his viewers to vote for Herman Cain in the South Carolina primary. As Cain was still on the ballot, despite having recently dropped out of the race, Colbert announced that he would consider any votes cast for Cain to be in direct support of his own possible candidacy.
Stephen Colbert is co-author of the satirical text-and-picture novel Wigfield: The Can Do Town That Just May Not, which was published in 2003 by Hyperion Books. The novel was a collaboration between Colbert, Amy Sedaris, and Paul Dinello, and tells the story of a small town threatened by the impending destruction of a massive dam. The narrative is presented as a series of fictional interviews with the town's residents, accompanied by photos. The three authors toured performing an adaptation of Wigfield on stage the same year the book was released.[103]
Colbert appeared in a small supporting role in the 2005 film adaptation of Bewitched. He has made guest appearances on the television series Curb Your Enthusiasm, Spin City, and Law & Order: Criminal Intent,[104] and on the first season of the US improvisational comedy show Whose Line Is It Anyway?. He voiced the characters of Reducto and Phil Ken Sebben in the Adult Swim's Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, but left the show in 2005 to work on The Colbert Report. His characters were both killed, though he returned to voice Phil for the series finale. Colbert also has provided voices for Cartoon Network's The Venture Bros., Comedy Central's Crank Yankers, and American Dad!, as well as for Canadian animated comedy series The Wrong Coast. He appeared as Homer Simpson's life coach, Colby Krause, in the Simpsons episode "He Loves to Fly and He D'ohs".[105][106]
Colbert filled in for Sam Seder on the second episode of The Majority Report on Air America Radio, and has also done reports for The Al Franken Show. He appeared on a track on Wig in a Box, a tribute album for Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Colbert read the part of Leopold Bloom in Bloomsday on Broadway XXIV: Love Literature Language Lust: Leopold's Women Bloom on June 16, 2005 at Symphony Space in New York City.[20] He appeared in a series of TV commercials for General Motors, as a not-too-bright investigator searching for the elusive (and non-existent in real life) "Mr. Goodwrench". He also portrayed the letter Z in Sesame Street: All-Star Alphabet, a 2005 video release.
Colbert is a producer of The 1 Second Film, the world's largest nonprofit collaborative art film. His video request that IMDb list his credit for The 1 Second Film ("it is as valid as most of my credits") enabled thousands of the film's producers to be listed in the massive movie database until they were removed in early 2007.[107]
Colbert has released one book associated with The Colbert Report, I Am America (And So Can You!). It was released on October 7, 2007 by Grand Central Publishing. Grand Central Publishing is the successor to Warner Books, which published America (The Book), written by The Daily Show staff. The book contains similar political satire, but was written primarily by Colbert himself rather than as a collaboration with his Colbert Report writing staff.[108]
On November 23, 2008, his Christmas special, A Colbert Christmas: The Greatest Gift of All!, aired on Comedy Central. It was released on DVD in November 2008.[109]
In January 2010, Colbert was named the assistant sports psychologist for the US Olympic speed skating team at the 2010 Winter Olympics.[110][111] He was also invited to be part of NBC's 2010 Winter Olympics coverage team by Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Universal Sports.[112] In April 2011, Colbert performed as Harry in the revival of Stephen Sondheim's musical Company, presented by the New York Philharmonic at the Lincoln Center.[113] The show, featuring Neil Patrick Harris in the starring role, ran for four nights and was filmed for later showings in movie theaters, which began June 15.[113] In May 2011, Colbert joined Charleston to Bermuda Race yachting race, as the captain of ship "the Spirit of Juno".[114] He finished second, five miles behind leaders "Tucana".[115]
After the resignation of South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint to run the Heritage Foundation, Colbert was named a possible candidate for appointment to the seat being vacated by DeMint, which will trigger a special election in 2014 to finish out DeMint's term. Although Governor Nikki Haley announced promptly that she had no intention to nominate Colbert to the Senate, a poll showed Colbert as a favorite among South Carolina voters.[116] [117]
Although, by his own account, he was not particularly political before joining the cast of The Daily Show, Colbert has described himself as a Democrat according to a 2004 interview.[118][119] In an interview at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard Institute of Politics, he stated that he has "no problems with Republicans, just Republican policies."[120] Colbert is a practicing Roman Catholic and a Sunday school teacher.[20][121][122][123]
Colbert lives in Montclair, New Jersey,[124] with his wife, Evelyn McGee-Colbert, who appeared with him in an episode of Strangers with Candy as his mother. She also had an uncredited cameo as a nurse in the series pilot and a credited one (as his wife, Clair) in the film. McGee-Colbert actually met Jon Stewart, later a good friend of Colbert, before she met her husband in 1990. She is the daughter of prominent Charleston civil litigator Joseph McGee, of the firm Buist Moore Smythe McGee. The couple has three children: Madeleine, Peter, and John.[125] Colbert prefers, however, that his children not watch his show The Colbert Report, saying that "kids can't understand irony or sarcasm, and I don't want them to perceive me as insincere."[22]
In 2000 Colbert and the other Daily Show writers were the recipients of three Emmy Awards as writers for The Daily Show and again in 2005 and 2006. In 2005 he was nominated for a Satellite Award for his performance on The Colbert Report and again in 2006.[46]
He was also nominated for three Emmys for The Colbert Report in 2006, including Best Performance in a Variety, Musical Program or Special, which he lost to Barry Manilow. Manilow and Colbert would go on to jokingly sign and notarize a revolving biannual custody agreement for the Emmy on the Colbert Report episode aired on October 30, 2006. He lost the same category to Tony Bennett in 2007 and Don Rickles in 2008.
In January 2006, the American Dialect Society named truthiness, which Colbert coined on the premiere episode of The Colbert Report, as its 2005 Word of the Year. Colbert devoted time on five successive episodes to bemoaning the failure of the Associated Press to mention his role in popularizing the word truthiness in its news coverage of the Word of the Year.[127][128] On December 9, 2006, Merriam-Webster also announced that it selected truthiness as its Word of the Year for 2006. Votes were accepted on their website, and according to poll results, "truthiness" won by a five-to-one margin.[129]
In June 2006, after speaking at the school's commencement ceremony, Colbert received an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts degree from Knox College.[130] Time named Stephen Colbert as one of the 100 most influential people in 2006 and 2012[13][14] and in May 2006, New York magazine listed Colbert (and Jon Stewart) as one of its top dozen influential persons in media.[131] Colbert was named Person of the Year by the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado on March 3, 2007[132] and was also given the Speaker of the Year Award by The Cross Examination Debate Association (CEDA) on March 24, 2007 for his "drive to expose the rhetorical shortcomings of contemporary political discourse".[133]
Colbert was named the 2nd Sexiest TV News Anchor in September 2006 by Maxim Online, next to Mélissa Theuriau of France and was the only man featured on the list.[134] In November 2006, he was named a "sexy surprise" by People in the Sexiest Man Alive honors[135] and in the December 2006 issue of GQ he was named one of GQ's "Men of the Year".[136] In 2012, he was listed as #69 on Maxim Magazine's Hot 100, becoming the first man to be included on the list.[137]
He was nominated for a TCA Award for The Colbert Report by the Television Critics Association in 2006 and also received two Peabody Awards for his work on The Daily Show: Indecision 2000 and Indecision 2004. In February 2007, Ben & Jerry's unveiled a new ice cream flavor in honor of Colbert, named Stephen Colbert's AmeriCone Dream. Colbert waited until Easter to sample the ice cream because he "gave up sweets for Lent".[138] Colbert will donate all proceeds to charity through the new Stephen Colbert AmeriCone Dream Fund, which will distribute the money to various causes.[139]
After the Saginaw Spirit defeated the Oshawa Generals in Ontario Junior League Hockey, Oshawa Mayor John Gray declared March 20, 2007 (the mayor's own birthday) Stephen Colbert Day, honoring a previous bet with Stephen. At the event, Mayor Gray referred to the publicity the bet brought the city, remarking, "This is the way to lose a bet".[140]
Colbert was honored for the Gutsiest Move on the Spike TV Guys' Choice Awards on June 13, 2007 for his performance at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner.[141] In August 2007, Virgin America named an airplane. "Air Colbert", in his honor.[142] On October 28, 2007, Colbert received the key to the city of Columbia, South Carolina from Mayor Bob Coble.[143]
In 2007 a species of trapdoor spider was named Aptostichus stephencolberti after Colbert.[144] The spider was discovered on the California coastline in 2007.[145] The spider was named after Colbert after he reported on his television series that Jason Bond, a professor of biology at East Carolina University, named a different species of spider Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi, after the Canadian rock star Neil Young and he began to appeal for a species of animal to be named after him.[146] On a later edition of The Colbert Report, Colbert revealed that Bond would name a spider after him, with Colbert claiming, "And all I had to do was shamelessly beg on national television."[147]
On December 20, 2007, Colbert was named Celebrity of the Year by The Associated Press.[148] On April 2, 2008 he received a Peabody Award for The Colbert Report, saying in response, "I proudly accept this award and begrudgingly forgive the Peabody Committee for taking three years to recognize greatness".[149]
In 2008, Colbert won the Emmy award for writing again, this time as a writer for the Colbert Report. Colbert delivered the Class Day address to the graduating class of Princeton University on June 2, 2008, and accepted the Class of 2008 Understandable Vanity Award, consisting of a sketch of Colbert and a mirror.[150] He also has been announced as the Person of the Year for the 12th annual Webby Awards.[151]
In January 2010, Colbert received the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for his album A Colbert Christmas: The Greatest Gift of All!. He also announced the nominees for Song of the Year while toting a pre-released Apple iPad.[152] Colbert was the 2011 commencement speaker for Northwestern University, and received an honorary degree.[153]
In 2014, Colbert won the 2014 Best Spoken Word Album for his audiobook America Again: Re-becoming The Greatness We Never Weren't.
In 2009, NASA engineered a new treadmill for the International Space Station. It was brought to the ISS by the Space Shuttle Discovery during the STS-128 mission in August 2009. The complex machine is now used eight hours daily by astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the space station in order to maintain their muscle mass and bone density while spending long periods of time in a zero-gravity environment. While engineers at NASA were constructing this treadmill, it was simply called T-2 for more than two years. However, on April 14, 2009, NASA renamed it the "Combined Operational Load-Bearing External Resistance Treadmill", or COLBERT.[154] NASA named the treadmill after Colbert,[155] who took an interest during the Node 3 naming census for the ISS module, Tranquility.
Colbert urged his followers to post the name "Colbert", which upon completion of the census received the most entries totaling 230,539, some 40,000 votes more than the second-place choice, Serenity.[156] The COLBERT is expected to last the life of the ISS and will have seen about 38,000 miles of running when the Space Station is retired in 2020 but was also built with 150,000 mile lifespan if needed till 2028 or longer. Colbert realized he was the recipient of an extremely rare honor when astronaut Suni Williams came on The Colbert Report to announce that NASA had named the treadmill after him. Despite being a backronym, the COLBERT is the only piece of NASA engineered equipment in space that is named after a living human being.[157]

Colbert in an open, hour-long interview and Q & A session arranged by Harvard's Institute of Politics. He speaks about the nature of his TV-show character and the interplay between wearing the mask and using it to make political points.

          Stephen Colbert (pronounced "col-BEAR") was born on May 13, 1964, and grew up in Charleston, South Carolina.He studied acting at Northwestern and performed with the Second City comedy troupe in Chicago before teaming up with fellow cast members Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello to create the sketch comedy Exit 57 (1995) for Comedy Central. During its two-season run in the mid-1990s, it garnered five CableACE nominations for best writing, performing, and comedy series. After the demise of Exit 57 (1995) from 1997 (until his departure in October 2005), Stephen was a correspondent on The Daily Show (1996), then hosted by Craig Kilborn. Initially billed as "The New Guy," Stephen became the show's longest-running correspondent before getting his own show, The Colbert Report (2005), which has done well in its slot following The Daily Show (1996).At the time he left The Daily Show (1996), Stephen had been its longest-running and most diverse correspondent. In addition to his role as Senior Political Correspondent, he was one of the hosts of "Even Stepheven," a point-counterpoint assault featuring co-correspondent Steve Carell, and the host of "This Week in God," a recurring segment in which he reported on all things theological with the assistance of the "God Machine."Stephen helped The Daily Show (1996) win numerous Emmy and Peabody Awards and contributed to "America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction" (Warner Books) which immediately topped the New York Times bestseller list and stayed there for 15 consecutive weeks.His personality, intelligence, and leftist political satire could only have led him to The Colbert Report (2005), a half-hour nightly platform for him to give his tongue-in-cheek take on the issues of the day, and more importantly, to tell you why he thinks everyone else's take is just plain wrong.His other notable credits include serving as both writer and cast member on The Dana Carvey Show (1996), writing for Saturday Night Live (1975), and providing the voice of Ace in Robert Smigel's "Ambiguously Gay Duo," which originated on The Dana Carvey Show (1996) and was a semi-regular feature in Smigel's "TV Funhouse" segment on SNL. He was also featured on "Mr. Goodwrench" commercials (2003-2005).Stephen lives in northern New Jersey with his wife and three children.
      An alumnus of the Second City and Annoyance Theatre in Chicago, Illinois. Graduated from Northwestern University in 1986.
      Provided the voice of Ace for Saturday Night Live (1975)'s "The Ambiguously Gay Duo" segments. The voice of Gary is provided by fellow The Daily Show (1996) correspondent Steve Carell.
      Is a huge Lord of the Rings fan and has an encyclopedic knowledge of the series. Specifically recited the entire biography of LOTR character Aragorn from memory when Viggo Mortensen appeared on The Daily Show (1996). Mortensen kindly sent Colbert a platter full of LOTR characters carved out of chocolate.
      Most of the shows he has been a part of are on Comedy Central. These shows are Exit 57 (1995), The Daily Show (1996), Strangers with Candy (1999), and The Colbert Report (2005).
      Was included in the Peabody Award given to [error] and The Daily Show: Indecision 2002: Election Night (2002) for "offering biting political satire, these scintillating segments had something droll and amusing to say about almost everything and everyone associated with American politics and the presidential election.".
      His father and two of his brothers died in a plane crash when he was ten years old. On September 11, 1974, they were on an Eastern Airlines DC-9 that crashed in dense fog during its approach to Charlotte, N.C. Of the 82 people on board, 72 were killed. In its report, the NTSB concluded that "the probable cause of the accident was the flight crew's lack of altitude awareness at critical points during the approach due to poor cockpit discipline in that the crew did not follow prescribed procedures.".
      Occasionally replaced Jon Stewart as anchor of The Daily Show (1996) while Jon was occupied with other things.
      Lent his voice to some attack ads that were used for the The 78th Annual Academy Awards (2006), hosted by Jon Stewart.
      "Truthiness," a word he coined, was declared the Word of the Year 2005 by the American Dialect Society.
      Has stated that not all of his family members say "Colbert" the way he does. Some pronounce the "T" at the end.
      Is currently in the process of putting together news pieces about every district in the United States.
      Teaches Sunday School every weekend at his church and teaches his own specific story of salvation and has the children learn spiritual songs.
      As a result of the plane crash that killed his father and two of his brothers, the Federal Aviation Administration established the "sterile cockpit" rule, which prohibits flight crews from engaging in any conversation or activities apart from their flying duties while the aircraft is below 10,000 feet.
      As a result of an operation he had when he was young, he can fold his right ear inside out and can pop it out when he squints his eye.
      His father was of Irish, as well as some English and German, descent. His mother was of Irish ancestry.
      His siblings from oldest to youngest are: Jimmy, Eddie, Mary, Billy, Margo, Tommy, Jay, Lulu, Paul, and Peter. Stephen is the youngest of the eleven.
      Stephen often sings and dances in television performances. He has said in interviews that he studied voice and ballet in college.
      In January 2008, Colbert began a campaign on his show to have a portrait of his character hung in the "Treasures of American History" exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, DC (pieces shown in that exhibit included a top hat worn by' Abraham Lincoln', an original light bulb made by Thomas A. Edison, a Greensboro, North Carolina, lunch counter that was the scene of a seminal civil rights sit-in, Lewis and Clark's compass, and Kermit the Frog). When the National Museum of American History refused the portrait, Colbert next offered it to the National Portrait Gallery (also a Smithsonian museum), which accepted it on a temporary basis and hung it between the bathrooms adjacent to the Hall of Presidents. After the portrait's term at the National Portrait Gallery was up, the National Museum of American History did agree to hang the portrait - next to a Dumbo car from the original Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride at Disneyland.
      Worked alongside Louis C.K., Charlie Kaufman and Robert Smigel on the writing staff of The Dana Carvey Show (1996).
      His older sister, Elizabeth Colbert Busch (aka Lulu), is the 2014 South Carolina Democratic congressional candidate. Her Republican opponent will be Gov. Mark Sanford [April 2013].
      Release of the book, "Wigfield: The Can-Do Town That Just May Not" by Stephen and Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello.
      [on what he would like to ask former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean] The media tries to portray you as an angry candidate. Doesn't that piss you off?
      [To Howard Kurtz on CNN's Reliable Sources (1992) January 25, 2004] We have no desire to make anybody look like a blithering idiot, but we do love it when they do. Because we get it off the AP feed and, then, we don't have to write anything for the next five minutes. We can just roll the tape.
      [Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City, UT), January 23, 2004] Since there's not more news than there used to be, but there's way more time, and more channels doing it all the time, so that analysis has become much more than news . . . They really have to fill and they go, "(Expletive), we'll just have analysis for the next three hours," because there's no more new on the story. And then . . . the first person with a semi-cogent thought, they go, "(Expletive), I'll say that, too." And then that analysis becomes accepted dogma because analysis is the bulk of what you're getting. You're not really getting any more news.
      [The Union Leader (Manchester NH, January 25, 2004, when asked why people should watch The Daily Show (1996)] You shouldn't listen to us at all if you're looking for information. We don't take ourselves seriously on any level; we're just comedians . . . I'm a huge news junkie. I love what the news does. And we're a shadow, a reflection, of what's happening in the real news.
      [on his mock "crusade" against the Associated Press regarding his claim that coined the word "truthiness"] It's a sin of omission, is what it is. You're not giving people the whole story about truthiness. It's like Shakespeare still being alive and not asking him what "Hamlet" is about.
      The fact that they looked it up in a book just shows that they don't get the idea of truthiness at all. You don't look up truthiness in a book, you look it up in your gut.
      [about the Washington press corps] But, listen, let's review the rules. Here's how it works. The President makes decisions, he's the decider. The Press Secretary announces those decisions, and you people of the press type those decisions down. Make, announce, type. Put them through a spell check and go home. Get to know your family again. Make love to your wife. Write that novel you got kicking around in your head. You know, the one about the intrepid Washington reporter with the courage to stand up to the administration. You know, fiction.
      [on his creativity] I wrote things for the school's newspaper, and - like all teenagers - I dabbled in poetry.
      [on writing] I used to write things for friends. There was this girl I had a crush on, and she had a teacher she didn't like at school. I had a real crush on her, so almost every day I would write her a little short story where she would kill him in a different way.
      [stating that the best moment in the 2004 campaign for Democratic presidential nominee was Howard Dean's post-Iowa speech] Because clearly everybody was captivated by it. I think that's an argument why he should be President, because he can capture everyone's attention. Listen, George W. Bush was a cheerleader. I'm sure he screamed like that when he was at Yale, and I don't see why that disqualifies someone from being President. But George Bush did it in a human pyramid.
      When Jon Stewart got The Daily Show (1996), [Colbert's wife Evelyn McGee] said, "Wait a second--he wasn't the funny one in our group. He was the quiet one in the corner with a beer".
      I was never interested in political comedy: "Ted Kennedy 's hitting the bottle again!'" Jon Stewart taught me how to do it so it would be smart. He encouraged everyone to have a point of view. There had to be a thought behind every joke.
      [Remembering the 2000 presidential election recount] We all had such blue balls from the jokes we wanted to do when Al Gore eventually conceded. And the night it happened, here we were doing them. I turned to Jon Stewart and said, "This is the most fun job on TV right now".
      Citizens United said that transparency would be the disinfectant, but (c)(4)'s are warm, wet, moist incubators. There is no disinfectant.
      My brother Billy was the joke teller. My brother Jim had a really sharp, cutting wit. And the teller of long stories, that was my brother Ed. As a child, I just absorbed everything they said, and I was always in competition for the laughs.
      [In his junior year in high school]: I was probably still Colbert to a lot of people. But in my mind I was coal-BARE."
      The trouble with the jokes is that once they're written, I know how they're supposed to work, and all I can do is not hit them. I'm more comfortable improvising. If I have just two or three ideas and I know how the character feels, what the character wants, everything in between is like trapeze work.
      My character is a patriot, and he believes that the Olympics are war. It's a way to prove who's got the best country. Only nobody gets hurt.
      My character isn't ironically detached, he's ironically a-ttached; things are important to him.
      [In 2009] I know what you're thinking: "Isn't the Iraq War over?" That's what I thought, too. I hadn't seen it in the media for a while, and when I don't see something, I assume it's vanished forever, like in that terrifying game peekaboo. We stopped seeing much coverage of the Iraq War back in September when the economy tanked, and I just figured the insurgents were wiped out because they were heavily invested in Lehman Brothers.Turns out there are still 135,000 troops in Iraq, which I don't understand because we've already won the war. And we've won it so many times. We should win something for the number of times we've won it. We eliminated the weapons of mass destruction by having them not exist. We took out Saddam Hussein-or a really convincing and committed Saddam Hussein double. We helped write the Iraqi Constitution and clearly gave Iraqis the right to bear a lot of arms. And by August of next year we'll withdraw every single one of our troops, leaving behind only memories and 50,000 troops.But despite our continued victories, Americans have many lingering questions about Iraq. For example: where is Iraq? My guess is somewhere near Paraguay.
      [on preparing to replace David Letterman on 'The Late Show' in 2015] There are some huge shoes to fill. And some really big pants.

Birth Place: Charleston, South Carolina, United StatesDate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 05/13/1964, TaurusProfession: TV talk-show host; actor; writer; producer
Sardonic, deadpan and drier than a desert at noon, this bespectacled satirist became such a popular correspondent on the mock-news series The Daily Show that he earned his own spin-off. Growing up in South Carolina, Colbert suffered tragedy early on when his father and two of his 10 siblings were killed in a 1974 plane crash. He took solace in acting, and, after graduating from college with a theater degree, he joined Chicago's celebrated Second City, where he met Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello. The trio went on to create and star in two cult Comedy Central series: the critically acclaimed, if short-lived, sketch show Exit 57, and the after-school-specials spoof Strangers with Candy, which spawned a film of the same name. During his Candy run, Colbert pulled double comedic duty on The Daily Show, fashioning the unsmiling, uninformed conservative persona that became his trademark. In 2005, his Republican alter ego became the darling of the liberal set on The Colbert Report, a parody of egotistical, Bill O'Reilly-type opinion shows. The surreal, satiric show earned multiple Emmy awards and shot Colbert into fame...and made him very much a part of the pop culture he often---hilariously---skewers.Stephen Colbert Fast Facts:
Was the voice of Ace (and Steve Carell was Gary) on the animated "Ambiguously Gay Duo" sketches on Saturday Night Live. 
Has an eclectic collection of Lord of the Rings merchandise, including a Gandalf for President button. 
Popularized "truthiness" after making it the Word of the Day on the debut episode of The Colbert Report; the American Dialect Society named it the Word of the Year in 2005. 
Delivered the 2006 commencement address at Illinois' Knox College, where he received an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts.  
Also in 2006, Colbert spoke at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, where his humor, aimed not only at politicians but at the media, rubbed many the wrong way. 
His bizarre, often hilarious 2007 book I Am America (And So Can You!), which he pushed shamelessly on The Colbert Report, was a bestseller. 
Four episodes of The Colbert Report were taped in 2009 in Iraq. He performed his typical, odd act there, explaining to the New York Times that, "If I tried to tailor my material to people in the Army, there’d be two things. A, that’d be patronizing. And B, I’d be wrong."Stephen Colbert Relationships: Lorna Colbert - MotherEvelyn McGee - WifeJay Colbert - BrotherMary - SisterMadeline Colbert - DaughterJohn Colbert - SonPaul Colbert - BrotherWilliam Colbert - BrotherEdward Colbert - BrotherJames Colbert - BrotherThomas Colbert - BrotherLouis Colbert - BrotherPeter Colbert - BrotherMorgan - SisterPeter Colbert - SonStephen Colbert Awards: 2011 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2007 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2013 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series - Winner2012 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety Series - Nominee2010 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Winner2013 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety Series - Winner2008 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program - Winner2009 Grammy:  Best Comedy Album - Winner2006 Emmy:  Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program - Nominee2006 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program - Winner2008 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2004 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program - Winner2005 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program - Winner2007 Emmy:  Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program - Nominee2009 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2006 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2006 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program - Nominee2008 Emmy:  Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program - Nominee2014 People's Choice Awards:  Favorite Late Night Talk Show Host - Winner2013 Grammy:  Best Spoken Word Album - Winner2009 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2010 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2007 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program - Nominee2011 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2012 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series - NomineeCollege: Attended Hampden-Sydney College, Hampden-Sydney, Virginia, United States; Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, United States (BA in Theater, 1986)

Colbert reunited with his Exit 57 cast mates to create and star in Strangers With Candy, which ran from 1998 to 2000.
In 2005, Colbert left The Daily Show to host his own comedy news show on Comedy Central, The Colbert Report.
In 2014, Colbert was announced as the successor to David Letterman as the host of The Late Show when Letterman retires in 2015.
Stephen Colbert Overview:Stephen Colbert might just be the best fake right-wing pundit in America. As host of his own comedy news show, The Colbert Report on Comedy Central, Colbert has made famous his perfectly assured (even when wrong), outspoken conservative character. Colbert's background is in improv and sketch comedy, making him incredibly quick-witted and fast on his feet. Combining absurdity with heady intellectualism, his satirical take on punditry has made him one of the country's leading political comedians. The world needs more of his brand of truthiness.Young Stephen Colbert:Stephen Tyrone Colbert was born in Washington, D.C., but grew up the youngest of 11 children in Charleston, South Carolina. At the age of 10, Colbert lost his father and two brothers in a plane crash. Raised from then on by a single mother, Colbert being to act in plays and developed a love for theater. He attended Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia to study philosophy, but transferred to Northwestern University after two years to study theater.While attending Northwestern, Colbert began to do improvisational sketch comedy at Chicago's Annoyance Theater as part of the city's famous ImprovOlympic. After graduating in 1986, Colbert took a job at the city's other famous improv comedy theater, Second City, where he eventually joined the touring company as the understudy to future Daily Show co-star Steve Carrell.The Move to TV:While at Second City, Colbert met and made friends with cast mates Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello. The three joined forces to create the sketch comedy show Exit 57, which was picked up by Comedy Central in 1995 and ran for one season on the network.
After Exit 57 was canceled, Colbert joined the writing staff and cast of ABC's short-lived sketch comedy The Dana Carvey Show, alongside Carrell, Robert Smigel and Louis C.K. Once again, the show lasted less than a season.Stephen Colbert and 'The Daily Show':In 1997, Colbert joined the cast of Comedy Central's The Daily Show. He played one of four staff "reporters" on the show, which at that time was hosted by Craig Kilborn. When Jon Stewart took over in 1999, Colbert began to take on a more prominent role. It was during these years that Colbert's "character" -- the know-it-all blowhard he would eventually take to his own series. Colbert remained on the show until 2005, once again working alongside Carrell and occasionally filling in for Stewart as anchor when needed. He won three Emmy Awards for his work on the show, in 2004, 2005 and 2006.'Strangers with Candy':In 1998, while still working on The Daily Show, Colbert reunited with his Exit 57 cast mates to co-create and co-star on the Comedy Central series Strangers with Candy. The comedy, a parody of after-school specials (on which Colbert played a closeted-gay high school teacher), ran for three seasons from 1998 to 2000. In 2006, a feature film version of the now-cult series was released to poor box office and mixed reviews.'The Colbert Report':By 2005, Colbert had become a popular enough fixture on The Daily Show to warrant his own spin-off. With The Daily Show as its lead-in, the Colbert-hosted The Colbert Report premiered in 2005 and became an instant hit. A parody of FOX News shows like The O'Reilly Factor, The Colbert Report features the comedian in full "character" mode, spouting often-nonsensical conservative dogma while actually satirizing the Right. After being nominated for three years in a row, Colbert finally took home an Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series Emmy for the Report in 2008.In 2007, Colbert published his first book, the satirical I Am America (And So Can You). It quickly reached the top of the New York Times Bestseller list.
Also in 2007, Colbert announced that he would make a bid for the 2008 presidential election in his home state of South Carolina. Within a month, his ballot application was denied.
In 2008, Colbert debuted his own Christmas special on Comedy Central: A Colbert Christmas: The Greatest Gift of All. It was released as an album in 2009, and won the 2009 Grammy Award for Outstanding Comedy Album.
In 2006, Colbert was invited to speak at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, where he delivered a now-infamous and scathing routine on President Bush and his staff -- all of whom were in attendance.
Colbert provides the voice for one half of Robert Smigel's recurring Saturday Night Live animated short, "The Ambiguously Gay Duo."
Time magazine named Colbert one of the 100 most influential people in 2006, and he was named Person of the Year at the 2007 U.S. Comedy Arts Festival.

=======================================================
Stephen Colbert is the host and executive producer of The Colbert Report, an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning series on Comedy Central. Touted by The New York Times as “one of the best television shows of the year” and praised by Entertainment Weekly as “the best show of the year,” the program has garnered ratings and critical acclaim since its 2005 launch. Before the success of his own program, Colbert was the much-beloved and longest-tenured correspondent on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. His performance career began in Chicago with the famed Second City improv troupe and has spanned sketch comedy, television drama, animated film and live-action narrative. In 2006, Colbert was named one of Time Magazine’s “100 Most Influential People.” His 2007 book, I Am America (And So Can You!), reached number one on The New York Times Best Seller List.
Born in Washington, DC and raised near Charleston, South Carolina, Colbert graduated from Northwestern University. His Irish ancestors immigrated to the U.S. throughout the 19th century. Stephen’s great-great-grandfather, Michael Garin, arrived with the massive wave triggered by Ireland’s Great Famine, but a number of his ancestors came earlier still. Colbert’s German ancestors arrived in the American colonies in the mid-18th century. The youngest of eleven children, he now lives with his wife Evelyn and their three children in the New York metropolitan area. 
I can’t wait to see the entire interview. Colbert is a comedic genius.  His Colbert Nation rules ;)!
I can never get enough of Stephen! I have a shrine in my office to him. I’m thinking of having a movie screen in my office dedicated to every clip he’s ever made.
So nice to see the REAL Stephen Colbert speaking. I was not surprised to find a more warm, sweet person than his TV persona. But I agree with Patty. I can’t get enough of Stephen.
The “real” Stephen reminds me a lot of one of my brothers, Dave.    He also is warm, incredibly intelligent, and always a joy to hear his voice.   
If we find out Stephen *is* descended from Native Americans (this is not a “spoiler alert!”, as I have no idea), all the better — from a member of the Colbert Nation since 2007.
Um is Colbert not a “natural born citizen?” Is he Obama’s lost twin? When did his family stop practicing satanic rites? Find out here.
Can you sweet PBS folks load some lower-quality clips? The video is fragmented and we have a reasonably fast Internet connection and comp. Thanks!
Colbert is a brilliant mind. He’s refreshingly hilarious and inspirational. I’m glad to be a part of the Colbert nation.
I love Stephen Colbert and Henry Louis Gates, Jr.   Very interesting interview clip — what a charming person Stephen is.  But what I have to wonder is:  if all the people who claim some Native American heritage are actually of Native American extraction, why aren’t they more generous with their people — The Native American would not have the highest poverty rate in the nation if all who claim that heritage were more supportive of them.  Think about it… how many people do you know who claim that their great great grandmother was one quarter Indian..?
This is in response to Kathy:  I too have Native American blood way back when and my grandfather was ashamed to talk about it
. We can be more supportive of Native Americans, but most Native Americans want nothing to do with all the “newfound” Natives. First, they think we are after government money, and second, to think the Native American mixed with white blood? They would rather the African American mix with their blood.
oh, forgot to comment on Tim’s comment.  Unless they fixed the glitch with the video, my video looks perfect, and I don’t have the greatest connection speed or the newest computer. Maybe you need to update some of your applications.
I love this chance to see real Stephen! He seems like such a real and loveable person, and those who call him family and a friend must be lucky to do so. I can’t wait to see this show.
My parents have done our genealogy for years – we found (and met!) our family in Lithuania when we weren’t even sure of the placename.  If Stephen is really interested, he might be amazed at what else he can find out. Interestingly enough, we had a rumor about Native Americans in our line, too – nope, just North Carolina German immigrants & lots of ‘em.  Looks like a fascinating show – can’t wait to see it!
There was the Native American or Aboriginal People rumor in our family, DNA testing proved 14% with 1% East Asian.. It was fun but pricey to find out. We are all related.
High-Larious.  Loved his book, love his shtick.  And how refreshing to hear someone tell the story of their mythical Indian heritage, “but there’s no proof of that”.   My mother used to quip that if we believed everyone who claimed their “great-great-grandmother was an Indian princess”, there must have been no Indian men five generations back.  Actually, Colbert’s father’s family’s roots are all around my reservation, so it wouldn’t surprise me if he really did have some Indian blood.  The youngest of 11?  Sounds Indian to me.  That and his self-deprecating humor.  And to answer that earlier poster’s comment about not wanting to claim Wannabes because of government money?   That smacks of the old racist claim that we don’t pay taxes but live off the dole.    We tend to recognize Indian blood when it’s present, and it has nothing to do with skin color.  FBIs (Full-Blooded Indians) come in all different hues, so that’s not the tie that binds us.  Being Indian is being tribal, first of all, and having a common ancestry that was never denied.  We have much in common, but it’s not always something that can easily be described like high cheekbones, straight black hair, or the genetic tendency towards alcoholism.   Anyway, Colbert rules.  Would that he would run for Prez . . . .
This is to Barbara who claims that native people would rather be mixed with black Americans than white.  I’m not sure where that generalization comes from but it is illogical and certainly not a reflection of reality.  Mixed black natives are treated much more poorly (by fbi’s) in general than mixed bloods with white ancestry.  Most prominent Indians(Peter Pytchlynn, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Cobell) do have substantial white blood and that is considered “normal.” These are the people who are admired and respected, for whatever reason…survival or otherwise.  Black blood has historically come in at the bottom of the totem pole on the North American continent and while I personally  love being both African and Choctaw there are plenty of natives who have made it clear that they consider me less than.
I work on TCR.  Stephen is great, but let’s not forget his writing team. They are a very talented bunch of people. The entire staff and crew are the best in the biz! I can’t believe I get paid for having fun!
For years I have enjoyed Colbert. He is truly charming, amazing, brilliant, hysterically funny and poignant all at once. True creativity and intelligence rolled into one person. You can see the love of a family coming through. family is everything. Someone like this may never have come to be without the support of a family. to be an artist take a tremendous amount of strength. Very few can recognize that goal without knowing that no matter how far out on that limb they go, there is laways family at arms length to catch and support them. I am not saying he had it easy – even though he does but the truth of the matter is when you do have a support system you can take chances and know deep inside you can always flop on a couch somewhere or get a meal somewhere if you are going through tough times. He is brilliant and has made the most of the opportunities he was afforded. This is a testament to him and to the strength of his family. If only he would run for President for real. Keep going please, you and mr. Stewart are the only things keeping television alive and well (of course PBS).
Wasnt funny and I felt cheated. The part about the baby Jesus…full of it…I wouldnt make a shrine but I would pray for him…
He is ultimately “French.” The Normans of Normandy France invaded Ireland in 1169. They were  pretty well assimilated into the Irish population by the 14th century, but you can tell their descendents by their surnames – Colbert, Barrett, Palmer, Stapleton, etc. Stephen pronounces it in the French manner affectatiously for the most part, because French sounds more posh.
There are other comics who people are fans of and who are admired greatly, but Stephen is set apart in that people LOVE him. He’s probably one of the most beloved people in America.
My grandmother Eugenia MacDonough McEvoy emigrated  from Roscommon, Ireland in late 1880s. They were bound for Boston and sea storms redirected the boat to two port only to be turned away. Savannah, Ga. accepted them and I have grown up with stories of poverty, abandonment and classmate  Flannery O’Connor, neighbor Johnny Mercer and others less well known. A friend and I traveled to Ireland in 2000 and I found it almost mystical. A Roscommon hotel bartender drank a toast to us,the McEvoy and Macdonough clans over a glass of Jameson whiskey. I ,too, was raised with the wakes of my Irish grandmother, aunts and uncle. A strange alienation endured amongst them, with great geographic distances and in communication with one another. All have passed away and now a few cousins have made the effort to stay in communication with one another. Most are still in the southern US.
I like Stephen Colbert……..but maybe he will be able to  find out where that “gleepy” right ear of his came from!!
Honestly, I’m getting tired of the shtick, unless it’s reruns of the White House Correspondent’s dinner.
Stephen Colbert is the man.  He eclipsed John Stewart on Comedy Central and I was a Daily Show fan before Stewart was even on it.  Why does he have a fanatical following?  It’s there because he is just that good.  His comedy and nature is an inspiration.  With committed fans he’s raised money for charity, successfully helped sponsor the speed skating team, and does all of this while keeping his fans laughing.  I’m always amazed at the people who he’ll have on his show that just don’t get it.  You can tell that there are people that think he’s going to conduct a serious interview whether its on the set or out in the field, and many of these were Congressmen during the days of “Better Know A District.”  They don’t realize that the joke is on them and that makes it all the better.  Does real content get discussed on the show.  Yes.  Is there always humor there as well.  Definitely.

To Jack:  I must personally say “thank you” then to you and all the team at TCR.  One of the “secrets” to success is to love what you do and have an incredibly cohesive environment as TCR so obviously has.  Congratulations on well-deserved success!  Keep it coming, please . . . .
I agree — the writers on TCR are fantastic!  My husband and I were just discussing how amazingly funny both The Daily Show and TCR are, night after night, whereas Saturday Night Live — with a huge cast and I’m sure a writing staff to match — has gotten to be SO lame!  May you continue having fun for many years to come!
It’s so interesting to hear and see him out of his show character. Seems odd to hear him speak of family tradition as well as his true history in whole with regards to the bits and pieces he throws in during interviews on the Report. Now he’s got me wondering more of my own Irish ancestry.
It is also revealing the USA as it truly is- an everchanging melting pot of races from around the world. I believe that if more people realized what their ancestors faced when they arrived on these shores they would be more supportive and acceptive of the poor, tired and hungry that cross our borders.
Stephen Colbert is my father’s first cousin. My Grandmother and his Mother are sisters. It is great to see him having so much success in his life. My father and my brother will be watching tonight to see what is mentioned about our side of the family. I will have to watch the episode on the PBS site tomorrow because I don’t get this PBS unfortunately. I would just like to say to Stephen that his family in Vermont speaks of him often and we are very proud to be a part of his family tree.
He amazes me, every time I see his show I like him more,and his intellect and humor make him very very sexy.
I have just finished howling with laughter.  As Dr. Gates opened the segment about the English oppression of the Irish I turned to my wife and said, “Those English could be real bastards.”  Then Colbert asked, “Can I say something about that?”  The truth is they really are bastards.
I am of Irish descent on my mother’s side of the family, as is Stephen Colbert.  Many of the names Stephen mentioned regarding his mother’s ancestry have appeared during our ancestrial search.  My late father’s family is English and German, and several of the names Stephen mentioned regarding his wife’s ancestry have appeared in our search from that side of the family.   What we have verifiably uncovered this far is a confirmed relationship to British and Scottish aristocracy, as well as former Irish aristocracy who were driven from their land.  It would be a hilarious situation if we found out that our family was related to Stephen’s wife on once side, and to Stephen on the Irish side.  This series is very well done and I have enjoyed the segment on Stephen Colbert.  At this point, I am very tempted to contact Doctor Gates and have him and his staff delve into our ancestry, as the sources we have utilized have been limited as to how much information we can obtained from either side of our family.
That’s pretty fantastic that you and your family get to learn more about your ancestors as well on the show. Exciting!
Ok, so is the mythical Native American princess story exclusive to us Southerners, or do those of you with long lines in other US regions have that myth, too?    I remember my mother telling me that one, and me thinking, “Yeah, right. Tell me another one.” 
Would love to see Gates do a companion show about how they did the research.  He makes it look so easy, and anyone who does genealogy knows it is not easy at all to find those primary sources and documents.   It’s especially difficult when you starting digging through documents in a different language or have to decipher unusual naming customs.    Sure, there are a lot of on-line databases, but they often have MANY errors that keep getting repeated by people who don’t want to verify the data.  Even some primary sources have errors.  My grandmother’s death certificate lists her daughter as her mother!
THANK You, PBS,Thank YOU, Mr. Gates, and THANK YOU, Stephen…Stephen, your story has made me both recognize myself  and laugh…I had not realized that my feelings towards the English were indeed part of being Irish in America…The only negative story told was by my paternal grandmother-who though born in England, was indeed Irish…She told of while a young elementary student in Liverpool, when hearing God Save the Queen (?) in school, both she and her sister would turn their backs (in protest)…And, I do share personally that when I initially found that my husband’s ancestors were from Northern Ireland, I was delighted…THEN, many years after our marriage when I found out they were Scotch-Irish-I would tease “your family were tools of the English, used to oppress my people.”  Again, THANK YOU to all who created this series and shared their story.
I’m not just a Colbert National, I’m a long-lost cousin !!!  Michael Garin was my great-grandfather, and lived in Veroqua, Wisconsin.  There are Garins in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, St. Louis and I’m the lone Californian.  If we’re not related to the same Michael Garin, we’re related to someone who is !!!
Stephen – learning about your Irish roots was an unexpected surprise. I left wanting to know more. FACES of AMERICA did a great job digging. Loved the article about the British goods. I’m biased – my Dad is from the same area around Tyrone – an Irish Catholic who was treated like a second-class citizen back just back in the 30s. That’s why he flew to freedom here.
There are a couple of things Stephen should know though.  The reference to “Went West” on the Irish tombstones concerns the old Irish belief that the dead travel to the after world by traveling over the western sea from Ireland to the Western Land.  “Went West” means that the deceased has gone to heaven.
Also, the discussion about the transporting of the Irish to Canada in returning ships is even crasser than Stephen thought.  Ireland did receive imports from Canada but had little going back.  You can’t sail a transport ship with nothing in the hold.  The ship would ride too high, would be top heavy, and subject to capsizing.  Captains used to buy tons of ballast stones in Ireland for the return trip.  Starving Irish men and women leaving their homes were free   The captain didn’t have to buy ballast. The Irish men, women, and children came free (or may have had their passage paid for). A win-win for the ship owner.  
Finally, the reason why Ireland was a net food exporting nation was that the farm rents were paid in food (wheat, oats, barley, butter etc.). None of these were affected by the potato blight.  All the time they were starving, the Irish were growing food they weren’t allowed to eat so they could pay their rent.  If they didn’t, they were evicted from their farms (or had there homes torn down on top of them) and their farms turned into sheep grazing meadows. The free market in operation.
(See: The Western Land: Afterlife Beliefs In Ancient Irish Paganism by James Bonwick; The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-1849 by Cecil Woodham-Smith; The Famine Ships: The Irish Exodus to America, 1846-51by Edward Laxton; and The Damnable Question : A Study in Anglo-Irish Relations by George Dangerfield) 
Stephen Colbert and the genealogy thereof?! Funny in and of itself! He knows who we all come from…Adam and Eve, of course…end of discussion! lol
Stephen is just truly sublime. What a beautiful, warm, engaging man he is! I’m actually English and went over to America last November to see him & when I met him he was very kind, generous & gracious towards me, so hopefully he doesn’t still ‘hate the English’!!! LOL!!! Noticed his great grandmother was Judy Dunn, wonder if he’s related to my ex partner who is a Dunn. Heck, we could’ve almost been related my marriage! Oh, how I wish!!!
Stephen, please come to the UK and let us soothe those raw wounds, you are very loved over here (certainly by me!!!)
Stephen, aside from the fact you (col)bert a strong resemblance to my oncologist, Dr David August (CINJ…New Brunswick)…I’ve loved you from the git go.  Totally adored your benefit for the Two Rivers Theatre in Red Bank.  If I have survived living in these US of A’s …it is because you kept me “sane”.  Thanks…merci beaucoup!
Welcome to the Leatherman Clan. As a geneologist of this Early American Family line, I almost fell out of my chair when the good Dr. showed your connection to Hans Diebold Ledermann.  We would probably be about 5th cousins. I knew there was something about you I liked. If you want to look at some of the Leathermans and look at the notes on them, go to Ancestry.com and find my “LEATHERMAN LINE” tree. Thirty-five years of work BEFORE the advent of the internet plus what our cousins today have added. A proud and honored line.
One thing Stephen Colbert and I have in common are my ancestors immigrated to Canada from Alsace Lorraine, Germany in the 1800’s.  They grew tired of the fighting back and forth between Germany and France so they moved to Port Colbourne Ontario in Canada and became wealthy German farmers.  Beiderman were their names and they were protesants too(Lithuaniun).
I too have the Alsace Lorraine territory in common with Stephen.  I got so excited when they started mentioning that area!  My ancestor (Reinhardt Laubach) emmigrated to Pennsylvania in the 1600’s.  Perhaps our families knew each other?  what a wonderful thought.  I really am enjoying the series so far.  What i wouldnt give for Dr. Gates to delve into my family tree (its hard work!)
Interesting. Stephen’s story about his fathers side of his family sounds mirror to my mother’s side of my family. She was a Colbert who migrated West from Oklahoma during the dust bowl. My Grandfather, Robert Colbert, never admitted his Indian heritage until near the end of his life. For years this had been a huge family secret and is a direct result of President Andrew Jackson’s Indian Removal act. From early on, a few Colbert ancestors intermarried with native tribes (Chickasaw and Choctaw). Many subsequently became wealthy landowners. As time went on, land-hungry all white settlers wanted this land. Mixed-race people who looked too Native American lost their land with little or no compensation — hence “the secret.” I’ve done quite a bit of research on “Colbert.” As far as I can tell, the line may originate from Vikings who settled parts of Scotland and Ireland in the 9th century. A few went to early France as mercenaries. My Colbert Ancestor arrived in Virginia around 1640-1650.
I was really surprised tonight to find out that someone had attached this information to my family tree on Ancestry.com.. I am also a descendent of Hans Diebold Lederman (Leatherman) on my dad’s side. It is really amazing the things that I have learned in researching my family tree on my mother’s and dads side as well as on my husbands side of the family. The biggest surprise I found was to find that my husband and I share a set of ever so great grandparents thereby making my husband and me eighth cousins one time removed on our mothers side.
Taking Tuns of Food to England and STARVING the Irish and multplying this by all the Countries in the British Empire England will never be forgiven and the Orange Order of Freemasons in N. Ireland who have Straved Catholick for 800 years and Controle America Look inside Washington Monument and see who Built it and Look at the Orange Order Of Freemasons marchong season in America at the Saint Patricks Day Parade where the Orange Order of Shriners have be in for years in America.
If you want to see Anger in America and the violation of Free Speech as the question about Freemasons in Parade, Have a Camera redy to record the ANGER and your Arrest by Freemason Police
Crazy, but I have an ancestor that came from the same village in Alsace, and also ended up settling in the same part of Pennsylvania. Really cool to know that my ancestors were neighbors to his ancestors!
I found the research of Mr. Colbert’s Irish roots by Mr. Gates extremely interesting. My Murphy family came from Cork via the ballast lumber ships that returned to St. John, New Brunswick. This is the first time I have heard of any records regarding the empty lumber boat migrations. Wonderful series. Thank you for sharing.
As a practicing Lutheran I resent the inclusion of Colbert’s comment calling Lutherans “heretics”.
I wouldn’t presume to instruct Colbert or any of us Claire regarding where we come from.   Your statement is pure opinion.
Nine tenths of my ancestry is Colonial English and I’m as proud of it as you are of your Irish roots.
“Those English could be real bastards.” Then Colbert asked, “Can I say something about that?” The truth is they really are bastards.”
I’m nearly 100% English by heritage with a bit of Scots-Irish thrown in.   I resent you calling my ancestors bastards as much as you’d resent several choice words I could use to describe your Irish background.
Thank you so much for your note,about the irish starving,and the English tranporting their food out of the country.This happening does not appear often,since much of Irish history is written by the Englsh.On  St Patricks day every year,I tell my grandchildren a story about Irish History.This year I will tell them this one.My mother,who was born in County Clare in 1903,often told storiesabout the potato famine,and how the english robbed them of food,andwatched them starve to death.I WILL TRY TO BUY THE BOOK YOU MENTIONED,AND READMORE ABOUT THIS TERRIBLE TIME.THanks again Betty b
Nice comments. Alas I see no “John Tuck” that i recall hearing briefly in the program. I was curious to hear about this line for (semi)obvious reasons, given the frequency of surname variants. I would be quite happy to share a relation with Dr. Stephen Colbert D.F.A.
Wow, Stephen being serious. It took me so long to figure it out, then I realized this was PBS. So I had to review the clips all over again. 
I’m curious why Gates has yet to research Colbert’s own surname.   It is French.  I’d be interested to know if is Acadian or European French in origin.
Do you suppose it has its roots in the Norman Conquest of 1066.   Much like the Irish surname Devereaux it appears like it may well.
I’m also Lutheran, but as a regular watcher of  “The Colbert Report” I recognize that statement as a joke. Stephen Colbert’s alter-ego on his show is this hyper-patriotic, conservative, ultra-Catholic guy who would make statements like –Protestants are going to Hell for their apostasy– etc, but it’s all in jest.  You should check out his statements at the Emmy’s  where he denounced the Hollywood audience as,” Godless Sodomites.” His humor may not be for everyone, but for the it-getters, he’s hilarious..
It was interesting to watch and learn that Stephen and my husband are distant cousins.  They both share a common ancestor, Hans Peter Ledermann born in 1711.  It really is true that we are all connected.  Stephen, how about coming to our 4th of July party.  Doesnt get more American then that?
Touchy!  I think Claire was joking along the lines of what Colbert the character would say.  After all he mentions time and again how the world is only 6,000 years old and so forth.  I think he would appreciate Clair’s homage.  Hey, Tosatel, George Bush: Great President or Greatest President?
Tosatel, you seem very uncomfertable with the Irish people’s opinion of the English.  I can understand that but being mostly Irish myself it seems as though there is something you are not understanding about the Irish.  It doesn’t matter how many years it has been (and honestly the fighting does continue to this day) the Irish are not likely to stop having hard feelings over the extreme injustices that occurred.  Also, as Americans most people (excluding perhaps the decendants of tories) have reason to think of the English in a less than kind light.  Recall the old motto “The Sun Never Sets on the British Empire”?  Well, much of the world has experianced the English under less that happy circumstances.  You would think that being mostly English plus Scots-Irish plus American you would have an appreciation for the feelings of oppressed people.  After all who has oppressed as many people as the English?  I would wager America is a pretty close second.
Toasted:  I’m both Irish and English.  Ken didn’t give you a personal insult , but history is  history.  And, it wasn’t so much the everyday Brit – but the powers that were – not only let millions of Irish starve and be forced to flee their homeland.  And the American government never supported the Irish, which I could never understand due to the amazing amount of Irish in America.  What the British did to the Irish was never really dealt with in American history books.  They didn’t just stand by and watch as people starved to death, but they denied them the right to fish – and they actually took food & livestock out of Ireland under the guard of the British army.  The in addition to the starvation and diaspora, the Brits outlawed the Irish language and were physically and mentally abusive to the Irish.  There’ s really no other way to say it other than how Colbert & Ken said it – good governments don’t occupy foreign countries and abusive the citizens of those countries.  And it’s 600 yrs and counting.
PS – I don’t know Ken and didnt’ come on here to defend him or accuse the British.  Just to find out more about the wonderful and talented Colbert and his Irish roots.
Why you ask my opinion of George Bush (which one do you mean?) is beyond me.   But since you’ve asked I think the most recent one didn’t have the intelligence to come out of the wet weather.   Just because someone has generational American heritage neither makes them better or worse or more intelligent of more culpable than ANYONE else.  
He said at one point during the interview (paraphrase)  “I grew up knowing I was from the best America had to offer.  We were middle class,  we were Roman Catholic,  and we were Irish.   HUH?
And beyond that the treatment of the Irish by SOME “Brits” isn’t the topic of this thread.   We’re talking about these United States.
Your desription of what the Irish went through was not exclusive to them.   The Scottish were similarly treated centuries before.  But the bottom line here is were it not for the “Brits” (read English) which you seem so quick to vilify we’d not have our foundational governing principles.   Recall –  those loosely called “The Founding Fathers”  did much to allow you and me to enjoy the privileges we do in this land.  And those men were pretty much entirely English by ancestry.
Take a good hard look at what’s going on for in-fighting in Iraq between the Shiites and the Sunnis and you’ll get a rough idea that the phenomenon you describe above is not exclusive to any one nationality.  Invariably it’s based in the “my God it better than you God” theory.    And it’s preposterous.
Stephen gave me a flash of memory. Our family used to put pieces of straw in the manger of the baby Jesus during advent. One piece each day for each of us kids then my little brother, the youngest, put the baby in the manger on Christmas Eve. My brother is gone now and I have not thought of that for over 30 years. That tradition would have come from my German side of the family. Thanks Stephen for that memory of my brother and our family all together.
I descend from the other ‘negroes’ of north armerica the Irish and the French. Take your pick – both have been called that at some point in history.  As for my Irish twig of my tree,  I do remember reading that post  the summer of ‘48, some member of the English government  were dumbstruck that potatoes had been planted in Eire once again, over other some other crop. Can anyone shed light on why potatoes were chosen a second time?  Needless to say, the Brits did not see the Irish as willing to help themselves in this particular reference. (Now don’t be shooting the messenger! I am far enough removed to be able to want see both angles of their conflict.)
I never saw this series (Malcolm Gladwell? Really?) , but I remember Mr. Colbert making reference to having a Canadian great-grandfather during his “Canadians are ice-holes” segments vis-a-vis the Olympics, thereby giving him liscence to poke fun at the Canucks.
Which of course is legitimate, it’s what we do best! LOL!  But he has a secret weapon-two of his staffers are Canadians. Which explains why his jokes are right on the(CrappyTire)  money!  He always looked Black Irish to me-I know, I know, takes one to know one!
After getting the results back from the cheek swab test kit through Ancestry.com, I’m proud to say that I share an ancient ancestor with Stephen—we belong to the mitochondrial DNA group- Haplogroup K.
We both descend from the “Ice Immigrants” who were first hunter gatherers, but our most recent common ancestor, is the 5,300 year old man who was discovered in the snowy Alps near the Austrian-Italian border in 1991.   Scientists named him Otzi.
Luther was a “heretic” as it is defined as “a dissenter from established church dogma”.  The established Church of Luther’s time was the Roman Catholic Church and its dogma.  Colbert’s winks at this history.
Well, I’m sure the Lutheran connection was surprising to him. I admire anyone who went on this show – they were all risking a big jolt to their cherished ideas about themselves and the stories passed down through the family.
Over a quarter of Irish names are Norman and English e.g. many of the names starting with D like Darcy and Delaney as well as Burke (de Burgo), Joyce and all the Fitz names except Fitzpatrick. Our most famous slain patriot, Patrick Pearse, had an English father and our longest serving Prime Minister, Eamon De Valera, had a Spanish-American father. Many of our greatest writers were of English origin – Swift, Yeats, Beckett, Shaw, Wilde. Edmund Burke was of mixed origin but let’s be clear that Arthur Guinness became Protestant purely for convenience. Scots-Irish are ethnically Lowland Scots to a large extent.  
I’m afraid I know Lutherans only from Garrison Keillor, one charming colleague and some German-American relatives by marriage who take a very dim view of us Catholics and our Popish cult and even made our relative change teams. One of their number insists that nearly everything thought to be Irish is in fact German, even Danny Boy. I wish The Londonderry Air HAD been written by a German – the fact that an Englishman came up with the words (but not the music) is even worse, after all – but all our efforts have failed on this front. Why the member of a tribe that produced Bach, Beethoven etc. etc. and, in Germany and America, much of the world’s technological advances, would want to claim another country’s little folk song is beyond me. And I know there is at least an equal number of Irish Catholic eejits too. BTW was that perfectly odious German-American cartoonist Nast a Lutheran or Reformed or something else?
I forgot St. Patrick – a Briton – and one of our greatest heroes of recent years, Jackie Charlton – English, i’m afraid.
That fight across the Rhine was going on when my Leathermans (Ledermann) decided to come to America in 1718. A combination of religious persecution, the Germans sending Swedish mercenaries to burn them out and the “little ice age” that devistated Europe at that time. The Germans that came to both Canada and America played a major role in settling both countries, teaching the good old German work ethic and providing a basic moral base both countries accepted for generations.
Wow! Wow! Thanks for this piece of information. You know I watched the show & when he talked about the man who was making a business out of shipping out poor people, I thought, pure capitalism would celebrate this. It would be considered innovative, entrepreneurial, i.e., American. Free-market indeed…And I think today, we are asking: “where do we draw the line?”. There has to be a line otherwise people are going suffer for it & we’ll end up a nation as we say in French: “sans scrupules”, without regards for the poor, the disaffected when some of our ancestors were just that. 
I could see how upset Stephen was when it was all described to him during the show.  And this happened 350 years ago…and after the Irish assimilated into the culture & after he married a woman descendant of the English! And for Native Americans, oppression had happened even earlier but still the wounds are there. So it’s almost unrealistic to say that African-Americans should “get over” racial injustices overcome only less than 50 years by the legal system. That’s too recent of a history; I mean our grandparents who lived through that are still alive. There’s been progress & we should celebrate that & ALL strive to deal with the wounds in a healthy way but to expect a people not to remember & “move on”, that’s just not realistic.  It’s what we hope for & work towards in good faith but “time heals wounds” eventually…
I see you are Choctaw.  My family is from south Missouri and Louisiana.  We have documented our Choctaw genealogy but I’m always sad that when I visit the family homeplace area in N. Louisiana, I can’t find out where the Choctaw were displaced? 
 My mother was dark haired, blued slanted eyes and very high cheekbones…she also had larger lips than others of her era (which caused some unappreciated comments from her peers).  She was truly beautiful as her white and Indian heritage worked so well together .  She always supported the Indian causes and was very sensitive to their continuing cruel treatment.
Potatoes were planted again because they were the only economically viable crop available to the Irish farmers. They had small plots on poor land and potatoes were the only crop which could feed their families under such circumstances. Perhaps the members of the British government were dumbfounded because they thought the Irish had a legitimate choice with respect to crop planting. Or, more likely, they were seeking to exculpate themselves from their responsibility for establishing economic conditions under which 1 million people died of starvation.
Jackie Charlton is no great Irish hero. The players were. Roy Keane, Paul McGrath, and Ray Houghton in particular. Come On You Boys in Green!
Your apologist routine for the British Empire is tiresome. Claiming colonial oppression isn’t exclusive to Anglo-Irish history does not mitigate the dismal British record in Ireland n any way.
Wow! English resentment towards the Irish. I can really empathize with your deep sense of historical grievance.
Tosatel is nearly 100% something, however, as a gentleman, I’ll refrain from it’s name. The Brits have never stopped being a class based society. To this day there is an ingrained class prejudice that would account for their checkered history of pomp and circumstance of bastadness.
I too share the same Maternal DNA (mtDNA) as Steven Colbert, so that means we have a common grandmother. I just don’t know which one it is.  We’re Haplogroup K1, btw.
I can’t make the link work to see Steven here.  I did see the PBS show the night it came on Summer 2010.
Does anybody know where one can actually view the “tree” of Mr. Colbert?  One that shows who whi grandmothers family was.
I thought I heard Louis Gates tell him his maternal side was French Hugunots. Is that right?  I’ve also read that us K1’s came from the area around the border between France and Germany and the German Palatinate
An excellent series, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this when it was on. Of course, all the stories were fascinating, but I loved Stephen’s-big fan of him, was fun to hear a bit about his history. I have German (mostly German), French, and Irish ancestry, and my family came from Alsace Lorraine, too, as I’ve heard it, so I’m curious to see if there’s any connection there, too. If I ever get to delve deeper into my ancestry (and I’d love to have Prof. Gates do it, he seems to know just where to look), I’d be interested to see the results. 
I love his character, he’s brilliant at it, but I agree, it’s always fun to see him out of that role, when he’s just his normal, everyday self. He seems like an incredibly intelligent, sweet, down-to-earth guy, and I admire that. It’s refreshing to see there’s public figures with those traits still out there.
(Also, I was raised Lutheran and laughed at his “swipes” at the faith. Me thinks some people might want to lighten up a little bit)
This is the common sentiment of all of Brits not English…Ive met Scottish/Welsh and Irish…always the same.
The discovery, by Bryan Sykes, professor of human genetics at Oxford University, will herald a change in scientific understanding of Britishness.

Tosatel, it’s been awhile!  Just had to comment about your comment: “If it was a joke… I didn’t find it amusing.”  It puts a smile on my face.  Let’s face it, you don’t seem to find any of this amusing.  Which is why it amazes me that you continue to bother.  When I go on a message board and am in general disagreement with what everyone is saying, I might leave one message just to put a counter opinion out there but otherwise I just stop reading if it offends me.  From what you continue to say just about everything offends you.  So, why stay?  Let us have our fun and ignore it.
Tosatel- Not my mistake but yours “my dear”.  First of all, you really thought Clair was “proselythizing”?  I guess you must feel people are very easily converted… it only takes two sentences.  Second, now I know for a fact that there is no way you are understanding the satire of Colbert and I have a feeling you might hate him if you understood that HE MEANS THE OPPOSITE OF EVERYTHING HE SAYS!  I’m serious now, Colbert does not think that republicans are great or that bears are Godless killing machines (well, maybe that one).  Anyway, it doesn’t matter as you outed yourself as a non-Colbert Nation member by asking about Bush.   For years Colbert asked the question that I asked you of his guests… It was a joke.  I know, I know, you don’t “see” humor much like Colbert doesn’t see race.  I will pray for a cure.

Hello,  the English as we know them today are roman descendant.  They come from Italia because of Julius Cesar.  They believe in creation.  They used to spy other nations in order to destroy their society and get the best things out of it.  This is why people do not like them.  People suspected Jack the Ripper was the Queen’s doctor.  They wrote books and created universities with all the knowledge they cumulated over time.  I am not sure but I think universities were created to train the advisors of all kings of the world in order to do what the Vatican wanted them to do.  The real kingdom is the vatican.  In fact the popes were telling other kings with kingdom to attack and recognise or not the new comming king wether or not this new king was from their society.
I think Louis XIV had italian origins.  I do not know where in this line italians appeared but for sure it is not purely french.  He sent the french to wars that were lost in advance.
Renaissance was the renaissance of the Italian art, nation etc.  When a change of period occured, there was also a change in politics.  Art is the reflexion of the tastes, of the discoveries and thechnology and tools used at a certain period of time.  Under Louis XIV there was a big change in the style of the furniture.  Wich companies were dealing with the king at that time and how they change over time.. . I am very curius to know.
Hello,  I do not think knowing your origins with genetic tools is a good way to find out as you know that first of all it can creates distances between peoples and it reminds me that some religius community whant to be pure and distinguish them selves officially with genetic.  I think it is a first step before going to war with official listings.
In the television programm, I did not heard properly were all the food was going during the starvation period.  What was France and Spain doing in that story?  Where was all the food going?
Also, I did not understood properly if this desease was created by the British to get the catholic Irish off their land or was the starvation a good occasion to send them away.

Would love to know your NC German surnames, Stephanie.  When researching my daughter’s NC paternal side, I was surprised to find that around a quarter were German who came to NC from PA.  Had always envisioned the Carolinas as being mainly Scottish-Irish.
I like the suggestion of a companion show detailing the research; and you are exactly right about the difficulty of primary research and about the MANY on-line errors that proliferate because people who don’t take the time to research for themselves just incorporate the errors into their own family trees.
My Iowan grandfather, whose roots go back to Jamestowne and the first planters in MD, as well as Rhode Island, New Jersey and Long Island in the 1620s-30s, also had an Native American princess story.   Around 1910, his mother told him and several of his siblings  that they had a native American ancestress on her side; with the caveat that they were never to tell their father, because he “hated Indians”.
I have no idea where he developed this prejudice, as his maternal uncle returned from the Civil War to move to Montana, where he became an extremely successful businessman in Ft. Benton.  There, he married a woman who belonged to the Blackfoot Indian Tribe through her mother, so my great-grandfather’s cousins were one-quarter Blackfoot.
My grandfather stated that he had seen a picture of his Native American ancestress when visiting relatives in Idaho, on his mothers side.   I’ve thought about having the DNA testing and am very curious about which line the Native American line would have entered on.  My great-grandmother did have several lines from NC who migrated to Iowa; and I’ve wondered if the Native line might have come from the East Coast, rather than the Iowa or Sioux tribes that my grandfather had always surmised.
The stories of mankind’s migration throughout the world and throughout this country are amazing; and I’m continually awed at the unbelievable routes our ancestors traveled to come together, from which we have life.
I’ve documented your Parker Family Tree site, as I also have a Parker line.  The family tradition is that it is through Captain John Parker of Lexington/Concord, but that is as yet unverified.  I’m gradually researching the various Parker lines.
A David Crockett was indeed captain of the “James Goodwill” in 1727, but it wasn’t the famed David “Davy” Crockett, who was born in 1786 in eastern Tennessee.  The Crocketagne/Crockett family history is fascinating, from the 1600s in France, where Desaure Antoine Louis De Crocketagne served “as second in command of the Household Guards” of Louis XIV.  de Crocketagne and his wife, Louise de Saix, fled France with their eldest child to avoid prosecution of the protestant Huguenot s, settling in Ireland, where their other children were born.  
It has been several years since I read the Crockett history, but their name was changed to protect the family from detection by the French.  If I remember correctly, members of the family also lived in England, prior to Davy’s ancestor emigrating to America.  Joseph Louis Crocketagne and his wife brought their eldest children from Ireland to VA ca 1708.  Davy’s great-grandfather, William D. Crockett, is listed as having been a slave trader.  
It may well be that the Captain David Crockett who brought the Palatines from Rotterdam to Philadelphia in 1727 was the son of one of the other three Crockett sons of Antoine and Louise de Crocketagne.  It’s an interesting family..
Sadly, one of the main reasons for the potato famine was that the Irish switched from many varieties of potatoes to one variety, the “lumper”, which yielded more per acre that other varieties.  It was said that an acre of potatoes provided enough calories that a family could survive, along with the milk from one cow. 
Scientists and farmers now know that genetic variation protects against loss of entire crops by pests, disease, and variations in the weather.  The Irish had grown a variety of potatoes for over 200 years, when the potato was introduced from South America; but the poor in Ireland had begun to rely on just potatoes, and on just the “lumper” variety, along with one other, called the “cup”.   The “lumper” was a wet potato that was not resistant to disease, and when a fungus was accidently brought to Ireland from North America and the weather turned warm and wet, the fungus thrived and the potato crop rotted in the field.
However, not all of the potato crop was destroyed, and the records state that most people made it though the winter.  In the spring of 1846, the remaining potatoes appeared to be good, so the farmers planted them.  Because they harbored a dormant strain of the fungus, the whole crop failed once the rains came.
The records also state that there was plenty of food grown for export to England that year, but it was more expensive that the impoverished Irish could afford.  They sold off everything not nailed down to buy food, including their tools.  They ate the food that had been grown to pay the rent, so they were evicted by their landlords.  When spring of 1847 arrived, they had no tools, no land and nothing to plant.  During the famine years, around 1 Million died, and 1 Million emigrated  to England, America, Canada and other countries. The population by the 20th century was approx. 4 Million, or half of the number of Irish population before the famine years.

Sharon, there were quite a few Quakers that left PA for NC during the 1700s during the colonial period.   The area around Hillsborough, NC might be worth a look.
Thanks  for another informative site. Where else may I am getting that kind of info written in such a perfect approach? I have a venture that I am simply now operating on, and I’ve been on the look out for such info.
And after viewing your article ” Stephen Colbert | Faces of America  | PBS “, I once and for all chose to save it on Digg. This is definitely a very good info to contribute with my friends
you are really a good webmaster. The web site loading speed is amazing. It seems that you are doing any unique trick. Moreover, The contents are masterwork. you’ve done a fantastic job on this topic!
`Colbert seems to know about as much about his ancestors as I do mine.  I don’t know why people who were born in the early part of the twenth century and before just didn’t talk much about their parents, grandparents or great grandparents.  All I was told about my grand parents on Dads side of the family is that great grandfather came from Germany and that he married a lady by the name of Duffy here.  On Moms side I know she was welch with fifty percent Hebrew in her.  I would like some day to dug into my ancestory tree.  I have third cousins in Germany on Dads side, but Moms family has been over here much longer and relatives would be much more distant.
Each time I hear Stephen Colbert speak, I’m more impressed than I was the previous time.  Good Man.  Good Show.

Comedian Stephen Colbert was born in 1964 in South Carolina and studied philosophy at the all-men's private liberal arts school Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia. Moving to Chicago to study theater at Northwestern, he got involved at Second City, where he met fellow comedians Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello. The three of them moved to New York to create the sketch comedy show Exit 57, originally aired on Comedy Central. As a writer for The Dana Carvey Show, Colbert got the chance to write for Saturday Night Live for several seasons. While working on SNL, he met up with animator Robert Smigel and provided voices for TV Funhouse's "The Ambiguously Gay Duo" (along with the voice of Steve Carrell). Colbert has also provided voices on the puppet show Crank Yankers and the Cartoon Network series Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law. Colbert is probably best known as a senior correspondent for The Daily Show on Comedy Central. He joined the show in 1997 when Craig Kilborn was still the host and held on when Jon Stewart took over in 1999. That same year, Colbert teamed with Sedaris and Dinello to create Strangers With Candy, an after-school special parody of sorts on Comedy Central. Meanwhile, Colbert's schtick on the Daily Show became more and more relevant, as the political climate in the United States became increasingly polarized following 9/11. His satyrical take on uber-right-wing TV news journalists proved so incisive and hilarious that in 2005, he parlayed it into a spin-off comedy news show of his own, the immensely popular The Colbert Report. Colbert would continue with the show for years, tweaking the format to fit the ongoing political culture. ~ Andrea LeVasseur, Rovi

=======================================================
Stephen Colbert served as a correspondent from 1997 to 2005, reporting on everything from presidential inaugural balls to the post-Michael Jordan NBA to a segment called So You're Living in a Police State. Born and raised in South Carolina, Colbert launched his comedy career in Chicago at The Second City, where he met Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello, with whom he created "Exit 57" and "Strangers with Candy." During his early years in comedy, Colbert worked as a writer and performer on "The Dana Carvey Show," where he began voicing Ace, one half of Robert Smigel's "Ambiguously Gay Duo." In October 2005, Colbert launched his own Emmy Award-winning show on Comedy Central, "The Colbert Report."
