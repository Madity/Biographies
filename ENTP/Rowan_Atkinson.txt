=======================================================
Rowan Sebastian Atkinson, CBE (born 6 January 1955) is an English actor, comedian, and screenwriter who is best known for his work on the sitcoms Mr. Bean and Blackadder. Atkinson first came to prominence in the sketch comedy show Not the Nine O'Clock News (1979–82), and via his participation in The Secret Policeman's Balls from 1979. His other work includes the sitcom The Thin Blue Line (1995–96).
He has been listed in The Observer as one of the 50 funniest actors in British comedy[7] and amongst the top 50 comedians ever, in a 2005 poll of fellow comedians.[8] He has also had cinematic success with his performances in the Mr. Bean movie adaptations Bean and Mr. Bean's Holiday and in Johnny English and its sequel Johnny English Reborn.
Atkinson, the youngest of four brothers, was born in Consett, County Durham, England.[9] His parents were Eric Atkinson, a farmer and company director, and Ella May (née Bainbridge), who married on 29 June 1945.[9] His three older brothers are Paul, who died as an infant; Rodney, a Eurosceptic economist who narrowly lost the United Kingdom Independence Party leadership election in 2000; and Rupert.[10][11] Atkinson was brought up Anglican,[12] and was educated at Durham Choristers School, St. Bees School, and Newcastle University, where he received a degree in Electrical Engineering.[13]
In 1975, he continued for the degree of M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at The Queen's College, Oxford, the same college his father matriculated at in 1935,[14] and which made Atkinson an Honorary Fellow in 2006.[15] First winning national attention in the Oxford Revue at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 1976,[13] he had already written and performed early sketches for shows in Oxford by the Etceteras – the revue group of the Experimental Theatre Club (ETC) and for the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS), meeting writer Richard Curtis[13] and composer Howard Goodall, with whom he would continue to collaborate during his career.
Atkinson starred in a series of comedy shows for BBC Radio 3 in 1978 called The Atkinson People. It consisted of a series of satirical interviews with fictional great men, who were played by Atkinson himself. The series was written by Atkinson and Richard Curtis, and produced by Griff Rhys Jones.[16]
After university, Atkinson toured with Angus Deayton as his straight man in an act that was eventually filmed for a television show. After the success of the show, he did a one-off pilot for London Weekend Television in 1979 called Canned Laughter. Atkinson then went on to do Not the Nine O'Clock News for the BBC, produced by his friend John Lloyd. He featured in the show with Pamela Stephenson, Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith, and was one of the main sketch writers.
The success of Not the Nine O'Clock News led to him taking the lead role in the medieval sitcom The Black Adder (1983), which he also co-wrote with Richard Curtis. After a three-year gap, in part due to budgetary concerns, a second series was broadcast, this time written by Curtis and Ben Elton. Blackadder II (1986) followed the fortunes of one of the descendants of Atkinson's original character, this time in the Elizabethan era. The same pattern was repeated in the two more sequels Blackadder the Third (1987) (set in the Regency era), and Blackadder Goes Forth (1989) (set in World War I). The Blackadder series became one of the most successful of all BBC situation comedies, spawning television specials including Blackadder's Christmas Carol (1988), Blackadder: The Cavalier Years (1988), and later Blackadder: Back & Forth (1999), which was set at the turn of the Millennium.
The final scene of "Blackadder Goes Forth" (when Blackadder and his men go "over the top" and charge into No-Man's-Land) has been described as "bold and highly poignant".[17] During the 2014 centennial of the start of World War I, Michael Gove and war historian Max Hastings have complained about the so-called "Blackadder version of history".[18][19][20]
Atkinson's other creation, the hapless Mr. Bean, first appeared on New Year's Day in 1990 in a half-hour special for Thames Television. The character of Mr. Bean has been likened to a modern-day Buster Keaton.[21] During this time, Atkinson appeared at the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal in 1987 and 1989. Several sequels to Mr. Bean appeared on television until 1995, and the character later appeared in a feature film. Bean (1997) was directed by Mel Smith, Atkinson's colleague in Not the Nine O'Clock News. A second film, Mr. Bean's Holiday, was released in 2007. In 1995 and 1996, Atkinson portrayed Inspector Raymond Fowler in The Thin Blue Line television sitcom written by Ben Elton, which takes place in a police station located in fictitious Gasforth.
Atkinson has fronted campaigns for Kronenbourg,[22] Fujifilm, and Give Blood. Atkinson appeared as a hapless and error-prone espionage agent named Richard Lathum in a long-running series of adverts for Barclaycard, on which character his title role in Johnny English and Johnny English Reborn was based. He also starred in a comedy spoof of Doctor Who as the Doctor, for a "Red Nose Day" benefit. Atkinson appeared as the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car on Top Gear in July 2011, driving the Kia Cee'd around the track in 1:42.2, placing him at the top of the leaderboard until Matt LeBlanc later recorded a 1:42.1 lap time.
Atkinson appeared at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony as Mr. Bean in a comedy sketch during a performance of "Chariots of Fire", playing a repeated single note on synthesiser.[23] He then lapsed into a dream sequence in which he joined the runners from the film of the same name (about the 1924 Summer Olympics), beating them in their iconic run along West Sands at St. Andrews, by riding in a minicab and tripping the front runner.[24]
In November 2012 it emerged that the character of Mr. Bean was to be retired. "The stuff that has been most commercially successful for me – basically quite physical, quite childish – I increasingly feel I'm going to do a lot less of," Atkinson told the Daily Telegraph's Review. "Apart from the fact that your physical ability starts to decline, I also think someone in their 50s being childlike becomes a little sad. You've got to be careful."[25] He has also said that the role typecast him to a degree.[26]
Atkinson's film career began with a supporting part in the 'unofficial' James Bond movie Never Say Never Again (1983) and a leading role in Dead on Time (also 1983) with Nigel Hawthorne. He was in the 1988 Oscar-winning short film The Appointments of Dennis Jennings. He appeared in Mel Smith's directorial debut The Tall Guy (1989) and appeared alongside Anjelica Huston and Mai Zetterling in Roald Dahl's The Witches (1990). He played the part of Dexter Hayman in Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993), a parody of Rambo III, starring Charlie Sheen.
Atkinson gained further recognition with his turn as a verbally bumbling vicar in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) and featured in Disney's The Lion King (also 1994) as the voice of Zazu the Red-billed Hornbill. Atkinson continued to appear in supporting roles in comedies, including Rat Race (2001), Scooby-Doo (2002), Love Actually (2003) and the crime comedy Keeping Mum (2005), which also starred Kristin Scott Thomas, Maggie Smith and Patrick Swayze.
In addition to his supporting roles, Atkinson has also had success as a leading man. His television character Mr. Bean debuted on the big screen with Bean (1997) to international success. A sequel, Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007) also became an international success. He has also starred in the James Bond parody Johnny English (2003) and its sequel, Johnny English Reborn (2011).

Rowan Atkinson did live on-stage skits – also appearing with members of Monty Python – in The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979) for the British section of Amnesty International.
In 1984 he appeared in a West End version of the comedy play The Nerd alongside a 10 year old Christian Bale.[27]
The Sneeze and Other Stories, seven short Anton Chekhov plays, translated and adapted by Michael Frayn, were performed by Rowan Atkinson, Timothy West and Cheryl Campbell at the Aldwych Theatre, London in 1988 and early 1989.
On 28 November 2012 Rowan Atkinson reprised the role of Blackadder at the "We are Most Amused" comedy gala for the Prince's Trust at the Royal Albert Hall. He was joined by Tony Robinson as Baldrick. The sketch involved Blackadder as CEO of Melchett, Melchett and Darling bank facing an enquiry over the banking crisis.
In 2013, Atkinson took on the titular role in a 12-week production (directed by Richard Eyre) of the Simon Gray play Quartermaine's Terms at Wyndham's Theatre in London with costars Conleth Hill (Game of Thrones) and Felicity Montagu (I'm Alan Partridge).
At the end of 2013, he revived his schoolmaster sketch for Royal Free Hospital's Rocks with Laughter at the Adelphi Theatre. A few days prior, he performed a selection of sketches in a small coffee venue in front of only 30 people.[28]
Best known for his use of physical comedy in his Mr. Bean persona, Atkinson's other characters rely more heavily on language. Atkinson often plays authority figures (especially priests or vicars) speaking absurd lines with a completely deadpan delivery.
One of his better-known comic devices is over-articulation of the "B" sound, such as his pronunciation of "Bob" in the Blackadder II episode "Bells". Atkinson suffers from a stammer,[29] and the over-articulation is a technique to overcome problematic consonants.
Atkinson's often visually based style, which has been compared to that of Buster Keaton,[21] sets him apart from most modern television and film comics, who rely heavily on dialogue, as well as stand-up comedy which is mostly based on monologues. This talent for visual comedy has led to Atkinson being called "the man with the rubber face": comedic reference was made to this in an episode of Blackadder the Third ("Sense and Senility"), in which Baldrick (Tony Robinson) refers to his master, Mr. E. Blackadder, as a "lazy, big-nosed, rubber-faced bastard".
Rowan Atkinson was formerly in a relationship with actress Leslie Ash.[30] He married Sunetra Sastry in 1990.[31] The couple first met in the late 1980s, when she was working as a makeup artist with the BBC.[32] They have two children, daughter Lily (an actress), and son Benjamin.
In February 2014, it was announced that Atkinson had filed for divorce from Sastry, his wife of 23 years.[33] Subsequently, he moved out of the family home and into a flat in west London. He has since been seen with his new girlfriend, actress Louise Ford. They started dating after the two worked alongside each other in the comic play Quartermaine’s Terms.[34]
In June 2005, Atkinson led a coalition of the UK's most prominent actors and writers, including Nicholas Hytner, Stephen Fry, and Ian McEwan, to the British Parliament in an attempt to force a review of the controversial Racial and Religious Hatred Bill, which they felt would give overwhelming power to religious groups to impose censorship on the arts.[35] In 2009, he criticized homophobic speech legislation, saying that the House of Lords must vote against a government attempt to remove a free speech clause in an anti-gay hate law.[36]
In 2012, he voiced his support for the Reform Section 5 campaign,[37] which aims to reform or repeal Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986, particularly its statement that an insult can be grounds for arrest and punishment. It is a reaction to several recent high-profile arrests, which Atkinson sees as a restriction of freedom of expression.[38]
With an estimated wealth of approximately £85 million, Atkinson is able to indulge his passion for cars that began with driving his mother's Morris Minor around the family farm. He has written for the British magazines Car, Octane, Evo, and "SuperClassics", a short-lived UK magazine, in which he reviewed the McLaren F1 in 1995.
Atkinson holds a category C+E (formerly 'Class 1') lorry driving licence, gained in 1981, because lorries held a fascination for him, and to ensure employment as a young actor. He has also used this skill when filming comedy material. In 1991, he starred in the self-penned The Driven Man, a series of sketches featuring Atkinson driving around London trying to solve his obsession with cars, and discussing it with taxi drivers, policemen, used-car salesmen and psychotherapists.[39] A lover of and participant in car racing, he appeared as racing driver Henry Birkin in the television play Full Throttle in 1995.
Atkinson has raced in other cars, including a Renault 5 GT Turbo for two seasons for its one make series. He owns a McLaren F1, which was involved in an accident in Cabus, near Garstang, Lancashire with an Austin Metro in October 1999.[40] It was damaged again in a serious crash in August 2011 when it caught fire after Atkinson reportedly lost control and hit a tree.[41][42] He has previously owned a Honda NSX. Other cars he owns include an Audi A8,[43] and a Honda Civic Hybrid.[44]
The Conservative Party politician Alan Clark, himself a devotee of classic motor cars, recorded in his published Diaries a chance meeting with a man he later realised was Atkinson while driving through Oxfordshire in May 1984: "Just after leaving the motorway at Thame I noticed a dark red DBS V8 Aston Martin on the slip road with the bonnet up, a man unhappily bending over it. I told Jane to pull in and walked back. A DV8 in trouble is always good for a gloat." Clark writes that he gave Atkinson a lift in his Rolls-Royce to the nearest telephone box, but was disappointed in his bland reaction to being recognised, noting that: "he didn't sparkle, was rather disappointing and chétif."[45]
One car Atkinson has said he will not own is a Porsche: "I have a problem with Porsches. They're wonderful cars, but I know I could never live with one. Somehow, the typical Porsche people – and I wish them no ill – are not, I feel, my kind of people. I don't go around saying that Porsches are a pile of dung, but I do know that psychologically I couldn't handle owning one."[46][47]
While on a holiday trip to Kenya in 2001, the pilot of his private plane fainted. Atkinson managed to maintain the plane in the air for several minutes until the pilot recovered and was able to regain control.[48]
Atkinson was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to drama and charity.[49][50]

He played "Mr. Bean" in the TV series, Mr. Bean (1990) but, apart from that and Not the Nine O'Clock News (1979), he also appeared in several other series like The Black Adder (1983) and Funny Business (1992), etc.Atkinson enjoys nothing better than fast cars. He has been married to Sunetra Sastry since 1990, and they have two children, named Benjamin and Lily.
      Father of a son, Benjamin Alexander Sebastian Atkinson (born 1993) and a daughter, Lily Grace Atkinson (aka Lily Atkinson) (born 1995), with his wife Sunetra Sastry.
      Rides go-karts round his tennis courts and, according to Stephen Fry (his best man), "hasn't got an ounce of showbiz in him".
      Has an HGV license (Heavy Goods Vehicle - the old legal term in the United Kingdom for goods vehicles weighing more than 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight).
      Education: Newcastle University, Newcastle, UK (electrical engineering); Oxford University, Oxford, UK (electrical engineering)
      He was awarded the Laurence Olivier Theatre Award for Best Comedy Performance in 1982 for the 1981 season.
      Once crashed his MacLaren F1, a supercar valued at more than $1,000,000, into the back of a stationary Mini Metro, valued at around $600. The damage was not severe.
      Has publicly opposed the British Labour government's plans to introduce new legislation on incitement to religious hatred, arguing that it would undermine free speech and thought (even citing the possible development of mind-reading technology), and that such measures would make political satire - which he considers seminal in a democracy - unworkable.
      Along with Tony Robinson and Tim McInnerny, he is one of only three actors to appear in all four "Blackadder" series: The Black Adder (1983), Black-Adder II (1986), Black Adder the Third (1987) and Blackadder Goes Forth (1989).

      His grandparents were all born in Durham. His paternal grandparents were Edward Atkinson, of Spennymoor, and Edith Gertrude Browell, of Crookhall. His maternal grandparents were Frank Bainbridge, of Hartlepool, and Ella Schofield, of Grosmont.
      People think because I can make them laugh on the stage, I'll be able to make them laugh in person. That isn't the case at all. I am essentially a rather quiet, dull person who just happens to be a performer.
      [commenting in 2004 on Britain's proposed Racial and Religious Hatred Bill] To criticize a person for their race is manifestly irrational and ridiculous, but to criticize their religion, that is a right. That is a freedom. The freedom to criticize ideas, any ideas - even if they are sincerely held beliefs - is one of the fundamental freedoms of society. A law which attempts to say you can criticize and ridicule ideas as long as they are not religious ideas is a very peculiar law indeed.
      Mr. Bean is essentially a child trapped in the body of a man. All cultures identify with children in a similar way, so he has this bizarre global outreach. And 10-year-old boys from different cultures have more in common than 30-year-olds. As we grow up, we acquire this sensibility that divides us.
      I remember looking up Johnny English (2003) in a film guide and it said 'intermittently hilarious' - quite a good description of five good jokes and a lot of longueurs. I find it frustrating that, apart from Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), I have yet to be involved in a film of which I am totally proud.
      The casual ease which some people move from finding something offensive to wishing to declare it criminal - and are then able to find factions within government to aid their ambitions - is truly depressing.
      [on being overwhelmed by fans at a Toronto shopping mall] It's a bit disconcerting being treated like Madonna.
      [preparing to perform onstage the title role in Simon Gray's 'Quartermaine's Terms'] It's well known that tragedy and comedy are close bedfellows. It's rare, though, that you see them placed in such intimacy. Like most tragic figures, 'Quartermaine' is unaware of his own tragedy. What I love about him is his optimism. You don't tend to feel much sympathy for pessimistic people, but those who retain their optimism, despite the sadness of their lives, are interesting, engaging and sympathetic.

Best known to American audiences as the Black Adder and Mr. Bean, black-haired, bug-eyed, and weak-chinned comedian Rowan Atkinson is one of the most popular funnymen in England whose keen, often black humor and knack for physical comedy has earned him a huge international following. Born in Newcastle, Atkinson was educated at Newcastle University and Oxford. While at the latter, he teamed up with budding screenwriter Richard Curtis to write comedy reviews for the Oxford Playhouse. Shortly thereafter, the two created material for the Edinburgh Fringe. By 1978, Atkinson's humor had earned him a devoted fan base and he was offered leading roles in two British television comedies. Instead, Atkinson chose to get involved in the internationally acclaimed comedy series Not the Nine O'Clock News as a writer and a performer. His performances in the oft-distinguished show earned Atkinson a British Academy Award and got him designated "BBC Personality of the Year" in 1980. His stage performances also continued to significantly increase his popularity. In 1983, he and Curtis created the Black Adder, a cowardly and conniving Tudor Prince named Edmund who tries vainly to become King of England after inadvertently killing his father during a battle. Billed as a "situation tragedy" on the BBC, it ran three seasons and later spawned a couple of specials. Atkinson made his feature-film debut in the 1983 James Bond thriller Never Say Never Again. In the late '80s, he starred in a few films penned by Curtis. It was while they were filming The Tall Guy that Atkinson and Curtis created Mr. Bean, an average British Joe with a clumsy nature and a nasty streak and launched a series. Different from other shows in that it was largely silent, Atkinson's Bean demonstrated a rare gift for slapstick that has led to his being compared to Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. During its six year run, Mr. Bean became the most popular show in the U.K. and has since been shown in 89 countries where it has gained a cult following comparable to Monty Python and Fawlty Towers. Atkinson himself attributes his character's popularity to the fact that the socially awkward, middle-aged Bean's mundane adventures, largely due to his clumsy inability to cope with even the smallest of life's foibles, mirror the feelings and experiences of people the world over. In 1997, Atkinson brought the character to the big screen in Bean. Other notable Atkinson film performances include his voice characterization of Zazu in The Lion King and that of the hilariously inarticulate priest in Four Weddings and a Funeral. Atkinson oversaw an animated television series based on his beloved Mr. Bean character, and then took a cameo part in his longtime collaborator Richard Curtis' directorial debut Love Actually. In 2003 he starred in another international comedy hit, the spy spoof Johnny English, a movie so successful it spawned a sequel in 2011. In addition, Atkinson returned to the well yet again in 2007 with the feature length Mr. Bean's Holiday, which co-starred Willem Dafoe. ~ Sandra Brennan, Rovi

"Funny things tend not to happen to me. I am not a natural comic. I need to think about things a lot before I can be even remotely amusing."
He has been listed in The Observer as one of the 50 funniest actors in British comedy and amongst the top 50 comedians ever.
He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to drama and charity.
Introduction: In 2006 Rowan Atkinson and his wife bought a house in Oxfordshire for £2,647,500. The Handsmooth House covers an area of 16 acres and overlooks the Chilterns. The property was in dilapidated condition before Atkinson decided to demolish it and build a new age home in its place.
Accommodation: The house will look like a white and glass structure and it covers an area of 8,000 sq ft. The property will be designed by noted architect, Richard Meier. The old house had a swimming pool but as per reports that too will be demolished to make way for a two storied luxury guest house that will be placed behind the property and by the side of a hillside. The star has also hired award-winning designer Tom Stuart-Smith to re-create a meadow at the front side of the property. The main home will have a lovely Japanese garden and own wood to protect the star and his wife from over enthusiastic neighbors.
Features: The state-of-the-art home overlooks the magnificent Chiltern Hills and it will have a bridge that will run over the courtyard that connects the two wings of the house. The house also features a tennis court, stables,the lawned terrace and an underground garage to house the huge collection cars that Mr Atkinson has.
Neighborhood: The house is located in countryside and initially the actor faced much flak from the neighbors for planning to build a modern home in place of the age old property. They reckoned that the new-age home will not match with the surroundings but Rowan thought otherwise. However, it does not mean that that the neighbors are hostile in nature as all problems has been sorted out now.
He bought the McLaren F1 car to celebrate the huge success of his film, The Bean. This is one of the most exclusive cars in the world and definitely one of the fastest. The production car speed record is 240mph which was only broken recently. He bought this car in 1997 for £650,000 and was very happy to buy this sports car. It is a 2-door, 3-seat coupe that has a 6-speed manual transmission. In terms of fuel consumption the car achieves an average of 15 L/100 km.
Rowan Atkinson is a car fanatic and he has a large fleet of cars. He owns a number of Honda cars including the Honda Civic Hybrid. This is a very popular compact car in the United States. The car is well known for its reliability and low running costs. The Hybrid version that the actor owns has a powerful electric motor which results in a total output of 110hp and boasts of improved fuel mileage. The interior is more or less similar across all models and the hybrid version has a multi-function display. The exterior is stylish and subtle and overall the car is an excellent choice for everyday use.
The famous comedian actor is known all over for his vintage and classic car collection including an Aston Martin V-8 Zagato. The Zagato is one of the most sought after models in the Aston Martin collection. The design of the V-8 Zagato is considered to be very striking but at the same time quite controversial as it reminds you of the 1980s. But it can be emphatically said that it is a true driving machine. The revised suspension has ensured that it is one of the fastest and best handled cars from the stables of Aston Martin. The car made its first appearance in the 1986 Geneva motorshow but since production was very limited, no one ever saw this car on road. The price of the car is around £70,000 but it can be safely said that it is a worthy investment on part of the comedian. The bulgy bonnet of the car may not appeal to everybody but it is a classic car in its own right.
Amnesty International is a global organization which enjoys the support of millions of supporters, members and activists, Rowan Atkinson being one of the supporters. The noted comedian is actively associated with the organization and in 2004 he was chosen to speak in an audience Q&A following the screening of a new film by Amnesty International. The organization is committed to fight against grave violation of human rights. Their vision is to ensure that each human being gets to enjoy rights that have been laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They carry on with their work irrespective of government, political ideology and economic interests.
Rowan Atkinson is known for his philanthropic activities and is an active supporter of the non-profit organization Comic Relief, which raises funds for those in need. Comic Relief is considered as an honorary charity of the comedy community. In 1998 the organization managed to raise more than $50 million to create programs that will help the needy. The organization successfully raised money for the city of New Orleans to restore life and normalcy in the city which was totally devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
Rowan has a genuine concern for the unfortunate children and that is the reason why he supports the charity organization Save the Children, which is a leading independent organization that strives to bring about a lasting change in the lives of the children in the United States and in other parts of the world. The organization swings into action whenever a disaster strikes and helps to save lives with food, medical care and education. Their efforts during the Tsunami and civil conflicts are well known and are appreciated all over. Everyday less fortunate children face adversities like hunger and poverty and so the organization makes every effort to make their life better.
Kids Company was founded in 1996 with the aim to provide practical, emotional and educational support to the inner-city children. There are around an estimated 17,000 children across London who are deprived of some of the basic needs of life as their parents are unable to take care of them due to their own set of problems. Both the adults and the children struggle to survive in these conditions. These children are most vulnerable as they are exposed to violence and sometimes forced to act as drug couriers or prostitutes. Kids Company strives to end the plight of these children and their efforts receives a boost when celebrities join their cause. In 2008 Rowan made a surprise visit to the Kids Company center on Christmas Day and the children were pleasantly surprised. As Mr Bean arrived there were shrieks of delight all around.

You may not recognize Rowan Atkinson's name, but you'll undoubtedly recognize his work: he's Mr. Bean! We've got the rundown on Rowan's life and work (but we never did figure out how he got his head inside that turkey)!
Little Rowan was born in Consett, England to Anglican farmers Ella May and Eric Atkinson, who had two older sons Rupert and Rodney. He attended the same prep school as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair (who was two years ahead of Rowan) and went on to study electrical engineering at Newcastle University. With his future looking rather un-funny, Rowan continued his studies at Oxford University, where he earned a masters degree. It was while he was at Oxford that Rowan planted the seeds that would eventually grow the Bean we all know and love.
While studying at Oxford, Rowan joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society and the Experimental Theatre Club, where he caught the comedy bug in a big way. Rather than pursue a career in his chosen field after graduation, Rowan began to tour in a comedy duo with his friend Angus Deayton. Their act was eventually filmed for TV, and soon the two were famous in their home country. He was offered his own TV show, but turned it down in order to do the sketch show, Not the Nine O'Clock News. That show eventually led to the hugely popular comedy Blackadder - a comedy set in the middle ages. Rowan Atkinson was now a huge celebrity in the UK, but his next role would make him a worldwide star.
Rowan appeared in a half-hour TV special called Mr. Bean in 1988. The show caught on at home in the UK and abroad, and led to several more TV specials and a big screen film titled Bean, which debuted in 1997. Rowan went on to feature in plenty of other big screen hits including Four Weddings and a Funeral with Hugh Grant, and the James Bond parody Johnny English, but the call of the Bean was hard to ignore: Rowan will star in Mr. Bean's Holiday, due out August 24, 2007!
Rowan and his wife Sunetra Sastry have two children - Lily and Benjamin. Lily makes an appearance in Mr. Bean's Holiday.
Bean gets his head stuck inside a raw turkey in a Mr. Bean Christmas special. The gag was spoofed on an episode of Friends.
"People think because I can make them laugh on the stage, I'll be able to make them laugh in person. That isn't the case at all. I am essentially a rather quiet, dull person who just happens to be a performer."
I literally cannot wait to see this movie!! It comes out tomorrow, but I already have my tickets of course. I've read the book 7 times already, and I cry every single time. The story and characters are perfect. Hazel Grace & Augustus Waters are life okay. John Greene will remain the best author, in my opinion. Just so psyched to see this movie :D!!!!
