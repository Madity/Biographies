William "Bill" Maher, Jr. (/ˈmɑːr/; born January 20, 1956) is an American stand-up comedian, television host, political commentator, satirist, author, and actor. Before his current role as the host of HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher, Maher hosted a similar late-night talk show called Politically Incorrect, originally on Comedy Central and later on ABC.
Maher is known for his sarcastic attitude,[1] political satire and sociopolitical commentary, which targets a wide swath of topics including religion, politics, bureaucracies of many kinds, political correctness, the mass media, greed among people and persons in positions of high political and social power, and the lack of intellectual curiosity in the electorate.[2]
Maher supports the legalization of marijuana and same-sex marriage. His critical views of religion were the basis for the 2008 documentary film Religulous. He serves on the board of PETA and is an advisory board member of Project Reason.[3][4] In 2005, Maher ranked at number 38 on Comedy Central's 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time.[5] Bill Maher received a Hollywood Walk of Fame star on September 14, 2010.[6]
Maher was born in New York City. His father, William Maher, Sr., was a network news editor and radio announcer, and his mother, Julie Maher (née Berman), was a nurse.[7] He was raised in his Irish American father's Catholic religion, unaware that his Hungarian American[8][9][10] mother was Jewish until his early teens.[11][12][13][14] Owing to his disagreement with the Catholic Church's doctrine about birth control, Maher's father stopped taking Maher and his sister to Catholic church services when Maher was thirteen.[15]
Maher was raised in River Vale, New Jersey, and graduated from Pascack Hills High School in Montvale in 1974. He then enrolled in Cornell University where he double majored in English and history. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1978.[16] Maher has said selling pot allowed him to make enough money to get through college and enter comedy.[17]
Maher began his career as a stand-up comedian and actor. He was host of the New York City comedy club Catch a Rising Star in 1979.[citation needed] Maher began appearing on Johnny Carson's and David Letterman's shows in 1982. He made limited television appearances including a recurring role in Sara (1985), appeared in Max Headroom (1987), two separate appearances on Murder, She Wrote (1989, 1990), a recurring role in Charlie Hoover (1991) and other productions. His feature film debut was in D.C. Cab (1983). He later appeared in Ratboy (1986), House II: The Second Story (1987), Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death (1988), and Pizza Man (1991), among others.
Maher assumed the host role on Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher, a late-night political talk show that ran on Comedy Central from 1993 to 1997 and on ABC from 1997 to 2002. The show regularly began with a topical monologue by Maher preceding the introduction of four guests, usually a diverse group of individuals, such as show business, popular culture, political pundits, political consultants, authors, and occasionally news figures. The group would discuss topical issues selected by Maher, who also participated in the discussions.[18] Jerry Seinfeld, a regular guest on the show, stated that Politically Incorrect reminded him of talk shows from the 1950s and 60s "when guests interacted with each other as much as with the host."[19]
Politically Incorrect won an array of awards, including an Emmy Award for Outstanding Technical Direction, two CableACE awards for Best Talk Show Series, and a Genesis Award for Best Television Talk Show. Maher earned numerous award nominations for his producing, writing and hosting of Politically Incorrect, including ten Emmy nominations, two TV Guide nominations, and two Writers Guild nominations. ABC decided against renewing Maher's contract for Politically Incorrect in 2002, after he made a controversial on-air remark six days after the September 11 attacks.[20] He agreed with his guest, conservative pundit Dinesh D'Souza, that the 9/11 terrorists did not act in a cowardly manner (in rebuttal to President Bush's statement calling 9/11 hijackers cowards). Maher said, "We have been the cowards. Lobbing cruise missiles from two thousand miles away. That's cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building. Say what you want about it. Not cowardly. You're right." Maher later clarified that his comment was not anti-military in any way whatsoever, referencing his well-documented longstanding support for the American military.[21][22] After receiving complaints, FedEx and Sears Roebuck pulled their advertisements from the show, costing the show significant revenue.[23][24]
Maher's remarks after 9/11 were not the first time he had sparked controversy on Politically Incorrect. In the same year, he expressed his deep regrets and apologized after being widely criticized for comparing his dogs to retarded children.[25]
The show was canceled on June 16, 2002, and the Sinclair Broadcast Group had dropped the show from its ABC-affiliated stations months prior. On June 22, 2002, just six days after the cancellation of Politically Incorrect, Maher received the Los Angeles Press Club president's award (for "championing free speech").[24] Maher was on the board of judges for the 2002 PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award.[26]
In 2003, Maher became the host, co-producer and co-writer of Real Time with Bill Maher, a weekly hour-long political comedy talk show on the cable television network HBO. HBO announced in July 2011 the show had been renewed for its tenth season (2012) and is currently in its 12th.[27] During an interview, Maher told Terry Gross (on NPR's Fresh Air) that he much prefers having serious and well-informed guests on his program, as opposed to the random celebrities that fleshed out his roundtable discussions on Politically Incorrect.[28]
As with his previous show, Politically Incorrect, Maher begins Real Time with a comic opening monologue based upon current events and other topical issues. He proceeds to a one-on-one interview with a guest, either in-studio or via satellite. Following the interview, Maher sits with three panelists, usually consisting of pundits, authors, activists and journalists, for a discussion of the week's events. In the segment "New Rules" at the end of each show, Maher delivers a humorous editorial on popular culture and American politics.
In late May 2005, Alabama Congressman Spencer Bachus sent a letter to Time Warner's board of directors requesting Real Time be canceled after remarks Maher made after noting the military had missed its recruiting goals by 42 percent. Bachus said he felt the comments were demeaning to the military and treasonous. Maher stated his highest regard and support for the troops and asked why the congressman criticized him instead of doing something about the recruitment problem.[29]
Real Time has earned widespread praise. It has been nominated for more than ten Primetime Emmy Awards and six Writer's Guild awards. In 2007, Maher and his co-producers were awarded the Television Producer of the Year Award in Variety Television by the Producers Guild of America.[30] Maher holds the record for the most Emmy nominations without a win, having been nominated on 22 occasions and not winning once. Eleven of the nominations were for Politically Incorrect, while nine were for Real Time. The other two were nominations for two of his HBO comedy specials: Bill Maher: I'm Swiss and Bill Maher: The Decider.[31]
On September 17, 2010, Maher aired a clip of Delaware Republican Senatorial candidate Christine O'Donnell from the October 29, 1999, episode of his old show Politically Incorrect on his current show Real Time with Bill Maher,[32][33] where she discussed that she had "dabbled in witchcraft." This was one of the most notable of numerous controversial statements by O'Donnell that made her the most covered candidate in the 2010 mid-term election cycle.[34][35]
Maher is a frequent commentator on various cable news networks, including CNN, MSNBC, FOX News Channel and HLN. Maher has regularly appeared on CNN's The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer[36] and has also been a frequent guest on MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews,[37] The Rachel Maddow Show,[38] and Countdown with Keith Olbermann.[39] Maher has also appeared as a guest on HLN's The Joy Behar Show.[40]
Maher hosted the January 13, 2006 edition of Larry King Live, on which he was a frequent guest. Maher appeared as a special guest on the June 29, 2010 edition of the show, on which CNN anchor Larry King announced his retirement.[41] Maher co-emceed the final show of Larry King Live on December 16, 2010 with Ryan Seacrest.[42]
Maher and Ingrid Newkirk, founder of PETA. Maher is on the board of directors of the animal rights group.
Maher eschews political labels, referring to himself as "practical".[45] In the past, he has described himself as a libertarian, and has also referred to himself "as a progressive, as a sane person".[46][47] He has also referred to himself as a "9/11 liberal", noting that his formerly liberal view of Muslims changed as a result of the attacks on September 11, 2001, and he differentiates himself from liberals in his opinion that all religions are not the same.[48]
Maher favors ending corporate welfare and federal funding of non-profits as well as the legalization of gambling, prostitution, and marijuana. Maher is a member of the advisory boards for both the NORML and Marijuana Policy Project, organizations which support regulated legalization of marijuana.[49][50] He describes himself as an environmentalist, and he has spoken in favor of the Kyoto treaty on global warming on his show Real Time. He often criticizes industry figures involved in environmental pollution.[51]
Before the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Maher became candid in his stated opposition to the re-election of President George W. Bush and in his support for Senator John Kerry D-Massachusetts.[52]
Known for protesting against the demonization of the word "liberal", during the campaign Maher criticized Kerry for being ashamed of the word. On his show, the comedian has noted the paradox of people claiming they distrusted "elite" politicians while at the same time wanting elite doctors to treat them and elite lawyers to represent them in court.[53] Maher supports the death penalty.[54] Since the 9/11 attacks, he has endorsed the use of racial profiling at airports.[55]
He was originally against the Iraq War, and has summarized his opinion by saying that the United States and the world have had to pay too high a price for the war. He is skeptical of Iraq surviving without civil war.[56]
In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Maher announced his support for Senator Barack Obama D-Illinois.[57] Although Maher welcomed Obama's electoral victory, he has subjected him to criticism since taking office for not acting boldly on health care reform and other progressive issues.[58]
On February 23, 2012, after his 'Crazy Stupid Politics' special streamed on Yahoo! Screen, Maher announced that he was contributing $1 million to Priorities USA, the Obama SuperPAC.[59][60]
Maher is a gun owner, and explained in his February 12, 2013 appearance on the late night TV talk show Conan that he owns guns for personal home protection. However, he does not identify himself as a "proud" gun owner, commenting that being a proud gun owner is akin to "saying I'm a 'proud remote control owner'". Maher has stated that statistics showing that gun owners are more likely to harm a member of their household are caused by irresponsible gun owners, and believes that tragedies such as school shootings will not lead to fundamental change in gun laws because both Democrats and Republicans favor guns.[61]
On June 7, 2013, Bill Maher expressed on his show limited support for the NSA's PRISM intelligence data collection from private phone calls and the Internet, saying that the threat of terrorists obtaining and using nuclear weapons was the tipping point for him. While he stated that he trusted the Obama administration to employ the program responsibly, he described the NSA's access to private data as a "slippery slope", and worried about whether other politicians would be as responsible.[62]
Maher is highly critical of religion and views it as highly destructive. He is described as an agnostic, and refers to himself as one in his feature film Religulous.[63] As for labels, he has denied being an atheist, saying, "I'm not an atheist. There's a really big difference between an atheist and someone who just doesn't believe in religion. Religion to me is a bureaucracy between man and God that I don't need. But I'm not an atheist, no."[64] Maher has also occasionally referred to himself as an "apatheist", saying "I don't know what happens when you die, and I don't care", adding, "there's atheist and there's agnostic, and I'm okay with us not splitting the difference on those; if you are just not a super-religious person, you are on my team".[64][65] He has reiterated his stance in subsequent interviews, rejecting both the certitude of the existence, as well as the certitude of nonexistence of deities, concluding, "I'm saying that doubt is the only appropriate response for human beings."[66] He is an advisory board member of author Sam Harris's Project Reason, a foundation that promotes scientific knowledge and secular values within society.
Maher and director Larry Charles teamed up to make the movie Religulous, described by trade publication Variety as a documentary "that spoofs religious extremism across the world." It was released on October 3, 2008.[67][68]
Maher is critical towards organized religion as a whole, but believes that "all religions are not alike." Maher says there is something different about Islam, in that "there is no other religion that is asking for the death" of people who dare to criticize it.[69][70] On October 29, 2010, during a Real Time segment, Maher commented on a news story that reported that the name Mohammed had become the most popular baby name in the United Kingdom. He asked, "Am I a racist to feel alarmed by that? Because I am. And it's not because of the race, it's because of the religion. I don’t have to apologize, do I, for not wanting the Western world to be taken over by Islam in 300 years? Sharia law is being institutionalized in England? Well, then I am right, I should be alarmed."[71] He later defended his comments on CNN, saying, "And when I say Westerner, I mean someone who believes in the values that Western people believe in that a lot of the Muslim world does not. Like separation of church and state. Like equality of the sexes. Like respect for minorities, free elections, free speech, freedom to gather. These things are not just different from cultures that don’t have them...It’s better...I would like to keep those values here."[72]
On Fox News in a televised debate with Bill O'Reilly, Maher said that "if Jesus was in charge of the country we’d probably have health care for everybody."[73]
Maher was ranked first by MormonVoices, a group associated with Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research, on its Top Ten Anti-Mormon Statements of 2011 list for saying "By any standard, Mormonism is more ridiculous than any other religion".[75]
Maher has stated that the American Medical Association is a powerful lobbying group and one of the primary reasons why the United States had failed to enact health care reform.[76][77]
On August 24, 2009, Maher was a guest on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. On the topic of getting health care reform legislation passed, Maher stated that Obama should forget about trying to get 60 votes for it, "he only needs 51." "Forget getting the sixty votes or sixty percent — sixty percent of people don't believe in evolution in this country — he just needs to drag them to it, like I said, they're stupid; get health care done, with or without them."[78]
Maher has expressed the view that most illness is generally the result of poor diet and lack of exercise, and that medicine is often not the best way of addressing illness. In an episode of his show about the 2008 presidential candidates' health plans, Maher stated that poor nutrition is a primary cause of illness, and that "the answer isn't another pill."[79] He also has said:" If you believe you need to take all the pills the pharmaceutical industry says you do, then you're already on drugs!"[80]
He has expressed his distaste for the pharmaceutical and health care industries in general, on the grounds that they make their money out of treating people who are made sick by consuming unhealthy food that corporations urge upon the public. He maintains that mass consumption of high-fructose corn syrup is a contributor to the rise in frequency of obesity in the United States.[81]
In a discussion with Michael Moore about the film Sicko, Maher said, "The human body is pretty amazing; it doesn't get sick, usually, for no reason. I mean, there's some genetic stuff that can get to you, but, basically, people are sick in this country because they're poisoned. The environment is a poisoning factor, but also, we gotta say, they poison themselves. They eat shit. People eat shit, and that's, to my way of thinking, about 90 percent of why people are sick, is because they eat shit."[82]
On October 9, 2009, on his HBO show, Maher debated the effectiveness of flu vaccinations with Bill Frist and stated, "Why would you let them be the ones to stick a disease into your arm? I would never get a swine flu vaccine or any vaccine. I don’t trust the government, especially with my health." Maher also expressed skepticism about the seriousness of the swine flu and whether completely healthy people could die from it.
Maher's comments on medicine have generated criticism from the medical and skeptic communities, and his remarks have been called unscientific and even harmful.[83] Infectious diseases expert Paul Offit has written that misinformation about vaccines from celebrities like Maher have put children at unnecessary risk. Offit notes that celebrities like Maher are seen as "less credible" and would still be considered just "great entertainment" if they weren't joined by the former Director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Bernadine Healy and influential pediatrician, Dr. Robert Sears.[84] Oncologist, David Gorski has also criticized Maher's beliefs about vaccines several times in ScienceBlogs, and when Maher received the Richard Dawkins Award in 2009, Gorski wrote it was inappropriate.[85] Skeptics, including mathematician and science writer Martin Gardner,[86] neurologist Steven Novella,[87] and magician Jamy Ian Swiss have also strongly rebuked Maher, characterizing him as anti-science, uninformed and potentially endangering the health of fans who take his "non-medical" advice.[88]
Maher responded to the criticism, saying, "What I've read about what they think I'm saying is not what I've said. I'm not a germ theory denier. I believe vaccinations can work. Polio is a good example. Do I think in certain situations that inoculating Third World children against malaria or diphtheria, or whatever, is right? Of course. In a situation like that, the benefits outweigh costs. But to me living in Los Angeles? To get a flu shot? No."[89]
Maher has been a critic of 9/11 conspiracy theories. On October 19, 2007, Maher confronted several 9/11 truthers and had them ejected from his show audience after they interrupted the live show numerous times by calling out from the audience. The incident drew significant media attention and praise from Fox News talk show host and frequent critic John Gibson.[90]
Maher has never married.[91][92] Regarding marriage, Maher is quoted on his website as saying, "I'm the last of my guy friends to have never gotten married, and their wives — they don't want them playing with me. I'm like the escaped slave — I bring news of freedom."[93]
In 2003, he began dating former Playboy Cyber Girl Coco Johnsen. In November 2004, at the end of their 17-month relationship, she sued him for USD $9 million for "pain and suffering" for alleged "insulting, humiliating and degrading racial comments." Her suit stated that Maher promised to marry her and father her children, support her financially, and purchase a Beverly Hills home. Her suit also alleged that she quit her job as a flight attendant and occasional model to be with him.[94] Maher's lawyers in their response filed on November 23, 2004, in Los Angeles Superior Court said Maher is a "confirmed bachelor, and a very public one at that" who "never promised to marry [Johnsen] or to have children with her."[95] Maher's filing stated that, after the relationship had ended, Johnsen "launched a campaign to embarrass, humiliate, and extort ridiculous sums of money from Bill Maher." Johnsen accused another former boyfriend of rape and kidnapping in 1997, and the charges were later dismissed for lack of evidence.[96][97][98] The lawsuit was dismissed on May 2, 2005.[99][100]
In 2005, he began dating Karrine Steffans, best-selling author and former hip hop model.[101][102][103] When commentators suggested there was a pattern to his dating because both his girlfriend and former girlfriend were black, Maher said, "People say I'm into black women. Robert De Niro is into black women. I'm just into women who are real, and they happen to be black."[102]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Bill Maher was born in New York City and grew up in River Vale, NJ. His father, William, Sr., who was of Irish descent, was a radio announcer and news editor. His Jewish mother, Julie (Berman), was a nurse. Maher was raised in his father's Catholic faith. While attending Cornell University, he decided to try stand-up comedy. His first stand-up routine was in a Chinese restaurant on Route 17 in Paramus, NJ. He soon landed a regular gig at Catch a Rising Star in New York City. After a few years, he became a regular host at the club and was spotted by a scout for The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962). Maher made numerous appearances on the show, and Carson had been a hero of his since childhood, but he always felt constrained by the rules of network television. During this time, he appeared in films and made guest appearances on numerous sitcoms.In 1993, Maher was offered his own talk show by Comedy Central. Maher developed the show as a round table discussion on current events. Politically Incorrect (1993) premiered to critical acclaim and attracted major celebrities as well as politicians and pundits. In 1997, the show moved to ABC where it aired to continued success. On September 17, 2001, Maher made controversial comments regarding the terrorists who orchestrated the September 11 attack on the US. Sponsors pulled their ads and affiliates refused to air the show. ABC canceled the show in 2002, citing "low ratings". Maher had been nominated for 11 Emmys for his work on the show. In 2003, he was able to continue his television work with a similar program on HBO titled Real Time with Bill Maher (2003). He remains single and lives in Los Angeles.
      Received a great deal of bad press for his comments after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center when he criticized the United States government. Subsequently, advertisers such as Sears and Federal Express pulled their ads and some television stations stop showing his program Politically Incorrect (1993). This eventually led to ABC canceling the show the following year. Commentators such as Rush Limbaugh, Arianna Huffington, and David Horowitz defended his right to free speech and said that his program should not be canceled.
      22 June 2002 - Received the Los Angeles Press Club's highest honor, the President's Award, for "championing free speech." The award was given six days after the final episode of Politically Incorrect (1993), Bill's social-satire show from which he was dismissed for politically incorrect statements about the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center.
      Was a major supporter of Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. Though he traditionally supports Democrats, in 2000 he threw his support behind Green Party candidate Ralph Nader.
      Bill played Bob on an episode of Roseanne (1988). Ten years prior to the start of that show, he played a character named Bob in the movie D.C. Cab (1983) when he was an up-and-coming comedian.
      Host of Real Time with Bill Maher (2003), live on Friday nights at 11:30pm on Home Box Office. [February 2003]
      His paternal grandfather, Michal Maher, was born in New Jersey, to Irish parents, and his paternal grandmother, Mary, was an Irish immigrant. His maternal grandparents' families, whose surnames were "Berman" and "Fuchs" (later changed to "Fox"), were Jewish immigrants from Hungary who settled in New York.
      The cable TV sex channels don't expand our horizons, don't make us better people, and don't come in clearly enough.
      [from a 1998 "Mother Jones" interview] My generation didn't face the kind of urgent, pressing issues that my parents did, who fought through a war and a Depression and know what suffering is. That's why Bob Dole had a tough time with this electorate. He was an old-fashioned curmudgeon who knew about sacrifice, and we didn't know if we could live up to his standards. But we knew we could live up to Bill Clinton's. He's more like one of us.
      I get the Playboy thing a lot. People assume I go out with bimbos. I couldn't go out with bimbos if I tried! I scare them off! The women that like me are smart. So I go to the Playboy Mansion four or five times a year, but people think I go all the time.
      We have been the cowards, lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away. That's cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building, say what you want about it, it's not cowardly.
      All I did was tell the truth. That's is what the whole show is about! And if Politically Incorrect (1993) has to go down for it, so be it!
      I saw this anti-drug commercial that showed a kid smoking pot in his dad's room with his friend. This kid finds a gun, the gun accidentally goes off and kills his friend. Only in America is the villain in this commercial not guns or bad parenting, but pot.
      Republicans are always saying we should privatize things like schools, prisons, social security -- hey, how about we privatize privacy! Because if the government forbids gay men from tying the knot, what is their alternative? They can't all marry Liza Minnelli.
      I'm not even sure that they [Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert] are getting at the truth. I mean, just because you're on the side of the liberals doesn't make it true. People are lazy. And I'm talking about media people too. So they're very insecure about what's the right answer, and if someone with confidence gives an answer, and it seems right and people are applauding, they all flock to it. It's a sad state of affairs when the people who are supposed to be separating truth from fiction themselves don't know what it is. It's like having a bad teacher in school. If the teacher doesn't know, then the kids can't know. And if the media isn't up to their job in delivering the news then the people are not going to be well informed.
      Religious people don't need to be ethical, because religion is mostly about salvation. It's about closing your eyes, very tightly, and believing in someone so much, without question, that when you die he will save your ass. Religion is about saving your ass. And that ain't ethical. There's a million reasons I could give you as to why a religious person is less moral than an ethicist, but here's just one. Religious people think that animals don't have a soul - we're so sure people do - so it's okay to torture and kill and do anything you want to animals because there's some bullshit in the Bible about how we have dominion over them and they don't have a soul. For that reason alone I dislike religion.
      I want America to go towards the light! God, there's so many areas where it needs to be patched up and fixed. In general, I want to see America get out of the [Iraq] war, so that we have the money and the energy to do something else. I want us, obviously, to address the environmental problems that are becoming so frightening. The frogs are dying, the bees are dying, the glaciers are melting. I don't know what has to happen before the world takes notice. And, you know, America always bragging that it is Number One. Well, if it's Number One, it's got to take the lead. And it hasn't taken the lead, so why should other countries fall in line behind us?
      We are a nation that was founded by people who were trying to get away from religious dogmatism and the authority of kings and priests. The founding documents are very vague. They talk about "the Creator" but nothing very specific - nothing at all about Jesus Christ. You'd think, if it was [to be] a Christian nation they would mention Jesus in the Constitution or the Declaration of Independence. That alone should tell you something. They [the religious right] try to take quotes out of context. Jefferson wrote that bible where he took out all "woo-woo" from Jesus; just left the philosopher. And he [Jesus] is a great philosopher. We can all admire the philosophy.
      The Founding Fathers were more deists. If you had to categorize them as anything. There was some sort of moving prime force. But it's an impersonal force. Some people call it Nature. Certainly not this personal god who you have a personal relationship with, who listens to your prayers and answers them, or doesn't. You know, not the silly stuff that most Americans believe because we're such a dumb nation.
      One thing people don't often ask me is "What do you actually believe? We know what you don't believe." I mostly preach the doctrine of "I don't know." It doesn't trouble me that much that there are big questions that I can't answer. I've never been able to answer them; I never will. I just kind of let it go. "Where did we all come from?" "What's the meaning of it all?" "What happens when you die?" Who the f-- knows? What I do know is that it gets my Irish up, to beg the point of our interview, when people make up stories and sell an invisible product. It's such a scam. I just think people should man-up, suck it up, and just say "I don't know," instead of closing their eyes very tightly and insisting on believing something that part of them must know is not true. So when people say, "Yeah, but could it be Jesus Christ?" Yes, it could be. And it could be the lint in my navel. It could be a lot of things. I tend to doubt very strongly [the story of] Jesus Christ or any other story that just smacks of the kind of thing that primitive men would come up with.
      It seems to me a very strange moment in our history to be pushing libertarianism. I said many, many years ago that I was a libertarian, like in the early '90s, and I've heard people say, "Well, Bill, you just really care about smoking pot and sex". Exactly, that's really what it was, you got me. But at this moment when BP, a private corporation, is ruining an entire ocean, when Wall Street private companies brought down an entire economy; isn't that a strange moment to be pushing for libertarianism?
      I got into some trouble with the Catholic League; not the first time, [they're] not my biggest fans; because I said in our little essay ending the show, I said, "The Pope," and I looked at it again, I looked at the words carefully, "used to be a Nazi." Okay, now first of all, it was a joke, okay? We were in a comedic context. I said, "He used to be a Nazi, and he wears funny hats, and ladies, he's single." So, right away, we're in the context of a joke, okay, and "used to." Okay, but, you know, you got me. The Pope was not a Nazi. When he was a teenager, he was in the Hitler Youth, which meant that he said the oath directly to [Adolf Hitler] and not to the Nazis, which is sort of worse! But, but wait a second, the thing that argues for their side of this is that, you know what, he was coerced into that. He was a teenager. I wouldn't blame any teen, he was a fourteen-year-old kid in Nazi Germany, of course he's going to do what they tell him to do. So, on that score, you know what my Catholic friends, I will never make the Pope is a Nazi joke again, because you're technically right, okay, and also because it distracts from the main point. And the main point I was making was that if the Pope instead of a religious figure was the CEO of a chain of nationwide daycare centers, who had thousands of employees who had been caught molesting children and then covering it up, he would have been in jail. And I noticed they didn't say a word about that!
      [To participants at the launch of the 2011-12 TV season] Thank you very much to the three people who applauded. It is really something to be back here at the job fair.
      If you think we can solve the environment with everyone recycling, you're crazy. It's like saying World War II could have been won by everyone saving tin.
      [on drug-troubled mayor Marion Barry] (He) promised to get drugs off the street, one gram at a time.
      I think people hate us around the world because they perceive that we waste what we could share. And they're not totally wrong about that. We have a holiday where we stuff food into other food... I mean, Thanksgiving is really typical of how we think about third-world indigenous people. We celebrate the one nice moment we ever had with the Indians.
      Ladies and gentlemen, on September 11 2001, America was attacked by a squad of Saudi Arabians, working out of Germany, Pakistan and Afghanistan. And by that I mean, we were attacked by Iraq.
      I'm pro-choice, I'm for assisted suicide, I'm for regular suicide, I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving - that's what I'm for. It's too crowded, the planet is too crowded and we need to promote death.
      You know they're talking about 60 votes they need. Forget this stuff. You can't get Americans to agree on anything. Sixty - percent? Sixty percent of people don't believe in evolution in this country. He just needs to drag them to it. Just drag them to this.
      [on his Johnny Carson] He was my comedy god more than any of them. Also, he's just a cool guy. When you're that age, it's the same reason you like James Bond. He has control. Girls like him. Everything I wasn't. You gotta aspire.
Sarah Palin says 'I truly believe I will see Jesus Christ return in my lifetime', to which I say 'Hasn't Jesus suffered enough?'

Birth Name: William Maher Jr.Birth Place: New York, NYDate of Birth / Zodiac Sign: 01/20/1956, CapricornProfession: Talk-show host; comedian; author
Boasting an acute wit, a mane of gray hair and an incredulous smirk that punctuates his political punch lines, Maher has made a career out of ridiculing those in power. He spent the late 1970s and early 1980s honing his comedic skills on the stand-up circuit and his tenacity paid off with supporting film and TV roles, although the projects were often pretty low-rent (D.C. Cab, House II: The Second Story). In 1993 he launched the humorous roundtable series Politically Incorrect on Comedy Central, which migrated to ABC in 1997. As the show's irreverent moderator, Maher was simultaneously charming and exasperating (but never dull) and often played devil's advocate to stir up his guests, among them big-name actors, journalists and politicians. His career hit a roadblock in 2002 when his series was canceled after he made some controversial comments about Sept. 11.  (Oddly, coming to his defense at the time, from the other end of the political spectrum, was Rush Limbaugh.) But the next year Maher returned to the small screen on HBO's Real Time With Bill Maher and the host seemed more agitated---and more liberal---than ever. (Though he has called himself a Libertarian, he admits his fans tend to be liberals.) As of early 2010, he held the record for most Emmy losses, at 22 nominations without a win.Bill Maher Fast Facts:
Began his career as a stand-up and was host at New York's top comedy club, Catch a Rising Star, which led to gigs on Johnny Carson's The Tonight Show. 
Received the L.A. Press Club's President's Award for championing free speech shortly after his Emmy-nominated Politically Incorrect was canceled by ABC. 
Penned When You Ride Alone You Ride with Bin Laden: What the Government Should Be Telling Us to Help Fight the War on Terrorism in 2002. 
In 2004, on HBO's Real Time With Bill Maher, both he and Fahrenheit 9/11 filmmaker Michael Moore got on their knees to beg Ralph Nader to drop out of the presidential race. (It didn't work.)  
A board member of PETA, he is a fan of the animal-rights organization's sometimes outrageous publicity tactics, asking USA Today, "If you don't cross the line somehow, how do you know where it is?" 
Comedy Central ranks him No. 38 among its top 100 stand-up acts.Bill Maher Relationships: Kathy Maher - SisterKarinne Steffans - Ex-significant OtherWilliam Maher Sr. - FatherJulie Maher - MotherNancy Johnson - Ex-significant OtherBill Maher Awards: 2008 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Special - Nominee2013 Emmy:  Outstanding Nonfiction Series - Nominee2006 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Special - Nominee1997 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2005 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee1996 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety or Music Program - Nominee1998 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2004 Emmy:  Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program - Nominee2010 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Special - Nominee2011 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee1997 Emmy:  Outstanding Performance in a Variety or Music Program - Nominee1996 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2010 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee1995 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee1999 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee1997 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety or Music Program - Nominee2002 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2006 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2007 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2012 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety Series - Nominee2012 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series - Nominee2013 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety Series - Nominee2007 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program - Nominee2010 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Special - Nominee2000 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2001 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2005 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program - Nominee2008 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2006 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program - Nominee2010 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2009 Emmy:  Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series - Nominee2013 Emmy:  Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series - NomineeCollege: Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (BA in English, 1978)

Nicie98: Hot or disgusting? Didn't Heather Hunter infect Magic Johnson? Poor ladies that came after her!
Heather Hunter, Karen stepens?!!!! I always took you for a head guy!!! Lol. You're a cool freakin guy! And you're pretty smart too! ;-)
Like what woman in her right mind would date him. He is smart, but a bit not very nice. He also looks like a marshmallow in person.
Very impressive list of women. Bill Maher is adorable. He`s more than just adorable but this is all I`ll post for now.
Bill, I love your show because you say what everyone else is afraid to. It`s kindof like the Emperor`s New Clothes. I am not a young chick-but a child of the 60`s who wonders what happened to our revolution? We lived on Maui`s Makena Beach for free in the early 70`s before it became a golf course. You belong to my generation and I hope to come to your show someday.
bill i really would vote for you for president why else would i spend $15 a month for HBO on my budget! I really dig you xo
Wow, from the looks of it, he certainly likes them young. Oh well, his comedy is amazing. Bill Maher!
When is real time coming back on. I was used to waking up with my coffee and Bill Meher on Sat. morning and now all I have are reruns of Becker. COOOOOMMMMMMEEEE BACKKKKKKK!!!!!!!
My neighbor has a fellowship group who speaks in tongue. Claim to speak to the ONE and yet know not what they speak. Your take on this?
This is not accurate!  There is no proof he dated Ann Coulter, and he had a serious relationship with Karrine Steffans, not an  encounter.
My 86 yr old staunch republican father told me about Bill Maher, and said Bill should run for president! I adore you, your strength, but you should really learn Yoga and educate yourself on reincarnation. Otherwise, honey, you are definitely a very bright and shining bulb. Bless your sweet self.
I happened to stumble upon this site while googling Bill Maher. I think it`s gay but since I am completely infatuated by his television personality, I just thought I`d throw my two cents out there. First of all, go him for being 52 and still getting super hot women. Secondly, I had no idea that he dated Thora Birch! I`m only four years younger than her so that means I still have a good shot too :) I should probably write a book or do something important first though.
There seems to be a gap 91-97. A dry spell perhaps? Bill, your love life is none of my business and I don`t care who you schtump. I just love you unconditionally. Keep doing what you are doing. I`m so proud of you for not selling out like Dennis Miller did, you are my hero. I used to like Dennis Miller, but now, I can`t even look at him. You stood up to the bureaucrats and those who threatened you and held on to your beliefs and look where it`s gotten you. And where is Dennis now? Probably tucked somewhere up Bushes ass..
