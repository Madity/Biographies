Stephen Gary "Steve" Wozniak[1]:18 (born August 11, 1950),[3] known as "Woz", is an American inventor, electronics engineer, and computer programmer who co-founded Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) with Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne. Wozniak single-handedly designed both the Apple I and Apple II computers in the late 1970s. These computers contributed significantly to the microcomputer revolution.[4]
The name on Wozniak's birth certificate is "Stephan Gary Wozniak", but Steve's mother said that she intended it to be spelled "Stephen", and "Steve" is what he uses.[1]:18
Wozniak has been referred to frequently by the nickname "Woz", "The Wonderful Wizard of Woz", or "The Woz".;[5] "WoZ" (short for "Wheels of Zeus") is also the name of a company Wozniak founded. In the early 1970s Wozniak was also known as "Berkeley Blue" in the phone phreak community.[6]
Wozniak was born in San Jose, California, the son of Margaret Elaine (Kern) and Jacob Francis "Jerry" Wozniak. He is of Polish ancestry on his father's side, and of German - Irish and English descent on his mother's. Wozniak's paternal grandfather was Polish as were both of his paternal grandmother's parents. His maternal grandfather was born to German immigrants and his maternal grandmother was Canadian. [7][8]
In a 2007 interview with ABC News, Wozniak recounted how and when he first met Steve Jobs: "We first met in 1971 during my college years, while he was in high school. A friend said, 'you should meet Steve Jobs, because he likes electronics and he also plays pranks.' So he introduced us." [9]
In 1973, Jobs was working for arcade game company Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, California.[10] He was assigned to create a circuit board for the arcade video game Breakout. According to Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, Atari offered $100 for each chip that was eliminated in the machine. Jobs had little specialized knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could minimize the number of chips. Wozniak reduced the number of chips by 50 by using RAM for the brick representation. Too complex to test at the time, the fact that this prototype also had no scoring or coin mechanisms meant Woz's prototype could not be used. Jobs was paid the full bonus regardless. Jobs told Wozniak that Atari gave them only $700 and that Wozniak's share was thus $350.[11] Wozniak did not learn about the actual bonus until ten years later, but said that if Jobs had told him about it and had said he needed the money, Wozniak would have given it to him.
In 1971 Wozniak's friend Bill Fernandez introduced Steve Jobs to him. At the time Fernandez and Jobs were attending Homestead High School. Jobs and Wozniak became friends when Jobs worked for the summer at Hewlett-Packard (HP), where Wozniak too was employed, working on a mainframe computer.[12] Also in 1971 Wozniak withdrew from the University of California, Berkeley, only one year after enrolling.
In 1976, Wozniak developed the computer that eventually made him famous. He alone designed the hardware, circuit board designs, and operating system for the Apple I.[13] On June 29, 1975 Wozniak tested his first working prototype, displaying a few letters and running sample programs. It was the first time in history that a character displayed on a TV screen was generated by a home computer.[1] With the Apple I design, he and Jobs were largely working to impress other members of the Palo Alto-based Homebrew Computer Club, a local group of electronics hobbyists interested in computing. The Club was one of several key centers which established the home hobbyist era, essentially creating the microcomputer industry over the next few decades. Unlike other Homebrew designs, the Apple had an easy-to-achieve video capability that drew a crowd when it was unveiled.[13]
Jobs had the idea to sell the Apple I as a fully assembled printed circuit board. Wozniak, at first skeptical, was later convinced by Jobs that even if they were not successful they could at least say to their grandkids they had had their own company. Together they sold some of their possessions (such as Wozniak's HP scientific calculator and Jobs' Volkswagen van), raised $1,300, and assembled the first boards in Jobs' bedroom and later (when there was no space left) in Jobs' garage. Wozniak's apartment in San Jose was filled with monitors, electronic devices, and some computer games Wozniak had developed.
On April 1, 1976, Jobs and Wozniak formed Apple Computer. Wozniak resigned from his job at Hewlett-Packard and became the vice president in charge of research and development at Apple. Wozniak's Apple I was similar to the Altair 8800, the first commercially available microcomputer, except the Apple I had no provision for internal expansion cards. With expansion cards the Altair could attach to a computer terminal and be programmed in BASIC. In contrast, the Apple I was a hobbyist machine. Wozniak's design included a $25 microprocessor (MOS 6502) on a single circuit board with 256 bytes of ROM, 4K or 8K bytes of RAM, and a 40-character by 24-row display controller. Apple's first computer lacked a case, power supply, keyboard, and display, components the user had to provide.
The Apple I sold for $666.66. (Wozniak later said he had no idea about the relation between the number and the mark of the beast, and "I came up with [it] because I like repeating digits.") Jobs and Wozniak sold their first 50 system boards to Paul Terrell, who was starting a new computer shop, called the Byte Shop, in Mountain View, California.[1]
After the success of the Apple I, Wozniak designed the Apple II, the first personal computer that had the ability to display color graphics, and BASIC programming language built-in.[1] During the design stage, Steve Jobs argued that the Apple II should have two expansion slots, while Wozniak wanted six. After a heated argument, during which Wozniak had threatened for Jobs to 'go get himself another computer', they decided to go with eight slots. The Apple II became one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers.
Wozniak enjoyed engineering, not management, and as other engineers joined the growing company he no longer felt needed at Apple. He did not immediately return after recovering from an airplane crash in February 1981, seeing it as a good reason to leave.[14] In May 1982 and 1983, Wozniak sponsored two US Festivals to celebrate evolving technologies; they ended up as a technology exposition and a rock festival as a combination of music, computers, television and people. In 1983 he returned to Apple product development, desiring no more of a role than that of an engineer and a motivational factor for the Apple workforce.[1]
He married Candice Clark and returned to UC Berkeley under the name "Rocky Clark" (Rocky Raccoon was his dog's name and Clark his wife's maiden name), earning his undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) in 1986.[15][16]
Wozniak permanently ended his full-time employment with Apple on February 6, 1987, 12 years after having created the company. Wozniak remains an employee of Apple and receives a stipend, estimated to be $120,000 per year.[1][17][18] He is also an Apple shareholder.[19] He also maintained connections with Steve Jobs until Jobs' death in October 2011,[20] although, in 2006, Wozniak stated that he and Jobs were not close friends.[21]
Even with the success he helped create at Apple, Wozniak felt that Apple was a hindrance to become who he wanted to be and that it was "the bane of his existence".[22] One thing he wanted to do was teach elementary school because of the important role teachers play in students' lives. Eventually, he did teach computer classes to children from the fifth through ninth grades and teachers as well.[22]
In a 2013 interview, Wozniak said that the Macintosh "failed" under Steve Jobs, and that it wasn't until Jobs left that it became a success. Jobs called the Lisa group, the team that had kicked Jobs out, idiots for making the Lisa computer too expensive. To compete with the Lisa, Jobs and his new team produced a cheaper computer, one that, according to Wozniak, was "weak", "lousy" and "still at a fairly high price". "He made it by cutting the RAM down, by forcing you to swap disks here and there", says Wozniak. He attributed the eventual success of the Macintosh to people like John Sculley "who worked to build a Macintosh market when the Apple II went away".[23]
Wozniak founded a new venture called CL 9, which developed and brought the first programmable universal remote control to market in 1987.[1] Wozniak also taught fifth-grade students.
In 2001, Wozniak founded Wheels of Zeus (WOZ), to create wireless GPS technology to "help everyday people find everyday things much more easily." In 2002, he joined the Board of Directors of Ripcord Networks, Inc., joining Ellen Hancock, Gil Amelio, Mike Connor, and Wheels of Zeus co-founder Alex Fielding, all Apple alumni, in a new telecommunications venture. Later the same year he joined the Board of Directors of Danger, Inc., the maker of the Hip Top (a.k.a. Side Kick from T-Mobile).
In 2006, Wheels of Zeus was closed, and Wozniak founded Acquicor Technology, a holding company for acquiring technology companies and developing them, with Apple alumnae Ellen Hancock and Gil Amelio.
In September 2006, Wozniak published his autobiography, iWoz: From Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer, Co-Founded Apple, and Had Fun Doing It. It was co-authored by writer Gina Smith.
In March 2006, Wozniak attended the FIRST National Competition in Atlanta to show off Lego robots.[24] In 2010, he attended another FIRST event, a regional event in downtown Phoenix Arizona at the Arizona State Fairgrounds. In 2012, he attended and was a judge at another FIRST event, the FRC Las Vegas Regional.
In February 2009, Wozniak joined Fusion-io, a data storage and server company, in Salt Lake City, Utah as their chief scientist.[26]
On November 18, 2010, Wozniak gave a speech at the Science & Technology Summit at the World Forum Convention Center in The Hague in which he predicted that Android would be dominant over the iPhone market-wise but the iPhone would retain the quality edge.[27]
On June 9, 2011, Wozniak joined members of Fusion-io’s management team to celebrate the company’s first day of trading on the NYSE by ringing The Opening Bell.[28]
On October 20, 2011, Wozniak delivered a keynote presentation entitled "Today’s Science Fiction, Tomorrow’s Science Fact" at IP EXPO, a Computer expo which took place at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in London.[29]
On November 14, 2011, Wozniak was the keynote speaker at "Rutgers Entrepreneurship Day" at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey.[30]
On May 16, 2012, Wozniak talked at the "WOZ Live" event at the Melbourne Exhibition and Convention Centre, Australia.
On October 20, 2012, Wozniak talked at the "Tijuana Innovadora" event at the Tijuana Cultural Center, in Tijuana, Mexico.[31]
Since leaving Apple, Wozniak has provided all the money, as well as a good amount of on-site technical support, for the technology program in his local school district.[1] Un.U.Son. (Unite Us In Song), an organization Wozniak formed to organize the two US Festivals, is now primarily tasked with supporting his educational and philanthropic projects.[1] In 1986, Wozniak lent his name to the Stephen G. Wozniak Achievement Awards (popularly known as Wozzie Awards), which he presented to six Bay Area high school and college students for their innovative use of computers in the fields of business, art and music. More recently, Woz was the subject of a student-made film production of his friend's (Joe Patane) nonprofit Dream Camp Foundation for high-level need youth entitled 'Camp Woz: The Admirable Lunacy of Philanthropy.'
In 1979, Wozniak was awarded the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award. In 1985, Wozniak received the National Medal of Technology (with Steve Jobs) from US President Ronald Reagan.[1] In December 1989, he received an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he studied in the late sixties.[32] Later he donated funds to create the "Woz Lab" at the University of Colorado at Boulder. In 1997, he was named a Fellow of the Computer History Museum. Wozniak was a key contributor and benefactor to the Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose; the street in front of the museum has been renamed Woz Way in his honor.[33]
In September 2000, Wozniak was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame,[34] and in 2001 he was awarded the 7th Annual Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy and Employment.[35] The American Humanist Association awarded him the Isaac Asimov Science Award in 2011.
In December 2005, Wozniak was awarded an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from Kettering University.[36] He also received honorary degrees from North Carolina State University[37] and Nova Southeastern University, and the Telluride Tech Festival Award of Technology. In May 2011, Wozniak received an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from Michigan State University.[38] In June 2012, Wozniak was awarded an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from Santa Clara University.
He was awarded the Global Award of the President of Armenia for Outstanding Contribution to Humanity Through IT in 2011.[39]
On February 17, 2014 in Los Angeles, Steve Wozniak was awarded the 66th Hoover Medal from IEEE President & CEO J. Roberto de Marca. The award is presented to an engineer whose professional achievements and personal endeavors have advanced the well-being of humankind and is administered by a board representing five engineering organizations: The American Society of Mechanical Engineers; the American Society of Civil Engineers; the American Institute of Chemical Engineers; the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers; and IEEE.
For his contributions to technology, Wozniak has been awarded a number of Honorary Doctor of Engineering degrees which include the following:
US Patent No. 4,136,359: "Microcomputer for use with video display"[40]—for which he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.
US Patent No. 4,278,972: "Digitally-controlled color signal generation means for use with display"[43]
Pirates of Silicon Valley –  a 1999 TNT film which chronicles the rise of Apple and Microsoft from 1971 to 1997. Wozniak is portrayed by Joey Slotnick.
After seeing her stand-up performance in Saratoga, California, Wozniak began dating comedian Kathy Griffin.[45] Together, they attended the 2007 Emmy Awards,[46] and he subsequently made many appearances on the fourth season of her show Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List. Woz is on the show as her date for the Producers Guild of America award show. However, on a June 19, 2008 appearance on The Howard Stern Show, Griffin confirmed that they were no longer dating and decided to remain friends.[47]
Wozniak portrays a parody of himself in the first episode of the television series Code Monkeys; he plays the owner of Gameavision before selling it to help fund Apple. He later appears again in the twelfth episode when he is in Las Vegas at the annual Video Game Convention and sees Dave and Jerry. He also appears in a parody of the "Get a Mac" ads featured in the final episode of Code Monkeys' second season. Wozniak is also interviewed and featured in the documentary Hackers Wanted and on BBC.
Wozniak competed on Season 8 of Dancing with the Stars in 2009[48][49] where he danced with Karina Smirnoff. Despite Wozniak and Smirnoff receiving 10 combined points from the three judges out of 30, the lowest score of the evening, he remained in the competition. He later posted on a social networking site that he felt that the vote count was not legitimate and suggested that the Dancing with the Stars judges had lied about the vote count to keep him on the show.[50] After being briefed on the method of judging and vote counting, he retracted and apologized for his statements.[51] Despite suffering a pulled hamstring and a fracture in his foot, Wozniak continued to compete,[52] but was eliminated from the competition on March 31, with a score of 12 out of 30 for an Argentine Tango.[53]
On September 30, 2010, he appeared as himself on The Big Bang Theory season 4 episode "The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification". While dining in The Cheesecake Factory where Penny works, he is approached by a (robot) Sheldon (which is Remote Presence on a Texai). Leonard tries to explain to Penny who Wozniak is, but she says she already knows him from Dancing with the Stars.
On September 30, 2013, he appeared along with Apple alum Daniel Kottke and Andy Hertzfeld on the television show John Wants Answers to discuss the movie Jobs.
Steve Wozniak signs a Modbook for a fan during an appearance at the Axiotron booth during Macworld Expo 2009.
He is a Freemason, despite not having faith in a supreme being (which is required by Masonic rules). Wozniak describes his impetus for joining the Freemasons as being able to spend more time with his wife at the time, Alice. Alice belonged to the Order of the Eastern Star, associated with the Masons. Wozniak has said that he quickly rose to a third degree Freemason because, whatever he does, he tries to do well. He was initiated in 1979 at Charity Lodge No. 362 in Campbell, California, now part of Mt. Moriah Lodge No. 292 in Los Gatos, California.[54]
Wozniak was married to Candice Clark from June 1981 to 1987. They have three children together, the youngest being born after their divorce was finalized.[55]
After a high-profile relationship with actress Kathy Griffin, Wozniak married Janet Hill, his current spouse.[56]
His favorite video game is Tetris.[58] In the 1990s he submitted so many high scores for the game to Nintendo Power that they would no longer print his scores, so he started sending them in under the alphabetically reversed "Evets Kainzow".[59]
On February 7, 1981, the Beechcraft Bonanza A36TC Wozniak was piloting crashed soon after takeoff from the Sky Park Airport in Scotts Valley, California.[60] The plane stalled while climbing, then bounced down the runway, went through two fences, and crashed into an embankment. Wozniak and his three passengers, then-fiance Candice Clark, her brother and his girlfriend, were injured. Wozniak sustained severe face and head injuries, including losing a tooth, and also suffered for five weeks after the crash from anterograde amnesia, the inability to create new memories. He had no memory of the crash, and did not remember his name in the hospital or the things he did after he was released from the hospital.[14][61] The National Transportation Safety Board investigation report cited premature liftoff and pilot inexperience as probable causes of the crash.[62]
In his autobiography, iWoz, Wozniak claims he regained his memory through the help of his wife, Candice Clark, logic and playing video games. After a while, he was able to establish new memories.

=======================================================
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the duo who began Apple Computer in 1976, are among the most well-known revolutionaries of the computing age. Their invention of the first true personal computer changed people's ideas of what a computer could look like and what it could do for them to make their lives easier and their work more efficient. Apple continues to be one of the best-known and most popular brands of personal computing devices in the world.
Steven Paul Jobs was born on Feb. 24, 1955, in San Francisco and adopted as an infant by a couple who raised him in Los Altos, Calif. He entered Reed College in Portland, Ore., in 1972 but dropped out after one semester to work for Atari, a maker of video games. He had become very interested in the emerging world of personal computing while still in high school, when he had begun attending lectures at Hewlett-Packard Co. where he met and befriended Wozniak.
Stephen Gary Wozniak was born on Aug. 11, 1959, in San Jose, Calif. He left the University of California at Berkeley before he finished his degree, to go to work for Hewlett-Packard. He and Jobs were very involved with a local organization called the Homebrew Computer Club where they discussed and experimented with hardware and software, including video games. It became clear to them that the personal computing era was about to heat up significantly.
Jobs became bent on starting a company of his own to build computers for individuals, and he convinced Wozniak to start it with him. They sold some of their prized belongings—for Jobs, a Volkswagen minibus and for Wozniak, a programmable HP calculator—to raise $1300 to launch the enterprise. They built their first machines in Jobs' family garage in 1976.
With Wozniaks computing and software genius combined with Jobs' marketing prowess, success came relatively quickly. They sold their first fifty machines to a dealer called the Byte Shop in Mountain View, Calif. Dubbed "Apple Is," the computers sold for $666 each. They were the first single-board computers with onboard Read Only Memory, or ROM. They also had a video interface. 
A year later, in 1977, Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II, which included color graphics and which housed its electronics inside a plastic case. Programmers began creating applications for the Apple II at Jobs' urging; soon there were more than 15,000 applications available for the machine. This, the first mass marketed personal computer, took Apple to a new realm of success. The company secured $600,000 venture funding under the management of Mike Markkula, a former Intel executive, who signed on as Apples chairman.
In 1979, Apple designed its revolutionary Lisa computer; also that year, Wozniak was issued U.S. patent No. 4,136,359 for a microcomputer. Lisa, which finally hit the marketplace until 1983, was followed by development of Macintosh, which introduced to users the now-familiar icon-rich interface navigable by computer mouse. This interface has served as a model for virtually every consumer operating system maker in the world since.
Apple Computer went public in 1980, making its founders multi-millionaires; Jobs became chairman while Markkula took on the role of president. Wozniak left Apple after a plane crash damaged his memory in 1981 (though he has remained, officially, an Apple employee to this day). Jobs, meanwhile, continued to work on product development at Apple until 1985, when he left the company amid a power struggle with its then-president and CEO John Sculley.
Jobs started a new computer products company, NeXT, in 1989, which he hoped would compete with Apple; this venture was unsuccessful in hardware but it did introduce object-oriented programming, which helps tremendously in streamlining software development processes. Jobs sold NeXT Software to Apple in 1997.  Jobs also took the helm of Pixar computer animation studios, which he purchased from George Lucas in 1986 for less than $10 million and, within a decade, had turned into a feature film-making powerhouse. The studio's first film made under his leadership, "Toy Story," was the highest grossing domestic film of 1995. Jobs continues to serve as CEO of Pixar Studios as of this 2007 writing.
Jobs also returned to Apple after a decade of absence; in 1996 he became an advisor to then-Apple chairman Gilbert F. Amelio. Jobs accepted the role of Apple chairman and CEO in 1997 and has since revitalized the company with improved products and services and the introduction of such highly successful product lines as the iPod and the MacBook. 
Wozniak, meanwhile, took a different tack, heading back to school to complete his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at U.C. Berkeley in 1987. He also became very involved in education, teaching fifth-grade students at local schools near his Silicon Valley, Calif., home and sponsoring a variety of education-focused programs in the U.S. and overseas. He consulted for Apple until 1985 and then founded CL 9, a company that developed remote control switches. In 2001, he co-founded Wheels of Zeus, or "WoZ," (which is also one of his nicknames), to create wireless GPS technology systems. WoZ closed in 2006, after which Wozniak co-founded Acquicor Technology with Gil Amelio.
Both Wozniak and Jobs have been recognized with countless awards and honors, including National Medals of Technology, awarded in 1985 by then-President Ronald Reagan. Wozniak was inducted into the Inventors Hall of Fame in 2000 and is a past recipient of the Heinz Award for Technology, The Economy and Employment. Jobs was granted the Jefferson Award for Public Service in 1987 and was named Entrepreneur of the Decade by Inc. Magazine in 1989.
=======================================================
Steve Wozniak was born in San Jose, California, in 1950. He received a B.S. in electrical engineering and computer science from UC Berkeley (1986).
Wozniak ("Woz") built his first computer when he was 13 years old, and was an electronics prodigy in high school. At 19, he met 14-year-old Steve Jobs and the two teenagers built an electronic "blue box" enabling them to hack the public telephone network and make toll-free calls.
Their next collaboration was a kit computer, designed by Wozniak, first shown at the Homebrew Computer Club in Menlo Park, California, in 1976. Called the Apple i, it was meant for hobbyists, but the two Steves received an order for 50 assembled kits from a local store, suggesting to the business-savvy Jobs that there might be a market for personal computers.
The answer was the Apple ii, another Wozniak design, which offered color graphics and came in a consumer friendly case with a built-in keyboard. Sales of the Apple ii were brisk and the newly formed Apple Computer became a large company.
Wozniak remains an Apple employee and has enjoyed a diverse career in teaching and entrepreneurship as well. In 1985, he was awarded the U.S. National Medal of Technology (with Steve Jobs).
=======================================================
Stephen Wozniak, cofounder of Apple Computers, is often given credit for starting the PC revolution.Born August 11, 1950, Wozniak built his own amateur radio station when he was 11 years old and got a ham-radio license. Two years later, he built his first computer. In the 1970's he built blue-boxes which he later sold with Steve Jobs.Having dropped out of college in 1975, Wozniak was working with a group called the Homebrew Computer Club, based in Palo Alto, CA. There, he developed a successful computer, but was working as a hobbyist. That is where he met Jobs, and the two decided that a completely assembled and inexpensive computer would be a hot item. They raised some money and built a prototype in Jobs' garage.  Named Apple I, it was a fully assembled and functional unit that contained a $25 microprocessor on a single-circuit board with ROM. On April 1, 1976, Jobs and Wozniak formed the Apple Computer Company. Wozniak quit his job at Hewlett-Packard and became the vice president in charge of research and development at Apple.  Apple I was priced at $666.66. Jobs and Wozniak sold their first 25 computers to a local dealer.  In later versions, the computer was able to display high-resolution graphics and a floppy-disk drive. Woz, as he was called by his friends, developed much of the software for the computer, as well. In 1980, the Apple company went public and made Jobs and Wozniak millionaires. In 1981, Wozniak was in a plane crash that caused him short-term memory loss.  He withdrew from his work at Apple, and went back to school, earning degrees in computer science and electrical engineering.  He went back to work at Apple, in development, but decided to leave the company for good in 1985.  That year President Ronald Reagan presented Wozniak with the National Medal of Technology.  Among other projects, he was involved in UNUSON ("Unite Us In Song"), with its goal of eliminating international enmities by using new communication devices.  In 1990 he also joined Mitchell Kapor in establishing the Electronic Frontier Foundation to provide legal aid for computer hackers facing criminal prosecution and to research the legal aspects of computer communication.In 2000, Wozniak was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.  In 2001, Woz founded Wheels Of Zeus, a company that provides wireless solutions.  Since leaving Apple Computer, Woz has provided all the money, as well as a good amount of on-site technical support at the local Los Gatos School district; among other things he volunteers his time teaching fifth-graders to use computers.   In May 2004, Woz received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from North Carolina State University for his contributions to the field of personal computing, as well as several other honorary degrees from various institutions. In 2006, Wheels of Zeus was closed and Wozniak cofounded another company, Acquicor Technology.
(born Aug. 11, 1950, San Jose, Calif., U.S.) U.S. computer engineer. He designed electronic devices and games while still in his teens. In the 1970s he worked for Hewlett-Packard. In 1976 he and Steven Jobs founded Apple Computer (incorporated in 1977; now Apple Inc.). Badly injured in a 1981 plane crash, he took a leave from Apple, but he returned to work on the revolutionary Macintosh computer. He left Apple for good in 1985, the year he was awarded the National Medal of Technology. He has since taught in elementary school.
Steve Wozniak (born 1950) invented the Apple computer and helped found the Apple Computer Company. One of the wealthiest and most famous inventors in the U.S., Wozniak left behind the world of business to spend his time teaching children about computers.Stephen Gary Wozniak was born on August 11, 1950 in San Jose, California, to Margaret Wozniak, a homemaker, and Jerry Wozniak, an electrical engineer. When he was eight, the family, including two other children, Leslie and Mark, moved to nearby Sunnyvale to be closer to his father's job at Lockheed Missiles and Space Company. Wozniak became interested in mathematics when he was in the fourth grade. The recognition and encouragement of a teacher helped to improve his self esteem. Wozniak loved to read; his favorite books were about Tom Swift, Jr., a young engineer who worked with his father inventing airplanes and rocket ships. In the fifth grade, after reading a book about a ham radio operator, Wozniak built his own radio transmitter and receiver from a kit. At 11, he built a machine he called a "ticktacktoe" computer. He also played on an all-star Little League team and ran in races. In junior high, Wozniak received a letter for swimming.At Cupertino Junior High School, Wozniak won a blue ribbon for the best electronics project at the Bay Area Science Fair. He designed a binary adding and subtracting computer. At Homestead High School, Wozniak was too advanced for the electronics and math courses. His electronics teacher sent him to Sylvania, a large electronics company, to program its computers. He won an award as the best math student at Homestead in 1966, attended seminars at the University of Santa Clara, and scored an 800 on his math Scholastic Aptitude Test.Wozniak attended the University of Colorado his freshman year of college. There he preferred skiing to studying. Because his parents could not afford the high out-of-state tuition, Wozniak returned to California to attend DeAnza Community College. For his junior year, he went to the University of California, at Berkeley. There, with the help of a high school friend named Steve Jobs, who was later to be his business partner at Apple Computer, he designed a "little blue box," a device for making illegal free telephone calls. They sold them to fellow students for $150. Wozniak, who had a talent for mimicry, said he used the box to call the Vatican, where only a sharp-eared bishop prevented him from talking to the pope by stating, "You are not Henry Kissinger."The Birth of AppleAt the end of his junior year, and short on money, Wozniak got a job at Hewlett-Packard (HP), an electronics company in Palo Alto, California. Within several months, he was a full engineer. At the center of the computer revolution, HP suited Wozniak because of its advanced technology and its laid-back atmosphere. The company allowed employees to work on their own projects at night. Doing so, Wozniak created some of the first graphics for computers and computer games. Steve Jobs, who worked at Atari, invited him to help design a spin-off of Pong called "Breakout." In four days, the two had designed it and split the $750 bonus offered by Atari. Wozniak learned many years later that Jobs had received substantially more money than he had. This discovery factored into the breakup of their friendship.Wozniak and Jobs attended meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club where the Silicon Valley engineers exchanged ideas and showed off their inventions. These meetings led Wozniak to design an inexpensive personal computer. He decided that it should be easy to program, affordable, and fun. Wozniak also started a Dial-a-Joke service, where people could call for a joke of the day. One day he talked with Alice Robertson, a woman whom he married in January 1976.Working at night at HP, Wozniak completed his computer design. When Jobs saw it, he thought it could be a commercial success and wanted to market it. While Wozniak would not leave his day job, he agreed to form a computer company with Jobs. According to Wozniak, "We never expected to make any money, but it was a chance to have a business once in our lives." Jobs came up with the name "Apple," because he had once worked in an apple orchard when he had experimented with vegetarianism in India. The Apple Computer Company was officially started on April 1, 1976. Having sold personal possessions to raise money, they decided to work in Jobs family's garage. By luck and determination, one month later they received an order for 100 computers for a total of $50,000. When he showed the computer at work, management decided that his personal computer did not match its business focus. The partners eventually sold 175 Apple I computers.Apple II A Great SuccessWhile Wozniak was still working for HP, he spent his nights improving the Apple, while Jobs figured out how to market it. Through contacts, Jobs recruited Mike Markkula, a marketing genius who had retired at age 33, to help run the company. After a short time, Wozniak's night-time efforts paid off in a much improved Apple II that was aimed at the average person rather than the electronic expert. It had sound, computer animation, high resolution images, and expanded game playing ability. The experienced Markkula wrote a business plan in which he anticipated sales of $500 million within ten years, and invested $250,000 of his own money in the venture. Finally, in October of 1976, Wozniak resigned from HP.In January of 1977, the trio incorporated Apple Computer. The company moved to larger quarters twice, recruited an ever-growing staff, and acquired an eye-catching logo-a rainbow-colored apple with a bite taken out of it. The launch of the Apple II was scheduled to coincide with the first West Coast Computer Faire. Priced at only $1,298, the computer was a great success. By the end of its first year, the company had made almost three quarters of a million dollars in sales with a profit of $42,000.At the same time that his business was taking off, Wozniak's marriage was floundering. His lack of social skills and his obsession with computers made his wife Alice feel increasingly isolated. Although they tried counseling for a year, they divorced after four years of marriage. Alice got one-third of Wozniak's Apple stock in a divorce settlement which quickly grew into a fortune.After the initial separation, Wozniak became a workaholic. During this time, he developed a way to connect the Apple computer to a printer, thereby making it more useful. He also developed the floppy disk, a removable plastic disk with information on it that can be put into the computer memory for storage or for accessing without being stored. These innovations greatly increased the ability of average people to use the Apple computer. By the end of 1978, Apple sales had increased ten times, making Apple one of the fastest growing companies in the United States. Apple computers were now stocked by more than 300 dealers. By 1979, Apple employed one thousand people.At this point, both Wozniak and Jobs were being eased out of the power structure by business people such as Markkula. Because Wozniak was so well known, he was frequently asked to give lectures and interviews with the press and television. While the Apple II was now the world's best selling computer, the company decided to plan ahead by developing the Apple III, a small business computer comparable to the IBM personal computer. Although it was priced at just under $3,000, the computer did not sell well because it experienced hardware failures, leading to bad reviews. Not much software was developed for it.Away From AppleFrustrated with Apple management, Wozniak took up flying, and started courting Candi Clark, a former Olympic kayaker and accountant at Apple. In December 1980, Apple stock went public and was sold out in minutes. Within a month, Wozniak was worth about $50 million. In February 1981, while flying Clark and other companions to Los Angeles, Wozniak crashed his plane, nearly killing everyone on board. He married Clark four months later and decided to take a leave of absence from Apple in order to return to college. Frustrations with Apple management and nearly losing his life made him reconsider his priorities. "The company had become big business, and I missed tinkering. I just wanted to be an engineer," Wozniak told People magazine.Wozniak returned to Berkeley in 1981 to earn a computer science degree under the pseudonym of "Rocky Clark," the first name from one of his dogs, and the last from his new wife. Several credits shy of graduation, he left Berkeley, but received equivalency credits for work done at Apple. Wozniak was officially awarded a degree several years later, in 1986.In 1982 and 1983, Wozniak produced two music concerts, called the US Festival, which combined the best music groups with the best computer stuff, a "hot tunes and high tech" event. Although he lost a lot of money on the festivals, he felt they were a success because both he and the concert goers had fun.Returned to Develop the MacintoshIn 1982, Wozniak returned to the Apple II section of Apple Computers. In-fighting at the company was becoming bitter. Wozniak started designing a new computer called the Lisa, a cheaper version of which was later called the Macintosh. It had a mouse, folders, and pull-down menus and displayed pictures. However, the company had lost the camaraderie Wozniak liked so much. The development of the Macintosh led to more friction between the department led by Jobs and the Apple II department. There were strained relations between Jobs and Wozniak, who was hurt that the Apple II had not received its due recognition as a computer that had a billion dollars in sales by 1982. Jobs felt that the Apple II was obsolete. In February 1985, Wozniak left Apple for good.Wozniak helped start a new company, CL9, to develop an infrared remote control device that would control household appliances. He continued to feud with Jobs, who felt betrayed because Wozniak had left Apple. When Wozniak discovered that Jobs had not evenly split the money earned from the development of the Breakout game, their relationship was further strained.In 1989, Wozniak sold the unsuccessful CL9. Since then, he has spent most of his time donating money to various charitable organizations in San Jose, including the Tech Museum of Innovation, the Children's Discovery Museum, and the San Jose-Cleveland Ballet.Wozniak and Candi Clark had three children, Jesse, Sara, and Gary; they were divorced in 1987. In 1989, he met Suzanne Mulkern, a mother of three, who shared his shyness, love of children, and sense of humor. They married in 1990. Wozniak now spends his time teaching children about the wonders of computers.Further ReadingGold, Rebecca, Steve Wozniak: A Wizard Called Woz, Lerner, 1994.Greenberg, Keith Elliot, Steven Jobs and Stephen Wozniak:Creating the Apple Computer, Blackbirch, 1994.Kendall, Martha E., Steve Wozniak: Inventor of the Apple Computer, Walker, 1994.Maclean's, May 11, 1992.People, May 30, 1983.

Stephen Gary "Steve" Wozniak[1]:18 (born August 11, 1950),[4] known as Woz, is an American inventor, computer engineer and programmer who co-founded Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) with Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne. Wozniak single-handedly invented both the Apple I and Apple II computers in the 1970s. These computers contributed significantly to the microcomputer revolution.[5]
The name on Wozniak's birth certificate is "Stephan Gary Wozniak", but Steve's mother said that she intended it to be spelled "Stephen", and "Stephen" is what he uses.[1]:18
Wozniak has been referred to frequently by the nickname "Woz" or "The Woz";[6] "WoZ" (short for "Wheels of Zeus") is also the name of a company Wozniak founded. During the early 70s, he was also known as "Berkeley Blue" in the phone phreak community.[7]
Wozniak met Steve Jobs when a fellow Homestead High School student, Bill Fernandez, introduced them to each other. In 1970, they became friends when Jobs worked for the summer at Hewlett-Packard (HP), where Wozniak was working on a mainframe computer.[8] In 1971, one year after enrolling, Wozniak withdrew from the University of California, Berkeley.
In 1976 Wozniak developed the computer that eventually made him famous. By himself he designed the hardware, circuit board designs, and operating system for the Apple I.[9] With the Apple I design, he and Jobs were largely working to impress other members of the Palo Alto-based Homebrew Computer Club, a local group of electronics hobbyists interested in computing. The Club was one of several key centers which established the home hobbyist era, essentially creating the microcomputer industry over several years. Unlike other Homebrew designs, the Apple had an easy-to-achieve video capability that drew a crowd when it was unveiled.[9]
According to Wozniak's autobiography, iWoz, Jobs had the idea to sell the Apple I as a fully assembled printed circuit board. Wozniak, at first skeptical, was later convinced by Jobs that even if they were not successful they could at least say to their grandkids they had had their own company. Together they sold some of their possessions (such as Wozniak's HP scientific calculator and Jobs' Volkswagen van), raised USD $1,300, and assembled the first boards in Jobs' bedroom and later (when there was no space left) in Jobs' garage. Wozniak's apartment in San Jose was filled with monitors, electronic devices, and some computer games Wozniak had developed.
On April 1, 1976, Jobs and Wozniak formed Apple Computer. Wozniak quit his job at Hewlett-Packard and became the vice president in charge of research and development at Apple. Wozniak's first personal computer, the Apple I, was similar to the Altair 8800, the first commercially available microcomputer, except it had no provision for internal expansion cards. With the addition of expansion cards, the Altair could be attached to a computer terminal and could be programmed in BASIC. The Apple I was purely a hobbyist machine, a $25 microprocessor (MOS 6502) on a single-circuit board with 256 bytes of ROM, 4K or 8K bytes of RAM and a 40-character by 24-row display controller. It lacked a case, power supply, keyboard, or display, which had to be provided by the user.
The Apple I was priced at $666.66. (Wozniak later said he had no idea about the relation between the number and the mark of the beast, and "I came up with [it] because I like repeating digits.") Jobs and Wozniak sold their first 50 system boards to Paul Terrell, who was starting a new computer shop, called the Byte Shop, in Mountain View, California.[1]
After the success of the Apple I, Wozniak single handedly designed the Apple II, which was the first personal computer that had the ability to display color graphics. During the designing stages, Steve Jobs argued that the Apple II should have two expansion slots, while Wozniak wanted eight of them. After a heated argument, during which Wozniak had threatened for Jobs to 'go get himself another computer', they decided to go with eight slots. The Apple II, or Apple ][, became one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. It was the first computer with a color display and had the BASIC programming language built-in.[1]
On February 7, 1981, the Beechcraft Bonanza A36TC Wozniak was piloting crashed soon after takeoff from the Sky Park Airport in Scotts Valley, California.[10] The plane stalled while climbing, then bounced down the runway, went through two fences, and crashed into an embankment. Wozniak and his three passengers, then-fiance Candice Clark, her brother and his girlfriend, were injured. Wozniak sustained severe face and head injuries, including losing a tooth, and also suffered for five weeks after the crash from anterograde amnesia, the inability to create new memories. He had no memory of the crash, and did not remember his time in hospital or the things he did after he was released from the hospital.[11] The National Transportation Safety Board investigation report cited premature liftoff and pilot inexperience as probable causes of the crash.[12]
Wozniak did not immediately return to Apple after recovering from the crash. In May 1982 and 1983, Wozniak sponsored two US Festivals to celebrate evolving technologies; they ended up as a technology exposition and a rock festival as a combination of music, computers, television and people. In 1983 he returned to Apple product development, desiring no more of a role than that of an engineer and a motivational factor for the Apple workforce.[1]
He married Candice Clark and returned to UC Berkeley under the name "Rocky Clark" (Rocky Raccoon was his dog's name and Clark his wife's maiden name), finally earning his undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) in 1986.[13]
Wozniak permanently ended his full-time employment with Apple on February 6, 1987, 12 years after having created the company. Wozniak remains an employee of Apple and receives a stipend, estimated to be USD$120k per year.[1][14][15] He is also an Apple shareholder.[16] He also maintained connections with Steve Jobs until Jobs' death in October 2011,[17] although, in 2006, Wozniak stated that he and Jobs were not close friends.[18]
Wozniak founded a new venture called CL 9, which developed and brought the first programmable universal remote control to market in 1987.[1] Wozniak also taught fifth-grade students.
In 2001, Wozniak founded Wheels of Zeus (WoZ), to create wireless GPS technology to "help everyday people find everyday things much more easily." In 2002, he joined the Board of Directors of Ripcord Networks, Inc., joining Ellen Hancock, Gil Amelio, Mike Connor, and Wheels of Zeus co-founder Alex Fielding, all Apple alumni, in a new telecommunications venture. Later the same year he joined the Board of Directors of Danger, Inc., the maker of the Hip Top (a.k.a. Side Kick from T-Mobile).
In 2006, Wheels of Zeus was closed, and Wozniak founded Acquicor Technology, a holding company for acquiring technology companies and developing them, with Apple alumni Ellen Hancock and Gil Amelio.
In September 2006, Wozniak published his autobiography, iWoz: From Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer, Co-Founded Apple, and Had Fun Doing It. It was co-authored by writer Gina Smith.
In March 2006, Wozniak attended the FIRST National Competition in Atlanta to show off Lego robots.[19] In 2010, he attended another FIRST event, a regional event in downtown Phoenix Arizona at the Arizona State Fairgrounds. In 2012, he attended and was a judge at another FIRST event, the FRC Las Vegas Regional.
In February 2009, Steve Wozniak joined Fusion-io, a data storage and server company, in Salt Lake City, Utah as their chief scientist.[20]
On November 18, 2010, Steve Wozniak gave a speech at the Science & Technology Summit at the World Forum Convention Center in The Hague in which he predicted that Android would be dominant over the iPhone market-wise but the iPhone would retain the quality edge.[21]
On June 9, 2011, Wozniak joined members of Fusion-io’s management team to celebrate the company’s first day of trading on the NYSE by ringing The Opening Bell.[22]
On October 20, 2011, Wozniak delivered a keynote presentation entitled "Today’s Science Fiction, Tomorrow’s Science Fact" at IP EXPO, a Computer expo which took place at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in London.[23]
On November 14, 2011, Steve Wozniak was the keynote speaker at "Rutgers Entrepreneurship Day" at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey.[24]
On May 16, 2012, Steve Wozniak talked at the "WOZ Live" event at the Melbourne Exhibition and Convention Centre, Australia [25]
On October 20, 2012, Steve Wozniak talked at the "Tijuana Innovadora 2012" event at the Tijuana Cultural Center, in Tijuana, Mexico[26]

Since leaving Apple, Wozniak has provided all the money, as well as a good amount of on-site technical support, for the technology program in his local school district.[1] Un.U.Son. (Unite Us In Song), an organization Wozniak formed to organize the two US Festivals, is now primarily tasked with supporting his educational and philanthropic projects.[1] In 1986, Wozniak lent his name to the Stephen G. Wozniak Achievement Awards (referred to as Wozzie Awards), which he presented to six Bay Area high school and college students for their innovative use of computers in the fields of business, art and music.
In 1979, Wozniak was awarded the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award. In 1985, Wozniak received the National Medal of Technology (with Steve Jobs) from US President Ronald Reagan.[1] In December 1989, he received an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he studied in the late sixties.[27] Later he donated funds to create the "Woz Lab" at the University of Colorado at Boulder. In 1997, he was named a Fellow of the Computer History Museum. Wozniak was a key contributor and benefactor to the Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose; the street in front of the museum has been renamed Woz Way in his honor.[28]
In September 2000, Wozniak was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame,[29] and in 2001 he was awarded the 7th Annual Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy and Employment.[30] The American Humanist Association awarded him the Isaac Asimov Science Award in 2011.
In December 2005, Wozniak was awarded an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from Kettering University.[31] He also received honorary degrees from North Carolina State University and Nova Southeastern University, and the Telluride Tech Festival Award of Technology. In May 2011, Wozniak received an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from Michigan State University.[32] In June 2012, Wozniak was awarded an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from Santa Clara University.
He was awarded the Global Award of the President of Armenia for Outstanding Contribution to Humanity Through IT in 2011.[33]
US Patent No. 4,136,359 — "Microcomputer for use with video display"[34] — for which he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.
US Patent No. 4,278,972 — "Digitally-controlled color signal generation means for use with display"[37]
After seeing her stand-up performance in Saratoga, California, Wozniak began dating comedian Kathy Griffin.[38] Together, they attended the 2007 Emmy Awards,[39] and he subsequently made many appearances on the fourth season of her show Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List. Woz is on the show as her date for the Producers Guild of America award show. However, on a June 19, 2008 appearance on The Howard Stern Show, Griffin confirmed that they were no longer dating and decided to remain friends.[40]
Wozniak portrays a parody of himself in the first episode of the television series Code Monkeys; he plays the owner of Gameavision before selling it to help fund Apple. He later appears again in the twelfth episode when he is in Las Vegas at the annual Video Game Convention and sees Dave and Jerry. He also appears in a parody of the "Get a Mac" ads featured in the final episode of Code Monkeys' second season. Wozniak is also interviewed and featured in the documentary Hackers Wanted and on BBC.
Wozniak competed on Season 8 of Dancing with the Stars in 2009[41][42] where he danced with Karina Smirnoff. Despite Wozniak and Smirnoff receiving 10 combined points from the three judges out of 30, the lowest score of the evening, he remained in the competition. He later posted on a social networking site that he felt that the vote count was not legitimate and suggested that the Dancing with the Stars judges had lied about the vote count to keep him on the show.[43] After being briefed on the method of judging and vote counting, he retracted and apologized for his statements.[44] Despite suffering a pulled hamstring and a fracture in his foot, Wozniak continued to compete,[45] but was eliminated from the competition on March 31, with a score of 12 out of 30 for an Argentine Tango.[46]
On September 30, 2010, he appeared as himself on The Big Bang Theory season 4 episode "The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification". While dining in The Cheesecake Factory where Penny works and is approached by a robot Sheldon, Leonard tries to explain to Penny who Steve is, but she says she knows him from Dancing with the Stars.
Steve Wozniak signs a Modbook for a fan during an appearance at the Axiotron booth during Macworld Expo 2009.
Wozniak was born to Francis Jacob "Jerry" Wozniak and Margaret Louise Wozniak. Wozniak's ancestry is possibly Polish on one side and German on the other, though Wozniak has said that "Either family might have come from the other country, or near the border."[47] Now Wozniak lives in Los Gatos, California.
He is also a member of the Freemasons, despite not believing in a supreme being (which is required by mason rules). Wozniak describes his impetus for joining the Freemasons as being able to spend more time with his wife at the time, Alice. Alice belonged to the Order of the Eastern Star, associated with the Masons. Wozniak has said that he quickly rose to a third degree Freemason because, whatever he does, he tries to do well. He was initiated in 1979 at Charity Lodge No. 362 in Campbell, California, now part of Mt. Moriah Lodge No. 292 in Los Gatos, California.[48]
His favorite video game is Tetris.[50] In the 1990s he submitted so many high scores for the game to Nintendo Power that they would no longer print his scores, so he started sending them in under the alphabetically reversed "Evets Kainzow".[51]

  Steven Wozniak    STEVEN WOZNIAK   by Manish Srivastava   Steve Wozniak, born 1950. Founder of Apple Computers and engineer invented one of the first computers Apple II.An industry pioneer who has been active in making computer a household word.  Education: Bachelor's of Science Computer Science, University of CaliforniaBerkley,1982.Bachelor's of Engineering Electrical Engineering, University of CaliforniaBerkley,1982. Professional Experience:       Hewlett-Packard , Engineer,.1973-1976.      Apple computers, Co-founder and vice-president of Research and development,.1976-1985.      Cl9, President, 1985-1987.      UNUSON, President, Present. Honors and Awards: 1985: National Medal of Technology , President of the United States.                      Known as the Wizard of Woz, Steve Wozniak along with Steve Jobsfounded Apple Computers Inc. and started a computer revolution that has yet to slow down.Wozniak and Jobs introduced the Apple II which was one of the first personal computersoriginally aimed at medium to large size businesses. It was responsible for the species ofsmall powerful computers that inhabit almost every part of our daily life.                As a child Steve Wozniak was enthralled with mathematics and computers.He wouldoften become so engrossed in mathematical ponderings that his mother would have tophysically shake him back to reality    . This love of mathematics drove Wozniak's ambition ,as a child, to want to become an engineer (Slater). In the mid 1970's Wozniak decidedto drop out of the University of California at Berkeley, where he was majoring inengineering, and start working for Hewlett-Packard. During this time, he startedworking with John Draper who was working on the "blue box" ,an illegal pocket-sizetelephone attachment that would allow the user to make free long-distance calls(Halliday, 205). Draper recalls that "Woz's first call was to the pope. He wanted tomake a confession." Draper and Wozniak joined other phreakers, one who endeavors tobeat the telephone system for purposes of obtaining free telephone services oreavesdropping on the conversations of others (more so the former purpose), who werereshaping circuit boards into the guts of the first personal computers. John Draper'scelebrated electronic scouting expeditions inspired these do-it-yourself technologyjunkies, eager to pull computing power out of it's climate-controlled fortresses andput it into the hands of the people (Daly). During his time at HP Woz met a summeremployee by the name of Steve Jobs and soon Jobs was helping Woz sell "blue boxes"(Halliday,205). After the "blue box" industry had run it's course Wozniak becameassociated with the Homebrew computing club and started work on the Apple I.             Wozniak, while still at HP, became in his spare time the resident geniusof a group of young computer zealots in Palo Alto California calling itself theHome-brew Computer Club. Wozniak like most of the club's members, was contentwith the joy of electronics creation. In 1975, Jobs  ,who had dropped out of ReedCollege in 1972 and then taken a spiritual journey of sorts, began attendingmeetings of the computer club. Jobs admitted that he was "nowhere near as good anengineer as Woz" but Jobs had his eye on marketability, and he persuaded Wozniakto work with him toward that goal. Wozniak and Jobs designed ,what would be theApple I, in Jobs' bedroom, and they built the prototype in Jobs' garage. Jobs'was able to convince a local electronic retailer to order twenty-five Apple Is.In order to raise the capital needed to make these machines Jobs and Wozniak hadto sell their most valuable possessions, Jobs' Volkswagen microbus and Wozniak'sHP scientific calculator, enabling them to raise $1,300. With that base capitialand credit begged from local electronics suppliers they set up their firstproduct line. Wozniak then quit Hewlett-Packard and became vice-president incharge of research and development of this new company called Apple Computers(Halliday, 205-206). The origin of Apple's name has been disputed. Some say thatit is an allusion to the Beatle's record company and others to a summer that Jobsspent picking apples in Oregon. Their company logo was an apple with a bitemissing from it referencing the computer term "byte" which is a sequence ofbinary digits operated on as a unit by a computer. One year after Apple wasestablished it introduced it's first product the Apple I. The Apple I sold at$666 and was the first single-circuit board computer with on board Read onlyMemory or ROM , which told the machine how to load other programs from anexternal source, and a built-in video interface. This model sold mainly tocomputer hobbyists and the 600 they soldgenerated $774,000 (Halliday, 206). Improving on the Apple Is without departing fromit's simplicity, Wozniak brought out the Apple II or what is now known as theVolkswagen of computers. Wozniak said that a lot of reasons that made the Apple II standout where due to agame,Breakout, which he had designed in hardware form for Atari. He had wanted to programBreakout in software. Since Wozniak had written the Basic interpreter , a program thattranslates the instruction to machine language, he was easily able to. When he got thefirst stage of Breakout working he had a ball bouncing around on the screen he then decidedto add sound so he added speakers. From there he needed paddles so he invented a minimum-chip paddle circuit. Wozniak and Randy Wigginton made a very simple disk operating systemthat would only load files from fixed locations off the disk in response to one-lettercommands. Their rudimentary control program would not be flexible enough for efficient andsimple use of the disk drive. Designing a disk operating system , DOS, was a lot of effortbecause on one side is the RAM memory in the Apple II, waiting patiently for a usefulprogram to be loaded and executed and on the other side of an electronic bridge (interfacecard and connecting cable) are the floppy disk and disk drive hardware itself. The controlprogram that Woz wrote could be compared to a narrow rope bridgecrossing a chasm; it works,but you can't carry much with you, and it is easy to lose data. Woz's "rope bridge "was afoundation, but after much work Apple came out with DOS 3.1 which completed the ground work(Wyehrich). The Apple II had built in circuitry allowing it to interface directly to acolor video monitor or a television set through add-ons. With all this technology builtinto the Apple II the only thing left to do was to introduce it and see what the worldthought.The Apple II first appeared at the West Coast Computer Faire and in the end  the color,the slots, the way in which the memory could be expanded from 4K to 48K bytes, thecontrol of the keyboard and hookup to the cassette recorder, and the BASIC that wasstored in the ROM chip, in effect the motherboard, was Wozniak's contribution(Weyhrich). In order to promote the use of Apple II Jobs challenged programmers to comeup with applications for their fledgling machine. This generated programs ranging fromGames to VisiCalc , a budget analyzer. In three years the Apple II raked in earnings of$139,000,000, not to mention that it was the best selling computer for five yearsstraight, and Apple had a growth rate of 700 percent. When Apple went public in 1980stock prices went from $22 to $29 in the first day bringing the market value of Appleto $1.2 billion. However, the Apple II Plus and Apple III didn't enjoy the samepopularity that the Apple II did and due to design flaws the Apple III had to berecalled in 1981. During this time IBM ,with it's new PC , gained a large share of theoffice trade that Apple lost [Halliday, 206]. After the Apple III failure Applereorganized and tried to remedy the Apple III failure.After the Apple III calamity the senior staff of Apple was revamped in order to tryfrom a new start. Then president at the time Michael Scott fired close to forty peoplehe was then replaced by Mike Markkula. Jobs then took over the chairmanship left vacantby Markkula[Halliday, 205-206]. Steve Wozniak was involved with several projects atApple during this time of reorganization. He had helped write some math routines for aspreadsheet product that Apple had planned to release in competition with VisiCalc.Steve Jobs had managed to convince Wozniak to participate with his new Macintoshproject. In early February Wozniak's private plane crashed and he was injured with aconcussion that temporarily made it impossible to form new memories. He couldn't recallthat he had an accident; he did not remember playing games with his computer in thehospital, he did not remember who visited him earlier in the day. When he finally didrecover from the concussion he decided it was time to take a sabbatical fromApple(Weyhrich). During this time off from Apple Wozniak needed, in some ways, to getback to his roots and so he began doing things he had wanted to do for many years.Wozniak had gone through some very difficult times and he was now looking to cometopeace with what had happened. Wozniak married and returned to college atBerkeley under the name "Rocky Clark" (a combination of his dog's name and hiswife's maiden name). He decided he wanted to finally graduate and get his degreein electrical engineering and computer science. He formed a corporation called"UNUSON" (which stood for "Unite Us In Song") a company promoting "a new kind ofunity" to produce educational computer materials, wanting to make computers easierfor students to use. He also decided to sponsor two rock music events called the"US Festival". Held on Labor Day weekend in 1982 and 1983 these music andtechnology extravaganzas were invigorating for Wozniak. Even though he lost aconsiderable amount of money on both occasions, though nowhere near drying up thevalue of his Apple Computer stock, he decided that he was ready to return to work(Weyhrich). According to News week (September 20, 1982) Wozniak wanted to go backto Apple as a regular engineer and fix a lot of motivational problems in Apple. Soin June of1983, Wozniak entered the buildingon the Apple campus where the Apple IIdivision was housed and asked for something to do (Weyhrich).During Wozniak'sleave Apple had kept on growing and had introduced many other products.In 1982 Apple sales went up 74 percent from 1981 and in January of 1983 theyannounced the Apple IIe and Lisa , the first ultra sophisticated new generation ofpersonal computers aimed at executives and employees. Lisa incorporated many featuresthat now set the standard on minicomputers today such as a 32 bit processor, ultra-sharp video display and a mouse that allowed users to produce graphics that did notneed complex keyboard entry but the price of Lisa , around $10,000, was it'sdownfall. However, it's scaled down cousin the Macintosh did survive and hasflourished since it's introduction (Halliday, 206-207). In 1985 Jobs and Wozniakreceived the National Technology Medal from PresidentReagan at the White Houseironically Wozniak decided that it was time to leave Apple and soon there after SteveJobs also left. Wozniak felt that his efforts where better suited in a morephilanthropic mode and has done much in the public sector.Wozniak has all but disappeared from public view now he decide to set up shop in astorefront office in Los Gatos California , about 15 miles south of Apple'sheadquarters in Cupertino. Wozniak left Apple almost a personal net worth of some$45 million, only to be besieged with requests for money. He recalls, "People wantedmoney to start companies, they'd send me screenplays for movies they wanted me toproduce, and there were requests from all kinds of worthy causes." Wozniak says hehas donated about $7 million to charities. After shutting the doors on CL-9 Inc.,standing for Cloud Nine a company he started in 1985 to make wireless remote controldevices for TVs and home appliances, after it shipped its first major product, CORE,which was a hand-size electronic device that allowed consumers to operate all theirhome entertainment gear remotely. Wozniak did volunteer work in Silicon Valleykindergartens, teaching local Hispanic children. It seems fitting that Wozniak, whodesigned the Apple personal computers most used by school children also wanted tobecome a teacher(Pitta). Wozniak , along with other computer industry pioneers, alsofounded the Electronic Frontier Foundation advocated the extension of the firstamendment to electronic media and was a legal defense fund for Hackers (PC week).When asked to comment on Apple Wozniak says "...Apple is not the company I had hopedit would be. I always thought that a major player in the personal computer business,with its label on the products, would be composed of top engineers and multiple labsfull of scientists developing new devices out of physics and chemistry. I onlyworked for HP and Apple. HP had lots of such labs. " but in the end Woz says " I hadtwo goals in life, to be an engineer and to teach fifth grade. For several years,I've been teaching computers tonot only teachers but also to fifth through eighthgraders." so it seems that Wozniak has fulfilled allhis goals (Winer).Steve Wozniak helped launch an industry that has come to touch the lives of almosteverybody in some way. His inventions have laid the framework for others to come andmake computer a day to day word, his Apple II set the standard for the industry.Wozniak was the typical computer "nerd" an electronic tinkered, computer gamer aswell as a math genius. If it wasn't for Woz we would not have the information age aswe have it now.  Quotation:If Apple were the Beatles, Steve Jobs would have been Paul McCartney,the commercializer and pop icon. Steve Wozniak would have been a cross between JohnLennon and Ringo Starr - a combination poet and teddy bear.  Bibliography Biographical Publications Halliday, James.
