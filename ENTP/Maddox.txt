On this page, you can find out just about everything you’d ever want to know about the Jolie-Pitt kids, including Maddox, Pax, and Zahara’s birth names, fun facts and trivia about each kid, where their names came from (if applicable) and much more!
Fun Facts and Trivia: The eldest of the Jolie-Pitt gang, Maddox has been described by his parents as being “mature”, “nurturing”, a “professional big brother”, and a “real intellectual”. He seems to exude a calm, almost zen-like quality, and seems to have adopted his parents’ stance when it comes to the paps: He may not like them, but has accepted that they’re part of his life and isn’t going to let them get to him too much. He also appears to be following in his parents’ footsteps when it comes to acting: He cameos as a zombie in his father’s hit film World War Z!
Behind His Name: Shortly after Pax was adopted, Angie revealed that her late mother Marcheline picked his name. Marcheline gave Angie and Brad a list of names she recommended when they were expecting Shiloh, and Pax was one of them. His middle name, Thien, is Vietnamese. Specifically, it is Vietnamese for “sky”, while Pax means “peace”, so Pax’s name means “peaceful sky”. 
Fun Facts and Trivia: Pax’s personality, according to his mother, is pretty much the exact opposite of his older brother’s! Angelina has described her middle son as being very wild and getting into trouble often. But at the same time, she is quick to point out that underneath that wild, rambunctious exterior is a pussy-cat like heart and that Pax is a good kid. Seemingly uncomfortable around the paps, he is often seen carrying a purple stuffed monkey when out and about!
Fun Facts and Trivia: Zahara may be only nine years old, but she has already been through perhaps more challenges in her life than all of her siblings combined! In stark contrast to the apparently very healthy girl she is today, Zahara was a very sick little baby when she was adopted at the tender age of six months. Severely underweight, dehydrated, malnourished and suffering from salmonella poisoning, she required hospitalization shortly after being brought to her new home in the U.S. …and according to the doctor that treated her, almost certainly would have died before her first birthday had it not been for Angelina. Today, luckily, all that is behind the gorgeous little girl whom Angie has described as being very maternal with her siblings. She also appears to be an animal-lover (she’s been seen minding the family’s bulldog, Jacques, and, according to her mother, takes horseback riding lessons) and quite the fashionista!
Behind Her Name: In early 2008, Angelina revealed the inspiration behind Shiloh’s first name. Shiloh Baptist was the name Angie’s parents (Marcheline Bertrand and Jon Voight) intended to give their first child. Sadly, it wasn’t meant to be, as Marcheline ended up miscarrying that baby. Angelina, however, loved the name and has even used it as an assumed name when staying at hotels. So it was only fitting that she and Brad chose the name Shiloh for their second daughter. Shiloh’s middle name, Nouvel, is thought to be in honor of architect Jean Nouvel, a favorite of Brad’s.
Trivia and Fun Facts: Angelina has described Shiloh (along with her older brother Pax) as being the J-P child most like her personality-wise- and it shows! A daredevil tomboy (Angie has jokingly said that Shiloh and Pax are “payback” for what she put her own mother through!), Shiloh doesn’t seem to care too much about what others think of her. And she is taking after her mother in one other, very important way as well: According to her father, she is deeply affected by Angie’s humanitarian work and wants to get out there and help people. Sounds like there may be another UNHCR goodwill ambassador in the J-P family in a few years!
Behind His Name: Knox was the middle name of Brad’s maternal grandfather, Hal Knox Hillhouse. Leon was apparently a name Angie and Brad just liked. “It’s a strong French name,” Brad has commented.
Trivia and Fun Facts: Like his big brothers, Knox appears to be very much a mama’s boy, often holding Angie’s hand and sticking close to her on outings. Perhaps that’s because he has the same personality as another male that likes to stick close to Angie: his father, Brad (Angie has described her youngest son as being the most like her fiancé personality-wise)! His style of dress is also very much like his father’s, and they even appear to share the same affinity for sunglasses!
Behind Her Name: Vivienne was a name that “just came to” Angie and Brad early in the pregnancy according to Brad. Marcheline is obviously a tribute to Angie’s late mother, Marcheline Bertrand. In addition, Vivienne means “live” or “alive”, so her full name quite literally means “Live Marcheline” (Angie’s mother combinded her given names of Marcia and Lynne to make Marcheline, so Marcheline has no specific meaning).
Fun Facts: Perhaps the most “girly” of the Jolie-Pitt sisters, Viv has (according to her mother) an affinity for all things pink…as well as for princesses. Fitting, then, that her first movie role is that of a princess. In her mother’s upcoming film Maleficent, she plays the child version of Princess Aurora (a.k.a., sleeping beauty). And when it comes to acting, the youngest Jolie-Pitt is “a natural” according to her proud parents! Will Maleficent mark the beginning of a long and successful career on the silver screen for Viv? Only time will tell!

Roselea Arbana "Rose" Maddox,[note 1] (August 15, 1925 – April 15, 1998), was an American country singer-songwriter and fiddle player, who was the lead singer with the Maddox Brothers and Rose before a successful solo career. Her musical styles straddled hillbilly music, rockabilly and gospel. She was noted for her "reputation as a lusty firebrand", and her "colorful Western costumes"; she was one of the earliest clients of the Hollywood tailor, Nudie Cohn.[1][2]
She was born in Boaz, Alabama, and traveled west at the age of seven with her family, who had been sharecroppers. She later said in an interview:[3]
"Cotton prices failed in Alabama. So we left for California, the Land of Milk and Honey... We only had $35 when we left there, and a dream of going to California. That was my mother's dream. Hitchhikin'. All of us. Five kids.... The brakemen helped us get on the right trains and they got us food from the caboose. Sometimes the brakemen locked us in the boxcars and told us to be quiet.... We got to Los Angeles, California, in 1933. The Salvation Army heard there was a family coming. They didn't have enough room there, so Dad and Cal slept in jail. At least it was a place to stay. We went from L.A. up to Oakland on the freights. We lived in Pipe City. There were these huge culvert pipes and all the migrants were living inside culverts. The mayor of Pipe City gave us his pipe to stay in. My mother got tired of asking for food every day. That's when we hit the front page of the Oakland Tribune as a family come west on the freights looking for work."
After her father eventually found work, the family ended up in Modesto, California.[3] Rose first performed with her brothers in amateur shows at the age of 11, and while in her teens began performing with them on local radio station KTRB.[1][4] The station offered her brothers a regular slot on condition that Rose sing with them, despite the opposition of their mother, who managed the group.[3][5] After the brothers had served in World War II, Rose first recorded with them, for Four Star Records, in 1947.[6] The group began to be successful in the late 1940s, and she and her brothers moved to live in Hollywood. They toured widely, and appeared regularly on the Louisiana Hayride radio show. Rose became noted for her colorful performances, once shocking a Grand Ole Opry audience by appearing with a bare midriff.[1] She also recorded as a duo, Rosie and Rita, with her sister-in-law.[7] Her first marriage was to E.B. Hale during the Second World War, when she was 16. She married club owner Jim Brogdon in the late 1950s; they separated after six years.[7][8]
After the Maddox Brothers group broke up in 1957, Rose initially performed with her brother Cal and then started a solo career.[4][5] She had 14 hits on the Billboard country singles chart between 1959 and 1964, including several duets with Buck Owens,[6] and also recorded with Bill Monroe.[1] Her biggest hit, "Sing a Little Song of Heartache," reached no.3 on the country chart at the end of 1962.[5] She then began to specialize in bluegrass recordings, recording the commercially successful and influential album Rose Maddox Sings Bluegrass for Capitol Records. After her contract with the company ended in 1965, she began to concentrate on tours, performing with her brothers Cal and Henry and son Donnie - who died in 1982 - in the UK, Europe and elsewhere.[5][7] She also performed regularly with bluegrass musician Vern Williams.[7]
She suffered several heart attacks from the late 1960s onwards, but continued to perform and record, for several labels.[7] In 1996, she was nominated for a Grammy award for her Arhoolie bluegrass album, $35 and a Dream. Her final album was The Moon Is Rising, also in 1996.[5]
Maddox also acted in movies including The Hi-Lo Country (1998), and the documentaries The Women of Country (1993) and Woody Guthrie: Hard Travelin' (1984).
In later years she lived in Ashland, Oregon, near where her brother had bought a ranch in 1958. She died in Ashland of kidney failure in 1998, at the age of 72.[1][5][9]
Emmylou Harris believes Maddox has never received the recognition she deserves, in part because of what Harris calls a reluctance in American society to celebrate the value of white country and roots music.[10] Dolly Parton also credits Maddox as an early influence.[11] Laura Cantrell's song "California Rose" was written in memory of Maddox.[12]
Her life story and that of the band were told in the biography, Ramblin' Rose: The Life and Career of Rose Maddox by Jonny Whiteside. The book won an award for excellence in 1998 from the Association for Recorded Sound Collections (ARSC).[13]

Angelina Jolie (/dʒoʊˈliː/ joh-LEE, born Angelina Jolie Voight; June 4, 1975) is an American actress, film director, screenwriter, and author. She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and was named Hollywood's highest-paid actress by Forbes in 2009,[2] 2011,[3] and 2013.[4] Jolie promotes humanitarian causes, and is noted for her work with refugees as a Special Envoy and former Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). She has been cited as the world's "most beautiful" woman by various media outlets, a title for which she has received substantial publicity.[5][6][7][8]
Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982), but her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993). Her first leading role in a major film was in the cyber-thriller Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical television films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999).
Jolie achieved wide fame after her portrayal of the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), and established herself among the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood with the sequel The Cradle of Life (2003).[9] She continued her action star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), Salt (2010) and The Tourist (2010)—her biggest live-action commercial successes to date with international revenues of US$478 million, $341 million, $293 million and $278 million respectively[10]—and she received further critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Jolie made her directorial debut with the wartime drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011).
Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, Jolie now lives with actor Brad Pitt, in a relationship notable for fervent media attention. Jolie and Pitt have three biological children and three adopted children.
Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor, and goddaughter of actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell. On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[11][12] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[11] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[13] although her only known indigenous ancestor was a Huron woman born in 1649.[11]
After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[14] As a child, Jolie often watched movies with her mother and explained this had inspired her interest in acting; she stated that she was not influenced by her father's career.[15] When she was six years old, her mother and stepfather, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[16] they returned to Los Angeles five years later. She then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.
At the age of 14, Jolie dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director.[17] She began working as a fashion model, modeling mainly in Los Angeles, New York, and London. During this period, she wore black clothing, experimented with knife play, and went out moshing with her live-in boyfriend.[15] Two years later, after the relationship had ended, she rented an apartment above a garage a few blocks from her mother's home.[14] She graduated from high school and returned to theater studies, though in recent times she has referred to this period with the observation, "I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos."[18]
Jolie suffered episodes of suicidal depression throughout her teens and early twenties.[17] She felt isolated at Beverly Hills High School among the children of some of the area's affluent families, as her mother survived on a more modest income, and she was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[15] She found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she started to self-harm;[19] later commenting, "I collected knives and always had certain things around. For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me."[20] She also began experimenting with drugs; by the age of 20, she had tried "just about every drug possible," including heroin.[21]
Jolie has had a difficult relationship with her father. Because of Voight's marital infidelity and the resulting breakup of her parents' marriage, she was estranged from her father for many years.[22] They reconciled and he appeared with her in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated.[14] In July 2002, Jolie—who had long used her middle name as a stage name to establish her own identity as an actress—filed a request to legally drop Voight as her surname, which was granted on September 12, 2002.[23] In August of that year, Voight claimed his daughter had "serious mental problems" on Access Hollywood.[22] In response, Jolie released a statement in which she indicated that she no longer wished to pursue a relationship with her father.[22] She explained that because she had adopted her son Maddox, she did not think it was healthy for her to associate with Voight.[24] In the wake of her mother's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007,[25] Jolie again reconciled with her father after a six-year estrangement.[26]
When she was seven years old, Jolie had a small part in Lookin' to Get Out (1982), a movie co-written by and starring her father, Jon Voight. She committed to acting at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that she was "too dark."[17] She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz's "Stand by My Woman" (1991); Antonello Venditti's version of Crowded House's hit "Don't Dream It's Over", "Alta Marea" (1991); The Lemonheads's "It's About Time" (1993); and Meat Loaf's "Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both "drama queens."[15]
Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the low-budget, straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as Casella "Cash" Reese, a near-human robot, designed to seduce her way into a rival manufacturer's headquarters and then self-detonate. Jolie was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year.[17] Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), Jolie starred as Kate "Acid Burn" Libby in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times wrote, "Kate (Angelina Jolie) stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top. Despite her sullen posturing, which is all this role requires, Ms. Jolie has the sweetly cherubic looks of her father, Jon Voight."[27] The movie failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.[28]
She next appeared in the 1996 comedy Love Is All There Is, a modern-day loose adaptation of Romeo and Juliet set among two rival Italian family restaurant owners in The Bronx, New York. In the road movie Mojave Moon (1996) she played a young woman who falls for Danny Aiello's middle-aged character, while he develops feelings for her mother, played by Anne Archer. That same year, Jolie also portrayed Margret "Legs" Sadovsky, one of five teenage girls who form an unlikely bond in the film Foxfire after they beat up a teacher who has sexually harassed them. She starred alongside actress Hedy Burress. The Los Angeles Times wrote about her performance, "It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst."[29]
In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, set in the Los Angeles underworld. The movie was not well received by critics; Roger Ebert noted that "Angelina Jolie [...] finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be Blossom's girlfriend, and maybe she is."[30] She then appeared in the television film True Women (1997), a historical romantic drama set in the American West and based on the book by Janice Woods Windle. That year, she also appeared as a stripper in the music video for "Anybody Seen My Baby?" by the Rolling Stones.
Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's George Wallace (1997). She portrayed Cornelia Wallace, the second wife of Alabama Governor George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise. The film was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. Jolie also received an Emmy Award nomination for her performance.
In 1998, Jolie starred in HBO's Gia, portraying supermodel Gia Carangi. The film chronicled the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance from Reel.com noted, "Angelina Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal—filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation—and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed."[31] For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award. She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.
In accordance with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting Gia, she told her then-husband Jonny Lee Miller that she would not be able to phone him: "I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'"[32] After Gia wrapped in 1997, Jolie announced that she had given up acting for good, because she felt that she had "nothing else to give."[33] She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she enrolled at New York University to study filmmaking and attend writing classes; she later described it as "just good for me to collect myself."[33] Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, she resumed her career.[17]
Jolie returned to film in the 1998 gangster movie Hell's Kitchen. Later that year, she appeared in Playing by Heart, part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, Ryan Phillippe, and Jon Stewart. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular. The San Francisco Chronicle wrote, "Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble."[34] Jolie won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.
In 1999, she starred in the comedy-drama Pushing Tin, alongside John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett. The film received a mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's character—Thornton's seductive wife—was particularly criticized. The Washington Post wrote, "Mary (Angelina Jolie) [is] a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home."[35] She then co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector (1999), an adaptation of a crime novel by Jeffery Deaver. Jolie played a police officer haunted by her cop father's suicide, who reluctantly helps Washington track down a serial killer. The movie grossed $151 million worldwide,[10] but was a critical failure. The Detroit Free Press concluded, "Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast."[36]
"Jolie is emerging as one of the great wild spirits of current movies, a loose cannon who somehow has deadly aim."
Jolie next took the supporting role of the sociopathic mental patient Lisa Rowe in Girl, Interrupted (1999), an adaptation of author Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name. While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie's final breakthrough in Hollywood.[38] She won her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Variety noted, "Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna's rehabilitation."[39]
In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, Gone In 60 Seconds, in which she played Sarah "Sway" Wayland, the ex-girlfriend of car thief Nicolas Cage. The role was small, and The Washington Post criticized that "all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth."[40] She later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after the emotionally heavy role of Lisa Rowe. It became her highest-grossing movie to that point, earning $237 million internationally.[10]
Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie's films to date had often not appealed to a wide audience, but Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider videogame, Jolie was required to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the title role of Lara Croft. She was generally praised for her physical performance, but the movie generated mostly negative reviews. Slant commented, "Angelina Jolie was born to play Lara Croft but [director] Simon West makes her journey into a game of Frogger."[41] The movie was an international success nonetheless, earning $275 million worldwide,[10] and launched her global reputation as a female action star.
Jolie then starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), a thriller based on the novel Waltz into Darkness by Cornell Woolrich. The film was a major critical failure, with The New York Times noting, "The story plunges more precipitously than Ms. Jolie's neckline."[42] In 2002, she starred in Life or Something Like It as an ambitious television reporter who is told that she will die in a week. The film was poorly received by critics, though Jolie's performance received positive reviews. CNN's Paul Clinton wrote, "Jolie is excellent in her role. Despite some of the ludicrous plot points in the middle of the film, this Academy Award-winning actress is exceedingly believable in her journey towards self-discovery and the true meaning of fulfilling life."[43]
Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003), which established her among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses.[9] The sequel was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156 million at the international box office.[10] She appeared in the music video for Korn's "Did My Time", which was used to promote the film. She next starred in Beyond Borders (2003), as a socialite who joins aid workers in Africa and Asia. The film reflected Jolie's real-life interest in promoting humanitarian relief, but it was critically and financially unsuccessful. The Los Angeles Times wrote, "Jolie, as she did in her Oscar-winning role in Girl, Interrupted, can bring electricity and believability to roles that have a reality she can understand. She can also, witness the Lara Croft films, do acknowledged cartoons. But the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her."[44]
In 2004, Jolie starred alongside Ethan Hawke in the thriller Taking Lives. She portrayed an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The movie received mixed reviews and The Hollywood Reporter concluded, "Angelina Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour."[45] She also provided the voice of the angelfish Lola in the DreamWorks animated movie Shark Tale (2004), and had a brief appearance in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004), a science fiction adventure film shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen. That same year, Jolie played Olympias in Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great. The film failed domestically, which director Oliver Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality,[46] but it succeeded internationally, with revenue of $139 million outside the United States.[10]
Jolie then starred opposite Brad Pitt in the 2005 action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, which tells the story of a bored married couple, John and Jane Smith, who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads. The Star Tribune noted, "While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry."[47] The movie earned $478 million worldwide, making it the seventh-highest grossing film of 2005.[48]
Jolie next appeared in Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd (2006), a film about the early history of the CIA, as seen through the eyes of Edward Wilson, an officer based on James Jesus Angleton and played by Matt Damon. Jolie played the supporting role of Margaret "Clover" Russell, Wilson's neglected wife. According to the Chicago Tribune, "Jolie ages convincingly throughout, and is blithely unconcerned with how her brittle character is coming off in terms of audience sympathy."[49]
In 2007, Jolie made her directorial debut with the documentary A Place in Time, which captures daily life in 27 locations around the world during a single week. The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival and was intended for distribution to high schools through the National Education Association.[50] Jolie then starred as Mariane Pearl in the documentary-style drama A Mighty Heart (2007). Based on Pearl's memoir of the same name, the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband, The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, in Pakistan. The Hollywood Reporter described Jolie's performance as "well-measured and moving," played "with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent."[51] Jolie was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance. She also played Grendel's mother in the animated epic Beowulf (2007), which was created through the motion capture technique.
Jolie co-starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the 2008 action movie Wanted, an adaptation of Mark Millar's graphic novel of the same name. The film received predominately favorable reviews and proved an international success, earning $342 million worldwide.[10] She also provided the voice of Master Tigress in the DreamWorks animated movie Kung Fu Panda (2008). With revenue of $632 million internationally, it became the third-highest grossing film of 2008.[52] That same year, Jolie took on the lead role in Clint Eastwood's drama Changeling.[53] Based in part on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, the film stars Jolie as Christine Collins, who is reunited with her kidnapped son in 1928 Los Angeles—only to realize the boy is an impostor. The Chicago Tribune noted, "Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm, the scenes [...] when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril."[54] Jolie received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a BAFTA Award.
Jolie next starred in the 2010 thriller Salt, her first film in two years. She starred alongside Liev Schreiber as CIA agent Evelyn Salt, who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent. Originally written as a male character, Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role to director Phillip Noyce. The film was an international success with revenues of $294 million.[10] It received mixed to positive reviews, with Jolie's performance earning praise; Empire remarked, "When it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business."[55]
She also starred opposite Johnny Depp in The Tourist (2010), which received mostly negative critical reviews. Peter Travers wrote, "Depp and Jolie hit career lows, producing the chemistry of high-fashion zombies."[56] Roger Ebert defended Jolie, stating she "does her darndest" and "plays her femme fatale with flat-out, drop-dead sexuality."[57] Despite the criticisms, after a domestic box office gross of over $67 million,[58] the film went on to gross a respectable $278 million worldwide.[10] Jolie received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance, which gave rise to speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony.[59][60] She won the 2011 Teen Choice Awards for movie actress in an action film. Jolie next reprised her voice role as Master Tigress in the animated DreamWorks sequel Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011). It became the fourth-highest grossing film of 2011,[61] and her highest-grossing film to date, earning $666 million at the international box office.[10]
In 2011, Jolie made her directorial feature debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey, a love story between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner of war, set during the 1992–95 Bosnian War. She wrote the script after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, with the aim of rekindling attention for the survivors of a war that took place in recent history.[62] To ensure a sense of authenticity, she cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia, most of whom lived through the war—including stars Goran Kostić and Zana Marjanović—and incorporated their experiences into her script. The resulting film, which she also co-produced, was released in U.S. theaters entirely in the Serbo-Croatian-Bosnian language.[63]
In the Land of Blood and Honey received mixed reviews from critics. Kenneth Turan of The Los Angeles Times criticized its "contrived plot points," but ultimately acknowledged that, as a first-time director, "Jolie accomplishes much in such a difficult area as the Bosnian war."[64] Writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis likewise criticized Jolie's script, noting the story's "somewhat awkward instructional, at times almost proselytizing aspect," but opined that, for the most part, the film "moves briskly and easily holds your attention."[65] The film won the Stanley Kramer Award from the Producers Guild of America, which honors films that highlight provocative social issues,[66] and received a nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It aroused both praise and criticism in the Balkans; the response from Bosniak war-victims advocacy organizations was "overwhelmingly positive,"[67] while a Serb war prisoners group decried the film for its alleged anti-Serb bias.[68] Sarajevo's regional government named Jolie an honorary citizen of the capital for raising awareness of the war.[69]
After a three and a half year absence from the screen, Jolie starred in the film Maleficent (2014). She played the titular role, Maleficent, the main antagonist from Disney's 1959 animated feature Sleeping Beauty. The film showed the original story from Maleficent's perspective, revealing the character's background.[70] The film received mixed reviews but Jolie's performance has been repeatedly singled out for praise.[71] The $70 million opening weekend in North America was the 3rd highest domestic opening weekend ever for a solo female star, behind only the first two Hunger Games films.[72] Dave Hollis, Walt Disney Studios' executive vice president of theatrical distribution credited Jolie with being a large part of the film's success, saying "Angelina Jolie is a very big part of the overall equation. As a star, she's a draw that transcends culture and borders and language. There's a universal nature to the intrigue she creates."[73]
She's set to direct a film about World War II hero Lou Zamperini, a former Olympic track star who survived a plane crash over sea and spent two years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. The Joel and Ethan Coen rewrote the script, based on Laura Hillenbrand's biography Unbroken.[74]
"We cannot close ourselves off to information and ignore the fact that millions of people are out there suffering. I honestly want to help. I don't believe I feel differently from other people. I think we all want justice and equality, a chance for a life with meaning. All of us would like to believe that if we were in a bad situation someone would help us."
Jolie first personally encountered the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world.[76] Upon her return home, she contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots.[75] To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.[75]
In the following months, she returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, where she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal,[77][78] the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual.[79] She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits.[75] Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001.[80]
Over the next decade, she went on field missions around the world and met with refugees and internally displaced persons in more than 30 countries.[81] In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, "Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon."[77] To that end, her 2001-02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her film Beyond Borders. She aimed to visit what she termed "forgotten emergencies," crises that media attention had shifted away from,[82] and she became noted for going "where real bullets fly,"[83] traveling to such war zones as Sudan's Darfur region during the Darfur conflict,[84] the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War,[85] where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces,[86] and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit.[83]
On April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner António Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization.[87] In her expanded role, she represents UNHCR and Guterres at the diplomatic level to facilitate lasting solutions for people displaced by major crises.[87] In the months following the promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoy—her third over all—to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees,[88] and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.[89]
In an effort to connect her Cambodian-born son with his heritage, Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003. The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province of Battambang, adjacent to a national park infiltrated with poachers who threatened the dwindling populations of Asian black bears, Asian elephants, and Indochinese tigers. She purchased the surrounding 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project.[90] In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.[91]
In 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Project (MJP)—to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals.[92] She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos,[90] where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in Western Kenya. By 2007, some 6000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.[90]
In addition to the facilities at MJP, Jolie has built at least ten other schools in Cambodia,[93] and funds the Maddox Chivan Children's Center, a care facility for children affected by HIV, in the capital Phnom Penh.[92] In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her daughter, she funds the Zahara Children's Center, which treats children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee.[94] She has also built schools elsewhere in the world, including a school and a boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in north-western Kenya,[95][96] a school for girls in Tangi, Afghanistan,[97] and another girls-only school in the Afghan capital Kabul.[98] These facilities and other projects are funded through the Jolie–Pitt Foundation, which Jolie and her partner Brad Pitt established in September 2006.[99]
Jolie became more involved in promoting humanitarian causes on a political level from 2003 onwards. She began lobbying humanitarian interests in the U.S. capital, where she had met with senators and representatives of Congress at least 20 times by 2006. She has been involved in child and women protection efforts, pushing for legislation to aid child refugees and other vulnerable children in both developing nations and the U.S.,[80] and fronting an international campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones.[100] She explained in 2006, "As much as I would love to never have to visit Washington, that's the way to move the ball."[80]
Since its founding at the 2007 Clinton Global Initiative, Jolie has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which funds education programs for children affected by disaster.[101] In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups.[101] The partnership has worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations' Center for Universal Education—founded by the partnership's co-chair, noted economist Gene Sperling—to establish education policies, which resulted in recommendations made to UN agencies, G8 development agencies, and the World Bank.[102] Jolie joined the Council on Foreign Relations in June 2007.[103]
Jolie also co-chairs Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), which provides free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S. She founded KIND in October 2008, in a collaboration with the Microsoft Corporation and 25 leading U.S. law firms.[104] She had previously, from 2005 to 2007, funded a similar initiative, the then-newly launched National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children.[105][106] In the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, she established the Jolie Legal Fellowship, whose member attorneys—the first of whom was appointed in January 2011[107]—assist and support government officials and other organizations in their efforts to secure the legal protection of Haiti's most vulnerable children.[107]
In May 2012, Jolie joined UK Foreign Secretary William Hague in a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones, the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative.[100] To highlight the problem, Jolie and Hague subsequently travelled to eastern DR Congo, where rape has been frequently used as a weapon of war by rebel groups and soldiers.[100] In 2013, she spoke at a G8 foreign ministers meeting, where ministers pledged $36 million in funding to go toward developing international standards for the investigation and prosecution of war rape,[108] and before the UN security council—the UN's most powerful body—which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date.[109]
Jolie has received wide recognition for her humanitarian work. In 2002, she received the inaugural Humanitarian Award from the Church World Service's Immigration and Refugee Program,[110] and in 2003, she was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association. She was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the UNA-USA in 2005,[111] and she received the Freedom Award by the International Rescue Committee in 2007.[112] In 2011, UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres presented Jolie with a gold pin reserved for the most long-serving staff, in recognition of her decade as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[113] In November 2013, she received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, an honorary Academy Award, from the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[114][115]
Jolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14. Her mother allowed them to live together in her home, of which Jolie later said, "I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way."[116] She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.[117]
During filming of Hackers (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the relationship in her early teens.[17] They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after on March 28, 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name in her blood.[118] Jolie and Miller separated in September 1997 and divorced on February 3, 1999. They remained on good terms, and Jolie later explained, "It comes down to timing. I think he's the greatest husband a girl could ask for. I'll always love him, we were simply too young."[119]
Jolie had a brief relationship with model-actress Jenny Shimizu on the set of Foxfire (1996). She later said, "I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her."[120] Shimizu claimed in 2005 that her relationship with Jolie had lasted many years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people.[121] In 2003, asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, "Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it's okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!"[122]
After a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They met on the set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern.[123] As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media.[124] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a son from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later. Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. Asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, "It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet."[125]
In early 2005, Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of being the reason for the divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She and Pitt were alleged to have started an affair during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005). She denied this on several occasions, but later admitted that they "fell in love" on the set.[126] She explained in 2005, "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife."[122] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when Jolie confirmed to People that she was pregnant with Pitt's child.[127] Pitt and Jolie announced their engagement in April 2012, after seven years together.[128] As a couple, they are dubbed "Brangelina" by the entertainment media, and are the subject of worldwide media coverage.[129]
On March 10, 2002, Jolie adopted her first child, seven-month-old Maddox Chivan, from an orphanage in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.[130] He was born as Rath Vibol on August 5, 2001, in a local village.[131] Jolie applied for adoption after she had visited Cambodia twice, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission. The adoption process was halted in December 2001 when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking.[132] Once the adoption was finalized, she took custody of Maddox in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003).[132] Although Jolie and her then-husband Billy Bob Thornton announced the adoption together, she in fact adopted Maddox as a single parent.[133][134]
Jolie adopted a daughter, six-month-old Zahara Marley, from an orphanage in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 6, 2005. Zahara was born as Yemsrach on January 8, 2005, in Awasa.[135] At the time of the adoption, Zahara was wrongly believed to be an AIDS orphan and it was unknown whether she herself had contracted HIV, but she later tested negative.[136] Shortly after they returned to the United States, Zahara was hospitalized for dehydration and malnutrition.[136] In November 2007, media outlets reported that Zahara's biological mother wanted her daughter back, but she denied these reports, saying she thought Zahara was "very fortunate" to have been adopted by Jolie.[135]
Jolie was accompanied by her partner Brad Pitt when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara.[137] She later indicated that she and Pitt had made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia together.[138] In December 2005, Pitt's publicist announced that Pitt was seeking to adopt Maddox and Zahara.[139] To reflect this, Jolie filed a request to legally change her children's surnames from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was granted on January 19, 2006.[140] The adoptions were finalized soon after.[141]
In an attempt to avoid the media frenzy surrounding their relationship, Jolie and Pitt went to Namibia for the birth of their first biological child. On May 27, 2006, Jolie gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in Swakopmund. Pitt confirmed that their newborn daughter would have a Namibian passport.[142] The couple decided to sell the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images themselves, rather than allowing paparazzi to make these valuable photographs. People paid a reported $4.1 million for the North American rights, while Hello! obtained the British rights for a reported $3.5 million.[143] All profits were donated to charities serving African children.[143]
On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a son, three-year-old Pax Thien, from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam.[144] He was born as Pham Quang Sang on November 29, 2003, in HCMC, where he was abandoned soon after birth.[145] Jolie adopted Pax as a single parent, because Vietnam's adoption regulations do not allow unmarried couples to co-adopt.[144] The rights for the first post-adoption images of Pax were sold to People for a reported $2 million, as well as to Hello! for an undisclosed amount.[146] In April, Jolie filed a request to legally change her son's surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was approved on May 31, 2007.[147] Pitt's adoption of Pax was finalized in the United States on February 21, 2008.[148]
At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, France, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade.[149] She gave birth to a son, Knox Léon, and a daughter, Vivienne Marcheline, on July 12, 2008.[150] The rights for the first images of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello! for a reported $14 million—the most expensive celebrity pictures ever taken. The proceeds were donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.[150]
On February 16, 2013, at the age of 37, Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene.[151] Her family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer in 2007 at the age of 56, while her maternal grandmother had ovarian cancer and died aged 45.[11][152] Her maternal aunt Debbie Martin, who had the same defective BRCA1 gene as Jolie, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004 and died at age 61 on May 26, 2013.[153][154] Jolie's mastectomy lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, and testing of the removed breast tissue showed no signs of cancerous cells.[155] On April 27, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts (transplants).[152] She reportedly intends to undergo a preventive oophorectomy (ovariectomy), as she still has a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly.[156]
"I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they have strong options."
Jolie kept news of her mastectomy private until she had completed the three-month process. On May 14, The New York Times published an op-ed titled "My Medical Choice" in which Jolie wrote about her decision and procedures, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices.[151] To that end, her treatment regimen was posted on the website of the Pink Lotus Breast Center, where she was treated.[152] In her piece—published concurrently with U.S. Supreme Court deliberations on BRCA gene patent rights held by Myriad Genetics[157]—Jolie acknowledged the largely prohibitive cost of BRCA gene testing and advocated wider accessibility.[158] On June 13, 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that isolated genes are not patentable, invalidating the BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics.[159][160]
Jolie's announcement drew extensive public attention; a Time cover story titled "The Angelina Effect" observed that Jolie brought "genetic testing in the spotlight," and noted her ability to influence people on a large scale.[161] Various public figures applauded Jolie for her decision;[162] UK foreign secretary William Hague, who visited refugee camps in Congo-Kinshasa with Jolie in March, called her "an inspiration to many."[163] Most medical experts who weighed in publicly agreed that Jolie made the right choice for herself,[164] but differed in their response to its expected influence on the public. Her decision was met with praise from health campaigners, who welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to those at risk,[163] while other experts feared a widespread overestimation of BRCA mutation occurrence,[161] as less than 1% of all women carry this genetic condition,[165] and a misunderstanding of the risks involved for those who do test positive.[161] Eric Topol, a geneticist and director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute in California, told attendees at a genetics symposium "This is the moment that will propel genomic medicine forward", saying that Jolie's announcement was "incredibly important symbolically".[166]
During the first decade of her career, Jolie—who does not employ a publicist or an agent[167]—maintained a "wild child" persona in her communication with the media. She openly discussed her love life, including her bisexuality and her interest in BDSM.[19] After she kissed her brother during the Academy Awards in 2000, their close relationship became the subject of tabloid media speculation, which she dismissed.[168] She spoke about her experiences with drugs and depression, and recalled the time, in 1997, when she almost hired a hitman to kill her, as well as the three days, just before her marriage to Billy Bob Thornton, that she was sectioned at UCLA's psychiatric ward.[17] By the mid-2000s, Jolie's involvement with the UNHCR and the adoption of her son Maddox had transformed her public image from Hollywood eccentric into humanitarian and devoted mother.[131][167]
Jolie has attracted notable media attention for her physical appearance—particularly her full lips and her many tattoos, being her most distinctive features. She has been named the world's "most beautiful" or "sexiest" woman by various media outlets, including Vogue in 2002,[5] Esquire in 2004,[169] American FHM and British Harper's Bazaar in 2005,[6][170] People and Hello! in 2006,[7][171] Empire in 2007,[172] Vanity Fair and Who in 2009,[8][173] and Allure in 2011.[174] Vanity Fair stated that 58 percent of their voters named Jolie "Most Beautiful Woman in the World," and that the competition including other celebrity women "wasn't even close."[8] Who reported that "[o]ut of all international stars, Angelina Jolie was overwhelmingly voted the world's most beautiful female."[173] Allure stated, "Angelina Jolie was named the most beautiful face around. On the surface, it's not a surprising choice: Jolie is a obviously gorgeous. But what does it say about how our views of beauty have changed?" The magazine credited society with having "branched out beyond the Barbie-doll ideal and embraced something quite different."[174] People named Jolie one of 2012's Most Beautiful at Every Age.[175]
Jolie's extensive collection of tattoos has often been addressed by interviewers. She has fourteen known tattoos, among which the Latin proverb "quod me nutrit me destruit" (what nourishes me destroys me), the Tennessee Williams quote "A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages," two sak yant designs featuring a prayer of protection and a twelve-inch-by-eight-inch tiger, and seven sets of geographical coordinates indicating the birthplaces of her children and her partner Brad Pitt.[176][177] Over time, she has covered or lasered several of her tattoos, including the name of her second husband, "Billy Bob", and the Chinese characters "死" (death) and "勇" (courage).[176]
Jolie's recognizability, influence and wealth are extensively documented. According to the Q Score, in 2000, subsequent to her Oscar win, 31% of respondents in the United States said Jolie was familiar to them; by 2006, she was familiar to 81% of Americans.[80] In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Jolie, together with partner Brad Pitt, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide.[178] She was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 2006 to 2008, and in 2011 had an endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton reportedly worth $10 million—a record for a single advertising campaign.[179] She was among the Time 100, a list of the most influential people in the world as assembled by Time, in 2006 and 2008.[180][181] Forbes named her Hollywood's highest-paid actress in 2009, 2011, and 2013, with estimated annual earnings of $27 million,[2] $30 million,[3] and $33 million respectively,[4] and she topped the magazine's Celebrity 100, a ranking of the world's most powerful celebrities, in 2009.[182]
On July 23, 2009, serving as a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie made a third trip to the Iraq War, visiting the U.S. troops stationed in 'Camp Liberty' in Baghdad's International Zone. During an interview there, she mentioned having also visited Washington, D.C.'s Walter Reed Army Medical Center: "...I was INSPIRED and reminded of all the bravery of... of all you young and, men and WOMEN...I'm always just HONOURED to spend time with, with everybody who spends time in the military...I was allowed to come and I'm privileged to be here."[183]
An unauthorized biography on Jolie by Andrew Morton was published in 2010.[184] Janet Maslin highlights the lack of sources noted in the book in a review in The New York Times, saying "the people most eager to tell him about Ms. Jolie are people who don’t know her, so that the book is shrink-wrapped in glib insights from dubious psychiatric talents".[185] Allen Barra describes it as "the worst book in the 21st century so far" in a Salon review which summarizes the book as "ill-informed, moralistic and just plain mean".[186]

Johnny Maddox (born August 4, 1927 in Gallatin, Tennessee) is a ragtime pianist, historian, and collector of musical memorabilia.
Maddox' interest in the era of ragtime was fueled by his great-aunt Zula Cothron. She had played ragtime with an all-girls' orchestra at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis and later played in vaudeville. Johnny took lessons from her initially but also studied with several locals teachers, including Lela Donoho, who had played for silent movies in Gallatin. He studied classical music for 19 years with Prudence Simpson Dresser and Patricia Neal, who once studied with Franz Liszt. Johnny played his first public concert when he was only 5 and began his professional career in 1939 playing with a local dance band, the Rhythmasters, lead by O'Donnel Templeton.
Around 1946, Maddox started working with his friend Randy Wood at Randy’s Record Shop in Gallatin when Randy launched Dot Records. His very first single, "St. Louis Tickle" with "Crazy Bone Rag" on the flip side (recorded May 19, 1950), sold over 22,000 copies in a few weeks. Maddox became the first successful artist to record for Dot Records, and his instant first success helped build the Dot into one of the most popular labels in the 1950s. Maddox's first record to sell over a million copies was probably Bob Wills's "San Antonio Rose," around 1951. Another one of his most popular early records was "In the Mood," and he performed the song on The Pee Wee King Show in February 1953.[1]
In January 1955 Maddox recorded "The Crazy Otto Medley," which was made up of several German folk songs, originally recorded by performer Fritz Schulz-Reichel under the persona Otto der Schräge. It spent 14 weeks at No. 1 and became the first million-selling all-piano record, eventually selling more than two million copies. In fact, the reference to Crazy Otto in the Grateful Dead song "Ramble on Rose" is a reference to Maddox.[2]
Maddox subsequently performed on numerous popular TV shows in the 1950s. He performed several ragtime piano solos on The Jack Paar Show in March 1955, and this episode also featured Edie Adams. In the summer of '55, he performed "The Crazy Otto Medley" on The Milton Berle Show. Maddox played "Tea for Two" with two other pianists, Hazel Scott and Joe Loco, on Patti Page's program The Big Record in November 1956. One of his later appearances was on The Soupy Sales Show.[1] Maddox continued to record for Dot Records through 1967, by which time he had earned 9 gold singles and his total sales were over 11 million. In addition, his picture hung in the main ballroom of the Hollywood Brown Derby Restaurant, in the company of Paul Whiteman, Rudy Vallee, Hank Williams, and Bill Haley.
One of the highlights of Johnny's career was performing twice at New York's famed Stork Club, where he appeared on television with Teresa Brewer. Most interestingly, he played with Swenson's Thrillcade for about 4 years. The piano was lifted off the back of a pickup truck by a hydraulic lift reaching as high as 15 feet! Johnny worked alongside and befriended many great musicians and performers during his travels. These included W.C. Handy, Sophie Tucker, Eddy Arnold, Lawrence Welk, Patsy Cline, Ted Lewis, Glenn Rowell, Joe Jordan, and Candy Candido, to name only a few.
Upon hearing him play in 1952, W.C. Handy is reported to have called Maddox "the white boy with the colored fingers."
In 1954, Maddox was voted America's Number One Jukebox Artist by the Music Operators of America (M.O.A.)
An avid collector of ragtime memorabilia, he has amassed a collection of over 30,000 records and wax cylinders, as well as a sheet music collection of over 200,000 pieces, several thousand of which he has committed to memory.

       "Not only is this a highly engaging Joyce family biography--brightly written, scrupulously researched and full of intimate, little-known Joyceana--it also gives an important thrust to a scholarly opinion now gathering force: that far from being an insignificant factor in her husband's work, Nora was the inspiration for Ulysses 's Molly Bloom . . . and principal females in all James Joyce's other writings," praised PW . Photos. Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.
  I'm a life long Joyce fan and I have to admit that I enjoyed this life of Jim's wife (only she could call him Jim!) Nora even more than I did the three volume Ellman biography of Joyce himself.  In fact, Joyce fans will  probably learn more about Joyce's writing by reading about his wife than  about him.  This is one of the most outstanding biographies I have ever  read -- it's fascinating to learn how Joyce used Nora's every utterance  somewhere in his works even though she herself never read Ulysses.
  It is hard to imagine Jim Joyce writing as he did without Nora. Her stream of consciousness letter writing influenced his style. Her feisty Aries personality gave him much impetus. Maddox likes to delve into the private lives of her subjects. Jim was much taken by Nora's earthy nature, and Maddox does not hold back in this department.This book helps explain Joyce's interest in bodily functions and the less polite side of life.Virginia Woolf said Ulysses was the work of "a queasy undergraduate scratching his pimples." After reading Maddox I would say it is the work of a pervert wallowing in a sewer. Maddox relates that Joyce, among other things, liked to watch Nora defecate. He often spent much of the night drinking and had to be carried home by a friend. I find Maddox gives too much detail about the mundane things of the Joyce's everyday life. I guess Joyce fanatics would not mind this. Nora comes across as a likeable and resourceful woman, who, despite the limitations of her background, rose to the occasion  and coped with many challenging situations.
  This book may have been interesting- I will never know. I threw it away when I saw that the whole thing was yellow and dusty. Folks with allergies cannot tolerate this sort of book.

=======================================================
Rose Maddox exerted a heavy influence on honky tonk females through her recordings with the Maddox Brothers but later turned to traditional bluegrass forms as well to inspire folk revivalists of the 1960s and '70s. Born on August 15, 1925, Maddox moved from Alabama to Modesto, CA, with her family to make a better living as farm laborers. After several years of hard work and occasional amateur musical appearances, Fred Maddox lobbied KTRB-Modesto to give a time slot to him and his brothers Cliff, Cal, Don, and Henry. The radio station agreed, but on the condition that the Maddoxes include a female singer. Rose was recruited -- as an 11 year old -- and the group soon appeared in bars as well as on the radio show. They won a contest at the California State Fair in 1939, and began to broadcast at KFBK-Sacramento, which included several stations in nearby states as part of its coverage.
World War II interrupted the career of the Maddox Brothers & Rose, with Cal, Fred, and Don entering the services. The group re-formed in the late '40s and became more popular than ever: They recorded for 4 Star and Columbia, making annual trips east to appear on the Louisiana Hayride and Grand Ole Opry. The Maddoxes' popularity was biggest on the West Coast, however; they performed on several radio shows with good music and comic hillbilly routines that appealed to the masses of dispossessed Southerners in California.
The Maddox Brothers last recorded in 1957, and Rose decided to go solo a year later with help from brothers Cal and Henry. She signed to Capitol but didn't have much success until 1961, in which she accounted for five Top 20 hits. Both "Kissing My Pillow" and its B-side "I Want to Live Again" hit the country Top 15 early in the year. "Mental Cruelty" made it to number eight in May, and her duet with Buck Owens called "Loose Talk" hit number four the same month. She ended the year with another Top 15 single, "Conscience, I'm Guilty." Her biggest hit, "Sing a Little Song of Heartache," came the following year, reaching number three in late 1962. More Top 20 singles followed in 1963, including "Lonely Teardrops," "Down to the River," "We're the Talk of the Town," "Somebody Told Somebody," and another duet with Owens, "Sweethearts in Heaven."
After hearing suggestions that her voice would be perfect for bluegrass recordings, the resulting Rose Maddox Sings Bluegrass (with Bill Monroe, Don Reno, and Red Smiley) became a big hit with folk revivalists of the mid-'60s. Maddox's Capitol contract ended in 1965, and after recording with several smaller labels, she began to concentrate on tours, with brothers Cal and Henry in addition to her son, Donnie. During the '80s, Rose suffered several heart attacks but continued to perform at folk and bluegrass festivals and record for Arhoolie, Varrick, and Takoma. Maddox spent most of the '90s relatively quietly, performing at a few festivals and recording an occasional album, including The Moon Is Rising in 1996. Maddox died of kidney failure on April 15, 1998. She was 71 years old. ~ John Bush, Rovi
