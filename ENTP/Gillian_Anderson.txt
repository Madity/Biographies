Gillian Leigh Anderson (born August 9, 1968) is an American actress. After beginning her career in theatre, Anderson achieved international recognition for her role as Special Agent Dana Scully on the American television series The X-Files. Her film work includes The House of Mirth (2000), The Mighty Celt (2005), The Last King of Scotland (2006), and two X-Files films, The X-Files (1998) and The X-Files: I Want to Believe (2008).
Anderson has received five Primetime Emmy Awards nominations winning one and five Golden Globe Awards nominations with one win.
Anderson was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Rosemary Anderson (née Lane), a computer analyst, and Homer Edward "Ed" Anderson III, who owned a film post-production company.[2][3] She has English, German, and Irish ancestry.[4] Soon after her birth, her family moved to Puerto Rico for 15 months; her family then moved to the United Kingdom where she lived until she was 11 years old. She lived for five years in Rosebery Gardens, Crouch End, London, and for 15 months in Albany Road, Stroud Green, London,[5] so that her father could attend the London Film School. She was a pupil of Coleridge Primary School. When Anderson was 11 years old, her family moved again, this time to Grand Rapids, Michigan.[6] She attended Fountain Elementary and then City High-Middle School, a program for gifted students with a strong emphasis on the humanities; she graduated in 1986.[5]
Like some other actors (notably Linda Thorson and John Barrowman) Anderson is bidialectal. With her English accent and background, Anderson was mocked and felt out of place in the American Midwest and soon adopted a Midwest accent. To this day, her accent depends on her location — for instance, in an interview with Jay Leno she spoke in an American accent, but shifted it for an interview with Michael Parkinson.[7][8][9]
Anderson was interested in marine biology,[5] but began acting her freshman year in high school productions, and later in community theater, and served as a student intern at the Grand Rapids Civic Theatre & School of Theatre Arts. She attended The Theatre School at DePaul University in Chicago (formerly the Goodman School of Drama), where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1990.[10] She also participated in the National Theatre of Great Britain's summer program at Cornell University.[5]
Anderson moved to New York when she was 22 years old.[13] To support herself when she started her career, Anderson worked as a waitress. She began her career in Alan Ayckbourn's play, Absent Friends at the Manhattan Theatre Club alongside Brenda Blethyn; she won the 1990–91 Theatre World "Newcomer" Award for her role.[5] Her next theatrical role was in Christopher Hampton's The Philanthropist at the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut.[14] Anderson moved to Los Angeles in 1992, spending a year auditioning. Although she had once vowed she would never do TV, being out of work for a year changed her mind.[15] Anderson did Home Fires Burning for a cable station, as well as the audio book version of Exit to Eden. She broke into mainstream television in 1993, with a guest appearance on the collegiate drama, Class of '96, on the fledgling Fox Network.[15]
As a result of her guest appearance in Class of 96, Anderson was sent the script for The X Files at the age of 24. She decided to audition because "for the first time in a long time, the script involved a strong, independent, intelligent woman as a lead character." Producer Chris Carter wanted to employ her, but Fox wanted someone with previous TV exposure and greater sex appeal.[16] Fox sent in more actresses, but Carter stood by Anderson, and she was eventually cast as Special Agent Dana Scully. Anderson got the part assuming it would run for 13 episodes, the standard minimum order for American TV networks. Filmed for the first five seasons in Vancouver before moving to Los Angeles, the series would run for nine seasons, and included two films, released in 1998 and 2008. During her time on The X Files, Anderson won several awards for her portrayal of Special Agent Scully, including an Emmy Award,[17] Golden Globe and two Screen Actors Guild awards for "Best Actress in a Drama Series." While filming, Anderson met assistant art director Clyde Klotz,[5] whom she would eventually marry.
In 1997 Anderson worked on the independent film Chicago Cab. In 1998 she starred in the film Playing by Heart with Sean Connery, Angelina Jolie,[15] Ellen Burstyn and Anthony Edwards. Anderson also had a supporting role in the film, The Mighty with Gena Rowlands, Harry Dean Stanton, James Gandolfini and Sharon Stone.[5]
In 1999, Anderson had a supporting role in the English-language release of Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke, where she voiced the character of Moro. Anderson is a fan of Miyazaki's work.[18] She also took part in Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues.[19]
In 2000, Anderson starred in the film The House of Mirth with Eric Stoltz, an adaptation of the Edith Wharton novel of the same name, where she won such awards as the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress, also British Independent Film Award for Best Actress and Village Voice Film Poll Best Lead Performance.[15]
When The X-Files ended, Anderson performed in several stage productions and worked on various film projects. She has participated in narrative work for documentaries on scientific topics. In 2005, she appeared as Lady Dedlock in the BBC television adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel Bleak House,[15] had a starring role in the Irish film The Mighty Celt (for which she won an IFTA award for Best International Actress) and performed in A Cock and Bull Story, a film version of the novel Tristram Shandy.[15] In 2006, Anderson was nominated for a British Academy Television Award (BAFTA) for Best Actress and won the Broadcasting Press Guild Television and Radio Award for Best Actress for her role in Bleak House.[15] Anderson also received an Emmy nomination for "Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie" for her performance as Lady Dedlock. She was nominated for a Golden Satellite Award and Golden Globe for her performance in Bleak House and came in second place in the Best Actress category of the 2005 BBC Drama website poll for her performance as Lady Dedlock (Billie Piper came in first and Anna Maxwell Martin came in third).[15]
During 2006 and 2007, Anderson appeared in two British films: The Last King of Scotland with James McAvoy[15][20] (2006) and Straightheads with Danny Dyer (2007).[21] Anderson hosted Masterpiece Theatre during the Jane Austen series.[22] From December 2007 to March 11, 2008, Anderson filmed The X-Files: I Want to Believe.[23] Anderson portrayed Nora in Ibsen's A Doll's House at the Donmar Warehouse in London's West End during a limited engagement which ran from May 14, 2009 until July 18, 2009.[24][25] Anderson had a nomination for Best Actress in the Lawrence Olivier Awards 2010, for productions which opened in the 2009 calendar year for her portrayal of Nora.[26] In April 2011 she starred in the BBC adaptation The Crimson Petal and the White as Mrs. Castaway.
Anderson appears as the head of MI7 Pamela Thornton in Johnny English Reborn, which opened internationally in Australia on September 15, 2011,[27] and to some acclaim as Miss Havisham in a three-part BBC adaptation of Great Expectations that aired in late December 2011.[28][29][30] In May 2013, Gillian Anderson appeared in the lead role in The Fall, a drama serial for BBC Two and RTÉ ONE.[31]
Anderson pregnant with her son Felix at the premiere of The X-Files: I Want to Believe, July 25, 2008
Anderson married her first husband, Clyde Klotz, The X-Files series assistant art director, on New Year's Day, 1994, in Hawaii in a Buddhist ceremony. They had a daughter, Piper Maru (born September 1994), for whom Chris Carter named the X-Files episode of the same name, and divorced in 1997.[32] In December 2004, Anderson married Julian Ozanne, a documentary filmmaker, on Lamu Island, off the coast of Kenya. Anderson announced their separation on April 21, 2006.[33] Anderson and former boyfriend, Mark Griffiths, have two sons: Oscar, born November 2006[34] and Felix, born October 2008.[35] She ended their relationship in 2012.[36] In March 2012, Anderson told Out magazine about her past relationship with a girl while in high school.[37]
In 1996, Anderson was voted the "Sexiest Woman in the World" for FHM's 100 Sexiest Women poll.[38] In 1997, she was chosen by People magazine as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in the World.[39] Askmen listed her at No. 6 on their Top 7: '90s Sex Symbols.[40] In 2008, she was listed 21st in FHM's All Time 100 Sexiest Hall of Fame.[41]
Anderson is an honorary spokesperson for the Neurofibromatosis Network.[42] Her brother Aaron died from the disease and was diagnosed when Gillian was just a teenager. She also supports Children with Tumours,[43] a new UK group devoted to helping children with NF.[44] She is also a member of the board of directors for Artists for a New South Africa and a campaigner for ACTSA: Action for Southern Africa. Anderson is an active member of PETA, and supports animal rights.[45] She also supports tribal rights charity Survival International leading to her performance in a London stage fundraiser in early 2010.[46] In late 2010, Anderson and other celebrities joined a campaign to boycott Botswana diamonds over the government's treatment of the Kalahari San.[47] On February 2011, Anderson narrated a short film about recent footage of an uncontacted tribe.[48] The Amazon Indians were spotted from the air on the Brazil-Peru border. Anderson has said, "What comes across powerfully from this amazing footage is how healthy and confident these people appear. I hope they can be left alone – but that will only happen if the loggers are stopped."[49] In June 2011, Anderson became an ambassador for Survival.[50] Anderson has also been active in the LGBT community, particularly with youth.[51] During the Fall 2013, Anderson also joined the Fishlove campaign, urging to fight unsustainable fishing practices that harm the marine ecosystem.[52]
For International Women's Day 2014, Anderson is one of the artist signatories of Amnesty International's letter to UK Prime Minister David Cameron campaigning for women's rights in Afghanistan.[53]

      [about her role as Agent Scully in The X Files (1993)] I am more spontaneous than my character . . .
      [interview in "Movieline" magazine, Dec. 1998] Fame is complicated and definitely overrated. There are perks to it that are unfathomable. But the other aspect is there's little to no privacy at all - being anywhere at any time and knowing that somebody you cannot see is probably taking a picture of you, which has happened hundreds of times. I look around and cannot see anyone and a couple of weeks later I see a photo of me looking around.
      It's easier to be myself here. I can go out wearing whatever the hell I want, no matter how ridiculous it looks. If I do that in America, people look at me like I'm insane. There are aspects of the British press which are incredibly intrusive, but then you'll go to a premiere and someone will ask permission to take a photo, and when you say, "That's enough", they'll back off. In the States, you go to a restaurant and there are people lined up outside with 8x10s of you. Or they just follow you with a video camera. I had someone deliberately rear-end my car a few years ago in L.A., and there was a video camera: they were videoing my reaction. Luckily, I was in a good mood.
      I know people who are embarrassed to be American. They don't like showing their passports. It's becoming a scary place. It takes someone very brave not to be quiet, someone who doesn't mind death threats, their life being turned upside down, news cameras outside their door. There is no freedom of speech in America anymore. They are not living up to the constitution. There's so much fear in America and control.
      My tendency is towards the opposite of health and taking care of myself. My natural tendency is destructive. In order not to act on that, I have to be careful. The minute I don't feel like that, if I let down my guard, I'm in trouble.
      I often showed up ungroomed. It didn't occur to me. Then I'd end up at a premiere and I'd think, what are you doing? I remember being at a restaurant with a famous British actress. I knew there were paparazzi outside. My intention was to make a beeline for the car. But then, as we were walking outside, she applied lipstick. I thought, what is she doing? But her public image is very glamorous. It's a different mindset.
      I don't show my face [in L.A.] very much, and so that makes it a bit more complicated for me in terms of work. They [producers] need to see you in the press, and in their face, in meetings, auditions, whatever. And as far as they're concerned, I haven't provided enough of an example of the kind of things that I can do, as an actor, for them to justify hiring me without me sitting down in front of them or having me dance around.
      I walked in thinking, it's going to be like riding a bicycle. It wasn't. It was like riding a unicycle. I'd been trying so hard to stretch myself in other roles, and to catch myself when I did anything that remotely resembles Scully, that when I was put back in the ring with her, my brain started misfiring.  in The New York Times, July 13, 2008, on how unexpectedly hard it was for her to get back in character as Scully for the movie The X Files: I Want to Believe (2008) five years after the end of the television series.]
      There are a lot of things I would have done differently, but Scully wouldn't have been one of them.
      [on The Fall (2013)] Tennison [Prime Suspect (1991)] certainly inspired my performance, in that she certainly had an ego and quite evident character flaws. It had been a long time since I'd read a script as good as this, and I was really impressed by how Allan [Allan Cubitt] gets into the psychology of his characters.

Anyone who thinks that acting in the same TV series for nine years straight might render an actress typecast needs only to look at Gillian Anderson to have a serious re-think. Although she is indisputably best known for her iconic role as FBI Special Agent Dana Scully from ‘The X-Files’ (1993), she is also an accomplished actress of the big screen and theatre.
Born in Chicago, Illinois, on 9 August 1968, Europe's year of revolutions, Anderson's mother Rosemary was a computer analyst and her father Edward Anderson owned a film post-production facility house. Very soon after Anderson was born, her parents moved to Puerto Rico, where they lived for 15 months, before relocating yet again, this time to England.Anderson spent her childhood growing up in the leafy suburbs of North London, where the family lived in Stamford Hill and Crouch End at various times, before finally settling in Haringay, where her father enrolled for a course at the London Film School. When Anderson was only 11 years old, the family moved back to America, where they settled in the town of Grand Rapids, Michigan.Anderson attended school at Fountain Elementary, then City High-Middle School, where her talent was quickly recognised, such that she received a thorough grounding in the humanities on the faculty's gifted students programme. But she was a troubled adolescent, by all accounts, and it is interesting to speculate whether she would actually have preferred to remain in England. At high school, Anderson was mocked and teased because of her English accent and she has commented in various interviews that she felt totally out of place in the American Midwest.She cemented her "outsider" status still further by dying her hair in outlandish shades, having her nose pierced, and even, at one stage, joining a punk band. Anderson's entries as "Most Bizarre", "Class Clown" and even "Most Likely To Be Arrested" in one of her high school yearbooks says it all. The tempestuous teen almost turned the last prediction into a self-fulfilling prophecy when she was apprehended on graduation night, and caught trying to jam up the doors of her high school by filling up the locks with glue.As a youngster, Anderson aspired to become a marine biologist, but this career plan was sidetracked. By a curious stroke of fate, she instead discovered the cure for her teenage angst when she enrolled in a community theatre programme and began acting at high school. Anderson subscribes to the philosophy that "everything happens for a reason", making it appropriate that the trials and tribulations of her teen years led her stormily, but inevitably, to her future love of and career in performance. Her mother Rosemary has described her utter astonishment at watching her punk rocker daughter take to Shakespeare, performing an extract from 'Romeo and Juliet', assigned as class work, with utter ease and fluency. There was no doubt in the minds of anyone watching her acting that they were witnessing a star in the making.When the acting bug took a firm hold on Anderson, her life miraculously turned around. Her grades improved, along with her attitude, and she was promptly voted "Most Improved Student". After graduating from City High School, she enrolled for acting classes at the renowned DePaul University's Goodman Theatre, where she scored a Bachelor's Degree in Fine Arts. Gillian was soon on her way, for the very next summer, she was picked to attend a workshop run by the National Theatre of Great Britain at Cornell in Ithaca, New York. Very shortly afterwards, she landed her first plum role in the off-Broadway production 'Absent Friends' in 1991, winning a Theatre World Award for her performance in this play. More stage plays followed, along with a couple of student films and a low-budget flick called 'The Turning', before Anderson decided to get serious about movie acting, relocating to L.A.
However, roles did not suddenly miraculously appear, leading to Anderson taking an audition for the TV pilot of a new Fox Network show called 'The X-Files'. She was immediately taken with the script - and what young actress wouldn't dream of playing a role like Agent Scully to David Duchovny's Agent Mulder? - but both she and Chris Carter, the show's producer, had to do some serious ducking and diving before the role was finally hers.For starters, Anderson had to lie about her age: she was still only 24, and the producers had reportedly envisioned someone older, taller, bustier, blonder and with – believe it or not – more general sex appeal for the role. Anderson took a deep breath and claimed to be 27, but even this did not open the door. However, Chris Carter was backing her appointment, knowing in his gut that she was perfect for the role, and stood firm with the producers, insisting on his choice of actress.Anderson was overjoyed to receive the news that she had finally landed the part, and flew straight to Vancouver where filming was due to start immediately. 'The X-Files' was an instant success with the viewing public, thanks to its occult, offbeat themes and wacky paranormal plotlines. Having initially thought that the series would only run to a few episodes, it soon became clear that the producers had a blockbuster of a winner on their hands. 1997 was a good year for Anderson, as she won an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actress in a Drama TV Series and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series.In 1998, 'The X-Files' made the quantum leap to the big screen with the release of 'The X-Files: Fight the Future'. In order to counter the notion that playing the same character for five years straight meant that she could not do anything else, Anderson decided to diversify her choice of acting roles. In the movie 'Chicago Cab' (2008), she played a Southside Chicago gal from the early 1920s, soon followed by 'The Mighty' (2008) in which she played a middle-aged alcoholic biker. Choosing such extraordinarily diverse roles showed all and sundry that Anderson possessed an acting talent that ranged far beyond the demands of playing Agent Scully.In 2000, Anderson achieved another triumph by becoming the first woman ever to write and direct an episode of 'The X-Files'. She then confounded the critics by starring in the period costume drama 'The House of Mirth' (2000), written and directed by Terrence Davies. Based on the novel by Edith Wharton, and set in the high society of New York in the early 1900s, Anderson played the role of Lily Bart, a young woman who falls from favour with her family, meeting a sorry end.
The film attracted great acclaim and critical success, and featured on Rolling Stone magazine's Top 10 films of 2000. She also won the British Independent Film Award for Best Actress and Best Performance Award from the Village Voice Film Critics' Poll.Meanwhile, 'The X-Files' completed its 9th and last series in May 2002, marking a major transition point in Anderson's life and career. She had always loved living in England, and soon decided to move back to London, returning her focus to acting on the stage. From autumn 2002 until February 2003, she starred in Michael Weller's play 'What The Night Is For' in London's West End. She proceeded to take on an interesting range of roles in British film productions, including the costume drama 'Bleak House' (2005), which earned her a BAFTA nomination for Best Actress, followed by 'The Last King of Scotland’ (2006) and 'Straightheads' (2007).However, Anderson's links with the science fiction franchise that helped build her career were not over yet and in 2008 she returned with 'The X-Files: I Want to Believe', the second feature film in the series following the 1998 film. Co-starring David Duchovny, Billy Connolly and Amanda Peet, the movie received mixed to negative reviews, but performed well at the box office. The same year also saw her star in the comedy 'How to Lose Friends & Alienate People', which featured Simon Pegg, Kirsten Dunst and Jeff Bridges.'Boogie Woogie', a 2009 comedy set in London, also kept Anderson busy, while 2010's 'Any Human Heart', a television adaptation broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK allowed her to work with Jim Broadbent and Matthew Macfadyen. She portrayed Wallis, Duchess of Windsor, in the production, which was also aired in the US.Anderson also landed a part in Rowan Atkinson's parody of the James Bond secret agent genre in the comedy 'Johnny English Reborn' (2011), a sequel to the 2003 film 'Johnny English'. She was also cast to appear in 'The Smell of Apples' in the same year.The year 2011 proved a busy one for the actress who also starred in period drama 'The Crimson Petal and the White' and a retelling of 'Moby Dick', which also featured William Hurt and Ethan Hawke. These roles were followed by one of her most memorable - Miss Havisham - in the BBC adaptation of the Charles Dickens's classic 'Great Expectations' over Christmas 2011.
In 2012, Anderson played the lead in TV thriller drama 'The Fall', which tells the story of two hunters, one of whom is a serial killer while the other is a detective sent to catch him, as well as in 'Shadow Dancer' with Clive Owen, which is set in 1990s Belfast.She also appeared in 'Mr Morgan's Lost Love' with Michael Caine in 2013 and will star in 'Our Robot Overlords' in 2014.Behind the camera, Anderson's private life has been spectacularly eventful and every bit as dramatic as her career. She met first husband Clyde Klotz in 1994 on the set of 'The X Files', where he was working as an assistant art director, and they were soon engaged after a whirlwind romance of only several weeks duration. Curiously, the couple were married by a Buddhist priest on the 17th hole of a golf course in Hawaii without the presence of any onlookers, although Anderson reportedly maintained that her parents were fine about not being invited! Sadly, despite the birth of their daughter Piper Maru in 1994, the marriage was short-lived, with Anderson and Klotz divorcing in 1997.Anderson subsequently coupled up with Julian Ozanne, a documentary film-maker, and the two tied the knot in a suitably romantic manner in the village of Shella on Lamu, an island off the coast of Kenya. This marriage lasted only 16 months. Since moving back to England, however, she started a relationship with a new boyfriend, businessman Mark Griffiths. Anderson gave birth to their first child, a son called Oscar, in 2006, and the couple had their second child Felix in October 2008. Unfortunately, they were divorced in 2012.For many people, Gillian Anderson will always be most fondly remembered for her groundbreaking role as FBI Agent Dana Scully, and although she would be the first to agree that fate delivered her a winning hand with that role, she clearly has talent enough to extend far beyond TV's favourite sceptic, and so we want to believe that the best is yet to come.

=======================================================
As the skeptical Scully of TV's (and now the big screen's) The X Files, Gillian Anderson is the pin-up girl of gazillions of X-philes worldwide.
Surprisingly, the sedate, doe-eyed Scully was the local riot girl during her high school years in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Anderson's English accentthe result of spending most of her childhood
in Londonwas ridiculed in small-town America.  She rebelled by becoming a punk wannabe, sometimes singing in her boyfriend's band wearing bandages and nothing else.  "I got into a
heavy punk scene," she says.  "I had a nose ring and my hair was purple and black and blue.  I dressed in black.  I was very confused, and a loner."
Anderson soon found herself on another stage, performing in community theater. She took her newfound interest to the Goodman Theatre School of Drama at Chicago's DePaul University. From there it
was offto New York, where she worked off-Broadway (when not waiting tables) before moving to Los Angeles.
But being a TV snob, Anderson found auditioning for pilots beneath her. She was finally convinced to try out for a new sci-fi show, a little something called The X Files. The no-nonsense actress had just the quality creator Chris Carter was looking for, and Gillian Anderson became Special Agent Dana Scully.
Anderson's international fame reached absurd proportionsat the height of her fame, along with the countless Web sites devoted to her, there was a Barbie doll of Anderson's Agent Scully.
Since the series ended in 2002, she's preferred to devote her talent mostly to low-key, small budget films. In 2004 she married photojournalist Julian Ozanne on Lamu's Shella island, off Kenya's Indian Ocean coast. Anderson's 10-year-old daughter from her first marriage served as her bridesmaid. Unfortunately, the second marriage went the same way as the first as she is currently separated from Ozanne.
