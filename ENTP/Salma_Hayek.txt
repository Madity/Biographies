 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          The amazing Salma Hayek was born on September 2, 1966, in the oil boomtown of Coatzacoalcos, Mexico. Hayek has freely admitted that she and her brother, Sami, were spoiled rotten by her well-to-do businessman father, Sami Hayek Dominguez, and her opera-singing mother, Diana Jiménez Medina. Her surname is from her paternal grandfather, who was Lebanese. After having seen Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) in a local movie theatre, Salma decided she wanted to become an actress. At 12, she was sent to the Academy of the Sacred Heart in New Orleans, Louisiana, where she pulled pranks on the nuns by setting their clocks back three hours. She was soon expelled. Only after attending Mexico City's Universidad Iberoamericana did she feel ready to pursue acting seriously.She soon landed the title role in Teresa (1989), a hugely successful soap opera which earned her the star status in her native Mexico. However, anxious to make films and to explore her talent and passion, Hayek left both Teresa (1989) and Mexico in 1991. Heartbroken fans spread rumors that she was having a secret affair with Mexico's president and left to escape his wife's wrath.At long last, Salma made her way to Los Angeles. The 24 year old actress approached Hollywood with naïve enthusiasm, and quickly learned that Latin actresses were, if at all, typecast as the mistress maid or local prostitute. By late 1992, Hayek had landed only bit parts. She appeared on Street Justice (1991), The Sinbad Show (1993), Nurses (1991), and as a sexy maid on the HBO series Dream On (1990). She also had one line in the Allison Anders film Mi vida loca (1993). Feeling under-appreciated by Anglo filmmakers, Hayek vented her frustrations on comedian Paul Rodriguez's late-night Spanish-language talk show in 1992.Robert Rodriguez and his producer wife Elizabeth Avellan happened to be watching and were immediately smitten with the intelligent, opinionated young woman. He soon gave her her big break--to star opposite Antonio Banderas in the now cult classic Desperado (1995), which put her on Hollywood's map. The moviegoers proved to be as dazzled with Hayek as he had been. After her break, she was cast again by Rodriguez to star in his From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). Although her vampy role opposite George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino was a small one, it was a good credit to her box office name. Hayek's first star billing came later that year with Fools Rush In (1997) opposite Friends (1994) actor Matthew Perry. The film was a modest hit, and Hayek continued to rise her star in both commercial and artistic films such as: Breaking Up (1997) with an unknown Russell Crowe; 54 (1998) about the rise and fall of the legendary New York club; Dogma (1999), playing the muse in a somewhat odd comedy co-starring Matt Damon and Chris Rock; In the Time of the Butterflies (2001), the small artistic film which won Hayek an ALMA award as best actress; and the 1999 summer blockbuster Wild Wild West (1999). Her production company "Ventanarosa" produced the 1999 Mexican feature film El coronel no tiene quien le escriba (1999), which was shown at the Cannes Film Festival and selected as Mexico's official Oscar entry for best foreign film.The new millennium started out quietly around Salma as she was preparing to produce and star in her dream role, that of Frida Kahlo, the legendary Mexican painter whom Salma had been admiring her entire life and whose story she wanted to bring to the big screen ever since her arrival in Hollywood. It finally happened in 2002. Frida (2002), co-produced by Hayek, was a beautifully made film overflowing with passion and enthusiasm, with terrific performances from Salma and Alfred Molina as Kahlo's cheating husband "Diego Rivera". On the side was an entourage of stars including Antonio Banderas, Ashley Judd, Geoffrey Rush, Edward Norton and Valeria Golino.The picture was a hit and was nominated for six Oscars, including best actress for Hayek, who became the first Latin actress to be nominated in the category, and won the awards for make-up and its brilliant original score by Elliot Goldenthal. Hayek established herself as the serious actress that she is and, in the same year, expanded her horizons, directing The Maldonado Miracle (2003), which was shown at the Sundance Film festival. In 2003, she starred in the final of Rodriguez's "Desperado" trilogy Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003), again opposite Banderas, and has just finished After the Sunset (2004) opposite Pierce Brosnan and Ask the Dust (2006) opposite Colin Farrell. Both are scheduled for release in early 2005. In the works are Robert Altman's "Paint" and Bandidas (2006) in which she will star with her friend Penélope Cruz.
          One of Hollywood's most dazzling leading actresses, Salma Hayek was born in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico, on 2nd September, 1966.Her father, Sami Hayek Dominguez, was a rich businessman, and her mother, Diana Jiménez Medina, was an opera singer. Her paternal grandfather was Lebanese. At a very young age, Salma already knew she wanted to be an actress and, after finishing high school, she felt more than ready to pursue her ambition. In the late 80s, she won the role of "Teresa" in the self-titled soap opera, and quickly became the "it" girl everyone was talking about. The shallow and superficial acting required for the role was, however, not satisfying, as she wanted to get ahead in acting rather than being stuck in it.She soon left her native Mexico and her popularity to make her way to Los Angeles. There, her career took off. Having arrived in Hollywood, she was anonymous and had to start from scratch. She soon realized she had been slightly naïve about continuing her acting career in a foreign country, with a very thick accent and no experience, whatsoever. She was told over and over again by the big suits she would have no chance of becoming a leading lady in Hollywood as there just weren't any parts for Latinas with accents, let alone one who doesn't speak English.She started to take acting classes from the renowned Stella Adler and worked on her accent. By 1993, she still wasn't getting her feet off the ground and was too stubborn to return back to Mexico as she would consider it as "having failed". Instead, she vented her frustrations in a late-night talk show by Paul Rodriguez. Director Robert Rodriguez, who happened to be watching that very show, was smitten with the beautiful, witty, and articulate Hayek, and cast her in his upcoming movie Desperado (1995).Desperado (1995) was released in 1995 and was a hit. Antonio Banderas and Hayek had ignited sparks on the screen and the moviegoers fell in love with both stars. By now, she had entered the Hollywood scene. This hadn't happened for a Latina actress since the 1930s with the success of Dolores del Rio and, later on, with Rita Moreno.In 1996, she appeared in From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) and Fled (1996) and started production on her first star billing movie, Fools Rush In (1997). The romantic comedy, which cast her as a woman who ends up pregnant after a one night stand with Matthew Perry, grossed around 35 million domestically and achieved rave reviews for Hayek. During this period, she also got to cash in on her status and looks by signing a lucrative deal with cosmetics giant Revlon.Although she had now started climbing Hollywood's A-list, the lack of good scripts, especially for women, made the young star more persevering in finding quality roles which actually demanded some acting ability. It was around this time that she felt she wanted to do a movie on the life of iconic Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. She turned down a prominent role in a $70 million movie and instead took on roles in independent films including: Breaking Up (1997), a romantic drama alongside then-newcomer Russell Crowe; The Hunchback (1997);' 54 (1998) and The Velocity of Gary* *(Not His Real Name) (1998). They were impressive but didn't do much at the box-office.In the late 1990s, Hayek went back to mainstream movies starring in Wild Wild West (1999), which grossed well over $100 million, and Dogma (1999). Her own production company, "Ventanarosa", co-produced the Mexican film El coronel no tiene quien le escriba (1999), which was shown at the Cannes film festival and submitted as an Oscar entry. At this time, Hayek had also started preparation on her upcoming Frida Kahlo film and managed to star in more movies, most notably Mike Figgis's Timecode (2000), Chain of Fools (2000), and La gran vida (2000).In late 2002, Frida (2002) was released. The hit movie provoked a great deal of publicity and rave reviews for both her and co-star Alfred Molina. When award season came the film and its star were not overlooked, winning the movie two Academy Awards and six nominations, including 'best actress' for her. After Frida came the final part in the closing trilogy of 'El Mariachi' with Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003). Again Banderas and Hayek received top billing and big box-office.With her acclaimed work in front of the screen, Hayek was offered a chance to direct a movie for Showtime called The Maldonado Miracle (2003). Not only had she established herself as a versatile actress, she was now rewarded with an Emmy as outstanding director. During this time she became one of the most photographed women in the U.S. which led to a contract with cosmetic mogul Avon, who signed her as their spokesperson for their campaigns including the Anti-Domestic Violence campaign. After an absence from the big screen for over a year, Hayek broke up with her boyfriend of four years, actor Edward Norton, and returned opposite 007 star Pierce Brosnan in an old Hollywood style action comedy After the Sunset (2004) directed by Brett Ratner.She remains one of the most hardworking actresses in Hollywood. New films include a high profile classic-style western comedy, Bandidas (2006), co-starring pal Penélope Cruz, with whom she has been friends for years. They play two bank robbers becoming Mexico's Thelma and Louise. Another of her new films is the highly anticipated Ask the Dust (2006) directed by the brilliant Robert Towne.

      I act tall!" "But look how short I am...I can't even act to be tall. I'm five-two. I can't even create the illusion that I am tall!
      "I don't believe in the so-called Latino explosion when it comes to movies. Jennifer Lopez doesn't have an accent. She grew up in New York speaking English not Spanish. Her success is very important because she represents a different culture, but it doesn't help me. I grew up in Mexico, not the US, and the fact is that there just aren't any parts for Latin actresses. I have to persuade people that my accent won't be a problem, but an asset. Everyone's afraid of doing something a bit risky. Everyone wants a $200 million hit and anything they think might get in the way of that kind of success is considered a liability".
      What worries me the most is that most men are so weak. Because of that they act like they don't care and like machos - because they are too fragile inside. They're scared of confrontation and afraid of so many things. And because of this they build up their life so they have to deal with their feelings as little as possible. I find feminine men unbelievably sexy. But most men are completely incapable of getting in touch with their feminine side. What am I supposed to talk about with a man who doesn't know what it's like to be a woman?
      What works in a relationship of very public people is not making the relationship public - keeping it as personal as it can be. It's the only way it is real. I am suspicious of those who have to let the world know how much they love each other. It's a little sad when you have to brag about how much you love someone. That kind of declaration doesn't always reflect the moment of truth between two people who care deeply for each other. When that truth is there, you don't need others to know it. And when somebody truly loves you, you don't even need him or her to be affectionate. Affection is fantastic, but it doesn't necessarily mean there's love - and the public display of affection is often just a show. When you open a door for others to have an opinion on your relationship, it can be dangerous. Find what you need, not what everyone else wants for you. Women have been taught that in order to have a place in the world, an identity, they must marry and have children. If that's the life you truly want, great. But for many women, marriage is only about needing the world to know that someone desires them enough to say, "Here's a contract to prove that I love you and will commit to you for the rest of my life." For these women, no contract equals no validation - and, thus, no reason for existing.

      If I go on a diet and work out, I'm always in a bad mood. I'd rather be a little heavier but nice.-quoted in Woman's Day 8-15-06 issue.
      In my world, you have to be so beautiful, so skinny, so rich, so famous and I don't believe you really have to be any of those things. You simply have to be who you are. I do have thighs and a butt. I have cellulite. Don't be too impressed with me. Don't try to dress like me or wear your hair like mine. Find your own style. Don't spend your savings trying to be someone else. You're not more important, smarter, or prettier because you wear a designer dress. I get them free and I'm too lazy to go out and look for my own. I, a rich girl from Mexico, came here with designer clothes. And one day, when I was starving in an apartment in Los Angeles, I looked at my Chanel blouses and said, 'If only I could pay the rent with one of these.'
      If a man lets all of my dogs sleep in the bed with us, then that is the most romantic thing. You must love my dogs in order to love me. A man who is nice to my animals and doesn't shoo them away - well, that's the height of romance.
      It sounds trite to go after men who are nice but when you've been hurt a lot it becomes appealing.
      [on being pregnant] You are like a swollen whale and never looked worse in your life. And somebody goes, 'You're glowing.' They don't have the courage to tell you how bad you look.
      You've got to take who you are and love who you are and do the best you can with what you've got. It goes for the figure, and it goes for everything else.

Her father, Sami Hayek Dominguez, who once ran for mayor of Coatzacoalcos, was either an oil company executive,[4][5][6] or the owner of an industrial-equipment firm.[7]
Her paternal grandfather was Lebanese.[8][9] She also has Spanish ancestry.[10][11][12] Her first given name, Salma, is Arabic for "peace" or "calm".[13] Raised in a wealthy, devout Roman Catholic[14] family, she was sent to the Academy of the Sacred Heart in Grand Coteau, Louisiana USA, at the age of twelve.[6] While there, she was diagnosed with dyslexia.[15] She attended university in Mexico City, where she studied International Relations at the Universidad Iberoamericana.[6]

Frida, co-produced by Hayek, was released in 2002. Starring Hayek as Frida Kahlo, and Alfred Molina as her unfaithful husband, Diego Rivera, the film was directed by Julie Taymor and featured an entourage of stars in supporting and minor roles (Valeria Golino, Ashley Judd, Edward Norton, Geoffrey Rush) and cameos (Antonio Banderas). She earned a Best Actress Academy Award nomination for her performance.[6]
In the Time of the Butterflies is a 2001 feature film based on the Julia Álvarez book of the same name, covering the lives of the Mirabal sisters. In the movie, Salma Hayek plays one of the sisters, Minerva, and Edward James Olmos plays the Dominican dictator Rafael Leónidas Trujillo whom the sisters opposed.[24]
In 2003, Hayek produced and directed The Maldonado Miracle, a Showtime movie based on the book of the same name, winning her a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing in a Children/Youth/Family Special.[25] In December 2005, she directed a music video for Prince, titled "Te Amo Corazon" ("I love you, sweetheart") that featured Mía Maestro.[26]
Hayek was an executive producer of Ugly Betty, a television series that aired around the world from 2006 to 2010. Hayek adapted the series for American television with Ben Silverman, who acquired the rights and scripts from the Colombian telenovela Yo Soy Betty La Fea in 2001. Originally intended as a half hour sitcom for NBC in 2004, the project would later be picked up by ABC for the 2006–2007 season with Silvio Horta also producing.

In July 2011 Hayek's husband was named in a paternity case. According to reports, Pinault is the father of supermodel, Linda Evangelista's four-year-old son, Augustin James. He denied all allegations,[52][53] although the reports were later substantiated.[54]
Hayek's charitable work includes increasing awareness on violence against women and discrimination against immigrants.[55] On July 19, 2005, Hayek testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary supporting reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act.[56] In February 2006, she donated $25,000 to a Coatzacoalcos, Mexico, shelter for battered women and another $50,000 to Monterrey based anti-domestic violence groups.[57] Hayek is a board member of V-Day, the charity founded by playwright Eve Ensler.

                From 'Dusk Till Dawn' this beautiful actress is a pin-up around the world and her lap dance in Dogma is truly serendipitousSalma Hayek had a privileged upbringing in Mexico thanks to her Lebanese businessman father and her Mexican born opera singing mother. Having landed a role in the hugely popular Mexican TV soap opera, ‘Teresa’, she became an instant celebrity in her home country. However, her fans were soon to be heartbroken when she left both the soap and Mexico in 1991 to move to L.A. While establishing herself in Hollywood, she cropped up in ‘Dream On’ and ‘Mi Vida Loca’. However, a chance outburst on a late night talk show landed her a role opposite Antonio Banderas in ‘Desperado’. Subsequent outings in ‘From Dusk Till Dawn’, ‘Fools Rush In’ and ‘Breaking Up’ helped the young actress carve herself a name in the industry. Salma was quick to capitalise on her success and set up her own production company which went on to make ‘No One Writes to the Colonel’ - Mexico's official Oscar entry for best foreign film. Salma’s next big project was a film about Frida Kahlo, the Mexican painter whom she had long since admired. In 2002, ‘Frida’, co-produced by Hayek, was nominated for 6 Oscars including best actress for Hayek, the first Latin actress to be nominated in the category. With an impressive filmography under her belt, Salma Hayek is one of Hollywood’s true glamour stars.  In 2003, Hayek turned her hand to producing and directing with the showtime movie The Maldonado Miracle, winning a Daytime Emmy Award for outstanding directing in a youth/children/family special.  She went on to direct a music video for Prince in 2005 for his track Te Amo Corazon.  Hayek worked as an executive producer on the popular sitcom Ugly Betty. In addition, she made a guest appearance in the show as Sofia Reyes and won an Emmy nomination for the role.  In 2007, the actress announced her engagement to billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault, revealing at the same time that she was pregnant with her first child.  The couple's daughter Valentina Paloma Pinault was born in Los Angeles in September of that year. Hayek and Pinalt married in 2009 in Paris, also holding a second ceremony in Venice.  In 2010, Hayek appeared in the film Grown Ups, alongside Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Kevin James and Rob Schneider. Although the film was panned by critics it was a success at the box office, generating more than $271 million in gross revenue.

Salma Hayek, who recently celebrated her 47th birthday, looks as gorgeous or even more so than she did in her 20s, when she made her acting debut in her home country of Mexico.
Her first roles were in Spanish-language telenovelas. While she had previously held small roles in other soap operas, it was her leading role in the Mexican soap “Teresa” that turned Hayek into an overnight success.
Once in the U.S., Hayek was featured in “Desperado” alongside Antonio Banderas and “Wild Wild West” costarring with Will Smith and Kevin Kline. But her big break came in 2002 with the film “Frida,” in which she gave life to Mexican artist Frida Kahlo.
Throughout her career she has won many awards including a Screen Actor’s Guild Award and a Daytime Emmy.
Hayek is the mother to five-year-old Valentina Paloma and wife to French billionaire Francois Henri Pinault. Her latest films include “Savages,” “Grown Ups” and “Grown Ups II.”
When Hayek is not busy filming, she likes watching Mexican soccer, practicing Krav Maga (the official self defense system of the Israeli military) and spending time with little Valentina.

Hispanic Culture | Latino Culture | Latin American CultureHispanic Culture Online your place to connect with your Latino heritage, is a place to feel inspired, and to find the best of our Hispanic products.
Reflected in any Salma Hayek biography is the life of a talented Mexican-born Hispanic woman who has managed to be a successful actress, director, and producer in Hollywood. She is the first Mexican star to play a female lead in an American movie since Dolores Del Río.
This Salma Hayek biography can attest to that and more. Her life is about an upper class Hispanic immigrant who at a young age managed to become one of the top Hispanic artists, all through hard work and of course beauty, one attribute that always helps an actress.
The Salma Hayek biography is filled with business successes, among them becoming the top advocate for Latin films through her partnership with MGM and José Tamez which lead to the creation of Ventanazul. Ventanazul is Sakmas film company specializing in Latino movies that appeal to mainstream audiences. Salma is the president and CEO.
Many of her followers appreciate her candid comments as well as her practicality. This is reflected in an interview she gave for People magazine in 2007 where she openly talks about the pressures society imposes on women: “You’ve got to be beautiful, smart, skinny, tall, rich, successful at your job, married to the right guy  and have genius children. And by the way, you also have to be a nun!”
Any Salma Hayek biography tells you that she was raised in a well-to-do Catholic family. Her father is of Lebanese descent and her mother is of Spanish descent, which may explain her exotic beauty.
As she said in an interview with Inside The Actors Studio, she didnt really have any struggles growing up as the daughter of an entrepreneur who besides owning hardware stores and a construction business, ended up maintaining some oil refineries in Mexico in her home town, Coatzacoalcos.
Her mother was an opera-singer as reported in the article “The Beautiful Mind of Salma Hayek” that appeared in Razor magazine in 2003.
At a very young age sexy Salma Hayek pressured her father to send her to the U.S. to study. How did she do it? Well rumors say she told him she would “go on strike” and fail all her classes if he did not do it. Not one Salma Hayek biography can cite the source of these comments but in the Inside The Actors Studio interview she confirms wanting to study abroad after her father didnt let her go to Mexico City to train as a gymnast.
After two years in Catholic school in Louisiana, the Gods helpers, the nuns, expelled her for playing pranks on them. She went back to Mexico and finished high school. After that she was sent to Texas in the U.S. to live with her aunt.
The next chapter in the Salma Hayek biography shows a decisive move to pursue her dreams. Back in Mexico she enrolled in international relations studies at the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City. She dropped out of school to follow her dream of becoming an actress.
Salma Hayek confessed in an interview with Inside The Actors Studio that seeing the famous film Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory in 1971 sparked her desire to become an actress.
She started playing roles at neighborhood theaters. These roles led to jobs making television commercials, which led to a part in a popular daytime TV series in Mexico called Nuevo Amanecer.
Her big break in Mexico came when she played the title role of “Teresa,” a phenomenally famous soap opera that catapulted her to stardom. But Mexico was not enough for this small Hispanic woman who is only 52. Sexy Salma Hayek left Teresa in 1989, and Mexico in 1991 at the top of her career to conquer Hollywood in what many people called a crazy move.
Any Salma Hayek biography that states her fame was an easy task is innacurate. In Los Angeles, she dedicated herself to improving her English and studied acting under famed coach Stella Adler. Salma Hayek soon found out that Hollywood was a tough place, more so for a Hispanic woman trying to make a career in acting.
By late 1993, her career was not impressive at all as she only had played very small parts. She appeared on Dream On in 1990, Nurses and Street Justice in 1991, and The Sinbad Show and a small line in the Allison Sanders film Mi Vida Loca in 1993. She didn’t know her life was about to change.
It is difficult to find one biography of Salma Hayek not crediting her first big discovery to a late-night Spanish-language talk show in 1992. That night the famous director Robert Rodriguez watched her on TV and was immediately taken by Salmas intelligence, beauty and strong opinions about the struggles of being a Latino actress in Hollywood.
Robert Rodriguez asked her to star opposite Antonio Banderas in Desperado in 1995. After this film the sexy Salma Hayek was on the Hollywood map. The critics and moviegoers loved her.
In 1996, following Desperados success Robert Rodriguez gave her another role, now to star in From Dusk Till Dawn opposite to George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino. By the end of 1997 she appeared in Fools Rush In opposite to Matthew Perry, Breaking Up along Russell Crowe, and The Hunchback where she played Esmeralda.
In 1998 she starred alongside Mike Myers as Anita Randazzo in the movie 54, about the legendary NYC nightclub Studio 54. This same year Revlon approached the Salma Hayek to sign her as its spokesperson, an amazing offer she did not reject.
In 1999 she participated in Dogma as Serendipity. The same year, her production company Ventanarosa, brought us El Coronel No Tiene Quien Le Escriba, based on the novel of Colombian Nobel Prize winner Gabriel García Márquez. This film was selected as Mexicos official entry for best foreign film at the Cannes Film Festival.
The new millennium started on a positive note and the Salma Hayek biography was getting more impressive. She co-produced and starred in her dream movie “Frida,” released in 2002. The film portrayed the life of the acclaimed Mexican painter Frida Khalo who was married to the muralist Diego Rivera. Reviews about her role were phenomenal.
Frida won the German Golden Camera Award, and two U.S. Academy Awards -for makeup and musical creation, out of six nominations including best actress for Hayek. She also won a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture in the drama category, a nomination for a British Academy Award, and a Screen Actors Guild nomination.
Frida gave Salma Hayek the ability to show her real talent allowing her to transcend above her sex symbol status. Ironically, Hayek has admitted that while the movie Frida was a high point in her career, financially it was not a winning proposition for her.
In 2003 the sexy Salma Hayek worked again with Robert Rodriguez in “Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over” and the last film of his Mexican trilogy, “Once Upon a Time in Mexico.” Antonio Banderas and Salma received top billing and the film garnered big box-office returns.
When Showtime approached her to direct the movie “The Maldonado Miracle” she initially turned down the offer. Later on, she was awarded an Emmy as outstanding director for her work on this movie that was released in January 2003.
In 2004 Salma Hayek was one of the most photographed women, which caught the attention of multimillion dollar cosmetic brand Avon. Avon Foundation News reported in June 2004 that Salma was now its spokesperson against domestic violence. This human touch in her career was another great achievement to add to the Salma Hayek biography.
In 2004 she also played the love partner of Pierce Brosnan in the comedy “After The Sunset,” directed by Brett Ratner. This year she made a mark in Hollywood becoming the highest paid Latina, earning about $20 million per year in film contracts alone.
Salma directed a music video for Prince called Te Amo Corazón I Love You Sweetheart. In a PRNewswire story released in December 2005 Prince said: “Salma is the most thoughtful, attentive director I have ever worked with. An absolute joy.”
In 2006 the Salma Hayek biography continued to include important achievements, especially after she became the executive producer of the American version of the popular Colombian novela (soap opera), Yo Soy Betty, La Fea Ugly Betty.
The original Yo Soy Betty, La Fea soap opera captivated Hispanic audiences from 1999 to 2001. The new series aired in September 2006 on ABC, and won a Golden Globe in 2007 for Best Comedy or Musical Series as well as a Golden Globe, Emmy and Screen Actors Guild Award for best actress for
“Bandidas” was also a movie she co-stared with her very good friend Penelope Cruz. The movie drew poor reviews with some of them citing lack of creativity, and describing it as boring.
In 2007 Todd Robinson directed “Lonely Hearts,” a film where Salma plays the role of a partner in crime to a man-Raymond Fernandez played by Jared Leto-who meets single rich women through ads.  Also the same year, sexy Salma Hayek participated in the musical film “Across The Universe” directed by Julie Taymor. The cast includes notable entertainers such as Bono, Eddie Izzard and Diana Fuch.
Her love life is one aspect in the Salma Hayek biography that seems to draw a lot of attention.  In an interview with Cristina Saralegui in 2004 about the movie “Breaking Up,” Salma Hayek admits to not knowing if she will ever be arried. And who says she has to be? As she mentioned in the interview, there are many choices and all of them good, therefore choosing has become a real difficult decision.
In 1999 sexy Salma Hayek started dating actor Edward Norton. Many in Hollywood were betting on the couples marriage. The couple split up in 2003 after a four-year relationship.
In 2003 she dated Josh Lucas until 2004. Salma is currently married to French businessman Francois-Henri Pinault. He is the CEO of the firm that owns Gucci and Yves Saint Lauren and his family fortune is estimated at $7 billion. He was previously married and has two children.
New York Daily News columnist Ben Widdicombe first reported that Salma Hayek and her fiancé Pinault were engaged and expecting their first child in March 2007. Salma Hayek gave birth to a baby girl, Valentina Paloma Pinault on Friday September 13, 2007. The hapiness didn’t last and the couple was divorced in July 2008.
This Salma Hayek biography is simply put, the fascinating story of a sex symbol and a smart business woman.

Widely considered to be the first Mexican actress to become a Hollywood movie star since Dolores Del Rio, Salma Hayek is known for bringing a fiery presence and striking, dark-eyed beauty to the screen. A soap star in her native Mexico, Hayek risked her entire career to come to L.A., where she struggled to be taken seriously. Her discovery by director Robert Rodriguez, who cast her in his 1995 film Desperado, gave Hayek her breakthrough, and she subsequently gained a reputation as one of Hollywood's sexiest and busiest actresses. The daughter of a Spanish mother and Lebanese father, Hayek was born in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico, on September 2, 1966. Raised in a devoutly Catholic family, she was sent to a Louisiana boarding school at the age of 12. After getting into trouble for terrorizing the nuns, Hayek returned to Mexico, but she was eventually sent to Houston, Texas, to live with her aunt, where she stayed until she was 17. She subsequently moved to Mexico City, where she studied International Relations as a university student, but, to the chagrin of her family, decided to drop out in order to pursue a career as an actress. Starting out in local theatre productions, she eventually moved to television and landed a starring role in the popular soap opera Teresa. The show's success made Hayek a celebrity in her native country, but, desiring something more, she shocked her fans by deciding to quit the show in order to pursue a career in L.A. After taking a year to learn English and study acting with Stella Adler, Hayek got her first break when Allison Anders cast her in a supporting role in Mi Vida Loca (1993). The role allowed Hayek to obtain a Screen Actors Guild card, and after doing so, she continued to audition until she appeared on a Spanish-language cable access talk show that happened to count director Robert Rodriguez amongst its viewers. Rodriguez tracked Hayek down and promptly cast her in Desperado, his bigger-budget 1995 sequel to El Mariachi. The film, which also starred Antonio Banderas, succeeded in giving the actress her own plot on the Hollywood map, and Rodriguez again demonstrated his faith in her when he cast her in his next project, the vampire extravaganza From Dusk Till Dawn (1996).  Unfortunately for Hayek, the film, which also starred George Clooney, failed to do as well as expected, and Hayek's next few projects were similarly lackluster. The Faculty (1998), a teen thriller that cast Hayek as a teacher who turns into an alien, was an exception, and Kevin Smith's Dogma (1999), which featured her as a celestial muse, was fairly successful with critics and audiences. Also in 1999, Hayek had a starring role in what was to be her biggest film to date, Barry Sonnenfeld's Wild Wild West, which also starred Will Smith and Kevin Kline. Unfortunately for all involved, the film was a turkey. In 2000, Hayek could be seen in smaller, edgier ventures, including the independent comedy Chain of Fools, in which she played a centerfold-turned- cop, and Mike Figgis' experimental Time Code, which cast her as Jeanne Tripplehorn's lover. If these films ultimately didn't provide Hayek with a role that would draw attention to her genuine talent, this would soon change with the long awaited biography of tragic artist Frida Kahlo. With her role as the epnoymous character in Frida (2002), Hayek disappeared into her subject so convincingly that not only would she return to the good graces of critics, but earn an Oscar nomination as well. Hayek would spend the coming years enjoying superstar status with everything from comedic turns on sitcoms like Ugly Betty (which she produced) and 30 Rock, to meaty roles in dramatic thrillers like Savages. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi
