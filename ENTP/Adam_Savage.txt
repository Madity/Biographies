Adam Whitney Savage (born July 15, 1967)[2] is an American industrial design and special effects designer/fabricator, actor, educator, and one of two co-hosts of the Discovery Channel television series MythBusters and Unchained Reaction.[1] His model work has appeared in major films, including Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones and The Matrix Reloaded. He is a prominent member of the skeptic community. He lives in San Francisco with his twin sons and wife, Julia.
Born in New York City, Savage was raised in Sleepy Hollow in Westchester County, New York.[3] He graduated from Sleepy Hollow High School in 1985.[4] His father, Whitney Lee Savage (1928–1998), was a painter, filmmaker and animator known for his work on Sesame Street, and has a permanent exhibit in the Avampato Discovery Museum.[5] His mother is a psychotherapist. His sister Kate Savage is also an artist. As a teenager in Sleepy Hollow, he routinely visited the local bike shop to have flat tires fixed. The shop showed him how to do the repairs himself. From this experience, Savage said, "I realized you could take a bike apart and put it back together and it wasn't that hard...I've been building and putting bicycles together since then."[4]
Adam Savage began acting as a child, and has had five years of acting school.[1] His early credits include voicing animated characters that his father produced for Sesame Street, Mr. Whipple's stock boy "Jimmy" in a Charmin commercial, a helper in the special effects of Star Wars, and a drowning young man saved by a lifeguard in the 1985 Billy Joel music video "You're Only Human (Second Wind)".[6]
Describing the early abandonment of his acting career, Savage said that "by the time I was, I guess probably nineteen, I had passed on that in favor of doing stuff with my hands – graphic design, assistant animation in New York, and then eventually working in theater in San Francisco, and film special effects. Then MythBusters came along and it was the perfect marriage of two things, performance and special effects."[7] On November 25, 2011, Savage received an honorary doctorate from the University of Twente (Enschede, Netherlands) for his role in the popularization of science and technology.[8][9]
Savage has worked as an animator, graphic designer, carpenter, projectionist, film developer, television presenter, set designer, toy designer, and gallery owner. He worked as a model maker on the films Galaxy Quest, Bicentennial Man, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, The Matrix Reloaded, and Space Cowboys, among others.
Savage played the role of a helpful engineer in the 2001 film Ever Since the World Ended[10] and the role of an army surplus store owner who sells a man a rocket engine for his pickup truck in 2006 in The Darwin Awards, which also featured MythBusters co-star Jamie Hyneman.[11] He made a cameo appearance along with Jamie Hyneman on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation on the May 1, 2008, episode "The Theory of Everything." In the "making of" material for The Matrix Revolutions, he appears in his role as a special effects artist and discusses some of the miniature effects used and the difficulties involved.
He previously taught advanced model making in the department of Industrial Design at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco.[1]
Savage has become a regular presenter at magician James Randi's annual skeptics' conference, The Amaz!ng Meeting, since first appearing in January 2006.[12] He also appeared in the UK, giving a talk at the first Amazing Meeting London from October 3–4, 2009, hosted at the Mermaid Conference Centre, Blackfriars.[13]
Savage was a featured performer at the three w00tstock v1.x shows in 2009, and appeared in four w00tstock v2.x shows in 2010. He also appeared as a guest on Diggnation's 220th show.[14]
Savage has also been a regular guest speaker at the annual Maker Faire since 2008, speaking on different topics such as his obsession with the dodo bird and problem solving, and also taking questions from the audience members about the Mythbusters and other things.
Savage hosted an episode of the Discovery Channel series Curiosity, in which he speculated as to whether or not it is possible for humans to live forever. During the program various topics such as limb regeneration, organ printers, and even age reversal are discussed.
In 2011, Adam Savage appeared as Dan in a short film directed by Frank Ippolito entitled Night of the Little Dead.[15]
Savage is an occasional guest host for lecture events at the San Francisco-based non-profit City Arts & Lectures.,[17] and delivered the keynote address at South by Southwest (SXSW) Interactive Festival on March 10, 2014.[18]
Savage has been involved in MythBusters since its creation. His role in the show (that he shares with all the other talent) is to either disprove ("bust") myths or confirm them through testing and experiments done at different scales. If the myth is about a one-time occurrence and not about whether or not something can happen at all, it is often deemed "plausible" instead.
Savage's demeanour on MythBusters is animated and energetic, providing a foil to Jamie Hyneman's more reserved straight man persona.[19]
Savage and Hyneman were the only hosts of the show for the first season of MythBusters. Starting with the second season, members of Hyneman's staff were introduced and began to appear regularly in episodes; Kari Byron, Tory Belleci and welder Scottie Chapman appeared in the second season. In the third season, Chapman was replaced by Grant Imahara, a robot builder and model maker. In an interview Savage gave during The Amaz!ng Meeting 5, he expressed an interest in proving natural selection over creationism on MythBusters.
My goal this year [2007] is to prove natural selection on the show. It's gonna take a while, it's gonna be very hard to make it fascinating on film in the context of our narrative structure, but I figure screw it. The sky's the limit. Let's do natural selection. I'm sick of fifty percent of this country thinking creationism is reasonable. It's appalling. And I have the unique ability, maybe, to sell this idea to Discovery, and they'll, they might allow me to do it, and I'm gonna try as hard as I can.[20]
Savage also stated that such an episode is unlikely because MythBusters has a policy against trying to disprove supernatural phenomena.[21]
Savage and his wife Julia were married in 2002. He has twin sons, Addison and Riley, from a previous relationship.[22] Savage considers himself an atheist.[23] Savage wears a hearing aid on his left ear due to a congenital condition.[24] He is also a practiced juggler as seen on Mythbusters. Savage has a lifelong interest in costume making and cosplay. He said, "I remember my Mom getting me a 'Jaws' costume when 'Jaws' came out...and wearing a Batman costume. Back then, everyone dressed up as hobos." He strives for authenticity with his costumes. While in high school, he and his father made a suit of armor out of aluminum roof flashing that had 700 rivets. He said, "I wore it to school and passed out from heat exhaustion in math class. I woke up in the nurse's office and the first thing I said was 'Where's my armor?'" In 2011, he built a costume based on the character No-Face from the film Spirited Away.[4] In 2012, he was the commencement speaker at Sarah Lawrence College.[25]

          Adam Savage started his varied career as a child actor. His father worked on Sesame Street as a Muppeteer and he learned very early on about 'behind the scene' work on a television show. He appeared in some episodes of Sesame Street. Later on, as a teenager, he starred in the Billy Joel video for "Second Wind" and a Charmin toilet paper commercial with Mr. Whipple as Jimmy the stock boy.Adam has worked as an interior designer, a set designer for the Fool's Fury playhouse in San Francisco, and an artist. His artwork has been displayed in San Francisco, New York and Charleston, West Virginia. He also worked in toy prototyping, working in research and development for Zoob toys, and designing several displays and a large "Zoob Dude" model for them. Adam has worked on many TV commercials for Pizza Hut, Burger King and Coca-Cola, among others. He designed his own robot for Battlebots, "Claymore".However, Adam is best known for his work in Sci-Fi movies and of course, MythBusters (2003). He was employed by George Lucas' special effects shop, Industrial Light and Magic, working with Tory Belleci and Grant Imahara. He has worked on Space Cowboys (2000), Galaxy Quest (1999), Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999), Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002), The Matrix Reloaded (2003), The Matrix Revolutions (2003) and Bicentennial Man (1999), among others. In 2002, Adam and Jamie Hyneman, long time collaborators on various projects, including the BattleBots (2000) robot Blendo, got together to film 3 pilot episodes for Mythbusters. The rest is history. Adam plays around with heavy machinery, indulges in building elaborate rigs, and gets to blow stuff up - always putting his body on the line for the show. He has donated every body fluid imaginable for scientific testing in the course of the show, and has taken many hits for the team. He provides much of the 'comic relief' to co-host Hyneman's 'straight-man' persona.Adam is the father of twin sons!
      Appeared as a teenage grocery clerk in one of Charmin's long-running "Mr. Whipple" television ads in the early 1980s.
      I wouldn't say Jamie [Hyneman] is an evil genius. I'm not sure he's evil and I'm not sure he's a genius.

ADAM SAVAGE has spent his life gathering skills that allow him to take what's in his brain and make it real.  He's built everything from ancient Buddhas to futuristic weapons, from spaceships to dancing vegetables, from fine art sculptures to animated chocolate — and just about anything else you can think of.
The son of a filmmaker/painter and a psychotherapist, Adam has been making his own toys since he was allowed to hold scissors.  Having held positions as a projectionist, animator, graphic designer, carpenter, interior and stage designer, toy designer, welder, and scenic painter, he's worked with every material and in every medium he could fathom — metal, paper, glass, plastic, rubber, foam, plaster, pneumatics, hydraulics, animatronics, neon, glassblowing, mold-making and injection molding to name just a few.
Since 1993, Adam was concentrated on the special effects industry, honing his skills through more than 100 television commercials and a dozen feature films, including Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace and Episode II: Attack of the Clones, Galaxy Quest, Terminator 3, A.I. and the Matrix sequels.  He's also designed props and sets for Coca-Cola, Hershey's, Lexus and a host of New York and San Francisco theater companies.
Not only has he worked and consulted in the research and development division for toy companies and made several short films, but Adam has also acted in several films and   commercials — including a Charmin ad, in which he played Mr. Whipple's stock boy, and a Billy Joel music video, "Second Wind," in which he drowns.
Today, in addition to co-hosting MythBusters, Adam teaches, lectures and consults on a variety of topics to students, business folks and everyday Joes.  Somehow he also finds time to devote to his own art — his SCULPTURES have been showcased in over 40 shows in San Francisco, New York and Charleston, West Virginia.

As his official MythBusters bio puts it, "Adam Savage has spent his life gathering skills that allow him to take what's in his brain and make it real." He worked as a special-effects artist, fabricator, modelmaker and general dreamer-upper for a decade and a half, working on films such as Galaxy Quest and the Matrix sequels, as well as Episodes I and II of the Star Wars series.In 2002, he and his fellow movie-industry veteran Jamie Hyneman  became the hosts of MythBusters, a Discovery Channel show that puts urban myths and rules of thumb to test in visceral, often hilarious ways. Behind the sheer awesomeness of their rocket cars and flaming projectiles, the MythBusters are a force for science education.

Adam Savage’s Biography: Ever since Adam Savage was a young boy in Westchester County, New York, he has been creating different kinds of objects and gadgets. He was born on July 15, 1967 and at the early age of five was already building his own toys. Having a father who was painter, animator and director gave Savage a lot of opportunities to explore his own creativity. When Savage was just a child actor, he worked with his father on the highly popular children’s television show Sesame Street. As he grew older, he followed in his father’s footsteps, becoming an animator, graphic set and toy designer, and a carpenter. He spent a lot of time developing his craft in creating special effects and consequently worked on big blockbusters like Star Wars Episodes I and II and A.I. Savage is currently co-hosting Mythbusters , a scientific reality television program from the Discovery channel. On the show, Savage is noticeably childish and foolish, and his behavior often causes him to sustain minor injuries. His famous quotes from the show have arisen from his entertaining yet very dangerous experiments in the show. One quote was derived after some of Savage’s hair was burned off during an explosion test. He also sustained an injury to his lower lip when he was studying a device called the “Homemade Hovercraft.”

MythBusters is a science entertainment TV program created and produced by an Australian company, The show's hosts, special effects experts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, use elements of the scientific method to test the validity of rumors, myths, movie scenes, adages, Internet videos and news stories. And I like to watch this show on Discovery Channel.   http://mythbusters.otavo.tv/ 
To have the kind of dedication Adam Savage have in order to pursue a goal is quite remarkable, and I only wish someday I will have this kind of dedication as well.
I think Adam Savage is a wonderful example of an Atheist...One of my Christian friends who loved Myth Busters until he found out Adam was an Atheist. What a shame that people actually allow their Bronze Age Views to control them in this manner. SAD!
You should remember when the bad guys start breaking the surface to see if inside of it there were jewels and all the other legendary stuff. 
I don't know why I have also thought that it was made of bronze. It is not logic. It should have been expected to be made of GOLD! 
The real one was made of clay. That is part of the plot. Another alternative material would destroy the complete story... 
Why is it that all the obsessed bad guys went all the story hoping to find a solid body made of gold? And people got the idea that it was made of bronze? Another expected ending? 
I don't know. It finally contradicts the end of the story that says that dreams are made of a kind of clay.  
What a fantastic look into the mind of Adam Savage, and a well put-together presentation too. I can geek out on things with the best of them, but Savage is on a whole other plane of existence - well done.
Savage absolutely nails this presentation!  A Fascinating glimpse into the mind of the obsessed and extraordinary. Love watching him pull all the elements together as he goes.
I agree that it seemed there should have been more on the episode. Regardless michaelsalisbury says everything I could.  
Adam is Extranordinary!   Adam   is so cool, I am a total fan, it is so cool, that he knows so much and has done so much, I mean I knew he was incredible from all the Myth Busters shows (I totally love all of them!), and I alway felt he and his friends are total masters of our world and all that it contains, but now I have a better understanding of where he is coming from, and why he is so extraordinary! 
So that being said, I can learn a tiny bit and apply it to my own life and start tracking some of the ideas that are already going on in my head! 
Thanks so much, and for some reason, fora will not let me view the whole program , maybe I am doing something wrong ...
