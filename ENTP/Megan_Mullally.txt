So I get a call one day from my agent that I'd gotten offered a guest role, and it paid $5,000. I literally fell down onto my knees and testified and wept. I played some former protégée of Jessica Fletcher. It's one of my favorite things I've ever shot."[4]
In 1989, Mullally tested for the co-starring role of Elaine Benes on Seinfeld.[4] Mullally in 1998 landed the role of Karen Walker, Grace Adler's sarcastic, pill-popping assistant, in the NBC sitcom Will & Grace.

Mullally plays the role of the second ex-wife of the character Ron Swanson, played by her real-life husband, Nick Offerman.[6] Offerman also had a part on one episode of Mullally's show Will & Grace where he played a plumber that came to Will's mother's house while Will, Karen, Grace, and Jack were visiting.
Mullally co-starred in 2010 as Lydia on the Starz ensemble series Party Down.[7] Mullally currently co-stars as "Chief" on the Adult Swim series Childrens Hospital. In 2011, Mullally began a recurring role as Dana Hartz, the mother of Penny (Casey Wilson), on the ABC sitcom Happy Endings. The following months, Fox announced Mullally would join the series Breaking In when the show returned for a second season on March 6, 2012.
Mullally made her Broadway debut as Marty in the 1994 revival of Grease, and subsequently appeared as Rosemary in the hit 1995 revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying opposite Matthew Broderick. In 2007, Mullally starred as Elizabeth in Mel Brooks' original Broadway musical, Young Frankenstein. She can be heard on the cast albums of all three productions.
In 1996, she starred in You Never Know at the Pasadena Playhouse. Mullally appeared in 2000 as Pamela in the multiple award-winning production of Chuck Mee's The Berlin Circle, for which she won both the LA Weekly Theatre Award and the Backstage West Garland Award. Mullally starred as Beverly in the acclaimed production of Adam Bock's The Receptionist at the Odyssey Theatre (notably, the longest sold-out run of a show in that theatre's history), for which she was awarded the 2010 Backstage West Garland Award for Best Performance by an Actress.
Mullally is also a Chicago theater veteran[citation needed] and member of Los Angeles theatre company The Evidence Room.[citation needed]
Mullally is currently starring along with her real life husband, Nick Offerman in "Annapurna" at the Acorn Theatre on New York's 42nd Street Theatre Row.
Mullally is a member of the band Supreme Music Program.[8] SMP has released three albums to date, The Sweetheart Break-In, Big as a Berry and Free Again!.[8][9]
Mullally and Stephanie Hunt formed the band Nancy and Beth in 2012. They went on tour in March 2013, along with Megan's husband Nick Offerman.
Mullally has appeared in Marc Forster's Sundance competition entry Everything Put Together, Anywhere But Here with Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman, About Last Night with Demi Moore and Rob Lowe, Speaking of Sex with James Spader, and Stealing Harvard with Tom Green and Jason Lee. Mullally played a singing teacher in the 2009 film remake of Fame,[10] and can be heard on the soundtrack recording. Additionally, Mullally sang the song "Long John Blues" (performed on-screen by Kristen Bell) in 2010's Burlesque. She recently played the role of a mother in the 2013 indie film The Kings of Summer.
In 2000, Mullally met actor Nick Offerman while doing a play together in Los Angeles. The two married in 2003. Offerman guest-starred on Will & Grace during its fourth season; in return, Mullally has guest-starred on Parks and Recreation, on which Offerman plays a lead role. Mullally plays Tammy, the conniving ex-wife of Offerman's character Ron Swanson, appearing in six episodes so far.
In 1999, Mullally commented in an interview in The Advocate magazine, "I consider myself bisexual, and my philosophy is, everyone innately is."[12] In March 2013, while on the talk show Kathy, she appeared with her husband and fellow guest Michelle Trachtenberg, and when Griffin opened a poll of who is heterosexual, Mullally raised her hand. Subsequent, post-Advocate interviews with websites AfterEllen in 2006 and Queerty in 2009 again supported the stance that Mullally was heterosexual.[13][14] In a 2010 interview with The Advocate she clarified the confusion regarding her comment in 1999, stating: "I know the gay community wants me to be bisexual, but unfortunately I’m not as bisexual as people have wanted me to be. I am married to a man, we’ve been together 10 years, and I’ve never had sex with a woman. But I do still think everybody has an ability to love that isn’t limited by gender."[15]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Megan is an only child born in Los Angeles, California. Her mother, Martha, was a model. Her father, Carter Mullally Jr., is a retired contract player for Paramount. Megan first entered Northwestern University intending to study acting, but switched to English literature. However, she still ended up starring in several campus musicals, which gained attention from producers and prompted her to drop out of school. In 1985, she moved to Los Angeles with no particular success. But, in 1994, she co-starred in "Grease" with Rosie O'Donnell and, in 1995, in "How To Succeed In Business" with Matthew Broderick. Her star has been rising ever since.
      She starred in and directed an original performance art piece, The Sweetheart Break-In. The band released a CD of some of the songs in the show, called 'The Supreme Music Program: The Sweetheart Break-In'. They have released two other CDs called 'Big As A Berry' and 'Free Again'.
      Her father, Carter Mullally Jr., who died in 1992, was a contract player with Paramount in the 1950s. Her mother, Martha, was formerly a model.
      Close friend is ER (1994) actress Laura Innes. The two met at Northwestern University in the late 70s and have been friends ever since.
      She studied ballet and was a soloist with Oklahoma City's Ballet Oklahoma. She also studied at George Balanchine's School of American Ballet.
      Auditioned for the role of Elaine on Seinfeld (1989). (According to the Seinfeld special, aired on 25 November 2004.)
      Has won 3 consecutive Screen Actors Guild Awards (SAG) for Outstanding performance by an actress in a comedy, and has a total of 4 SAG Awards and 2 Emmy Awards.
      First cast member of Will & Grace (1998) to win an Emmy. She won in 2000 for Outstanding performance by an actress in a supporting role comedy. Her co-star, Sean Hayes, also won that year.
      Was featured in "Theater Week" as one of six "New Faces of 1995," alongside Rufus Sewell, Jude Law, Jennifer Dundas, Justin Kirk, and Billy Crudup. Ironically, she stated in that issue that she was done with television, and in five years would like "to be doing plays and musicals [in New York], and also film work."
      Before she was cast to appear with Debra Messing on Will & Grace (1998), Megan Mullally appeared on an episode of Messing's previous series Ned and Stacey (1995).
      She was nominated for a 1979 Joseph Jefferson Award for Actress in a Supporting Role in a Musical for her performance in "Bagtime" at the Wisdom Bridge Theatre in Chicago, Illinois.
      Withdrew from the Broadway production of "Lips Together, Teeth Apart", due to difficulties with the director, Joe Mantello.
      Starred as Beverly in the acclaimed production of Adam Bart's "The Receptionist" at the Odyssey Theatre (notably, the longest sold-out run of a show in that theater's history), for which she was awarded the 2010 Backstage West Garland Award for Best Performance by an Actress.
      She appeared in an episode of Ned and Stacey (1995), although she didn't have a single scene with future Will & Grace (1998) co-star Debra Messing.
      Megan Mullally has acted with her husband Nick Offerman both on Will & Grace and Parks & Recreation.
      Currently starring as "Elizabeth" in Mel Brooks' new musical, "Young Frankenstein". [September 2007]
      I didn't get Will & Grace (1998) until I was almost 40. Had I listened to everybody else who kept saying, 'Oh, there's too much competition, you'll never get an agent, you'll never get a part, 90 percent of actors are out of work," if I'd listened to that, if everybody listened to that, then nobody would leave the house and the world would come to a crashing halt.
      When I went up there and accepted the [second] Emmy, I remembered that when I was about 20, a psychic told me I was going to win two Emmys that were going to be like bookends for playing a secretary on a sitcom. And I said, 'I'm not going to do sitcoms. I'm a great actress and I'm going to change the world.'
      I'll quit coffee. It won't be easy drinking my Bailey's straight, but I'll get used to it. It'll still be the best part of waking up.

Actress Megan Mullally was born in Los Angeles in 1958, to a family with show business roots -- her father, Carter Mullally Jr., was an actor who became a contract player with Paramount Pictures during the 1950s. In 1965, with Carter's career on the wane, Mullally's parents pulled up roots and moved to Oklahoma City, OK, where her family had become quite wealthy raising livestock. Megan picked up the performing bug from her father, and developed a passionate interest in music and especially dance. By the time Megan was a high school student, she'd performed as a featured soloist with the Ballet Oklahoma troupe in Oklahoma City, and during summer vacations she studied with George Balanchine's School of American Ballet in New York City.  Her interest in classical dance eventually grew into a desire to act, and while attending Northwestern University, she began appearing in student theater productions. After graduating, Mullally moved to Chicago, where she immersed herself in the city's rich and varied local theater scene. In 1983, she won her first film role, playing a hooker in Risky Business, and in 1986 she relocated to Los Angeles after being cast on a television series, The Ellen Burstyn Show. However, the series proved short-lived, and Mullally was soon busying herself with guest spots on a number of different shows. Mullally continued to work in the theater, and in 1994 fulfilled a longtime dream when she scored a role in the Broadway revival of Grease. The next year, she earned a high-profile role in another noted Broadway musical, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (playing opposite Matthew Broderick), while continuing to work in television projects. Mullally's dedication and focus finally paid off in 1998, when she was cast as Karen Walker, a self-centered former socialite-turned-office assistant on the popular situation comedy series Will and Grace. A major ratings success, Will and Grace catapulted Mullally into the spotlight, and she won an Emmy Award, a Golden Globe, and an American Comedy Award for her work on the show. When not busy with Will and Grace, Mullally continues to pursue other projects, playing featured roles in the films Everything Put Together and Monkeybone and starring in a one-woman musical, Sweetheart, in which she shows off her talents as a singer. (Mullally has also released an album of songs from the show, which she produced herself.) Mullally would continue her successful career on Broadway while enjoying the long running success of Will and Grace, and would go on to appear in other successful TV series as well, like In the Motherhood, Party Down, Childrens' Hospital, and Parks and Recreation. ~ Rovi

Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally are out to prove that the couple that works together, stays together.
Offerman, 42, and Mullally, 54, met in 2000 while rehearsing a play and are currently costarring in the film "The Kings of Summer" and the play "Annapurna," they told Buzzfeed Tuesday. Offerman said he's always considered himself Mullally's "student." 
"She’s often been a hero to me, and so getting to work with her as a peer in any way is like -- I feel like Luke Skywalker getting to go into lightsaber battle standing next to Obi-Wan Kenobi. I’m like, 'Alright, me and you. Let’s take ‘em on,'" Offerman said. "I have the best seat in the house in our play, to watch Megan, and she’s amazing." 
Offerman and Mullally married in a surprise ceremony the day before the Emmy Awards in 2003. They've also costarred on "Will & Grace," "Parks and Recreation" and "Children's Hospital."
In 2010, Offerman told New York magazine that they made a deal to discuss any job that would keep them apart for more than a couple of weeks.
