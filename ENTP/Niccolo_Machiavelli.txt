Niccolò Machiavelli was born in Florence on May 3, 1469 and died in Florence on June 21, 1527. He was a philosopher, statesman, and political theorist and is often referred to as the father of modern political theory.
Not much is known about Niccolò Machiavellis early life. Born into a wealthy and very influential family, Niccolò Machiavelli received a rigorous educational training and entered the Florentine government as a clerk in 1494. In the same year the Medici family lost its power and was forced into exile after having ruled Florence for the previous 60 years. Soon Niccolò Machiavelli began a career as diplomat, undertaking missions to the major cities in Italy as well as to France and Spain, where he, among many others, met Louis XII, Ferdinand II and Pope Julius II. Between 1502 and 1503 he came into contact with the son of Pope Alexander VI, Cesare Borgia, an ambitious and cruel commander. Niccolò Machiavelli witnessed this virile son expand his power throughout central Italy and this experience had a lasting effect on the young Machiavelli. Over the next few years Niccolò Machiavelli took charge of the Florentine militia and was responsible for the reorganization of the republic´s military defense.
Niccolò Machiavelli wrote his first work in 1499 entitled, Discorso sopra le cose di Pisa (Discourse on Pisa), and in 1502, Discorso sopra la provisione del danaro (Discourse about the Provision of Money). In the same year as the latter treatise, Niccolò Machiavelli also completed the short treatise Del modo di trattare i sudditi della Valdichiana ribellati (On the Way to Deal with the Rebel Subjects of the Valdichiana). Here he begins to develop many of his larger and ongoing themes, for example his use of the Romans as an example of how to address rebellion. Other early works of Niccolò Machiavelli include the political analyses Ritratti delle cose dell Alemagna (Portrait of the affairs of Germany, 15081512) and Ritratti delle cose di Francia (Portrait of the affairs of France, 1510).
The year 1512 marks an important period for Machiavelli; the Medici family came back into power and, as a consequence, the Florentine republic ceased to exist. Having been dismissed from his post as diplomat and suspected of conspiracy, in which he was arrested and tortured, Niccolò Machiavelli had to retire to his fathers estate outside of Florence. Nonetheless, he desperately tried to regain a governmental position and this attempt marks his most famous piece Il Principe (The Prince), written in 1513, but not published until after his death. It was with this treatise that Niccolò Machiavelli hoped to return to service under the Medicis. Yet, and even though he had purposely dedicated the work to Lorenzo de' Medici, he did not manage to regain a position. Instead, the book caused a great controversy, as it was simply a study on how to acquire and maintain power.
Yet, perhaps more than that, the main aim of the Il Principe is a critique of traditional moral norms and ideologies regarding the exercise of power. Niccolò Machiavelli argues that a ruler should not care about these norms (or laws in general) and should only be concerned with authority and power, which are equal, and war:
A prince should therefore have no other aim or thought, nor take up any other thing for his study but war and it organization and discipline, for that is the only art that is necessary to one who commands.
The only rules for a prince are those that lead to the insurance and preservation of power, for it is the stable state that is the highest good. Power is intrinsically linked to politics, and there is no stability without power. Thus, it is not surprising that the term Machiavellian has come to describe the astute and immoral execution of power.
All this must be seen through the historical context of the Florentine and Roman Republics. It was a time where conflicts dominated political life and each city needed to protect itself. Niccolò Machiavelli argues in favour of a unified Italy, similar to the Roman Republic. While this aspect went more or less unnoticed during his lifetime, it gained greater importance much later during the Risorgimento. While Niccolò Machiavelli was truly Republican, he evidently believed that only the strength of a singular leader could install such a strong Italian state as he conceived. His subsequent texts, known as Discourses on the First Ten Books of Titus Livy (Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio) and regarded as expressions of his more personal beliefs, are considered to be the most important early modern treatise on republicanism, the book aims to elaborate on how a republic should be built and maintained. In the book, Niccolò Machiavelli highly praises the French monarchy and differentiates between a minimal, a strong government balanced by legal mechanisms and a full, the freedom of community, vivere libero, conception of constitutional order. Only in a republic can there be liberty. A commentary on Titus Livius work and early Roman history, the book also contains observations of other political systems and thereby attempts to discover universal laws. The text is somewhat radical in that it is not only highly critical of his contemporaries, but of Christianity, and maintains a distrust of humanity in general:
The people resemble a wild beast, which, naturally fierce, and accustomed to live in the woods, has been brought up, as it were, in a prison and in servitude, and having by accident got its liberty, not being accustomed to search for its food, and not knowing where to conceal itself, easily becomes the prey of the first who seeks to incarcerate it again.
Machiavellis Dell'arte della guerra (The Art of War), written between 1519 and 1520, continues with many of his republican ideas. In this work, the only political work published during his lifetime, he essentially gives instructions on how to acquire and maintain military force and argues that the liberty of a state (and of its citizens) requires the military preparedness of the citizens. He was furthermore convinced that people are more likely to defend liberty than those in power.
No proceeding is better than that which you have concealed from the enemy until the time you have executed it. To know how to recognize an opportunity in war, and take it, benefits you more than anything else. Nature creates few men brave, industry and training makes many.
Niccolò Machiavelli strongly believed in the capacity and responsibility of men towards their own destiny and was consequently greatly distrustful of the common mercenary armies. Instead, Niccolò Machiavelli advocated for a citizen-militia evidenced by him in the Roman army, which seemed to have fulfilled his ideals:
For if no commonwealth has ever been found to grow like the Roman, it is because none was ever found so well fitted by its institutions to make that growth. For by the valour of her armies she spread her empire, while by her conduct of affairs, and by other methods peculiar to herself and devised by her first founder, she was able to keep what she acquired.
Niccolò Machiavelli also worked as a translator and wrote a novel Belfagor arcidiavolo (1527), several poems, and three plays: Mandragola (1518; The Mandrake, 1518), Clizia (1525), and Andria (1517). Mandragola, the most famous, is a comedy that bears some of Machiavellis ethics while caricaturing Italian society. When in Lucca in 1520, he wrote a few pieces La vita di Castruccio Castracani da Lucca (The Life of Castruccio Castracani of Lucca), a comical biography of the medieval duke of Lucca, incarnating Machiavellis ideas of a victorious prince, and the Sommario delle cose della citta di Lucca, a summary on the affaire of the city of Lucca.
In that same year, Niccolò Machiavelli was also made the official historian of Florence by Pope Leo X and was commissioned to write the Istorie fiorentine (History of Florence). Five years later it was completed and he presented the work to Pope Clement VII in 1525 who rewarded him with a stipend. In 1526, he obtained a post as a superintendent of the Procuratori delle Mura di Firenza, responsible for the inspection of the Florentine fortifications. His success, however, was short-lived, as the Medici lost power again in 1527. Disillusioned, Niccolò Machiavelli died in the same year.
Though relatively unrecognised during his lifetime, his influence on political science can hardly be overestimated. He influenced such thinkers as Thomas Hobbes, Francis Bacon and Antonio Gramsci. Amongst philosophers, Baruch Spinoza and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, were his biggest defenders.
Niccolò Machiavelli was a Philosopher, Statesman and Political Theorist. (May 3, 1469 - June 21, 1527)

A Florentine statesman and political theorist, Machiavelli remains one of the most controversial figures of political history. While addressing a wide range of political and historical topics, as well as embracing strictly literary forms, he has come to be identified almost exclusively with his highly controversial manual of state Il principe (The Prince). This straightforward, pragmatic treatise on political conduct and the application of power has, over the centuries, been variously hailed, denounced, and distorted. Seldom has a single work generated such divergent and fierce commentary from such a wide assortment of writers. Commenting on Machiavelli's colorful critical heritage, T. S. Eliot has remarked that no great man has been so completely misunderstood.
Machiavelli was born in Florence to an established though not particularly affluent middle-class family whose members had traditionally filled responsible positions in local government. While little of the author's early life has been documented, it is known that as a boy he learned Latin and that he quickly became an assiduous reader of the ancient classics. Among these, he highly prized his copy of Livy's history of the Roman Republic. Machiavelli's first recorded involvement in the volatile Florentine political scene occurred in 1498, when he helped the political faction that deposed Girolamo Savonarola, then the dominant religious and political figure in Florence. In the same year Machiavelli was appointed to the second chancery of the republic. As chancellor and secretary to the Ten of Liberty and Peace, a sensitive government agency dealing chiefly with warfare and foreign affairs, Machiavelli participated both in domestic politics and in diplomatic missions to foreign governments. These posts afforded him innumerable opportunities over the next fourteen years to closely examine the inner workings of government and to meet prominent individuals, among them Cesare Borgia, who furnished the young diplomat with the major profile in leadership for The Prince. Machiavelli quickly gained political prominence and influence; by 1502 he was a well-respected assistant to the republican gonfalonier, or head of state, Piero Soderini.
In 1512, Spanish forces invaded Italy and the Florentine political climate changed abruptly. The Medici for centuries the rulers of Florence, but exiled since 1494 seized the opportunity to depose Soderini and replace the republican government with their own autocratic regime. Machiavelli was purged from office, jailed and tortured for his well-known republican sentiments, and finally banished to his country residence in Percussina. Machiavelli spent the enforced retirement writing the small body of political writings that insured his literary immortality. Completed between 1513 and 1517, Discorsi ... sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio (Discourses upon the First Decade of T. Livius) and The Prince were not published until after Machiavelli's death, in 1531 and 1532 respectively. Around 1518 he turned from discursive prose to drama in La mandragola (Mandragola); it, like the author's other writings, is firmly predicated on an astute, unsentimental awareness of human nature as flawed and given to self-centeredness. The play was popular with audiences throughout much of Italy for several years. His next effort, a military treatise published in 1521 and entitled Libro della arte della guerra (The Art of War), was the only historical or political work published during the author's lifetime. Meanwhile, Machiavelli had made several attempts to gain favor with the Medici (including dedicating The Prince to Lorenzo). In 1520 he was appointed official historian of Florence and was subsequently entrusted with minor governmental duties. His prodigious Istorie fiorentine (History of Florence) carefully dilutes his republican platform with the Medicean bias expected of him. In 1525 Pope Clement VII recognized his achievement with a monetary stipend. Two years later, the Medici were again ousted, and Machiavelli's hopes for advancement under the revived republic were frustrated, for the new government was suspicious of his ties to the Medici. Disheartened by his country's internal strife, Machiavelli fell gravely ill and died, a disillusioned man, his dream of an operational republic unrealized.
Critics have found it ironic that the fiercely republican Machiavelli should have written a handbook advising an autocratic leader how best to acquire and maintain power and security. Machiavelli was acutely aware, however, of foreign threats to Italian autonomy and thus deemed it necessary for a strong prince to thwart French and Spanish hegemony. Hence The Prince, addressed to the ruling Medici. He believed that a shrewd head of state, exemplified by Borgia, was essential to sublimating self-interest to common welfare. Since handbooks of conduct meeting monarchal needs had become immensely popular by the 1400s, the external form of The Prince was neither startling nor particularly remarkable to Machiavelli's contemporaries. Yet, from its initial appearance, The Prince proved no mere manual of protocol nor, for that matter, of even conventional strategy. In its chapters, Machiavelli delineated a typology of sovereignties and the deployment of available forces military, political, or psychological to acquire and retain them. The Prince is the first political treatise to divorce statecraft from ethics; as Machiavelli wrote:  How one lives is so far removed from how one ought to live that he who abandons what one does for what one ought to do, learns rather his own ruin than his preservation. Adding to his unflinching realism the common Renaissance belief in humanity's capacity for determining its own destiny, Machiavelli posited two fundamentals necessary for effective political leadership: virtu and fortuna. Virtu refers to the prince's own abilities (ideally a combination of leonine force and vulpine cunning); fortuna to the unpredictable influence of fortune. In a significant departure from previous political thought, the designs of Providence play no part in Machiavelli's scheme. On issues of leadership hitherto masked by other political theorists in vague diplomatic terms, Machiavelli presented his theses in direct, candid, and often passionate speech, employing easily grasped metaphors and structuring the whole in an aphoristic vein which lends it a compelling authority.
Reaction to The Prince was initially but only briefly favorable, with Catherine de' Medici said to have enthusiastically included it, among other of Machiavelli's writings, in the educational curriculum of her children. But, within a short time the book fell into widespread disfavor, becoming viewed as a handbook for atheistic tyranny. The Prince, and Machiavelli's other writings as well, were placed in the Papal Index of Prohibited Books in 1559. Further denigrated toward the close of the sixteenth century in Discours sur les moyens de bien gouverner et maintenir en paix un royause, ou autre principaute. Contre Nicolas Machiavel, florentin by Innocenzo Gentillet in France, The Prince was held responsible for French political corruption and for widespread contribution to any number of political and moral vices. Gentillet's interpretation of The Prince as advocating statecraft by ruthlessness and amoral duplicity was disseminated throughout Britain through the works of such popular, highly influential dramatists as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe. In the Prologue to Marlowe's The Jew of Malta (1589?),  Machevilli  addresses the audience at length, at one point encapsulating the Elizabethan perception of Machiavelli by saying,  "I count religion but a childish toy, / And hold there is no sin but ignorance." Here and in the works of Marlowe's contemporaries, Machiavelli was depicted as an agent of all that Protestant England despised in Catholic, High- Renaissance Italy. Hostile English interpreters so effectively typified Machiavelli as an amalgam of various evils, which they described with the still-used term " Machiavellian," that fact and fabrication still coexist today. Rarely, until the nineteenth century, did mention of The Prince elicit other than unfounded and largely unexamined repugnance, much less encourage objective scrutiny of its actual issues. As Fredi Chiappelli has aptly summarized: "Centuries had to elapse before the distinction between moral moment and political moment, between technical approach and moralistic generalities, and even between the subject matter of the book and the author's person were finally achieved."
Modern critics, noting these crucial distinctions, have engaged in a prolonged and animated discussion concerning Machiavelli's true intent in The Prince. An anomalous seventeenth-century commentator, philosopher Pierre Bayle, found it "strange" that "there are so many people, who believe, that Machiavel teaches princes dangerous politics; for on the contrary princes have taught Machiavel what he has written."  Since Bayle's time, further analysis has prompted the most prolonged and animated discussion relating to the work: the true intent of its creator. Was the treatise, as Bayle suggested, a faithful representation of princely conduct which might justifiably incriminate its subjects but not its chronicler? Or had Machiavelli, in his manner of presentation, devised the volume as a vehicle for his own commentary? Still more calculatedly, had the author superseded description in ably providing a legacy for despots? A single conclusion concerning the author's motive has not been drawn, though patterns of conjecture have certainly appeared within Machiavelli's critical heritage. Lord Macaulay, in emphasizing the writer's republican zeal and those privations he suffered in its behalf, has contended that it is "inconceivable that the martyr of freedom should have designedly acted as the apostle of tyranny," and that "the peculiar immorality which has rendered The Prince unpopular ... belonged rather to the age than to the man." Others have echoed this suggestion, examining the work in its historical context: John Addington Symonds has deemed it "simply a handbook of princecraft, as that art was commonly received in Italy, where the principles of public morality had been translated into terms of material aggrandisement, glory, gain, and greatness." Many have urged that Machiavelli intended the treatise as a veiled satiric attack on the methods of Italian tyranny or, by abstruse methods, its converse" a paean to patriotism and sensible government, grounded in a clear-sighted knowledge of the corrupt human condition. According to Harold J. Laski, The Prince "is a text-book for the house of Medici set out in the terms their own history would make them appreciate and, so set out, that its author might hope for their realization of his insight into the business of government." While ultimately unable to agree on the underlying purpose of The Prince, nearly all critics have nonetheless been persuaded of its masterful composition, even when unwilling to endorse its precepts. Macaulay has affirmed that the "judicious and candid mind of Machiavelli shows itself in his luminous, manly, and polished language." And Francesco De Sanctis has determined that "where he was quite unconscious of form, he was a master of form. Without looking for Italian prose he found it."
For sheer volume and intensity, studies of The Prince have far exceeded those directed at Machiavelli's Discourses, though the latter work has been acknowledged an essential companion piece to the former. All of the author's subsequent studies treating history, political science, and military theory stem from this voluminous dissertation containing the most original thought of Machiavelli. Less flamboyant than The Prince and narrower in its margin for interpretation, the Discourses contains Machiavelli's undisguised admiration for ancient governmental forms, and his most eloquent, thoroughly explicated republicanism. Commentators have noted the presence of a gravity and skillful rhetoric that at times punctuate The Prince but are in full evidence only in that work's final chapter, a memorable exhortation to the Medicis to resist foreign tyranny. The Discourses also presents that methodical extrapolation of political theory from historical documentation which is intermittent in The Prince. Max Lerner has observed that "if The Prince is great because it gives us the grammar of power for a government, The Discourses are great because they give us the philosophy of organic unity not in a government but in a state, and the conditions under which alone a culture can survive."
It has been deemed not at all incongruous that an intellect immersed in historical circumstance and political impetus should so naturally embrace comedy as well. For Machiavelli regarded comedy exactly as he conceived history: an interplay of forces leading unavoidably to a given result. Machiavelli's Mandragola, his only work in the comedic genre, clearly reflected this parallel. De Sanctis has remarked that "under the frivolous surface [of Mandragola] are hidden the profoundest complexities of the inner life, and the action is propelled by spiritual forces as inevitable as fate. It is enough to know the characters to guess the end."  The drama's scenario concerns Callimaco's desire to bed Lucrezia, the beautiful young wife of a doddering fool, Nicia, who is obsessed with begetting a son. Masquerading as a doctor, Callimaco advises Nicia to administer a potion of mandrake to Lucrezia to render her fertile, but also warns that the drug will have fatal implications for the first man to have intercourse with her. He slyly suggests to Nicio that a dupe be found for this purpose. Persuaded by her confessor, a knavish cleric, to comply with her husband's wishes, the virtuous Lucrezia at last allows Callimaco into her bed, where he has no difficulty convincing her to accept him as her lover on a more permanent basis. Tales of this sort" replete with transparent devices, mistaken identities, and cynical, often anticlerical overtones" were already commonplace throughout Europe by the Middle Ages, though critics have remarked that Machiavelli lent freshness to even this hackneyed material. Sydney Anglo has commended his "clear, crisp repartee" and ability "to nudge our ribs at improprieties and double-meanings,"  despite characterization that is "rudimentary, haphazard, and inconsistent, with even protagonists going through their motions like automata."  Macaulay, on the other hand, has applauded the play's "correct and vigorous delineation of human nature."
A decided influence on the philosophies of Thomas Hobbes and Sir Francis Bacon and on the thought of such modern political theorists as Vilfredo Pareto, Gaetano Mosca, Georges Sorel, and Robert Michels, Machiavelli has been called the founder of empirical political science, primarily on the strength of the Discourses and The Prince. Taken in historical perspective, it is understandable that The Prince should have dwarfed Machiavelli's other works. For with this slim treatise the author confronted the ramifications of power when its procurement and exercise were notably peremptory" not only in his own country but throughout Europe as well. Commentators have come to weigh the integrity of Machiavelli's controversial thought against the pressing political conditions which formed it. Some, like Roberto Ridolfi, have endeavored through their studies to dislodge the long- standing perception of Machiavelli as a ruthless character: "In judging Machiavelli one must ... take account of his anguished despair of virtue and his tragic sense of evil.... [On] the basis of sentences taken out of context and of outward appearances he was judged a cold and cynical man, a sneerer at religion and virtue; but in fact there is hardly a page of his writing and certainly no action of life that does not show him to be passionate, generous, ardent and basically religious." "Far from banishing religion or ethics from politics," Peter Bondanella has stated in European Writers, "Machiavelli created a new religion out of politics, with all its fateful implications for modern intellectual history."

=======================================================
Niccolo Machiavelli was born in Florence on May 3rd, 1469 during a time of great political activity in Italy. His first role in political affairs came at the young age of 29, when the ruling regime of Savonarola fell from power in his native city. Though he had no previous administrative background, Machiavelli was appointed to serve as second chancellor of the Florentine Republic under the new government. His nomination to this powerful diplomatic post was in large part due to the influence of the Italian humanists, who stressed the need for an education in the "humane disciplines" of Latin, rhetoric, classical studies, ancient history and moral philosophy - subjects in which Machiavelli excelled as a student.
The position of second chancellor included important responsibilities for the foreign and diplomatic relations of the Republic and gave Machiavelli the opportunity to travel and observe first-hand the successes and failures of leaders throughout Europe. It was from these experiences as a diplomat and ambassador that Machiavelli formed his deep convictions about the methodology of effective leadership. Indeed, from his later writings it is evident that the foundation for much of his political philosophy rested upon the lessons he drew from the diplomatic and military events of his time.Machiavelli's first assignment was on a mission to the court of Louis XII of France to appease the French leader after a disaster in their alliance against Pisa. He quickly learned that Florence's sense of its own importance was clearly at odds with the realities of its military position and relative wealth. To anyone educated in the school of modern kingship, his native government appeared vacillating and weak. Machiavelli took this embarrassment to heart and later wrote powerfully about the political necessity of military strength, the dangers of procrastination, the folly of appearing irresolute, and the need for boldness, ferocity, and tangible power.A few years later, in October of 1502, Machiavelli was sent to meet with Cesare Borgia, the duke of Romagna and an audacious and threatening military power who later demanded a formal alliance with the Florentines. It was during this time of great political turmoil and upheaval in Italy that Machiavelli drew meaningful lessons from his observation and assessment of contemporary statecraft. He was greatly impressed by Borgia, a fearless and courageous leader who possessed undivided and autonomous power, operated under conditions of extreme secrecy, and acted with swift execution. The success of his leadership resulted from his qualities of boldness, physical strength, and predatory instinct. Though he admired much of Borgia's leadership style, Machiavelli was unimpressed by his seeming overconfidence. When Borgia assumed that his maneuvering and posturing to ensure a loyal successor to the papacy would automatically result in a favorable situation, Machiavelli criticized the duke's reliance on good luck. Indeed, Machiavelli often referred to Borgia in his writings as an example of irrational reliance on chance and good fortune - a recurring theme in his later philosophical works. Machiavelli had learned that truly effective leadership required taming fortune and empowering oneself to be the master of one's own destiny.The next influential leader with whom Machiavelli interacted was Julius II, the newly elected pope. Though initially convinced that the warrior pope was destined for disaster, Machiavelli was later converted to Julius's plan of reconquering the lost papal states. The pope's sheer audacity and authority - and most importantly the absolute nature of his power - gave great hope for unexpected victory. Machiavelli admired this ferocity, but noted in later writings that "if times had come when he needed to proceed with caution, they would have brought about his downfall; for never would he have turned away from those methods to which his nature inclined him." For Machiavelli, a leader must adapt to changing circumstances and craft his strategy not merely according to his temperament, but in accordance with the most effective course of action. Indeed, the primary weakness that each of these leaders shared was a disastrous inflexibility in the face of changing conditions. It was upon this basic premise of versatility and potency that Machiavelli founded his political philosophy.Unfortunately for Machiavelli, Julius's ferocity prevailed, at least in the short run, and after his alliance with Ferdinand of Spain, the Medicis re-entered Florence and the Republic was dissolved in September of 1512. Machiavelli was formally dismissed from his post at the chancery, sentenced to imprisonment, and issued an enormous fine after being suspected of conspiring against the new Medicean government. The next year, however, Julius II died, and his successor Leo X granted a general amnesty as part of the rejoicing, freeing Machiavelli to a premature retirement at his country home.Though he lived in constant hope of re-entering the political scene, the remainder of Machiavelli's life was dedicated to writing and reflection. His lot from this time forward was to contemplate the political scene not as a participant, but as an analyst. Machiavelli became a prolific and diverse author, writing biography (Life of Castruccio Castracani), civic and social history (The History of Florence), and even what many consider to be the best Italian play of the century (Mandragola). Machiavelli is best remembered, however, for his works of political philosophy. In Discourses on Livy, Machiavelli reflects systematically on his political and diplomatic experience, the lessons of history (both contemporary and ancient), and ultimately articulates what he supposed to be the rules of statecraft.Machiavelli’s hopes of returning in a full-fledged manner to the political arena never materialized. In 1521, he published The Art of War, and in 1525 Pope Clement VII awarded him a stipend for his historical work – particularly displayed in his History of Florence, another work not published until after his death. When the Medicis were overthrown in 1527, Machiavelli’s ties to the family (through his work as historian and his other, smaller duties) rendered him suspicious in the eyes of the new government; even the restoration of the Republic did not mean Machiavelli could regain his earlier reputation. He died in San Casciano in 1527, just a few miles outside his beloved Florence.
