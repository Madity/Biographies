Kevin L. Barnes[1] (born May 30, 1974) is the singer, multi-instrumentalist, and songwriter for the indie rock group of Montreal, part of the Elephant 6 Collective.[2] Barnes started the band on his own and, although providing several stories as to the origin of the name, is said to have named it after a failed romance with a woman from Montreal. The group has recorded twelve full-length albums, and numerous EPs and 7" singles. His brother, David Barnes, is an artist and has designed most of the band's artwork for albums after the release of The Gay Parade.
In 2003, Barnes married Nina Aimee Grøttland, a former Ethnobabes member, as well as a graphic artist. They have one daughter, Alabee, born in Oslo on December 29, 2004.
of Montreal consists of musicians Kevin Barnes, Bryan Poole (the Late B.P. Helium), Dottie Alexander, Davey Pierce, Clayton Rychlik, Kaoru Ishibashi, and Nicolas Dobbratz. The group has recorded twelve studio albums, beginning with Cherry Peel, and, most recently, Lousy with Sylvianbriar, which was released on October 8, 2013 on Polyvinyl. While melodic pop has always been Barnes' primary vehicle, his style has managed to transform significantly since the 1997 release of Cherry Peel. The acoustic tendencies of early albums gradually transformed into a more electronic, funk, and overall eclectic sound. One of the features which often appears in Barnes' songwriting is his penchant for composing upbeat melodies to gloomy lyrics and morose subject matter. At different periods in the band's career he has dealt with subjects both personal and fictional. He is a prolific lyricist with a tendency to employ unusual words and phrases, as well as complicated wordplay.
Kevin Barnes' writing has encompassed many styles over the years. Of Montreal's first album Cherry Peel dealt mainly with personal issues of unrequited love, as in the songs "Baby" or "Montreal", or humorous mundane situations, as in "Tim I Wish You Were Born a Girl". His style then shifted to story-telling, often involving dialogues, as in "Good Morning Mr. Edminton" from the album Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse, or fictional characters, such as Rose Robert or Jacques Lamure, or even fictional mythological creature, like the Efeblum.[3]
The albums The Gay Parade, The Bedside Drama: A Petite Tragedy and the referred Coquelicot are constructed as concept albums, reminiscent of the works of some progressive rock icons of the 70's, such as David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust or Genesis' The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway.
By 2004, though, Barnes was starting to revert to more personal lyrics, even incorporating the names of the people close to him and using them as characters in his own songs, similar to what John Lennon or Ray Davies used to do:
Kevin Barnes explained the reasons why he felt compelled to change his writing from personal to fictional and back to personal again in an interview with the music blog You Ain't No Picasso.,[5] claiming the bad reviews his first album got prevented him from writing anything from a personal point of view until he got married and his wife gave him the strength to tackle his own issues again.
Avant-garde cinema, mentioning Luis Buñuel's Phantom of Liberty in "Lysergic Bliss", Jaromil Jireš' Valerie and Her Week of Wonders in "St. Exquisite Confessions", or Wong Kar-wai in "Rapture Rapes The Muses";
Greek mythology –"Heimdalsgate Like a Promethean Curse", "Rapture Rapes the Muses" with references to "antediluvian Troy", or his frequent use of antonomasia (Petrarch and Dido in "So Begins Our Alabee", "Cato As a Pun").

With of Montreal, Barnes has always tried to cross the bridge between his love of theater, comedy, and music, often resulting in interludes between songs - skits, slow-motion sword fights and surreal interaction between band members. However, since the release of Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?, Barnes has been performing as his on-stage glam rock alter ego, Georgie Fruit, first mentioned in "Labyrinthian Pomp".[6] The second half of the album comes after the twelve minute dark epic, "The Past Is a Grotesque Animal", a track which stands out in the album and the rest of the of Montreal repertoire because of how it succumbs to dark thoughts of suicide and chemical imbalance, themes hinted at more cheerily elsewhere on the album. Kevin has said that the album shows his transformation to Georgie Fruit, as is evident in the variation in musical style from in album leading up to "The Past Is a Grotesque Animal" and the two songs after. He has described Georgie Fruit as a black man in his forties who has undergone multiple sex changes. Georgie, Kevin told Pitchfork Media, was in a funk-rock band called Arousal back in the seventies.[7]
A Pollinaire Rave is a comedy tour by Kevin Barnes, his brother David Barnes and his wife, Nina. A CD with the same name was sold, and five of the seven songs on the EP became songs on the of Montreal album Satanic Panic in the Attic.
He also played keyboard on "The Difference in the Shades", and did the background vocals on "A Poetic Retelling of an Unfortunate Seduction" on Bright Eyes' album Letting Off the Happiness.

Hello to whoever reads this. My name is Kevin Barnes and I'm in a band called Of Montreal. We recently signed to Bar/None Records and they asked us to write our bio. I play guitar and sing. My two friends Bryan Poole and Derek Almstead sing and play bass and drums, respectively. Brian also plays in the band Elf Power.   
I guess we're part of what could be called the Athens pop music scene that includes Olivia Tremor Control, Neutral Milk Hotel, Elf Power and Julian Koster who used to be in Chocolate U.S.A. but is now working as The Music Tapes.    
We tend to do everything at home. We write at home, record at home and have our friends come over and play on our tapes. Sometimes we'll get together on Sunday nights have pot luck and play stuff we've been working on for each other.  
Of Montreal gives me the ability to live a more romantic life. Through my songs I add beauty and mystery and happiness and love and new landscapes and sadness and laughter to a life that's not very interesting by itself. My life is elevated to a better place through my songs. It's the same sort of thing that happens to me when I listen to someone else's music that I love or when I read Franz Kafka's stories or when looking at my brother's and Tim Roots drawings. They both contributed art to the package for my album. Just knowing that there is a secret world inside those people too, entering that world, being inside those worlds is when I'm most happy.    
We've got a couple of singles coming out in England (Trade 2 Singles Club) and Japan (100 Guitar Mania) and an EP on Kindercore. A second album for Bar/None called 'A Petite Tragedy' is finished but Bar/None says we have to go out and promote this one before they'll release it. So I guess I'll see you in your hometown very soon.   
"Of Montreal has written what might be the best record of the year... Kevin Barnes has shared his first major vision with the world, and we're better for having listened... suprisingly complex. Fusing the shameless fun of Jonathan Richman with the mega-melodies of the Beach Boys by way of Weezer and the Beatles. Barnes has created his own signature style by building on the strong foundations of the geniuses who have come before him."  -FLAGPOLE 
Of Montreal's second release for Bar None, The Gay Parade is a place where one can go to be in the company of funny creatures, eccentric characters and bizarre architecture. It's a strange land where people can escape to, to be happy.Of Montreal  is the brainchild of Kevin Barnes.  He resides in Athens, Georgia, and his band has long been part of the Elephant Six collective of young, prolific musicians that includes Neutral Milk Hotel, Olivia Tremor Control, Elf Power, and Music Tapes.  But Kevin spends most of his time in his exceptionally fertile imagination.  His much acclaimed Bar None debut Cherry Peel and its companion piece, the very solo A Petite Tragedy (released on Kindercore), were hailed for their whimsy and cheerfulness but, for Kevin, they remain melancholy  works, the aftermath of a romantic breakup.  In fact, the unusual band name he chose was a reaction to heartache: he fell in love with a girl from Montreal, they parted badly, and henceforth his band would commemorate the ill-fated relationship because "I would be affected by the experience forever."  Kevin is a guy who knows how to savor his sadness. The Gay Parade, on the other hand, is an escape from the everyday, from disappointment and disillusion and the dangerous unpredictability of love.  
Happy, in some hands, can be dull and not half as musically exciting as misery.  But Kevin is uniquely equipped to create a psychedelic sort of sincerity that can be far more moving than moping.  As Raygun has put it, Of Montreal dare "to sing gentle songs filled with sweet acceptance while all around them grumble and moan."  Kevin shares with his Elephant Six buddies, many of whom appear on this album, a love for a homegrown style of recording that is the aural equivalent of outsider art: the techniques may be primitive but the results are  vivid soundscapes where no instrument or idea is unwelcome.   
All of these Athens acts operate happily on the fringes of modern rock, which makes them as unclassifiable as they are cool, and Of Montreal are perhaps the most radically unfashionable.  Kevin has more in common with artists from an older generation like Ray Davies, Jonathan Richman, and even Jimmy Webb, than with his contemporaries.  And it's no surprise that he adores Brian Wilson, especially from Wilson's flaky but farsighted period when he tried to construct his monumental Smile.   
"Even though people might think the lyrics are cheesy, I always loved the '60s music the best," Kevin revealed to a reporter after he released Cherry Peel.  "That was a time when people were writing really innocent songs.  That's my favorite style of writing -- the innocent stuff.  Brian Wilson is the man -- I love him the most of all musicians.  There aren't too many people around who are as completely honest as he was -- honesty goes in and out of style."   
Kevin also cites Marshmallow Coast, Kevin Ayers, and the Brazilian cult combo Os Mutantes.  Of Montreal has its own notable fans, too;  cool Japanese mixmaster Cornelius cites A Petite Tragedy as one of his favorite albums of '98.  The Gay Parade is, in its way, a concept album (that, unlike Smile, made it out of Kevin's bedroom in one piece).  The story begins with the remarkable cover art that serves as a day-glo visual companion to the tunes.   It was created by an artist calling himself Lecithin Emulsifier, but who happens to be Barnes' brother David.  (In the album credits David's contributions are listed as "inspiring everything and shouting from the bathroom.") Within forty-four fast-paced and musically dazzling minutes, Kevin assumes an alter-ego named Claude Robert  --- this obviously runs in the family -- and introduces a cast of characters that he promises to develop further on future records. Kevin likes to think of each song as a float in a parade, an image that came to him while watching passing traffic, and all of the tunes blend together into a seamless and colorful whole.  
Kevin plans to take Of Montreal back on the road this spring.  Although his work is very personal, he hasn't shied away from touring and has found receptive audiences everywhere.  This time Kevin wants to put on a more theatrical show and promises to "go overboard" with it, a sentiment much in keeping with The Gay Parade.  
In a period of dour corporate culture and assembly-line acts, Kevin is blissfully out of step with his times, but he does invite everyone to follow the beat of his own unique drummer: "We're all marchers in the parade and you can march too."  
He intends to inspire.  As he once told a journalist, "I'm hoping there will be a whole new movement where everybody records at home and everything gets done in a really personal way and there's no more cheesy band bios that need to be passed around. And everybody can do it on their own exactly how they want to do it."  
So enough biographying.  Let Kevin speak for himself.  You can probably already hear the sound of the parade approaching....  
Of Montreal is the name the efeblum gave Kevin Barnes' musical endeavors a derby hat to sit in.  What does that sentence mean?  What is an efeblum?  An efeblum is similar in many ways to a fairy, like Tinkerbell.  They are employed by loving spirits to place bells inside of people's hearts.  When a person's heart is in possession of a bell they are able to receive and reciprocate love, create works of art, and feel genuinely happy all around.  Kevin has a very precious efeblum named Coquelicot who cares for him personally.  He'll tell you more about her in the future.   Here is the story of how the Gay Parade came to exist:  
One day Kevin was sitting on his hands watching the traffic and feeling blue because Julie the Mouse didn't love him.  Coquelicot fluttered up close to his ear and whispered that he should use his imagination to escape from his melancholy.  She convinced him that his day would be more agreeable if instead of watching traffic and pining for a lost mouse he was participating in a parade.  Kevin agreed with her.  In his mind he slowed down the cars so that they were driving at a speed appropriate for a parade.  He proceeded to imagine each car as a float in the parade. Next he created stories that would be acted out on each float.  The floats were so beautiful and the stories so entertaining that Kevin became overwhelmed with joy.  He forgot all about the mouse and only digressed into sadness once during the parade and that was because he wished he had a special friend to share the experience with.  After the last float passed and the final story was told Kevin received a wonderful gift.  A very silly gentleman named Lecithin Emulsifier endowed him with the ability to relive this incredible day as often as he wished.  Kevin wished to do so quite often and in fact spent so much time watching the parade   he decided he should just join the parade and stay there permanently. This was a good idea.  Kevin invented a new identity for himself.  He changed his name to Claude Robert.  As Claude he rediscovered the all encompassing gaiety he felt before being born.  He named the parade the Gay Parade to symbolize this.   
With the assistance of Coquelicot, Claude Robert was able to bring  the Gay Parade into other people's imaginations and fill their hearts with bells of gaiety.  The parade has become larger and larger over time as many people like Kevin prefer the freedom and magic of the Gay Parade over the slow monotony of their previous lives.  It is Claude's dream that one day each living creature will join the parade and be happy there.  I hope his dream is realized. 
Can anything possibly live up to the title of the new full-length album from the Athens, Georgia band, Of Montreal? Only the indispensable collection of songs that appear on the band's latest release, Horse and Elephant Eatery (elephants not allowed): the Singles and Songles Album.  
Spanning their entire career, Singles and Songles brings us more of that dream-like pop magic from Kevin Barnes and Co. This new album pulls together new songs, b-sides and bonus tracks from far-flung continents. There are old favorites like "The Problem with April", "Buried with Me" (previously only available on vinyl) and newbies like "Ira's Brief Life as a Spider" and "The World Keeps Going 'Round" (a great Kinks cover). Now all these tracks can finally be found in one place.   
Of Montreal is turning into a veritable Athens, Georgia supergroup as bandmate Dottie Alexander steps out with her combo, My First Keyboard, and Andy Gonzales' band, Marshmallow Coast, prepares for a second release. Drummer Jamie Huggins' side project, The Great Lakes, has also recently released their first album, while bassist Derek Almstead began playing for the band, Summer Hymns.   
Meanwhile, they have been working steadily for the last year on what is supposed to be Of Montreal's most ambitious project to date. Coquelicot asleep with the poppies; a variety of whimsical verse. The album is a long sprawling work that moves past the tight short pop song format the band has previously utilized, into more ambitious terrain. (But don't worry--you'll still be able to sing along). They plan to package it like a book and make a film that will accompany the group on tour. Rumor has it this will be followed by a more straight ahead rock 'n roll album (Get back JoJo!)   
Till then, enjoy Singles and Songles. It portrays every wonderful side of this group's collective imagination.

Ever since the golden days of R.E.M. and the B-52's, Athens, Georgia, has been a hotbed for diverse and forward thinking music, one that often benefits from a tight group of musicians, sewn together with the common idea of pushing the envelope of pop music. In the mid-1990s a group of musicians called the Elephant Six---consisting of bands like Apples in Stereo, Olivia Tremor Control, Neutral Milk Hotel and Elf Power---began producing a mixed bag of swirling psychedelia and straight-forward power pop, that snapped and crackled under the umbrella of their tight-knit collective. One such anomaly, however, is Kevin Barnes and his cartoonish, carnival-esque pop outfit Of Montreal. Though Barnes is connected to many of his Elephant Six brethren (even playing with other bands like the Marshmallow Coast and the Great Lakes) Of Montreal has always functioned as their own entity within the context of the collective---Barnes makes wildly weird pop music, but he does it on his own terms. Highly prolific, Of Montreal has released a number of albums, EPs, and singles for labels like Kindercore, Bar/None, and Polyvinyl, all containing Barnes' distinct kaleidoscope of pop influences, moving from Beach Boys-esque kitsch to bouncy and eclectic pop-tronica, filled with expressive harmonies, a toy chest of instruments and Barnes strange, story-like lyrics.
If there is one thing Barnes is unable to do, it is settle in one place for too long. Originally from Athens, his worldly trek led him to Montreal, Quebec, in Canada. After a failed romance with a woman from Montreal, Barnes picked up and moved to Florida, where he began making home recordings and demo tapes under the moniker Of Montreal. The strength of these tapes caught the attention of indie label Bar/None Records, home to the Mendoza Line and Epic Soundtracks, amongst a gaggle of others. After signing to Bar/None, Barnes moved to Cleveland, and then to Minneapolis, searching for the right people to round out the Of Montreal lineup. His search was coming up empty, so he decided to move back to Athens, where the Elephant Six collective had begun to gain momentum (thanks to the release of the Olivia Tremor Control's Music from the Unrealized Film Script, Dusk at Cubist Castle, released in 1996, and Apples in Stereo's 1997 album Tone Soul Evolution). Back in Athens, Barnes hooked up with bassist Bryan Helium, also of the Athens-based band Elf Power, and drummer Derek Almstead. Once their lineup was complete, the band recorded and released their debut album, Cherry Peel, for Bar/None in 1997.
In a bio written for Bar/None, Barnes laid out the simplistic recording technique, as well as explained a little bit about himself, saying, "We tend to do everything at home. We write at home, record at home and have our friends come over and play on our tapes. Sometimes we'll get together on Sunday nights have pot luck and play stuff we've been working on for each other. Of Montreal gives me the ability to live a more romantic life. Through my songs I add beauty and mystery and happiness and love and new landscapes and sadness and laughter to a life that's not very interesting by itself. My life is elevated to a better place through my songs."
The world that Barnes enters when making music as Of Montreal is nothing short of colorful and catchy, almost representing the musical equivalent of the Candyland board game mixed in with only the best influences from the '60s---the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Kinks. After the release of Cherry Peel, Barnes issued an EP for Athens indie-pop label Kindercore---home to bands like Japancakes, Masters of the Hemisphere, and the Essex Green---called The Bird Who Continues to Eat the Rabbit's Flower, released in 1998. Following this short EP, Of Montreal's lineup evolved, after Helium left to concentrate more of his time on Elf Power. Almstead took over his bass duties, while they added keyboardist Dottie Alexander and drummer Jamie Huggins to the mix. Although the lineup was more concrete, Barnes took much of the Of Montreal's second full length on himself. Released in 1998 for Kindercore, The Bedside Drama: A Petite Tragedy was essentially a Kevin Barnes solo album under the Of Montreal moniker. Splendidezine.com's Noah Wane said, "It may not be a little bit of country or a little bit of rock 'n' roll, but what it is is a little bit of McCartney/Lennon and a little bit of Brian Wilson. If you ever wondered what a mating of The White Album and Pet Sounds would spawn, then The Bedside Drama A Petite Tragedy will be like a response to a long unanswered question... Tender pop music fans...this one is a must!"
Not one to stop or settle, Barnes revived his relationship with Bar/None for what would be his most critically acclaimed album yet--1999's The Gay Parade. Joined by his bandmates, as well as a new member, multi-instrumentalist A.C. Forrester, The Gay Parade furthered Barnes carnival-esque take on pop music, prompting Popmatters to say, "With a treasure trove of loopy Yellow Submarine and Sgt. Peppers characterizations, Beatles/Small Faces/Ray Davies/Brian Wilson musical references, and a vaudevillian sensibility, The Gay Parade comes across as nothing short of a brilliant lost 1960s concept album." With Neutral Milk Hotel's In the Aeroplane Over the Sea (Merge, 1998) and the Olivia Tremor Control's Black Foliage: Animation Music (Flydaddy, 1999) causing a stir in the press, the time was right for Barnes to release such an ambitious and exciting slice of pop under the Elephant Six imprint. Nudeasthenews.com said, "The record shares many features with those of E6 mates Neutral Milk Hotel and Olivia Tremor Control. For starters, The Gay Parade utilizes the junk-orchestra assemblage of instruments often found on those band's albums, and of course the recording features guest appearances from E6 notaries (NMH's Jeff Mangum is credited with 'holding hands while jumping on the furnace'). The mere appearance of 'The Marching Theme For The Gay Parade' should seem familiar to fans of E6 records. [But] Of Montreal revels in more straightforward pop than some of its compatriots. Songwriter and principal musician Kevin Barnes' voice controls the record, much like Mangum's holds NMH's records together, providing a consistent theme for the melodic lines, even though scores of different instruments might pop up on any given song."
After the success of The Gay Parade, an interest started to amass for Of Montreal's harder to find material. A collection of the band's singles, called Horse & Elephant Eatery (No Elephants Allowed): The Singles & Songles Album, was released by Bar/None in 2000; Kindercore followed up a year later with The Early 4-Track Recordings, as well as Earworm Records' An Introduction to Of Montreal. But, demand for new material prompted Barnes and company to return with Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse, released by Kindercore in 2001. Pitchforkmedia.com's Matt Lemay said, "When the record's at its best, the group incorporates more diverse elements into their music than ever before. 'Good Morning Mr. Edminton,' Coquelicot's opener, is a typical Of Montreal song in prime form. Fuzzed-out guitar, bouncy piano, and multitracked harmonies by front man Kevin Barnes set the stage for a demented tale of kidnapping and working class struggle as told, of course, from the kidnapper's point of view. 'The Peacock Parasols,' which features a truly unforgettable, cryptic, and quite possibly misspelled lyric referring to 'P.P. icycles,' goes from a pop song in warp drive to a dense, orchestral middle, and back."
With the release of Coquelicot, Barnes started to pull away a bit from the sunshiny backdrop he'd created for Of Montreal, as well as from the niche he'd established as part of the Athens scene, stating to Chicago Innerview Magazine, "I could care less about Athens's past. It is just the place where I happen to be living at the moment." He started to branch out musically, incorporating creepier and more twisted pop elements, as well as inject some more worldly influences, such as the work of Os Mutantes. For his next full length, Aldhils Arboretum (released on Kindercore in 2002), Barnes started to further explore his knack for writing dark lyrics that accompanied hyperactive, major-key pop songs. Stylusmagazine.com said, "Delivered in a culture that is hungry for black humor, these musical stories would lead one to believe they are sung in jest. But Kevin Barnes' career-spanning use of dark subject matter makes you wonder: is it presumptuous to assume sadness can't be expressed through major-keyed, richly textured musical medians?"
However, it was in the years 2004 and 2005 that Barnes started to flip the Beach Boys and Beatles comparisons upsidedown, recording two albums of fun, slightly dark, but all together unpredictable electronic pop on his computer. After marrying his wife Nina (who would eventually join Of Montreal's touring outfit) in 2003, Barnes set to work on crafting his version of dance music, mostly by himself at home. He told Aversion.com, "Before I was limiting myself (and) thinking it was funny, but it's really not funny," he says. "You have many different levels of your personality and it's good to explore all those levels. I wanted to do something that was kind of like if Brian Eno produced a Prince album." And so, with a host of new influences, including the folktronica of Four Tet and Caribou, the hip-hop work of Jay-Z, OutKast, Missy Elliott, and Timbaland, and a newfound interest in dub music, Barnes released Satanic Panic in the Attic for Polyvinyl Records in 2004. Appealing to a whole new audience, Satanic Panic was a critical smash, with Pitchforkmedia.com's Sam Ubi giving the album an 8.3 out of 10.
He followed the album up with The Sunlandic Twins, released by Polyvinyl in 2005. Prefixmagazine.com said, "this album offers enough pop hooks, vocal harmonies and sudden key changes to make it perfect for the beach. The most danceable track, 'Wraith Pinned to the Mist and Other Games,' will, like so many others on the album, stay in your head for days. With all that The Sunlandic Twins offers for delightful consumption (at least until next year, when a newly transformed Of Montreal will release another album), this is one history and philosophy lesson likely to make starving artists shake their booties."
Group formed by Barnes in Athens, GA, 1997; released Cherry Peel on Bar/None, 1997; released first album on Athens-based label Kindercore The Bedside Drama: A Petite Tragedy, 1998; continued to release albums on Kindercore and Bar/None, late 1990s-early 2000s; signed to Polyvinyl Records and released Satanic Panic in the Attic, 2004; released The Sunlandic Twins on Polyvinyl, 2005.
