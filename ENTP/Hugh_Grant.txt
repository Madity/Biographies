=======================================================
Hugh John Mungo Grant[1] (born 9 September 1960)[2] is an English actor and film producer. He has received a Golden Globe, a BAFTA, and a Honorary César. His films have earned more than US$2.4 billion from 25 theatrical releases worldwide.[3] Grant achieved international success after appearing in the Richard Curtis-scripted Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994).[4] He used this breakthrough role as a frequent cinematic persona during the 1990s, delivering comic performances in mainstream films like Mickey Blue Eyes (1999) and Notting Hill (1999). By the turn of the 21st century, he had established himself as a leading man skilled with a satirical comic talent.[5] Grant has expanded his oeuvre with critically acclaimed turns as a cad in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), About a Boy (2002), and American Dreamz (2006).[6] He later played against type with multiple cameo roles in the epic drama film Cloud Atlas (2012).
Within the film industry, Grant is cited as an anti-film star who approaches his roles like a character actor, and attempts to make his acting appear spontaneous.[7] Hallmarks of his comic skills include a nonchalant touch of irony/sarcasm and studied physical mannerisms as well as his precisely-timed dialogue delivery and facial expressions. The entertainment media's coverage of Grant's life off the big screen has often overshadowed his work as a thespian.[8][9] He has been vocal about his disrespect for the profession of acting, and in his disdain towards the culture of celebrity and hostility towards the media.[10][11] In a career spanning 30 years, Grant has repeatedly claimed that acting is not a true calling but just a job he fell into.[12]
Grant was born at Charing Cross Hospital in Hammersmith, London, the second son of Fynvola Susan MacLean (b. Wickham, Hampshire, 11 October 1933; d. Hounslow, London, July 2001)[13] and Captain James Murray Grant (b. 1929). Genealogist Antony Adolph has described Grant's family history as "a colourful Anglo-Scottish tapestry of warriors, empire-builders and aristocracy,"[14] including William Drummond, 4th Viscount Strathallan and Dr. James Stewart.[14][15][16] John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl, Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham, Rt. Hon. Sir Evan Nepean, and a sister of former British Prime Minister Spencer Perceval, are a few of his notable maternal ancestors.[17] Grant's grandfather, Major James Murray Grant, DSO was decorated for bravery and leadership at Saint-Valery-en-Caux during World War II.[18]
Grant's father was trained at Sandhurst, Berkshire and served with the Seaforth Highlanders for eight years in Malaya, Germany and Scotland.[19] He ran a carpet firm, pursued hobbies such as golf and painting watercolours, and raised his family in Chiswick, west London, where the Grants lived next to Arlington Park Mansions on Sutton Lane.[20][21] In September 2006, a collection of Capt. Grant's paintings was hosted by the John Martin Gallery in a charity exhibition, organised by his famous son, called "James Grant: 30 Years of Watercolours."[22] His mother worked as a schoolteacher and taught Latin, French and music for more than 30 years in the state schools of west London.[23] She died at the age of 65,[13] 18 months after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.[24]
Grant's accent is an inheritance from his mother and, on Inside the Actors Studio in 2002, he credited her with "any acting genes that [he] might have."[21] Both his parents were children of military families,[25] but, despite his parents' backgrounds, Grant has stated that his family was not always affluent while he was growing up.[26] Grant spent his childhood summers shooting and hunting with his grandfather in Scotland.[20] Grant's elder brother, James "Jamie" Grant, is a successful banker as managing director, Head of Healthcare, Consumer, & Retail Investment Banking Coverage, at JPMorgan Chase in New York.[27]
Grant started his education at Hogarth Primary School in Chiswick but then moved to St Peter's Primary School in Hammersmith. From 1969 to 1978, he attended the independent Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith on a scholarship and played 1st XV rugby, cricket and football for the school.[28][29] He also represented Latymer on the popular quiz show, Top of the Form, an academic competition between two teams of four secondary school students each.[30] In 1979, he won the Galsworthy scholarship to New College, Oxford where he starred in his first film, Privileged, produced by the Oxford University Film Foundation, OUFF. He studied English literature and graduated with 2:1 honours.[31] Actress Anna Chancellor, who met Grant while she was still at school, has recalled, "I first met Hugh at a party at Oxford. There was something magical about him. He was a star even then, without having done anything."[32] He received an offer from the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London to pursue a PhD in the history of art, but decided not to take the offer because he failed to secure a grant. Viewing acting as nothing more than a creative outlet,[33] he joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society and starred in a successful touring production of Twelfth Night.[34] Hugh Grant funds The Fynvola Grant Scholarship at Latymer Upper School in memory of his mother who was a teacher in West London.
After making his debut as Hughie Grant in the Oxford-financed Privileged (1982), Grant dabbled in a variety of jobs: he wrote book reviews,[citation needed] worked as assistant groundsman at Fulham Football Club,[35] tried his hand at tutoring, wrote comedy sketches for TV shows,[36] and was hired by Talkback Productions to write and produce radio commercials for products such as Mighty White bread and Red Stripe lager.[37] To obtain his Equity card, he joined the Nottingham Playhouse, a regional theatre, and lived for a year at Park Terrace in The Park Estate, Nottingham.[38] Bored with small acting parts, he created his own comedy revue called The Jockeys of Norfolk with friends Chris Lang and Andy Taylor. The group toured London's pub comedy circuit with stops at The George IV in Chiswick, Canal Cafe Theatre in Little Venice and The King's Head in Islington.[citation needed] Starting on a low note, The Jockeys of Norfolk eventually proved a hit at the Edinburgh Festival after their sketch on the Nativity, told as an Ealing comedy, gained them a spot on the BBC2 TV show called Edinburgh Nights.[citation needed] During this time, Grant also appeared in theatre productions of plays such as An Inspector Calls, Lady Windermere's Fan, and Coriolanus.
Grant's first leading film role came in Merchant-Ivory's Edwardian drama, Maurice (1987), adapted from E. M. Forster's novel. He and co-star James Wilby shared the Volpi Cup for best actor at the Venice Film Festival for their portrayals of lovers Clive Durham and Maurice Hall, respectively. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Grant balanced small roles on television with rare film work, which included a supporting role in The Dawning (1988), opposite Anthony Hopkins and Jean Simmons and a turn as Lord Byron in a Goya Award-winning Spanish production called Remando al viento (1988). He also portrayed some other real life figures during his early career such as Charles Heidsieck in Champagne Charlie and as Hugh Cholmondeley in BAFTA Award-nominated White Mischief.
In 1990, he made a cameo appearance in the sport/crime drama The Big Man, opposite Liam Neeson, and in which Grant assumed a Scottish accent. The film explores the life of a Scottish miner (Neeson) who becomes unemployed during a union strike. In 1991, he played Julie Andrews' gay son in the ABC made-for-television film Our Sons.
In 1992, he appeared in Roman Polanski's film Bitter Moon, portraying a fastidious and proper British tourist who is married, but finds himself enticed by the sexual hedonism of a seductive French woman and her embittered, paraplegic American husband. The film was called an "anti-romantic opus of sexual obsession and cruelty" by the Washington Post.[39] His other work in period pieces such as Ken Russell’s horror film, The Lair of the White Worm (1988), award-winning Merchant-Ivory drama The Remains of the Day (1993) and (as Frédéric Chopin in) Impromptu (1991) went largely unnoticed. He later called this phase of his career "hilarious," referring to his early films as "Europuddings, where you would have a French script, a Spanish director, and English actors. The script would usually be written by a foreigner, badly translated into English. And then they'd get English actors in, because they thought that was the way to sell it to America."[40]
At 32, Grant claimed to be on the brink of giving up the acting profession but was surprised by the script of Four Weddings and a Funeral (FWAAF).[5] "If you read as many bad scripts as I did, you'd know how grateful you are when you come across one where the guy actually is funny," he later recalled.[4] Released in 1994, FWAAF became the highest-grossing British film to date with a worldwide box office in excess of $244 million,[41] making Grant an overnight international star. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, and among numerous awards won by its cast and crew, it earned Grant his first and only Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. It also temporarily typecast him as the lead character, Charles, a bohemian and debonair bachelor. Grant and Curtis saw it as an inside joke that the star, due to the parts he played, was assumed to have the personality of the screenwriter, who is known for writing about himself and his own life.[40][42] Grant later expressed:
Grant in his breakthrough performance as Richard Curtis's alter ego, Charles, in Four Weddings and a Funeral
Although I owe whatever success I've had to Four Weddings and a Funeral, it did become frustrating after a bit that people made two assumptions: One was that I was that character – when in fact nothing could be further from the truth, as I'm sure Richard would tell you – and the other frustrating thing was that they thought that's all I could do. I suppose, because those films happened to be successful, no one, perhaps understandably, ... bothered to rent all the other films I'd done.[5]
In July 1994, Grant signed a two-year production deal with Castle Rock Entertainment and by October, he became founder and director of the UK-based Simian Films Limited.[43] He appointed his then-girlfriend, Elizabeth Hurley, as the head of development to look for prospective projects. Simian Films produced two Grant vehicles in the 1990s and lost a bid to produce About a Boy to Robert De Niro's TriBeCa Productions.[44] The company closed its US office in 2002 and Grant resigned as director in December 2005.[45] Grant was one of the choices to play James Bond in 1995's GoldenEye, but eventually lost out to Pierce Brosnan.
Grant's first studio-financed Hollywood project was Chris Columbus's comedy Nine Months. Though a hit at the box office, it was almost universally panned by critics. The Washington Post called it a "grotesquely pandering caper" and singled out Grant's performance, as a child psychiatrist reacting unfavourably to his girlfriend's unexpected pregnancy, for his "insufferable muggings."[46] The same year, he played leading roles as Emma Thompson's suitor in Ang Lee’s Academy Award-winning adaptation of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility and as a cartographer in 1917 Wales in The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain. In the same year he performed in the Academy Award-winning Restoration.
Before the release of Four Weddings and a Funeral, Grant reunited with its director, Mike Newell, for the tragicomedy An Awfully Big Adventure that was labelled a "determinedly off-beat film" by The New York Times.[47] Grant portrayed a bitchy, supercilious director of a repertory company in post-World War II Liverpool. Critic Roger Ebert wrote, "It shows that he has range as an actor,"[48] but the San Francisco Chronicle disapproved on grounds that the film "plays like a vanity production for Grant."[49] Janet Maslin, praising Grant as "superb" and "a dashing cad under any circumstances," commented, "For him this film represents the road not taken. Made before Four Weddings and a Funeral was released, it captures Mr. Grant as the clever, versatile character actor he was then becoming, rather than the international dreamboat he is today."[47] Grant made his debut as a film producer with the 1996 thriller Extreme Measures, a commercial and critical failure.
After a three-year hiatus, in 1999 he paired with Julia Roberts in Notting Hill, which was brought to theatres by much of the same team that was responsible for Four Weddings and a Funeral. This new Working Title production displaced Four Weddings and a Funeral as the biggest British hit in the history of cinema, with earnings equalling $363 million worldwide.[41] As it became exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture, the film was also received well by critics. CNN reviewer Paul Clinton said, "Notting Hill stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds."[50] Reactions to Grant's Golden Globe-nominated performance were varied, with Salon.com's Stephanie Zacharek criticising that, "Grant's performance stands as an emblem of what's wrong with Notting Hill. What's maddening about Grant is that he just never cuts the crap. He's become one of those actors who's all shambling self-caricature, from his twinkly crow's feet to the time-lapsed half century it takes him to actually get one of his lines out."[51] The film provided both its stars a chance to satirise the woes of international notoriety, most noted of which was Grant's turn as a faux-journalist who sits through a dull press junket with, what the New York Times called, "a delightfully funny deadpan."[52] Grant also released his second production output, a fish-out-of-water mob comedy Mickey Blue Eyes, that year. It was dismissed by critics, performed modestly at the box office, and garnered its actor-producer mixed reviews for his starring role. Roger Ebert thought, "Hugh Grant is wrong for the role [and] strikes one wrong note and then another,"[53] whereas Kenneth Turan, writing in the Los Angeles Times, said, "If he'd been on the Titanic, fewer lives would have been lost. If he'd accompanied Robert Scott to the South Pole, the explorer would have lived to be 100. That's how good Hugh Grant is at rescuing doomed ventures."[54]
While promoting Woody Allen's Small Time Crooks on NBC's The Today Show in 2000, Grant told host Matt Lauer, "It's my millennium of bastards".[55] In 2000, Grant also joined the Supervisory Board of IM Internationalmedia AG, the powerful Munich-based film and media company.[56]
Giving his most critically acclaimed performance to date, Grant plays Snooker as Will Freeman in About a Boy.
Small Time Crooks starred Grant, in the words of film critic Andrew Sarris, as "a petty, petulant, faux-Pygmalion art dealer, David, [who] is one of the sleaziest and most unsympathetic characters Mr. Allen has ever created."[57] In a role devoid of his comic attributes, the New York Times wrote: "Mr. Grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of charm and nasty calculation."[58] A year later, his turn as a charming but womanising book publisher Daniel Cleaver in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) was proclaimed by Variety to be "as sly an overthrow of a star's polished posh – and nice – poster image as any comic turn in memory".[59] The film, adapted from Helen Fielding's novel of the same name, was an international hit, earning $281 million worldwide.[41] Grant was, according to the Washington Post, fitting as "a cruel, manipulative cad, hiding behind the male god's countenance that he knows all too well".[60]
Grant's "immaculate comic performance" (BBC) as the trust-funded womaniser, Will Freeman, in the film adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling novel About a Boy received raves from critics.[61] Almost universally praised, with an Academy Award-nominated screenplay, About a Boy (2002) was determined by the Washington Post to be "that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure, prickly independence over fetishised coupledom, and honesty over typical Hollywood endings."[62] Rolling Stone wrote, "The acid comedy of Grant's performance carries the film [and he] gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs,"[63] while Roger Ebert observed that "the Cary Grant department is understaffed, and Hugh Grant shows here that he is more than a star, he is a resource."[64] Released a day after the blockbuster Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, About a Boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful Grant films, making all of $129 million globally.[41] The film earned Grant his third Golden-Globe nomination, while the London Film Critics Circle named Grant its Best British Actor and GQ honoured him as one of the magazine's men of the year 2006.[65] "His performance can only be described as revelatory," wrote critic Ann Hornaday, adding that "Grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire, terror, ambivalence and self-awareness."[62] The New York Observer concluded: "[The film] gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of Hugh Grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for words-and with an English accent besides. In the end, the film comes over as a messy delight, thanks to the skill, generosity and good-sport, punching-bag panache of Mr. Grant's performance."[66] About a Boy also marked a notable change in Grant's boyish look. Now 41, he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair. Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman took note of Grant's maturation in his review, saying he looked noticeably older and that it "looked good on him."[67] He added that Grant's "pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn, and the eyes that used to peer with 'love me' cuteness now betray a shark's casual cunning. Everything about him is leaner and spikier (including his hair, which has been shorn and moussed into a Eurochic bed-head mess), but it's not just his surface that's more virile; the nervousness is gone, too. Hugh Grant has grown up, holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherry-club mannerisms that were once his signature. In doing so, he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silver-tongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency."[67]
Grant was also paired with Sandra Bullock in Warner Bros.'s Two Weeks Notice, which made $199 million internationally but was judged poorly by professional reviewers.[41] The Village Voice concluded that Grant's creation of a spoiled billionaire fronting a real estate business was "little more than a Britishism machine."[68]
Two Weeks Notice was followed by the 2003 ensemble comedy, Love Actually, headlined by Grant as the British Prime Minister. A Christmas release by Working Title Films, the film was promoted as "the ultimate romantic comedy" and accumulated $246 million at the international box office.[41] It marked the directorial debut of Richard Curtis, who told the New York Times that Grant adamantly tempered the characterisation of the role to make his character more authoritative and less haplessly charming than earlier Curtis incarnations.[69] Roger Ebert claimed that "Grant has flowered into an absolutely splendid romantic comedian" and has "so much self-confidence that he plays the British prime minister as if he took the role to be a good sport."[70] Film critic Rex Reed, on the contrary, called Grant's performance "an oversexed bachelor spin on Tony Blair" as the star "flirted with himself in the paroxysm of self-love that has become his acting style."[71]
A speech delivered by Grant in Love Actually – where he extols the virtues of Great Britain and refuses to cave to the pressure of its longstanding ally, the United States – was etched in the transatlantic memory as a satirical, wishful statement on the concurrent Bush-Blair relationship.[72] Blair responded by saying, "I know there's a bit of us that would like me to do a Hugh Grant in Love Actually and tell America where to get off. But the difference between a good film and real life is that in real life there's the next day, the next year, the next lifetime to contemplate the ruinous consequences of easy applause."[73]
In 2004, Grant reprised his role as Daniel Cleaver for a small part in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, which, like its predecessor, made more than $262 million commercially.[41] Gone from the screen for two years, Grant next reteamed with Paul Weitz (About a Boy) for the black comedy American Dreamz (2006). Grant starred as the acerbic host of an American Idol-like reality show where, according to Caryn James of the New York Times, "nothing is real ... except the black hole at the centre of the host's heart, as Mr. Grant takes Mr. Cowell's villainous act to its limit."[74] American Dreamz failed financially but Grant was generously praised. He played his self-aggrandising character, an amalgam of Simon Cowell and Ryan Seacrest, with smarmy self-loathing. The Boston Globe proposed that this "just may be the great comic role that has always eluded Hugh Grant,"[75] and critic Carina Chocano said, "He is twice as enjoyable as the preening bad guy as he was as the bumbling good guy."[76]
In 2007, Grant starred opposite Drew Barrymore in a parody of pop culture and the music industry called Music and Lyrics. The Associated Press described it as "a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy that's simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough."[77] Though he neither listens to music nor owns any CDs,[25] Grant learned to sing, play the piano, dance (a few mannered steps) and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare for his role as a has-been pop singer, based loosely on Andrew Ridgeley.[10] The Star-Ledger dismissed the performance, writing that "paper dolls have more depth."[78] The film, with its revenues totalling $145 million, allowed Grant to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washed-up lead character. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, "Grant strikes precisely the right note with regard to Alex's career: He's too intelligent not to be a little embarrassed, but he's far too brazen to feel anything like shame."[79] In 2009, Grant starred opposite Sarah Jessica Parker in the romantic comedy Did You Hear About the Morgans?, which was a commercial as well as a critical failure.[80]
Grant is well known for having a very strong work ethic. He has called being a successful actor a mistake and has repeatedly talked of his hope that film stardom would just be "a phase" in his life, lasting no more than ten years.[40] He pins his lack of interest in acting on two different thoughts: first, that he drifted into the job as a temporary joke at age 23 and finds it an immature way for a grown man to spend his time;[81] and secondly, because he believes to have already given the one remarkable comic performance he had hoped to create on screen.[82] A self-confessed "committed and passionate" perfectionist on a film set,[12] Grant has constantly opted to describe himself as a reluctant actor, who chooses to be neutral about his career and works mostly with friends from previous collaborations.[7][83] Richard Curtis, a frequent collaborator, revealed that Grant is not fluid about the filmmaking process and tends to be unrelaxed while filming because he does not feel as though he's in the director's hands and prefers instead to take responsibility for giving a definitive performance.[10] Grant is noted by co-workers for demanding endless takes until he achieves the desired shot according to his own standard.[84][85]
A 2007 Vogue profile of Grant referred to him as a man with a "professionally misanthropic mystique."[10] The observation followed published facts such as that Grant conducts his interviews alone (without any publicists),[86] and has derided focus groups, market research and over-riding emphasis on the opening weekend.[87] Grant decided to let go of his agent in 2006, ending a 10-year relationship with CAA.[88] Besides proudly proclaiming in interviews to have never listened to external views on his career, he stated that he does not require the hand-holding an agent provides.[10] A few months before firing his agent, he said, "They've known for years that I have total control. I've never taken any advice on anything."[82]
He has stuck to the genre of comedy, especially the romantic comedy, for almost all of his mainstream film career. He also never ventures to play characters who are not British. While some film critics, such as Roger Ebert, have defended the limited variety of his performances, others have dismissed him as a one-trick pony. Eric Fellner, co-owner of Working Title Films and a long-time collaborator of Grant, said, "His range hasn't been fully tested, but each performance is unique."[89] A majority of Grant's popular films in the 1990s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love, often with an American woman. In earlier films, Grant was adept at plugging into the stereotype of a repressed Englishman for humorous effects, allowing him to gently satirise his characters as he summed them up and played against the type simultaneously.[38] These performances were sometimes deemed overbearing, in the words of Washington Post's Rita Kempley, due to his "comic overreactions—the mugging, the stuttering, the fluttering eyelids." She added: "He's got more tics than Benny Hill."[90] Grant's penchant for conveying his characters' feelings with mannerisms, rather than direct emotions, has been one of the foremost objections raised against his acting style. Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post once stated that, to be effective as a comic performer, he must get "his jiving and shucking under control."[91] Film historian David Thomson wrote in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film about how it is merely "itchy mannerisms" that Grant equates with screen acting.[92]
Nonetheless, Grant has shown versatility in some of his more low-profile efforts. He received nearly unanimous critical acclaim as a sleazy, snide community theatre director with a penchant for adolescent boys in the drama film An Awfully Big Adventure and for "a very quiet, dignified" performance as Frédéric Chopin in James Lapine's biopic film Impromptu.[93][94]
Grant's screen persona of later films, in the new millennium, gradually developed into a cynical, self-loathing cad.[95] Claudia Puig of USA Today celebrated this transformation with the observation that finally "gone [were] the self-conscious 'Aren't I adorable' mannerisms that seemed endearing at the start of [Grant's] film career but have grown cloying in more recent movies."[96] Using his facial contortions and an affected stammer for varied comic purposes,[97] According to Carina Chocano, amongst film critics, the two tropes most commonly associated with Grant are that he reinvented his screen persona in Bridget Jones's Diary and About a Boy and dreads the possibility of becoming a parody of himself.[98]
His preference for levity over dramatic range has been a controversial topic in establishment circles, prompting him to say:
I've never been tempted to do the part where I cry or get AIDS or save some people from a concentration camp just to get good reviews. I genuinely believe that comedy acting, light comedy acting, is as hard as, if not harder than serious acting, and it genuinely doesn’t bother me that all the prizes and the good reviews automatically by knee-jerk reaction go to the deepest, darkest, most serious performances and parts. It makes me laugh.[82]
However, in 2012, Grant played several non-comedic cameo roles in the epic drama film Cloud Atlas, an experience he has spoken about positively. He plays six characters in the film, all of which he said are "incredibly evil". Of his decision to appear in the film and of how difficult it was for him to play one of the more violent characters in the movie, he said:
I do a lot of killing and raping [in the film]... But it was a laugh. I thought before I read it that I'd turn it down, which I normally do, but I was interested in meeting [Cloud Atlas co-directors] the Wachowskis because I have always admired them enormously. And they are so charming and fascinating.... I slightly called my own bluff. In one of the parts I am a cannibal, about 2,000 years in the future, and I thought, "I can do that. It's easy." And then I am suddenly standing in a cannibal skirt on a mountaintop in Germany and they are saying, "You know, hungry! We must have that flesh-eating, like a leopard who is so hungry," and I am thinking, "I can't do that! Just give me a witty line!"[99]
Grant has repeatedly spoken about his boredom with playing the celebrity in the press[100] and is known in popular media for his guarded privacy.[101] About the culture of celebrity, he told Vogue, "My theory is that it's like bodybuilders who inject testosterone, which means that their own powers to generate testosterone shut down forever. The fake esteem you get from being in the public eye feels like self-worth, but actually your own powers to produce it shut down. The stuff that really counts is your own. And that's, I think, why people go bonkers."[10] On probing of his personal life, he has remained incredibly steadfast in "offering a dead bat to any question he feels is not general enough."[102] Meanwhile, acquaintances portray him as a complicated man with an anarchic and sharp constitution.[10][38] "There is at least as much of Hugh that is charismatic, intellectual, and whose tongue," according to Mike Newell, "is maybe too clever for its own good as there is of him that's gorgeous and kind of woolly and flubsy."[103] Filmmaker Paul Weitz, calling Grant funny, observed that "he perceives flaws in himself and other people, and then he cares about their humanity nonetheless."[104] British newspapers regularly refer to him as grumpy.[105]
In 1996, Grant won substantial damages from News (UK) Ltd over what his lawyers called a "highly defamatory" article published in January 1995. The company's now-defunct newspaper, Today, had falsely claimed that Grant verbally abused a young extra with a "foul-mouthed tongue lashing" on the set of The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain.[106]
On 27 April 2007, Grant accepted undisclosed damages from the Associated Newspapers over claims made about his relationships with his former girlfriends in three separate tabloid articles, which were published in the Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday on 18, 21 and 24 February. His lawyer stated that all of the articles' "allegations and factual assertions are false."[107] Grant said, in a written statement, that he took the action because: "I was tired of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday papers publishing almost entirely fictional articles about my private life for their own financial gain." He went on to take the opportunity to stress, "I'm also hoping that this statement in court might remind people that the so-called 'close friends' or 'close sources' on which these stories claim to be based almost never exist."[108]
On 27 June 1995, Grant was arrested in a Los Angeles, California, police vice operation not far from Sunset Boulevard for misdemeanour lewd conduct in a public place with Hollywood prostitute Divine Brown.[109] He pleaded no contest and was fined $1,180, placed on two years' summary probation, and was ordered to complete an AIDS education program by Robert J. Sandoval.[110][111]
The arrest occurred about two weeks before the release of Grant's first major studio film, Nine Months, which he was scheduled to promote on several American television shows. The Tonight Show with Jay Leno had him booked for the same week.[112] In the much-watched interview, Grant was noted for not making excuses for the incident after Leno asked him, "What the hell were you thinking?"[113][114] Grant answered, "I think you know in life what's a good thing to do and what's a bad thing, and I did a bad thing. And there you have it."[115]
On Larry King Live, Grant declined host Larry King's repeated invitations to probe his psyche, saying that psychoanalysis was "more of an American syndrome" and he himself was "a bit old fashioned."[116] He told the host: "I don't have excuses."[117] Grant was appreciated for "his refreshing honesty" as he "faced the music and handled it with tongue [in] cheek."[118]
In April 2007, Grant was arrested on allegations of assault made by paparazzo Ian Whittaker.[119] Grant made no official statement and did not comment on the incident.[120] Charges were dropped on 1 June by the Crown Prosecution Service on the grounds of "insufficient evidence."[121]
In April 2011 Grant published an article in the New Statesman entitled "The Bugger, Bugged"[122] about a conversation (following an earlier encounter) with Paul McMullan, former journalist and paparazzo for News of the World. In unguarded comments which were secretly taped by Grant, McMullan alleged that editors at the Daily Mail and News of the World, particularly Andy Coulson, had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior British politicians. McMullan also said that every British Prime Minister from Margaret Thatcher onwards had cultivated a close relationship with Rupert Murdoch and his senior executives. He stressed the friendship between David Cameron and Rebekah Brooks (née Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest: "Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election ... So that was my submission to parliament – that Cameron's either a liar or an idiot."[122]
When asked by Grant whether Cameron had encouraged the Metropolitan Police to "drag their feet" on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch's journalists, McMullan agreed this had happened, and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists: "20 per cent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. So why would they want to open up that can of worms?... And what's wrong with that, anyway? It doesn't hurt anyone particularly."[122]
Grant's article attracted considerable interest, due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation, and the novelty of Grant himself "turning the tables" on a tabloid journalist.[123]
Whilst the allegations regarding the News of the World continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared for example on BBC Radio 4) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered Millie Dowler had been hacked, and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage. Grant became something of a spokesman against Murdoch's News Corporation, culminating in a bravura performance on BBC television's Question Time in July 2011.[124]
Grant said, "It's been fascinating to have a little excursion into another world. I really needed that and also to be dealing with real life instead of creating synthetic life, which is what I've been doing for the last 25 years."[125]
In 1987, while playing Lord Byron in a Spanish production called Remando Al Viento (1988), Grant met actress Elizabeth Hurley, who was cast in a supporting role as Byron's former lover Claire Clairmont.[40] Grant started dating the aspiring model while shooting and their relationship was subsequently the subject of much media attention. After 13 years together, Grant and Hurley made "a mutual and amicable decision" to split in May 2000.[126] Grant is godfather to Hurley's son Damian, born in 2002.[127]
He subsequently began dating Jemima Khan under the intense scrutiny of British tabloids.[10] Three years later, in February 2007, Grant's publicist announced that the couple had "decided to split amicably".[128]
In November 2011, it was announced that Grant had become a father to a baby girl, Tabitha, earlier that autumn.[129] The identity of the mother, with whom Grant had a "fleeting affair" according to his publicist, was not at first announced; however, it was later revealed to be a Chinese woman, Tinglan Hong.[130] In an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in April 2012, Grant revealed that his daughter's Chinese name is Xiao Xi, meaning "happy surprise".[131] Grant and Hong reportedly briefly reunited in 2012. In February 2013, Grant announced that they had recently welcomed a son named Felix Chang.[132][133]
Grant has claimed that Hong has been "badly treated" by the media, saying that press intrusion prevented him from attending the birth of his daughter in September 2011. Grant said, "I was at one of the party conferences, about to give a speech, and was pacing about on the end of the phone. I shouldn’t have gone to the hospital at all, because it brought all this attention down on the mother's head. But I couldn't really resist it, so I went on the second day". Hong later obtained an injunction which allowed Hugh Grant to visit her and baby Tabitha in peace.[129]
In January 2014, conflicting reports revealed Hugh Grant fathered a child with Swedish television producer Anna Elisabet Eberstein in either September 2012[134] or September 2013.[135]
As a young boy, he played rugby union on his school's first XV team at centre and played football as an avid fan of Fulham F.C.. He continued to play in a Sunday-morning football league in south-west London after college and remains an "impassioned Fulham supporter."[28] Grant's other interests include tennis[136] and snooker.[137]
In 2011, the BBC apologised after Grant made an offhand joke about homosexuality and rugby when he was invited into the commentary box during coverage of an England V Scotland game at Twickenham Stadium. Talking about playing rugby during his school days, Grant said: "I discovered it hurt less if you tackled hard than if you tackled like a queen."[138]
Grant is a Patron of The DIPEx Charity,[139] founded by Ann McPherson, a charity that publishes the websites Healthtalkonline and Youthhealthtalk; and a Patron of the Fynvola Foundation, named after his late mother, a charity which provides nursing and care for older learning-disabled people.[140] He is also a supporter of Marie Curie Cancer Care, whose Great Daffodil Appeal he promoted in March 2008.[141]
Grant is patron of Pancreatic Cancer Action, a charity focussed on raising awareness of the disease that killed his mother.[142]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Hugh Grant, one of Britain's best known faces who has been equally entertaining on-screen as well as in real life, and had enough sense of humor to survive a media frenzy, is best known for his roles in Notting Hill (1999), opposite Julia Roberts, and in Music and Lyrics (2007), opposite Drew Barrymore, among his other works.He was born Hugh John Mungo Grant on September 9, 1960, in Hammersmith, London, United Kingdom. His mother, Fyvola Susan (MacLean), was a teacher. His father, James Murray Grant, was an artist and carpet salesman, and his grandfather was in the British Army during WWII. His ancestry is mainly Scottish and English, with distant Irish, Welsh, and Dutch, roots. Young Grant was fond of literature and acting. He won a scholarship to Oxford, going up to New College in 1979. There he was involved in student drama, and considered a career as an art historian. After Oxford, he turned down a scholarship to do postgraduate studies in Art History at the Courtauld Institute in London, and focused on his acting career. In 1982, while still a student, Grant made his big screen debut in Privileged (1982) by director Michael Hoffman.Grant's breakthrough came with the leading role as Charles in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), opposite Andie MacDowell, a role which won him a Golden Globe Award, as well as a BAFTA Film Award for Best Actor. During the 1990s Grant established himself as a very original and resourceful actor. He played a string of characters projecting a positive mindset, showing how do you stay optimistic when you are actually worried about a cascade of troubles. Grant had his own experience as a survivor of an unfortunate episode in his private life, which he managed to overcome thanks to having a pretty damn good outlook on life.His forte is playing characters projecting warmth and sincere happiness, with his hallmark stuttering, albeit some accused him of reprising the same character he has been playing for the past two decades. Grant's ability to show his character development within a limited screen time shines in Love Actually (2003), with his witty portrayal of a Prime Minister whose personal insecurities become intertwined with his country's international affairs, a performance that earned him a nomination for European Audience Award. His screen presence and skillful understatement takes his characters beyond the written script, thanks to his mastery of timing and effortless style.Outside of his acting profession, Grant has been a good athlete, he played cricket and football in his younger years. He enjoys playing golf, frequently taking part in Pro-Am tournaments. He has been an avid art lover since his younger years, and has been collecting fine art, a passion he inherited from his father.
      His production company is called "Simian Films" -- so named by Elizabeth Hurley because she has said that he resembles an ape or a monkey.
      He was arrested in Los Angeles, California, for lewd conduct after police checking into a "suspicious parked car" found him with Divine Brown, a prostitute, in the front seat (it was his car). He pleaded no contest and got a $1,180 fine and two years' probation.
      Opted not to do a nude scene in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) when a make up artist asked if he wanted definition painted on his body.
      On the set of Mickey Blue Eyes (1999), James Caan gave Hugh the nickname of Whippy, because Caan said he worried about everything like "the little whippet dogs that get nervous and you got to put a sweater on them when they're cold".
      Featured in the 1996 paperback "Mug Shots" that includes many other celebrities who've been arrested for one reason or another.
Jay Leno told the London Independent that there are only 18 celebrities worth having on a chat show, one of them being Hugh Grant.
      Has long wanted to make a film about his grandfather's real life escape from a prisoner of war camp during WWII.
      Long time loyal fan of Fulham Football Club (English Premier League soccer club), based at Craven Cottage, Fulham, London, England. Fellow fans include Elizabeth Hurley, Lily Allen, Pierce Brosnan, Hugh Laurie, Benicio Del Toro, Daniel Radcliffe, Andrew Johnston and the late Michael Jackson.
      He is a second cousin, once removed, of Thomas Brodie-Sangster. Hugh's maternal grandmother, Margaret Isabel Randolph, was the sister of one of Thomas's maternal great-grandmothers, Barbara May Randolph.
      Turned down a place to do post-graduate studies in art history at the Courtauld Institute, in order to concentrate on his acting career.
      Had a skating accident when he was a teenager. Part of the bone in his elbow is still detached from the other bones and "swims" freely between the skin and his elbow.
      Played Emma Thompson's love interest in Sense and Sensibility (1995) and her brother in Love Actually (2003). He also collaborated with her in the films Impromptu (1991) and The Remains of the Day (1993).
      Was originally cast as Gilderoy Lockhart in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), but was forced to withdraw at the last moment because of scheduling conflicts.
      In 2001, he purchased an Andy Warhol painting of Elizabeth Taylor for just under $4 million. He later sold it in 2007 for $23.5 million.
      In a 2002 Capital FM radio interview, he stated that The Remains of the Day (1993) is the best and Night Train to Venice (1996) is the worst film he had ever made.
      Often described as a "golfing addict". He also can play cricket, soccer, tennis and snooker. He has stated that his favorite sport to watch is ladies' tennis.
      In 2010, film critic David Thomson wrote in "The New Biographical Dictionary of Film": "With his drooping chin and pouty lips, his quaff of hair and dithery manner, Hugh Grant seems like a refugee from Thirties theatre - or an incipient sneeze looking for a vacant nose".
      Appeared on the cover of GQ magazine three times: December '94, October '98 and November '02 (with Denzel Washington and Ralph Lauren).
      Became a father for the 1st time at age 51 when his ex-girlfriend Tinglan Hong gave birth to their daughter Tabitha Grant on 26 September 2011.
      Became a father for the 2nd time at age 52 when his ex-girlfriend Tinglan Hong gave birth to their son Felix Chang Grant on 16 February 2013.
      His ancestry is English and Scottish, along with distant Irish, Welsh, Cornish, and Dutch roots, and remote French and Belgian (Walloon), ancestry.
      I could do with more mobbing, particularly from women. I'd like to be treated like Ricky Martin.
      I just don't believe in love at first sight any more, even though I've based my whole career on the concept. In my experience, power, money and influence always attract the opposite sex. It's something that I've always exploited - with good results.
      [on being called "posh" by the media] I do, kind of, want to ram their microphones down their patronizing throats.
      I don't particularly like babies. I don't mind them for about four minutes. That's my max. After that I can't quite see what everyone's fussing about.
      I watch an awful lot of women's sport recently. I don't know what that means about me. I watch the women's golf. I watch the women's tennis very much.
      I've got four houses in my street. I live in two and the others are empty. I'll buy more as they come up, because I think it would be great to have the entire street.
      [his thoughts of actress Julia Roberts] Very big-mouthed! Literally, physically, she has a very big mouth. It is a very big mouth. When I was kissing her I was aware of a faint echo.
      [on his screen fight with Colin Firth in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (2004)] It was the same approach as the first one, which was just to make sure that it was as crap as we wanted it to be. The key is to stop the stunt coordinator from coming in to make it look like a film fight. We just wanted it to be two pathetic Englishmen scared of each other, throwing their handbags at each other, basically.
      I think film acting's just a miserable experience. It's so long and so boring and so difficult to get right so that what you need above all is incredible willpower and strength of mind.
      [on playing "the bad guy" in films] Now, I quite like it. For years I sat in these interviews and everyone said, "You're always Mister Nice Guy, why don't you ever play someone nasty?" So in fact it's been a relief to be . . . for the real me to come out more on camera. I don't have any particular burning desire to go back to being cuddly. Not really.
      [on why he is conducting a crusade to regulate standards for the British press] It certainly isn't a craving for attention. I trudge on to 'Newsnight' or 'Question Time', like Saddam to the scaffold. We beg them to use our professors, but they won't.
      I'm often asked why I keep banging on about the press. Am I a lefty? I'm not. I'm not a righty either. I drift.
=======================================================
You wouldn't think it to look at him, and certainly not to listen to him, but Hugh Grant has turned out to be something of a survivor. Having spent years in the acting doldrums, unsure even as to whether he had chosen an appropriate, "dignified" career, he scored a massive smash with Four Weddings And A Funeral. Then, just as suddenly, it all collapsed around him, in a whirl of failed productions and very public sex scandals. And yet he rose again, alongside Julia Roberts in Notting Hill, and this time he didn't look back. He received the accolade of a part in a Woody Allen film, he starred with Rene Zellweger in the international hit Bridget Jones' Diary, and then came About A Boy, another adaptation of a bestselling paperback, this time by everyone's favourite Nice Bloke, Nick Hornby.Hugh Grant, blessed with the middle names John and Mungo, was born in London on September 9th, 1960. His father, James, was an artist who made money running a carpet firm, while his mother was a teacher (his older brother, also named James, is now a banker). Both his parents were from military backgrounds. One grandfather was in the Seaforth Highlanders - Grant would like to make a movie of his WW2 heroics, but his father forbids it, believing all movies to be a "vulgarisation" of the truth. Growing up in suburbia, Grant won a scholarship to Oxford, going up to New College in 1979. Though considering a career as an art historian, here he tried his hand at student drama, at one point featuring in Hamlet - performed in Star Trek costumes. Before this, his efforts onstage had only served to bring about his greatest humiliation. During a school play, he was called upon to sing If They Could See Me Now, but came in way out-of-key, having to stop and start again. He still recalls the laughing, and the pointing. Nowadays, having since appeared in such weighty productions as An Inspector Calls, Lady Windermere's Fan and Coriolanus, Grant considers himself a more effective actor onstage than onscreen. But cinema grabbed him early, and he appeared in Michael Hoffman's Privileged while still in college in 1982, credited as Hughie Grant.On leaving, he was painfully unsure of what to do next. He tells a story of attempted teaching where he agreed to tutor a young girl between schools. After she refused to answer any of his questions, he lost patience with her, only to discover that, mortifyingly, she was deaf in one ear and could not hear him. Having tried out comedy at Oxford, and taken to it (he freely describes himself as a "Laugh Tart"), he joined a comedy review called the Jockeys Of Norfolk. They played the London pub comedy circuit, including the George IV in Chiswick, often appearing on the same bill as Mike Myers, then resident in London. For extra money, they would write sketches for comedy shows and pen radio ads. Later, Grant would also turn his hand to book-reviewing, and to his still-incomplete novel (working title Slack) about - because you have to tell it like you see it - a man with no job.. The Jockeys Of Norfolk nearly made it. Invited to play the Edinburgh Festival, they were booked into a 2000-seater theatre which, on the first night, saw 6 people pay to enter. Fortuitously, the group scored a slot on Russell Harty's TV show and, BANG, there were queues round the block. The Jockeys were contracted to make a pilot for a TV series but, their show being more suited to theatre than TV, it didn't work. Disillusioned - Grant claims they were actually more disinterested - they split up.Grant continued (rather lethargically) to pursue a movie career. A big break, and his first paid acting job, came almost immediately when he was cast in 1984's The Bounty, the Mel Gibson remake of Mutiny On the Bounty. All set for a few weeks filming in Tahiti, Grant was sacked on the day of departure for having no Union card. The next two years were spent on TV appearances of questionable worth, one exception being The Last Place On Earth, a powerful drama concerning Scott and Amundsen's race to the South Pole, starring Martin Shaw and Max Von Sydow. But it was all good experience for what came next, as Grant was signed by Merchant-Ivory to co-star as Clive Durham in 1987's Maurice, a moving tale involving college-based homosexual scandal. The film also starred James Wilby, who'd appeared with Grant in Privileged. Such were their performances, the pair would tie for the Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival.Next came another stiff-upper-lipped period sex drama in White Mischief. Then Carlos Suarez's Rowing With The Wind, a behind-the-scenes look at the writing of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, wherein Grant played Lord Byron and - making her debut as Claire, Shelley's half-sister and Byron's former lover - Elizabeth Hurley also appeared. She was already Grant's girlfriend and would remain so for the next 13 years. Now Grant played Chopin in Francois Aubry's short Nocturnes, joined John Hurt in La Nuit Bengali, and hugely enjoyed a return to gothic horror in Ken Russell's lunatic adaptation of Bram Stoker's The Lair Of The White Worm. But these were not hit movies and Grant found his career on the slide. Aside from 1990's Impromptu, where once again he was Chopin, this time pursued by a mannish and predatory Judy Davis, his time was spent in fairly horrific TV movies. He played a champagne baron in Champagne Charlie and, bizarrely, another champagne baron in Till We Meet Again - only this time he was the villainous Bruno, who rapes Courtney Cox and hands all the family fizz over to the Nazis. Then there was Our Sons, with Julie Andrews and Ann-Margret. It really wasn't looking good.Amazingly, as you'd expect him to fold like a wet leaf of lettuce, Grant stuck in there. He appeared in the gritty Liam Neeson-starring streetfighting drama The Big Man, then as the wholly ineffectual husband of Kristen Scott Thomas, freaked out by the sexually predatory Peter Coyote and Emmanuelle Seigner in Roman Polanski's Bitter Moon. The same year (1992), he went up for a part in a mooted version of Shakespeare In Love, to star Julia Roberts, then red-hot after Pretty Woman. He was so nervous she told him to go home and try again a few days later. He didn't get the part. Then again, neither did she, as the project fell through - only to be resurrected in 1998 with Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes as the leads.. Many might find Grant's performance in Bitter Moon to be irritating, so wimpy, so innately hopeless is his character. But this has, in fact, turned out to be his greatest strength, a character he plays brilliantly for comic purposes. It certainly helped him now, as his showing in that movie won him the part in Richard Curtis's Four Weddings And A Funeral, as the mumbling, shambling, yet profoundly charming toff who (kind of) chases after Andie MacDowell. The film made $320 million, making it the highest grossing British film ever, and Grant won both a BAFTA and a Golden Globe. Now he was a star, placing himself in classy productions like Sirens, Restoration (once more with Michael Hoffman, who'd next direct One Fine Day) and Emma Thompson's Ang Lee-directed Sense And Sensibility (he'd appeared with her two years earlier in the heartbreaking Remains Of The Day). He made advances to Hollywood, starring with Julianne Moore in Nine Months. In the meantime, Simian, the production company he'd set up with Hurley (the company was so named because she thought he looked like a monkey), was putting together Extreme Measures, where Grant took his first action role, beefing it up beside Gene Hackman. What could go wrong?Well, who would have guessed? On June 27th, 1995, Grant was arrested by the LAPD "on suspicion of lewd conduct in a public place", having been caught in his car on Sunset Strip with prostitute Divine Brown (formerly Stella Marie Thompson), whom he'd apparently paid $50 to perform a service down below - as it were. He received a '1180 fine and two years probation. His relationship with Hurley was in jeopardy, his police mug-shot in every paper in the world. His explanation that he was exhausted by the publicizing of Nine Months (12 interviews that very day) and didn't know what he was doing was not taken seriously. His stardom looked to be all over, almost as soon as it had begun.Yet somehow it did not taint him in the eyes of many. Suddenly appearing more manly to the young male demographic, he found orders of his videos went up 30%. Appearing on the Jay Leno show, with Leno opening the interview with a loud "What the hell were you thinking?", Grant replied with a mumbled "I'm not one to go around blowing my own trumpet" and sent the audience into raptures. Indeed, that show scored Leno's third highest ever rating, and put him ahead of arch-rival David Letterman for the very first time. More painful was the fate of Extreme Measures, which bombed badly. While Hurley went stellar in Mike Myers' Austin Powers, and appeared everywhere as the face of Estee Lauder, Grant all but disappeared. Then he was back, in Notting Hill where he finally starred, as bookshop owner William Thacker, alongside Julia Roberts in the "sequel" to his biggest hit. Once more on his own turf - light comedy - he was once more described as "a Cary Grant for the Nineties", and nominated for a Golden Globe. Bravely, he took on the Mob-comedy Mickey Blue Eyes (again produced by Simian), engaging in a hilarious war with co-star James Caan in subsequent interviews. He found a hundred different ways to call Caan old and stupid, while Caan revealed that he nicknamed Grant "Whippy" because of "the little whippet dogs that get nervous and you got to put a sweater on them when they're cold".Next, he was a snobby art-dealer and Tracey Ullman's love interest in Small Time Crooks. Then came another huge hit with Bridget Jones's Diary, where he played the unspeakable cad Daniel Cleaver, Rene Zellweger's boss and sometime lover, who cheats on her, leaves her hanging on and engages in a hilariously foppish fight with good-guy Colin Firth. The cast quickly signed on for Bridget 2, based on Helen Fielding's Edge Of Reason, but altered to allow the beastly Cleaver to reappear. After Bridget 1, Hugh suffered the loss of his mother, then took on About A Boy, directed by American Pie duo Paul and Chris Weitz. Here he played Will Freeman, a 38-year-old who, due to inherited wealth, has never worked and never taken on any responsibilities. With all his friends now married and unable to join in his shenanigans, he pretends to be a single father and tries to meet single mothers who, he figures, he can easily leave should they demand commitment. But he takes a shine to Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), 12-year-old son of suicidal hippy Toni Collette, and then falls for beautiful illustrator Rachel Weisz. What to do? What to do? As he tries to teach unhappy Marcus how to be cool, Marcus teaches him how to grow up. The movie was a big hit, with Hugh widening his range with a scruffy hairdo and North London accent, and portraying a selfish streak even more impressively than he had done in Bridget Jones's Diary.Having played yet another cad when providing the voice of Blitzen, Robbie The Reindeer's arch enemy in the US version of The Legend Of The Lost Tribe (reprising the role he'd played in 1999's Hooves Of Fire), he moved on to another big American rom-com, Two Weeks Notice (a movie annoyingly lacking an apostrophe). Here he played a Donald Trump type, making millions by "modernizing" New York communities - that is, pulling all the beautiful old buildings down. On his case is liberal activist Sandra Bullock who he now hires as his attorney. But she soon tires of her role as his all-round gofer, only to suffer pangs of jealousy when she sees him being hit on by her hard-nosed replacement Alicia Witt. Could these disparate characters possibly fall in love? Well, Americans spent $93 million at the box office to find out - Grant was still big news.. As ever in Grant's career, Richard Curtis was never far away, and he now showed up again with his directorial debut Love, Actually. This saw many different tales of love interwoven, with Hugh playing a bumbling but strangely efficient British Prime Minister, who falls for tea-girl Martine McCutcheon and follows her into the poorer environs of London to win her heart. Curtis would then show up as script doctor when Grant returned to a previous hit with Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason. This time Bridget has dumped Darcy and Hugh's beastly Daniel Cleaver moves in for the kill, once again getting into a hilariously ungainly scrap with his rival. Grant would claim that, with such a long gap between Love, Actually and Bridget 2, he had terrible trouble with his lines and even suffered stagefright.Still close to Elizabeth Hurley, it was he who, at the end of 2001, told police that stalker Petr Mihalovic was sending her abusive letters demanding she abort her baby. But Hugh himself remained single, in 2003 seeing Polish-born UN worker Kasia Komorowicz but not hitting the tabloid headlines until he was spotted in 2004 with Jemima Khan, recently separated from her husband Imran. When not working, he'd either be playing golf with such buddies as Kyle MacLachlan, or be lounging about in his '3 million, 7th-floor flat in Kensington, complete with terrace, barbecue and a rising movie screen at the foot of the bed. Never truly prolific, Grant would appear onscreen in 2005 only in a pop-up cameo at the end of Housewarming, a French comedy where wacky lawyer Carole Bouquet's home is assaulted by illegal immigrant builders. 2006, though, would see an amazing two releases. First would come American Dreamz, a satire of talent shows like American Idol where Dennis Quaid, doing an impression of George W Bush, would play a troubled president persuaded to become a judge on a hit TV programme. Grant would stand out as the self-aggrandizing but self-loathing host, a predator on the look-out for saleable talent, such as Mandy Moore's young singer. Following this would come the much-delayed Music And Lyrics By, written and directed by Marc "Two Weeks Notice" Lawrence, a rom-com that saw Grant working with and, inevitably, falling for Drew Barrymore, whose Flower Films would produce.Hugh Grant, earning $12.5 million for Two Weeks Notice, is now Britain's most successful comic actor, a position he neither understands nor particularly likes. "I've never had a burning desire to get ahead in Hollywood," he told Empire in 2002. "Here I was in this joke job of acting, thinking it'd be a laugh before I did something more serious, and just as I was about to get out, Four Weddings happened." Hugh later stated that he hoped his film stardom would just be "a phase", hopefully lasting no more than ten years.So, Hugh Grant may well be saying farewell to cinema in the very near future. Enjoy him while you can.Dominic Wills

=======================================================
Equally famous and infamous, actor Hugh Grant is compelling whether playing the stuttering romantic lead or the cynical rogue. The BAFTA-award winning English actor was born in Hammersmith, West London, in 1960.
He is the second son of James Murray Grant, the boss of a carpet company and former soldier, and Fynvola, a teacher who died of cancer in 2001. His older brother, also named James, is a banker. Grant was later sent to Wetherby preparatory school and in 1979 won a scholarship to prestigious Oxford university.
Far from his solid middle-class background, Grant joined the exclusive Piers Gaveston Society at Oxford - a group with a reputation for debauchery and decadence. He excelled academically and became involved in student drama. In 1982, while still a student, Grant made his big screen debut in 'Privileged', a film about Oxford undergraduates’ bed-hopping. He is credited under the name Hughie - his childhood moniker.
His 'Privileged' performance caught the eye of talent scouts and he was persuaded to abandon plans for a doctorate in art history. Grant decided not to sign up with the acting agency and instead, set about earning his Equity card as an extra.
Following a few small television roles, Grant got his real first break when he was cast in the Merchant Ivory film 'Maurice', in 1987. There followed a portrayal of Chopin in 'Impromptu' (1991) and the part of a young English cruise passenger in 'Bitter Moon' (1992), directed by Roman Polanski.
He was busy acting during the early 90s but his big breakthrough came in 1994 when he played the stammering, floppy-haired Charles in Richard Curtis’ 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. Though he has played more rakish and crop-haired roles since, the 'Four Weddings’ charming-yet-bumbling character has become the embodiment of Grant.
Playing Andy MacDowell’s love interest, Grant’s irresistible portrayal won him a Golden Globe Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture award, as well as a BAFTA Best Actor award. It was at the London premiere of 'Four Weddings' that Hugh was upstaged by his then partner, English actress and model Elizabeth Hurley.
The couple had met on the set of 'Rowing With The Wind', a behind-the-scenes look at the writing of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Grant played Lord Byron and - making her debut as Claire, Shelley's half-sister and Byron's former lover - Elizabeth Hurley also appeared. However, the night of the 'Four Weddings’ premiere, Liz stole the headlines for wearing a black, plunging Versace dress held together with gold oversize safety pins.
Outside of his acting profession, Grant has been a keen athlete, playing cricket and football in his younger years. He currently loves golf and has been an avid art lover since his younger years, and has been collecting fine art, a passion he inherited from his father. His comic icons include Monty Python and Fawlty Towers, Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks’ films.
Despite Four Weddings' hype and star-promise, Grant then starred in a series of films which barely registered - some spawned from his and Hurley’s production company Simian Films.
Grant’s private life is the topic of just as much, if not more scrutiny than his screen persona. For 14 years, between 1986 and 2000, he dated Hurley but in 1995, he was arrested in Los Angeles on Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard for indecent conduct with prostitute Divine Brown. Considerable damage was done to Grant's public image after his mug shot was beamed around the world. Grant admitted to receiving oral sex from Brown but managed to win back public adoration for his honest televised apologies. He pleaded not guilty and received a $1,180 fine and two years' probation.
In 1999, Grant again enchanted fans and critics with his performance opposite Julia Roberts in another Richard Curtis film, 'Notting Hill', playing a similar role as the foppish, unlucky-then-lucky in love admirer of Roberts’ film star character. He told reporters it felt weird to be kissing a silver-screen icon but later found his usual dry-humoured self. “She is very big-mouthed. Literally, physically, she has a very big mouth. It is a very big mouth. When I was kissing her I was aware of a faint echo.’’
'Mickey Blue Eyes' (1999), the story of an English auctioneer proposing to the daughter of a Mafia kingpin, under-whelmed at the box office but Grant re-emerged with a change of tack.
He played Daniel Cleaver, the type of naughty boy your mother always told you to steer clear of, in international hit 'Bridget Jones's Diary', in 2001. His character was loved and loathed by Bridget Jones but just plain adored by audiences.
Grant has said he feels most affinity with Will in 'About a Boy', based on Nick Hornby's book about a man being forced to grow up after befriending a child. "I have lived so much of my life as a London slacker. I did a lot of the stuff Will does in the movie. I played snooker, I divided my day into half hours. I can tell you everything that is on afternoon TV.’’
Grant's ability to show character development within a limited screen time shines in 'Love Actually' (2003), with his witty portrayal of a Prime Minister whose personal insecurities become intertwined with his country's international affairs.
After categorically proving himself one of Britain’s most bankable exports, Grant teamed up with American actress Sandra Bullock in the romantic comedy 'Two Weeks’ Notice'. Typically self-deprecating, Grant told reporters he had inadvertently delayed their pairing for years. "We had a 'relationship meeting’, where you talk about the possibility of working together. I told Sandy a very disgusting story, which I think revolted her, she left the room, and I didn't hear from her for three years after that.’’
In 2004, the follow-up to Bridget Jones Diary was released - 'Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason' - in which he resurrected the Cleaver performance and had one of the funniest on-screen, non-macho fist fights with fellow British actor Colin Firth. Grant made Cleaver’s first film appearance so memorable and popular that his part was extended specifically for the second Bridget film.
Also in 2004, Grant began dating socialite and Unicef ambassador Jemima Khan, ex-wife of Imran Khan, their relationship going public after months of denial.
In 'American Dreamz' (2006), Grant played the slimy Simon Cowell-a-like character of Martin Tweed - a judge on an American talent show similar to 'Pop Idol'. The film took pot shots at many satirical targets and Grant’s Tweed finds himself helplessly attracted to a young, female wannabe pop star because she's almost as hollow as he is.
Continuing with his American A-list status, Grant’s latest box office hit was the romantic-comedy 'Music and Lyrics'. Grant stars as aging boy-band loser Alex Fletcher opposite Drew Barrymore. Even though Grant has historically claimed he could not sing, at the age of 46 the actor has turned crooner, appearing on several of the film’s songs, including its catchy title soundtrack, 'Pop Goes My Heart'.
The eternal bachelor, just a month after announcing he was ready to settle down and marry, Grant and Khan broke up in February 2007. The split was said to be amicable, though tabloids would have the public believe differently. In April, Grant accepted undisclosed libel damages from Associated Newspapers, for three "entirely fictional" stories following their break-up.
That same month he ran foul of the press again after he was arrested but later bailed for an allegedly attacking photographer Ian Whittaker. Wielding the most British of weapons, Grant flung baked beans at the paparazzo. Whittaker alleged Grant had attacked him after he tried to take photographs of his former girlfriend Hurley, who lives nearby. Courts took the incident no further saying there was too little evidence to charge Grant.
More recently, Hugh Grant has made headlines for his involvement in the News International phone hacking scandal.
In April 2011, Grant wrote an article of the New Statesman detailing a conversation he recorded with ex-News of the World journalist Peter McMullan.
The reporter and newspaper had long been a thorn in the side of Hugh Grant's career, providing the star with much unwanted press coverage.
This time round though, the roles were reversed, as Grant's article gained worldwide coverage, with readers even able to download audio of the conversation with McMullan.
Writing about the encounter though, Grant remained his usual foppish self: "Apart from the fact that Paul hates people like me, and I hate people like him, we got on quite well."
The article saw Hugh Grant emerge as an unofficial spokesperson for celebrities embroiled in the phone hacking saga, even appearing as a notable guest on a 2011 edition of the BBC's Question Time programme.
His latest films include 'Did You Hear About The Morgans?' (2009) and the Aardman animations feature 'The Pirates! Band of Misfits' (2012) - he will also appear in the upcoming movie version of 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E'.

A graduate of Oxford, actor Hugh Grant would seem more a natural product of Cambridge University, breeding ground for such comic talents as Monty Python's Flying Circus. Grant's classic good looks make him a shoo-in for romantic leads, but his comic abilities -- marked by a nervous stutter, desperately fluttering eyelids, and an ability to capture a brand of distinctly English embarrassment -- have also marked him as a gifted comic performer. Born in London on September 9, 1960, Grant made his film debut under the very Oxbridge name of Hughie Grant in the Oxford-financed Privileged (1982). He then worked in repertory before forming his own comedy troupe, the Jockeys of Norfolk. Following some television roles, Grant made his first professional film appearance in 1987 with a blink-and-he's-gone part in White Mischief. The same year he did more substantial work, first as Lord Byron in Rowing With the Wind, and then as a sexually conflicted Edwardian in Ismail Merchant and James Ivory's adaptation of E.M. Forster's Maurice. The role won him a Best Actor award at the Venice Film Festival, but despite such acclaim, Grant's next films were largely forgettable affairs.  One exception -- albeit a dubious one -- was Ken Russell's The Lair of the White Worm, in which the actor attained some degree of cult status as a lord attempting to foil the murderous charms of a campy, trampy vampire (Amanda Donahoe).Following period work in Impromptu (in which he played a consumptive, bewigged Chopin) and another Merchant-Ivory outing, The Remains of the Day, Grant finally hit it big in 1994 with starring roles in two films, Sirens and Four Weddings and a Funeral. The latter film in particular gave the actor almost overnight transatlantic stardom, landing him on a number of magazine covers and TV talk shows. The following year, Grant gained fame of an entirely different sort when he was arrested for soliciting the services of an L.A. prostitute. The box-office take of his subsequent film, Nine Months, released on the heels of his arrest, was buoyed by his notoriety, as were the ratings of the episode of The Tonight Show which featured Grant's sheepish apology to his then-girlfriend, model/actress Elizabeth Hurley. The actor managed to recoup some of his professional dignity with a restrained performance as Emma Thompson's suitor in the acclaimed Sense and Sensibility, but his next feature, Extreme Measures, a thriller produced by his and Hurley's production company, Simian Films, proved a disappointment. Following this relative failure, Grant receded somewhat from the public consciousness, but reappeared in 1999 with Notting Hill.  A commercial as well as relative critical success, the comedy helped to restore some of the actor's luster, further assisted by his roles in the comedies Mickey Blue Eyes (1999) and Woody Allen's Small Time Crooks (2000). After once again charming filmgoers while competing for the affections of Rene Zellwegger in Bridget Jones's Diary, Grant took on the role of a playful London lothario who forms a bond with one of his conquests' offspring in the romantic comedy About a Boy. Indeed, the romantic comedy seemed to be simply the most natural fit for the actor, and he found more success in new millennium with returns to this genre in Two Weeks Notice, Love Actually, and the sequel to Bridget Jones's Diary, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. He played a fictionalized version of {$Simon Cowell] in the comedy American Dreamz, and was solid as a washed-up 80's pop star opposite Drew Barrymore in the romantic comedy Music and Lyrics in 2007. He made headlines when he figured into the phone hacking scandal in the UK, becoming one of the most high-profile celebrities to explain how the British tabloids have been operating for years. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi
