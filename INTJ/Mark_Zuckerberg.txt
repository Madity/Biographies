Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (born May 14, 1984) is an American computer programmer, Internet entrepreneur, and philanthropist.[6] He is best known as one of five co-founders of the social networking website Facebook. As of April 2013, Zuckerberg is the chairman and chief executive of Facebook, Inc.[7][8] and his personal wealth, as of April 2014, is estimated to be $25.3 billion.[5] Mark Zuckerberg receives a one-dollar salary as CEO of Facebook.[4]
Together with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, Zuckerberg launched Facebook from Harvard's dormitory rooms.[9] The group then introduced Facebook onto other campuses nationwide and moved to Palo Alto, California shortly afterwards. In 2007, at the age of 23, Zuckerberg became a billionaire as a result of Facebook's success. The number of Facebook users worldwide reached a total of one billion in 2012. Zuckerberg was involved in various legal disputes that were initiated by others in the group, who claimed a share of the company based upon their involvement during the development phase of Facebook.
Since 2010, Time magazine has named Zuckerberg among the 100 wealthiest and most influential people in the world as a part of its Person of the Year distinction.[10][11][12] In 2011, Zuckerberg ranked first on the list of the "Most Influential Jews in the World" by The Jerusalem Post and has since consistently topped the list every year as of 2013.[13][14] Zuckerberg was played by actor Jesse Eisenberg in the 2010 film The Social Network, in which the rise of Facebook is portrayed.[15]
Zuckerberg was born in 1984 in White Plains, New York.[16] He is the son of dentist Edward Zuckerberg and psychiatrist Karen Kempner.[17] He and his three sisters, Randi, Donna, and Arielle,[2] were brought up in Dobbs Ferry, New York, a small town about 10 miles north of New York City.[2] Zuckerberg was raised Jewish and had his bar mitzvah when he turned 13.[18] Afterwards, he became an atheist.[19][20][21]
At Ardsley High School, Zuckerberg excelled in classics. He transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy in his junior year, where he won prizes in science (math, astronomy and physics) and classical studies. On his college application, Zuckerberg claimed that he could read and write French, Hebrew, Latin, and ancient Greek. He was captain of the fencing team.[20][22][23][24] In college, he was known for reciting lines from epic poems such as The Iliad.[22]
Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. His father taught him Atari BASIC Programming in the 1990s, and later hired software developer David Newman to tutor him privately. Newman calls him a "prodigy", adding that it was "tough to stay ahead of him". Zuckerberg took a graduate course in the subject at Mercy College near his home while still in high school. He enjoyed developing computer programs, especially communication tools and games. In one such program, since his father's dental practice was operated from their home, he built a software program he called "ZuckNet" that allowed all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other. It is considered a "primitive" version of AOL's Instant Messenger, which came out the following year.
According to writer Jose Antonio Vargas, "some kids played computer games. Mark created them." Zuckerberg himself recalls this period: "I had a bunch of friends who were artists. They'd come over, draw stuff, and I'd build a game out of it." However, notes Vargas, Zuckerberg was not a typical "geek-klutz", as he later became captain of his prep school fencing team and earned a classics diploma. Napster co-founder Sean Parker, a close friend, notes that Zuckerberg was "really into Greek odysseys and all that stuff", recalling how he once quoted lines from the Roman epic poem Aeneid, by Virgil, during a Facebook product conference.[2]
During Zuckerberg's high school years, under the company name Intelligent Media Group, he built a music player called the Synapse Media Player that used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to Slashdot[25] and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine.[26]
By the time he began classes at Harvard, Zuckerberg had already achieved a "reputation as a programming prodigy", notes Vargas. He studied psychology and computer science as well as belonging to Alpha Epsilon Pi, a Jewish fraternity, and Kirkland House.[2][10][27] In his sophomore year, he wrote a program he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups. A short time later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best looking person from a choice of photos. According to Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, Arie Hasit, "he built the site for fun". Hasit explains:
We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures, or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was "hotter" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.[28]
The site went up over a weekend; but by Monday morning, the college shut it down because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's network switches and prevented students from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was "completely improper."[28]
The following semester, in January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website.[29] On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "Thefacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com.[30]
Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com, while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.[31] The three complained to the Harvard Crimson and the newspaper began an investigation in response.
Following the official launch of the Facebook social media platform, the three filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement.[32] The agreed settlement was for 1.2 million Facebook shares that were worth US$300 million at Facebook's IPO.[33]
Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in his sophomore year to complete his project.[34] In January 2014, Zuckerberg recalled:
I remember really vividly, you know, having pizza with my friends a day or two after—I opened up the first version of Facebook at the time I thought, "You know, someone needs to build a service like this for the world." But I just never thought that we'd be the ones to help do it. And I think a lot of what it comes down to is we just cared more.[35]

Zuckerberg launched Facebook from his Harvard dormitory room on February 4, 2004.[36][37] An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student directory, “The Photo Address Book,” which students referred to as “The Facebook.” Such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.[36]
Once at college, Zuckerberg's Facebook started off as just a "Harvard thing" until Zuckerberg decided to spread it to other schools, enlisting the help of roommate Dustin Moskovitz. They began with Columbia, New York University, Stanford, Dartmouth, Cornell, Penn, Brown, and Yale.[38] Samyr Laine, a triple jumper representing Haiti at the 2012 Summer Olympics, shared a room with Zuckerberg during Facebook's founding. "Mark was clearly on to great things," said Laine, who was Facebook's fourteenth user.[39]
After Zuckerberg moved to Palo Alto, California with Moskovitz and some friends, they leased a small house that served as an office. Over the summer, Zuckerberg met Peter Thiel who invested in the company. They got their first office in mid-2004. According to Zuckerberg, the group planned to return to Harvard but eventually decided to remain in California.[40][41] They had already turned down offers by major corporations to buy the company. In an interview in 2007, Zuckerberg explained his reasoning: "It's not because of the amount of money. For me and my colleagues, the most important thing is that we create an open information flow for people. Having media corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to me."[37]
He restated these goals to Wired magazine in 2010: "The thing I really care about is the mission, making the world open."[42] Earlier, in April 2009, Zuckerberg sought the advice of former Netscape CFO Peter Currie about financing strategies for Facebook.[43] On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg reported that the company reached the 500 million-user mark.[44] When asked whether Facebook could earn more income from advertising as a result of its phenomenal growth, he explained:
I guess we could..... If you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query. The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with ads..... That's the simplest thing we could do. But we aren't like that. We make enough money. Right, I mean, we are keeping things running; we are growing at the rate we want to.[42]
In 2010, Steven Levy, who wrote the 1984 book Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, wrote that Zuckerberg "clearly thinks of himself as a hacker". Zuckerberg said that "it's OK to break things" "to make them better".[45][46] Facebook instituted "hackathons" held every six to eight weeks where participants would have one night to conceive of and complete a project.[45] The company provided music, food, and beer at the hackathons, and many Facebook staff members, including Zuckerberg, regularly attended.[46] "The idea is that you can build something really good in a night", Zuckerberg told Levy. "And that's part of the personality of Facebook now..... It's definitely very core to my personality."[45]
Vanity Fair magazine named Zuckerberg number 1 on its 2010 list of the Top 100 "most influential people of the Information Age".[47] Zuckerberg ranked number 23 on the Vanity Fair 100 list in 2009.[48] In 2010, Zuckerberg was chosen as number 16 in New Statesman's annual survey of the world's 50 most influential figures.[49]
In a 2011 interview with PBS after the death of Steve Jobs, Zuckerberg said that Jobs had advised him on how to create a management team at Facebook that was "focused on building as high quality and good things as you are".[50]
On October 1, 2012, Zuckerberg visited Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow to stimulate social media innovation in Russia and to boost Facebook's position in the Russian market.[51] Russia's communications minister tweeted that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev urged the social media giant's founder to abandon plans to lure away Russian programmers and instead consider opening a research center in Moscow. In 2012, Facebook had roughly 9 million users in Russia, while domestic clone VK had around 34 million.[52] Rebecca Van Dyck, Facebook's head of consumer marketing, claimed that 85 million American Facebook users were exposed to the first day of the Home promotional campaign on April 6, 2013.[53]
On August 19, 2013, the Washington Post reported that Zuckerberg's Facebook profile was hacked by an unemployed web developer.[54]
At the 2013 TechCrunch Disrupt conference, held in September, Zuckerberg stated that he is working towards registering the 5 billion humans who were not connected to the Internet as of the conference on Facebook. Zuckerberg then explained that this is intertwined with the aim of the Internet.org project, whereby Facebook, with the support of other technology companies, seeks to increase the number of people connected to the internet.[55][56]
Zuckerberg is the keynote speaker at the 2014 Mobile World Congress (MWC), held in Barcelona, Spain in March, which will be attended by 75,000 delegates. Various media sources highlighted the connection between Facebook's focus on mobile technology and Zuckerberg's speech, claiming that mobile represents the future of the company.[57] Zuckerberg's speech expands upon the goal that he raised at the TechCrunch conference in September 2013, whereby he is working towards expanding Internet coverage into developing countries.[58]
A month after Facebook launched in February 2004, i2hub, another campus-only service, created by Wayne Chang, was launched. i2hub focused on peer-to-peer file sharing. At the time, both i2hub and Facebook were gaining the attention of the press and growing rapidly in users and publicity. In August 2004, Zuckerberg, Andrew McCollum, Adam D'Angelo, and Sean Parker launched a competing peer-to-peer file sharing service called Wirehog, a precursor to Facebook Platform applications.[59][60]
On May 24, 2007, Zuckerberg announced Facebook Platform, a development platform for programmers to create social applications within Facebook. Within weeks, many applications had been built and some already had millions of users. It grew to more than 800,000 developers around the world building applications for Facebook Platform.[citation needed]
On November 6, 2007, Zuckerberg announced Beacon, a social advertising system that enabled people to share information with their Facebook friends based on their browsing activities on other sites. For example, eBay sellers could let friends know automatically what they have for sale via the Facebook news feed as they listed items for sale. The program came under scrutiny because of privacy concerns from groups and individual users. Zuckerberg and Facebook failed to respond to the concerns quickly, and on December 5, 2007, Zuckerberg wrote a blog post on Facebook,[61] taking responsibility for the concerns about Beacon and offering an easier way for users to opt out of the service.
In 2007, Zuckerberg was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[62]
In a public Facebook post, Zuckerberg launched the Internet.org project in late August 2013. Zuckerberg explained that the primary aim of the initiative is to provide Internet access to the 5 billion people who are not connected as of the launch date. Using a three-tier strategy, Internet.org will also create new jobs and open up new markets, according to Zuckerberg. He stated in his post:
The world economy is going through a massive transition right now. The knowledge economy is the future. By bringing everyone online, we'll not only improve billions of lives, but we'll also improve our own as we benefit from the ideas and productivity they contribute to the world. Giving everyone the opportunity to connect is the foundation for enabling the knowledge economy. It is not the only thing we need to do, but it's a fundamental and necessary step.[56]
Harvard students Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of intentionally making them believe he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com (later called ConnectU).[63] They filed a lawsuit in 2004, but it was dismissed on a technicality on March 28, 2007. It was refiled soon thereafter in federal court in Boston. Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly, a project put out by The Winklevoss Chang Group, an alleged partnership between ConnectU and i2hub. On June 25, 2008, the case settled and Facebook agreed to transfer over 1.2 million common shares and pay $20 million in cash.[64]
In November 2007, confidential court documents were posted on the website of 02138, a magazine that catered to Harvard alumni. They included Zuckerberg's social security number, his parents' home address, and his girlfriend's address. Facebook filed to have the documents removed, but the judge ruled in favor of 02138.[65]
A lawsuit filed by Eduardo Saverin against Facebook and Zuckerberg was settled out of court. Though terms of the settlement were sealed, the company affirmed Saverin's title as co-founder of Facebook. Saverin signed a non-disclosure contract after the settlement.[66]
In June 2010, Pakistani Deputy Attorney General Muhammad Azhar Sidiqque launched a criminal investigation into Zuckerberg and Facebook co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes after a "Draw Muhammad" contest was hosted on Facebook. The investigation named the anonymous German woman who created the contest. Sidiqque asked the country's police to contact Interpol to have Zuckerberg and the three others arrested for blasphemy. On May 19, 2010, Facebook's website was temporarily blocked in Pakistan until Facebook removed the contest from its website at the end of May. Sidiqque also asked its UN representative to raise the issue with the United Nations General Assembly.[67][68]
In June 2010, Paul Ceglia, the owner of a wood pellet fuel company in Allegany County, upstate New York, filed suit against Zuckerberg, claiming 84% ownership of Facebook and seeking monetary damages. According to Ceglia, he and Zuckerberg signed a contract on April 28, 2003, that an initial fee of $1,000 entitled Ceglia to 50% of the website's revenue, as well as an additional 1% interest in the business per day after January 1, 2004, until website completion. Zuckerberg was developing other projects at the time, among which was Facemash, the predecessor of Facebook, but did not register the domain name thefacebook.com until January 1, 2004. Facebook management dismissed the lawsuit as "completely frivolous". Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told a reporter that Ceglia's counsel had unsuccessfully sought an out-of-court settlement.[69][70]
On October 26, 2012, federal authorities arrested Ceglia, charging him with mail and wire fraud and of "tampering with, destroying and fabricating evidence in a scheme to defraud the Facebook founder of billions of dollars." Ceglia is accused of fabricating emails to make it appear that he and Zuckerberg discussed details about an early version of Facebook, although after examining their emails, investigators found there was no mention of Facebook in them.[71] Some law firms withdrew from the case before it was initiated and others after Ceglia's arrest.[72][73]
A movie based on Zuckerberg and the founding years of Facebook, The Social Network was released on October 1, 2010, and stars Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg. After Zuckerberg was told about the film, he responded, "I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive."[74] Also, after the film's script was leaked on the Internet and it was apparent that the film would not portray Zuckerberg in a wholly positive light, he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a "good guy".[75] The film is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich, which the book's publicist once described as "big juicy fun" rather than "reportage".[76] The film's screenwriter Aaron Sorkin told New York magazine, "I don't want my fidelity to be to the truth; I want it to be to storytelling", adding, "What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good?"[77]
Upon winning the Golden Globes award for Best Picture on January 16, 2011, producer Scott Rudin thanked Facebook and Zuckerberg "for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a metaphor through which to tell a story about communication and the way we relate to each other.”[78] Sorkin, who won for Best Screenplay, retracted some of the impressions given in his script:[79]
"I wanted to say to Mark Zuckerberg tonight, if you're watching, Rooney Mara's character makes a prediction at the beginning of the movie. She was wrong. You turned out to be a great entrepreneur, a visionary, and an incredible altruist."
On January 29, 2011, Zuckerberg made a surprise guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, which was being hosted by Jesse Eisenberg. They both said it was the first time they ever met.[80] Eisenberg asked Zuckerberg, who had been critical of his portrayal by the film, what he thought of the movie. Zuckerberg replied, "It was interesting."[81] In a subsequent interview about their meeting, Eisenberg explains that he was "nervous to meet him, because I had spent now, a year and a half thinking about him ..." He adds, "Mark has been so gracious about something that’s really so uncomfortable ... The fact that he would do SNL and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous. It’s the best possible way to handle something that, I think, could otherwise be very uncomfortable."[82][83]
Jeff Jarvis, author of the book Public Parts, interviewed Zuckerberg and believes Sorkin made up too much of the story. He states, "That's what the internet is accused of doing, making stuff up, not caring about the facts."[84]
According to David Kirkpatrick, former technology editor at Fortune magazine and author of The Facebook Effect:The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World, (2011),[85] "the film is only "40% true ... he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way, the way Zuckerberg is played in the movie." He says that "a lot of the factual incidents are accurate, but many are distorted and the overall impression is false", and concludes that primarily "his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the internet".[84]
Although the film portrays Zuckerberg's creation of Facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite final clubs at Harvard, Zuckerberg himself said he had no interest in joining the clubs.[2] Kirkpatrick agrees that the impression implied by the film is "false". Karel Baloun, a former senior engineer at Facebook, notes that the "image of Zuckerberg as a socially inept nerd is overstated..... It is fiction....." He likewise dismisses the film's assertion that he "would deliberately betray a friend".[84]
Zuckerberg voiced himself on an episode of The Simpsons titled "Loan-a Lisa", which first aired on October 3, 2010. In the episode, Lisa Simpson and her friend Nelson encounter Zuckerberg at an entrepreneurs' convention. Zuckerberg tells Lisa that she does not need to graduate from college to be wildly successful, referencing Bill Gates and Richard Branson as examples.[86]
On October 9, 2010, Saturday Night Live lampooned Zuckerberg and Facebook.[87] Andy Samberg played Zuckerberg. The real Zuckerberg was reported to have been amused: "I thought this was funny."[88]
Stephen Colbert awarded a "Medal of Fear" to Zuckerberg at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear on October 30, 2010, "because he values his privacy much more than he values yours".[89]
Zuckerberg created an account with Google+ soon after the social network was unveiled, saying he sees it as a "validation for his vision" of online social networking.[90] By July 2011, Zuckerberg had become the most followed user on Google+, outranking Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.[91] As of March 6, 2012, his ranking has dropped to 184 on the service, behind Page and Brin.[92] His public profile is minimal with one photo and a bio that reads "I make things".[93]
Zuckerberg has maintained a private account on Twitter under the username "zuck", and in 2009 he revealed that the public account "finkd" also belonged to him.[94]
Zuckerberg donated an undisclosed amount to Diaspora, an open-source personal web server that implements a distributed social networking service. He called it a "cool idea".[42]
Zuckerberg founded the Start-up: Education foundation.[95][96] On September 22, 2010, it was reported that Zuckerberg had donated $100million to Newark Public Schools, the public school system of Newark, New Jersey.[97][98] Critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of The Social Network, which painted a somewhat negative portrait of Zuckerberg.[99] Zuckerberg responded to the criticism, saying, "The thing that I was most sensitive about with the movie timing was, I didn't want the press about The Social Network movie to get conflated with the Newark project. I was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate."[100] Newark Mayor Cory A. Booker stated that he and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had to convince Zuckerberg's team not to make the donation anonymously.[100]
On December 9, 2010, Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and investor Warren Buffett signed a promise they called the "Giving Pledge", in which they promised to donate to charity at least half of their wealth over the course of time, and invited others among the wealthy to donate 50% or more of their wealth to charity.[101]
On December 19, 2013, Zuckerberg announced a donation of 18 million Facebook shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, to be executed by the end of the month—based on Facebook's valuation as of then, the shares totaled $990 million in value. On December 31, 2013, the donation was recognized as the largest charitable gift on public record for 2013.[102] The Chronicle of Philanthropy reported on February 10, 2014 that Zuckerberg's donation was the largest charitable gift on the public record in 2013 and put Zuckerberg and his wife at the top of the magazine's annual list of 50 most generous Americans in 2013, having donated roughly 1 billion dollars to charity.[6]
In 2002, Zuckerberg registered to vote in Westchester County, New York, where he grew up, but did not cast a ballot until November 2008. Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters Spokeswoman, Elma Rosas, told Bloomberg that Zuckerberg is listed as “no preference” on voter rolls, and he voted in the past two general elections, in 2008 and 2012.[103][104] On Zuckerberg's Facebook page, he has Chris Christie, Cory Booker, Nicolas Sarkozy, and Barack Obama in his likes section.[105]
Mark Zuckerberg has never specified his own political views: some consider him a conservative,[106][107] while others consider him liberal.[108] Numerous liberal and progressive groups, such as The League of Conservation Voters, MoveOn.org, the Sierra Club, Democracy for America, CREDO, Daily Kos, 350.org, and Presente and Progressives United have all have agreed to either pull their Facebook ad buys or hold off on buying Facebook ads for at least two weeks. It was to protest to Mark Zuckerberg over ads funded by FWD.us by touting the support for oil drilling and the Keystone XL pipeline and opposition to Obamacare among Republican US senators who back immigration reform.[clarification needed][109]
On February 13, 2013, Zuckerberg hosted his first ever fundraising event for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Zuckerberg's particular interest on this occasion was education reform, and Christie's education reform work focused on teachers unions and the expansion of charter schools.[110][111] Later that year, Zuckerberg would host a campaign fundraiser for Newark mayor Cory Booker, who was running in the 2013 New Jersey special Senate election.[112] In September 2010, with the support of Governor Chris Christie, Booker obtained a $100 million pledge from Zuckerberg to Newark Public Schools.[113] In December 2012, Zuckerberg donated 18 million shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, a community organization that includes education in its list of grant-making areas.[114][115]
On April 11, 2013, Zuckerberg led the launch of a 501(c)(4) lobbying group called FWD.us. The founders and contributors to the group were primarily Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors, and its president was Joe Green, a close friend of Zuckerberg.[116][117][118][119] The goals of the group include immigration reform, improving the state of education in the US, and enabling more technological breakthroughs that benefit the public,[120][121] yet it has also been criticized for financing ads advocating a variety of oil and gas development initiatives, including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Keystone XL pipeline.[122]
A media report on June 20, 2013 revealed that Zuckerberg actively engaged with Facebook users on his own profile page after the online publication of a FWD.us video. In response to a claim that the FWD.us organization is "just about tech wanting to hire more people", the Internet entrepreneur replied: "The bigger problem we’re trying to address is ensuring the 11 million undocumented folks living in this country now and similar folks in the future are treated fairly."[123]
In June 2013, Zuckerberg joined Facebook employees in a company float as part of the annual San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Celebration. The company first participated in the event in 2011, with 70 employees, and this number increased to 700 for the 2013 march. The 2013 pride celebration was especially significant, as it followed a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that deemed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) unconstitutional.[124][125]
When questioned about the mid-2013 PRISM scandal at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in September 2013, Zuckerberg stated that the U.S. government "blew it." He further explained that the government performed poorly in regard to the protection of the freedoms of its citizens, the economy, and companies.[55]
At a party put on by his fraternity during his sophomore year, Zuckerberg met Priscilla Chan,[126][127] a fellow student whom he began dating in 2003. Chan is the child of a Chinese-Vietnamese refugee, who arrived in the U.S. after the Fall of Saigon. She was born in Braintree, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, and is a 2003 graduate of Quincy High School.[128][129] In September 2010, Zuckerberg invited Chan, by then a medical student at the University of California, San Francisco,[130] to move into his rented Palo Alto house. Zuckerberg studied Mandarin Chinese in preparation for the couple's visit to the People's Republic of China in December 2010.[131][132]
On May 19, 2012, Zuckerberg and Chan married in Zuckerberg's backyard in a celebration also marking her graduation from medical school.[133][134][135]
On Zuckerberg's Facebook page, he listed his personal interests as "openness, making things that help people connect and share what's important to them, revolutions, information flow, minimalism".[136] Zuckerberg sees blue best because of red–green color blindness; blue is also Facebook's dominant color.[137]

In this success story we are going to share Mark Zuckerberg biography, the youngest billionaire on the planet who created Facebook social network that now has 1 billion monthly active users.
Thanks to Facebook people around the world can easily keep in touch with all their friends. Not long ago, society just did not have such opportunity, but now everything has changed. However, Facebook is not limited only to communication and acquaintances. There are numerous interest groups and fan pages that help to rally the people together. This is not counting the fact Facebook is also a huge database of profiles, exceeding the most popular dating sites and chances to find your second half are impressive.
Mark Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984 and grew up in the suburbs of New York, Dobbs Ferry. He was the second of four children and the only son in the educated family. Mark’s father, Edward Zuckerberg, is a dentist and mother, Karen Zuckerberg, is a psychiatrist. His father owned a dental practice next to the family house. Mark and his three sisters, Arielle, Randi and Donna were raised in Dobbs Ferry, New York.
Mark got interested in programming yet in elementary school. The fact that the world is divided between programmers and users, Mark found out when he was 10 years old and got his first PC Quantex 486DX on the Intel 486.
From Mark Zuckerberg biography we found out he was taught Atari BASIC Programming by his father and when Mark was about 12, he used Atari BASIC to create a messenger, which he called “ZuckNet”. It made all the computers connected to each other and allowed to transfer messages between the house and dental office. His father installed the messenger on his computer in his dentist office and the receptionist could inform him when a new patient arrived. Mark also enjoyed developing games and communication tools and as he said he was doing it just for fun. His father, Edward Zuckerberg, even hired a computer tutor David Newman who gave his son some private lessons.
Also being at high school, Mark wrote an artificially intelligent media player Synapse for MP3-playlists that carefully studied the preferences of a user and was able to generate playlists ‘guessing’, which tracks user wants to listen to right now. Microsoft and AOL got unusual interest in Synapse media player and wanted to buy it out. However, the young talent rejected the offer of IT-giants and then politely rejected their invitation to cooperate. Just like that, Mark Zuckerberg refused from dozens, maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars, and work in one of the top IT-corporations.
Soon Mark Zuckerberg studied at the Academy of Phillips Exeter, an exclusive preparatory school in New Hampshire. He showed good results there in science and literature, receiving a degree in classics. He also showed a great talent in fencing and even became the school captain of the fencing team. Yet Mark Zuckerberg stayed fascinated by coding and wanted to work on the development of new software.
In 2002, after graduating Phillips Exeter, Zuckerberg entered Harvard University. By his second year at the Ivy League he had gained a reputation as a software developer on campus. It was then when he wrote a program CourseMatch, which helped students choose their subjects on the basis of lists of courses from other users.
In 2003, once summer evening when Mark Zuckerberg suffered from insomnia in the Harvard dormitory room, he got an idea to create a site called FaceMash. Mark decided to hack the database of Harvard, where the students uploaded their profile pictures. He quickly wrote a program that randomly selected two pictures of two random female students and put them next to each other, asking “Who is hotter?”, giving the option for voting.
The process was in full swing and site was visited by most of the students in Harvard. When the number of visitors exceeded the limit, the server crashed due to overload. Mark appeared before the committee on computer hacking. Of course nobody told Mark Zuckerberg ‘Well done!’ and he received a disciplinary action, and had noticed that such kind of things cause stormy interest in society. By the way, Harvard has refused to comment on the incident up till now.
About ten months before the Zuckerberg’s FaceMash epic, one of the students of Harvard – Divya Narendra – had already spoken with the idea of creating a social network exclusively for Harvard students, many of whom were suffering from emotional stiffness. And not have ‘aliens’ engaged into the network, Narendra suggested using Harvard email address as the main username.
Divya Narendra’s partners were twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. The father of the Winklevoss twins, Howard Winklevoss, is a successful financial consultant and put in his sons a lot of efforts and money – so the problem with the initial capital for the future network could be solved easily.
In conversation with Mark Narendra said that the project would be called Harvard Connection (later renamed to ConnectU), and its members will be posted to the Internet their photos, personal information and useful links. The tasks of Mark Zuckerberg included programming of the site and creating a special source code, which would allow the system to work as quickly as possible.
After a private meeting with Narendra and the Winklevoss twins, Zuckerberg agreed to join in the work, but the potential of his new partners he estimated it skeptically. While working on Harvard Connection he got a fantastic idea about his own social network.
On February 04, 2004 he registered the domain name TheFacebook.com, now known throughout the world as Facebook.com. However, it functioned only within Harvard.
After Zuckerberg and his partner Eduardo Saverin realized that there were already registered 4000 users, they have come to the conclusion that they needed the services of new programmers. One of them was a Mark’s neighbor, Darren Moskowitz, who further opened the Facebook service to students at Columbia University, Stanford, and Yale.
Around the same time after the IPO, Zuckerberg owned 503.6 million shares. And now Zuckerberg controls nearly 60% of the company’s votes, 35% – Eduardo Saverin, and 5% went to newcomer Moskowitz. Another friend of Mark, Chris Hughes, was assigned as the Press attache of Facebook.
Some time later, the registration was opened to all students. The main condition was the availability of an email address in .edu zone, which also indicated a person’s belonging to education sector.
It must be said that at first this tactic worked out nicely. The project attracted audience attention of sufficient quality. When a user was trying to sign up he had to fill out a detailed profile, and in addition to the email address in .edu zone it was requested to add a real profile picture. If people used avatars instead of real pictures their profiles were deleted.
Soon Facebook went beyond the education sector, becoming more and more popular. Mark Zuckerberg started looking for investors. The first investments Mark received from one of the founders of PayPal, Peter Thiel, who is well known throughout Silicon Valley. Peter Thiel allocated $500,000 dollars and that amount was sufficient for immediate Facebook purposes. The project began to evolve rapidly. In less than a year after it was founded more than 1 million people joined the social network. For further development of Facebook they needed more investments. Accel Partners invested in Facebook $12.7 million dollars and then Greylock Partners added to this amount $27.5 million dollars.
By 2005, Facebook became accessible for all educational institutions and universities in the USA. Zuckerberg still believed that his project is a social network for students, but the interest of users to Facebook grew exponentially. Then it was decided to make a registration accessible to the public. And after this a Facebook ‘epidemic’ started.
The main thing that immediately attracted users in Facebook, is that friends who meet in real life now could communicate with each other online. It was something new.
Facebook audience grew rapidly, but the monetization of the project still remained unclear. Everyone expected that the main instrument should be context advertising. The fact is that every Facebook user fills sufficiently detailed profile, which can be used to show relevant advertisements. Obviously that would open up enough options to advertisers, who may be of interest to their audience. But Facebook continued  just to build number of users. When they got over 50 million users, large companies began to offer Zuckerberg to sale them the project. So, one time even Yahoo! offered $900 million dollars for Facebook. Impressive sum, but it absolutely did not satisfy Mark. Facebook biography and Mark Zuckerberg success story is quite intriguing, isn’t it?
The Facebook project launch was accompanied by series of scandals. Six days later after launching the site senior students brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and Divya Narendra accused Mark Zuckerberg in stoling their idea. They claimed that in 2003 hired Zuckerberg to make him complete the establishment of the social network HarvardConnection.com. According to their testimonies, Zuckerberg did not provide them the results of his work, but used the original source code to create Facebook.
In the same year, Narendra and the Winklevoss twins launched their own network renamed to ConnectU. And they continued to attack on Mark Zuckerberg, complaining Harvard administration and The Harvard Crimson newspaper. Initially Zuckerberg urged journalists not to publish the investigation: he showed them what supposedly he did for HarvardConnection, and explained that those developments did not have any relation to Facebook. But very inappropriately, another Harvard student – John Thomson – in personal conversations started saying that Zuckerberg stole one of his ideas for Facebook. The newspaper decided to publish the article and it offended Mark Zuckerberg very much.
Zuckerberg took revenge on The Harvard Crimson. According to Silicon Alley Insider, in 2004, he breaks the mailboxes of two journalists from The Harvard Crimson, using the newly launched Facebook. He found users who were involved in the newspaper and browsed their logs (i.e. history) of incorrectly entered passwords in Facebook. Zuckerberg’s expectations were met: two employees of the newspaper absentmindedly tried to login Facebook with passwords from their mailboxes. Silicon Alley Insider wrote that Zuckerberg got lucky: he had a chance to read the correspondence about him between the editorial office and HarvardConnection.
The Winklevoss twins and Narendra filed a lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg, but the court rejected their claim. They were persistent and filed another lawsuit. This time the court examined the code sources to understand whether they were actually stolen. But the truth was still not clear. The examination results were not announced. In 2009, Zuckerberg agreed to pay $45 million ($20 million in cash, and the remaining amount in Facebook shares) ConnectU as part of the court settlement. The case was closed. By that time ConnectU had less than 100,000 users, Facebook boasted about 150 million users.
The Winklevoss twins yet did not calm down and filed a petition in the U.S. Court of Appeals, but they were denied a retrial. According to their lawyer Jerome Falk, the appellate court refused to take a review of the case based only on the parties’ settlement agreement, which states that members of the trial after the signing of the document does not have the right to resume the trial. In counsel’s view, the decision was illegal, as Mark Zuckerberg in a proceeding in 2008 provided false information about the company’s value.
On May 17, 2011 Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss filed another lawsuit against the owner of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg to the U.S. Supreme Court. That was the latest attempt of the brothers to make the court to reconsider the case.
In 2007, a major event happened to Facebook. Microsoft acquired 1.6% equity stake in Facebook for an impressive amount of $240 million dollars. On this basis, a number of analysts suggested that the total value of Facebook reaches $15 billion. Quite good results for the company, whose income did not exceed $200 million a year. After the deal Bill Gates created an account in Facebook. He used to spend for several hours a day to communicate through Facebook with everyone, but after a time decided to close his account for some time, because there were too many people willing to chat with him. Physically, he was not able to chat with all of them. However, Gates provided a major PR campaign for Facebook worldwide. This is particularly important for Microsoft, given that it had an exclusive advertising agreement with the social network until 2011.
In 2011, the turnover of Facebook, Inc. reached $3.71 billion and net income – $1 billion. The growth rates are also impressive: three years turnover has increased five-fold.
Basis earnings of Facebook come from contextual ads on the pages of social network. Growing number of users and the time they spend on the site is converted into advertising revenues. 85% percent of cash-flow that went through the company last year was earned through contextual advertising.
Most of the rest 15% are deductions from purchases made through the Facebook payment system. These are mostly not real, but virtual goods. For example seeds, fruits and vegetables, purchased by fans of the popular game Farmville developed by Zynga.
Despite the apparent frivolity, virtual goods is a serious business, and the Facebook report confirms that. The company estimates that in 2010 the global market turnover for virtual goods reached $7 billion, and by 2014 it will rise to $15 billion.
At the beginning of January 2013, Facebook Inc. started testing the service of paid private messaging. Facebook charges $1.00 for a private message that you can send to the users who are not in your friend list. And the message goes directly to their Inbox folder, instead of Other one. But Facebook went further and realized that some users are worth more than a $1. If you want to send a message to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and get into his inbox, you might have to pay $100 for this exclusive option. This is another very simple way to generate additional revenue.
In January 2010, TIME magazine named Facebook founder, CEO and 26-year old billionaire Mark Zuckerberg the Person of the Year 2010.
Lady Gaga, James Cameron and founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, were struggling for this title that year. However, TIME magazine chose his hero. ‘The social network created by Mark connected almost every tenth person on the planet’, – Richard Stengel, TIME editor-in-chief explained their choice. According to him, ‘Today, Facebook is the third largest country in the world that knows about its citizens as much as no government on planet does.’
According to TIME, in the past year no one else had such great impact on the world than the current winner. Mark’s popularity is so high that in 2010 David Fincher shot a movie ‘The Social Network’ in which the main role of Facebook founder was brilliantly played by Jesse Eisenberg. Previously, TIME’s ‘persons of the year’ became the United States presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.
In 2010, Forbes magazine admitted Mark Zuckerberg as the youngest billionaire in its list to the state of $4 billion.
In the rating of the 400 richest people in the United States, published by Forbes magazine in 2012, Zuckerberg took 36th place with a fortune of $9.4 billion.
Currently Zuckerberg lives in the Palo Alto in a $7 million estate that features 5 bedrooms a saltwater pool, and over 5,000 square feet of property.
On May 19, 2012 Mark Zuckerberg married his longtime girlfriend Priscilla Chan in Palo Alto, California and finally they happy live together.
We hope you have enjoyed reading Mark Zuckerberg biography and breathtaking success story of Facebook and it has inspired you to new discoveries.
Even if Mark Zuckerberg copied the idea of some one, it was done only after others failed to recognise its potential. He grabbed a chance instead of waiting for others.
I totally agree with you, Remilla. I think Mark Zuckerberg could create Facebook just being in the right place at the right time.

August 27 | Posted by Entrepreneur Writer | Famous Entrepreneurs, Richest People In The World, Teenage Entrepreneurs, The Best Companies To Work For, Youngest Millionaires
On May 14th 1984 Mark Zuckerberg was born. Currently he is only 29 and he is one of the 5 founders of the biggest social networking sites – Facebook. In 2013 his net worth was estimated at $16.8 billion US.
In middle school he began to write software and use computers. He learned Atari basic programming and a tutor he had considered a “prodigy.” At high school Mark excelled in his classes he won prizes in astronomy, physics, and mathematics. While he was still in high school, he took a college graduate program in computer programming. He built a program called Zucknet where the computer at home could communicate with his father’s computer at his dental practice. He also used his creativity to build computer games often out of ideas his friends would draw for him. When he eventually went to go to college, he claimed to be able to read and write in Latin, French, Hebrew, English and Greek. His overall knowledge and intelligence helped him excel at college, where he would often recite poems such as the epic ‘The Iliad’.

In college he was already known as a “programming prodigy” due to the work he had done in high school. There he wrote a program he called CourseMatch that helped students make decisions about the courses they wanted to take based upon the choices of others.
In college the students had books called “Facebooks.” They had the pictures and names of people that lived in the student dorms. Mark build a website, where there were two pictures of males and two of females. People that visited the site had to choose which person was hotter. This site went up over one weekend and it was called Facemash. However, the college shut it down because the popularity of it kept students from getting onto the Internet. Also some students didn’t like the idea of their pictures being used and Zuckerberg was forced to apologize for his actions.
In 2004 he began writing a new website which he called TheFacebook. He had several students help him with TheFacebook including Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, and Dustin Moskovitz. The site was initially just a Harvard site but soon expanded to other colleges and universities. By 2005 “TheFacebook” was known just as Facebook. The site opened up to anyone over age 13 in 2006. By 2007 the site had over 100,000 businesses listing their companies on Facebook and creating pages. By 2011 it became the largest digital photograph host and had over 350 million accessing the site over mobile phones.
On May 18th 2012 Facebook made its IPO (initial public offering), offering 421 million shares to private investors at the price of $38. This set the value of the whole company at $104 billion, which made Facebook the biggest business going public till then. Almost everybody wanted to buy a piece of the booming social miracle, so rising almost $16 billion from the market was like a walk in the park. However, things didn’t went well for investors. Just two weeks after the IPO, the market price of the shares fell dramatically by 27% to $27.72 per share. During the next months the price even further, reaching level around $19 . All this didn’t made investors really happy, some of whom lost around 50% of their investments for a few months. More than 40 lawsuits were filled the first week after the IPO. The price has recovered in 2013 and currently it’s around $41.
Mark Zuckerberg was named to the 100 wealthiest and most influential people in the world list put out by Time magazine in 2010. Zuckerberg who is also Jewish, is listed as one of the most influential Jews in the world as well. His net worth is estimated at 16.8 billion in 2013 and currently he is the CEO (Chief Executive Officer) of the social company. There is no doubt that Facebook has changed the way we communicate online and today it remains a very popular site thanks to this young entrepreneur.

Mark Zuckerberg, the man of the hour and Time person of the year, 2010, is the founder and CEO of Facebook. His creation is on road to become one of the most valuable tech companies of the world as Facebook debuts at the Nasdaq stock exchange on 18th May, 2012. At $38 per share, the Facebook has a market capitalization of $104 billion, making it not only one of the biggest in Silicon Valley, but one of the biggest in the world. Mark's 443 million shares are worth $16.9 billion at $38 a share. 
 In the filed listing it was revealed that Facebook's revenue was an astounding $3.7 billion while it generated $1 billion in profit.   Mark himself earned a handsome base salary of $500, 000 amounting to an annual $1.7 million pay package.   Owning  28 % share of Facebook, he will be worth 28 billion USD once the company becomes public and will be standing at front in the queue of richest persons on the planet. 
 Born on May 14, 1984 to Edward Zuckerberg and Karen Zuckerberg, Mark was a child prodigy, programming and creating games at the age, when one is usually playing them. He repeatedly asserted his extraordinary potential as a computer programmer through different inventions. In his early teens he created a music player named Synapse as a school project using some help from a friend, which used artificial intelligence to understand one’s taste in music and created a playlist accordingly. Software bigwigs like Microsoft and AOL tried to buy it and even recruit Mark. But he refused both. Instead he went to Harvard in 2002. On Feb 4, 2004, with the help of his roommates, Dutsin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes and using the finance provided by another friend Eduardo Saverin, he launched what was called then, The Facebook. It was an instant hit, and soon made Mark the next big thing.  
In 2007, he was named as the world’s youngest billionaire and continues to dominate the internet space like no one else. His site, which has ubiquitous presence all across the globe, has now over 850 million members, which in terms of population can be termed as the third largest entity after China and India. A man of radical notions and tremendous genius, Mark wants the world to be a more open place, where every person is connected to other, sharing their personnel lives and dreams that his invention, Facebook would be successful in doing that. 
"The web is at a really important turning point right now. Up until recently, the default on the web has been that most things aren’t social and most things don’t use your real identity. We’re building toward a web where the default is social."
""When you give everyone a voice and give people power, the system usually ends up in a really good place. So, what we view our role as, is giving people that power.""
"There's lots of stuff none of us have ever seen before. That's good in some ways, but limiting in other ways.”"
According to Mark at the house Facebook rented during the summer of 2004, "there was a fair amount of pot smoking, though Zuckerberg frowned on it and didn't partake."
The day after the Accel investment, Mark Zuckerberg was at a gas station when a crazy guy with a gun came at him. Zuck jumped in his SUV and drove away
Steve Chen worked at Facebook for a few weeks before quitting to do his own startup. It was called YouTube
Mark Zuckerberg didn't want to add photo-sharing to Facebook, but Sean Parker convinced him to. Facebook is now the most popular photo-sharing site.
His first place was a sparse one-bedroom apartment that a friend described as something like a “crack den.” The next apartment was a two-bedroom, followed by his current place, a two-story, four-bedroom house that he said is “too big.” 
Wondering why all facebook is painted blue. It’s because mark is red-green colour blind and blue is the richest color for him.
Mark obtained restraining order against one Pradeep Manukonda, who he claimed was stalking him, even trying to contact him through emails. According to Mark, he was fearful of his and his sister’s and girlfriend’s safety.
The West Wing is one of the favorite TV series of Mark. Incidentally the screenplay of this series has been written by none other than Aaron Sorkin who has also written the screenplay of The Social Network.
The Social Network is a movie that was made based on the book, The Accidental Billionaires, by Ben Mezrich. Mark criticized the movie as it presented him as an unsmiling, insecure and sexed-up young man. Mezrich based his book heavily on his interviews with Eduardo Saverin, who was the initial business manager of Facebook. But they both had a falling out and Saverin shares were diluted to 0.3 % from 30%. Saverin later sued Zuckerberg and they eventually reached a non disclosure agreement for an undisclosed amount of money and share in Facebook.
Since its inception, Facebook and more appropriately Mark has been surrounded by various controversies and lawsuits. According to reports Mark was approached by three Harvard seniors, the Winklevoss twins and Divya Narendra to work on their project HarvardConnect, which was later launched as ConnectU. However, Mark soon abandoned their project and launched his own site which was called The Facebook then. According to Winklevoss twins, Mark misled them on the development of their site, keeping them blind while using their idea to develop his own site. “He stole the moment, he stole the idea, and he stole the execution” that’s what Cameron Winklevoss said to the Newyorker reporter. Eventually they reached a settlement of US $65 million. But the dispute is still on.
World’s youngest billionaire Mark Zuckerberg owns a house in Palo Alto which is his first property investment. Prior to this he has always stayed in rented apartment. The house is just a 10-minute drive from what will soon be Facebook's new headquarters in Menlo Park. He lives in this house with his college sweetheart Priscilla Chan. The young billionaire has long been a fan of renting and of relatively modest digs.
Location: The house is located in one of the posh locality of California, Palo Alto which is situated in the northwest corner of Santa Clara County.
Accommodation: The house sits in the area of 5,1617-square-foot, was originally built in 1903. Since the house is of historic times it boasts gorgeous historical elements, like sash windows, coffered ceilings, French doors, and deep porches. The house has total of 5-bedroom, 5.5-bath and purchased for $ 7 million. Although the house is grand but still is modest compared to his other Silicon Valley contemporaries. In addition, this two storied house also has a saltwater pool, a music alcove, spacious porch and a large kitchen with adjoining breakfast area. The master bedroom suite has a spa-inspired Carrara marble bath with heated floors, which add some elegance to otherwise this simple, if not frugal piece of property.
Recent SEC filing about Facebook's finances have revealed that the Facebook's founder spent around $700,000 for costs related to private jets. The listing states that "Facebook has authorized its  CEO and COO to use private aircraft for business purposes. This practice maximizes such executives’ productive time and ensures their quick availability. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg may use private aircraft for personal purposes in connection with his comprehensive security program. On certain occasions, Mr. Zuckerberg may be accompanied by family members or others when using private aircraft. For flights involving passengers flying for personal purposes, the aggregate incremental cost of such personal usage is reported as other compensation to Mr. Zuckerberg. " Another $90,850 of that amount was for “costs related to estate and financial planning.”
Mark drives an Acura TSX, which is an entry level luxury sedan. It uses a 2.4 litre in-line 4 cylinder engine which can churn out 201 hp and 172 lb-ft torque. It has a 5 -speed automatic transmission, which comes with steering-wheel paddle shifters for optional manual shifting. The car is quite packed with luxury features like leather interior, automatic climate control, a seven-speaker sound system, Satellite Radio, Bluetooth and HandsFreeLink. The car is priced at around 30, 000$
Luxurious interiors and seven speaker sound system which makes Mark's Accura TSX different from others. 
The Facebook CEO recently got married to his long time college sweetheart Priscilla Chan on May 19, 2012, in an astonishing ceremony at his home in Palo Alto, California. The propitious wedding was kept behind the curtains in such a way that even the guests were unaware about such a ceremony to happen, as they were expecting celebration for Priscilla Chan’s graduation from the University of California.
Chan looked a complete angel wearing her elegant sleeveless white gown featuring an illusion lace neckline and a transparent white veil while Mark made a striking presence in his wedding sporting a slender dark blue suit and tie, and a pure white shirt. The wedding ring was a simple Ruby sparkler designed by Zuckerberg for her adorable sweetheart.
The auspicious wedding was attended by around 100 close guests of the couple and featured delicious Mexican food along with a remarkable presentation by Green Day’s “Billie Joe Armstrong” for entertainment. Zuckerberg announced the nuptial on his social networking site “Facebook”, via a status update, posting his wedding picture which was liked by more than 280,000 people. Just a day before the celebrated wedding, Facebook’s fortune rose to £12billion in the stock market.
The billionaire Facebook founder was spotted having a good time in Vietnam with his Chinese-American wife Priscilla Chan and some friends. Vietnam is a communist country where Zuckerberg’s social networking site is blocked, but this doesn’t mean they won’t welcome the Facebook CEO. Mark visited the place in December 2011 and spent the Christmas Eve in the tourist hot spot Ha Long Bay and later on Christmas Day at a lodge in the town Sapa. Mark spent almost $6,000 on travelling by a private helicopter, exploring the gorgeous place with Chan, and was even seen enjoying a slow ride on a horned beast in Sapa.
Location: Vietnam is the world’s 13th most heavily populated country on the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia. 
Accommodation: Vietnam offers plenty of choices for the visitors to have a comfortable stay in the country. A number of gorgeous hotels and resorts welcome the visitors with their authentic warmth and sincere hospitality. The world class accommodation facilities make the stay a pleasant and enjoyable one for the guests.
Main Attraction: The world-renowned vacation destination attracts the visitors with its diverse beauty and charm and has something for everyone. The visitors can get extreme delight exploring the country's marvelous beaches, tropical forests, mountains, gorgeous lakes and waterfalls and beautiful sunsets.

There is more to life than just Facebook! Well, It seems Mark Zuckerberg has finally understood this. He took some time away from The Social Network headquarters to celebrate his marriage with his wife, Priscilla Chan. The newlyweds tied the knot in a surprise and simple ceremony in California on May 20.
Just like their wedding, the honeymoon promises to be a low key one. They have sneaked into Italy for their honeymoon where they will be dining out, visit the tourist attractions and steal romantic moments. The honeymoon seems surprisingly low key for a newly wed billionaire couple who has just earned hard cash as much as worth $17 billlion! They have already visited the famous sites of the country including the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain. On 28th they were photographed whilst on a guided tour of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. They have been dining out in many restaurants including a Kosher restaurant in the Jewish Ghetto in Rome. After dinner they usually take a walk holding each other's hands. If you are thinking that the couple is not splurging at all, then you are wrong. They came to Italy by a private jet and are staying in a 5-star hotel called Portrait Suites where the room charges starts from $1000/night.
On 29th of May the media splashed pictures of the couple enjoying the sea. They were aboard a Pershing Yacht  and touring the Amalfi Coast in Italy. It seems that their honeymoon is going the right way.
Billionaire chairman and CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg is very simple and humble when it comes to holidays and vacations. He spent the Christmas of 2012 enjoying the pleasures of sea surfing along with his wife, Priscilla Chan at the Hawaiian Islands. Both of them are excellent surfers and Hawaii was the perfect vacation spot for the winter. They spent the remaining time tanning, tweeting and using the new Facebook 'Poke' which sends fleeting messages.
Accommodation: There is no dearth of accommodation on the Hawaiian islands. Cheaper options are possible by choosing hotels on the islands of Maui, O'ahu or Moloka'i.
Main Attractions: The sun-kissed beaches, winding hiking trails, photogenic landscapes and lush greenery surrounding the blue coves of water that one will find in plenty at Hawaii are a strong attractant for any visitor.
The best thing to do for the first timer would be to go on an excursion to the different islands, hopping and dipping into the joys that they offer. Surfing, swimming, diving, sunbathing and relaxing on the beach are the most popular options.
You could also go dolphin/whale watching as you keep an eye around for the host of celebrities that descend to this tourist hotspot. Those with a love for history should take time to visit the Pearl Harbor and the nearby museum there. Volcanoes abound on these islands and volcano-watching is a good pastime. There are options for world-class golf too.
Following in footsteps of many Silicon Valley billionaires, Zuckerberg believes in donating his wealth for noble causes. He has founded the Start-up: Education foundation. On the Oprah show one night, Zuckerberg announced that he would be donating $100 million to Newark Public Schools, the public school system of Newark, New Jersey. He wanted to do this anonymously, however, Newark Mayor Cory A. Booker along with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie convinced Zuckerberg not to make the donation anonymously.
The Giving Pledge is an initiative on behalf of Bill Gates and Warren Buffet to make the world’s billionaires to promise to donate half or more of their wealth to charity, either while they are alive or after their death. On December 9, 2010, Zuckerberg, also signed the pledge along with Bill Gates and Mr. Buffet.
Facebook CEO Mark Zukerberg has donated funds to the Silicon Valley Charity with the intention to focus in areas like education and health issues. Mark’s 18 million shares in Facebook worth around $500 million were received by the non-profit organization in addition to the money donated by Zukerberg’s wife Priscilla Chan. The gift is reportedly the largest single philanthropic donation to educational causes from Mark till date. The NGO, which is dedicated to offering solutions to life changing problems, has received close to $2.5 billion of funds in five years and has won several recognitions and awards for its charitable acts.
Mark Zuckerberg and his girlfriend has recently got for themselves a Hungarian Puli puppy, which they have strangely named Beast. Also known as Hungarian Water Dog, this is a very intelligent breed of dogs and also have excellent agility. Loyal to their owners, these dogs are usually possessive of their owners and territories. Although they are fun-loving and courageous, they can prove to be stubborn and aggressive at times. They have a shiny and thick coat, which covers almost 99 percent of their body. Regardless of the coat texture, they are truly beautiful and charming.
The world’s youngest billionaire prefers wearing a Signature hoodie for casual as well as formal events. Mark was recently spotted sporting a black tone Signature hoodie to attend one of his investors meeting. Zuckerberg’s sweat shirt outfit for an important business meet might have been a mark of immaturity as per his business clients, but it was a true mark of style for the Facebook CEO, who looked extremely dashing in his chic attire. The Facebook CEO’s favorite hoodie bears his company’s social mission printed on the inner side, which says “to make the world more open and connected”, which might be the reason why he adores wearing them.

=======================================================
              Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's success comes from taking risks and keeping a casual yet productive office environment.
	Mark Zuckerberg is a technology innovator, CEO, Internet mogul and philanthropist who earned multi-billionaire status by his mid-20s. As the cofounder, chairman, and CEO of Facebook, Zuckerberg redefined the social media market and connected people in ways never thought possible.
	Zuckerberg recently topped a list of "Highest Rated CEOs" from online career community Glassdoor. The list was the result of employee reviews over the past 12 months.
	Born into a well-educated family in New York, Zuckerberg developed an interest in computers at an early stage. He created his own messaging program at the age of 12, dubbed "Zucknet," which his father used in his dental office. He would create games and programs under a private computer tutor, who later told reporters that it was hard to stay ahead of the technology prodigy. While still in high school, companies like AOL and Microsoft expressed interest in buying his software and hiring him, which he declined.
	Later enrolling at Harvard University, Zuckerberg developed a reputation as a strong programmer and software developer. He created programs like CourseMatch, which helped students choose their classes based on the selections of their peers, and Facemash, which compared pictures of two students and allowed users to vote on who was more attractive. While popular, none of these programs matched to the later success of Zuckerberg's development of Facebook.
	Approached by Divya Narendra, and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Zuckerberg began working on a project called The Harvard Connection, a sort of dating site for the Harvard elite. Zuckerberg later dropped out and began working on his own site with friends Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Eduardo Saverin. This site, which started as thefacebook.com, allowed users to create their own profiles, upload photos, and network with users at specific universities. Run out of a dorm room at Harvard until June 2004, thefacebook.com thrived, and Zuckerberg dropped out to pursue it full time. By the end of 2004, Facebook boasted 1 million users.
	The site began to evolve. At first, it was only available to certain schools. Thanks to investments from venture capital firms, the site eventually opened up to other schools, then to the general public. Early on, Zuckerberg was turning down offers from Yahoo! and MTV Networks.
	"The thing that we are trying to do at Facebook is just help people connect and communicate more efficiently," he said. Instead of taking lucrative offers (Yahoo! reportedly offered Zuckerberg $1 billion), Zuckerberg focused on expanding the site to bring as much value to users as possible. But legal troubles from his early dealings with The Harvard Connection plagued him, as depicted in the Academy Award-nominated movie "The Social Network."
	Zuckerberg later noted that much of the story was exaggerated for Hollywood. "I just think people have a lot of fiction," he said. "But the real story of Facebook is just that we've worked so hard for all this time. The real story is actually probably pretty boring, right? We just sat at our computers for six years and coded." Despite some of the negative depictions in the movie and the lawsuit filed by the Winklevoss twins, Zuckerberg and Facebook continued to thrive. He was named Time magazine's Person of the Year in 2010, and Forbes has ranked him at No. 36 on its 400 list, estimating his net worth at $13.3 billion as of March 2013.
	Taking risks is one of the secrets to Zuckerberg's success, he says; risks that include dropping out of Harvard and forging forward with the Facebook strategy. "The biggest risk is not taking any risk," he said. "In a world that's changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.
	With Zuckerberg's leadership, Facebook began to acquire smaller companies in the mobile technology space, including Friend.ly, Snaptu, and Instagram. Facebook continued to evolve, with its News Feed, photo posting capabilities, and information sharing features. The company found itself as part of odd news more than once, including numerous people who found long-lost relatives, a fugitive arrested after taunting police with photos and posts,  and woman who found the people who saved her as a baby.
	While Zuckerberg may not have foreseen consequences like this, he saw the potential for Facebook to help people develop their own identities. "Think about what people are doing on Facebook today," he said. "They're keeping up with their friends and family, but they're also building an image and identity for themselves, which in a sense is their brand. They're connecting with the audience that they want to connect to."
	In May 2012, Facebook had its initial public offering, raising $16 billion and becoming the biggest Internet IPO in history. Though plagued by several problems and heavily criticized for being overvalued, the IPO was the icing on the cake that was Zuckerberg's success at such a young age — he was only 28 at the time. But while young, he was not impulsive when it came to business decisions.
	Though part of Zuckerberg's entrepreneurial strategy is to take risks, he also emphasizes not blindly committing to something. "I have this fear of getting locked into doing things that are not the most impactful things you can do," he said. Zuckerberg's attitude and strategy is built on remaining flexible and nimble in approaching business matters. The CEO of a company acquired by Facebook noted that he met with Zuckerberg on a Friday afternoon, the papers were signed on Sunday, and the deal was announced on Monday.
	Though extremely wealthy at a young age, Zuckerberg has managed to stay humble. He married his college sweetheart, Priscilla Chan, in an unassuming and small surprise ceremony in his back yard the day after the Facebook IPO. Friends believed they were arriving at the house to celebrate Chan's graduation from medical school, and were thrilled to instead celebrate an exchange of vows. Sushi and Mexican food were served, while Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong performed to the 100 party guests.
	Wearing in his signature casual T-shirt and jeans on a daily basis, even in major business meetings, Zuckerberg inspires his employees to keep the office environment casual yet productive. He also was inspired by his wife, a pediatrician, to use Facebook to promote organ donations. Despite what others might do in her situation (being married to one of the richest people in America), she has remained self-sufficient and dedicated to her career, while avoiding the limelight as much as possible.
	Using his fortune, he became a widely regarded philanthropist. Zuckerberg donated 18 million Facebook shares to education initiatives, worth nearly $500 million, and donated $100 million to save the failing Newark Public Schools system. Joining Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and George Lucas, Zuckerberg signed "The Giving Pledge" and promised to donate at least 50 percent of his wealth to charity over the course of his lifetime. He encouraged other young entrepreneurs to do the same with their wealth.
	"With a generation of younger folks who have thrived on the success of their companies, there is a big opportunity for many of us to give back earlier in our lifetime and see the impact of our philanthropic efforts," he said.
	"Our mission is to make the world more open and connected. We do this by giving people the power to share whatever they want and be connected to whoever they want, no matter where they are."
	"We don’t build services to make money; we make money to build better services. And we think this is a good way to build something."
	"When people are writing nice stuff about us, it's important to get in front of the company and say, 'Don't believe all this.' When they write negative stuff, it's important to get in front of the company and say, 'Don't believe all this.'"
	"I mean, I wear the same thing every day, right? I mean, it's literally, if you could see my closet..."

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Mark Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984 in Dobbs Ferry, New York, USA as Mark Elliot Zuckerberg. He is an executive. He has been married to Priscilla Chan since May 19, 2012.
      Zuckerberg made a $100-million donation to the Newark (New Jersey) school system when he appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show: Episode dated 24 September 2010 (2010). Both New Jersey governor Chris Christie and Newark mayor Cory Booker were present during the announcement.
      After only 8 years in business, Zuckerberg's "Facebook" company declared that it has amassed a reported billion "friends" around the world.
      Think about what people are doing on Facebook today. They're keeping up with their friends and family, but they're also building an image and identity for themselves, which in a sense is their brand. They're connecting with the audience that they want to connect to. It's almost a disadvantage if you're not on it now.
      I just think people have a lot of fiction. But, you know, I mean, the real story of Facebook is just that we've worked so hard for all this time. I mean, the real story is actually probably pretty boring, right? I mean, we just sat at our computers for six years and coded.
      The biggest risk is not taking any risk... In a world that's changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.
      A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.
      All of my friends who have younger siblings who are going to college or high school - my number one piece of advice is: You should learn how to program.
      Facebook is really about communicating and telling stories... We think that people can really help spread awareness of organ donation and that they want to participate in this to their friends. And that can be a big part of helping solve the crisis that's out there.
      I mean, we've built a lot of products that we think are good, and will help people share photos and share videos and write messages to each other. But it's really all about how people are spreading Facebook around the world in all these different countries. And that's what's so amazing about the scale that it's at today.
      I think that people just have this core desire to express who they are. And I think that's always existed.
      I think a simple rule of business is, if you do the things that are easier first, then you can actually make a lot of progress.
      The thing that we are trying to do at Facebook, is just help people connect and communicate more efficiently.
      At Facebook, we build tools to help people connect with the people they want and share what they want, and by doing this we are extending people's capacity to build and maintain relationships.
      For the first time we're allowing developers who don't work at Facebook to develop applications just as if they were. That's a big deal because it means that all developers have a new way of doing business if they choose to take advantage of it. There are whole companies that are forming whose only product is a Facebook Platform application.
      The question isn't, 'What do we want to know about people?', It's, 'What do people want to tell about themselves?'
      I don't have an alarm clock. If someone needs to wake me up, then I have my BlackBerry next to me.
      The basis of our partnership strategy and our partnership approach: We build the social technology. They provide the music.
      This is our commitment to users and the people who use our service, is that Facebook's a free service. It's free now. It will always be free. We make money through having advertisements and things like that.
      Right now, with social networks and other tools on the Internet, all of these 500 million people have a way to say what they're thinking and have their voice be heard.
      I look at Google and think they have a strong academic culture. Elegant solutions to complex problems.
      We want Facebook to be one of the best places people can go to learn how to build stuff. If you want to build a company, nothing better than jumping in and trying to build one. But Facebook is also great for entrepreneurs/hackers. If people want to come for a few years and move on and build something great, that's something we're proud of.
      Facebook was not originally created to be a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission - to make the world more open and connected.
      The real story of Facebook is just that we've worked so hard for all this time. I mean, the real story is actually probably pretty boring, right? I mean, we just sat at our computers for six years and coded.
      I updated my grilling app, iGrill, today and it now has Facebook integration that lets you see what other people are grilling right now around the world. Awesome.
      The real question for me is, do people have the tools that they need in order to make those decisions well? And I think that it's actually really important that Facebook continually makes it easier and easier to make those decisions... If people feel like they don't have control over how they're sharing things, then we're failing them.
      There are people who are really good managers, people who can manage a big organization, and then there are people who are very analytic or focused on strategy. Those two types don't usually tend to be in the same person. I would put myself much more in the latter camp.
      I literally coded Facebook in my dorm room and launched it from my dorm room. I rented a server for $85 a month, and I funded it by putting an ad on the side, and we've funded ever since by putting ads on the side.
      Advertising works most effectively when it's in line with what people are already trying to do. And people are trying to communicate in a certain way on Facebook - they share information with their friends, they learn about what their friends are doing - so there's really a whole new opportunity for a new type of advertising model within that.
      When you give everyone a voice and give people power, the system usually ends up in a really good place. So, what we view our role as, is giving people that power.
      There are a few other things that I built when I was at Harvard that were kind of smaller versions of Facebook. One such program was this program called Match. People could enter the different courses that they were taking, and see what other courses would be correlated with the courses they are taking.
      My goal was never to just create a company. A lot of people misinterpret that, as if I don't care about revenue or profit or any of those things. But what not being just a company means to me is not being just that - building something that actually makes a really big change in the world.
      The companies that work are the ones that people really care about and have a vision for the world so do something you like.
      I got my first computer in the 6th grade or so. As soon as I got it, I was interested in finding out how it worked and how the programs worked and then figuring out how to write programs at just deeper and deeper levels within the system.
      I actually do think you're seeing this trend towards organizations just caring more about their brand and engaging. And so I think Home Depot will want to humanize itself. I think that's a lot of why companies are starting blogs, are just giving more insight into what's going on with them.
      Games is probably the biggest industry today that has gone really social, right. I mean, the incumbent game companies are really being disrupted and are quickly trying to become social. And you have companies like Zynga.
      Facebook is uniquely positioned to answer questions that people have, like, what sushi restaurants have my friends gone to in New York lately and liked? These are queries you could potentially do with Facebook that you couldn't do with anything else, we just have to do it.
      Facebook is inherently viral. There are lots of sites that include a contact importer, and for lots of them it doesn't really make sense. For Facebook it fits so well. It wasn't until a few years in that we started building some tools that made it easier to import friends to the site. That was a huge thing that spiked growth.
      Back, you know, a few generations ago, people didn't have a way to share information and express their opinions efficiently to a lot of people. But now they do. Right now, with social networks and other tools on the Internet, all of these 500 million people have a way to say what they're thinking and have their voice be heard.
      People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people - and that social norm is just something that has evolved over time.
      On engagement, we're already seeing that mobile users are more likely to be daily active users than desktop users. They're more likely to use Facebook six or seven days of the week.
      My friends are people who like building cool stuff. We always have this joke about people who want to just start companies without making something valuable. There's a lot of that in Silicon Valley.
      Look at the way celebrities and politicians are using Facebook already. When Ashton Kutcher posts a video, he gets hundreds of pieces of feedback. Maybe he doesn't have time to read them all or respond to them all, but he's getting good feedback and getting a good sense of how people are thinking about that and maybe can respond to some of it.
      It used to be the case, like you'd switch jobs, and then maybe you wouldn't keep in touch with all the people that you knew from that old job, just because it was too hard. But one of the things that Facebook does is it makes it really easy to just stay in touch with all these people.
      In terms of doing work and in terms of learning and evolving as a person, you just grow more when you get more people's perspectives... I really try and live the mission of the company and... keep everything else in my life extremely simple.
      In addition to building better products, a more open world will also encourage businesses to engage with their customers directly and authentically. More than four million businesses have Pages on Facebook that they use to have a dialogue with their customers. We expect this trend to grow as well.
      I think that more flow of information, the ability to stay connected to more people makes people more effective as people. And I mean, that's true socially. It makes you have more fun, right. It feels better to be more connected to all these people. You have a richer life.
      I hope that Facebook and other Internet technologies were able to help people, just like we hope that we help them communicate and organize and do whatever they want to every single day, but I don't pretend that if Facebook didn't exist, that this wouldn't even be possible. Of course, it would have.
      When I was in college I did a lot of stupid things and I don't want to make an excuse for that. Some of the things that people accuse me of are true, some of them aren't. There are pranks, IMs.
      This is a perverse thing, personally, but I would rather be in the cycle where people are underestimating us. It gives us latitude to go out and make big bets that excite and amaze people.
      There is a huge need and a huge opportunity to get everyone in the world connected, to give everyone a voice and to help transform society for the future. The scale of the technology and infrastructure that must be built is unprecedented, and we believe this is the most important problem we can focus on.
      People don't care about what someone says about you in a movie - or even what you say, right? They care about what you build. And if you can make something that makes people's life better, then that's something that's really good.
      No one has done a study on this, as far as I can tell, but I think Facebook might be the first place where a large number of people have come out. We didn't create that - society was generally ready for that. I think this is just part of the general trend that we talked about, about society being more open, and I think that's good.
