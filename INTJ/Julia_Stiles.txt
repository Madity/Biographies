Julia O'Hara Stiles (born March 28, 1981) is an American actress. She first gained prominence for her lead roles in teen films such as 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), Down to You (2000) and Save the Last Dance (2001). Her career progressed to starring in films such as The Business of Strangers (2001), Mona Lisa Smile (2003) and The Omen (2006). She also played the supporting character Nicky Parsons in the Bourne film series (2002–2007).
She guest starred as Lumen Pierce in the fifth season of the Showtime series Dexter (2010), a role that earned her Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. Most recently, Stiles had a supporting role in Silver Linings Playbook (2012), and also appears in Blue, a web series from WIGS (2012–present).
Stiles was born in New York City,[1] the eldest of three children. Her mother, Judith Newcomb Stiles, is a potter, and her father, John O'Hara, is a businessman.[2] Stiles is of English, Irish, and German descent.[3] She started acting at the age of eleven, performing with New York's La MaMa Theatre Company.[4]
Stiles's first film role was in I Love You, I Love You Not (1996), with Claire Danes and Jude Law.[5] She also had small roles as Harrison Ford's character's daughter in Alan J. Pakula's The Devil's Own (1997) and in M. Night Shyamalan's Wide Awake (1998). Her first lead was in Wicked (1998), playing a teenage girl who might have murdered her mother so she could have her father all to herself. Critic Joe Balthai wrote she was "the darling of the 1998 Sundance Film Festival."[6]
In 1999, she portrayed Kat Stratford, opposite Heath Ledger, in Gil Junger's 10 Things I Hate About You, an adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew set in a high school in Tacoma, Washington. She won an MTV Movie Award for Breakthrough Female Performance for the role. The Chicago Film Critics voted her the most promising new actress of the year. Her next starring role was in Down to You (2000), which was panned by critics, but earned her and her co-star Freddie Prinze, Jr. a Teen Choice Award nomination for their on-screen chemistry. She subsequently appeared in two more Shakespearean adaptations. The first was as Ophelia in Michael Almereyda's Hamlet (2000), with Ethan Hawke in the lead. The second was in the Desdemona role, opposite Mekhi Phifer, in Tim Blake Nelson's O (2001), a version of Othello set at a boarding school. Neither film was a great success; O was subject to many delays and a change of distributors, and Hamlet was an art house film shot on a minimal budget.
Stiles's next commercial success was in Save the Last Dance (2001) as an aspiring ballerina forced to leave her small town in downstate Illinois to live with her struggling musician father in Chicago after her mother dies in a car accident. At her new, nearly all-black school, she falls in love with the character played by Sean Patrick Thomas, who teaches her hip-hop dance steps that get her into The Juilliard School. The role won her two more MTV awards for Best Kiss and Best Female Performance, and a Teen Choice Award for best fight scene for her battle with Bianca Lawson. Rolling Stone pronounced her "the coolest co-ed," putting her on the cover of its April 12, 2001 issue.[7] She told Rolling Stone that she performed all her own dancing in the film, though the way the film was shot and edited might have made it appear otherwise.[7]
In David Mamet's State and Main (2000), about a film shooting on location in a small town in Vermont, she played a teenage girl who seduces a film actor (Alec Baldwin) with a weakness for teen girls. Stiles also appeared opposite Stockard Channing in the dark art house film The Business of Strangers (2001) as a conniving, amoral secretary who exacts revenge on her boss. Channing was impressed by her co-star: "In addition to her talent, she has a quality that is almost feral, something that can make people uneasy. She has an effect on people."[8] Stiles also had a small but crucial role as Treadstone operative Nicolette "Nicky" Parsons in The Bourne Identity (2002), a role that was enlarged in The Bourne Supremacy (2004), then greatly expanded in The Bourne Ultimatum (2007).
Between the Bourne films, she appeared in Mona Lisa Smile (2003) as Joan, a student at Wellesley College in 1953, whose art professor (Julia Roberts) encourages her to pursue a career in law rather than become a wife and mother. Critic Stephen Holden referred to her as one of cinema's "brightest young stars,"[9] but the film met with generally unfavorable reviews. Stiles played a Wisconsin college student who is swept off her feet by a Danish prince in The Prince and Me (2004), directed by Martha Coolidge. Stiles told an interviewer that she was very similar to the character, Paige Morgan. Critic Scott Foundas said while she was, as always, "irrepressibly engaging," the film was a "strange career choice for Stiles."[10] This echoed criticism in reviews of A Guy Thing (2003), a romantic comedy with Jason Lee and Selma Blair. Critic Dennis Harvey wrote that Stiles was "wasted,"[11] and Stephen Holden called her "a serious actress from whom comedy does not seem to flow naturally".[12] In 2005, Stiles was cast opposite her Hamlet co-star Liev Schreiber in The Omen, a remake of the 1976 horror film. The film was released on June 6, 2006.[13] She returned to the Bourne series with a much larger role in The Bourne Ultimatum in 2007, which is her highest grossing film to date.
Stiles began filming Between Us in May 2011 with co-stars Taye Diggs, David Harbour and Melissa George. Between Us is the screen adaptation of the off-Broadway play by the same name written by playwright Joe Hortua.[14]
In 2012, Stiles starred alongside David Cross and America Ferrera in the dark comedy It's a Disaster.[15] The film premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival and was picked up by Oscilloscope Laboratories and received a commercial release in April 2013.
Stiles had a small but pivotal role as a reporter in the 2013 British-American film Closed Circuit. In April 2013, it was announced that Stiles will be starring in an indie supernatural thriller Out of the Dark alongside Scott Speedman and Stephen Rea. Filming began in Bogotá, Colombia.[16]
Stiles's first theatrical roles were in works by author/composer John Moran with the group Ridge Theater, in Manhattan's Lower East Side from 1993–1998. From July to August 2002, she performed on stage in Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues,[17] and appeared as Viola, the lead role in Shakespeare in the Park's production of Twelfth Night with Jimmy Smits.[18]
In the spring of 2004, she made her London stage debut opposite Aaron Eckhart in a revival of David Mamet's play Oleanna at the Garrick Theatre.[19][20] She reprised the role of Carol in a 2009 production of Oleanna, directed by Doug Hughes and co-starring Bill Pullman at the Mark Taper Forum.[21] The production moved to Broadway's John Golden Theatre for October 11 opening night.[22]
Stiles was to play Jeannie in a production of Neil LaBute's Fat Pig directed by the playwright beginning in April 2011,[23] but it has been postponed indefinitely.[24]
Stiles appeared in the video for Cyndi Lauper's single, "Sally's Pigeons", in 1993.[25] On March 17, 2001, Stiles hosted Saturday Night Live and, eight days later, she was a presenter at the 73rd Academy Awards.[26] She returned to Saturday Night Live on 5 May, appearing as then-President George W. Bush's daughter Jenna Bush in a skit that poked fun at the two first daughters for being arrested for underage drinking.[2] MTV profiled her in its Diary series in 2003,[27] and she was Punk'd by Ashton Kutcher at a Washington, D.C. museum in the spring of 2004.[28]
Stiles made her writing and directorial debut with Elle magazine's short Raving starring Zooey Deschanel.[29] It premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival.[30]
In May 2010, Stiles was cast in a major role in the Showtime series Dexter[31][32][33] and signed for 10 episodes.[34] For this role, Stiles received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film.[35] as well as a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.
In June 2012, the web series Blue, produced by WIGS, premiered. It stars Stiles as a single mother with a 13-year-old son. She works at an office and also as a call girl in order to make ends meet on an otherwise meager income, and must fight to protect her son from the collision between her complicated past and tenuous present.[36]
Stiles graduated from Columbia University with a degree in English literature.[37] In 2010, she received a John Jay Award, an annual honorary award given to five alumni by the Columbia College Alumni Association for professional achievements.[38]
Stiles has also worked for Habitat for Humanity, building housing in Costa Rica,[39] and has worked with Amnesty International to raise awareness of the harsh conditions of immigration detention of unaccompanied juveniles. In January 2004, Marie Claire featured Stiles's trip to see conditions at the Berks County Youth Center in Leesport, Pennsylvania.[40][41]
She is an ex-vegan, occasionally eating red meat.[42] She says she gave up veganism after she developed anemia and found it difficult to get proper nutrition while traveling.[42] Stiles has described herself as a feminist and wrote on the subject in The Guardian.[20]
She loves baseball and is an avid fan of the New York Mets.[43] She threw the ceremonial first pitch before their May 29, 2006 game.[44] She is also a soccer fan and supports the New York Red Bulls.[45]
Stiles has previously been romantically linked to artist Jonathan Kramer (not to be confused with composer and musical theorist Jonathan Kramer).[46]
Nominated—Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film (2010)

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Julia O'Hara Stiles was born on March 28, 1981 in New York City, the outgoing daughter of an elementary school teacher father and a Greenwich Village artist mother, and the eldest of three children. Encouraged to take modern dance lessons at an early age, she was introduced to Shakespeare and theater. At age 11, she made her debut as a child actress with the experimental off-Broadway La MaMa Theatre. Her passion grew and by the next year was performing professionally and working in commercials. A bright, precocious student, she was seriously considered for the child vampire role of Claudia in Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994) but lost out in the end to Kirsten Dunst. She continued training at New York's Professional Children's School and, at 15, made her cinematic bow with I Love You, I Love You Not (1996) with Claire Danes. Next featured as the daughter of Harrison Ford in The Devil's Own (1997), her breakout role came on TV with the hard-hitting mini-movie Before Women Had Wings (1997), which was produced by Oprah Winfrey and dealt with child abuse. Her wish to play Shakespeare was granted threefold with her participation in 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), which was based on the Bard's "The Taming of The Shrew" and won her the Chicago Film Critics Award as the volatile teen Kat; an updated version of Hamlet (2000) which paired her Ophelia with Ethan Hawke; and another updated version of "Othello" entitled O (2001), which had her high school character of Desi (Desdemona) involved in a mixed romantic relationship with African-American Mekhi Phifer. The violent-edged film was made in 1998 but not released until three years later due to the tragic Colorado student shootings at Columbine High School. In addition, Julia later portrayed Viola off-Broadway in a Shakespeare-in-the-Park production of "Twelfth Night" in 2002. She temporarily interrupted her career after deciding to enroll at Columbia University in 2000, where she earned a degree in English. Stiles has also returned to the stage, appearing in David Mamet's "Oleanna" in London, a role she would reprise on Broadway in 2009, opposite Bill Pullman and directed by Doug Hughes.    Moving into mainstream roles by the millennium, she took on a role that would carry her through the decade, co-starring with Matt Damon in popular Bourne series: The Bourne Identity (2002), The Bourne Supremacy (2004), and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). During the time between Bourne films, she appeared in ensemble dramas, appearing opposite Julia Roberts in Mona Lisa Smile (2003), won offbeat notice in the title role of Carolina (2003) with Shirley MacLaine and Randy Quaid. She also returned to her indie film roots, with films such as Between Us (2012) and the comedy farce, It's a Disaster (2012).In 2010, she switched gears and headed to series television, joining the cast of Dexter (2006) for the show's fifth season in the role of Lumen Pierce, a performance that earned her nominations for both the Golden Globe and the Emmy for Best Supporting Actress. In 2012, she followed up with another series, Blue (2012), which airs on YouTube, while preparing for cinematic roles in Silver Linings Playbook (2012) and The Bell Jar.
      Has been in two films inspired by Shakespeare plays: 10 Things I Hate About You (1999) (The Taming of The Shrew), O (2001) (Othello), and one Shakespeare remake, Hamlet (2000) (Hamlet).
      In 1999, Julia graduated from New York's Professional Children's School, which prepares students for careers in the arts.
      During her hiatus from Save the Last Dance (2001), she signed up with Habitat for Humanity International, an organization that builds homes for the needy.
      No longer a vegan and when Conan O'Brien asked her what the first bite of a hamburger was like she responded, "The word orgasm comes to mind." (December 2003).
      After a 39-minute rain delay and dressed with a Mets cap, Julia Stiles threw out the opening pitch at Shea Stadium during the Memorial Day game of the New York Mets vs. Arizona Diamondbacks on May 29, 2006.
      She and Liev Schreiber played siblings in Hamlet (2000). The pair later played husband and wife in The Omen (2006).
      In 10 Things I Hate About You (1999) her character, Kat Stratford, was reading the book "The Bell Jar" in a scene. Stiles was attached to the lead role in the movie version of the novel for some years.
      Has appeared in two movies where Sylvia Plath's novel "The Bell Jar" is mentioned (10 Things I Hate About You (1999) and Silver Linings Playbook (2012)).

      I am a big fan of horror movies but I had never thought that I had wanted to act in one because I don't think that actors get to do much in them. They're usually just reacting.
      I was gonna throw the first pitch at a Mets game, but there was a rain delay. So I'm waiting for it to stop, and the team's manager, Willie Randolph, comes by. Now he's already intimidating to begin with. But he comes over to me and says, 'If you screw this up, they will boo you.' And I said 'Thanks.'
      I think audiences, producers and directors included, develop crushes on actors (actresses in particular) and then lose interest and move on to the next one. [...] There are a handful of actors who sustain interest because it's exciting to watch them get better at what they do. I want to be one of those actors.
      [on the most challenging aspect of playing "Lumen" in "Dexter"] - I never think of myself as an actor who takes work home with them, but I was surprised, especially toward the end of the season -- around episode 10 -- when some of the details of what Lumen had experienced became really harrowing, and I started to realize that it was affecting me outside of work. One scene in particular, in episode 10, when the detectives have found DVDs showing what has happened to the victims -- it was really dark. It made it more difficult for me to sleep.
      [on a scene that stands out most when looking back on her time on "Dexter"] In the kill room, when she first gets to put the knife in. That was really special. There was also a nice moment of collaboration where the set designers had put up pictures of all the other victims on the wall, and I remember saying to the director that I felt like it was important that Lumen acknowledge the other girls and say that it was for them, too. We did a separate shot of that, and it ended up in the final edit, which I was really pleased about. It's a great example of how collaborative the show is and what a nice environment it is to work in.

When Dexter kicks off its final season (Sunday, June 30 at 9/8c on Showtime), expect a huge shift in the relationships we've come to know and love over the years. Sure, Deb (Jennifer Carpenter) and Dexter (Michael C. Hall) hit a rough patch last year after she discovered her foster brother is a serial killer, but they will hit their rockiest road yet in the wake of LaGuerta's (Lauren Velez) death.
Dexter's foul-mouthed lieutenant took a very dark turn on Sunday's finale, shooting her long-time frenemy LaGuerta (Lauren Velez) in order to protect her brother Dexter (Michael C. Hall). So what does this mean for Deb (Jennifer Carpenter)? TVGuide.com turned to showrunner Scott Buck to get the scoop on whether the Morgan siblings will be able to cover up this murder and so much more! Plus: Is Season 8 really Dexter's last? Read below!
Every season of Dexter has been about its titular serial killer trying really hard to keep his secret. This year, however, it's his sister Deb who has a secret: Not only does she love her brother, but she's in love with him. (As she said, he's the serial killer, and she's more messed-up!) Well, that secret is finally out, so now what comes next?
One of this fall's big programming events wasn't actually broadcast on TV. Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn, a live-action series geared toward the launch of the new Xbox 360 video game, has become a hit for YouTube, where it runs on the young male-oriented Machinima Prime channel.
YouTube is taking on the traditional TV model in a big way, with the help of major stars, original programs like Halo 4 and big events like Felix Baumgartner's space jump, which broke YouTube user records on Oct. 14. A year after YouTube parent Google unleashed an aggressive $100 million initiative to launch around 100 original programming channels (and committed $200 million to market the channels), viewership on the platform was up 11 percent year-to-year in September.
It's a slow build, and so far YouTube's original programming initiative hasn't produced a hit that was big enough to enter the public consciousness. But according to newly released comScore data, YouTube users spent an average of 419.1 minutes watching video in September, compared to 378 minutes in Sept. 2011.

With a number of high-profile projects, a variety of magazine covers, and a spot on Teen People's 21 Hottest Stars Under 21 list in 1999 under her belt, actress Julia Stiles has come a remarkably long way in a very short time.  Born March 28, 1981, in New York City, Stiles was interested in performing from a very young age. When she was eleven years old, she wrote a letter to a Manhattan theater director asking to be cast in a production and was soon acting on-stage in avant-garde plays at both the La Mama and Kitchen Theaters. In 1996, Stiles made her film debut with a small part in I Love You, I Love You Not and the following year had her television debut in the Oprah Winfrey Presents: Before Women Had Wings, in which she played an abused child. The same year, she made a brief appearance as Harrison Ford's daughter in The Devil's Own and followed with roles in two 1998 films, Wide Awake and the Sundance entry Wicked.  The year 1999 proved to be Stiles' breakthrough year, as she played a prominent part in the television miniseries The '60s and the lead role in 10 Things I Hate About You, the latest film to mine gold and produce endorsements out of William Shakespeare. The film was a hit, and Stiles was soon being heralded as one of the hottest, young actors of her generation. With her name attached to a number of future projects, it seemed that Stiles would indeed have success in living up to this label. Sure enough, Stiles was almost immediately cast in two modernized-for-MTV-generation Shakespeare flicks, namely director Michael Almereyda's Hamlet (2000) with Ethan Hawke and O, a teen-oriented adaptation of Othello starring Josh Hartnett and Mekhi Phifer. As classic literature once again fell in place behind predictable romantic comedies, Stiles could be found playing the romantic lead in Down to You with teen movie veteran Freddie Prinze Jr., and alongside Sean Patrick Thomas in Save the Last Dance, which featured Stiles in the role of a grieving ballet dancer who attends an inner-city school and eventually finds love within a primarily black high school. Though the film was not a critical success, Save the Last Dance (2001) and 10 Things I Hate About You nonetheless helped construct Stiles a respectable fan base, and the young actress -- now with a Saturday Night Live credit under her belt -- would continue to build her resumé throughout the early 2000s.  In the film adaptation of novelist Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Identity, Stiles had the chance to participate in a film starring Hollywood golden boy Matt Damon and returned to the role in 2004's The Bourne Supremacy. Stiles was praised for holding her own against Stockard Channing in The Business of Strangers (2001), which was shown at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival and fared decently in A Guy Thing, a romantic comedy-of-errors co-starring Jason Lee and Stiles' fellow Down to You alumna Selma Blair. In 2003, Stiles would play opposite the Oscar-winning Julia Roberts in Mona Lisa Smile, which finds Stiles playing a conservative '50s college student whose beliefs undergo some serious scrutiny after coming in contact with an uncharacteristically progressive teacher (Roberts).  The year 2004 promised more teen-styled roles; Stiles played the eccentric title character in Carolina under the direction of Dutch filmmaker Marleen Gorris and worked with director Martha Coolidge and 28 Days Later's Luke Mably in The Prince & Me. A key role in opposite William H. Macy in director Stuard Gordon's critically lauded but little seen David Mamet adaptation Edmond served well to remind audiences of Stiles acting abilities, and the following year the wholesome-looking beauty would serve as mother to the ultimate evil in the high profile horror remake The Omen. Jumping genres to action with The Bourne Ultimatum the following year, Stiles quickly ventured back into dark territory when she joined the cast of the popular Showtime series Dexter in late 2010. Cast as vengeful rape victim Lumen Ann Pierce, the versatile young actress proved an unlikely partner for the murderous protagonist, and earned an Emmy nomination for her role in the process. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi
