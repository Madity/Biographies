I am often asked whether I am primarily a novelist or a philosopher. The answer is: both. In a certain sense, every novelist is a philosopher, because one cannot present a picture of human existence without a philosophical framework. . . . In order to define, explain and present my concept of man, I had to become a philosopher in the specific meaning of the term.
Howard Roark. John Galt. Dagny Taggart. Hank Rearden. The heroes of The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged are famous because they're unique. Rand's stories, full of drama and intrigue, portray businessmen, inventors, architects, workers and scientists as noble, passionate figures. Where else will you find an inventor who must rediscover the word “I,” a young woman who defies a nation embracing communism, or an industrialist who must disguise himself as a playboy? A philosopher-pirate? An architect who is fiercely selfish yet enormously benevolent? A man who vows to stop the motor of the world — and does?
In creating her novels, Rand sought to make real her exalted view of man and of life — “like a beacon,” she wrote, “raised over the dark crossroads of the world, saying ‘This is possible.’” For millions of readers, the experience of entering Rand's universe proves unforgettable.
My basic test for any story is: Would I want to meet these characters and observe these events in real life? Is this story an experience worth living through for its own sake? Is the pleasure of contemplating these characters an end in itself?
To create her unusual stories and characters, Rand had to define the new ideas and principles that guide her heroes. She had to create a new philosophy. “I am interested in philosophical principles,” she wrote, “only as they affect the actual existence of men; and in men, only as they reflect philosophical principles.”
For Rand, philosophy is not an esoteric subject but a daily force shaping individual lives and human history. You must have some view of the kind of world you live in, of how best to understand and deal with it, and of what to aim at in life. Your only choice is whether your philosophical premises are acquired by your own independent thinking or absorbed unquestioningly from those around you.
Formally, Rand called her philosophy “Objectivism,” but informally she called it “a philosophy for living on earth.”
In contrast to the idea that reality is a plaything of gods or that it varies from person to person, Objectivism holds that facts are facts, independent of anyone’s wishes or beliefs. Things are what they are — and act accordingly. Reality — nature — is absolute: “You can’t eat your cake and have it, too.”
In contrast to the idea that you can’t know anything for sure or must be guided by faith or instinct, Objectivism holds that you can achieve certainty, but only if you use reason. Reason — sense-perception, concepts, logic — is your only means to knowledge and your only guide to successful action.
In contrast to the idea that your life belongs to others (family, nation, God), whom you must obey and serve, Objectivism holds “that your life belongs to you and the good is to live it.” You deal with others not as master-servant but as fellow traders, trading value for value in matter and spirit.
In contrast to the idea that the state exists to promote the “public interest,” Objectivism holds that it exists to protect each individual’s rights. It should control neither ideas nor production: “a separation of state and economics, in the same way . . . as the separation of church and state.”
During her own lifetime, Rand became a famous and controversial figure. A best-selling author, she also carried her message to university classrooms, to Hollywood, to Congress, to the editorial page, to talk shows and radio programs. Her presence has only increased since her death in 1982, as her philosophy has become more well-known. Today, her books have sold in the millions, and she's the subject of an Oscar-nominated documentary, a U.S. postage stamp, university courses, and a philosophical society devoted to the study of her thought.
Fueled by her vision of man as a heroic being and by the original philosophy behind it, more and more people, from all walks of life, from businessmen to students to professors to athletes to artists, are saying the same thing: "Ayn Rand's writings changed my life."
“I did not know that I was predicting my own future when I described the process of Roark’s success: ‘It was as if an underground stream flowed through the country and broke out in sudden springs that shot to the surface at random, in unpredictable places.”

=======================================================
Ayn Rand (/ˈaɪn ˈrænd/;[1] born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum; February 2 [O.S. January 20] 1905 – March 6, 1982) was an American novelist, philosopher,[2] playwright, and screenwriter. She is known for her two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and for developing a philosophical system she called Objectivism. Born and educated in Russia, Rand moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935–1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful in America, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead.
In 1957, she published her best-known work, the novel Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982. Rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism, and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral[3] and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, instead supporting laissez-faire capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights.[4] In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for some Aristotelians and classical liberals.[5]
Literary critics received Rand's fiction with mixed reviews,[6] and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades.[7][8][9] The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings.[10] She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.[11]
Rand was born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum (Russian: Али́са Зиновьевна Розенбаум) on February 2, 1905, to a Russian Jewish bourgeois[12] family living in Saint Petersburg. She was the eldest of the three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum and his wife, Anna Borisovna (née Kaplan), largely non-observant Jews. Zinovy Rosenbaum was a successful pharmacist and businessman, eventually owning a pharmacy and the building in which it was located.[13] With a passion for the liberal arts, Rand found school unchallenging, and said she began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten.[14] At the prestigious Stoiunina Gymnasium, her closest friend was Vladimir Nabokov's younger sister, Olga. The two girls shared an intense interest in politics and would engage in debates: while Nabokov defended constitutional monarchy, Rand supported republican ideals.[15] She was twelve at the time of the February Revolution of 1917, during which she favored Alexander Kerensky over Tsar Nicholas II.
The subsequent October Revolution and the rule of the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin disrupted the comfortable life the family had previously enjoyed. Her father’s business was confiscated and the family displaced. They fled to the Crimean Peninsula, which was initially under control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War. She later recalled that, while in high school, she determined that she was an atheist and that she valued reason above any other human virtue. After graduating from high school in the Crimea at 16, Rand returned with her family to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg was renamed at that time), where they faced desperate conditions, on occasion nearly starving.[16][17]
After the Russian Revolution, universities were opened to women, allowing Rand to be in the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University,[18] where, at the age of only 16, she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy, majoring in history.[19] At the university she was introduced to the writings of Aristotle and Plato,[20] who would be her greatest influence and counter-influence, respectively.[21] A third figure whose philosophical works she studied heavily was Friedrich Nietzsche.[22] Able to read French, German and Russian, Rand also discovered the writers Fyodor Dostoevsky, Victor Hugo, Edmond Rostand, and Friedrich Schiller, who became her perennial favorites.[23]
Along with many other "bourgeois" students, Rand was purged from the university shortly before graduating. However, after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists, many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate,[24] which Rand did in October 1924.[25] She subsequently studied for a year at the State Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad. For one of her assignments, she wrote an essay about the Polish actress Pola Negri, which became her first published work.[26]
By this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be Rand,[27] possibly as a Cyrillic contraction of her birth surname,[28] and she adopted the first name Ayn, either from a Finnish name or from the Hebrew word עין (ayin, meaning "eye").[29]
Cover of Rand's first published work, a 2,500-word monograph on femme fatale Pola Negri published in 1925.[26]
In the fall of 1925, Rand was granted a visa to visit American relatives. She departed on January 17, 1926.[30] When she arrived in New York City on February 19, 1926, she was so impressed with the skyline of Manhattan that she cried what she later called "tears of splendor".[31] Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter, she lived for a few months with relatives in Chicago, one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free. She then set out for Hollywood, California.[32]
Initially, Rand struggled in Hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses. A chance meeting with famed director Cecil B. DeMille led to a job as an extra in his film The King of Kings as well as subsequent work as a junior screenwriter.[33] While working on The King of Kings, she met an aspiring young actor, Frank O'Connor; the two were married on April 15, 1929. Rand became an American citizen in 1931. Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing, she worked for a time as the head of the costume department at RKO Studios.[34] She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States, but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate.[35]
Rand's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay Red Pawn to Universal Studios in 1932, although it was never produced.[36] This was followed by the courtroom drama Night of January 16th, first produced by E.E. Clive in Hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on Broadway in 1935. Each night the "jury" was selected from members of the audience, and one of the two different endings, depending on the jury's "verdict", would then be performed.[37] In 1941, Paramount Pictures produced a movie loosely based on the play. Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result.[38]
Rand's first novel, the semi-autobiographical We the Living, was published in 1936. Set in Soviet Russia, it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state. In a 1959 foreword to the novel, Rand stated that We the Living "is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. It is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the intellectual sense. The plot is invented, the background is not..."[39] Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print,[40] although European editions continued to sell.[41] After the success of her later novels, Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies.[42] Without Rand's knowledge or permission, the novel was made into a pair of Italian films, Noi vivi and Addio, Kira, in 1942. Rediscovered in the 1960s, these films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as We the Living in 1986.[43]
Her novella Anthem was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel, The Fountainhead. It presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'.[44] It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with We the Living, Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.[45]
During the 1940s, Rand became politically active. Both she and her husband worked full-time in volunteer positions for the 1940 presidential campaign of Republican Wendell Willkie. This work led to Rand's first public speaking experiences, including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had just viewed pro-Willkie newsreels, an experience she greatly enjoyed.[46] This activity also brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism. She became friends with journalist Henry Hazlitt and his wife, and Hazlitt introduced her to the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises. Despite her philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career, and both of them expressed admiration for her. Once Mises referred to Rand as "the most courageous man in America", a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said "man" instead of "woman".[47] Rand also developed a friendship with libertarian writer Isabel Paterson. Rand questioned the well-informed Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book, The God of the Machine.[48]
Rand's first major success as a writer came with The Fountainhead in 1943, a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years.[49] The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as "second-handers"— those who attempt to live through others, placing others above themselves. It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the Bobbs-Merrill Company on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it.[50] While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed Benzedrine, a brand of amphetamine, to fight fatigue.[51] The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the finished novel, but when the book was done, she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest.[52] Her continued use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.[53]
The Fountainhead eventually became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security.[54] In 1943, Rand sold the rights for a film version to Warner Bros., and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay. Finishing her work on that screenplay, she was hired by producer Hal Wallis as a screenwriter and script-doctor. Her work for Wallis included the screenplays for the Oscar-nominated Love Letters and You Came Along.[55] This role gave Rand time to work on other projects, including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called The Moral Basis of Individualism. Although the planned book was never completed, a condensed version was published as an essay titled "The Only Path to Tomorrow", in the January 1944 edition of Reader's Digest magazine.[56]
Rand extended her involvement with free-market and anti-communist activism while working in Hollywood. She became involved with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a Hollywood anti-Communist group, and wrote articles on the group's behalf. She also joined the anti-Communist American Writers Association.[57] A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rand's California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments that Rand saw as rude to valued political allies.[58] In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Rand testified as a "friendly witness" before the United States House Un-American Activities Committee. Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the Soviet Union and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film Song of Russia.[59] Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union, portraying life there as being much better and happier than it actually was.[60] She wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film The Best Years of Our Lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world, but she was not allowed to testify about it.[61] When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations, Rand described the process as "futile".[62]
After several delays, the film version of The Fountainhead was released in 1949. Although it used Rand's screenplay with minimal alterations, she "disliked the movie from beginning to end", complaining about its editing, acting, and other elements.[63]
In the years following the publication of The Fountainhead, Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom it profoundly influenced. In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated "The Collective") included future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later Nathaniel Branden) and his wife Barbara, and Barbara's cousin Leonard Peikoff. At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy. Later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, Atlas Shrugged, as the manuscript pages were written. In 1954 Rand's close relationship with the younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.[64]
Atlas Shrugged, published in 1957, was considered Rand's magnum opus.[65] Rand described the theme of the novel as "the role of the mind in man's existence—and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest."[66] It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement. The plot involves a dystopian United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists and artists go on strike against an oppressive government that is a caricature of communism, and retreat to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy. The novel's hero and leader of the strike, John Galt, describes the strike as "stopping the motor of the world" by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation's wealth and achievement. With this fictional strike, Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive, the economy would collapse and society would fall apart. The novel includes elements of romance,[67][68] mystery, and science fiction,[69] and it contains Rand's most extensive statement of Objectivism in any of her works of fiction, a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt.
Despite many negative reviews, Atlas Shrugged became an international bestseller, and in an interview with Mike Wallace, Rand declared herself "the most creative thinker alive".[70] After completing the novel, Rand fell into a severe depression.[71] Atlas Shrugged was Rand's last completed work of fiction; a turning point in her life, it marked the end of Rand's career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher.[72]
In 1958 Nathaniel Branden established Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), to promote Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that she edited. Rand later published some of these articles in book form. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the Objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion.[73] Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers.[74] Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students[75] and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.[76] However, some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated, with the problem being concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York.[77]
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as Yale, Princeton, Columbia,[78] Harvard, and MIT.[79] She received an honorary doctorate from Lewis & Clark College in 1963.[80] She also began delivering annual lectures at the Ford Hall Forum, responding afterward to questions from the audience.[81] During these speeches and Q&A sessions, she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day. These included supporting abortion rights,[82] opposing the Vietnam War and the military draft (but condemning many draft dodgers as "bums"),[83] supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as "civilized men fighting savages",[84] saying European colonists had the right to take land from American Indians,[85] and calling homosexuality "immoral" and "disgusting", while also advocating the repeal of all laws about it.[86] She also endorsed several Republican candidates for President of the United States, most strongly Barry Goldwater in 1964, whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for The Objectivist Newsletter.[87]
In 1964 Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott, whom he later married. Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand. When she learned of it in 1968, though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended,[88] Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens, which led to the closure of NBI.[89] Rand published an article in The Objectivist repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other "irrational behavior in his private life".[90] Branden later apologized in an interview to "every student of Objectivism" for "perpetuating the Ayn Rand mystique" and for "contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the Objectivist movement."[91] In subsequent years, Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company.[92]
Rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking.[93] In 1976, she retired from writing her newsletter and, despite her initial objections, was persuaded to allow Evva Pryor, a consultant from her attorney's office, to sign her up for Social Security and Medicare.[94] During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined, especially after the death of her husband on November 9, 1979.[95] One of her final projects was work on a never-completed television adaptation of Atlas Shrugged.[96]
Rand died of heart failure on March 6, 1982, at her home in New York City,[97] and was interred in the Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, New York.[98] Rand's funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including Alan Greenspan. A six-foot floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket.[99] In her will, Rand named Leonard Peikoff the heir to her estate.[100]
Rand called her philosophy "Objectivism," describing its essence as "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute."[101] She considered Objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy and aesthetics.[102]
In metaphysics, Rand supported philosophical realism, and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism, including all forms of religion.[103] In epistemology, she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception, the validity of which she considered axiomatic,[104] and reason, which she described as "the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses."[105] She rejected all claims of non-perceptual or a priori knowledge, including "'instinct,' 'intuition,' 'revelation,' or any form of 'just knowing.'"[106] In her Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic–synthetic dichotomy.[107]
In ethics, Rand argued for rational and ethical egoism (rational self-interest), as the guiding moral principle. She said the individual should "exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself."[108] She referred to egoism as "the virtue of selfishness" in her book of that title,[109] in which she presented her solution to the is-ought problem by describing a meta-ethical theory that based morality in the needs of "man's survival qua man."[110] She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness,[111] and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational, writing in Atlas Shrugged that "Force and mind are opposites."[112]
Rand's political philosophy emphasized individual rights (including property rights),[113] and she considered laissez-faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights.[4] She opposed statism, which she understood to include theocracy, absolute monarchy, Nazism, fascism, communism, democratic socialism, and dictatorship.[114] Rand believed that rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government.[115] Although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian, she preferred the term "radical for capitalism." She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics.[116] She denounced libertarianism, which she associated with anarchism.[117] She rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice.[118]
Rand's aesthetics defined art as a "selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments." According to Rand, art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped, thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness.[119] As a writer, the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature, where she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will.[120] She described her own approach to literature as "romantic realism".[121]
Rand acknowledged Aristotle as her greatest influence[122] and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend "three A's" — Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand.[123] In a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace, when asked where her philosophy came from, she responded, "Out of my own mind, with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle, the only philosopher who ever influenced me. I devised the rest of my philosophy myself."[124] However, she also found early inspiration in Friedrich Nietzsche,[125] and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rand's journals,[126] in passages from the first edition of We the Living (which Rand later revised),[127] and in her overall writing style.[128] However, by the time she wrote The Fountainhead, Rand had turned against Nietzsche's ideas,[129] and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed.[130] Among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was Immanuel Kant, whom she referred to as a "monster,"[131] although philosophers George Walsh[132] and Fred Seddon[133] have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences.
Rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her "theory of concepts, [her] ethics, and [her] discovery in politics that evil—the violation of rights—consists of the initiation of force."[134] She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy,[135] stating, "I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am not primarily an advocate of egoism, but of reason. If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently, all the rest follows."[136]
During Rand's lifetime, her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation. Rand's first novel, We the Living, was admired by the literary critic H. L. Mencken,[137] her Broadway play Night of January 16th was both a critical and popular success,[138] and The Fountainhead was hailed by a reviewer in The New York Times as "masterful".[139] Rand's novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic.[6] However, they became bestsellers largely through word of mouth.[140]
The first reviews Rand received were for Night of January 16th. Reviews of the production were largely positive, but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer.[138] Rand believed that her first novel, We the Living, was not widely reviewed, but Rand scholar Michael S. Berliner says "it was the most reviewed of any of her works", with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications. Overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work.[141] Her 1938 novella Anthem received little attention from reviewers, both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re-issues.[142]
Rand's first bestseller, The Fountainhead, received far fewer reviews than We the Living, and reviewers' opinions were mixed.[143] There was a positive review in The New York Times that Rand greatly appreciated.[144] The reviewer called Rand "a writer of great power" who wrote "brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly", and stated that "you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time".[139] There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications.[143] Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel,[6] such as one that called it "a whale of a book" and another that said "anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing". Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style "offensively pedestrian".[143]
Rand's 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged was widely reviewed, and many of the reviews were strongly negative.[6][145] In the National Review, conservative author Whittaker Chambers called the book "sophomoric" and "remarkably silly". He described the tone of the book as "shrillness without reprieve" and accused Rand of supporting a godless system (which he related to that of the Soviets), claiming "From almost any page of Atlas Shrugged, a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: 'To a gas chamber—go!'"[146] Atlas Shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications, including praise from the noted book reviewer John Chamberlain,[145] but Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein later wrote that "reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put-downs", calling it "execrable claptrap" and "a nightmare"; they said it was "written out of hate" and showed "remorseless hectoring and prolixity".[6] Author Flannery O'Connor wrote in a letter to a friend that "The fiction of Ayn Rand is as low as you can get re fiction. I hope you picked it up off the floor of the subway and threw it in the nearest garbage pail."[147]
Rand's nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had. The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book, For the New Intellectual, was similar to that for Atlas Shrugged,[148][149] with philosopher Sidney Hook likening her certainty to "the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union",[150] and author Gore Vidal calling her viewpoint "nearly perfect in its immorality".[151] Her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers.[148]
On the 100th anniversary of Rand's birth in 2005, Edward Rothstein, writing for The New York Times, referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian "retro fantasy" and programmatic neo-Romanticism of the misunderstood artist, while criticizing her characters' "isolated rejection of democratic society".[152] In 2007, book critic Leslie Clark described her fiction as "romance novels with a patina of pseudo-philosophy".[153] In 2009, GQ's critic columnist Tom Carson described her books as "capitalism's version of middlebrow religious novels" such as Ben-Hur and the Left Behind series.[154]

In 1991, a survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the Book-of-the-Month Club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent's life was. Rand's Atlas Shrugged was the second most popular choice, after the Bible.[155] Rand's books continue to be widely sold and read, with over 29 million copies sold as of 2013 (with about 10% of that total purchased for free distribution to schools by the Ayn Rand Institute).[156] Although Rand's influence has been greatest in the United States, there has been international interest in her work.[7][157] Rand's work continues to be among the top sellers among books in India.[158]
Rand's contemporary admirers included fellow novelists, such as Ira Levin, Kay Nolte Smith and L. Neil Smith, and later writers such as Erika Holzer and Terry Goodkind have been influenced by her.[159] Other artists who have cited Rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist Steve Ditko[160] and musician Neil Peart of Rush.[161] Rand provided a positive view of business, and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work.[162] John Allison of BB&T and Ed Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rand's ideas,[163] while Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, and John P. Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods, among others, have said they consider Rand crucial to their success.[164]
Rand and her works have been referred to in a variety of media: on television shows including animated sitcoms, live-action comedies, dramas, and game shows,[165] as well as in movies and video games.[166] She, or characters based on her, figure prominently (in positive and negative lights) in literary and science fiction novels by prominent American authors.[167] Nick Gillespie, editor in chief of Reason, has remarked that "Rand's is a tortured immortality, one in which she's as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist..." and that "jibes at Rand as cold and inhuman, run through the popular culture".[168] Two movies have been made about Rand's life. A 1997 documentary film, Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life, was nominated for the Academy Award for Documentary Feature.[169] The Passion of Ayn Rand, a 1999 television adaptation of the book of the same name, won several awards.[170] Rand's image also appears on a U.S. postage stamp designed by artist Nick Gaetano.[171]
Although she rejected the labels "conservative" and "libertarian",[172] Rand has had continuing influence on right-wing politics and libertarianism.[11] Jim Powell, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, considers Rand one of the three most important women (along with Rose Wilder Lane and Isabel Paterson) of modern American libertarianism,[173] and David Nolan, one of the founders of the Libertarian Party, stated that "without Ayn Rand, the libertarian movement would not exist".[174] In his history of the libertarian movement, journalist Brian Doherty described her as "the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large",[155] and biographer Jennifer Burns referred to her as "the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right".[175]

She faced intense opposition from William F. Buckley, Jr. and other contributors for the National Review magazine. They published numerous criticisms in the 1950s and 1960s by Whittaker Chambers, Garry Wills, and M. Stanton Evans. Nevertheless, her influence among conservatives forced Buckley and other National Review contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and Christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism.[176]
The political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives (often members of the United States Republican Party),[177] despite Rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives, such as being pro-choice and an atheist.[178] A 1987 article in The New York Times referred to her as the Reagan administration's "novelist laureate".[179] Republican Congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and recommended her novels.[180]
The late-2000s financial crisis spurred renewed interest in her works, especially Atlas Shrugged, which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis,[181] and opinion articles compared real-world events with the plot of the novel.[182] During this time, signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero John Galt appeared at Tea Party protests.[183] There was also increased criticism of her ideas, especially from the political left, with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets, particularly through her influence on Alan Greenspan.[184] For example, Mother Jones remarked that "Rand's particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy, the talented, and the powerful as the oppressed",[178] while The Nation alleged similarities between the "moral syntax of Randianism" and fascism.[185]
During Rand's lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars.[10] When the first academic book about Rand's philosophy appeared in 1971, its author declared writing about Rand "a treacherous undertaking" that could lead to "guilt by association" for taking her seriously.[186] A few articles about Rand's ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982, many of them in The Personalist.[187] One of these was "On the Randian Argument" by libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick, who argued that her meta-ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the is–ought problem posed by David Hume.[188] Some responses to Nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in The Personalist arguing that Nozick misstated Rand's case.[187] Academic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited. Academic Mimi Gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about Rand's novels when she began researching her in 1973, and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s.[189]
Since Rand's death, interest in her work has gradually increased.[190] Historian Jennifer Burns has identified "three overlapping waves" of scholarly interest in Rand, the most recent of which is "an explosion of scholarship" since the year 2000.[191] However, few universities currently include Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area, with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study.[192]
Gladstein, Chris Matthew Sciabarra, Allan Gotthelf, Edwin A. Locke and Tara Smith have taught her work in academic institutions. Sciabarra co-edits the Journal of Ayn Rand Studies, a nonpartisan peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study of Rand's philosophical and literary work.[193] In 1987 Gotthelf helped found the Ayn Rand Society with George Walsh and David Kelley, and has been active in sponsoring seminars about Rand and her ideas.[194] Smith has written several academic books and papers on Rand's ideas, including Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist, a volume on Rand's ethical theory published by Cambridge University Press. Rand's ideas have also been made subjects of study at Clemson and Duke universities.[195] Scholars of English and American literature have largely ignored her work,[196] although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s.[197]
Rand scholars Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas B. Rasmussen, while stressing the importance and originality of her thought, describe her style as "literary, hyperbolic and emotional".[198] Philosopher Jack Wheeler says that despite "the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage", Rand's ethics are "a most immense achievement, the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought."[199] In the Literary Encyclopedia entry for Rand written in 2001, John David Lewis declared that "Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation".[200] In a 1999 interview in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Sciabarra commented, "I know they laugh at Rand", while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community.[201]
Libertarian philosopher Michael Huemer has argued that very few people find Rand's ideas convincing, especially her ethics,[202] which he believes is difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence.[203] He attributes the attention she receives to her being a "compelling writer", especially as a novelist. Thus, Atlas Shrugged outsells not only the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism such as Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, or Frederic Bastiat, but also Rand's own non-fiction works.[202]
Political scientist Charles Murray, while praising Rand's literary accomplishments, criticizes her claim that her only "philosophical debt" was to Aristotle, instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche. According to Murray, "By insisting that Objectivism had sprung full blown from her own mind, with just a little help from Aristotle, Rand was being childish, as well as out of touch with reality."[204]
Although Rand maintained that Objectivism was an integrated philosophical system, philosopher Robert H. Bass has argued that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas.[205]
In 1985, Rand's heir Leonard Peikoff established the Ayn Rand Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand's ideas and works. In 1990, philosopher David Kelley founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies, now known as The Atlas Society.[206] In 2001 historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia.[207] The charitable foundation of BB&T Corporation has also given grants for teaching Rand's ideas or works. The University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pittsburgh, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are among the schools that have received grants. In some cases these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to Rand.[208]

Ayn Rand was a woman of truly remarkable achievement. She was a phenomenally successful novelist whose books have sold millions of copies and profoundly affected countless lives. Through her fiction and her later essays and articles, she founded a whole new philosophy—a philosophy for living on earth. Her singular vision has inspired millions to take charge of their lives, and attracted its fair share of controversy, too.
Rand’s philosophy celebrates reason as our unique means of survival and our special glory; one’s own happiness as one’s highest goal; productive work as one’s noblest activity; and laissez-faire capitalism as the only moral system of government. Combined with her heroic vision of life’s possibilities and her sense of the universe as a benevolent place, it is little wonder that her philosophy and writings have such enduring appeal. 
 Rand’s own life was marked by drama worthy of inclusion in one of her breathtaking novels. Born Alissa Rosenbaum on February 2, 1905 in St. Petersburg, she witnessed the first shots of the Russian Revolution from her balcony when she was a mere 12 years old. Almost overnight, her family was reduced to crushing poverty as communists thugs nationalized her father’s chemist shop. Discovering the works of great romantic writers like Victor Hugo and Edmond Rostand helped the young girl expand her private vision of human potential, but the social horizons of human possibility were shrinking all around her.
Against the growing squalor of Soviet life, Alissa nurtured a burning desire to abandon Russia for the West. As her 21st birthday approached, she got her chance. With her mother’s help, she obtained a passport to visit relatives in Chicago, and left Russia and her family in January 1926, never to return. She arrived in New York City weeks later, with just $50 to her name.
The story of Ayn Rand’s life is above all the story of a fierce determination to achieve which, combined with her great intellect and well-honed talent, drove her to spectacular success. She was all of nine years old when she made the conscious decision to become a writer. She studied history and philosophy at the University of Petrograd in Russia. In America, after staying with her relatives in Chicago for six months, she set out for Hollywood. A chance meeting with film director Cecil B. DeMille landed her a job, first as a movie extra, then as a junior screenwriter. It was soon after, on the set of DeMille’s film King of Kings, that she literally stumbled into the actor Frank O’Connor, who would eventually become her husband of 50 years.
 Over the next decade, Rand, whose mother tongue was Russian, mastered the English language, writing many screenplays and short stories. Her extraordinary perseverance eventually paid off, with two Broadway plays and the publication of We The Living. Drawing on her own experience growing up in Russia, this first novel exposed the “noble experiment” of communism for the murderous deception it really was.
 Finally, with the publication of The Fountainhead in 1943, Rand achieved lasting fame. This great novel of American individualism presented her mature portrait of a hero—not a traditional swashbuckling hero, but a man of character and integrity: Howard Roark, architect. Roark demands the right to design and build in accordance with his own ideals and principles. In his long struggle to succeed—a struggle not unlike Rand’s own—he eventually triumphs over every form of spiritual collectivism. This novel first presented Rand’s provocative morality of rational egoism, and this at a time when collectivism was gaining ground all over the world. Made into a feature film starring Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal in 1948, the novel has remained a bestseller for over 60 years.
Atlas Shrugged, Rand’s fourth and final novel, is the crown jewel of her body of work, the capstone of her literary and philosophic career. The Fountainhead had created controversy; Atlas Shrugged fomented a furor. In this sweeping, majestic saga, Rand dramatized the major elements of her challenging new philosophy. She called this philosophy “Objectivism,” with its focus on reality, on reason, and on objective values and virtues derived from the objective requirements of human survival and flourishing. In a 1991 survey conducted by Book-of-the-Month Club, asking members to name a book that had made a difference in their lives, Atlas Shrugged was second only to The Bible. Though granted, The Bible was still far ahead, Rand’s epic story with its defiantly proud characters was, and is, a powerful challenge to prevailing notions.
Subsequent to the publication of Atlas Shrugged, Rand turned to nonfiction writing, elaborating her philosophy in many essays, columns, and public appearances. She died on March 6, 1982 in her New York City apartment. In the years since her death, interest in her ideas has grown steadily. At first overlooked by academia despite—or perhaps because of—its popularity, there is today increasing recognition that her original and inspiring philosophy is eminently deserving of serious attention. She and her ideas continue to be the focus of books, film documentaries, magazine and newspaper articles, and a growing intellectual movement of scholars, organizations, and publications.
Ayn Rand believed that the purpose of art was to paint a picture of life, not as it is, but as it could be and should be, and she did just that with her own art. A Russian immigrant, she appreciated the American, individualistic sense of life better than most Americans, who have a tendency to take their freedoms for granted. She gave humanity the incalculable gift of her joyous vision of the world and of life’s glorious possibilities. It is a vision that resonates anew with each new reader who discovers her novels for the first time, and continues to resonate with longtime fans who discovered them decades ago.
Ayn Rand’s philosophy of Objectivism was set forth in her epic novels Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, and in her brilliant non-fiction essays. The Atlas Society promotes Objectivism and its core values: reason, achievement, individualism, and freedom. You can also find news on this site about the Atlas Shrugged movie trilogy.

=======================================================
Ayn Rand was born on February 2, 1905, in St. Petersburg, Russia, as Alissa Rosenbaum. During her younger years she lived a comfortable, affluent, middle-class existence.  Her father Fronz had become a chemist despite quotas on Jews studying at the university.  Her mother Anna subscribed her to children's literary magazines, which inspired her to write her own stories.  (According to the Rand mythology, she decided to become a writer at age nine.)  In 1917 she and her family witnessed the Russian Revolution as the Communist party took over the government.  The family lived in relative poverty from that point on, for her father did not have many friends in the new government.  
At age 16 in 1921, she enrolled at Petrograd State University.  During her second year she was expelled as anti-proletariat, but thanks to protests by foreign governments, she was reinstated.  After she finished her degree, she enrolled at the State Technicum for Screen Arts, where she studied screenwriting.  At this point Rosenbaum (Rand) knew that her philosophy did not fit with the Communist agenda, and realized she needed to leave Russia.  In January 1926, she got a passport to visit relatives for a short time in Chicago, but she never returned.As a child, Rand had been particularly influenced by Maurice Champagne, Victor Hugo, and Friedrich Nietzsche.  Respectively, these authors gave her intelligent, independent protagonists as role models, showed her the power of a complex story with larger-than life characters, and taught her about the importance of heroism and individualism, although she did not necessarily agree on all points with the authors.  In addition, Rand's negative experiences with communism caused her to become a lifelong opponent of Communism, although she remained an atheist in the manner of Nietzsche (Concise Dictionary of American Literary Biography Supplement: Modern Writers, 1900-1998).Soon after her arrival in Chicago, Rand left for Hollywood, hoping to get a job as a screenwriter.  Around this time she changed her name.  In addition to the usual reasons that people change their names upon entering Hollywood, Rand may have intended to protect her relatives in Russia, who could be punished for the ideas and arguments she was planning to express through film.  Rand claimed that she arrived in Hollywood with only fifty dollars in her pocket and that the day after she arrived in Hollywood, she was given a car ride and a job as a movie extra by film director Cecil B. DeMille. While this account is probably at least partially untrue, Rand did work as an extra in several of DeMille's films.  In fact, it was on the set of DeMille's film King of Kings that she met her future husband, actor Frank O'Connor.  Rand's career as a writer was launched in 1932, when she successfully sold a screenplay to Universal Studios.  While the film was never produced, she then wrote the play The Night of January 16th, which was produced on Broadway in 1934.  Her first novel, We The Living (1936), portrays life in post-communist Russia.  In the preface Rand readily points out the autobiographical similarities between her own youth and the life of her protagonist.  However, it was negatively reviewed in a time when many educated thinkers were in favor of the ideal of Communism.  This novel was followed by Anthem (1938), a science fiction novel about a future dystopia where the world has been corrupted by communism.  Rand did not enjoy real success until the publication of The Fountainhead in 1943.  Rand's last novel, which most consider her masterpiece, Atlas Shrugged, was published in 1957. Rand introduced what she called Objectivism through a 60-page speech given by the hero, John Galt, in Atlas Shrugged. In Atlas Shrugged, Rand characterizes Objectivism as "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute." She also states in her writings that Objectivism is intended to be a practical philosophy grounded in man's ability to reason.  In a speech in 1963, Rand summed up her views. “The motive and purpose of my writing is the projection of an ideal man. The portrayal of a moral ideal, as my ultimate literary goal, as an end in itself – to which any didactic, intellectual or philosophical values contained in a novel are only the means.”  John Lewis writes of her, "Her vision of the ideal man was a theme uniting her early life, her literary career and her later philosophical work." (Literary Encyclopedia). Rand also proposed a theory of aesthetics which she publicized in a series of essays published between 1965 and 1971.  According to Louis Torres and Michelle Kamhi, "Rand's esthetic theory forms an integral part of her total philosophic system . . . Objectivism [is] a neo-Aristotelian philosophy of individualism based on reason and an objective view of reality" (15).  Rand usually named Aristotle as her most important philosophical influence, though Nietzsche also had a clear influence on her. She also claimed to have been inspired by John Locke's ideas about property.  One of the fundamental problems of learning about Objectivism is that almost no one has written about it who is not a proponent of it.  Those who disagree with Objectivism tend to argue that Rand's philosophy is not important enough to write about (for instance, that it is a weak derivation from Aristotle with some other ideas thrown in), so there is minimal significant literature critiquing it.  Rand is also controversial as a literary author because of the intense academic disagreement about whether her books should be studied as literature or whether they are merely popular novels.  One should note that Rand intended to remain outside of academia because of her many criticisms of it, and she did not see the need to be accepted by the academy.  Perhaps she was afraid she would not be taken seriously as a philosopher without a Ph.D. or other relevant formal training.  Moreover, the very argument for Rand's popular importance, her popularity in some quarters, is explicitly rejected in The Fountainhead.  Another possible explanation of Rand's unpopularity in academia is that in 1947 she testified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities about communist penetration of the film industry.  Although many now do not know of her choice in this case, at the time it would have been likely that Rand would be called a fear-monger and a traitor to certain American ideals in that she chose not to defend a person's right to be a member of the Communist Party.Another event that may have influenced Rand negatively is a scandal that surrounded her and her coterie (known as the Collective).  In 1949 Rand began corresponding with a young man named Nathan Blumenthal.  By the late 1950s, Nathan Blumenthal (who had changed his name to Nathaniel Branden) and his then-wife Barbara were at the center of a group of young intellectuals who were devoted to Ayn Rand--both to her works and to Rand personally.  Branden formed an institute with the intent of sponsoring lectures and publications on her philosophy.  At some point during this time, Branden stated, their relationship moved beyond friendship.  For almost a decade Branden was Rand's biggest supporter, advocate, and colleague. In 1962 he and Rand started the Objectivist Newsletter, which became a small magazine called The Objectivist by 1965.  According to Branden (his claims are supported by his ex-wife Barbara), Rand ended their relationship in 1968 when she discovered he was having another affair with a woman he would later marry.  Rand expelled Branden from the movement, announcing their break in an article in the Objectivist without mentioning their relationship.  They never reconciled.Rand's life grew more complicated over the following years.  She developed lung cancer, the Nathaniel Branden Institute fell apart, and the Collective slowly disintegrated.  Rand's husband died in 1979, and she began to reduce her activities.  She never completed another novel, though she was working on the notes for one when she died from heart failure and the effects of surgery on her lung cancer and gallstones on March 6, 1982.

 A New York Times Notable Book A Chicago Tribune Favorite Book of the Year A San Francisco Chronicle Best Book of the YearAyn Rand’s books have attracted three generations of readers, shaped the Libertarian movement, influenced White House economic policies throughout the Reagan years and beyond, and inspired the Tea Party movement. Yet twenty-eight years after her death, readers know very little about her life. In this seminal biography, Anne C. Heller traces the controversial author’s life from her childhood in Bolshevik Russia to her years as a Hollywood screenwriter, the publication of her blockbuster novels, and the rise and fall of the cult that worshipped her in the 1950s and 1960s. Based on original research in Russia and scores of interviews with Rand’s acquaintances and former acolytes, Ayn Rand and the World She Made is a comprehensive and eye-opening portrait of one of the most significant and improbable figures of the twentieth century.

A Q&A with Anne C. Heller   Question: Many people discover Ayn Rand’s novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged as young adults, but you read her novels and essays in your forties. What, at that time, sparked your interest in Rand? What moved you to write her biography? Anne C. Heller: It's true that I didn’t read Ayn Rand’s popular novels in high school or college. I read them for the first time seven or eight years ago, while I was editing a trial issue of a new financial magazine at Condé Nast Publications. Suze Orman--the personal-finance author, who was contributing an article to the magazine--sent me a copy of the well-known "money speech" from Atlas Shrugged. In the novel, the speech is delivered by a young copper baron to an assembled crowd of liberal bureaucrats and corporate welfare-statists. He argues that money, far from being the root of all evil, as the liberals in the novel pretend to think, is really "the root of all good," and "the barometer of a society’s virtue." The speech surprised me with its passion and seemingly air-tight logic and aroused my curiosity. So I read the books. At that time, Rand and her work weren’t in the news, as they are now. Once I had finished Atlas Shrugged for the second time, I looked around to see what had been written about her.  Later, I learned that the novels were still selling in the hundreds of thousands of copies every year and that she was influential among libertarians and certain conservatives; yet no full-scale, impartial biography of this extraordinary woman had been written. Only former disciples and detractors had published books about her. The time seemed right to take a fresh approach.  Question: Do you think your experience with her work, philosophy, and life was different from those who read her in their adolescence? Anne C. Heller: Yes. I appreciated Rand’s insights into the nature of power and her spectacular ability to integrate plot, character, and theme more than I might have when younger. And, I was less susceptible to her romantic celebration of heroic achievement. Question: Ayn Rand and the World She Made is the first objective, investigative biography of Ayn Rand. What new sources did you use for your research? Did you travel for your research? Anne C. Heller: The only other biography was written in the 1980s by Barbara Branden, who was Rand’s friend and disciple as well as her young lover’s former wife. The book was partly in the form of a memoir and was also based on limited information; for example, Rand was born and educated in Russia, but at that time the Russian archives were closed. Thus Branden had to take Rand’s word for most of the events of her childhood. I used a Russian research team to gather new details of Rand’s family background, her parents’ professional lives, and her schooling up to and throughout her university studies, some of which contradicted what Rand had said about herself. I used published and unpublished letters and hundreds of hours of taped, unpublished interviews to document many episodes in Rand’s life that she never talked about, including influences she buried and help she later denied. I traveled all over the United States to work in relevant archives and to conduct interviews with her former friends and followers, many now in their eighties and nineties, who spoke surprisingly candidly about her capacity for cruelty as well as her genius and personal magnetism. I had three lengthy interviews with her long-time lover, Nathaniel Branden, now eighty, and spoke with most members of what used to be called the "inner circle" of her cult following. I also had access to interviews with her elderly Russian sister and with close friends from the 1920s and 1930s, all now deceased.   Question: What surprised you most? Anne C. Heller: I was surprised by many things--by how deeply her hostility to liberal social programs was rooted in her Russian childhood, by her remarkable insight into the psychology of envy and mediocrity, by her personal courage, and by her unfailing ability to spot a flaw in any opposing argument. I was also surprised to discover that many of her former followers, though personally damaged by her temper and her moral absolutism, remembered her as the most important and beneficent person in their lives. They had been wounded by her and yet loved her and were protective of her memory and legend. Question:  Why does Rand remain a bestseller?  Anne C. Heller: She certainly does remain popular. In a 1991 poll, sponsored by the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club, Americans named Atlas Shrugged the book that had most influenced their lives after the Bible. In a separate 1998 poll by Modern Library, readers chose Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead as number one and two on a list of the one hundred greatest novels of the twentieth century, and Rand’s other two novels, Anthem and We the Living, placed seventh and eighth on the list. Combined, more than twelve million copies of her two best-known novels have been sold in the U.S. alone, and sales this year have reached an all-time high. Like Holden Caulfield and Huckleberry Finn, Rand’s fictional heroes strike each new generation as timelessly American in their self-reliance and revolt against timidity and conformity. And her passionate, brainy arguments on behalf of limited government and unfettered individual rights strike a strong chord, especially in times of economic trouble and increased government activism.

       Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum was born to Jewish parents in 1905 Russia. Ayn Rand left Russia in 1926 for America and founded her anticollectivist philosophy, Objectivism, a philosophy of free market capitalism and the pursuit of self-interest as a moral good. Depressive, pill-taking, chain-smoking and manipulative, Rand's life was defined by a longtime Sunset Boulevard–like affair with Nathaniel Branden, who went on to start the self-esteem movement. At the same time, the combustible Rand was married to a passive man with matinee-idol looks. Magazine editor and journalist Heller competently describes Rand's feuds with William F. Buckley and with her sister, who had remained in the U.S.S.R., and the more courtly relationship Rand had with publisher Bennett Cerf. This objective account of the Objectivist Rand will interest her still large and devoted readership. Photos. (Nov. 3) Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

More than fair.Listening to this on audiobook while doing various domestic chores was a real treat. Having read *Anthem*, *Atlas*, *The Fountainhead* twice, and a number of Rand's essays, I have always been interested in her philosophy--not so much as an adherent but out of recognition that Rand's philosophical and political perspective merits consideration in its own right and as an ideological reality on the American political landscape.Heller weaves Rand's unique and impressive life story (horrified as a youngster at the brutality of the Soviet revolution she escapes to America to pursue the improbable dream of being a novelist) with her evolving formal philosophy celebrating the primacy of the individual, the virtue of enlightened selfishness, the inherent moral superiority of capitalism over collectivism, and the rejection of all forms of mysticism in favor of her Objectivist view of the world as real, knowable, and enjoyable by rational men and women of virtue.The biographical sketch also presents a picture that, while noxious to many of Rand's admirers (see below) does not surprise: Transfixed by her romantic vision of human potential and herself and her work as its embodiment, Rand ultimately coped with the contradictions between her ideal world and reality (her limitations and irrational impulses, the failures of followers to conduct themselves according to her stringent standards of virtue, the inability to find in either husband Frank O'Connor or lover Nathaniel Brandon a genuine exemplar of the Ideal Man) with the self-delusion and blind hysteria to which I fear most hopeless and frustrated romantics eventually devolve.Read more ›
118 of 135 people found the following review helpfulWhy will "Ayn Rand and the World She Made" never go out of print?
* "Atlas Shrugged" is Ayn Rand's doomsday novel of heroes, villains, love triangles and politics - set against a backdrop of an American economy in collapse, e.g., gifted innovators disappear, industries merge and close, millions of people are thrown out of work - while the federal government tries to help by issuing "greater good" directives which push the United States closer to socialism.* So who was Ayn Rand and why is she still relevant today?* In my view, what's most impressive - and what makes "Ayn Rand and the World She Made" feel like a book that will never go out of print - is author Anne C. Heller's even-handed (and easy-to-read) summaries of Rand's complex ideologies about American individualism, capitalism and democracy - along with synopses of ALL of Rand's books and lectures - explained in ways that are sometimes more lucid than Rand's original works.* In addition, Ms. Heller's book has a story-telling momentum that's unusual compared to other biographies.  With the help of researchers digging through archives in Russia and throughout the United States, the author brings Ayn Rand's childhood and adult years excitingly to life - making more clear to mainstream readers why Rand's experiences were critically important to understanding how her ideas against socialism and collectivism were formed - and how she refined them over time.  Ms. Heller further illustrates how Rand integrated these ideas into all of her novels, particularly ...Read more ›
Anne Heller's work, talent, insight and dedication have resulted in a book I could hardly put down. She has tackled a very complex subject. It's been three days since I finished it and realize that it may take months to digest it. The book is so huge I can only write impressions and thoughts.The first thing to pop out at me relates to Frank Lloyd Wright. Early on, Rand used him as and ideal whose outsider life and creativity became the model for Howard Roark. After visiting Taliesin she commented that Wright did not pay his assistants, but did she realize that his "Fellowship" was a collectivist operation?  Wright's 3rd wife, Olgivanna, who like Rand was a Russian émigré, developed this cult-like following on his behalf. Wright's fellowship engrossed the full lives and careers of its closest followers who designed buildings, planted crops and did construction and maintenance work for their "Fellowship". Fellowship, The: The Untold Story of Frank Lloyd Wright and the Taliesin Fellowship. He and his lifestyle were the antithesis of Howard Roark.The next impressions are about Rand's family. What of Frank O'Connor? Was this love? Friendship? Fear? Awe? Inertia? 50's values?  The Chicago relatives are not re-imbursed for their help in Rand's resettlement in the US (neither are those left behind in Russia). Is this a cognitive demonstration of selfishness or a representation of Rand, herself, for which she built an elaborate philosophy to justify?  What should be made of the sister from Russia whose comparative contentment with her life essentially mocks Rand's life work?I was surprised at the involvement of Alan Greenspan.Read more ›

      I read this biography, and as well as Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right, and both of them treat Rand's life and works reasonably fairly and coherently.

      The book is well written and seems well researched. I didn't like when the author brings often long comments and passages from the books Ayn Rand wrote.
      I am enjoying this book immensely. A huge fan of Ayn Rand while in high school, I still love 'The Fountainhead,' for the most part, but find 'Atlas Shrugged' a grind on rereading.

This FAQ addresses frequently asked biographical questions about Ayn Rand. These questions include inquiries that have been made to the ORC, issues raised on newsgroups and email lists, and ideas suggested by readers of earlier versions of this FAQ.
    4.4 Who are Nathaniel Branden and Barbara Branden? Did Rand have an affair with Nathaniel Branden? 
This FAQ was last updated on November 4, 2009. Please note that multiple biographies of Rand have been published recently, and information from them is not fully accounted for below. Some changes to the material below are anticipated due to new information they contain.
To return to the beginning of the FAQ, just look for the image of a young Alisa Rosenbaum , and she will take you back to the beginning.
Detailed reference notes are available providing sources and additional background for the information in this FAQ. These are marked in the document with a [*] link that will take you to the "Notes" page.
Ayn Rand was a twentieth-century novelist and philosopher. She wrote several popular novels and developed a philosophy known as "Objectivism." A brief overview of Objectivism can be found at the website of the Ayn Rand Institute.
Rand was born on February 2, 1905 in St. Petersburg, Russia. She moved to the United States in 1926 (arriving February 18) and became a naturalized US citizen on March 13, 1931. She died of heart failure on March 6, 1982 in New York City.[*]
Millions of people have read Ayn Rand's work, especially her novels. Many have found them to be a great source of personal inspiration. Her focus on reason and individualism appeals to many people, some of whom have adopted her specific philosophical ideas as their own. Even among those who do not accept her philosophy as a whole, there are still many who find inspiration and support. The specific things that Rand's readers take from her work vary. However, few people read her work without some strong reaction -- even if it is a negative reaction.
Perhaps the thing that Ayn Rand appeals to most strongly is something she described in one of her non-fiction essays:
There is a fundamental conviction which some people never acquire, some hold only in their youth, and a few hold to the end of their days -- the conviction that ideas matter. In one's youth that conviction is experienced as a self-evident absolute, and one is unable fully to believe that there are people who do not share it. That ideas matter means that knowledge matters, that truth matters, that one's mind matters. And the radiance of that certainty, in the process of growing up, is the best aspect of youth.
Its consequence is the inability to believe in the power of the triumph of evil. No matter what corruption one observes in one's immediate background,  one is unable to to accept it as normal, permanent or metaphysically right. One feels: "This injustice (or terror or falsehood or frustration or pain or agony) is the exception in life, not the rule." One feels certain that somewhere on earth -- even if not anywhere in one's surroundings or within one's reach -- a proper, human way of life is possible to human beings, and justice matters. ... And if justice matters, then one fights for it: one speaks out -- in the unnamed certainty that someone, somewhere will understand.[*]
Rand found that understanding from at least some of her readers, and they in turn find their own needs reflected in her vision and commitment to ideas.
It is a single syllable that rhymes with 'mine' and 'fine'. Some people pronounce it like 'Ann' or so that it rhymes with 'pain' and 'gain.' These alternate pronunciations are mistaken.[*]
'Ayn Rand' is not her birth name, but it is the name she used most of her life. She adopted that name when she left the Soviet Union.
Rand's Russian birth name can be transliterated into English as 'Alisa Zinovievna Rosenbaum.' (The first name is also sometimes transliterated as 'Alissa' or 'Alyssa,' or translated into 'Alice.')[*] In a letter to a fan, Rand wrote that "'Ayn' is both a real name and an invention. The original of it is a Finnish feminine name." This Finnish name is pronounced in Russian as "I-na" and would be written as 'Aino' in English. Rand shortened this to the single syllable 'Ayn'.[*]
How she came to choose 'Rand' as a last name is less clear, partly because of the many contradictory speculations about it:
Barbara Branden repeats a story from a cousin of Rand's, who claimed that Rand took the name from a Remington-Rand typewriter while living with relatives in Chicago in 1926. Although widely repeated, this story contains an impossible anachronism: Remington Typewriter did not merge with Rand Kardex until 1927, so Rand could not possibly have owned a "Remington-Rand" typewriter in 1926. Nor could it have been a Rand Kardex typewriter, because that company did not make typewriters. Also, evidence has been found that Rand's relatives in Russia knew of her new name prior to her arrival in the US.[*]
Jeff Walker suggests that she chose 'Rand' because of its association with South African gold currency ('The Rand'). Like the story Branden tells, this suggestion is also an anachronism: that name for the currency was adopted years after Rand chose her new name. In 1926 the South African currency was denominated in "pounds" and "shillings." (Walker also dismisses Rand's own account of the origin of her first name as a "flimsy legend," although he provides no evidence for this claim.)[*]
Researchers at the Ayn Rand Institute's archives have pointed out that characters from Rand's original name, when written in the Cyrillic characters used for Russian, resemble the letters of 'Rand' when it is written in English. David Hayes provides a discussion of this idea with an illustration of the characters.
This last seems the most likely explanation, because it is consistent with statements in media profiles that Rand's American name was a version of her Russian surname.[*] Unfortunately, without some firmer confirmation, this suggestion remains somewhat speculative. It has, however, been given a tentative endorsement by the Ayn Rand Institute in its newsletter and on its website.
After her marriage, Rand also used the names "Ayn Rand O'Connor" or "Mrs. Frank O'Connor" in some settings.[*]
The following material gives very basic information about Rand's writings. A much more detailed bibliography of her works is available online. More detailed information on each of Rand's published books can be found in the ORC section on that subject.
We the Living (1936) -- Her first novel. The first edition was given a limited printing by the publisher and never reprinted. After the success of her later novels, a revised second edition was published in 1959.
Anthem (1938) -- In length this work is closer to a very long short story (or novella, as these are sometimes called) than a novel. The first edition was published in England, and a revised second edition was published in the United States in 1946. The 50th anniversary edition includes the text of the revised edition and a facsimile of the first edition with Rand's editing marks.
Atlas Shrugged (1957) -- Her last, longest, and best-selling novel. Additional questions about Atlas Shrugged are answered in the Atlas Shrugged FAQ.
For links to the full text of Anthem and excerpts from Rand's other novels, see the Texts section of the ORC.
"The Simplest Thing in the World" was her only short story published during her lifetime. A collection of unpublished stories, plays and other items was published after her death under the title The Early Ayn Rand.[*]
Night of January 16th -- Written under the title Penthouse Legend, this play was originally produced in Los Angeles as Woman on Trial in 1934. The name Night of January 16th was adopted for the Broadway production in 1935. An off-Broadway revival was done in 1973 under the original title. Significant variations in the text of the play exist among the original version, the produced versions, and the published versions.[*]
The Unconquered -- This play was an adaptation of her novel, We the Living. It had a brief run in New York in 1940 and was never published.[*]
Rand also wrote two other plays, Ideal and Think Twice, which were neither produced nor published in her lifetime. They are both included in The Early Ayn Rand, and in a collection of Rand's plays called Three Plays.
You Came Along (1945) -- Rand was credited as a co-writer for revising a script originally written by Robert Smith.
In addition to these three, Rand also worked on the screenplay for The Conspirators. However, several other writers were also involved in multiple re-writes, and not enough of Rand's work survived for her to be listed in the credits.[*]
Rand also began unproduced screenplays for four other movies. One was called Red Pawn and was written the 1930s. It was her first professional writing sale.[*] Three others were written while she was under contract with Hal Wallis in the 1940s:
Before her death, she began work on a screenplay for a mini-series version of Atlas Shrugged. (This script is not the basis for the mini-series projects that have been attempted since her death.)[*]
Rand was not involved in the writing or production of the movie version of Night of January 16th (1941) or the Italian movie of We the Living, released in two parts titled Noi vivi and  Addio Kira! (both 1942).[*]
These books are largely collections of previously published essays. A number of additional books of Rand's non-fiction writings have been published since her death. See the ORC Books section for more extensive information about Rand's non-fiction books.
After graduating college in Russia, Rand worked briefly as a tour guide at the Peter and Paul Fortress in Leningrad, then emigrated to the United States.[*]
In the US, prior to her success with Night of January 16th, Rand worked in various jobs in Hollywood. Shortly after arriving there, she met, by accident, the famous director Cecil B. DeMille, who offered her a job as an extra in The King of Kings. As the movie was being completed, DeMille offered her a job preparing synopses of works that might be adapted for films. In 1927 she left DeMille's studio and for a time worked what she later described as "a bewildering number of jobs," such as waiting tables and selling newspaper subscriptions. In 1929 Rand took work as a filing clerk in the wardrobe department of RKO, eventually becoming head of the department. In 1932, while still running the wardrobe department, she made her first professional writing sale, a movie screenplay entitled Red Pawn (which was never produced). With $1,500 (equivalent to over $20,000 in 2005 dollars) in hand from that sale, Rand quit the wardrobe department. From that point forward she worked primarily as a professional writer.[*]
In 1934, when Night of January 16th was to be produced on Broadway, Rand moved to New York City. While there she primarily lived on the royalties from the play and her first two novels (her husband's earnings during this period were only sporadic, see section 4.2 below). At times she took work as a reader for RKO and MGM, similar to her earlier work for DeMille, in order to survive when other income was sparse. Also, during her research for The Fountainhead, she worked for several months without pay in the office of architect Ely Jacques Kahn, in order to learn about the business. The royalties from The Fountainhead freed her from the financial need to do any work other than writing.[*]
After the publication of Atlas Shrugged years later, Rand was in demand as a public speaker. She delivered annual speeches at the Ford Hall Forum in Boston, and also spoke at colleges, universities and other forums. From 1961 to 1976, she acted as editor and publisher for a series of magazines devoted to discussing Objectivist ideas, for which she also wrote numerous essays.[*]
No, although the accusation is sometimes made against her. To address the issue at length would take more room than is reasonable in this FAQ. However, for the purposes of this FAQ, some quotes from Rand herself seem relevant. After the dissolution of the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), which had provided lectures and other services promoting Rand's ideas, she specifically disclaimed any desire for an organized Objectivist movement:
I regard the spread of Objectivism through today's culture as an intellectual movement -- i.e., a trend among independent individuals who share the same ideas -- but not as an organized movement. The existence (and the later policies) of NBI contributed to certain misconceptions among some of its students and the public at large, which tended to put Objectivism in an equivocal position in this respect. I want, therefore, to make it emphatically clear that Objectivism is not an organized movement and is not to be regarded as such by anyone.[*]
Several years earlier, in response to a fan who wrote her offering cult-like allegiance, Rand wrote the following:
My philosophy advocates reason, not faith; it requires men to think -- to accept nothing without a full, rational, firsthand understanding and conviction -- to claim nothing without factual evidence and logical proof. A blind follower is precisely what my philosophy condemns and what I reject. Objectivism is not a mystic cult.[*]
Rand's writings repeatedly stress the importance of individualism and independent thinking. Whatever one thinks of her otherwise, it is inappropriate to brand her a cult leader.
If success is measured in terms of books sold, then Rand was eventually very successful, although not as much as some authors. Rand's writing career had a couple of early successes, with the sale of a screenplay (Red Pawn) and a successful Broadway play (Night of January 16th). But her career stalled. Her first two novels sold poorly and fell out of print, and a play based on one of them flopped. Lasting success finally came when her third novel, The Fountainhead, became a best seller. She sold the movie rights and also obtained a contract to write movie screenplays. Her fourth and final novel, Atlas Shrugged, was another best seller. Rand's later success raised her profile and she was able to have her earlier works re-published to greater circulation than they initially achieved. Some of her subsequent non-fiction books have also sold relatively well considering their content. As of 2008, the total sales of Rand's books were over 25 million copies, with the most popular being the following (approximate number of copies sold as of April 2008 in parentheses)[*]:
Although Rand's work continues to generate strong sales over 25 years after her death, there are other contemporary books and authors with significantly higher sales.[*]
Rand was the eldest daughter of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum and Anna Borisovna Rosenbaum (née Kaplan), known as "Anna". Rand's father had a degree in chemistry and was a successful pharmacist prior to the Russian Revolution. (After the revolution his pharmacy was siezed by the Soviet government.) Rand's mother was a dentist but became a housewife when she had children. After her husband's business was siezed, she took work as a teacher.
Rand had two younger sisters, Natasha (born in 1907) and Eleanora (born in 1910 and know as 'Nora'). All of her immediate family except Nora died during World War II, and Rand was not even aware that her sister was still alive until 1973. After they rediscovered one another, a brief visit to the US by Nora and her husband went badly and left the two sisters estranged. Nora returned to Russia and survived her sister's death until March 15, 1999.[*]
Rand married actor Charles Francis (Frank) O'Connor on April 15, 1929, having first met him when they both worked in Cecil B. DeMille's movie The King of Kings in 1926. O'Connor was born on September 22, 1897, in Lorain, Ohio. They remained married until his death on November 9, 1979. Although O'Connor was an actor when he and Rand met, he did progressively less acting work throughout the 1930s, and was unemployed for much of the Great Depression. Over the course of his life he dabbled in various jobs, including running the couple's California ranch (when they lived there) and designing floral arrangements. Later in life he was an amateur painter. His painting "Man Also Rises" has appeared as the cover art for The Fountainhead.[*] (Rand's husband should not be confused with the Irish writer known as "Frank O'Connor," whose real name was Michael Francis O'Donovan.)
It was a responsibility that she was not interested in assuming. When she was writing Atlas [Shrugged], she would sometimes say that she was "with book." The only children she wanted were her books.[*]
Nathaniel Branden (then known as Nathan Blumenthal) was a fan of The Fountainhead who first met Rand in person in 1950. He introduced Rand to his girlfriend, Barbara Weidman. Blumenthal and Weidman soon became close friends with Rand and her husband. After a name change and a marriage, the Brandens would go on to found the Nathaniel Branden Institute to deliver lectures on Rand's ideas. In 1962, Rand and Nathaniel Branden began co-publishing The Objectivist Newsletter (later The Objectivist), with Barbara Branden as the managing editor.
In 1968, Rand publicly broke all ties with the Brandens. She accused Nathaniel of "deliberate deception of several persons," failing to keep up with his duties at The Objectivist (which had fallen behind schedule), and financial impropriety regarding loans of money from The Objectivist (which Rand and Branden co-owned) to NBI (of which Branden was the sole owner). She also referred to unspecified "ugly actions and irrational behavior in his private life." Against Barbara, Rand said that she had issued "veiled threats and undefined accusations" when Rand had refused to endorse Barbara's plan to replace NBI with a new lecture service, and then refused to come to a meeting with Rand and others involved to explain herself. The Brandens issued denials of many of the accusations against them, and Nathaniel suggested that the break had come because he refused romantic advances from Rand.[*]
Years later, the Brandens would detail in biographical accounts that Nathaniel had a romance with Rand starting in 1954, which had been sexual from  1955 to at least 1959 (with the knowledge and consent of both their spouses). Rand had tried to resume this aspect of their relationship in 1964. By then, Nathaniel was secretly having an affair with a third woman, without telling either Rand or Barbara. Branden did not admit his new relationship, nor did he outright refuse to resume his romance with Rand. Instead, he made up various excuses for not renewing his sexual relationship with Rand, going so far as to ask for her help in counseling him to overcome his supposed problems. Branden has described his own behavior toward Rand in this period as "erratic ... my absentmindedness, my elusiveness, my coldness -- alternating, as always, with expressions of passionate devotion ... ."[*] Rand's personal journals from 1967 and 1968 indicate that she initially believed in many of Branden's manufactured problems, and spent considerable time and effort attempting to understand and resolve them.[*] This behavior on Branden's part, which extended over four years, is clearly a large part of what Rand meant in accusing him of "deliberate deception" and "irrational behavior in his private life." Because these accounts were written several years after Rand's death, she was never able to respond to them directly.[*]
Nathaniel Branden and Barbara Branden are divorced. She is a writer and lecturer. He is a therapist and author of a number of books on psychology and improving one's self-esteem, including The Psychology of Self-Esteem, Honoring the Self, The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem, and Taking Responsibility.
Leonard Peikoff was a friend of Rand from 1951 until her death. He met her through his cousin, Barbara Branden. He was an associate lecturer for the Nathaniel Branden Institute and wrote articles for each of Rand's periodicals. He completed a Ph.D. in philosophy in 1964. In the 1970s he wrote and delivered (with Rand's assistance and approval) a course on Rand's ideas, which eventually served as the basis for his 1987 book, Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand. Just before her death, Rand wrote an introduction for his earlier book, The Ominous Parallels.
After Rand's death in 1982, Peikoff became the heir to her estate. In 1985 he founded the Ayn Rand Institute to further the spread of Rand's ideas. He has since retired from active involvement in the ARI, as well as from a talk radio show he hosted in the late 1990s.
Alan Greenspan was born in New York City on March 6, 1926, just a couple of weeks after Ayn Rand's arrival there from Russia. The two first met in the early 1950s. The introduction came because Greenspan was briefly married to a childhood friend of Barbara Branden. Although initially skeptical of Rand's ideas, he eventually became a lecturer for the Nathaniel Branden Institute and a contributor of articles to The Objectivist Newsletter. He received a Ph.D. in economics from New York University in 1977. After serving on various commissions and councils for Presidents Nixon, Ford and Reagan, Greenspan was appointed by Reagan in 1987 to be chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. He was repeatedly re-appointed to this position by succeeding presidents, until his retirement in early 2006.[*] The significant events of Greenspan's life are recounted in the ORC's Alan Greenspan Timeline.
For many years it was not clear to what extent Greenspan still accepted Rand's ideas. Some reports suggested he was still loyal to the beliefs he held in the 1950s and 60s years ago, but many critics said his work at the Federal Reserve was incompatible with Rand's political and ethical philosophy.[*] In his 2007 autobiography, Greenspan wrote that although "the broader philosophy of unfettered market competition [is] compelling," he believes there are contradictions within Rand's ideas, and therefore he agrees with them only with "qualifications."[*]
Historian Robert Hessen wrote several articles for The Objectivist Newsletter and The Objectivist. Two of his articles were combined into a chapter of Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal. He was also Rand's personal secretary from 1959 to 1961 and her friend until a disagreement in 1980 (they retained a business relationship until her death). He has written several books, including Steel Titan: The Life of Charles M. Schwab. He is a Senior Research Fellow (Emeritus) for the Hoover Institution.
No, she did not. Tales that Rand ended relationships with people over disagreements in musical tastes seem to stem primarily from Barbara Branden's book The Passion of Ayn Rand, in which Branden gives a brief account of several arguments between Rand and her longtime friends Joan Mitchell Blumenthal and Allan Blumenthal, over differences of taste in music and painting. According to the information in Branden's book, these arguments were part of a generally worsening relationship between Rand and the Blumenthals over several years in the 1970s, which culminated in the Blumenthals initiating a break with Rand (not vice versa) in 1978. Even if one believes that Rand ran a cult from which she excommunicated people, it is hard to see how these disagreements could be interpreted as instances of excommunication, since the Blumenthals remained friends with Rand for several years while these arguments were happening, and they were the ones who initiated the break.[*]
Other accounts of how Rand dealt with artistic differences also fail to support the "excommunication" interpretation. Alan Greenspan is reported to have disagreed openly with Rand's opinions on music, and even convinced her to moderate her negative opinion of Mozart.[*] At least one person who remained Rand's friend until her death was an admitted lover of Beethoven's music: Leonard Peikoff, who was Rand's closest friend for over a decade and the heir to her estate.[*]
Rand first attempted to contact the famous modernist architect when she was working on her novel The Fountainhead, in which the main character, Howard Roark, is an architect. She wrote Wright a letter asking for an interview. This and her other efforts at an interview were rebuffed, even after she was introduced in person to Wright at a dinner for the National Association of Real Estate Boards. However, when the novel was finally published, Wright read it and wrote a letter to Rand praising it.[*]
Wright and Rand met in person on a couple of other occasions, and corresponded about the possibility of Wright designing a country home for Rand and her husband. Drawings were done of the proposed home, but it was never built.[*] When The Fountainhead was made into a movie, Rand hoped that Wright would be hired to do the drawings of Roark's fictional buildings. Unfortunately, Wright demanded a fee so exorbitant that it amounted to a refusal of the project.[*]
One final note: it is sometimes suggested that the character Howard Roark is actually based on Wright, but Ayn Rand denied this.[*]
One of the numerous unsupported allegations about Rand that is occasionally encountered is the suggestion that she was either lesbian or bisexual.[*] If any justification is given, it is typically that she was not traditionally "feminine" in her mannerisms and had a more aggressive personality than was expected for a "feminine" woman. Aside from relying on stereotypes of what lesbians are supposedly like (aggressive and man-like), no evidence is ever offered that Rand had a romantic or sexual interest in other women. The biographical evidence is entirely to the contrary: she was married to a man, had an affair with another man, and wrote fiction that clearly shows her interest in the male body and heterosexual sex. No assignations with women have ever been documented or even credibly alleged.[*]
'Objectivism' is the name Rand gave to her philosophy (she rejected some other possibilities, including 'Randism' and 'Rationalism,' before settling on the name). The Ayn Rand Institute offers Rand's own brief summary of the basics of Objectivism from an article entitled "Introducing Objectivism."
Because Rand commented widely on issues of contemporary politics and culture, one often sees questions asking her stands on various issues. Although the purpose of this FAQ is not to explain Rand's philosophy, simple factual questions of what Rand said on a given issue are sometimes asked. The items that follow discuss her known comments on several issues that are commonly discussed. For extensive additional quotations of Rand's comments on a wide variety of issues, please see The Ayn Rand Lexicon: Objectivism from A to Z, edited by Harry Binswanger.
Rand believed women had the right to choose an abortion. She wrote about this issue in several articles for Objectivist periodicals. In one essay for The Objectivist, she wrote:
An embryo has no rights. Rights do not pertain to a potential, but only to an actual being. A child cannot acquire any rights until it is born. The living take precedence over the not yet living (or the unborn).
Abortion is a moral right -- which should be left to the sole discretion of the woman involved; morally, nothing other than her wish in the matter is to be considered. Who can conceivably have the right to dictate to her what disposition she is to make of the functions of her own body?[*]
Rand supported the existence of patents and copyrights, sometimes referred to more generally as "intellectual property," similar to the ones that exist under US law today (which is not to claim that she would necessarily agree with every aspect of current US law on these subjects). In an article on the subject, she wrote:
The government does not "grant" a patent or copyright, in the sense of a gift, privilege, or favor; the government merely secures it -- i.e., the government certifies the origination of an idea and protects its owner's exclusive right of use and disposal. A man is not forced to apply for a patent or copyright; he may give his idea away, if he so chooses; but if he wishes to exercise his property right, the government will protect it, as it protects all other rights. ... The patent or copyright notice on a physical object represents a public statement of the conditions on which the inventor or author is willing to sell his product: for the purchaser's use, but not for commercial reproduction.[*]
While approving of the general idea of patents and copyrights, Rand was very critical of the contemporary handling of them by the government, calling the US patent system in the 1960s "a nightmare." It is not known what she thought (or would have thought) about more recent modifications of patent and copyright law.
Rand's general views on criminal punishment were summed up in a letter she wrote to philosopher John Hospers:
But you ask me what is the punishment deserved by criminal actions. This is a technical, legal issue, which has to be answered by the philosophy of law. The law has to be guided by moral principles, but their application to specific cases is a special field of study. I can only indicate in a general way what principles should be the base of legal justice in determining punishments. The law should: a. correct the consequences of the crime in regard to the victim, whenever possible (such as recovering stolen property and returning it to the owner); b. impose restraints on the criminal, such as a jail sentence, not in order to reform him, but in order to make him bear the painful consequences of his action (or their equivalent) which he inflicted on his victims; c. make the punishment proportionate to the crime in the full context of all the legally punishable crimes.
She specifically did not believe that criminal punishment should aim primarily at reforming criminals:
What punishment is deserved by the two extremes of the scale is open to disagreement and discussion -- but the principle by which a specific argument has to be guided is retribution, not reform. The issue of attempting to "reform" criminals is an entirely separate issue and a highly dubious one, even in the case of juvenile delinquents. At best, it might be a carefully limited adjunct of the penal code (and I doubt even that), not its primary, determining factor.[*]
With regard to the death penalty, Rand did not write about the subject herself, but she did publish a brief article by Nathaniel Branden responding the the question, "What is the Objectivist stand on capital punishment?":
If it were possible to by fully and irrevocably certain, beyond any possibility of error, that a man were guilty, then capital punishment for murder would be appropriate and just. But men are not infallible; juries make mistakes; that is the problem. There have been instances recorded where all the available evidence pointed overwhelmingly to a man's guilt, and the man was convicted, and then subsequently discovered to be innocent. It is the possibility of executing an innocent man that raises doubts about the legal advisability of capital punishment. It is preferable to sentence ten murderers to life imprisonment, rather than sentence one innocent man to death.[*]
Is there any doubt that drug addiction is an escape from an unbearable inner state, from a reality one cannot deal with, from an atrophying mind one can never fully destroy? If Apollonian reason were unnatural to man, and Dionysian "intuition" brought him closer to nature and truth, the apostles of irrationality would not have to resort to drugs. Happy, self-confident men do not seek to get "stoned."
Drug addiction is the attempt to obliterate one's consciousness, the quest for a deliberately induced insanity. As such, it is so obscene an evil that any doubt about the moral character of its practitioners is itself an obscenity.
In a passage from a different essay, Rand says that "drug addiction is nothing but a public confession of personal impotence."[*] Her published comments all refer to addiction, and do not include any explicit reference to the idea of using illegal recreational drugs without abusing them or being an addict.
Rand never published a written statement about gun control. Her comments about it in response to questions suggest that she was skeptical of the idea but not strongly opposed to it. In a question and answer session in 1971, she stated:
I do not know enough about it to have an opinion, except to say that  it's not of primary importance. Forbidding guns or registering them is not going to stop criminals from having them; nor is it a great threat to the private, noncriminal citizen if he has to register the fact that he has a gun. It's not an important issue, unless you're ready to begin a private uprising right now, which isn't very practical.
It's a complex, technical issue in the philosophy of law. Handguns are instruments for killing people -- they are not carried for hunting animals -- and you have no right to kill people. You do have the right to self-defense, however. I don't know how the issue is to be resolved to protect you without giving you the privilege to kill people at whim.[*]
Raymond Newman: You have stated that the government ought to be the exclusive agent for the use of force under objective rules of law and justice --
Newman: -- and yet at the same time today we see an alarming rise in violent crimes in this country and more and more people applying for gun permits and wanting to protect themselves. Do you see this as a dangerous trend, number one; and number two, do you favor any form of gun control laws?
Rand: I have given it no thought at all and, off-hand, I would say, no, the government shouldn't control guns except in very marginal forms. I don't think it's very important because I don't think it is in physical terms that the decisions and the fate of this country will be determined. If this country falls apart altogether, if the government collapses bankrupt, your having a handgun in your pocket isn't going to save your life. What you would need is ideas and other people who share those ideas and fighting towards a proper civilized government, not handguns for personal protection.[*]
An article published in The Intellectual Activist during Rand's lifetime was squarely opposed to gun control. This article presumably had Rand's approval.[*]
Rand's only known public comments on the subject of homosexuality come from question and answer sessions following speeches. In answer to a question in 1968 about "laws prohibiting homosexuality," she said:
All laws against homosexual acts should be repealed. I do not approve of such practices or regard them as necessarily moral, but it is improper for the law to interfere with a relationship between consenting adults. Laws against corrupting the morals of minors are proper, but adults should be completely free.[*]
Q: This questioner says she read somewhere that you consider all forms of homosexuality immoral. If this is so, why?
A: Because it involves psychological flaws, corruptions, errors, or unfortunate premises, but there is a psychological immorality at the root of homosexuality. Therefore I regard it as immoral. But I do not believe that the government has the right to prohibit it. It is the privilege of any individual to use his sex life in whichever way he wants it. That's his legal right, provided he is not forcing it on anyone. And therefore the idea that it's proper among consenting adults is the proper formulation legally. Morally it is immoral, and more than that, if you want my really sincere opinion, it is disgusting.[*]
Reports of private conversations held before and after these answers were given indicate that she sometimes expressed a more qualified position, stating that because the psychological origins of homosexuality were not clearly understood, blanket moral condemnation would be inappropriate. For example, Harry Binswanger described her attitude thusly:
I asked her privately (circa 1980) specifically whether she thought it was immoral. She said that we didn't know enough about the development of homosexuality in a person's psychology to say that it would have to involve immorality.[*]
Because she did not speak at length on the subject in public and no essays about it were published by her or her associates during her lifetime, any further details of her positions are not known, although her personal disapproval and distaste for homosexuality are clear.
Like many terms, the word 'libertarian' is used in a variety of ways. In it's broadest uses, it is often applied to Rand's political philosophy, as well as to various other, conflicting ideologies. However, Rand herself did not use this term to describe her ideas. Instead, she used terms such as 'capitalism' (or 'laissez-faire capitalism') and 'individual rights' throughout her writings. During a series of lectures on writing, Rand explained her avoidance of many popular political designations:
... [T]ake the word "liberal." In the nineteenth century, this was a proper term which stood for one who defended rights and limited government -- except that it never represented a fully consistent political philosophy. So historically, what started as nineteenth-century liberalism gradually became modern liberalism. (Conservatives used to claim that they were the true liberals, but they have given up doing so.) Similarly, some people today use "libertarian" to designate the pro-free enterprise position, but there are some modern liberals who call themselves libertarians as well. This stealing of terms with undefined connotations is so prevalent today that I simply do not use any of these words. This is one reason I prefer "pro-capitalist" to "conservative." When what is being disguised or destroyed is not exactly what you uphold, then drop the word and use another.[*]
Her one use of the specific word 'libertarian' in her writings published before her death is negative:
Above all, do not join the wrong ideological groups or movements, in order to "do something." By "ideological" (in this context), I mean groups or movements proclaiming some vaguely generalized, undefined (and, usually, contradictory) political goals. (E.g., the Conservative Party, which subordinates reason to faith, and substitutes theocracy for capitalism; or the "libertarian" hippies, who subordinate reason to whims, and substitute anarchism for capitalism.) To join such groups means to reverse the philosophical hierarchy and to sell out fundamental principles for the sake of some superficial political action which is bound to fail.[*]
Please tell your daughter that I am profoundly opposed to today's so-called libertarian movement and to the theories of Dr. Murray Rothbard. [ORC Note: Rothbard was a well-known anarchist with whom Rand had a brief personal association in the 1950s.] So-called libertarians are my avowed enemies, yet I've heard many reports on their attempts to cash in on my name and mislead readers into the exact opposite of my views.[*]
In question and answer sessions after some of her public speeches, Rand was sometimes even more harsh, referring to libertarians as "plagiarists" of her political ideas and saying that the Libertarian Party was "rush[ing] into politics in order to get publicity."[*]
Rand strongly disapproved of anarchism and in her later years appears to have associated that ideology with the term 'libertarian.' This association is further reaffirmed by the comments of Harry Binswanger in an article published a few months before Rand's death, in which he repeatedly refers to "'libertarian' anarchists."[*]
Peter Schwartz's article "Libertarianism: The Perversion of Liberty," which appears in the Rand anthology The Voice of Reason, condemns Libertarians (Schwartz uses the capital 'L' throughout). This article was written several years after Rand's death. Therefore, it would be a mistake to attribute any of its specific details to her, since she never saw the article itself. However, it is an accurate reflection of her general views on the subject.
Rand mentioned privacy as a significant value occasionally in her writings, most notably in The Fountainhead:
Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy. The savage's whole existence is public, ruled by the laws of his tribe. Civilization is the process of setting man free from men.[*]
She did not discuss the concept of a right to privacy in any detail in her public writings, and made only a brief mention of it in a personal letter:
An issue such as "the invasion of privacy" cannot be discussed without a clear definition of the right to privacy, and this cannot be discussed outside the context of clearly defined and upheld individual rights.[*]
It seems clear, however, that Rand did believe there was some type of right to privacy. In addition to her comments above, she also allowed her lawyer to invoke it on her behalf in an article in The Objectivist.[*] She did not, however, expound on the scope or implications of this right.
Rand was strongly opposed to racism, which she described as "the lowest, most crudely primitive form of collectivism." However, she was also opposed to civil rights laws that interfere with the right of private citizens to discriminate with their own property:
No man, neither Negro nor white, has any claim to the property of another man. A man's rights are not violated by a private individual's refusal to deal with him. Racism is an evil, irrational and morally contemptible doctrine -- but doctrines cannot be forbidden or prescribed by law. Just as we have to protect a communist's freedom of speech, even though his doctrines are evil, so we have to protect a racist's right to the use and disposal of his own property. Private racism is not a legal, but a moral issue -- and can be fought only by private means, such as economic boycott or social ostracism.[*]
Beyond racism as it is commonly understood, Rand was also opposed to biases based solely on the ethnic heritage of a smaller group, condemning both racial and ethnic bias as examples of "tribalism."[*]
Rand opposed compulsory taxation. In an essay on "Government Financing in a Free Society," she said that payment for governmental services (police, etc.) should be voluntary. She suggested a couple of possible methods for voluntary financing of government, and indicated that there were also other possibilities.[*]
Rand's negative view of Kant is widely known and is given expression throughout her writings, although she discussed him at length in only a few essays. Her comments about him include:
"Our age is witnessing the ultimate climax, the cashing-in on a long process of destruction, at the end of the road laid out by Kant." ("The Cashing-In: The Student 'Rebellion'" in Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, p. 246)
"In modern history, the philosophy of Kant is a systematic rationalization of every major psychological vice." ("Philosophical Detection" in Philosophy: Who Needs It, p. 19)
"[I]t is Kant that I am challenging, at his very root and base. I do not believe that modern philosophy can be discussed without reaching an understanding on Kant."  (Letters of Ayn Rand, p. 504)
"Capitalism cannot exist, nor survive, on a foundation of irrationality -- and the two arch-destroyers of reason in modern history are Hume and Kant." (Letters of Ayn Rand, p. 642)
"An intellectual leader such as Aristotle does not seek blind believers and formula-reciters; a leader such as Immanuel Kant does." (Journals of Ayn Rand, p. 682)
Rand's most extensive discussions of Kant are in "From the Horse's Mouth" (in Philosophy: Who Needs It) and the title essay of For the New Intellectual.[*]
Whether Rand's descriptions of Kant's ideas and motives were accurate is a subject of some controversy, and she is often accused of misrepresenting him.[*]
Rand entered the University of Petrograd on October 2, 1921, when she was just 16. (Petrograd was the new name of her birthplace, St. Petersburg.) Just over three years later, she received her degree on October 13, 1924, from the newly renamed University of Leningrad. (The city had changed names again as well.) Her study was with the "Department of Social Pedagogy." As researcher Chris Matthew Sciabarra describes it, the course of study with this department was an "integration of the historical and philosophical disciplines [which] sought to prepare students for careers as social science educators." Rand specifically majored in history, and minored in philosophy.[*]
Shortly after graduating from the university, she enrolled in the State Institute for Cinema Arts (also in Leningrad), with the intention of studying screenwriting. Her enrollment in the two-year course of study was to be cut short, because in late 1925 she was given permission to leave to Soviet Union. As a result, she did not actually get to study screenwriting at the Institute, because that subject was not taught until the second year. Rand left having taken courses on make-up, dance, art history, etc., but no writing courses.[*]
Rand took philosophy classes during her undergraduate studies at the University of Petrograd (see question 5.4 above). The early biography Who Is Ayn Rand? tells a story of Rand taking a single class "in the history of ancient philosophy" from "Professor N.O. Lossky ... a distinguished international authority on Plato's philosophy." In the story, Rand impresses Lossky and receives a perfect grade on her final exam. This story was based on Rand's own recollections and is repeated in a subsequent biography, The Passion of Ayn Rand.[*]
In Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical, Chris Matthew Sciabarra raised questions about the accuracy of Rand's account. He noted that Lossky was ill during Rand's early college years, and was purged from the main university faculty by the Communists, making it difficult (although not impossible) for Rand to have taken a class from him.[*] These questions in turn led some critics to dismiss Rand's account as inaccurate or even invented.[*] However, Sciabarra's own subsequent research confirmed portions of the account that he had previously questioned, leading to a greater confidence that the story is essentially accurate. It is clear from her university transcripts that she took a class of the type she described, at a time when it would have been possible for Lossky to teach it. Unfortunately, no records have been uncovered that specifically indicate who the teacher of that class was, so Rand's recollection cannot be fully confirmed.[*]
In any case, it should be noted that the account has always been that Rand took one class from Lossky, not that she studied under him for an extended period. Similarly, answering whether Rand took a class from Lossky does not indicate how much she may have been influenced by him.[*]
Rand's early thinking was clearly influenced by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who is most famous for his idea of the "superman" who is "beyond good and evil." Signs of his influence can be found in the first editions of her novels We the Living and Anthem. (She later revised both books, including revision or elimination of the most obviously Nietzschean passages.)[*] Her journal entries for this period mention and quote Nietzsche in a number of places.[*]
During the period in which she wrote The Fountainhead, she turned solidly against Nietzsche's ideas. The tragically flawed character of Gail Wynand in that novel is often interpreted as a representation of Nietzschean ideals. In her introduction to the novel's 25th anniversary edition, she refers to her "profound disagreement" with Nietzsche, whom she calls "a mystic and an irrationalist." Still later she would say, "In all fundamentals ... Objectivism not only differs from Nietzsche but is his opposite. Therefore, I don't want to be confused with Nietzsche in any respect."[*]
Although the existence of some influence by Nietzsche on Rand is clear, the extent of that influence is a subject of debate. Some researchers claim Rand had a "Nietzschean phase" in which she adopted many (though probably not all) of his ideas. Others argue that while Nietzsche influenced the language and imagery of Rand's early writing, she never adopted his core philosophy and always had serious disagreements with many of his ideas, and thus should not be described as having such a "phase."[*]
In 1960, an article in Time magazine covered a speech by Rand at Yale University. In the article, Rand is quoted as saying "The cross is the symbol of torture; I prefer the dollar sign, the symbol of free trade, therefore of the free mind." No such quote can be found in the published text of the speech.[*] However, in a letter to the editor published in the March 21, 1960, issue of the same magazine, Rand corrects a different quote, and then writes, "As to the rest of your report, the direct quotes were selected perceptively and fairly, ..." Her letter makes no specific mention of the "cross" quote, at least not in the version published by Time.[*]
An article in another magazine the next year identified the comment as part of an interview with Mike Wallace "for his column in the liberal New York Post," and provides a more extended quotation of the exchange.[*]
You've been quoted as saying "The cross is the symbol of torture, of the sacrifice of the ideal to the nonideal. I prefer the dollar sign." Do you truly feel that two thousand years of Christianity can be summed up with the word "torture"?
To begin with, I never said that. It's not my style. Neither literarily nor intellectually. I don't say I prefer the dollar sign -- that is cheap nonsense, and please leave this in your copy. I don't know the origin of that particular quote, but the meaning of the dollar sign is made clear in Atlas Shrugged. It is the symbol, clearly explained in the story, of free trade and, therefore, of a free mind. [...]
Now you want me to speak about the cross. What is correct is that I do regard the cross as the symbol of the sacrifice of the ideal to the nonideal. Isn't that what it does mean? Christ, in terms of the Christian philosophy, is the human ideal. He personifies that which men should strive to emulate. Yet, according to the Christian mythology, he died on the cross not for his own sins but for the sins of the nonideal people. [...] And it is in the name of that symbol that men are asked to sacrifice themselves for their inferiors. That is precisely how the symbolism is used. That is torture.[*]
Based on these sources, it is not clear whether Rand made the exact statement attributed to her by the press accounts, but she did agree with the ideas expressed in that statement.
Rand is known to have taken the following positions on candidates for President of the United States:
1932 - Rand voted for Franklin D. Roosevelt on the basis of his stand against Prohibition and limited knowledge of his overall platform. This was Rand's first vote as a US citizen. She later felt "a little guilty" about this vote when she learned more about his political positions. She was not a public figure at this time and did not issue public endorsements.[*]
1940 - Rand and her husband worked as a volunteers for Wendell Willkie. Rand made public speeches on behalf of the campaign. She later expressed great disappointment in his approach to the campaign.[*]
1960 - Although Rand later criticized President John F. Kennedy on several occasions, she is not recorded as taking a public stance regarding his candidacy in 1960.[*]
1964 - With some reservations, Rand endorsed Barry Goldwater, both for the Republican nomination and for the presidency, in several articles in The Objectivist Newsletter.[*]
1972 - After writing several articles critical of President Nixon, Rand nonetheless encouraged her readers to vote for him, in order to prevent George McGovern from winning the election. She subsequently wrote more articles criticizing Nixon.[*]
1976 - Rand endorsed President Gerald Ford in one of the last issues of The Ayn Rand Letter. Her longtime friend Alan Greenspan worked in the Ford administration, and Rand had personally met Ford. She specifically disapproved of Ronald Reagan, who was challenging Ford for the Republican nomination, on the basis of his opposition to abortion rights[*]
1980 - Rand did not endorse or vote for any candidate. She continued to oppose Reagan and his "mixture of capitalism and religion," calling him "the representative of the worst kind of conservatism."[*]
The accusation is sometimes made that Rand did not read philosophical or intellectual works from other writers. One critic went so far as to declare that she "read almost nothing but detective novels."[*] Such claims are exaggerated at best. Although Rand apparently did not read extensively in contemporary academic philosophy, she clearly read much more than "detective novels." Nor can it be said that she did not ready any contemporary academic philosophy, since she read such works by Brand Blanshard, John Hospers, John Herman Randall, and W.T. Stace. Works that Rand is known or believed to have read (from various biographical sources) are cataloged on the What Ayn Rand Read page. They include books on philosophy, history and economics, as well as a few detective novels.
In the 1950s and 1960s, Rand sometimes referred to Nathaniel Branden as her "intellectual heir." According to Branden, she once explained this to a journalist as follows: "It means Mr. Branden is the most consistent embodiment of  what I write about, that he understands my philosophy better than anyone, and that he represents the next generation who will carry my work further." After her break with Branden in 1968, she ceased to apply this designation to him, and she is not known to have applied it to anyone else. Since her death, the term has sometimes been used to describe Leonard Peikoff, who is her legal heir and a prominent exponent of her ideas.[*]
Rand used this term to refer to lighthearted popular music that she enjoyed. According to Leonard Peikoff's description of it, "Tiddlywink music was basically turn-of-the-century popular music of which there is no equivalent today. Completely joyful, but unserious, unheavy, light-hearted, fast rhythms ... ."[*] Rand's reaction to such music is described by Barbara Branden:
I recall vividly ... the first time Nathaniel and I saw passionate joy in her, the first time we ever saw her totally happy and openly showing her feelings. As we were parking the car, we heard the sound of Ayn's tiddlywink music coming from the house. When we entered the living room, it was to the sight of this serious, austere woman, interested only in the most crucial issues of human life and thought, dancing around the room, spinning in circles and laughing, her head thrown back in a gesture of cheerful defiance, waving a baton that Frank had bought for her -- like a child to whom life was an endlessly joyous adventure.[*]
Examples of this music can be found at Dismuke's Virtual Talking Machine, a website devoted to early 20th-century music.
As with many claims about Rand, this one is rather exaggerated. According to the most reliable information available on the matter, Rand had an ongoing prescription from a doctor for a diet drug that included dextroamphetamine as one of its active ingredients. She took two pills per day until the early 1970s, when another doctor told her to stop taking them. If you refer to any and all amphetamines as "speed," then she did take "speed," although it is probably not accurate to say she was addicted to it. She certainly did not take the street drugs to which the term 'speed' is more commonly applied.
The documentary evidence on this subject is limited. Nathaniel Branden mentions the matter very briefly in his memoirs. All he says is the following:
I did not attach significance to the fact that, since her late twenties, she had been taking amphetamines daily for weight control, on the advice of a physician. I do not think the discovery had yet been made that a protracted use of amphetamines can precipitate paranoid reactions.
She was taking a relatively small quantity of a drug called Dexedrine which in those days doctors were prescribing very freely for people who wanted to control their appetite. Today of course Dexedrine has a bad name and it's no longer recommended. But it was recommended to her, I think, when she was only twenty-eight years of age, and she had been taking two pills a day, I believe almost as long as she lived. I don't think she took heavy doses.[*]
Barbara Branden discusses the matter with more detail in The Passion of Ayn Rand. Her discussion in full is as follows:
It was during this period of nonstop work on The Fountainhead that Ayn went to see a doctor. She had heard there was a harmless pill one could take to increase one's energy and lessen one's appetite. The doctor, telling her there would be no negative consequences, prescribed a low dosage of a small green tablet which doctors had begun prescribing rather routinely. Its trade name was Dexamyl. Ayn took two of these pills each day for more than thirty years. They appeared to work: she felt that her physical energy had increased, although it was never high, and her weight stayed under reasonable control. In fact, medical opinion today suggests that they soon ceased to be a source of physical energy; their effect shortly became that of a placebo.
Dexamyl consists of two chemicals: an amphetamine and a barbiturate. It was not until the sixties that researchers investigated the effects of large doses of these chemicals. They found that extremely high doses were harmful, sometimes even resulting in paranoid symptoms; but to this day, there is only the most fragmentary and contradictory scientific evidence to suggest that low doses such as Ayn took could be harmful. As one pharmacological specialist has said: "Perhaps they hurt her, and perhaps they didn't."
In the early seventies, when for the first time she became seriously ill, her doctor took her medical history, and, quite innocently, she told him about the Dexamyl. Disapproving, he ordered her to cease taking them at once. She never took another.
I include this discussion only because I have learned that a number of people, aware that she took this medication, have drawn ominous conclusions about Ayn's mental health; there is no scientific basis for their conclusions.
When Barbara Branden refers to "this period of nonstop work," she is talking about the time between Rand signing the publishing contract for The Fountainhead in December 1941, and the due date for the finished text, which was January 1943. This indicates Rand would have been in her mid-thirties, not her late twenties as stated by Nathaniel Branden. Absent some other clarification, the exact timing of Rand's initial prescription and the exact drug she took (Dexamyl or Dexedrine) remain minor mysteries for future Rand biographers.[*]
Rand's best-known hobby was stamp collecting. She once wrote an article on "Why I Like Stamp Collecting," describing how she had resumed this childhood hobby:
Once I started sorting out the stamps I had accumulated, I was hooked. It was an astonishing experience to find my enthusiasm returning after more than fifty years, as if there had been no interruption. Only now the feeling had the eagerness of childhood combined with the full awareness, confidence and freedom of age.[*]
A 1961 article in The Saturday Evening Post declared that Rand's only hobby at that time was "collecting agates." Her practice of collecting stones is also discussed in Facets of Ayn Rand. In her later years, her reported hobbies also included playing the word game Scrabble and studying algebra.[*]
Beyond these, although "hobby" may not be the best word to describe it, one of Rand's obvious passions was discussing ideas. She regularly discussed philosophy, economics, and other topics with both friends and strangers. In the 1940s and early 1950s, many of these discussions were with prominent conservatives like Isabel Patterson and Henry Hazlitt. Over time, and especially after the success of Atlas Shrugged in 1957, Rand increasingly hosted such discussions with her own fans and admirers.
Rand had several pet cats over the years, including ones named Turtle Cat, Frisco, Thunderbird, Ali and Junior.[*]
No, although some of her manuscripts were donated by her heir, Leonard Peikoff. He later came to regret his decision.
In October, 1964, Ayn Rand received a letter from L. Quincy Mumford, Librarian of Congress, which reads, in part, as follows:
"Among the most widely discussed philosophies of our time is that associated with your writings. In your fiction and essays you have made the Objectivist philosophy an issue affecting many levels of public discourse. When the history of our times is written, your work will have a prominent place.
"In order to insure that your work will be the subject of informed study, I invite you to place your manuscripts and personal papers in the Library of Congress. Here they will join a distinguished manuscript collection which includes the papers of most of the Presidents, statesmen, jurists, artists, writers, scientists, and philanthropists. In fact, all phases of our national past are documented through materials in the Library's Manuscript Division."
Although her initial response was positive, Rand never formalized her acceptance, despite efforts by the Library to have her do so. At her death, her papers and manuscripts were left to Peikoff, with no conditions or bequests to the Library. In 1991, he decided to donate a portion of her manuscripts (those for her novels) to the Library. However, he retained two pages of The Fountainhead as a memento.
In 1998, Peikoff mentioned in a newspaper interview that he still had the two pages. The Library subsequently threatened legal action against him. The government claimed that the pages were part of the materials he had donated, and thus were the property of the Library. In 2002, Peikoff acquiesced and turned over the pages, rather than fight the Library in court.[*]
The remainder of Rand's papers are in private hands. A large portion of them are in the possession of the Ayn Rand Institute Archives. The books Letters of Ayn Rand and Journals of Ayn Rand have been published based on these materials, and portions of her private journals are also included in the book The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics by James S. Valliant.
Another group of Rand manuscripts, consisting of draft versions of many of her non-fiction articles, were in the possession of Robert Hessen. When Hessen announced that he would sell these manuscripts at auction in 1998, Peikoff disputed Hessen's ownership of the papers. However, no legal action was filed. The auction was allowed to proceed, and included both Hessen's materials and some of Rand's papers that belonged to Barbara Branden. This material now in the hands of various private collectors.[*]
While they are not as widely used now, 'Miss' and 'Mrs.' were standard courtesy titles for women during Ayn Rand's lifetime. Although it is common for dictionaries and style guides to say that 'Miss' is a title used for an unmarried woman and 'Mrs.' is for a married woman, this explanation does not give a full picture of how these terms have been used. During Rand's lifetime, 'Mrs.' might be used with any variation of a woman's married name, regardless of whether she was currently married, divorced or widowed. When a woman used her maiden name or a professional name that was not her married name, then 'Miss' would be appropriate, even if the woman was currently or formerly married. Rand's married name could be stated as "Mrs. Frank O'Connor," "Mrs. Ayn O'Connor" or "Mrs. O'Connor." When referred to by her professional name, she was "Miss Ayn Rand" or "Miss Rand."
Present-day usage tends to drop courtesy titles altogether, or use 'Miss,' 'Mrs.' or 'Ms.' based on each woman's own preferred form of address (if known). Thus, she would be referred to simply as "Ayn Rand" or "Rand," or with a courtesy title as "Miss Rand," since 'Miss' is known to have been her preference when her professional name was used.[*]
When Rand died, her estate was inherited by Leonard Peikoff (see question 4.5 above). He now owns the copyrights to Rand's books, essays, plays, etc.
Ethnically, yes, Rand was Jewish. She was born into a Russian Jewish family (see question 4.1 above), although her parents were not particularly observant. As an adult, Rand did not practice Judaism as a religion, since she became an atheist at an early age. A number of Rand's close associates over the years, including Nathaniel Branden, Barbara Branden, Leonard Peikoff, and Alan Greenspan, have also been ethnic, but non-religious, Jews.[*]
A few authors, apparently careless with their research, have stated that Rand died of lung cancer. Rand was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1974, but she underwent surgery, which she reported to be "a complete success." She also stopped smoking at this time. There is no evidence that she experienced any recurrence of the cancer or that it was directly involved in her death, which did not come until 1982.[*]
The following books contain significant biographical information about Rand. Except where otherwise indicated, all of these books should be in print and available from retail booksellers.
Who Is Ayn Rand? by Barbara Branden and Nathaniel Branden (1962). Barbara Branden's title essay was the only "authorized" biography of Rand during her lifetime. Because Rand still had some 20 years to live, the essay is obviously incomplete, and the book has long been out of print.[*]
The Passion of Ayn Rand by Barbara Branden (1986). Several years after Rand's death, Branden published the first book-length biography of Rand. Although obviously skewed by the Brandens' tumultuous personal relations with Rand, it remains the most comprehensive biographical treatment of Rand to date. Some concerns about factual errors in the details of this book are raised by her ex-husband in his memoirs (discussed below), as well as in other sources.[*]
Letters of Ayn Rand, edited by Michael S. Berliner (1995). Released with the approval of Rand's estate, this edited selection from Rand's personal correspondence is a valuable primary source.
Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical by Chris Matthew Sciabarra (1995). While primarily focused on Sciabarra's interpretation of Rand's philosophy and its intellectual origins, this book contains significant original research about Rand's early life and education in Russia.
Journals of Ayn Rand, Edited by David Harriman (1997). Like the earlier volume of her letters, this posthumous release of selections from Rand's private journals is a significant primary source, although some have raised concerns about how Harriman handled the editing.[*]
My Years with Ayn Rand by Nathaniel Branden (1998). Technically this is more a personal memoir than a biography of Rand, although as the title indicates, Branden's relationship with Rand is the major focus. This book is a revision of his earlier memoir, Judgment Day, with a softer edge placed on some of Branden's criticisms of Rand and others. From a purely biographical perspective, he adds a little information about Rand herself that is not available from other sources, and perhaps more significantly, tells us quite a bit about the people around her.
Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life by Michael Paxton (1998). This biographical movie and companion book were produced with the cooperation of Rand's estate. The approach is hagiographic, but the involvement of the estate provided Paxton with an array of photographs and other material that would have been difficult or impossible to obtain elsewhere.
Facets of Ayn Rand by Mary Ann Sures and Charles Sures (2001). These are memoirs in interview format. The book was published by the Ayn Rand Institute Press and is based on the work of the Ayn Rand Archives Oral History Program.
Ayn Rand by Jeff Britting (2005). This compact biography is complemented by rare photos and illustrations from the Ayn Rand Archives, for which Britting works.
The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics by James S. Valliant (2005). Valliant dissects the accounts of Rand's life provided by Barbara and Nathaniel Branden, and claims they are filled with errors and contradictions. He also presents previously unpublished material from Rand's private journals, discussing her relationship with Nathaniel Branden.
Goddess of the Market by Jennifer Burns (2009). Burns is an intellectual historian, and her book is a biography focused Rand's intellectual development and her relationship to the conservative and libertarian movements. Includes significant new research from material at the Ayn Rand Archives.
Ayn Rand and the World She Made by Anne C. Heller (2009). The first full-length, comprehensive biography by a journalist who had no prior involvement with Rand or Objectivism.
The following works contain some biographical information, but are generally less useful than the ones listed above:
The Ayn Rand Companion by Mimi Reisel Gladstein (1984). The brief (less than 15 pages) biographical essay in this book is largely derived from Barbara Branden's work, adding little original biographical value. However, some readers may find use for the book's extensive bibliography of works by, about, or mentioning Rand. A revised edition called The New Ayn Rand Companion was published in 1999 and contains updated biographical and bibliographic information.
Ayn Rand by James Baker (1987). This entry in Twayne's United States Authors series includes a brief biography, and also provides background for each of her books in chronological order. It offers no significant factual information that cannot be gathered from other sources, and the author often uncritically repeats dubious information, such as when he references Jerome Tuccille's satirical It Usually Begins with Ayn Rand as if it were a biography. (This book is out of print.)
Judgment Day: My Years with Ayn Rand by Nathaniel Branden (1989). The original version of Branden's memoir shows his grudges in more overt form and includes some details that many would rather not know, such as what he and Rand did in bed when they were having an affair. It has been supplanted by the revised and retitled version discussed above, and is now out of print.
In Defense of Ayn Rand by Virginia L.L. Hamel. This short, privately published booklet contains three essays responding to negative portrayals of Rand in other biographical works. The longest (over half the book) critiques Nathaniel Branden's Judgment Day. (This book is out of print.)
Russian Writings on Hollywood by Ayn Rand, edited by Michael S. Berliner (1999). Although this book is primarily a reprinting and translation of two short works Rand wrote while still a student in the Soviet Union, Berliner's introduction and editorial notes provide some useful background information about Rand's early life.
The Ayn Rand Cult by Jeff Walker (1999). Although Walker did original research interviewing Rand's former friends and associates, the product he output is a collection of gossip, innuendo and speculation, all supposedly supporting Walker's thesis that Objectivism is a cult. From a biographical perspective, the only benefit (if one wishes to call it that) of this book is to give a lasting form to almost every negative rumor ever circulated about Rand as of the time of its publication.
On Ayn Rand by Allan Gotthelf (2000). This entry in the Wadsworth Philosophers Series includes a 15-page biographical summary.
Greenspan: The Man Behind Money by Justin Martin (2000). This biography of Alan Greenspan includes information about his relationship with Rand.
Ayn Rand and Business by Donna Greiner and Theodore B. Kinni (2001). This book on applying Rand's ideas to business begins with a 26-page biographical sketch.
Alan Shrugged by Jerome Tuccille (2002). This biography of Alan Greenspan includes material discussing his relationships with Rand and other Objectivists. Although Tuccille does not provide proper source notes, his material is clearly derivative from other widely available accounts, including the book by Justin Martin listed above. A few gross errors in his discussions of Rand suggest that some of the material was not fact-checked.[*]
Ayn Rand and Song of Russia by Robert Mayhew (2004). This book contains detailed biographical information within its area of focus, which is her testimony before the House Un-American Affairs Committee.
The Fountainheads by Donald Leslie Johnson (2005). This academic study provides detailed information on Rand's relationship with architect Frank Lloyd Wright.
The Age of Turbulence by Alan Greenspan (2007). Greenspan's autobiography includes material about his relationship with Rand.
There are several books about Rand's literary output that also contain biographical material, primarily related to the writing of specific works:
More detailed information on all the books mentioned above can be found through the ORC sections on books by Ayn Rand and books about Ayn Rand.
One final note: Jerome Tuccille's It Usually Begins with Ayn Rand and It Still Begins with Ayn Rand (or his combination of the two, The Gospel According to Ayn Rand) are sometimes mistaken as books that might contain biographical information about Rand. They do not. These are highly fictionalized works of satirical memoir, and most of their content is not about Rand at all.[*]
In addition to the books mentioned above, there are a number of shorter works (articles, pamphlets, etc.) about Rand's life or some aspect thereof. Some of these are strongly biased and/or contain misinformation. A listing of every available item would be inappropriately long for this FAQ, but these shorter works include:
Leonard Peikoff's Ford Hall Forum lecture on "My Thirty Years with Ayn Rand," which was originally published in The Objectivist Forum (June 1987) and reprinted in The Voice of Reason.
Chris Matthew Sciabarra's analysis of "The Rand Transcript," an article available online or in the Journal of Ayn Rand Studies (Fall 1999). Also of interest is his criticism of David Harriman's editing of the Journals of Ayn Rand in "Bowdlerizing Ayn Rand," an article available online or in Liberty magazine (September 1998).
Sciabarra's essay "Ayn Rand: Her Life and Thought," originally published in American Writers: A Collection of Literary Biographies. It is available as a 32-page booklet from the Atlas Society.
Jim Peron's four-part article "Is Objectivism a Cult?" (which responds to Rothbard and others) in the online magazine Laissez Faire City Times (July 2000, Volume 24, Issues 27-29, 31).
Additional biographical sources on the internet can be found through the ORC Biographical section's main page. Readers may also wish to consult Mimi Reisel Gladstein's book, The New Ayn Rand Companion, for an extensive listing of print sources discussing Rand as of 1999.
No. Rand did write a novel, We the Living, that is set in the Soviet Union during the time she lived there. In the foreword to a revised second edition of the novel, she wrote:
... We the Living is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. It is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the intellectual, sense. The plot is invented; the background is not. ... My view of what a good autobiography should be is contained in the title that Louis H. Sullivan gave to the story of his life: The Autobiography of an Idea. It is only in this sense that We the Living is my autobiography and that Kira, the heroine, is me. I was born in Russia, I was educated under the Soviets, I have seen the conditions of existence that I describe. ... The specific events of Kira's life were not mine; her ideas, her convictions, her values were and are.[*]
