Nikola Tesla (Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла; 10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian American[2][3] inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.[4]
Tesla gained experience in telephony and electrical engineering before emigrating to the United States in 1884 to work for Thomas Edison in New York City. He soon struck out on his own with financial backers, setting up laboratories and companies to develop a range of electrical devices. His patented AC induction motor and transformer were licensed by George Westinghouse, who also hired Tesla for a short time as a consultant. Tesla went on to pursue his ideas of wireless lighting and electricity distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs and made early (1893) pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. He tried to put these ideas to practical use in his ill-fated attempt at intercontinental wireless transmission; his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project.[5] In his lab he also conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillator/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He even built a wireless controlled boat which may have been the first such device ever exhibited.
Tesla's achievements and his abilities as a showman demonstrating his seemingly miraculous inventions made him world-famous.[6] Although he made a considerable amount of money from his patents, he spent a lot financing his own projects. He lived for most of his life in a series of New York hotels although the end of his patent income and eventual bankruptcy led him to live in diminished circumstances.[7] Tesla continued to invite the press to parties he held on his birthday to announce new inventions he was working on and make (sometimes unusual) public statements.[8][9] Because of his pronouncements and the nature of his work over the years, Tesla gained a reputation in popular culture as the archetypal "mad scientist."[10] He died on 7 January 1943.
Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity after his death, but since the 1990s, his reputation has experienced a resurgence in popular culture.[11] His work and reputed inventions are also at the center of many conspiracy theories and have also been used to support various pseudosciences, UFO theories and New Age occultism. In 1960, in honor of Tesla, the General Conference on Weights and Measures for the International System of Units dedicated the term "tesla" to the SI unit measure for magnetic field strength.[12]
Rebuilt, Tesla's house (parish hall) in Smiljan, Croatia, where he was born, and the rebuilt church, where his father served. Both the house and church were burnt down during the Croatian War of Independence. The Croatian Government has rebuilt both.[13]
Nikola Tesla was born on 10 July (O.S. 28 June) 1856 to Serbian parents in the village of Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia). His father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian Orthodox priest.[14] Tesla's mother, Đuka Tesla (née Mandić), whose father was also a Serbian Orthodox priest,[15] had a talent for making home craft tools, mechanical appliances, and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. Đuka had never received a formal education. Nikola credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother's genetics and influence.[16][17] Tesla's progenitors were from western Serbia, near Montenegro.[18]
Tesla was the fourth of five children. He had an older brother named Dane and three sisters, Milka, Angelina and Marica. Dane was killed in a horse-riding accident when Nikola was five.[19][20] However, according to another account, Dane died after falling down the cellar stairs, but when he was unconscious and in delirium, he claimed that Nikola pushed him down.[21] In 1861, Tesla attended the "Lower" or "Primary" School in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion.[22] In 1862, the Tesla family moved to Gospić, Austrian Empire, where Tesla's father worked as a pastor. Nikola completed "Lower" or "Primary" School, followed by the "Lower Real Gymnasium" or "Normal School."[23]
In 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac to attend school at Higher Real Gymnasium, where he was profoundly influenced by a math teacher Martin Sekulić.[20][24] Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating.[25] He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873.[26]
In 1873, Tesla returned to his birthtown, Smiljan. Shortly after he arrived, Tesla contracted cholera; he was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times. Tesla's father, in a moment of despair, promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness[20][27] (his father had originally wanted him to enter the priesthood).[28]
In 1874, Tesla evaded being drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army in Smiljan[29] by running away to Tomingaj, near Gračac. There, he explored the mountains in hunter's garb. Tesla claimed that this contact with nature made him stronger, both physically and mentally.[20] He read many books while in Tomingaj, and later claimed that Mark Twain's works had helped him to miraculously recover from his earlier illness.[27]
In 1875, Tesla enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria, on a Military Border scholarship. During his first year, Tesla never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams[20][27] (nearly twice as many required[30]), started a Serbian culture club,[20] and even received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, "Your son is a star of first rank."[30] Tesla claimed that he worked from 3 a.m. to 11 p.m., no Sundays or holidays excepted.[27] He was "mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors." After his father's death in 1879,[29] Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he were removed from the school, Tesla would be killed through overwork.[27] During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators weren't necessary. At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling.[20][27] During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family. Tesla claimed that he "conquered [his] passion then and there," but later he was known to play billiards in the US. When exam time came, Tesla was unprepared and asked for an extension to study, but was denied. He never graduated from the university and did not receive grades for the last semester.[29]
In December 1878, Tesla left Graz and severed all relations with his family to hide the fact that he dropped out of school.[29] His friends thought that he had drowned in the Mur River.[31] Tesla went to Maribor (now in Slovenia), where he worked as a draftsman for 60 florins a month. He spent his spare time playing cards with local men on the streets.[29] In March 1879, Milutin Tesla went to Maribor to beg his son to return home, but Nikola refused.[32] Nikola suffered a nervous breakdown at around the same time.[31]
On 24 March 1879, Tesla was returned to Gospić under police guard for not having a residence permit. On 17 April 1879, Milutin Tesla died at the age of 60 after contracting an unspecified illness[33] (although some sources claim that he died of a stroke[34] ). During that year, Tesla taught a large class of students in his old school, Higher Real Gymnasium, in Gospić.[33]
In January 1880, two of Tesla's uncles put together enough money to help him leave Gospić for Prague where he was to study. Unfortunately, he arrived too late to enroll at Charles-Ferdinand University; he never studied Greek, a required subject; and he was illiterate in Czech, another required subject. Tesla did, however, attend lectures at the university, although, as an auditor, he did not receive grades for the courses.[35][36][37]
In 1881, Tesla moved to Budapest to work under Ferenc Puskas at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position.[38] During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.[27]
In 1882, Tesla began working for the Continental Edison Company in France, designing and making improvements to electrical equipment.[39]
In June 1884, Tesla relocated to New York City.[40] According to Tesla his trip to America was fraught with problems. On his train journey to the ship his ticket, money, and some of his luggage were stolen, and he was mixed up in a fight on the ship between the officers and the crew over working conditions. He claimed he arrived with only four cents in his pocket, a letter of recommendation, a few poems, and the remainder of his belongings.[41]
Tesla was hired by Edison to work for his Edison Machine Works. Tesla's work for Edison began with simple electrical engineering and quickly progressed to solving more difficult problems. Tesla was even offered the task of completely redesigning the Edison Company's direct current generators.[42]
In 1885, Tesla claimed that he could redesign Edison's inefficient motor and generators, making an improvement in both service and economy. According to Tesla, Edison remarked, "There's fifty thousand dollars in it for you—if you can do it"[43]—this has been noted as an odd statement from an Edison whose company was stingy with pay and who did not have that sort of cash on hand.[44] After months of work, Tesla fulfilled the task and inquired about payment. Edison, claiming that he was only joking, replied, "Tesla, you don't understand our American humor."[45][46] Instead, Edison offered a US$10 a week raise over Tesla's US$18 per week salary; Tesla refused the offer and immediately resigned.[43]
In 1886, Tesla formed his own company, Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing.[47] The company installed electrical arc light based illumination systems designed by Tesla and also had designs for dynamo electric machine commutators, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US.[48]
Tesla proposed that the company should go on to develop his ideas for alternating current transmission systems and motors. The investors disagreed and eventually fired him, leaving him penniless; Tesla was forced to work as a ditch digger for US$2 per day. Tesla considered the winter of 1886/1887 as a time of "terrible headaches and bitter tears." During this time, he questioned the value of his education.[48][49]
In April 1887, Tesla started a company, the Tesla Electric Company, with the backing of New York attorney Charles F. Peck and Alfred S. Brown, the director of Western Union. They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan so he could work on his alternating current motor and other devices for power distribution, with an agreement that they share fifty-fifty with Tesla any profits generated from patents.[50] It was here, in 1887, that Tesla constructed a brushless alternating current induction motor, based on a rotating magnetic field principle he claimed to have conceived of in 1882.[51] He received a US patent for the motor in May 1888.[52] At that time, many inventors were trying to develop workable AC motors[48] because AC's advantages in long distance high voltage transmission were counterbalanced by the inability to operate motors on AC. The rotating magnetic field induction motor seems to have been an independent invention by Tesla, but it was not a unique discovery at the time.[53] Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris published a paper on rotating magnetic field based induction motor on 11 March 1888,[54][55][56][57] a working model of which he may have been demonstrating at the University of Turin as early as 1885.[58][59][60] In 1888, a month before Tesla demonstrated his AC induction motor, Westinghouse engineer Oliver B. Shallenberger invented an induction meter that was based on the same rotating magnetic field principle,[61][62] and during Tesla's demonstration English engineer Elihu Thomson stated he was working on an induction motor.[63]
In 1888, the editor of Electrical World magazine, Thomas Commerford Martin (a friend and publicist), arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current system, including his induction motor, at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (now IEEE).[64] Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and power system—something that Westinghouse had been trying to secure. In July 1888, Brown and Peck negotiated a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor. Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee of $2,000 ($52500 in today's dollars[65]) a month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company's Pittsburgh labs.[66]
During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars. He found the time there frustrating because of conflicts between him and the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), although they soon found that, since Tesla's induction motor could only run at a constant speed, it would not work for street cars. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.[67]
Wireless transmission of power and energy demonstration during his 1891 lecture on high frequency and potential.
On 30 July 1891, at the age of 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He told many of his companions that he valued the citizenship more than any scientific honors that he had acquired.[71]
In the same year, Tesla established his South Fifth Avenue laboratory in New York. Later, he established his Houston Street laboratory in New York at 46 E. Houston Street. He lit electric lamps wirelessly at both of the New York locations, providing evidence for the potential of wireless power transmission.[72]
In 1892, Tesla spent a few months in Europe visiting other scientists. He later went to visit his hometown,[73] arriving from Paris hours before his mother's death.[74] He stayed at her side until he was exhausted. Nikola was awakened from a dream, in which an angel bearing resemblance to his mother appeared. He wrote: "I was wakened up by an indescribably sweet song of many voices." He believed that the dream was a sign that his mother had died; he later confirmed this.[73] Her last words to him were: "You've arrived, Nidžo, my pride."[74] At first, Tesla believed that the dream was a message from the supernatural; however, after a few months of research, he concluded that his dream was caused by a painting of angels that he had seen before going to bed and that the singing voices had been from a nearby church.[73]
After the death of his mother, Tesla became ill and spent two to three weeks recovering in Gospić and Tomingaj.[74]
From 1892 to 1894, Tesla served as the vice president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the forerunner (along with the Institute of Radio Engineers) of the modern-day IEEE.[75]
Tesla investigated harvesting energy in space. He believed that it was merely a question of time until men would succeed in attaching their machinery to the very wheelwork of nature, stating: "Ere many generations pass, our machinery will be driven by a power obtainable at any point of the universe."[76]
Nikola Tesla's AC dynamo-electric machine (Electric generator) used to generate AC which is used to transport electricity across great distances. It is contained in U.S. Patent 390,721.
In 1893, Westinghouse won the bid to electrify the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago with alternating current. This World's Fair devoted a building to electrical exhibits. It was a key event in the history of AC power, as Westinghouse and Tesla demonstrated the safety and reliability of alternating current to the American public.[77] At the Columbian Exposition, Tesla demonstrated a series of electrical effects in a lecture he had performed throughout America and Europe.[78] This included using high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current to light a wireless gas-discharge lamp.[79] An observer noted:
Within the room was suspended two hard-rubber plates covered with tin foil. These were about fifteen feet apart, and served as terminals of the wires leading from the transformers. When the current was turned on, the lamps or tubes, which had no wires connected to them, but lay on a table between the suspended plates, or which might be held in the hand in almost any part of the room, were made luminous. These were the same experiments and the same apparatus shown by Tesla in London about two years previous, "where they produced so much wonder and astonishment".[80]
Tesla also explained the principles of a rotating magnetic field and induction motor by demonstrating how to make a copper egg stand on end. The device he constructed is known as the "Egg of Columbus."[81]
As a result of the "War of Currents," Edison and Westinghouse went nearly bankrupt. Edison had lost control of his company to J.P. Morgan, and Morgan was refusing to loan more money to Westinghouse due to the financial strain of the Tesla AC patents[82][83] (at that point Westinghouse had paid out an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla, Brown, and Peck[84]). In 1897, Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that if things continue the way they were he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to "deal with the bankers" to try to collect future royalties. Westinghouse convinced Tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over Tesla's AC patents in exchange for Westinghouse Electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of $216,000;[85] this provided Westinghouse a break from what, due to alternating current's rapid gain in popularity, had turned out to be an overly generous $2.50 per AC horsepower royalty.[66]
Starting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of "invisible" kinds when he had noticed damaged film in his lab in previous experiments[86][87] (later identified as "Roentgen rays" or "X-Rays"). His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube. Soon after, much of Tesla's early research—hundreds of invention models, plans, notes, laboratory data, tools, photographs, valued at $50,000—was lost in the 5th Avenue laboratory fire of March 1895. Tesla is quoted by The New York Times as saying, "I am in too much grief to talk. What can I say?"[88] Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image (predating Wilhelm Röntgen's December 1895 announcement of the discovery of x-rays by a few weeks) when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube. The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens.[89]
In March 1896, after hearing of Wilhelm Röntgen's discovery of X-ray and X-ray imaging (radiography),[90] Tesla proceeded to do his own experiments in X-ray imaging, developing a high energy single terminal vacuum tube of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the Tesla Coil (the modern term for the phenomenon produced by this device is bremsstrahlung or braking radiation). In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the "instrument will ... enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus."[91]
Tesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasma. These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.[92][93]
On 11 July 1934, the New York Herald Tribune published an article on Tesla, in which he recalled an event that would occasionally take place while experimenting with his single-electrode vacuum tubes; a minute particle would break off the cathode, pass out of the tube, and physically strike him. "Tesla said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body, and again at the place where it passed out." In comparing these particles with the bits of metal projected by his "electric gun," Tesla said, "The particles in the beam of force ... will travel much faster than such particles ... and they will travel in concentrations."[94]
Tesla's theories on the possibility of the transmission by radio waves go back as far as lectures and demonstrations in 1893 in St. Louis, Missouri, the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the National Electric Light Association.[95] Tesla's demonstrations and principles were written about widely through various media outlets.[76] Many devices such as the Tesla Coil were used in the further development of radio.[96]
In 1898, Tesla demonstrated a radio-controlled boat (U.S. Patent 613,809 —Method of an Apparatus for Controlling Mechanism of Moving Vehicle or Vehicles).
Tesla's radio wave experiments in 1896 were conducted in Gerlach Hotel (later renamed The Radio Wave building), where he resided.[97]
In 1898, Tesla demonstrated a radio-controlled boat—which he dubbed "teleautomaton"—to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden.[1] The crowd that witnessed the demonstration made outrageous claims about the workings of the boat, such as magic, telepathy, and being piloted by a trained monkey hidden inside.[98] Tesla tried to sell his idea to the U.S. military as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but they showed little interest.[99] Remote radio control remained a novelty until World War I and afterward, when a number of countries used it in military programs.[100] Tesla took the opportunity to further demonstrate "Teleautomatics" in an address to a meeting of the Commercial Club in Chicago, whilst he was travelling to Colorado Springs, on 13 May 1899.[22]
In 1900, Tesla was granted patents for a "system of transmitting electrical energy" and "an electrical transmitter." When Guglielmo Marconi made his famous first-ever transatlantic radio transmission in 1901, Tesla quipped that it was done with 17 Tesla patents. This was the beginning of years of patent battles over radio with Tesla's patents being upheld in 1903, followed by a reverse decision in favor of Marconi in 1904. In 1943, a Supreme Court of the United States decision restored the prior patents of Tesla, Oliver Lodge, and John Stone.[101] The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patents were questionable, he could not claim infringement on those same patents[102] (there are claims the high court was trying to nullify a World War I claim against the U.S. government by the Marconi Company via simply restoring Tesla's prior patent).[101]

On 17 May 1899, Tesla moved to Colorado Springs, where he would have room for his high-voltage, high-frequency experiments;[22] his lab was located near Foote Ave. and Kiowa St.[103] He chose this location because the polyphase alternating current power distribution system had been introduced there and he had associates who were willing to give him all the power he needed without charging for it.[104] Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he was conducting wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals from Pikes Peak to Paris.[citation needed] The 1978 book "Colorado Springs Notes, 1899–1900" contains descriptions of Tesla's experiments.
On 15 June 1899, Tesla performed his first experiments at his Colorado Springs lab; he recorded his initial spark length at five inches long, but very thick and noisy.[22]
Tesla investigated atmospheric electricity, observing lightning signals via his receivers. Tesla stated that he observed stationary waves during this time.[105] The great distances and the nature of what Tesla was detecting from lightning storms confirmed his belief that the earth had a resonant frequency.[106][107]
He produced artificial lightning (with discharges consisting of millions of volts and up to 135 feet long).[108] Thunder from the released energy was heard 15 miles away in Cripple Creek, Colorado. People walking along the street observed sparks jumping between their feet and the ground. Sparks sprang from water line taps when touched. Light bulbs within 100 feet of the lab glowed even when turned off. Horses in a livery stable bolted from their stalls after receiving shocks through their metal shoes. Butterflies were electrified, swirling in circles with blue halos of St. Elmo's fire around their wings.[109]
While experimenting, Tesla inadvertently faulted a power station generator, causing a power outage. In August 1917, Tesla explained what had happened in The Electrical Experimenter: "As an example of what has been done with several hundred kilowatts of high frequency energy liberated, it was found that the dynamos in a power house six miles away were repeatedly burned out, due to the powerful high frequency currents set up in them, and which caused heavy sparks to jump through the windings and destroy the insulation!"[110]
At his lab, Tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver (which he interpreted as 1—2—3—4), which he later believed were extraterrestrial radio wave communications coming from Mars. The signals were substantially different from the signals that he had noted from the noise of storms and the earth.[111] Specifically, he later recalled that the signals appeared in groups of one, two, three, and four clicks together.[citation needed] Tesla was highly criticized upon revealing his finding.[22] Tesla had mentioned that he thought his inventions could be used to talk with other planets.[citation needed] It is debatable what type of signals Tesla received or whether he picked up anything at all. Research has suggested that Tesla may have had a misunderstanding of the new technology he was working with,[citation needed] or that the signals Tesla observed may have been from a non-terrestrial natural radio source, specifically, the Jovian plasma torus signals.[112] Other sources hypothesize that he may have intercepted Marconi's European experiments—in December 1901, Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S (dot/dot/dot, the same three impulses that Tesla claimed to have received from outer space while at Colorado in 1899) from Poldhu, England to Signal Hill, Newfoundland (now part of Canada)—or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.[113]
In 1899, John Jacob Astor IV invested $100,000 for Tesla to further develop and produce a new lighting system. Instead, Tesla used the money to fund his Colorado Springs experiments.[114]
On 7 January 1900, Tesla left Colorado Springs.[citation needed] His lab was torn down in about 1905, and its contents were sold to satisfy a debt.[citation needed]
The Colorado experiments had prepared Tesla for the establishment of the trans-Atlantic wireless telecommunications facility known as Wardenclyffe near Shoreham, Long Island.[115]
Tesla's Wardenclyffe plant on Long Island in 1904. From this facility, Tesla hoped to demonstrate wireless transmission of electrical energy across the Atlantic.
In 1900, with US$150,000 (more than $3 million today; 51% from J. Pierpont Morgan), Tesla began planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility.[116]
Tesla later approached Morgan to ask for more funds to build a more powerful transmitter. When asked where all the money had gone, Tesla responded by saying that he was affected by the Panic of 1901, which he (Morgan) had caused. Morgan was shocked by the reminder of his part in the stock market crash and by Tesla's breach of contract by asking for more funds. Tesla wrote another plea to Morgan, but it was also fruitless. Morgan still owed Tesla money on the original agreement, and Tesla had been facing foreclosure even before construction of the tower began.[113]
In December 1901, Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland, terminating Tesla's relationship with Morgan. Over the next 5 years, Tesla wrote over 50 letters to Morgan, pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe. Tesla continued his project for another nine months. The tower was raised to its full 187 feet.[113] In July 1903, Tesla wrote to Morgan that in addition to wireless communication, Wardenclyffe would be capable of wireless transmission of electric power.[116] On 14 October 1904, Morgan finally replied through his secretary, stating, "It will be impossible for [me/ Morgan] to do anything in the matter," after Tesla had written to Morgan when the financier was meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury in an attempt to appeal to his Christian spirit.[113]
On his 50th birthday in 1906, Tesla demonstrated his 200 horsepower (150 kilowatts) 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine. During 1910–1911 at the Waterside Power Station in New York, several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100–5,000 hp.[117]
Tesla invented a steam-powered mechanical oscillator—Tesla's oscillator. While experimenting with mechanical oscillators at his Houston Street lab, Tesla allegedly generated a resonance of several buildings. As the speed grew, it is said that the machine oscillated at the resonance frequency of his own building and, belatedly realizing the danger, he was forced to use a sledge hammer to terminate the experiment, just as the police arrived.[118] In February 1912, an article—"Nikola Tesla, Dreamer" by Allan L. Benson—was published in World Today, in which an artist's illustration appears showing the entire earth cracking in half with the caption, "Tesla claims that in a few weeks he could set the earth's crust into such a state of vibration that it would rise and fall hundreds of feet and practically destroy civilization. A continuation of this process would, he says, eventually split the earth in two."[94]
Before World War I (1914–1918), Tesla looked overseas for investors to fund his research. When the war started, Tesla lost the funding he was receiving from his patents in European countries.
During this time, Tesla was staying at Waldorf-Astoria Hotel,[116] renting in an arrangement for deferred payments.[citation needed] Eventually, the Wardenclyffe deed was turned over to George Boldt, proprietor of the Waldorf-Astoria, to pay a US$20,000 debt (about $400,000 today).[116] In 1917, around the time that the Wardenclyffe Tower was demolished by Boldt to make the land a more viable real estate asset, Tesla received AIEE's highest honor, the Edison Medal.[citation needed]
During World War I in the August 1917 edition of the magazine Electrical Experimenter Tesla put forward his views on how electricity could be used to locate submarines via using the reflection of an "electric ray" of "tremendous frequency," with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen (a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern RADAR).[119] Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high frequency radio waves would penetrate water[120] but Émile Girardeau, who helped develop France's first RADAR system in the 1930s, noted in 1953 that Tesla's general speculation that a very strong high frequency signal would be needed was correct stating "(Tesla) was prophesying or dreaming, since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out, but one must add that if he was dreaming, at least he was dreaming correctly."[121][122]
On 6 November 1915, a Reuters news agency report from London had the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters story from Stockholm stated the prize that year was being awarded to Sir William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg "for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays."[123][124][125] There were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that Tesla and/or Edison had refused the prize.[124] The Nobel Foundation said, "Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous"; a recipient could only decline a Nobel Prize after he is announced a winner.[124]
There have been subsequent claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither was given the award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.[17][124][126]
In the years after these rumors, neither Tesla nor Edison won the prize (although Edison did receive one of 38 possible bids in 1915 and Tesla did receive one bid out of 38 possible bids in 1937).[127]
In 1928, Tesla received his last patent, U.S. Patent 1,655,114, for a biplane capable of taking off vertically (VTOL aircraft) and then be "gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator devices" in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane.[128] Tesla stated it would weigh 800 pounds and would sell at $1,000 for both military and consumer uses.[citation needed] Although the aircraft was probably impractical, it may be the earliest known design for what became the tiltrotor/tilt-wing concept as well as the earliest proposal for the use of turbine engines in rotor aircraft.[129]
Starting in 1934, the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company began paying Tesla US$125 per month as well as paying his rent at the Hotel New Yorker, expenses the Company would pay for the rest of Tesla's life. Accounts on how this came about vary. Several sources say Westinghouse was worried about potential bad publicity surrounding the impoverished conditions their former star inventor was living under.[130][131][132] It has been described as being couched in the form of a "consulting fee" to get around Tesla's aversion to accept charity, or by one biographer (Marc Seifer), as a type of unspecified settlement.[132] Tesla's previous debt owed to Hotel Governor Clinton was never satisfied.[133]
In 1934, Tesla wrote to Consul Janković of his homeland.[citation needed] The letter contained a message of gratitude to Mihajlo Pupin who had initiated a donation scheme by which American companies could support Tesla.[citation needed] Tesla refused the assistance, choosing instead to live on a modest pension received from Yugoslavia, and to continue his research.[citation needed]
In 1935, in an annual birthday celebration interview, Tesla announced a method of transmitting mechanical energy with minimal loss over any terrestrial distance, a related new means of communication, and a method of accurately determining the location of underground mineral deposits.[94]
In the fall of 1937, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and the library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown heavily to the ground. Tesla's back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident (the full extent of his injuries will never be known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor—an almost lifelong custom). Tesla didn't raise any question as to who was at fault and refused medical aid, only asking be taken to his hotel via cab. Tesla was bedridden for some months and was unable to continue feeding pigeons from his window; soon, they failed to come. In the spring of 1938, Tesla was able to get up. He at once resumed the pigeon-feeding walks on a much more limited scale, but frequently had a messenger act for him.[30]
Later in life, Tesla made claims concerning a "teleforce" weapon after studying the Van de Graaff generator.[134][135] The press called it a "peace ray" or death ray.[136][137] Tesla described the weapon as being able to be used against ground-based infantry or for antiaircraft purposes.
[The nozzle would] send concentrated beams of particles through the free air, of such tremendous energy that they will bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 200 miles from a defending nation's border and will cause armies to drop dead in their tracks.[138][139]
An apparatus for producing manifestations of energy in free air instead of in a high vacuum as in the past.
A new method for producing a tremendous electrical repelling force. This would be the projector, or gun, of the invention.[140][141]
Tesla claimed to have worked on plans for a directed-energy weapon from the early 1900s until his death.[142][143]
In 1937, at a luncheon in his honor concerning the death ray, Tesla stated, "But it is not an experiment ... I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a little time will pass before I can give it to the world." His records indicate that the device is based on a narrow stream of small tungsten pellets that are accelerated via high voltage (by means akin to his magnifying transformer).[135]
During the same year, Tesla wrote a treatise, The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media,[144] concerning charged particle beam weapons.[145] Tesla published the document in an attempt to expound on the technical description of a "superweapon that would put an end to all war." This treatise is currently in the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. It describes an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging particles to millions of volts, and a method of creating and directing non-dispersive particle streams (through electrostatic repulsion).[145] Tesla tried to interest the US War Department,[146] the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.[147]
During the period in which the negotiations were being carried on, Tesla claimed that efforts had been made to steal the invention. His room had been entered and his papers had been scrutinized, but the thieves, or spies, left empty-handed. He said that there was no danger that his invention could be stolen, for he had at no time committed any part of it to paper. The blueprint for the teleforce weapon was all in his mind.[148]

On 7 January 1943, Tesla, 86, died alone in Room 3327 of the New Yorker Hotel. His corpse was later found by maid Alice Monaghan after she had entered Tesla's room, ignoring the "do not disturb" sign that Tesla had placed on his door two days prior to his death. Assistant medical examiner, H.W. Wembly, was called to the scene; after examining the body, he ruled that the cause of death had been coronary thrombosis, and that there had been no suspicious circumstances.[149]
Despite having sold his AC electricity patents, Tesla died impoverished and in debt.[150][151][152][153]
Tesla's remains were taken to the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home at Madison Ave. and 81st St. A sculptor was commissioned by Hugo Gernsback, a long-time friend and supporter of Tesla, to create a death mask (now displayed in the Nikola Tesla Museum).[149]
On 9 January, after learning of Tesla's death, the FBI ordered the Alien Property Custodian to seize all of Tesla's belongings,[149] even though Tesla was an American citizen.[154] Tesla's entire estate from the Hotel New Yorker and other New York City hotels was transported to the Manhattan Storage and Warehouse Company under OAP seal.[149]
Dr. John G. Trump, a professor at M.I.T. and well-known electrical engineer serving as a technical aide to the National Defense Research Committee, was called in to analyze the Tesla items in OAP custody,[149] to look for any material that could be sensitive in nature in relationship to the ongoing war at the time.[citation needed] After a three-day investigation, Trump concluded in his report that there was nothing that would constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands, stating:
[Tesla's] thoughts and efforts during at least the past 15 years were primarily of a speculative, philosophical, and somewhat promotional character often concerned with the production and wireless transmission of power; but did not include new, sound, workable principles or methods for realizing such results.[155]
In a box purported to contain a part of Tesla's "death ray," Trump found a 45 year-old multidecade resistance box.[156]
A few days after Tesla's death, the information center of the Yugoslav royal government-in-exile released a statement, giving a short review of Tesla's achievements and the schedule for his memorial service and funeral.[citation needed]
On 10 January 1943, New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia read a eulogy written by Slovene-American author Louis Adamic live over the WNYC radio. Violin pieces "Ave Maria" and "Tamo daleko" were played in the background.[149]
On 12 January, Tesla was given a state funeral at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, the largest Gothic cathedral in the world in New York City. 2,000 people attended. The funeral service was opened by Episcopal Bishop William T. Manning and concluded by Reverend Dushan J. Shukletovich, rector of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava. After the funeral, Tesla's corpse was taken to the Ferncliff Cemetery in Ardsley, New York, where it was later cremated.[149]
On 13 January, a second service was conducted in Serbian by prominent priests of the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Sava in New York City.[149]
In 1952, after constant pressure from Tesla's nephew, Sava Kosanović, arrangements were finally made; Tesla's entire estate (original papers, thousands of letters, photographs and most of Tesla's inventions including the remote-controlled boat, wireless fluorescent lamps, motors, turbines, etc.) was shipped to Belgrade. The estate was shipped in 80 trunks marked N.T.[22]
In 1957, Ms. Charlotte Muzar, secretary and assistant to Tesla's nephew, the late Sava Kosanović, delivered Tesla's ashes from the United States to Belgrade.[22] Tesla's ashes are currently kept in the third room of the Nikola Tesla Museum, in the gold-plated sphere on a marble pedestal.[157]

Tesla obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions.[158] Some of Tesla's patents are not accounted for, and various sources have discovered some that have lain hidden in patent archives. There are a minimum of 278 patents[158] issued to Tesla in 26 countries that have been accounted for. Many of Tesla's patents were in the United States, Britain, and Canada, but many other patents were approved in countries around the globe.[159] Many inventions developed by Tesla were not put into patent protection.
Tesla worked every day from 9 a.m until 6 p.m. or later, with dinner from exactly 8.10 p.m., at Delmonico's restaurant and later the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Tesla would telephone his dinner order to the headwaiter, who also could be the only one to serve him. "The meal was required to be ready at eight o'clock ... He dined alone, except on the rare occasions when he would give a dinner to a group to meet his social obligations. Tesla would then resume his work, often until 3 a.m."[160]
For exercise, Tesla walked between 8 to 10 miles per day. He squished his toes one hundred times for each foot every night, claiming that it stimulated his brain cells.[161]
In an interview with newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane, Tesla said that he did not believe in telepathy, stating, "Suppose I made up my mind to murder you," he said, "In a second you would know it. Now, isn't that wonderful? By what process does the mind get at all this?" In the same interview, Tesla said that he believed that all fundamental laws could be reduced to one.[162]
Although Tesla opposed war and believed that war could not be avoided until its cause was removed, he concluded that some wars might be justifiable.[163][not in citation given]
Near the end of his life, Tesla walked to the park every day to feed the pigeons and even brought injured ones into his hotel room to nurse back to health.[164][165] He claimed that he had been visited by a specific injured white pigeon daily. Tesla spent over $2,000, including building a device that comfortably supported her so her bones could heal, to fix her broken wing and leg.[29] Tesla stated,
"I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them for years. But there was one, a beautiful bird, pure white with light grey tips on its wings; that one was different. It was a female. I had only to wish and call her and she would come flying to me. I loved that pigeon as a man loves a woman, and she loved me. As long as I had her, there was a purpose to my life."[166][167]
Tesla became a vegetarian in his later years, living on only milk, bread, honey, and vegetable juices.[135][168]
Tesla's portrait—Blue Portrait—from 1916, painted by then-Hungarian princess, Vilma Lwoff-Parlaghy.
Tesla was 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) tall and weighed 142 pounds (64 kg), with almost no weight variance from 1888 to about 1926.[169] He was an elegant, stylish figure in New York City, meticulous in his grooming, clothing, and regimented in his daily activities.
"This was not because of personal vanity. Neatness and fastidiousness in clothes were entirely in harmony with every other phase of his personality. He did not maintain a large wardrobe and he wore no jewelry of any kind ... He observed, however, that in the matter of clothes the world takes a man at his own valuation, as expressed in his appearance, and frequently eases his way to his objective through small courtesies not extended to less prepossessing individuals."[170]
Although many of Tesla's progenitors were dark-eyed, his eyes were gray-blue. He claimed that his eyes were originally darker, but as a result of the exorbitant use of his brain, their hue changed. However, his mother and some of his cousins possessed gray eyes, so it can be inferred that the gray of his eyes was inherited.[171]
Nikola Tesla is almost the tallest, almost the thinnest and certainly the most serious man who goes to Delmonico's regularly ... He has eyes set very far back in his head. They are rather light. I asked him how he could have such light eyes and be a Slav. He told me that his eyes were once much darker, but that using his mind a great deal had made them many shades lighter. I have often heard it said that using the brain makes the eyes lighter in color. Tesla's confirmation of the theory through his personal experience is important.
He is very thin, is more than six feet tall and weighs less than a hundred and forty pounds. He has very big hands. Many able men do—Lincoln is one instance. His thumbs are remarkably big, even for such big hands. They are extraordinarily big. This is a good sign. The thumb is the intellectual part of the hand. The apes have very small thumbs. Study them and you will notice this.
Nikola Tesla has a head that spreads out at the top like a fan. His head is shaped like a wedge. His chin is as pointed as an ice-pick. His mouth is too small. His chin, though not weak, is not strong enough. His face cannot be studied and judged like the faces of other men, for he is not a worker in practical fields. He lives his life up in the top of his head, where ideas are born, and up there he has plenty of room. His hair is jet black and curly. He stoops—most men do when they have no peacock blood in them. He lives inside of himself. He takes a profound interest in his own work. He has that supply of self-love and self-confidence which usually goes with success. And he differs from most of the men who are written and talked about in the fact that he has something to tell.[162]
Tesla read many works, memorizing complete books, and supposedly possessed a photographic memory.[172] He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin.[173] Tesla related in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was stricken with illness time and time again. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions. Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they would provide the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing the name of an item, he would be able to envision it in realistic detail. Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.[172]
Tesla claimed to never sleep more than two hours.[174] However, Tesla did admit to "dozing" from time to time "to recharge his batteries."[161]
During his second year of study at Graz, Tesla developed a passion for (and became very proficient at) billiards, chess and card-playing, sometimes spending more than 48 hours in a stretch at a gaming table.[175][176] On one occasion at his laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without sleep or rest.[177]
Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept. Swezey recalled one morning when Tesla called him at 3 a.m.: "I was sleeping in my room like one dead ... Suddenly, the telephone ring awakened me ... [Tesla] spoke animatedly, with pauses, [as he] ... work[ed] out a problem, comparing one theory to another, commenting; and when he felt he had arrived at the solution, he suddenly closed the telephone."[161]
Tesla probably suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in his later years. He developed a hatred of jewelry and round objects, could not bear to touch hair, did not like to shake hands, and became obsessed with the number three—he often felt compelled to walk around a block three times before entering a building, and demanded 18 napkins (a number divisible by three) to polish his silver and glasses and plates until they were impeccable whenever he went dining. If he read one of an author's books, he felt compelled to read all of their books.[178]
Tesla never married, claiming that his chastity was very helpful to his scientific abilities.[172] However, toward the end of his life, he told a reporter, "Sometimes I feel that by not marrying, I made too great a sacrifice to my work ..."[29] There have been numerous accounts of women vying for Tesla's affection, even some madly in love with him.[citation needed] Tesla, though polite and soft-spoken, did not have any known relationships.
Tesla was asocial, and prone to seclude himself with his work.[179][180][181][182] However, when he did engage in a social life, many people spoke very positively and admiringly of Tesla. Robert Underwood Johnson described him as attaining a "distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity, and force."[29] His loyal secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, wrote: "his genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his soul."[30] Tesla's friend, Julian Hawthorne, wrote, "seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer who was also a poet, a philosopher, an appreciator of fine music, a linguist, and a connoisseur of food and drink."[citation needed]
Tesla was a good friend of Robert Underwood Johnson,[183] Francis Marion Crawford, Stanford White,[184] Fritz Lowenstein, George Scherff, Kenneth Swezey.[185][186][187] In middle age, Tesla became a close friend of Mark Twain. They spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere.[183] Twain notably described his induction motor invention as "the most valuable patent since the telephone."[188] In the late 1920s, Tesla befriended George Sylvester Viereck, a poet, writer, mystic, and later, a Nazi propagandist, occasionally attending dinner parties held by Viereck and his wife.[189][190]
Tesla could be harsh at times, openly expressing disgust for overweight people, such as when he fired a secretary because of her weight.[191] He was quick to criticize clothing. On several occasions, Tesla directed a subordinate to go home and change her dress.[172]
When Thomas Edison died in 1931, Tesla contributed the only negative opinion to the New York Times, buried in an extensive coverage of Edison's life:
He had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene ... His method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the labor. But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor's instinct and practical American sense.[192]
Tesla exhibited a pre-atomic understanding of physics in his writings;[193] he disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge (he believed that if electrons existed at all they were some fourth state of matter or sub-atom that could only exist in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity).[194][195] Tesla believed that atoms are immutable—they could not change state or be split in any way. He was a believer in the 19th century concept of an all pervasive "ether" that transmitted electrical energy.[196]
Tesla was generally antagonistic towards theories about the conversion of matter into energy.[197] He was also critical of Einstein's theory of relativity, saying:
I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.[198]
Tesla claimed to have developed his own physical principle regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892[197] and in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a letter to have completed a "dynamic theory of gravity" that "[would] put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space."[199] He stated that the theory was "worked out in all details" and that he hoped to soon give it to the world.[200] Further elucidation of his theory was never found in his writings.[201]
Tesla, like many of his era, became a proponent of an imposed selective breeding version of eugenics. His opinion stemmed from the belief that humans' "pity" had interfered with the natural "ruthless workings of nature," rather than from conceptions of a "master race" or inherent superiority of one person over another. His advocacy of it was, however, to push it further. In a 1937 interview, he stated:
... man's new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature. The only method compatible with our notions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct ... The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. A century from now it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal.[202]
In 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward gender equality, indicated that humanity's future would be run by "Queen Bees." He believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future.[203]
Tesla is widely considered by his biographers as a humanist regarding his worldview.[204][205][206][207][208]
Tesla made predictions about the relevant issues of a post-World War I environment in a printed article, "Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War" (20 December 1914).[209] Tesla believed that the League of Nations was not a remedy for the times and issues.[citation needed]
Tesla was raised as an Orthodox Christian. Later in his life, he did not consider himself to be a "believer in the orthodox sense," and opposed religious fanaticism.[210] He had a profound respect for both Buddhism and Christianity.[27][210]
For ages this idea [that each of us is only part of a whole] has been proclaimed in the consummately wise teachings of religion, probably not alone as a means of insuring peace and harmony among men, but as a deeply founded truth. The Buddhist expresses it in one way, the Christian in another, but both say the same: We are all one.[211]
However, his religious views remain uncertain due to other statements that he made.[212][213][214] For example, in his article, "A Machine to End War", published in 1937, Tesla stated:
There is no conflict between the ideal of religion and the ideal of science, but science is opposed to theological dogmas because science is founded on fact. To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end. The human being is no exception to the natural order. Man, like the universe, is a machine. Nothing enters our minds or determines our actions which is not directly or indirectly a response to stimuli beating upon our sense organs from without. Owing to the similarity of our construction and the sameness of our environment, we respond in like manner to similar stimuli, and from the concordance of our reactions, understanding is born. In the course of ages, mechanisms of infinite complexity are developed, but what we call "soul" or "spirit," is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body. When this functioning ceases, the "soul" or the "spirit" ceases likewise.[210]
Tesla wrote a number of books and articles for magazines and journals.[215] Among his books are My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla, compiled and edited by Ben Johnston; The Fantastic Inventions of Nikola Tesla, compiled and edited by David Hatcher Childress; and The Tesla Papers.
Many of Tesla's writings are freely available on the web,[216][217][218] including the article "The Problem of Increasing Human Energy," published in The Century Magazine in 1900,[219][220] and the article "Experiments With Alternate Currents Of High Potential And High Frequency," published in his book Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla.[221][222]
Tesla's legacy has endured in books, films, radio, TV, music, live theater, comics and video games. The lack of recognition received during his own lifetime has cast him as a tragic and inspirational character, well suited to dramatic fiction. The impact of the technologies invented by Tesla is a recurring theme in several types of science fiction.
On Tesla's 75th birthday in 1931, Time magazine put him on its cover.[223] The cover caption "All the world's his power house" noted his contribution to electrical power generation. He received congratulatory letters from more than 70 pioneers in science and engineering, including Albert Einstein.[224]
The Nikola Tesla Memorial Centre in Smiljan opened in 2006. It features a statue of Tesla designed by sculptor Mile Blažević.[13][232][233]
On 7 July 2006, on the corner of Masarykova and Preradovićeva streets in the Lower Town area in Zagreb, the monument of Tesla was unveiled. This monument was designed by Ivan Meštrović in 1952 and was transferred from the Zagreb-based Ruđer Bošković Institute where it had spent previous decades.[234][235]
A monument to Tesla was established at Niagara Falls, New York. This monument portraying Tesla reading a set of notes was sculpted by Frano Kršinić. It was presented to the United States by Yugoslavia in 1976 and is an identical copy of the monument standing in front of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Electrical Engineering.
A monument of Tesla standing on a portion of an alternator, was established at Queen Victoria Park in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. The monument was officially unveiled on 9 July 2006 on the 150th anniversary of Tesla's birth. The monument was sponsored by St. George Serbian Church, Niagara Falls, and designed by Les Drysdale of Hamilton, Ontario.[236][237] Drysdale's design was the winning design from an international competition.[238]
In 2012, Jane Alcorn, president of the nonprofit group The Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, and Matthew Inman, creator of web cartoon The Oatmeal, raised a total of $2,220,511—$1,370,511 from a campaign and $850,000 from a New York State grant—to buy the property where Wardenclyffe Tower once stood and eventually turn it into a museum.[239][240] The group began negotiations to purchase the Long Island property from Agfa Corporation in October 2012.[241] The purchase was completed in May 2013.[242]
A commemorative plaque honoring Nikola Tesla was installed on the façade of the New Yorker Hotel by the IEEE.[243]
An intersection named after Tesla, Nikola Tesla Corner, is at the intersection of Sixth Avenue and 40th Street in Manhattan, New York City.

Historical Importance of Nikola Tesla: Nikola Tesla, who was a trained electrical and mechanical engineer, was one of the most influential inventors of the 20th century. Eventually holding over 700 patents, Tesla worked in a number of fields, including electricity, robotics, radar, and wireless transmission of energy. Tesla's discoveries laid the groundwork for many of the 20th century's technological advances.
Nikola Tesla’s life played out like a science fiction movie. He often had flashes of light in his mind that revealed the design of innovative machinery, which he committed to paper, constructed, tested, and perfected. But all was not easy. The race to light up the world was fraught with rancor and animosity. 
Tesla was born the son of a Serbian Orthodox priest in Smiljan, Croatia. He credited his innovative quest to his mother, an inventive homemaker who created appliances such as a mechanical eggbeater to help with the home and farm. Tesla studied at the Realschule in Karlstadt, the University of Prague, and the Polytechnic Institute in Graz, Austria, where he studied mechanical and electrical engineering. 
In 1882, 24-year-old Tesla was working for the Central Telephone Exchange in Budapest when the idea for a rotating magnetic field flashed through his mind. Tesla was determined to turn his idea into a reality but he was unable to find backing for the project in Budapest; thus, Tesla moved to New York in 1884 and introduced himself to Thomas Edison through a letter of recommendation. 
Edison, the creator of the incandescent light bulb and the world’s first electric lighting system in the commercial blocks of lower Manhattan, hired Tesla at fourteen dollars per week plus a $50,000 bonus if Tesla could improve Edison’s electric lighting system. Edison's system, a coal-burning electric generating station, was limited to supplying electricity to about a one-mile radius at the time. 
Although Tesla and Edison shared a mutual respect for one another, at least at first, Tesla challenged Edison’s claim that current could only flow in one direction (DC, direct current). Tesla claimed that energy was cyclic and could change direction (AC, alternating current), which would increase voltage levels across greater distances than Edison had pioneered.
Since Edison didn't like Tesla's idea of alternating current, which would impose a radical departure from his own system, Edison refused to award Tesla the bonus. Edison said the offer of a bonus had been a joke and that Tesla didn't understand American humor. Betrayed and insulted, Tesla quit working for Thomas Edison. 
Seeing an opportunity, George Westinghouse (an American industrialist, inventor,  corporate entrepreneur, and a rival of Thomas Edison in his own right) bought Tesla’s 40 U.S. patents for the polyphase alternating current system of generators, motors, and transformers. 
In 1888, Tesla went to work for Westinghouse in order to develop the alternating current system. At this time, electricity was still new and feared by the public due to fires and electric shocks. Edison fed that fear by using smear tactics against alternating current, even stooping to the electrocution of animals to scare the community into believing that alternating current was much more dangerous than direct current.
In 1893, Westinghouse outbid Edison in lighting up the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, which allowed Westinghouse and Tesla to show the public the marvels and advantages of electric light and appliances via alternating current. This demonstration of alternating current convinced J.P. Morgan, an American investor who had originally financed Edison, to back Westinghouse and Tesla in their design for the first hydroelectric power plant in Niagara Falls. 
Built in 1895, the new hydroelectric power plant transmitted an amazing twenty miles away.  Large AC generating stations (using dams on large rivers and power lines) would eventually link across the nation and become the type of power supplied to homes today. 
Winning the "War of Currents," Tesla sought a way to make the world wireless. In 1898, Tesla demonstrated a remote-controlled boat at the Madison Square Garden Electrical Exhibition. The following year, Tesla moved his work to Colorado Springs, Colorado, in order to construct a high voltage/high frequency tower for the U.S. government. The goal was to develop a wireless transmission of energy using the vibrating waves of the earth to generate unlimited power and communications. Through this work he lit 200 lamps without wires from a distance of 25 miles and shot man-made lightning into the atmosphere using a Tesla coil, a transformer antenna he had patented in 1891. 
In December of 1900, Tesla returned to New York and began work on a “World-System” of wireless transmissions intended to link up the world’s signal stations (telephone, telegraph, etc.). The backing investor, J.P. Morgan, who had financed the Niagara Falls project, terminated the contract upon learning that it would be “free” wireless electricity for all to tap into. 
On January 7, 1943, Tesla died at the age of 86 of coronary thrombosis in his bed at the Hotel New Yorker where he resided. Tesla, who had never married, had spent his life creating, inventing, and discovering. Upon his death, he held over 700 patents, which included the modern electric motor, remote control, wireless transmission of energy, basic laser and radar technology, the first neon and fluorescent illumination, the first x-ray photographs, the wireless vacuum tube, the air-friction speedometer for automobiles, and the Tesla coil (widely used in radio, television sets, and other electronic equipment).
In addition to all that Tesla created, he also had many ideas that he didn't have time to finish. Some of these ideas included massive weapons. In a world still immersed in World War II and that was just beginning to split into East vs. West, ideas of massive weapons were coveted. After Tesla's death, the FBI seized Tesla's belongings and notebooks.
It is thought that the U.S. government used the information from Tesla's notes to work on building beam weapons after the war. The government set up a secret project, called "Project Nick," which tested the feasibility of "death rays," but the project was eventually shut down and the results of their experiments were never published. Tesla's notes used for this project also seem to have been "lost" before the rest of his notes were sent back to Yugoslavia in 1952 and placed in a museum.
On June 21, 1943, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Tesla as “the father of the radio” rather than Guglielmo Marconi who had received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909 for his contributions to the development of the radio. The court’s decision was based on Tesla’s lectures of 1893 and possibly due to the fact that the Marconi Corporation had sued the U.S. government for royalties for using radio patents during WWI.

Nikola Tesla was born on July 10,1856 in Smiljan, Lika in what later became Yugoslavia. His father, Milutin Tesla was a Serbian orthodox priest and his mother Djuka Mandic was an inventor in her own right of household appliances. Tesla studied at the Polytechnic Institute in Graz, Austria and the University of Prague. He began his career as an electrical engineer with a telephone company in Budapest in 1881.Before going to America, Tesla joined Continental Edison Company in Paris where he designed dynamos. While in Strassbourg in 1883, he privately built a prototype of the induction motor and ran it successfully. Unable to interest anyone in Europe in promoting this radical device Tesla accepted an offer to work for Thomas Edison in New York.Young Nikola Tesla came to the United States in 1884. Tesla will spend the next 59 years of his productive life living in New York. Tesla set about improving line of dynamos while working in Edison's lab in New Jersey. It was here that his divergence of opinion with Edison over direct current versus alternating current began. This disagreement climaxed in the Battle of Currents as Edison fought a losing battle to protect his investment in direct current equipment and facilities.Direct current flows continuously in one direction; alternating current changes direction 50 or 60 times per second, and can be stepped up to very high voltage levels, minimizing power loss across great distances. The future belongs to the alternating current. Nikola Tesla developed polyphase alternating current system of generators, motors and transformers and held 40 basic U.S. patents on the system, which George Westinghouse bought, determined to supply America with Tesla system. In February 1882, Tesla discovered rotating magnetic field, a fundamental principle in physics and the basis of nearly all devices that use alternating current.Tesla's A-C induction motor is widely used throughout the world in industry and household appliances. This motor started the industrial revolution at he turn of the century. Electricity today is generated, transmitted and converted to mechanical power by means of his inventions. Tesla's greatest achievement is his polyphase alternating current system, which is today lighting the entire globe.Watch the full documentary now Share this film.1.7kSharesFacebookTwitterGet new cool documentaries in your Inbox:        8.85 Ratings: 8.85/10 from 52 users.

Igor Serbs and Croats will forever dispute about which nation he belongs to but the truth is, Tesla was a citizen of the world, a supreme human and unlike any other person. He might as well been born in the Amazon jungle but it is of no relevance. Croats and Serbs who want to claim him as a thing to boost the national ego are fools, Tesla did not belong to anyone but everyone and all he ever did was in the name of discovery, progress and helping mankind.  toddy Any one interested in Tesla this is a must see documentary for it shows some of his work in action  Miguel N. Cabrera I read that Tesla never actually graduated from a university. If this fact is true then he learned enough mathematics and physics to burn new roads in the world of Electrical Engineering.

Survived relatives lives in Serbia. 1991 Croatians destroyed and burn his house in Smiljan."1. Tesla couldn't have 40 relatives in Smiljan because his family originated from another village 30km south of it. What do those nazis have to do with "Croats in general" anyway? That was a quisling fascist state and a lot of Croats died fighting against it.2. Tesla's house was neither destroyed nor burned in the recent war. It stayed abandoned untill it was later renovated.These obvious attempts at stirring ethnic intolerance are ridiculous. Yes, Tesla was a Serb. Yes, he was born in Croatia. Yes, he supported the idea of "southslavism". His greatness owes nothing to any of these facts.  Jellal Yes, it is a story as old as history itself. The greatest minds, the nicest people....are always screwed by the greedy and evil ones who get all the credit, glory and success.  http://profile.yahoo.com/DNTFCSIKOX5TQBPQ3WSL3HL7GE Sydkidkid!!! well, he was a great inventer  http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001834819552 Stefan Perovic Nikola Tesla – Serbian scientific genius.......http://max-balkanboy.blogspot.nl/2012/10/nikola-tesla-serbian-scientific-genius.html  Sampan Chakraborty Tesla-the greatest mad genius of all time,but after reading his entire life I must say Tesla was not any ordinary human being where his ideas were even more far reaching those of Newton,Einstein or Pasteur.He was probably the god's own favorite son who was born to electrify the world and he just did it fighting against all sorts of discrimination and cruel fate.Since 19 year age he did not sleep more than two hours in a day.Tesla was highly influenced by a Bengali Hindu monk and one the greatest thinker of all time named Swami Vivekananda who said about Tesla"I know a man in America who hardly gets any time to come out of his lab but he hears my speech hour after hour".A life long bachelor,these man throughout his life tried to uplift the mankind and humanity and tried to surprised the world through one after one inventions...In my opinion we should worship Tesla instead of reading documentary on him.  sono6ovich Italy did not exist as a country in Marco Polo's time and I rather doubt that Croatia did either. Modern historians have mislabelled this Korculan as Italian because both his names end in O, or because he was employed by Venetians. His original pre-yugoslavian was probably Mrc Pl.  sono6ovich The Palestinians are Semites, and so are most of the people in the middle east. I guess, therefore that the Jews must be antisemitic.  sono6ovich Choose one: "had taken off," or "might induce"  silverpropeller There was only symbolical number of Croats fighting against Nazi  95 % fighters  was Serbs from Croatia ,that was only way for survival for them,after ww2 was one million Serbs  missing  and almost no missing Croats,just watch documentaries how Croatian people throwing flowers on German solders and compare that with Serbian carpet bombed Belgrade. Talking about Teslas's 40 slotered relatives what is difference are they from Smiljan directly or 30 km away.Yes  Tesla's house was burned by neonazi oficcial Croatian forces during 90-s  Nikola Tesla Do not worship Tesla; that is not what he sought. Instead, we should honor him by bringing his dreams to fruition.  nnn actually Tesla also had romanian roots :)  Sampan Chakraborty There are some other people who are equally admirable such as Newton or Leonardo who had similar isolated life style...remained life long bachelor but they did not make such big impact(in field of inventions) in our daily life.Talking about dreams it was indeed not possible to send power across the globe because when space gets large magnitude of power diminish.Don't know whether death ray beam particle is possible or not but it's true that it was Tesla who even tried to capture power from space at Colorado springs even before anybody could imagine it.  Sampan Chakraborty one correction: Tesla said he has  receive signal from Mars for which he was ridiculed but he may be the first person to detect radio waves from space.But now IEEE has given credit to Bengali polymath from Kolkata SIR J.C Bose for invention of wireless and first ever person to demonstrate experimental radio in 1894 and 95 respectively.  http://www.ptm.ro/ Șerban Păun Actually, no.

Nikola Tesla was born in the family of an Orthodox priest on July 10th 1856 in Smiljan, today in the Republic of Croatia. His parents, Milutin and Georgina, had beside him a son Dane and daughters Angelina and Milka, older than Nikola, and Marica, the youngest child in the Tesla family.
Smiljan, the place of birth of Nikola Tesla Tesla received his name after his paternal grandfather. He began his schooling in his hometown, where he spent the most careless years of his life.  After a tragic accident in which the first-born son in the Tesla family, Dane, lost his life, the family moved to Gospic where the young Tesla continued his schooling.  While in school in Gospic, and later at the High Real Gymnasium in Karlovac, he was tormented by the fact that he would have to continue his family tradition and become a priest.  This circumstance did not give him peace because he was genuinely interested in natural sciences.  After completing the Karlovac gymnasium, on vacation, having come back to Gospic, the young Tesla became ill of cholera.  At that time, this wicked illness was taking many lives.
“In a moment close to death when they thought it was my last, the father burst into my room.  I still remember his pale face while he tried to cheer me up, with a faltering voice.  I told him: ‘Maybe I could recover if you let me study engineering.’  ‘You will go to the best engineering school in the world, he told me solemnly, and I knew he meant it.”
As a miraculous recovery really took place, and as his father had promised, Nikola Tesla enrolled in the Upper Technical School in Graz.  During those much-coveted studies, Tesla expressed more than necessary interest for passing the subjects.  Thus he wanted to show his father that he was not wrong for allowing him to dedicate himself to studying the mysteries of mathematics, physics and mechanical engineering.  Still, in spite of the praises of professors he received in his certificates, his father was seemingly uninterested in his son’s success.
“That almost killed my ambition; but later when my father died, I was shaken when I found a bundle of letters my professors wrote suggesting to him to take me out of school if I did not want me to kill myself by working too much.” In Graz, during those studies, Tesla conceived the idea of creating the rotating field.  When he presented the idea that it might be possible to move the motor without brushes to one of his professors, he received the following answer:
“Maybe Mr. Tesla will do great things, but he will certainly not succeed in doing this.  That would be like turning one constant attracting force such as gravity into a rotational one.  It is a perpetuum mobile, an impossible idea.”
In 1879 Nikola Tesla received his first job; he started working as an assistant engineer in Maribor.  The same year his father died and, in order to fulfill his father’s wish to finish college, in 1880 Tesla enrolled in a school in Prague.  The following few years represented a significant period in the career of Nikola Tesla.  After a job in Budapest in the Central Telephone Office, the invention of the rotating magnetic field followed (in February 1882).  That same year, with the recommendation of his superiors, he got a job in Paris at Edison’s Continental Society.  He spent two years there with various and very responsible jobs and, as his abilities could not pass unnoticed, he was recommended to Edison himself.  At that time Edison was the most significant engineering figure in America, the hero of electricity celebrated by the entire nation.  In 1884, he gave Tesla a job in his laboratory in New York, but their collaboration did not last very long. Dissatisfied with the relationship of the superiors towards his work, Nikola Tesla left Edison already the next year and, with the help of some investors founded “Tesla Arc Light Co.”  In the beginning, out of the obligations towards investors, he had to work in the area of carbon arc lights, but after that he started realizing his projects in the area of poly-phase alternating currents.  After the lecture “The New System of Motors and Transformers of Alternating Current,” on May 16th 1888, which he held at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), Tesla got an offer from the firm Westinghouse for buying out patents in the field of poly-phase currents.
Years in which Tesla worked with Westinghouse’s engineers on the practical application of his inventions followed.  On July 30th 1891, Nikola Tesla received American citizenship.
Tesla spent a good part of 1892 in Europe.  Through numerous lectures he promoted his ideas.  He gave a lecture “Experiments with high-voltage, high-frequency alternating currents” in England at the institute of electrical engineers and at the Royal institute.  He repeated the same lecture in Paris at the International Society of Electrical Engineers and French Physics Society.  He managed to visit Belgrade the only time in his life, and he stayed there for three days.  That same year, 1882, Tesla remained without the other parent.  His mother died, and the loss effected him greatly.
After returning to America, a new fight followed.  The proponents of the use of direct current and at the same time opponents of the use of alternating current violently attacked it criticizing and warning about the dangers its use brings.  In this conflict known as the “War of Currents,” those who had a little more vision triumphed.  The world exposition in Chicago was lighted that year with the help of alternating current.
Research in the filed of wireless transport of signals and energy followed.  Tesla publicly presented his idea and intention to direct his research towards that goal in a speech during the opening of the Electric plant at Niagara Falls in 1897.  What was the expression on the faces of the people who, just after witnessing the transport of electricity to longer distances, are told about its wireless transport? Tesla’s research in this field represents a great mystery.  Although he spent almost a year in Colorado Springs (1899-1900), and left a detailed journal about his research, a wider use of wireless transport of electricity has not been accomplished to this day.  Tesla intended to use the upper layers of Earth in order to transport energy from one side of the world to the other.  He described some of his discoveries in the essay “The Problem of Increasing Human Energy,” which caused great interest in the world of science and business.
Probably intrigued with the essay as well, J. P. (John Pierpont) Morgan (1837-1913), at that time one of the wealthiest people in America, offered financial support to Tesla.  Collaboration was achieved on the project “World Radio System,” which Tesla led in his lab on Long Island.  Already after a year, nevertheless, in 1901, Morgan stopped financing Tesla.  The reason for breaking off the collaboration was the successful transatlantic sending of a radio message achieved by Guglielmo Marconi (1874-1937).  Tesla admitted to Morgan that he could have done something like that long ago, but that wasn’t the goal of his research.  Morgan was furious because of this, as he saw it, concealment, and he never collaborated with Tesla again.
Tesla somehow managed to continue the project until 1905 when he completely exhausted the sources of financing, and he was forced to abandon it.  Years in which he worked on improving the existing and patenting new inventions in the area of mechanical engineering followed.  Those years were pretty difficult for him.  The public was reminded of the great genius in 1917 when he was awarded Edison’s medal, the greatest American award in the area of engineering.  In 1919, Nikola Tesla published his autobiography through a series of articles in the magazine Electrical Experimenter.  To the people who were not close to him, the news about Tesla came through newspaper articles in which they were able to read his often overly sensationalistic statements.
Statements such as “How to Send Signals to Mars” and “The Breaking of Tornadoes” did not contribute to his reputation.  At that time, they were considered more a result of a rich imagination than possible scientific achievements.  Tesla somehow survived thanks to his friends and a modest pension he reluctantly accepted from the Yugoslav government.  His health was significantly worsened after the death of his friends Robert Underwood Johnson and Richmond Pearson Hobson in 1937.  That year he also had a traffic accident – he was hit by a taxi while he was crossing the street.
Nearly alone, without a family, only in the company of his nephew Sava Kosanovic (the son of Marica Kosanovic) and a couple of friends, Tesla rarely appeared in public in the latter years of his life.  The exception was the visit of King Peter II Karadjordjevic who came to meet Tesla in his apartment in June 1942.Nikola Tesla meets King Peter II Karodjordjević On January 5th 1943, Tesla called American Secretary of Defense.  In a short conversation, the great scientist offered the secrets of his super weapon to the American military.  The officer did not understand with whom he was talking and, probably thinking it was a prankster or a lunatic, he promised to call back later.
In his 87th year, in hotel New Yorker, on January 7th 1943, the heart of this noble scientist stopped beating.  In the cathedral of Saint John the Theologian, on January 12th, two thousand people gathered, among whom a large number of inventors, Nobel-prize winners, internationally recognized figures from the field of electrical engineering, Yugoslav diplomats.
Two days earlier, the mayor of New York, Fiorello LaGuardia, held a commemorative speech broadcast live by radio New York.
…Tesla was a great humanist –a pure scientific genius – a poet in science…  He did extraordinary, amazing, wonderful things during his life.  He did it simply to serve the human kind – and he did not ask anything for his services. 
A significant part of Tesla lives in his achievement, which is huge – almost impossible to calculate – a part of our life and a part of our civilization, our everyday life, our current effort…" The remains of one of the greatest people living in the last century are found in the Museum of Nikola Tesla in Belgrade in an urn of an ideal spherical shape.
Today, the name of Nikola Tesla is pronounced loudly, with a lot of respect, which this man deserves.  Numerous associations, student and engineer organizations keep the memory of this great man of world science.  Many books have been written about him, many stories and possible and impossible theories told about him, but there is only one truth.  Nikola Tesla was a great scientist, the man without whose inventions we would hardly be able to live as we do – with a lot of comfort and freedom provided to us by electricity.  Our duty is – as a sing of gratitude – to never let his name be forgotten.
