=======================================================
Christopher Eric Hitchens (13 April 1949 – 15 December 2011) was a British-American[2][3] author, polemicist, debater, and journalist.[4] Hitchens contributed to New Statesman, The Nation, The Atlantic, The London Review of Books, The Times Literary Supplement and Vanity Fair. He was the author, co-author, editor and co-editor of over thirty books, including five collections of essays, and concentrated on a range of subjects, including politics, literature and religion. A staple of talk shows and lecture circuits, his confrontational style of debate made him both a lauded and controversial figure. Known for his contrarian stance on a number of issues, he excoriated such public figures as Mother Teresa, Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, Lady Diana, and Pope Benedict XVI. He was the older brother of author Peter Hitchens.
Long describing himself as a socialist, Hitchens began his break from the established political left after what he called the "tepid reaction" of the Western left to the Rushdie Affair, followed by the left's embrace of Bill Clinton, and the "anti-war" movement's opposition to intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina—though Hitchens did not leave his position writing for The Nation until post-9/11, stating that he felt the magazine had arrived at a position "that John Ashcroft is a greater menace than Osama bin Laden."[5] The September 11 attacks "exhilarated" him, bringing into focus "a battle between everything I love and everything I hate," and strengthening his embrace of an interventionist foreign policy which challenged "fascism with an Islamic face".[6] His numerous editorials in support of the Iraq War caused some to label him a neoconservative, although Hitchens insisted he was not "a conservative of any kind", and his friend Ian McEwan described him as representing the anti-totalitarian left.[7][8] Indeed, in a 2010 BBC interview, he stated that he was 'still a Marxist'.[9]
A noted critic of religion and an antitheist, he said that a person "could be an atheist and wish that belief in god were correct", but that "an antitheist, a term I'm trying to get into circulation, is someone who is relieved that there's no evidence for such an assertion."[10] According to Hitchens, the concept of a god or a supreme being is a totalitarian belief that destroys individual freedom, and that free expression and scientific discovery should replace religion as a means of teaching ethics and defining human civilisation. His anti-religion polemic, New York Times Bestseller, God is not Great - How Religion Poisons Everything, sold over 500,000 copies.
Hitchens died on 15 December 2011 from complications arising from oesophageal cancer, a disease that he acknowledged was more than likely due to his lifelong predilection for heavy smoking and drinking.[11]
His parents, Eric Ernest and Yvonne Jean (Hickman) Hitchens, met in Scotland when both were serving in the Royal Navy during World War II.[12] His mother was a "Wren" (a member of the Women's Royal Naval Service),[13] and his father an officer aboard the cruiser HMS Jamaica, which helped sink Nazi Germany's battleship Scharnhorst in the Battle of the North Cape.[14] His father's naval career required the family to move a number of times from base to base throughout Britain and its dependencies, including in Malta, where Christopher's brother Peter was born in Sliema in 1951.
Hitchens's mother, arguing "if there is going to be an upper class in this country, then Christopher is going to be in it",[15] sent him to Mount House School in Tavistock in Devon at the age of eight, followed by the independent Leys School in Cambridge, and finally Balliol College, Oxford, where he was tutored by Steven Lukes and read philosophy, politics, and economics. Hitchens was "bowled over" in his adolescence by Richard Llewellyn's How Green Was My Valley, Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon, Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, R. H. Tawney's critique on Religion and the Rise of Capitalism, and the works of George Orwell.[13] In 1968, he took part in the TV quiz show University Challenge.[16]
In the 1960s, Hitchens joined the political left, drawn by his anger over the Vietnam War, nuclear weapons, racism, and oligarchy, including that of "the unaccountable corporation". He expressed affinity with the politically charged countercultural and protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s. He deplored the recreational drug use of the time, which he described as hedonistic.[17]
He joined the Labour Party in 1965, but along with the majority of the Labour students' organisation was expelled in 1967, because of what Hitchens called "Prime Minister Harold Wilson's contemptible support for the war in Vietnam".[18][clarification needed] Under the influence of Peter Sedgwick, who translated the writings of Russian revolutionary and Soviet dissident Victor Serge, Hitchens forged an ideological interest in Trotskyist and anti-Stalinist socialism.[13] Shortly after he joined "a small but growing post-Trotskyist Luxemburgist sect".[19]
Hitchens began working as a correspondent for the magazine International Socialism,[20] published by the International Socialists, the forerunners of today's British Socialist Workers Party. This group was broadly Trotskyist, but differed from more orthodox Trotskyist groups in its refusal to defend communist states as "workers' states". Their slogan was "Neither Washington nor Moscow but International Socialism".
Hitchens left Oxford with a third class degree.[21] In 1971 he went to work at the Times Higher Education Supplement where he served as a social science correspondent.[4] Hitchens admitted that he hated the position, and was later fired: he recalled, "I sometimes think if I'd been any good at that job, I might still be doing it."[22] Next he was a researcher for ITV's Weekend World.[23] In 1973 he went to work for the New Statesman, where he became friends with the authors Martin Amis and Ian McEwan, among others.[23] At the New Statesman he acquired a reputation as a fierce left-winger, aggressively attacking targets such as Henry Kissinger, the Vietnam War, and the Roman Catholic Church.
In November 1973, Hitchens's mother committed suicide in Athens in a suicide pact with her lover, a former clergyman named Timothy Bryan.[13] They overdosed on sleeping pills in adjoining hotel rooms, and Bryan slashed his wrists in the bathtub. Hitchens flew alone to Athens to recover his mother's body. Hitchens said he thought his mother was pressured into suicide by fear that her husband would learn of her infidelity, as their marriage had been strained and unhappy. Both her children were then independent adults. While in Greece, Hitchens reported on the constitutional crisis of the military junta. It became his first leading article for the New Statesman.[24]
In 1977, unhappy at the New Statesman, Hitchens defected to the Daily Express where he became a foreign correspondent.[23] He returned to the New Statesman in 1979 where he became foreign editor.[23]
Hitchens went to the United States in 1981, as part of an editor exchange program between The New Statesman and The Nation.[25] After joining The Nation, he penned vociferous critiques of Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and American foreign policy in South and Central America.[26][27][28][29][30][31][32] He became a contributing editor of Vanity Fair in 1992,[33] writing ten columns a year. He left The Nation in 2002 after profoundly disagreeing with other contributors over the Iraq War. There is speculation that Hitchens was the inspiration for Tom Wolfe's character Peter Fallow in the 1987 novel The Bonfire of the Vanities,[28] but others—including Hitchens (or he indicated as such while alive)—believe it to be Spy Magazine's "Ironman Nightlife Decathlete" Anthony Haden-Guest.[34][35] In 1987, his father died from cancer of the esophagus; the same disease that would later claim his own life.[36] In April 2007, Hitchens became a U.S. citizen. He became a media fellow at the Hoover Institution in September 2008.[37]
Hitchens spent part of his early career in journalism as a foreign correspondent in Cyprus.[38] Through his work there he met his first wife Eleni Meleagrou, a Greek Cypriot, with whom he had two children, Alexander and Sophia. His son, Alexander Meleagrou-Hitchens, born in 1984, has worked as a policy researcher in London. Hitchens continued writing essay-style correspondence pieces from a variety of locales, including Chad, Uganda[39] and the Darfur region of Sudan.[40] His work took him to over 60 countries.[41] In 1991 he received a Lannan Literary Award for Nonfiction.[42]
Hitchens met Carol Blue for the first time at the Los Angeles airport in 1989, and would marry her in 1991. Hitchens called it love at first sight.[43] In 1999, as harsh critics of Clinton, Hitchens and Carol Blue submitted an affidavit to the trial managers of the Republican Party in the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Therein they swore that their then-friend, Sidney Blumenthal, had described Monica Lewinsky as a stalker. This allegation contradicted Blumenthal's own sworn deposition in the trial,[44] and it resulted in a hostile exchange of opinion in the public sphere between Hitchens and Blumenthal. Following the publication of Blumenthal's The Clinton Wars, Hitchens wrote several pieces in which he accused Blumenthal of manipulating the facts.[44][45] The incident ended their friendship and sparked a "personal crisis" for Hitchens who was stridently criticised by friends for a cynical and ultimately politically futile act.[27]
Before Hitchens's political shift, the American author and polemicist Gore Vidal was apt to speak of Hitchens as his "Dauphin" or "heir".[46][47][48] In 2010, Hitchens attacked Vidal in a Vanity Fair piece headlined "Vidal Loco", calling him a "crackpot" for his adoption of 9/11 conspiracy theories.[49][50] Also, on the back of his book Hitch-22, among the praise from notable figures, Vidal's endorsement of Hitchens as his successor is crossed out in red and an annotated "NO, C.H." His strong advocacy of the war in Iraq had gained Hitchens a wider readership, and in September 2005 he was named one of the "Top 100 Public Intellectuals" by Foreign Policy and Prospect magazines.[51] An online poll ranked the 100 intellectuals, but the magazines noted that the rankings of Hitchens (5), Noam Chomsky (1), and Abdolkarim Soroush (15) were partly due to supporters publicising the vote.[52]
In 2007 Hitchens's work for Vanity Fair won him the National Magazine Award in the category "Columns and Commentary".[53] He was a finalist once more in the same category in 2008 for some of his columns in Slate but lost out to Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stone.[54] He won the National Magazine Award for Columns about Cancer in 2011.[55][56] Hitchens also served on the Advisory Board of Secular Coalition for America and offered advice to Coalition on the acceptance and inclusion of nontheism in American life.[57] In December 2011, prior to his death, Asteroid 57901 Hitchens was named after him.[58]
Hitchens wrote a monthly essay on books in The Atlantic[59] and contributed occasionally to other literary journals. One of his books, Unacknowledged Legislation: Writers in the Public Sphere, is a collection of such works, and Love, Poverty and War contains a section devoted to literary essays. In Why Orwell Matters, he defends Orwell's writings against modern critics as relevant today and progressive for his time. In the 2008 book Christopher Hitchens and His Critics: Terror, Iraq, and the Left, many literary critiques are included of essays and other books of writers, such as David Horowitz and Edward Said.
During a three-hour interview by Book TV,[14] he named authors who have had influence on his views, including Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, Evelyn Waugh, P. G. Wodehouse and Conor Cruise O'Brien.
My own opinion is enough for me, and I claim the right to have it defended against any consensus, any majority, anywhere, anyplace, anytime. And anyone who disagrees with this can pick a number, get in line and kiss my ass.
The San Francisco Chronicle referred to Hitchens as a "gadfly with gusto".[61] In 2009, Hitchens was listed by Forbes magazine as one of the "25 most influential liberals in the U.S. media".[62] The same article noted that he would "likely be aghast to find himself on this list", since it reduces his self-styled radicalism to mere liberalism. Hitchens's political perspective appears in his wide ranging writings, which include many of the political dialogues he published.
In 2010, Theodore Dalrymple wrote, "Christopher made an early commitment to Trotskyism, but it is difficult to take him very seriously as a revolutionary because he always has been too much of a hedonist. Indeed, he appears to me to have had roughly the same relationship to proletarians as Marie Antoinette had to sheep: They have walk-on parts in his personal drama. There is not much evidence of his having thought deeply, or even at all, about the fate, under a social system he vociferously advocated, of the pleasures he so clearly values, the liking for which I don't in the least blame him; nor is there evidence of any real reflection on what the world would have been like had his demands been met. Not permanent revolution but permanent adolescence has been his goal, and I think he has achieved it."[63]
Hitchens became a socialist "largely [as] the outcome of a study of history, taking sides ... in the battles over industrialism and war and empire." In 2001, he told Rhys Southan of Reason magazine that he could no longer say "I am a socialist". Socialists, he claimed, had ceased to offer a positive alternative to the capitalist system. Capitalism had become the more revolutionary economic system, and he welcomed globalisation as "innovative and internationalist", but added, "I don't think that the contradictions, as we used to say, of the system, are by any means all resolved." He stated that he had a renewed interest in the freedom of the individual from the state, but that he still considered libertarianism "ahistorical" both on the world stage and in the work of creating a stable and functional society, adding that libertarians are "more worried about the over-mighty state than the unaccountable corporation" whereas "the present state of affairs ... combines the worst of bureaucracy with the worst of the insurance companies."[64]
In 2006, in a town hall meeting in Pennsylvania debating the Jewish Tradition with Martin Amis, Hitchens commented on his political philosophy by stating, "I am no longer a socialist, but I still am a Marxist".[65] In a June 2010 interview with The New York Times, he stated that "I still think like a Marxist in many ways. I think the materialist conception of history is valid. I consider myself a very conservative Marxist".[66] In 2009, in an article for The Atlantic entitled "The Revenge of Karl Marx", Hitchens frames the late-2000s recession in terms of Marx's economic analysis and notes how much Marx admired the capitalist system that he called for the end of, but says that Marx ultimately failed to grasp how revolutionary capitalist innovation was.[67] Hitchens was an admirer of Che Guevara, yet in an essay written in 1997, he distanced himself from Che, and referred to the mythos surrounding him as a "cult".[68] In 2004 he resumed his positive view of Che, commenting that "[Che's] death meant a lot to me and countless like me at the time. He was a role model, albeit an impossible one for us bourgeois romantics insofar as he went and did what revolutionaries were meant to do—fought and died for his beliefs."[69]
He continued to regard Leon Trotsky and Vladmir Lenin as great men,[70][71] and the October Revolution as a necessary event in the modernisation of Russia.[19][28] In 2005, Hitchens praised Lenin's creation of "secular Russia" and his discrediting of the Russian Orthodox Church, describing it as "an absolute warren of backwardness and evil and superstition".[19]
In the years after the fatwa issued against Salman Rushdie in response to his novel The Satanic Verses, Hitchens became increasingly critical of what he called "excuse making" on the left. At the same time, he was attracted to the foreign policy ideas of some on the Republican-right that promoted pro-liberalism intervention, especially the neoconservative group that included Paul Wolfowitz.[72] Around this time, he befriended the Iraqi dissident and businessman Ahmed Chalabi.[73] In 2004, Hitchens stated that neoconservative support for US intervention in Iraq convinced him that he was "on the same side as the neo-conservatives" when it came to contemporary foreign policy issues.[74] Hitchens had also been known to refer to his association with "temporary neocon allies".[75]
Following the 11 September attacks, Hitchens and Noam Chomsky debated the nature of radical Islam and the proper response to it. In October 2001, Hitchens wrote criticisms of Chomsky in The Nation.[76][77] Chomsky responded[78] and Hitchens issued a rebuttal to Chomsky[79] to which Chomsky again responded.[5] Approximately a year after the 11 September attacks and his exchanges with Chomsky, Hitchens left The Nation, claiming that its editors, readers and contributors considered John Ashcroft a bigger threat than Osama bin Laden,[80] and that they were making excuses on behalf of Islamist terrorism; in the following months he wrote articles increasingly at odds with his colleagues.
Christopher Hitchens argued the case for the Iraq War in a 2003 collection of essays entitled A Long Short War: The Postponed Liberation of Iraq, and he held numerous public debates on the topic with George Galloway[81] and Scott Ritter.[82]
Prior to 11 September 2001, and the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, Hitchens was highly critical of President George W. Bush's "non-interventionist" foreign policy. He also criticised Bush's support of intelligent design[83] and capital punishment.[84]
Although Hitchens defended Bush's post-11 September foreign policy, he criticised the actions of US troops in Abu Ghraib and Haditha, and the US government's use of waterboarding, which he unhesitatingly deemed as torture after he was invited by Vanity Fair to voluntarily undergo it.[85][86] In January 2006, Hitchens joined with four other individuals and four organisations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and Greenpeace, as plaintiffs in a lawsuit, ACLU v. NSA, challenging Bush's warrantless domestic spying program; the lawsuit was filed by the ACLU.[87][88][89]
Hitchens would elaborate on his political views and ideological shift in a discussion with Eric Alterman on Bloggingheads.tv. In this discussion Hitchens revealed himself to be a supporter of Ralph Nader in the 2000 US presidential election, who was disenchanted with the candidacy of both George W. Bush and Al Gore.[90]
Hitchens speaking at a September 2000 third party protest at the headquarters of the Commission on Presidential Debates
Hitchens made a brief return to The Nation just before the 2004 US presidential election and wrote that he was "slightly" for Bush; shortly afterwards, Slate polled its staff on their positions on the candidates and mistakenly printed Hitchens's vote as pro-John Kerry. Hitchens shifted his opinion to "neutral", saying: "It's absurd for liberals to talk as if Kristallnacht is impending with Bush, and it's unwise and indecent for Republicans to equate Kerry with capitulation. There's no one to whom he can surrender, is there? I think that the nature of the jihadist enemy will decide things in the end".[91]
In the 2008 presidential election, Hitchens in an article for Slate stated, "I used to call myself a single-issue voter on the essential question of defending civilisation against its terrorist enemies and their totalitarian protectors, and on that 'issue' I hope I can continue to expose and oppose any ambiguity." He was critical of both main party candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, but wrote that Obama would be the better choice. Hitchens went on to call McCain "senile", and his choice of running mate Sarah Palin "absurd", calling Palin a "pathological liar" and a "national disgrace". Hitchens also wrote that "Obama is greatly overrated" and that the Obama-Biden ticket "show[s] some signs of being able and willing to profit from experience".[92]
Hitchens had said of himself, "I am an Anti-Zionist. I'm one of those people of Jewish descent who believes that Zionism would be a mistake even if there were no Palestinians."[93]
A review of his autobiography Hitch-22 in the Jewish Daily Forward refers to Hitchens "at the time [that he had learned that his grandparents were Jews, he had been] a prominent anti-Zionist" and says that he viewed Zionism "as an injustice against the Palestinians".[94] Others have commented on his anti-Zionism as well[95] suggesting that his memoir was "marred by the occasional eruption of [his] anti-Zionism".[96] At other times for example speaking at 2nd annual Memorial for Daniel Pearl, and in print in an article for The Atlantic he had made comments against the terrorism against Jews in the Middle East. Hitchens stated "But the Jews of the Arab lands were expelled again in revenge for the defeat of Palestinian nationalistic aspirations, in 1947–48, and now the absolute most evil and discredited fabrication of Jew-baiting Christian Europe—The Protocols of the Elders of Zion—is eagerly promulgated in the Hamas charter and on the group's Web site and recycled through a whole nexus of outlets that includes schools as well as state-run television stations".[97]
In Slate magazine, Hitchens pondered the notion that, instead of curing antisemitism through the creation of a Jewish state, "Zionism has only replaced and repositioned"[98] it, saying: "there are three groups of 6 million Jews. The first 6 million live in what the Zionist movement used to call Palestine. The second 6 million live in the United States. The third 6 million are distributed mainly among Russia, France, Britain, and Argentina. Only the first group lives daily in range of missiles that can be (and are) launched by people who hate Jews." Hitchens argued that instead of supporting Zionism, Jews should help "secularise and reform their own societies", believing that unless one is religious, "what the hell are you doing in the greater Jerusalem area in the first place?" Indeed, Hitchens goes so far as to claim that the only justification for Zionism given by Jews is a religious one.[99]
In his 2006 debate with Martin Amis, Hitchens stated that "one must not insult or degrade or humiliate people"[100] and that he "would be opposed to this maltreatment of the Palestinians if it took place on a remote island with no geopolitical implications". Hitchens described Zionism as "an ethno-nationalist quasi-religious ideology" and stated his desire that if possible, he would "re-wind the tape [to] stop Herzl from telling the initial demagogic lie (actually two lies) that a land without a people needs a people without a land".
He continued to say that Zionism "... nonetheless has founded a sort of democratic state which isn't any worse in its practice than many others with equally dubious origins." He stated that settlement in order to achieve security for Israel is "doomed to fail in the worst possible way", and the cessation of this "appallingly racist and messianic delusion" would "confront the internal clerical and chauvinist forces which want to instate a theocracy for Jews". Hitchens contended that the "solution of withdrawal would not satisfy the jihadists" and wondered "What did they imagine would be the response of the followers of the Prophet [Muhammad]?" Hitchens bemoaned the transference into religious terrorism of Arab secularism as a means of democratisation: "the most depressing and wretched spectacle of the past decade, for all those who care about democracy and secularism, has been the degeneration of Palestinian Arab nationalism into the theocratic and thanatocratic hell of Hamas and Islamic Jihad".[98] He maintained that the Israel-Palestine conflict is a "trivial squabble" that has become "so dangerous to all of us" because of "the faith-based element."[100]
Hitchens collaborated on this issue with prominent Palestinian advocate Edward Said, in 1988 publishing Blaming the Victims: Spurious Scholarship and the Palestinian Question.
Hitchens actively supported drug policy reform and called for the abolition of the "War on Drugs" which he described as an "authoritarian war" during a debate with William F. Buckley.[17] He supported the legalisation of cannabis for both medical and recreational purposes, citing it as a cure for glaucoma and as treatment for numerous side-effects induced by chemotherapy, including severe nausea, describing the prohibition of the drug as "sadistic".[101]
Other issues on which Hitchens wrote included his support for the reunification of Ireland,[102][103] abolition of the British monarchy,[104] the establishment of a self-governing state for the Kurdish people[105] and his condemnation of the war crimes of Slobodan Milošević[106] in the Yugoslav Wars, and criticised Franjo Tuđman for colluding with Milošević on a partition of Bosnia and empowering Croatian war criminals.[107]
Hitchens was known for his scathing critiques of public figures. Three figures—Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, and Mother Teresa—were the targets of three separate full length texts, No One Left to Lie To: The Triangulations of William Jefferson Clinton, The Trial of Henry Kissinger, and The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice. Hitchens also wrote book-length biographical essays about Thomas Jefferson (Thomas Jefferson: Author of America), George Orwell (Why Orwell Matters), and Thomas Paine (Thomas Paine's "Rights of Man": A Biography).
The majority of Hitchens's critiques took the form of short opinion pieces, including critiques of: Jerry Falwell,[108][109] George Galloway,[110] Mel Gibson,[111] Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama,[112] Michael Moore,[113] Daniel Pipes,[114] Ronald Reagan,[115] Jesse Helms,[116] and Cindy Sheehan.[19][117] When comedian Bob Hope died in 2003, Hitchens wrote an attack piece on him, calling Hope "a fool and nearly a clown, but he was never even remotely a comedian" and "Quick, then—what is your favorite Bob Hope gag? It wouldn't take you long if I challenged you on Milton Berle, or Woody Allen, or John Cleese, or even Lenny Bruce or Mort Sahl. By this time tomorrow, I bet you haven't come up with a real joke for which Hope could take credit." Critics argued that Hitchens focused solely on Hope's declining years and ignored his heyday in the 1940s.[118]
Hitchens often spoke out against the Abrahamic religions, or what he called "the three great monotheisms" (Judaism, Christianity and Islam). When asked by readers of The Independent (London) what he considered to be the "axis of evil", Hitchens replied "Christianity, Judaism, Islam – the three leading monotheisms."[119] In his book, God Is Not Great, Hitchens expanded his criticism to include all religions, including those rarely criticised by Western secularists such as Buddhism and neo-paganism. His book had mixed reactions, from praise in The New York Times for his "logical flourishes and conundrums"[120] to accusations of "intellectual and moral shabbiness" in the Financial Times.[121] God Is Not Great was nominated for a National Book Award on 10 October 2007.[122][123]
Hitchens contended that organised religion is "the main source of hatred in the world",[124] "[v]iolent, irrational, intolerant, allied to racism, tribalism, and bigotry, invested in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and coercive toward children", and that accordingly it "ought to have a great deal on its conscience". He often spoke about his efforts to champion the word 'antitheist' as he expressed his position that it was a relief that there is no evidence for a 'celestial North Korea'. Atheism was a word not strong enough to encompass his feelings about the immoral conundrum that the existence of a deity would necessarily imply. In God Is Not Great, Hitchens contends that:
[A]bove all, we are in need of a renewed Enlightenment, which will base itself on the proposition that the proper study of mankind is man and woman [referencing Alexander Pope]. This Enlightenment will not need to depend, like its predecessors, on the heroic breakthroughs of a few gifted and exceptionally courageous people. It is within the compass of the average person. The study of literature and poetry, both for its own sake and for the eternal ethical questions with which it deals, can now easily depose the scrutiny of sacred texts that have been found to be corrupt and confected. The pursuit of unfettered scientific inquiry, and the availability of new findings to masses of people by electronic means, will revolutionise our concepts of research and development. Very importantly, the divorce between the sexual life and fear, and the sexual life and disease, and the sexual life and tyranny, can now at last be attempted, on the sole condition that we banish all religions from the discourse. And all this and more is, for the first time in our history, within the reach if not the grasp of everyone.[125]
His book rendered him one of the major advocates of the "New Atheism" movement, and he also was made an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society.[126] Hitchens said he would accept an invitation from any religious leader who wished to debate with him. He also served on the advisory board of the Secular Coalition for America,[127] a lobbying group for atheists and humanists in Washington, DC. In 2007, Hitchens began a series of written debates on the question "Is Christianity Good for the World?" with Christian theologian and pastor, Douglas Wilson, published in Christianity Today magazine.[128] This exchange eventually became a book by the same title in 2008. During their book tour to promote the book, film producer Darren Doane sent a film crew to accompany them. Doane produced the film Collision: Is Christianity GOOD for the World?, which was released on 27 October 2009. On 4 April 2009 Hitchens debated William Lane Craig on the existence of God at Biola University.[129]
On 26 November 2010, Hitchens appeared in Toronto, Canada at the Munk Debates, where he debated religion with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a convert to Roman Catholicism. Blair argued religion is a force for good, while Hitchens was against it. Preliminary results on the Munk website said 56 per cent of the votes backed the proposition (Hitchens's position) before hearing the debate, with 22 per cent against (Blair's position), and 21 per cent undecided, with the undecided voters leaning toward Hitchens, giving him a 68 per cent to 32 per cent victory over Blair, after the debate.[130][131]
In February 2006, Hitchens helped organise a pro-Denmark rally outside the Danish Embassy in Washington, DC in response to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy.[132]
Hitchens was accused by William A. Donohue of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Liberties of being particularly anti-Catholic. Hitchens responded "when religion is attacked in this country ... the Catholic Church comes in for a little more than its fair share".[133] Hitchens had also been accused of anti-Catholic bigotry by others, including Brent Bozell, Tom Piatak in The American Conservative, and UCLA Law Professor Stephen Bainbridge.[134][135] In an interview with Radar in 2007, Hitchens said that if the Christian right's agenda were implemented in the United States "It wouldn't last very long and would, I hope, lead to civil war, which they will lose, but for which it would be a great pleasure to take part."[136] When Joe Scarborough on 12 March 2004 asked Hitchens whether he was "consumed with hatred for conservative Catholics", Hitchens responded that he was not and that he just thinks that "all religious belief is sinister and infantile".[137] Piatak claimed that "A straightforward description of all Hitchens's anti-Catholic outbursts would fill every page in this magazine", noting particularly Hitchens's assertion that US Supreme Court Justice John Roberts should not be confirmed because of his faith.[135]
Hitchens was raised nominally Christian, and went to Christian boarding schools but from an early age declined to participate in communal prayers. Later in life, Hitchens discovered that he was of Jewish descent on his mother's side. According to Hitchens, when his brother Peter took his fiancée to meet their maternal grandmother, who was then in her 90s, she said of his fiancée, "She's Jewish, isn't she?" and then announced: "Well, I've got something to tell you. So are you." Hitchens found out that his maternal grandmother, Dorothy née Levin, was Jewish (Dorothy's father and maternal grandfather had both been born Jewish, and Dorothy's maternal grandmother—Hitchens's matrilineal great-great-grandmother—was a convert to Judaism). Hitchens's maternal grandfather converted to Judaism before marrying Dorothy Levin.[138] Hitchens's Jewish-born ancestors were immigrants from Eastern Europe (including Poland).[139][140] In an article in The Guardian on 14 April 2002, Hitchens stated that he could be considered Jewish because Jewish descent is traditionally traced matrilineally.[139][141] In a 2010 interview at New York Public Library, Hitchens stated that he was against circumcision, a Jewish tradition, and that he believed "if anyone wants to saw off bits of their genitalia they should do it when they're grown up and have made the decision for themselves".[142]
In February 2010, he was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation's Honorary Board of distinguished achievers.[143]
Hitchens was married twice, first to Eleni Meleagrou,[144] a Greek Cypriot, in a Greek Orthodox church[145] in 1981; the couple had a son, Alexander, and a daughter, Sophia. They divorced in 1989. From February 1990, Hitchens's girlfriend was reported as being Carol Blue, a Californian screenwriter.[146] In 1991 Hitchens married Blue[27] in a ceremony held at the apartment of Victor Navasky, editor of The Nation. They had a daughter, Antonia.[27]
Hitchens's father, Eric Hitchens, was a Commander in the British Royal Navy. Hitchens often referred to his father as simply the 'Commander'. On 26 December 1943, Hitchens's father was deployed onboard HMS Jamaica when it sank the German warship, the Scharnhorst. Christopher Hitchens would refer to his father's contribution to the war: 'Sending a Nazi convoy raider to the bottom is a better day's work than any I have ever done.' He also stated that 'the remark that most summed him [his father] up was the flat statement that the war of 1939 to 1945 had been "the only time when I really felt I knew what I was doing."'[147]
Hitchens's mother, Yvonne, died in Athens in 1973 when, despite first reports in The Times that she had been murdered, it was later concluded that her death had been the result of an apparent suicide pact with her boyfriend, Reverend Timothy Bryan. Hitchens travelled to Athens to identify his mother's body. On the subject Hitchens later said: 'She probably thought things were getting sordid—he [Bryan] wasn't able to hold a job down, she couldn't go back, she was probably about the age I am now and perhaps there was that—she'd been very pretty—and things were never going to get any better, so why go through with it? She might not have been that hard to persuade, but I know that she did try to save herself because I have the photographs still. So that was sort of the end of family life really.'[148]
In reference to writing about his mother in his memoir, Hitch-22, he said, 'It was painful to write about my mother, but not very because long ago I internally managed all that. 'I even went back to Greece and I went to the graveyard while I was writing the book and decided not to write about it. I thought that would be sentimental.'[149]
Hitchens's younger brother by one-and-a-half years, Peter Hitchens, is a Christian and socially conservative journalist, although, like his brother, he had been a Trotskyist in the 1970s. The brothers had a protracted falling-out after Peter wrote that Christopher had once joked that he "didn't care if the Red Army watered its horses at Hendon" (a suburb of London).[150] Christopher denied having said this and broke off contact with his brother. He then referred to his brother as "an idiot" in a letter to Commentary, and the dispute spilled into other publications as well. Christopher eventually expressed a willingness to reconcile and to meet his new nephew (born in 1999); shortly thereafter the brothers gave several interviews together in which they said that their personal disagreements had been resolved. They appeared together on 21 June 2007 edition of the BBC current affairs discussion show Question Time. The pair engaged in a formal televised debate for the first time on 3 April 2008, at Grand Valley State University,[151] and at the Pew Forum on 12 October 2010.[152]
In 1999, the brothers debated before an audience (which included Ian McEwan, Salman Rushdie and Billy Bragg) in London, televised on C-SPAN.[153]
The Sunday Times described Hitchens as "Usually armed with a glass of Scotch and an untipped Rothmans cigarette."[154] In late 2007 he briefly gave up smoking, although resumed during the writing of his memoir and continued until his cancer diagnosis.[155] Hitchens admitted to drinking heavily; in 2003 he wrote that his daily intake of alcohol was enough "to kill or stun the average mule", arguing that many great writers "did some of their finest work when blotto, smashed, polluted, shitfaced, squiffy, whiffled, and three sheets to the wind."[156]
George Galloway notably accused Hitchens of being a "drink-sodden ex-Trotskyist popinjay",[157] to which Hitchens replied, "only some of which is true."[158] Hitchens later elaborated: "He says that I am an ex-Trotskyist (true), a 'popinjay' (true enough, since the word's original Webster's definition is a target for arrows and shots), and that I cannot hold a drink (here I must protest)."[159] Hitchens's wife Carol Blue described him as "obviously an alcoholic, he functions at a really high level and he doesn't act like a drunk, so the only reason it's a bad thing is it's taking out his liver, presumably. It would be a drag for Henry Kissinger to live to a hundred and Christopher to keel over next year."[160] His profile in The New Yorker described him as drinking "like a Hemingway character: continually and to no apparent effect."[160]
Oliver Burkeman writes, "Since the parting of ways on Iraq ... Hitchens claims to have detected a new, personalised nastiness in the attacks on him, especially over his fabled consumption of alcohol. He welcomes being attacked as a drinker 'because I always think it's a sign of victory when they move on to the ad hominem.' He drank, he said, 'because it makes other people less boring. I have a great terror of being bored. But I can work with or without it. It takes quite a lot to get me to slur.'"[161]
In his 2010 memoir Hitch-22, Hitchens wrote: "There was a time when I could reckon to outperform all but the most hardened imbibers, but I now drink relatively carefully." He described his then-current drinking routine on working-days as follows: "At about half past midday, a decent slug of Mr. Walker's amber restorative, cut with Perrier water (an ideal delivery system) and no ice. At luncheon, perhaps half a bottle of red wine: not always more but never less. Then back to the desk, and ready to repeat the treatment at the evening meal. No 'after dinner drinks'—most especially nothing sweet and never, ever any brandy. 'Nightcaps' depend on how well the day went, but always the mixture as before. No mixing: no messing around with a gin here and a vodka there."[162]
I always knew there was a risk in the bohemian lifestyle ... I decided to take it because it helped my concentration, it stopped me being bored—it stopped other people being boring. It would make me want to prolong the conversation and enhance the moment. If you ask: would I do it again? I would probably say yes. But I would have quit earlier hoping to get away with the whole thing. I decided all of life is a wager and I'm going to wager on this bit ... In a strange way I don't regret it. It's just impossible for me to picture life without wine, and other things, fueling the company, keeping me reading, energising me. It worked for me. It really did.[163]
In June 2010, Hitchens was on tour in New York promoting his memoirs Hitch-22 when he was taken into emergency care suffering from a severe pericardial effusion and then announced he was postponing his tour to undergo treatment for esophageal cancer.[164][165] He announced that he was undergoing treatment in a Vanity Fair piece entitled "Topic of Cancer".[36] Hitchens said that he recognised the long-term prognosis was far from positive, and that he would be a "very lucky person to live another five years".[166]
During his illness, Hitchens was under the care of Francis Collins and was the subject of Collins' new cancer treatment, which maps out the human genome and selectively targets damaged DNA.[167][168]
In April 2011, Hitchens was forced to cancel an appearance at the American Atheist Convention, and instead sent a letter that stated, "Nothing would have kept me from joining you except the loss of my voice (at least my speaking voice) which in turn is due to a long argument I am currently having with the specter of death." He closed with "And don't keep the faith."[169] The letter also dismissed the notion of a possible deathbed conversion, in which he claimed that "redemption and supernatural deliverance appears even more hollow and artificial to me than it did before."[169]
Hitchens died on 15 December 2011 at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.[170] According to Andrew Sullivan, his last words were "Capitalism, downfall."[171]
Hitchens wrote a book-length work about his last illness, based on his Vanity Fair columns. "Mortality" was published in September 2012.[173][174]
Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Hitchens at the Munk debate on religion, Toronto, November 2010
Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said, "Christopher Hitchens was a complete one-off, an amazing mixture of writer, journalist, polemicist, and unique character. He was fearless in the pursuit of truth and any cause in which he believed. And there was no belief he held that he did not advocate with passion, commitment, and brilliance. He was an extraordinary, compelling and colourful human being whom it was a privilege to know."[175]
Richard Dawkins, British evolutionary biologist at the University of Oxford and a friend of Hitchens, said, "I think he was one of the greatest orators of all time. He was a polymath, a wit, immensely knowledgeable, and a valiant fighter against all tyrants including imaginary supernatural ones."[175]
On 9 October 2012, Hitchens was posthumously given the LennonOno Grant for Peace, accepted by his wife Carol Blue.[176]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Christopher Eric Hitchens (born April 13, 1949) was a British-American author, journalist, and literary critic. He was a columnist at Vanity Fair, The Atlantic, The Nation, Slate, and Free Inquiry.Hitchens is known for his atheism and anti-theism and was a firm believer in the Enlightenment values of secularism, humanism, and reason. Hitchens became a United States citizen on his 58th birthday, April 13, 2007.
      His writing took him to Northern Ireland, Greece, Cyprus, Portugal, Spain and Argentina in the 1970s reporting for The Nation, The New Statesman, and other British publications.
      He left The Nation publication in 2003 after he publicly announced his support of the American invasion of Iraq.
      His family sent him to private schools in Tavistock in Tavistock, Devon, England and Cambridge School in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England. He graduated from Balliol College at Oxford University in Oxford, Oxfordshire, England in 1970.
      He married a Greek Cypriot, Eleni Meleagiou. He is survived by their two children, Alexander Hitchens and Sophia Hitchens; his second wife, Carol Blue Hitchens and their daughter, Antonia Hitchens; and his brother, Peter Hitchens.
      He was summoned to Athens, Greece in 1973 when his mother who left his father had committed suicide with her male partner. In 1987, he learned this mother was Jewish which she concealed from her husband and family.
      At the suggestion of his boss, "Vanity Fair" editor Graydon Carter, Hitchens agreed to undergo the controversial "waterboarding" interrogation procedure for purposes of hands-on research for the magazine. Even though Hitchens was professionally supervised throughout the session and could stop the procedure at any time, he lasted less than 20 seconds before giving the hand-signal to terminate the experiment.
Gore Vidal decided early on to become a European cosmopolitan rather than an "all-American" writer like Norman. So he is almost Jamesian in his fascination with English social niceties.'
      [on Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004)] To describe this film as dishonest and demagogic would almost be to promote those terms to the level of respectability. To describe this film as a piece of crap would be to run the risk of a discourse that would never again rise above the excremental. To describe it as an exercise in facile crowd-pleasing would be too obvious. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a sinister exercise in moral frivolity, crudely disguised as an exercise in seriousness. It is also a spectacle of abject political cowardice masking itself as a demonstration of 'dissenting' bravery.
      Faith is the surrender of the mind; it's the surrender of reason, it's the surrender of the only thing that makes us different from other mammals. It's our need to believe, and to surrender our skepticism and our reason, our yearning to discard that and put all our trust or faith in someone or something, that is the sinister thing to me. Of all the supposed virtues, faith must be the most overrated.
      Europeans think Americans are fat, vulgar, greedy, stupid, ambitious and ignorant and so on. And they've taken as their own, as their representative American, someone (Michael Moore) who actually embodies all of those qualities.
      [on Jerry Falwell] I think it's a pity there isn't a hell for him to go to. The empty life of this ugly little charlatan proves only one thing: that you can get away with the most extraordinary offenses to morality and to truth in this country if you'll just get yourself called Reverend. Who would, even at your network, have invited on such a little toad to tell us that the attacks of September 11th were the result of our sinfulness and were God's punishment if they hadn't got some kind of clerical qualification. People like that should be out in the street, shouting and hollering with a cardboard sign and selling pencils from a cup. The whole consideration of this horrible little person is offensive to very, very many of us who have some regard for truth and for morality and who think that ethics do not require that lies be told to children by evil old men, that we're not told that people who believe like Falwell will be snatched up into heaven - I'm glad to see he skipped the rapture and was found on the floor of his office - while the rest of us go to hell. Lots of people are going to die and are already leading miserable lives because of the nonsense preached by this man.
      The noble title of 'dissent' must be earned rather than claimed. It connotes sacrifice and risk rather than mere disagreement.
      [on learning that he had incurable cancer] In whatever kind of a 'race' life may be, I have very abruptly become a finalist.
      [on Iraq] There are a lot of people who will not be happy, it seems to me, until I am compelled to write a letter to these comrades in Iraq and say: 'Look, guys, it's been real, but I'm going to have to drop you now. The political cost to me is just too high.' Do I see myself doing this? No, I do not!
      [on water boarding or a bikini wax] Very much more frightening though less painful than the bikini wax.
      Writing is what's important to me, and anything that helps me do that--or enhances and prolongs and deepens and sometimes intensifies argument and conversation--is worth it to me. Impossible for me to imagine having my life without go to those parties, without having those late nights, without that second bottle.
      [on believing in God while battling cancer] The entity making such a remark might be a raving, terrified person whose cancer has spread to the brain. I can't guarantee that such an entity wouldn't make such a ridiculous remark, but no one recognizable as myself would ever make such a remark.
      [defending Salman Rushdie during his exile] It was, if I can phrase it like this, a matter of everything I hated versus everything I loved. In the hate column: dictatorship, religion, stupidity, demagogy, censorship, bullying and intimidation. In the love column: literature, irony, humor, the individual, and the defense of free expression.
      At 7 years old, I was precocious enough to watch the news and read the papers, and I can remember October 1956, the simultaneous crisis in Hungary and Suez, very well. And getting a sense that the world was dangerous, a sense that the game was up, that the Empire was over.
      I personally want to 'do' death in the active and not the passive. And to be there to look it in the eye and be doing something when it comes for me.
      [When asked to critique Ayn Rand] I'm invited to be unpleasant at the expense of Ayn Rand and Objectivism. Well, that's easy. Well, they're novels first, as I keep trying to say: there's more morality in a novel by George Elliott than in the four Gospels, or the four of them put together. I care very much about literature as a place where real dilemmas, ethical dilemmas are met and dealt with. So to have novels as transcendentally awful as ATLAS SHRUGGED and THE FOUNTAINHEAD sort of undermines my project.
      Dickens was able to mine this huge resource of London life, becoming the conductor and chronicler like nobody since Shakespeare himself.
      [on the fatwa placed on Salman Rushdie because of his novel 'Satanic Verses'] He made, I will always feel, the ideal protagonist for this drama. If literature and the ironic mind are to be defended to the death, then it is as well to have a superbly literate and ironic individual as the case in point.

For nearly a dozen years, Christopher Hitchens contributed an essay on books each month to The Atlantic. He was the author of more than ten books, including A Long Short War: The Postponed Liberation of Iraq (2003),
  Why Orwell Matters (2002), God Is Not Great (2007), and Hitch-22 (2009). He was a contributing editor to Vanity Fair, and wrote prolifically for American and English periodicals, including The 
  International, The Times Literary Supplement, and The Washington Post. He was also a regular television and radio commentator.
The writings of the martyred socialist Rosa Luxemburg give a plaintive view of history’s paths not taken.
Tony Blair’s memoir reveals him to be neither a cynic nor an innocent, but a man of some principle.
Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall is a service to the history it depicts, and puts the author in the very first rank of historical novelists.
A new memoir by the politician’s wife shows that the pain of infidelity pales in comparison to the loss of a child.
Edward Upward was one of the only writers of the ’30s to deal with Britain’s  elephant in the room—fascism—but his career was forever warped by his communism.
=======================================================
The English American, Christopher Hitchens was a man of many talents. In addition to being a journalist, author and essayist, he also served as a literary critic and columnist for some of the most renowned publications including The Atlantic, Free Inquiry, The Nation, Salon, Slate, Vanity Fair and World Affairs. For forty years, Hitchens’ essays, books and journalistic works contributed to world literature. Christopher Hitchens is mostly remembered for speaking his own mind and writing provocative essays challenging the philosophies of the church and state.
An accomplished man, Hitchens was voted the world’s fifth top public intellectual in a Prospect/Foreign Policy poll. For a long time, Hitchens remained a significant figure featuring with his confrontational style of debate in numerous talk shows on television. In 2008, Hitchens became a media fellow at the Hoover Institution. Always touching controversial subjects and topics, Hitchens never hesitated to voice out his opinions. While he spoke and wrote a lot in admiration of personalities such as Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine and George Orwell, Hitchens also, on the other hand, never hesitate to openly declare his dislike for Mother Teresa, Henry Kissinger, Hillary Clinton and the British Royal family by criticizing them harshly. A self defined radical, a keen political observer and a polemicist, traits that brought him fame along with his linkage to left-wing publications in both Britain and the United States. In 1989, Hitchens began separation from politics in reaction to Ayatollah Khomeini’s demand to murder Salman Rushdie. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, Hitchens strongly supported the United States’ interventionist foreign policy. Although he denied being a conservative, Hitchens had been labeled as a neoconservative following numerous editorials he published in support of the war in Iraq.
Hitchens was a firm believer in the non-existence of God. He was a prominent figure of the New Atheism movement who believed in the philosophical values of enlightenment. Hitchens liked to describe himself as an antitheist, disapproving the concept of God as a supreme being. According to him, this is a totalitarian belief which goes against personal freedom.  Hitchens often proposed that free expression and scientific discovery should replace religion as a means of teaching ethics and defining human civilization. His book, God Is Not Great (2007) clearly suggests all his antitheist views.
Christopher Hitchens was born on April 13, 1949. A young Hitchens  attended the  Mount House School in Tavistock in Devon and also Leys School in Cambridge after which he studied politics, economics and philosophy at  Balliol College in Oxford. Hitchens joined the political left in 1960s and later became a member of the Labour Party in 1965. Five years later, in 1970 began his journalistic career, taking a start from the magazine, International Socialism. In 1981, Hitchen moved to the United States, where he spent the rest of his life. For eight years, Hitchens was married to Eleni Meleagrou, with whom he had two children. His second marriage was with the writer Carol Blue, who remained his wife till Hitchen’s death. The couple had one daughter.
On April 13, 2007, Hitchens’ 58th birthday, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States but also retained his British nationality. While on the tour for his memoir Hitch-22 (2010), Hitchens was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. He died on December 15, 2011 in the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.

Christopher HitchensWriterBorn: 13 April 1949Died: 15 December 2011 (cancer)Birthplace: Portsmouth, EnglandBest known as: The author of God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons EverythingChristopher Hitchens was an English-American intellectual whose stock in trade was writing provocative essays that challenged the the philosophical underpinnings of the state and the (Christian) church. He studied philosophy, politics and economics at Balliol College, Oxford, and graduated in 1970. He began his journalism career in London soon after, with the New Statesman, the Evening Standard and the Daily Express. Hitchens lived in the United States after 1981, and had long relationships with The Nation, Vanity Fair, The Atlantic and Slate, where he built his credibilty as a literary leftist. He made his career with erudite essays on foreign policy, as well as controversial swipes at high-profile personalities such as Henry Kissinger, Mother Teresa and Bill Clinton. After two decades of international reporting and book reviews for solidly left-wing publications, Hitchens irritated many on the left in 2002 and 2003, when he supported U.S. President George W. Bush's overthrow of Iraq's Saddam Hussein. In the post-9/11 world, Hitchens came out swinging against what he considered the Left's weak response to the event, and he uncharacteristically allied himself with the "neoconservatives" who vilified Islamic fundamentalists. His opinions only furthered his lifelong run as a contrarian and gadfly, but even his critics agree that his biting attacks were delivered eloquently. In his last years he ramped up his international reputation as an atheist and religion hater, thanks in large part to his 2007 book, God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything. His other books include The Trial of Henry Kissinger (2001) and Why Orwell Matters (2002).  His memoir Hitch-22 was published in 2010, shortly before he was diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus. He died the next year while being treated at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.Extra credit: Christopher Hitchens was married to Eleni Meleagrou, whom he met in Cyprus, from 1981 until their divorce in 1989. They had two children, Alexander (born 1984) and Sophia (born c. 1989)... In 1989, while Meleagrou was pregnant with Sophia, Hitchens met and fell in love with the writer Carol Blue. They married and remained married until his death. Hitchens and Blue had one daughter, Antonia (born c. 1994)... The British writer Peter Hitchens is the brother of Christopher Hitchens.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC. All rights reserved.More on Christopher Hitchens from Infoplease:

Essayist Christopher Hitchens has led a colorful life, from the tragic death of his mother, his days at Oxford and an infamous encounter with Margaret Thatcher. Host Scott Simon talks to Hitchens about his new memoir, Hitch 22.
Copyright © 2010 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. SCOTT SIMON, host:  A lot of profiles have appeared about Christopher Hitchens this week. A lot of the profilers note all of the most irresistible contradictions. He's been a socialist who found Margaret Thatcher sexy; defender of the war in Iraq; among leftists a supporter of gay rights; among rightists an eloquent atheist who devoutly believes in ideals, not just skepticism. And he is perhaps the most consistently entertaining and original essayist now writing in English - though I haven't read the Danish ones.  Christopher Hitchens has written a memoir, "Hitch 22." We're pleased to join him at this apartment home in Washington, D.C. Thanks so much for letting us be here.  Mr. CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS (Author, "Hitch 22"): Oh, make yourselves at home.  SIMON: Can I get you to talk about your parents first?  Mr. HITCHENS: Yes.  SIMON: Military man and...  Mr. HITCHENS: Yes. My father was, as you say, a lifelong Navy man, so I had this rather morose Tory in my background who was hit off brilliantly, by contrast, by my mother, who I always called Yvonne. And I call her Yvonne in my chapter, because it's a stylish name and because she was a stylish girl.  And her story's a tragic one and it ended tragically, in that having waited I think rather too long, because divorce and separation were extremely frowned upon in that set in those days. She did take up with another man after my brother and I had grown up, and it didn't quite work out. In fact, it didn't work out at all. And they made a decision to put an end to their lives and committed suicide together in Athens.  I think I had a chance to save her and failed to grasp it. She tried to call me from Athens and failed. Though I might have just missed the call by a few minutes, I don't know. But I've always been certain that if she'd heard my voice, she wouldn't have done it. So I've been trying to write my way out of that ever since.  SIMON: You grew up not knowing about your religious identity, your ethnicity.  Mr. HITCHENS: I always knew there was some kind of unspoken family secret but I didn't guess what it was. But yes, my mother came from a Jewish family originating in Poland and didn't want to be, and didn't look as if she was. She could pass. So I didn't really find out until my father was dying many years later  and it's after my mother - and my grandmother, my mother's mother, had outlived them both. And she decided to break the secret to my brother and myself. I was about to be 40.  SIMON: Let me ask you about your days at Oxford and as a student socialist leader. Were you a good socialist?  Mr. HITCHENS: Yeah, I was a very dedicated one. And it was a very exciting time to be in that position because I went to Oxford the end of '67, and so I was there just as the crest of '68 broke.  SIMON: When you were at Oxford, you kind of knew Bill Clinton.  Mr. HITCHENS: I knew the American Rhodes scholars. I don't remember socializing with Clinton at all. I'm told I was in the room on the evening he famously didn't inhale, because young Mr. Clinton is allergic to smoke and doesn't inhale, never has, but he did sure like big brownies and cookies, and I'm told you can get leaf into that stuff. Mainline it that way.  We weren't - we on the hard left despised drugs. We thought that was completely counter-revolutionary and contemptible. It was like religion or something. I mean, you just didn't go for false consolation of that sort.  SIMON: Why did Margaret Thatcher spank you?  Mr. HITCHENS: Well, I think it was because she had read my article in The New Statesmen, the then-socialist opposition magazine in London, in which I had said - contrary to the prevailing view at the time, which was that she was a frumpish suburban housewife of no talent, that I thought she had a great future, and that among other things I thought she had some kind of charisma which was highly sexual.  Anyway, she seemed to know who I was when we were introduced, and became rather flirtatious. And then we got into a fight, picked by me, about Zimbabwe, where as it happens I was right and she was wrong, but never mind. I sort of bowed to acknowledge her point. And then she said - I can still hear it - she said: No, bow lower.  So all volition deserting me, I did bow lower, and then straightened up again. She said: No, no, much lower. So again, I found myself sort of bending right forward. There were witnesses to this, as I say in the book. And all the while she'd been rolling up a parliamentary audit paper. The event - the party where we met was in the House of Lords - and stepped (unintelligible) smacked me right across my bottom.  And then, as I regain the vertical, with some difficulty, she walked away, rolling her hip - I swear it - and looked over her shoulder and said: Naughty boy.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. HITCHENS: And I trudged back across Westminster Bridge to my little dump of an apartment in North London, thinking this woman has definitely got something and it's amazing how people don't see it.  SIMON: Used to be a saying among the left: Death to the fascist insect who preys upon the lifeblood of the people.  Mr. HITCHENS: Indeed.  SIMON: And you not only met the fascist insect but you booked him on a talk show once, didn't you?  Mr. HITCHENS: I discovered while I was working, which I briefly did, mistakenly did, in TV journalism, that Sir Oswald Mosley was in London, his home being Paris. He hadn't lived in England since the end of the war, during which he'd been imprisoned, because during the 1930s he'd been the leader of a group called the British Union of Fascists, and that's called the Black Shirts.  He had Goebbels as best man at his wedding and Hitler as a witness, which I would say is quite extreme. Anyway, the old brute was in town. And I thought we ought really to try and grab him for an interview, and he agreed. So I've shaken the hand of someone who'd shaken Adolph Hitler's hand. And he was very affable off the air, told me some interesting things about the '30s.  As soon as the camera light went on, he absolutely stiffened like an old buzzard and delivered this racist tirade. And I thought, ah, thats interesting. Thats how he managed in the '30s to charm people in the upper crust who never saw this thuggish style that he was doing down in the East End of London.  SIMON: Did you learn anything from that encounter about the way people divide their personality sometimes? Did you discover that you were capable of - I dont want to say duality - but operating in...  Mr. HITCHENS: Oh, indeed. Yes.  SIMON: ...different personalities.  Mr. HITCHENS: I mean I thought of, at one point, entitling the book "Both Sides Now," to describe the various ambivalences and contradictions that I've been faced with, or that I contained: English and American, Anglo-Celtic and Jewish, Marxist and - what shall we say - I've been accused of being this, accused of being a neoconservative and not always thought of it as an insult; internationalist but in a way patriotic; a little bit gay when I was younger, it's not a huge thing, but there's a bit of gay and straight in there as well. I thought I'd better be honest about that.  SIMON: I made a short list of some of the people you openly admire in the book: Jacobo Timerman, Salman Rushdie, Susan Sontag...  Mr. HITCHENS: Yes.  SIMON: What qualities do you think they share?  Mr. HITCHENS: Well, all of them have both moral - all three of those have moral and physical courage. And also, all three of them are very good writers. Jacobo Timerman's book - in case your listeners dont know, he was a Jewish journalist and editor in Argentina who was illegally and secretly imprisoned, and wrote a memoir of his torture called "Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number." I was very proud to be a friend.  Salman Rushdie, I suppose I dont have to explain that to anyone. And with Susan, I was in Bosnia with her at one point and saw her being really remarkably brave, over a long period too, not just a one-off moment. And she was steadily courageous, which is the thing one has to admire.  So these are the sort of people one is fortunate to have met, I think.  SIMON: Yeah. Do you drink as much as people think you do?  Mr. HITCHENS: No.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. HITCHENS: But as I say: Keep bringing the tributes around. What time is it, by the way?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. HITCHENS: It must be getting on for noon.  SIMON: Is there - now that youve completed a memoir of your life, now that it's out there published, do you see that as a marker in your life: before the memoir, after? Do you wonder about being defined about that memoir now?  Mr. HITCHENS: Well, I can say that when I was asked to write it first, I wasnt completely sure I wanted to. But then I became 60, which was more of a serious moment than I had expected it was going to be. And then I happened to have the chance to read about my own death around that time, because of a mistake in a catalog in the National Portrait Gallery in London, which had a picture of me in it but referred to me as the late Christopher Hitchens.  And I can tell you something: Nothing concentrates the mind more than reading about yourself in the past tense. Leopold Bloom in "Ulysses" says you should read your death notices, gives you a new lease on life. And I thought, okay, I think I can - Im getting into the frame of mind where the usual objection, which is isnt it a bit soon, will fall to the obvious objection - well, you can't leave till it's too late. So I didnt want to be memoir-less.  But no, Im hoping that it's only a bump on the road of my evolution into a higher mammal.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. HITCHENS: Or primate.  SIMON: Well, Christopher, thanks so much.  Mr. HITCHENS: Oh, please. It's an honor.  SIMON: Christopher Hitchens, his new memoir: "Hitch 22."  Copyright © 2010 NPR. All rights reserved.
