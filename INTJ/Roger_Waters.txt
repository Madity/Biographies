George Roger Waters (born 6 September 1943) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and composer. In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd with drummer Nick Mason, keyboardist Richard Wright and guitarist, singer and songwriter Syd Barrett. Waters initially served as the group's bassist and co-lead vocalist, but following the departure of Barrett in 1968, he also became their lyricist and conceptual leader.
Pink Floyd subsequently achieved international success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall and The Final Cut. By the early 1980s, they had become one of the most critically acclaimed and best-selling acts in the history of popular music; as of 2013, they have sold more than 250 million albums worldwide, including 74.5 million units sold in the United States. Amid creative differences within the group, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over their intended use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987, and nearly eighteen years had passed before he performed with them again.
Waters' solo career has included three studio albums: The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Radio K.A.O.S. and Amused to Death. In 1990, he staged one of the largest and most extravagant rock concerts in history, The Wall – Live in Berlin, with an official attendance of 200,000. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. That same year he released Ça Ira, an opera in three acts translated from Étienne and Nadine Roda-Gils' libretto about the French Revolution. Later that year, he reunited with Pink Floyd bandmates Mason, Wright and David Gilmour for the Live 8 global awareness event; it was the group's first appearance with Waters since 1981. He has toured extensively as a solo act since 1999 and played The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety for his world tour of 2006–2008. In 2010, he began The Wall Live and in 2011 Gilmour and Mason appeared with him during a performance of the double album in London. As of 2013, the tour is the highest-grossing of all time by a solo artist.
Waters has been married four times; first in 1969 to his childhood sweetheart Judy Trim; they had no children together and divorced in 1975. The following year he married Lady Carolyne Christie; the marriage produced a son, Harry Waters, a musician who has played keyboards with his father's touring band since 2006, and a daughter, India Waters, who has worked as a model. Christie and Waters divorced in 1992, and in 1993, he married Priscilla Phillips. They had one son together, Jack Fletcher, before getting divorced in 2001. In 2012, Waters married actress and filmmaker Laurie Durning.
George Roger Waters was born on 6 September 1943, the younger of two boys, to Mary (née Whyte; 1913-2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1913-1944), in Great Bookham, Surrey.[2] His father, the son of a coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, a devout Christian, and a Communist Party member.[3] In the early years of the Second World War, his father was a conscientious objector who drove an ambulance during the Blitz.[3] He later changed his stance on pacifism and joined the British Army, and as a 2Lt. of the 8th Royal Fusiliers died at Aprilia, between Anzio and Rome in Italy, on 18 February 1944, when Roger was five months old.[4] On 19 February 2014, Waters unveiled a monument to his father and other war casualties there, and was made an honorary citizen of Anzio.[5] Following her husband's death, Mary Waters, also a teacher, moved with her two sons to Cambridge and raised them there.[6] Roger Waters' earliest memory is of the VJ Day celebrations.[7] Mary Waters died in 2009, aged 96.
Waters attended Morley Memorial Junior School in Cambridge and then the Cambridgeshire High School for Boys (now Hills Road Sixth Form College) with Syd Barrett, while his future musical partner, David Gilmour, lived nearby on the city's Mill Road, and attended the Perse School.[8] At 15, Waters was chairman of the Cambridge Youth Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (YCND),[9] having designed its publicity poster and participated in its organisation.[10] Though he was a keen sportsman and a highly regarded member of the high school's cricket and rugby teams,[11] he disliked his educational experience; according to Waters, "I hated every second of it, apart from games. The regime at school was a very oppressive one ... the same kids who are susceptible to bullying by other kids are also susceptible to bullying by the teachers."[12] Whereas Waters knew Barrett and Gilmour from his childhood in Cambridge, he met future Pink Floyd founder members Nick Mason and Richard Wright in London at the Regent Street Polytechnic (later the University of Westminster) school of architecture. Waters enrolled there in 1962, after a series of aptitude tests indicated he was well-suited to that field.[13] He had initially considered a career in mechanical engineering.[14]
By September 1963, Waters and Mason had lost interest in their studies; they had moved into the lower flat of Stanhope Gardens, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the Regent Street Polytechnic.[15] Waters, Mason and Wright first played music together in the autumn of 1963, in a band formed by vocalist Keith Noble and bassist Clive Metcalfe.[16] They usually called themselves Sigma 6, but also used the name the Meggadeaths.[10] Waters played rhythm guitar and Mason played drums, Wright played on any keyboard he could arrange to use, and Noble's sister Sheilagh provided an occasional vocal accompaniment.[17] In the early years the band performed during private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom in the basement of Regent Street Polytechnic.[18]
When Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own group in September 1963, the remaining members asked Barrett and guitar player Bob Klose to join.[19] By January 1964, the group became known as the Abdabs, or the Screaming Abdabs.[20] During the autumn of 1964, the band used the names Leonard's Lodgers, Spectrum Five, and eventually, the Tea Set.[21] Sometime during the autumn of 1965, the Tea Set began calling itself the Pink Floyd Sound, later the Pink Floyd and by early 1966, Pink Floyd.[22]
By early 1966 Barrett was Pink Floyd's front-man, guitarist, and songwriter.[23] He wrote or co-wrote all but one track of their debut LP The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, released in August 1967.[24] Waters contributed the song "Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk" (his first sole writing credit) to the album.[25] By late 1967, Barrett's deteriorating mental health and increasingly erratic behaviour,[26] rendered him "unable or unwilling"[27] to continue in his capacity as Pink Floyd's singer-songwriter and lead guitarist.[24] In early March 1968 Pink Floyd met with managers Peter Jenner and Andrew King of Blackhill Enterprises to discuss the band's future. Barrett agreed to leave Pink Floyd, and the band "agreed to Blackhill's entitlement in perpetuity" regarding "past activities".[28] The band's new manager Steve O'Rourke made a formal announcement about the departure of Barrett and the arrival of David Gilmour in April 1968.[29]

Filling the void left by Barrett's departure in March 1968, Waters began to chart Pink Floyd's artistic direction. He became the principal songwriter, lyricist and co-lead vocalist (along with Gilmour, and at times, Wright), and would remain the band's dominant creative figure until his departure in 1985.[30] He wrote the lyrics to the five Pink Floyd albums preceding his own departure, starting with The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) and ending with The Final Cut (1983), while exerting progressively more creative control over the band and its music. Every Waters studio album since The Dark Side of the Moon has been a concept album.[31] With lyrics written entirely by Waters, The Dark Side of the Moon was one of the most commercially successful rock albums ever. It spent 736 straight weeks on the Billboard 200 chart—until July 1988—and sold over 40 million copies worldwide. It was continuing to sell over 8,000 units every week as of 2005.[32] According to Pink Floyd biographer Glen Povey, Dark Side is the world's second best-selling album, and the United States' 21st best-selling album of all time.[33]
Waters produced thematic ideas that became the impetus for the Pink Floyd concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979)—written largely by Waters—and The Final Cut (1983)—written entirely by Waters.[34] He referred or alluded to the cost of war and the loss of his father throughout his work, from "Corporal Clegg" (A Saucerful of Secrets, 1968) and "Free Four" (Obscured by Clouds, 1972) to "Us and Them" from The Dark Side of the Moon, "When the Tigers Broke Free", first used in the feature film, The Wall (1982), later included with "The Fletcher Memorial Home" on The Final Cut, an album dedicated to his father.[35] The theme and composition of The Wall was influenced by his upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the Second World War.[36]
I think things like "Comfortably Numb" were the last embers of mine and Roger's ability to work collaboratively together.[37]
The double album The Wall was written almost entirely by Waters and is largely based on his life story,[38] and having sold over 23 million RIAA certified units in the US as of 2013, is one of the top three best-selling albums of all time in America, according to RIAA.[39] Pink Floyd hired Bob Ezrin to co-produce the album, and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe to illustrate the album's sleeve art.[40] The band embarked on The Wall Tour of Los Angeles, New York, London, and Dortmund. The last band performance of The Wall was on 16 June 1981, at Earls Court London, and this was Pink Floyd's last appearance with Waters until the band's brief reunion at 2 July 2005 Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, 24 years later.[41]
In March 1983, the last Waters–Gilmour–Mason collaboration, The Final Cut, was released. The album was subtitled: "A requiem for the post-war dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd".[42] Waters wrote all the album's lyrics as well as the music. His lyrics were critical of the Conservative Party government of the day and mention Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher by name.[43] At the time Gilmour did not have any new material, so he asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused.[44] According to Mason, after power struggles within the band and creative arguments about the album, Gilmour's name "disappeared" from the production credits, though he retained his pay.[45] Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder describing it as "a superlative achievement" and "art rock's crowning masterpiece".[46] Loder viewed the work as "essentially a Roger Waters solo album".[47]
Amidst creative differences within the group, Waters left Pink Floyd in 1985, and began a legal battle with the remaining band members regarding their continued use of the name and material.[48] In December 1985, Waters "issued a statement to EMI and CBS invoking the 'Leaving Member' clause" on his contract. In October 1986, he initiated High Court proceedings to formally dissolve the Pink Floyd partnership. In his submission to the High Court he called Pink Floyd a "spent force creatively".[49] Gilmour and Mason opposed the application and announced their intention to continue as Pink Floyd. Waters claims to have been forced to resign much like Wright some years earlier, and he decided to leave Pink Floyd based on legal considerations, stating " ... because, if I hadn't, the financial repercussions would have wiped me out completely."[50] In December 1987, an agreement between Waters and Pink Floyd was reached.[48] According to Mason:
We eventually formalised a settlement with Roger. On Christmas Eve, 1987, ... David and Roger convened for a summit meeting on the houseboat [the Astoria] with Jerome Walton, David's accountant. Jerome painstakingly typed out the bones of a settlement. Essentially—although there was far more complex detail—the arrangement allowed Roger to be freed from his arrangement with Steve [O'Rourke], and David and me to continue working under the name Pink Floyd. In the end the court accepted Jerome's version as the final and binding document and duly stamped it.[51]
Waters was released from his contractual obligation with O'Rourke, and he retained the copyrights to The Wall concept and his trademarked inflatable pig.[52] The Gilmour-led Pink Floyd released two studio albums: A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987), and The Division Bell (1994). As of 2013, it is estimated that Pink Floyd have sold over 250 million albums worldwide, including 74.5 million RIAA certified units sold in the US.[53]
Following the release of The Final Cut, Waters embarked on a solo career that produced three concept albums and a movie soundtrack. In 1984, he released his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, a project about a man's dreams across one night that dealt with Waters' feelings about monogamy and family life versus "the call of the wild".[54] In the end the character, Reg, chooses love and matrimony over promiscuity. The album featured guitarist Eric Clapton, jazz saxophonist David Sanborn, and artwork by Gerald Scarfe.[54] Kurt Loder described The Pros And Cons of Hitch Hiking as a "strangely static, faintly hideous record".[55] Rolling Stone rated the album a "rock bottom" one star."[54] Years later, Mike DeGagne of Allmusic praised the album for its, "ingenious symbolism" and "brilliant use of stream of consciousness within a subconscious realm", rating it four out of five stars.[56] Waters began touring in support of the new album, aided by Clapton, a new band, new material, and a selection of Pink Floyd favourites. Waters débuted his tour in Stockholm on 16 June 1984. Poor ticket sales plagued the tour, and some of the larger venues had to be cancelled.[57] By his own estimate, he lost £400,000 on the tour.[58] In March 1985, Waters went to North America to play smaller venues with the Pros and Cons Plus Some Old Pink Floyd Stuff — North America Tour 1985. The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking has been certified Gold by the RIAA.[59]
In 1986, Waters contributed songs and a score to the soundtrack of the animated movie When the Wind Blows, based on the Raymond Briggs book of the same name. His backing band featuring Paul Carrack was credited as The Bleeding Heart Band.[60] In 1987, Waters released Radio K.A.O.S., a concept album based on a mute man named Billy from an impoverished Welsh mining town who has the ability to physically tune into radio waves in his head. Billy first learns to communicate with a radio DJ, and eventually to control the world's computers. Angry at the state of the world in which he lives, he simulates a nuclear attack. Waters followed the release with a supporting tour also in 1987.[61]
In November 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, and in July 1990 Waters staged one of the largest and most elaborate rock concerts in history,[62] The Wall – Live in Berlin, on the vacant terrain between Potsdamer Platz and the Brandenburg Gate. The show reported an official attendance of 200,000, though some estimates are as much as twice that, with approximately one billion television viewers.[63] Leonard Cheshire asked him to do the concert to raise funds for charity. Waters' group of musicians included Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Cyndi Lauper, Bryan Adams, Scorpions, and Sinéad O'Connor. Waters also used an East German symphony orchestra and choir, a Soviet marching band, and a pair of helicopters from the US 7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron. Designed by Mark Fisher, the Wall was 25 metres tall and 170 metres long and was built across the set. Scarfe's inflatable puppets were recreated on an enlarged scale, and although many rock icons received invitations to the show, Gilmour, Mason, and Wright, did not.[64] Waters released a concert double album of the performance which has been certified platinum by the RIAA.[59]
In 1990, Waters hired manager Mark Fenwick and left EMI for a worldwide deal with Columbia. He released his third studio album, Amused to Death, in 1992. The record is heavily influenced by the events of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the Gulf War, and a critique of the notion of war becoming the subject of entertainment, particularly on television. The title was derived from the book Amusing Ourselves to Death by Neil Postman. Patrick Leonard, who worked on A Momentary Lapse of Reason, co-produced the album. Jeff Beck played lead guitar on many of the album's tracks, which were recorded with an impressive cast of musicians at ten different recording studios.[65] It is Waters' most critically acclaimed solo recording, garnering some comparison to his previous work with Pink Floyd.[66] Waters described the record as, a "stunning piece of work", ranking the album with Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall as one of the best of his career.[67] The album had one hit, the song "What God Wants, Pt. 1", which reached number 35 in the UK in September 1992 and number 5 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the US.[68] Amused to Death was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry.[69] Sales of Amused to Death topped out at around one million and there was no tour in support of the album. Waters would first perform material from it seven years later during his In the Flesh tour.[70] In 1996, Waters was inducted into the US and UK Rock and Roll Halls of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd.[71]
In 1999, after a 12-year hiatus from touring, and a seven-year absence from the music industry, Waters embarked on the In the Flesh tour, performing both solo and Pink Floyd material. The tour was a financial success in the US and though Waters had booked mostly smaller venues, tickets sold so well that many of the concerts were upgraded to larger ones.[72] The tour eventually stretched across the world and would span three years. A concert film was released on CD and DVD, named In the Flesh – Live. During the tour, he played two new songs "Flickering Flame" and "Each Small Candle" as the final encore to many of the shows. In June 2002, he completed the tour with a performance in front of 70,000 people at the Glastonbury Festival of Performing Arts, playing 15 Pink Floyd songs and five songs from his solo catalogue.[72]
Miramax announced in mid-2004 that a production of The Wall was to appear on Broadway with Waters playing a prominent role in the creative direction. Reports stated that the musical contained not only the original tracks from The Wall, but also songs from Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and other Pink Floyd albums, as well as new material.[73] On the night of 1 May 2004, recorded extracts from the opera, including its overture, were played on the occasion of the Welcome Europe celebrations in the accession country of Malta. Gert Hof mixed recorded excerpts from the opera into a continuous piece of music which was played as an accompaniment to a large light and fireworks display over Grand Harbour in Valletta.[74] In July 2004, Waters released two new tracks on the Internet: "To Kill the Child", inspired by the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and "Leaving Beirut", an anti-war song "inspired by his travels in the Middle East as a teenager".[75]

In July 2005, Waters reunited with Mason, Wright, and Gilmour for what would be their final performance together at the 2005 Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, Pink Floyd's only appearance with Waters since their final performance of The Wall at Earls Court London 24 years earlier.[76] They played a 23-minute set consisting of "Speak to Me/Breathe"/"Breathe (Reprise)", "Money", "Wish You Were Here", and "Comfortably Numb". Waters told the Associated Press that while the experience of playing with Pink Floyd again was positive, the chances of a bona fide reunion would be "slight" considering his and Gilmour's continuing musical and ideological differences.[77] Though Waters had differing ideas about which songs they should play, he "agreed to roll over for one night only",[78] Gilmour told the Associated Press, "The rehearsals convinced me it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just that ... I've been there, I've done it."[79] In November 2005, Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend of the Who.[80]
In September 2005, Waters released Ça Ira (pronounced [sa iˈʁa], French for "it will be fine"; Waters added the subtitle, "There is Hope"), an opera in three acts translated from the late Étienne Roda-Gil's French libretto based on the historical subject of the French Revolution.[81] Ça Ira was released as a double CD album, featuring baritone Bryn Terfel, soprano Ying Huang and tenor Paul Groves.[82] Set during the early French Revolution, the original libretto was co-written in French by Roda-Gil and his wife Nadine Delahaye. Waters had begun rewriting the libretto in English in 1989,[83] and said about the composition: "I've always been a big fan of Beethoven's choral music, Berlioz and Borodin ... This is unashamedly romantic and resides in that early 19th-century tradition, because that's where my tastes lie in classical and choral music."[84] Waters appeared on television to discuss the opera, but the interviews often focused instead on his relationship with Pink Floyd, something Waters would "take in stride", a sign Pink Floyd biographer Mark Blake believes to be, "a testament to his mellower old age or twenty years of dedicated psychotherapy".[84] Ça Ira reached number 5 on the Billboard Classical Music Chart in the United States.[85]
In June 2006, Waters commenced The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour, a two-year, world-spanning effort that began in Europe in June and North America in September. The first half of the show featured both Pink Floyd songs and Waters' solo material, while the second half included a complete live performance of the 1973 Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon, the first time in over three decades that Waters had performed the album. The shows ended with an encore from the third side of The Wall. He utilised elaborate staging by concert lighting designer Marc Brickman complete with laser lights, fog machines, pyrotechnics, psychedelic projections, and inflatable floating puppets (Spaceman and Pig) controlled by a "handler" dressed as a butcher, and a full 360-degree quadraphonic sound system was used. Nick Mason joined Waters for The Dark Side of the Moon set and the encores on select 2006 tour dates.[86] Waters continued touring in January 2007 in Australia and New Zealand, then Asia, Europe, South America, and back to North America in June.
In March 2007, the Waters song, "Hello (I Love You)" was featured in the science fiction film The Last Mimzy. The song plays over the film's end credits. He released it as a single, on CD and via download, and described it as, "a song that captures the themes of the movie, the clash between humanity's best and worst instincts, and how a child's innocence can win the day".[87] He performed at California's Coachella Festival in April 2008 and was to be among the headlining artists performing at Live Earth 2008 in Mumbai, India in December 2008,[88] but that concert was cancelled in light of the 26 November terrorist attacks in Mumbai.[89]
Waters confirmed the possibility of an upcoming solo album which "might be called" Heartland, and has said he has numerous songs written (some already recorded) that he intends to release when they are a complete album.[90] In June 2010, Waters released a cover of "We Shall Overcome", a protest song rewritten and arranged by Guy Carawan and Pete Seeger at the Highlander Folk School possibly derived either from the refrain of a gospel hymn published by Charles Albert Tindley in 1901, but more likely from Louise Shropshire's hymn, "If My Jesus Wills." He performed with David Gilmour at the Hoping Foundation Benefit Evening in July 2010.[91] The four-song set included: "To Know Him Is to Love Him", which was played in early Pink Floyd sound checks, followed by "Wish You Were Here", "Comfortably Numb", and "Another Brick in the Wall (Part Two)".[92]
In September 2010, Waters commenced The Wall Live tour, an updated version of the original Pink Floyd shows, featuring a complete performance of The Wall.[93] According to Cole Moreton of the Daily Mail, "The touring version of Pink Floyd's The Wall is one of the most ambitious and complex rock shows ever ...",[94] and it is estimated that the tour cost £37 million to stage.[94] Waters told the Associated Press that The Wall Tour will likely be his last, stating: "I'm not as young as I used to be. I'm not like B.B. King, or Muddy Waters. I'm not a great vocalist or a great instrumentalist or whatever, but I still have the fire in my belly, and I have something to say. I have a swan song in me and I think this will probably be it."[95] At The O2 Arena in London on 12 May 2011, Gilmour and Mason once again appeared with Waters and Gilmour performing "Comfortably Numb", and Gilmour and Mason joining Waters for "Outside the Wall".[96] For the first half of 2012, Waters' tour topped worldwide concert ticket sales having sold more than 1.4 million tickets globally.[97] As of 2013, The Wall Live is the highest-grossing tour of all time by a solo artist.[98] Waters performed at the Concert for Sandy Relief at Madison Square Garden on 12 December 2012.[99]
In 1969, Waters married his childhood sweetheart Judy Trim, a successful potter; she was featured on the gatefold sleeve of the original release of Ummagumma, but excised from subsequent CD reissues.[100] They had no children together and divorced in 1975.[101] Trim died in 2001.[102]
In 1976, Waters married Lady Carolyne Christie, the niece of the 3rd Marquess of Zetland.[101] His marriage to Christie produced a son, Harry Waters, a musician who has played keyboards with his father's touring band since 2006, and a daughter, India Waters, who has worked as a model.[103] Christie and Waters divorced in 1992.[101] In 1993, he married Priscilla Phillips; they had one son together, Jack Fletcher. Their marriage ended in 2001.[104] In 2004, he became engaged to actress and filmmaker Laurie Durning; the two married on 14 January 2012.[105]
After the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and subsequent tsunami disaster, Waters performed "Wish You Were Here" with Eric Clapton during a benefit concert on the American network NBC.[106] He was outspoken against the Hunting Act of 2004, and performed a concert for, and attended marches supporting, the Countryside Alliance. Waters explained:
I've become disenchanted with the political and philosophical atmosphere in England. The anti-hunting bill was enough for me to leave England. I did what I could, I did a concert and one or two articles, but it made me feel ashamed to be English. I was in Hyde Park for both the Countryside Alliance marches. There were hundreds of thousands of us there. Good, honest English people. That's one of the most divisive pieces of legislation we've ever had in Great Britain. It's not a case of whether or not I agree with fox hunting, but I will defend to the hilt their right to take part in it.[75]
In October 2005, he clarified: "I come back to the UK quite often. I didn't leave as a protest against the hunting ban; I was following a child in the wake of a divorce."[107] After leaving Britain, he moved to Long Island in New York with his fiancé Laurie Durning.[108] In June 2007, Waters became a spokesman for Millennium Promise, a non-profit organisation that helps fight extreme poverty and malaria. He wrote an opinion piece for CNN in support of the topic.[109] In July, he participated in the American leg of the Live Earth concert, an international multi-venue concert aimed at raising awareness about global climate change, featuring the Trenton Youth Choir and his trademarked inflatable pig. Waters told David Fricke why he thinks The Wall is still relevant today:
The loss of a father is the central prop on which [The Wall] stands. As the years go by, children lose their fathers again and again, for nothing. You see it now with all these fathers, good men and true, who lost their lives and limbs in Iraq for no reason at all. I've done Bring The Boys Back Home in my encore on recent tours. It feels more relevant and poignant to be singing that song now than it did in 1979.[110]
In 2012, Waters led a benefit for United States military veterans called Stand Up for Heroes. He invited a music group of combat wounded veterans called MusiCorps to perform with him.[111] In June 2013, Waters and numerous other celebrities appeared in a video showing support for Bradley Manning.[112]
Waters has been outspoken about Middle Eastern politics, and in June 2009 he openly opposed the Israeli West Bank barrier, calling it an "obscenity [that] should be torn down".[113] Later that year, he pledged his support to the Gaza Freedom March, and in 2011 he announced that he had joined the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel.[114] Waters spoke about his support for BDS, stating that he has "been very disillusioned with UK foreign policy ... since Wilson. It was such a political turnabout from Keir Hardie and Attlee and the principles of British socialism."[115]
In October 2010, after an animated B52 bomber had been been shown dropping symbols including the Star of David as part of The Wall Live tour, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) attacked Waters, saying that he had used "imagery long associated with steretotypes about Jews and money" and had "cross[ed] the line into anti-Semitism." In response, he wrote an open letter to The Independent in which he commented: "If I don't respond, people will see the story and will come to believe I'm anti-Semitic, and I'm not. Nothing could be further from the truth."[116] He explained that the artwork used during his shows is "representative of religious and national and commercial interests, all of which have a malign influence on our lives and prevent us from treating each other decently".[116] He added: "You can attack Israeli policy without being anti-Jewish ... It's like saying if you criticise the US policy you are being anti-Christian. I'm critical of the Israeli policy of occupying Palestinian land and their policy of building settlements, which is entirely illegal under international law, and also of ghettoising the people whose land they are building on ... It's that foreign policy I'm against. It's nothing to do with the religion."[116]
In March 2013, during an interview with Electronic Intifada, Waters stated that the American media "was under instructions from somewhere not to report [criticism of Israel] to the American public, on what grounds I cannot guess."[117]
On 20 July 2013, during a concert in Belgium, Waters' road crew released a pig-shaped balloon that had been painted with symbols including a Star of David, other political symbols shown including representing fascist, communist and capitalist representations. As the balloon floated over the audience, Waters sang the lyrics to "In the Flesh": "get him up against the wall, that one looks Jewish and that one's a coon, who let all of this riff-raff into the room" while holding "a machine gun replica and wearing a long black leather jacket with a red-and-white arm band reminiscent of a Nazi uniform."[118][119] Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center attacked him: "Waters deployed a classic disgusting medieval anti-Semitic caricature widely used by both Nazi and Soviet propaganda to incite hatred against Jews."[120] Waters responded to the accusations, characterizing Cooper's statement as "wild and bigoted" with an "entirely predictable resulting rant."[121] Waters commented: "I should point out that in the show, I also use the Crucifix, the Crescent and Star, the Hammer and Sickle, the Shell Oil Logo and the McDonald’s Sign, a Dollar Sign and a Mercedes sign."[121] Waters explained that his father had died fighting Nazis and that he grew up in post-war England, receiving an in-depth education about the war: "I was spared no horrific detail of the heinous crimes committed in the name of that most foul ideology."[121] Waters stated that the Wall Show: "is many things. It is thoughtful, life affirming, ecumenical, humane, loving, anti-war, anti-colonial, pro-universal access to the law, pro-liberty, pro-collaboration, pro-dialogue, pro-peace, anti-authoritarian, anti-fascist, anti-apartheid, anti-dogma, international in spirit, musical and satirical. It is not anti-Semitic or pro-Nazi."[122] Waters clarified his position regarding the use of religious imagery: "the Star of David represents Israel and its policies and is legitimately subject to any and all forms of non violent protest."[121] Waters stated that the pig balloon represents "the evil of errant government."[121] He added: "For the sake of some perspective. The inflatable pig ... has appeared at every Wall Show since September 2010, some 193 shows [and] yours is the first complaint."[122]
During a December 2013 interview in CounterPunch magazine, Waters made statements urging musicians to boycott Israel in response to their continued occupation of Palestine. He compared Israeli domestic policies with those of Nazi Germany, stating: "the parallels with what went on in the 30's in Germany are so crushingly obvious".[123] In response, author Rabbi Shmuley Boteach accused Waters of anti-Semitism.[124] Waters defended himself, pointing out that he was not criticising Jews or Israelis in general, but the actions of the Israeli state against the Palestinians.[125]
Waters' primary instrument in Pink Floyd was the electric bass guitar. He briefly played a Höfner bass but replaced it with a Rickenbacker RM-1999/4001S, until 1970 when it was stolen along with the rest of the band's equipment in New Orleans.[20] He began using Fender Precision Basses in 1968, originally alongside the Rickenbacker, and then exclusively after the Rickenbacker was lost in 1970. First seen at a concert in Hyde Park, London in July 1970, the black P-Bass was rarely used until April 1972 when it became his main stage guitar and as of 2 October 2010, the basis for a Fender Artist Signature model.[126] Waters endorses RotoSound Jazz Bass 77 flat-wound strings.[127] Throughout his career he has used Selmer, WEM, Hiwatt and Ashdown amplifiers but has used Ampeg for the last few tours, also employing delay, tremolo, chorus, stereo panning and phaser effects in his bass playing.[128]
Waters experimented with the EMS Synthi A and VCS 3 synthesisers on Pink Floyd pieces such as "On the Run",[129] "Welcome to the Machine",[130] and "In the Flesh?"[131] He played electric and acoustic guitar on Pink Floyd tracks using Fender, Martin, Ovation and Washburn guitars.[128] He played electric guitar on the Pink Floyd song "Sheep", from Animals,[132] and acoustic guitar on several Pink Floyd recordings, such as "Pigs on the Wing 1 & 2", also from Animals,[133] "Southampton Dock" from The Final Cut,[134] and on "Mother" from The Wall.[135] A Binson Echorec 2 echo effect was used on his bass-guitar lead track "One of These Days".[136] Waters plays clarinet during concert performances of "Outside the Wall".[137]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Roger Waters was born on September 6, 1943 in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England as George Roger Waters. He was previously married to Pricilla Phillips, Carolyn Christie and Judy Trim.
      After leaving Pink Floyd, he sued, unsuccessfully, to prevent the remaining members from using the name.
      Father Eric Fletcher Waters was killed in World War II in 1944 in Anzio, Italy. His death proved to be a huge inspiration on Pink Floyd's music, particularly on the albums "The Wall" (1979) and "The Final Cut" (1983).
      Has been married three times, first to Judy Trim from 1969-1975 (she appears in a photo in some versions of the Pink Floyd album Ummagumma, credited as "Jude"), then to Carolyne Christie from 1976-1992, with whom he has two children, son Harry and daughter India, and finally to Priscilla Phillips from 1992-2001, with whom he has one child. His daughter India is a model, and son Harry tours with his dad as a keyboard player.
Pink Floyd's album, "A Saucerful of Secrets", is featured on the sleeve of rock band Marillion's album, "Script for a Jester's Tear" (released in 1983).
Pink Floyd's album, "The Wall", is featured on the sleeve of Marillion's album, "Fugazi" (released in 1984).
      His 1987 solo album "Radio K.A.O.S." came 24th on Classic Rock Magazine's list of the 30 greatest concept albums of all time. [March 2003]
Pink Floyd's 1973 album, "Dark Side of the Moon", topped Classic Rock Magazine's list of the 30 greatest concept albums of all time. Their 1979 album, "The Wall", came tenth and their 1983 album, "The Final Cut", came 21st on the list. [March 2003]
      Attended the Regent Street Polytechnic School of Architecture, where he met fellow band mates Richard Wright, and Nick Mason.
      Is a huge fan of John Lennon, and cites "Isolation" as one of his favorite songs of all time. He played on a Lennon tribute show in 1985 performing "Across the Universe" with bassist Andy Fairweather Low.
      Is partially tone-deaf. Uses earpieces in concert to help him sing. When he was in Pink Floyd, he used to have his bass guitars tuned by keyboardist Rick Wright.
Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame for their outstanding contribution to British music and integral part of British music culture. (16 November 2005).
      Worldwide tour of his Pink Floyd epic, The Wall, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the album. [September 2010]
      Reunited with Pink Floyd to play at Live 8 in Hyde Park, London, hosted by Bob Geldof. [June 2005]
      Worldwide tour of his Pink Floyd classic Dark Side of the Moon. The second set of each concert consisted of playing the album in its entirety. Pink Floyd drummer and former bandmate 'Nick Mason' played in some shows. [February 2006]
      In addition to his recent 'In the Flesh' tour, Waters is working on songs for a new concept album, as well as an opera to be based on the French Revolution. He began writing songs for the opera in 1989, but put the project on hold the following year. He got back to working on it in 1998, and says it will be completed "early in the millennium." [August 2002]
      I think there are things in my story that have helped my creativity. Your father being killed, for instance, is one of the best things that could happen to a kid if he's going to write poetry or songs.
      [talking about his former band members in Pink Floyd in 2002, and why he had left Pink Floyd in 1985] "I knew that we were over with, as far as the traditional 'band of brothers' notion of a rock group goes. I mean, we just weren't like that any more and we were never going to be like that again ..."
      You take the risk of being rejected. If you have pretentions to be an artist of any kind, you have to take the risk of people rejecting you and thinking you're an arsehole.
      When I first got a guitar, it was a Spanish, classical thing. I took a few lessons from a woman in Cambridge who used to keep her guitar in her bed, as if it was a sexual thing.
      The loss of a father is the central prop upon which (The Wall) stands. As the years go by, children lose their fathers again and again, for nothing. You see it now with all of these fathers, good men and true, who lost their lives and limbs in Iraq for no reason at all. I've done Bring the Boys Back Home in my encores on recent tours. It feels more relevant and poignant to be singing that song now than it did in 1979.
      My view is certainly that it saved Margaret Thatcher's political career at the time at the cost of a great many Argentine and British lives which disgusted me then and still does now. But I was never a huge fan of Margaret Thatcher and her policies. (On the Falklands War in 1982, the inspiration for Pink Floyd's album "The Final Cut")
=======================================================
The co-founder and longtime member of Pink Floyd, who guided the band creatively during the 1970s and experimented with a solo career afterwards.
=======================================================
Although his father Eric Fletcher Waters had been a communist and ardent pacifist, he fought in World War II and died in action at Anzio in 1944, when Waters was only five months old. Waters would refer or allude to the loss of his father throughout his work, from “Corporal Clegg” (A Saucerful Of Secrets, 1968), through “Free Four” (Obscured By Clouds, 1972) and the sombre “When the Tigers Broke Free”, first used in the movie version of The Wall.
Another reference to the loss of his father appears in “Three Wishes” from Amused To Death (1992), with the line, “I wish when I was young, my old man had not been gone”.
Distrust of authority, particularly government, educational, religious and military institutions, is a recurring theme in Waters’ writing, and this is perhaps best evidenced in 1979′s “The Wall” and 1983′s The Final Cut (the latter album, pointedly, is dedicated to his father’s memory).
He and Syd Barrett attended the Morley Memorial Junior School on Hills Road, Cambridge, and later both attended the Cambridge County School for Boys (now Hills Road Sixth Form College), while fellow band member David Gilmour attended The Perse School on the same road. He met Nick Mason and Rick Wright while attending the Regent Street Polytechnic school of architecture. He was a keen sportsman and was fond of swimming in the River Cam at Grantchester Meadows. At 15 he was chair of YCND in Cambridge.
In 1965, Roger Waters co-founded Pink Floyd (after many different incarnationsā€”see Pink Floyd) along with Syd Barrett, Richard Wright and Nick Mason. Although Barrett initially did most of the songwriting for the band, Waters wrote the song “Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk” on their debut LP, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. The album was a critical success and positioned the band for stardom. Barrett’s deteriorating mental health led to increasingly erratic behaviour, rendering him unable to continue in his capacity as Pink Floyd’s lead singer and guitarist. Waters attempted to coerce his friend into psychiatric treatment; this proved unhelpful, and the band approached David Gilmour to replace Barrett at the end of 1967. Even the band’s former managers felt that Pink Floyd would not be able to sustain its initial success without the talented Barrett. Filling the void left by Barrett’s departure, Waters began to chart Pink Floyd’s new artistic direction. The lineup with Gilmour and Waters eventually brought Pink Floyd to prominence, producing a series of albums in the 1970s that remain among the most critically acclaimed and best-selling records of all time.
In 1970, Waters collaborated with British composer Ron Geesin (who co-wrote Pink Floyd’s title suite from Atom Heart Mother) on a soundtrack album, Music from “The Body”, which consisted mostly of instrumentals interspersed with songs composed by Waters. Within Pink Floyd, Waters became the main lyrical contributor, exerting progressively more creative control over the band: he produced thematic ideas that became the impetus for concept albums such as The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here, for which he wrote all of the lyrics and some of the music. After this, Waters became the primary songwriter, composing Animals and The Wall largely by himself (though continuing to collaborate with Gilmour on a few tracks).
Waters’ band-mates were happy to allow him to write the band’s lyrics and guide its conceptual direction while they shared the opportunity to contribute musical ideas (Gilmour described Waters as “a very good motivator and obviously a great lyricist,” even at the height of the acrimony between them in 1995). Some of the band’s most popular and beloved songs, including “Echoes”, “Time”, “Us and Them”, “Wish You Were Here” and “Shine On You Crazy Diamond”, feature the strong synergy of Waters’ sharp lyrical instincts combined with the melodic talent of Gilmour, the soft, precise drumming of Nick Mason, and atmospheric patterns of keyboardist Richard Wright (“Us and Them”, for instance, began as a sweetly melodic Wright keyboard instrumental and gained poignancy when Waters added plaintive antiwar lyrics). Unfortunately, this give-and-take relationship began to dissolve: a consequence of the band’s collective ennui, according to Waters. Song-writing credits were a source of contention in these difficult years; Gilmour has noted that his contributions to tracks like “Another Brick in the Wall, Part II”, with its blistering guitar solo, were not always noted in the album credits. Nick Mason addresses the band in-fighting in his memoir, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd, characterizing Waters as being egomaniacal at times. It was while recording The Wall that Waters decided to fire Wright, after Wright’s personal problems began to affect the album production. Wright stayed with the band as a paid session musician while Waters led the band through a complete performance of his opus on every night of the brief tour that followed (for which Gilmour acted as musical director).
In 1983, the last Watersā€“Gilmourā€“Mason collaboration, The Final Cut, was released. The sleeve notes describe it as being a piece “by Roger Waters” that was “performed by Pink Floyd” (rather than an actual Pink Floyd record). So, to many the album came across more like a Roger Waters solo album than Pink Floyd (similar to A Momentary Lapse of Reason and, to a smaller extent, The Division Bell being tagged as Gilmour solo albums). Gilmour unsuccessfully tried to delay production on the album until he could author more material; Waters refused, and in 1985, he proclaimed that the band had dissolved due to irreconcilable differences. The ensuing battle between Waters and Gilmour over the latter’s intention to continue to use the name Pink Floyd descended into threatened lawsuits and public bickering in the press. Waters claimed that, as the original band consisted of himself, Syd Barrett, Nick Mason and Richard Wright, Gilmour could not reasonably use the name Pink Floyd now that it was without three of its founding members. Another of Waters’ arguments was that he had written almost all of the band’s lyrics and a great part of the music after Barrett’s departure. However, through agreement, Gilmour and Mason won the right to use the name and a majority of the band’s songs, though Waters did retain the rights to the albums The Wall (save for three of the songs that Gilmour co-wrote), Animals, and The Final Cut, as well as claiming ownership of the famous Pink Floyd pigs (although Gilmour circumvented the latter by equipping the 1987 version of the band’s pig with a splendid pair of testicles).
For many fans and casual listeners, the collaborative years of 1971ā€“1979 remain the “classic” Pink Floyd years due to the albums released and prominence of Pink Floyd in music culture; a 1987 end-of-year review in Rolling Stone noted that Waters’ solo effort Radio K.A.O.S. and the post-Waters Pink Floyd album A Momentary Lapse of Reason, if taken together, might have made a nice follow-up to The Dark Side of the Moon. In 2005, Waters agreed to rejoin Pink Floyd on stage for Live 8, and on 2 July 2005, Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Rick Wright performed together on-stage for the first time since the June 1981 Wall concerts at Earl’s Court in London.
After his departure from Pink Floyd, Waters embarked on a solo career producing three concept albums and a movie soundtrack which did not garner impressive sales. His solo work has managed critical acclaim and even some comparison to previous work with Pink Floyd.
His first truly solo album, 1984′s The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, was a project about a man’s dreams across one night. The list of musicians helping Waters during recording included guitarist Eric Clapton and jazz saxophonist David Sanborn. Conceived around the same time as The Wall, the concept was shown and demos played to the Pink Floyd members, but they chose to proceed with The Wall over The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, rejecting the latter as “too personal” (Gilmour was later to claim that this was not as obvious a task as might first seem, as, in his opinion, both demos were “unlistenable” and “sounded exactly alike.” Longtime Pink Floyd engineer Nick Griffiths, however, says otherwise: “They were seriously rough, but the songs were there.” The album, not aided by Gerald Scarfe artwork that some claimed was sexist, received mixed reviews, with Kurt Loder describing Pros And Cons Of Hitch Hiking in Rolling Stone as a “strangely static, faintly hideous record,” adding that “Waters sounds like the kind of guy who’d bring Hershey bars and nylons along on a first date.” (Loder gave the album one star out of five, though user ratings have averaged four out of five). On the other end of the spectrum, Mike DeGagne of the All Music Guide praised the album for its “ingenious symbolism and his brilliant use of stream of consciousness within a subconscious realm,” rating it four out of five stars. The resulting concert tour featuring a set design by Marc Brickman and Mark Fisher of Park Display, and, on the first leg, Clapton on lead guitar, was not a success.
In 1986 Waters contributed songs and a score to the soundtrack of the movie When the Wind Blows, based on the Raymond Briggs book of the same name. His backing band, featuring Paul Carrack, was credited as The Bleeding Heart Band. Waters’ then legal wranglings with Gilmour over the Pink Floyd brand are alluded to on the soundtrack album’s “Towers of Faith,” where the vocal transforms from “This land is my land,” to “This sand is my sand,” to “This band is my band.”
In 1987 Waters (still accompanied by the Bleeding Heart Band, although not always credited as such) released another concept album, Radio K.A.O.S., about a man named Billy who can hear radio waves in his head. Waters followed the release with a supporting tour, also in 1987. The sound system for the arena portion of the tour used numerous speakers which created a surround sound effect (Waters had already employed Holophonics (only the second act to do so, after Psychic TV) on The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, and QSound on Amused To Death; while K.A.O.S. does not feature any system of spatial encoding, it was lauded for its production and stereo imaging, courtesy of long-time collaborator James Guthrie). Though applauded by many for its contemporary sound, the album did not garner the impressive sales he had achieved in Pink Floyd (years later, Waters himself would express dissatisfaction at the album, expressing distaste for the production, and particularly regretting his decision to trim the album from a double to a single, losing much of the concept in the process). This was possibly attributable to the fact that he was now competing with a reformed Pink Floyd who were touring to support their ‘comeback’ release, A Momentary Lapse of Reason (which Waters described as, “A very facile but quite fair forgery”.
After the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, Waters staged a gigantic charity concert of The Wall in Berlin on July 21, 1990 to commemorate the end of the division between East and West Germany. The concert took place on Potsdamer Platz (a location which was part of the former “no-man’s land” of the Berlin Wall), and featured many guest superstars: The Band, Bryan Adams, Cyndi Lauper, Van Morrison, SinĆ©ad O’Connor, The Hooters, The Scorpions, Marianne Faithfull, and Joni Mitchell. It was one of the biggest concerts ever staged with an attendance of over 300,000 and was watched live by over five million people worldwide. However, the initial funds raised from the concert barely covered expenses, although syndication and home-video sales allowed Waters to present his chosen charity to benefit from the event, The Leonard Cheshire Foundation, with a sizeable donation.
1992′s Amused to Death, about the corrupting, desensitising nature of television, is perhaps Waters’ most critically acclaimed solo recording, with music critics comparing it to later Pink Floyd work, such as The Wall (Waters himself describes the record as the third in a thematically-linked trilogy, after Dark Side Of The Moon and The Wall). The album had one hit which was “What God Wants, Pt. 1″ which hit #4 on Mainstream Rock charts. Jeff Beck, another legendary guitarist, saw action on Waters’s album as he played lead guitar. There was no tour in support of this record, although Waters would later perform several songs from this record nearly eight years later on his In the Flesh tours.
In 1999 Waters embarked on the In the Flesh tour which saw him performing some of his most famous work, both solo and Pink Floyd material. The tour was a success in the US, and after Waters had booked mostly smaller venues (after the let-down in attendance from his 1987 tour), tickets sold so well that most of the concerts had to be upgraded to larger venues. With Gilmour’s Pink Floyd retiring after 1994, and many Floyd albums selling at the pace of Beatles records, Waters was in great demand. The tour eventually stretched across the world. Tickets were at such high demand, that the tour had to be spanned over three years. Almost every show was sold out with some venues garnering more sales than Pink Floyd shows of early touring years. One concert (Filmed in Portland, Oregon) was released on CD and DVD, named In the Flesh Live, after the tour. During this tour he played two new songs from his next solo album, “Flickering Flame” and “Each Small Candle,” as the final encore to the show.
Waters, performing live in 2006In 2002 Waters performed at a concert organised by the Countryside Alliance. In June of 2002 Waters played the Glastonbury Festival performing many classic Pink Floyd songs. This was the first time a special speaker system had been set up among the Glastonbury audience to enable sound effects to appear to be moving around amongst the crowd.
Miramax Films announced in mid-2004 that a production of The Wall was to appear on Broadway with Waters playing a prominent part in its production. Reports stated that the musical contained not only the original tracks from “The Wall,” but also songs from Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and other Pink Floyd albums, as well as new material.
On the night of 1 May 2004, the overture for Ć‡a Ira was pre-premiĆØred on occasion of the Welcome Europe celebrations in the accession country of Malta, performed over Grand Harbour in Valletta and illuminated by light artist Gert Hof. The event was broadcast over all EBU television stations.
In September 2004, Waters released two new tracks, “To Kill The Child” and “Leaving Beirut.” These were released only on the Internet. Both of these tracks were inspired by the U.S./UK 2003 invasion of Iraq. Waters, who currently resides in the U.S., has said that the songs were written immediately after the start of the war, but he delayed releasing them until just before the 2004 Presidential election, hoping to derail George W. Bush’s re-election. The lyrics in “Leaving Beirut” included “Oh George! Oh George! That Texas education must have fucked you up when you were very small.” Although the songs’ criticism was primarily aimed at the American government, Tony Blair is also referenced: “Not in my name, Tony, you great war leader, you.” The songs were also released as a limited edition on CD in Japan.
After the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and subsequent tsunami disaster, Waters performed “Wish You Were Here” with Eric Clapton during a benefit concert on the American network NBC.
Roger Waters performing on his Dark Side Of The Moon Live tour at the Members Equity Stadium in Perth, Australia in 2007On July 2, 2005 Waters and Pink Floyd reunited for a performance at the Live 8 concert. They played a six-song, 23-minute set, including “Speak to Me/Breathe”/”Breathe (Reprise)”, “Money”, “Wish You Were Here”, and “Comfortably Numb”. Before going into “Wish You Were Here”, Waters said:
ā€? It’s actually quite emotional standing up here with these three guys after all these years. Standing to be counted with the rest of you. Anyway, we’re doing this for everyone who’s not here, but particularly, of course, for Syd. ā€¯ 
Waters remarked shortly after Live 8 to the Associated Press that, while the experience of playing as Pink Floyd again was positive, the chances of a bona fide reunion would be “slight”, considering his and Gilmour’s continuing musical and ideological differences. During an interview with Rolling Stone, Waters further denied the possibility of a future Pink Floyd tour, saying “I didn’t mind rolling over for one day, but I couldn’t roll over for a whole fucking tour.” He has since stated on a radio interview that he would be interested in the possibility of recording a new album with the rest of Pink Floyd as long as he had creative control. However, David Gilmour has said on several occasions that he is retired from extensive touring, shedding more doubt on the possibility of a bona fide Pink Floyd reunion tour.
Waters is known to be working on two new solo albums (as remarked to Jim Ladd, with whom he worked on Radio K.A.O.S.): one has the working title of Heartland. Two new songs that might appear on this album have been released on Flickering Flame: The Solo Years Vol. 1: “Each Small Candle” and “Flickering Flame”. The other of the two albums deals with the theme of love, much in the vein of Pros and Cons. A work-in-progress, which may appear on this album and was dubbed “Woman” by bootleggers, was heard during the sound checks for the In the Flesh tour. However, in a recent telephone interview, he confirmed that the release of his next project has been delayed due to not having a concept to draw all the individual songs together into one piece.
In February of 2005 , it was announced on Roger Waters’ website that his opera, Ć‡a Ira, had been completed after 16 years of work. It was released as a CD/DVD set by Sony Classical on September 27, 2005 with Baritone Bryn Terfel, soprano Ying Huang and tenor Paul Groves. The original libretto was written in French by the late Ć‰tienne Roda-Gil, who set the opera during the optimistic days of the early French Revolution. From 1997 Waters rewrote the libretto in English.
On May 20, 2006 he performed with a set band consisting of Roger Taylor and Eric Clapton and former band-mate Nick Mason performing two songs, “Wish You Were Here”, and “Comfortably Numb”.
Solid state laser system designed by Marc Brickman that depicted Dark Side of the Moon album art, used on Waters’ latest tour.Roger Waters toured Europe during the Summer of 2006 and North America in the fall for his The Dark Side of the Moon Live Tour. As part of his performance he played a complete run-through of the 1973 Pink Floyd classic, The Dark Side of the Moon, as the second half of the show. The first half was a mix of Floyd classics and Waters’ solo material. Elaborate staging designed by Marc Brickman, complete with projections, and a full, 360 degree quadrophonic sound system were used. This new Waters’ solo tour is expected to be as successful as his previous In the Flesh tour. His former Pink Floyd bandmate, Nick Mason joined Waters on some of the tour dates. Richard Wright was invited to participate on the tour as well but he declined the offer to work on solo projects. There is also a 2007 leg of the Tour, starting in January in Australia, followed by New Zealand and going through Asia, Europe, South America, and finally North America in June.
Waters’ former bandmate Nick Mason began patching their relationship in 2002. After speaking to Mason and Bob Geldof about a possible Pink Floyd reunion at Live 8, Waters contacted Gilmour by phone and e-mail, and it appears that they have buried the hatchet since the historic concert and now communicate on a friendly basis. Waters has made overtures to Richard Wright, as well. Syd Barrett, who died on Friday 7 July 2006, remained an emotional subject for most of his friends and former colleagues. Waters said in interviews before Barrett’s death that it would be difficult and inappropriate for him to try to insert himself back into his old friend’s life. Waters performed another Dark Side of the Moon concert in the summer of 2007.
He contributed to the The Last Mimzy soundtrack with award-winning composer Howard Shore in March 2007. His song, “Hello (I Love You)”, was played during the credits of the film. Waters commented on its development: “I think together we’ve come up with a song that captures the themes of the movie – the clash between humanity’s best and worst instincts, and how a child’s innocence can win the day.”
In March 2007, Roger Waters told Rolling Stone magazine that he would be a performer at the U.S. leg of the Live Earth event–an international multi-venue concert aimed to raise awareness about global climate change. At that time he also confirmed that his former Pink Floyd bandmates would not be joining him at the event. On July 7th, 2007, Waters played at Live Earth, performing the intro to “In the Flesh”, “Money”, “Us and Them”, “Brain Damage”, and “Eclipse”. Waters finished off with “The Happiest Days of Our Lives” and “Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)”, featuring the Trenton Youth Choir and his trademark inflatable pig.
Waters has also recently become a spokesperson for Millennium Promise, a non-profit organisation that helps fight extreme poverty and malaria. He wrote a special commentary for CNN’s website on June 11, 2007 about the topic.
Roger Waters will continue his The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour in 2008. It is still unknown how many dates are planned, but as of December 21, 2007, a concert in The Netherlands May 11, and a concert in Denmark May 13, have been announced and are currently on sale. Waters will also be performing at the Coachella Festival in April. He will also be doing three dates in the UK, one being 15th May at the new Liverpool Echo arena, the remaining to at the O2 arena in London on the 18th & 19th, plus an additional date in Russia to round up his 2008 DSOTM tour.
Waters has made his views about the 2008 United States Presidential election clear. During his concert appearance at the Coachella Festival on April 27th, 2008, he released the trademark Pink Floyd inflatable pig into the air with the words “Don’t be led to the slaughter” written on one side, next to a cartoon of Uncle Sam holding meat cleavers. “Fear builds walls” was written on the pig’s other side and “Impeach Bush” on the pig’s behind. On the pig’s belly was Democratic Presidential candidate Barack Obama’s name with a check mark beside it. Waters has referred to Hillary Clinton, another Democratic candidate, as “ghastly”.
Roger Waters, and Pink Floyd is the greatest thing to have ever happened, his music.. Defines everything yet its so intense and amazing, no one could ever compare

Just saw rRger in Vancouver BC….he never eases to amaze….a true visionary in our time…shine on!
Just saw Roger in Vancouver BC….he never ceases to amaze….a true visionary in our time…shine on!
I have seen Roger as a member of Pink Floyd and have also seen all of his personal tours to date. He is a gift to the music industry and if you’ve never seen him, do yourself a favor and get to one of his shows!
Even in his late sixties, Roger Waters is still in his prime!  Have seen many of his shows, and I recently just saw his show in Toronto -June 23/13, and it was awesome!  I was literally capitivated and mesmorized by the lyrics/music/sound,the images, and the amazing Toronto fans.   There were a group of 12 year olds, behind me with their grandfater, and all these kids could say was …. “This is awesome,we are going to remember this always!” And they will, jut as I will!
I grew up! listening to Pink Floyd and have always been passionate about the band and would love to have heard her play in one of his shows, but I was pleased to see Roger Waters in one of his shows here in Brazil and was simply wonderful! Thank you for remembering Roger Waters of Brazil on their tours. Come back soon to Brazil.
i just saw roger waters in philly and i was blown away!!! best concert i’ve every gone to by far. pink floyd to me is the most intriguing band of all times.  i GREATLY appreciate their unique, avant guarde approach to music, and i’m keeping my fingers crossed in hopes that roger will keep touring!!!
I have loved pink floyd since i can remember,(around 6 or so) and have loved them ever since. i wish i could meet someone who loves them as much as i do. Not many people my age like them, that i have met. I’m only 26 but just cant get enough of it.
Saw Roger with his Wall tour in Hartfoed, CT this Sept. Amazing! Its unbelievable how a 70 year old man can be so energized for rour hours of singing and shooting around the stage. Move over Mick Jagger!

His story is told with exclusive insight and interviews from friends and associates. Anyone familiar with the bassist knows he’s not afraid of controversy, and the book follows suit with the first sentence stating, “The Wall was Roger Waters’s first solo album.”
The book also has a full discography and tons of pictures from his career. It’s available now in hardcover.

'I look at that beach and I can tell you where each one was lying...   I can still see their faces': Tears of D-Day veterans as they make emotional return to Normandy to honour their fallen comrades
        Former soldiers from Britain and the US stood alongside other heroes as they recalled the harrowing day in 1944. Many were seen saluting at the gravestones of their friends while others wiped tears from their eyes as they listened to speeches made during the commemoration services. Harold Baumgarten, 89, described how he could look out at the beaches of northern France and point to where the bodies lay. The former US soldier was just 19 years old when he jumped off the landing craft and, 70 years on, has paid tribute to the 9,387 Americans who fell during the invasion, suggesting they are the reason he arrived safely back home.
