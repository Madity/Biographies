=======================================================
Robert James "Bobby" Fischer (March 9, 1943 – January 17, 2008) was an American chess prodigy, grandmaster, and the eleventh World Chess Champion. Many consider him the greatest chess player of all time.[1][2][3]
At age 13 Fischer won a "brilliancy" that became known as The Game of the Century.[4] Starting at age 14, Fischer played in eight United States Championships, winning each one by at least a one-point margin. At age 15, Fischer became both the youngest grandmaster up to that time and the youngest candidate for the World Championship. At age 20, Fischer won the 1963–64 U.S. Championship with 11/11, the only perfect score in the history of the tournament. Fischer's My 60 Memorable Games (1969) remains a revered work in chess literature.[5]
In 1970, "Fischer dominated his contemporaries"[6] by winning the 1970 Interzonal Tournament by a record 3½-point margin and winning 20 consecutive games, including two unprecedented 6–0 sweeps in the Candidates Matches.[7] In July 1971, he became the first official World Chess Federation (FIDE) number-one-ranked player, spending 54 total months at number one. In 1972, he captured the World Chess Championship from Boris Spassky of the USSR in a match, held in Reykjavík, Iceland, publicized as a Cold War confrontation which attracted more worldwide interest than any chess championship before or since.[8]
In 1975, Fischer refused to defend his title when an agreement could not be reached with FIDE over one of the conditions for the match. Afterward, Fischer became a recluse, disappearing from the public eye until 1992, when he won an unofficial rematch against Spassky, held in Yugoslavia, which was under a United Nations embargo at the time,[9][10][11] leading to a conflict with the U.S. government, which sought income tax on Fischer's match winnings, and issued a warrant for his arrest.[12]
In the 1990s, Fischer patented a modified chess timing system (which added a time increment after each move; now a standard practice in top tournament and match play) and created a new variant of chess called Fischerandom (Chess960).[13]
During the 1990s and early 2000s, Fischer lived in Hungary, Germany, the Philippines, Japan, and Iceland, and made increasingly anti-American and anti-semitic remarks on various radio stations. Possibly as a result, his U.S. passport was revoked.[14][15][16] Fischer, unaware of his passport's revocation, traveled to Japan, where he was arrested by Japanese authorities,[17] and detained for over eight months (in 2004 and 2005)[18] under threat of deportation. In March 2005, Iceland granted Fischer full citizenship,[19] leading Japanese authorities to release him from prison.[20] Fischer flew to Iceland, where he lived until his death on January 17, 2008.[21]
Bobby Fischer was born at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, Illinois on March 9, 1943.[22] His birth certificate listed his father as Hans-Gerhardt Fischer, also known as Gerardo Liebscher,[23] a German biophysicist. His mother, Regina Wender Fischer, was an American citizen of Polish-Russian Jewish[24] descent,[25][26] Born in Switzerland and raised in St. Louis, Missouri,[22] Regina became a teacher, registered nurse, and later a physician.[27]
After graduating from college in her teens, Regina traveled to Germany to visit her brother. It was there she met geneticist, and future Nobel Prize winner, Hermann Joseph Muller, who persuaded Regina to move to Moscow to study medicine. She enrolled at I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, where she met and married Hans-Gerhardt in November 1933.[28] In 1938, Hans and Regina had a daughter: Joan Fischer. When anti-semitism began to spread under Joseph Stalin, Regina was forced to take Joan and escape to Paris, France, where she became an English teacher, until the threat of a German invasion led her to flee with Joan to the United States in 1939. Hans-Gerhardt tried to follow Regina and Joan, but was prevented from entering the United States due to his German citizenship.[28] Regina and Hans-Gerhardt had separated in Moscow (although they did not officially divorce until 1945).[28]
"In June 1942, Regina became pregnant", and "on March 9, 1943", "Bobby [Fischer] was born at the Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago".[29] At the time, Regina was "homeless"[29] and was forced to shuttle between different jobs and schools all over the country to make ends meet. She engaged in political activism, and raised both Bobby and Joan as a single parent.[30][31][32]
In 1949, the family moved to Brooklyn, New York,[33] where she could "study for a master's degree in nursing and subsequently enter a career as a nurse".[32]
Sources implying that Paul Nemenyi, a Hungarian Jewish physicist, and an expert in fluid and applied mechanics, may have been Fischer's biological father, were first made public in a 2002 investigation by Peter Nicholas and Clea Benson of The Philadelphia Inquirer.[30][34][35] Throughout the 1950s, the FBI investigated Regina and her circle for her alleged communist sympathies, as well as her previous life in Moscow.[36] The FBI files identify Paul Nemenyi as Bobby Fischer's biological father, showing that Hans-Gerhardt Fischer never entered the United States, having been refused admission by U.S. immigration officials due to his alleged Communist sympathies.[34][37][38] Not only were Regina and Nemenyi reported to have had an affair, in 1942, but Nemenyi made monthly child support payments to Regina, and paid for Bobby's schooling until his own death in 1952.[39] Nemenyi had lodged complaints with social workers, saying he was concerned about the way that Regina was raising Bobby, to the point that, on at least one occasion, Nemenyi broke down in tears.[34] Later on Bobby told the Hungarian chess player Zita Rajcsanyi that Paul Nemenyi would sometimes show up at the family's Brooklyn apartment and take him on outings.[30] After Paul Nemenyi died, in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote a letter to Paul Nemenyi's first son (Peter), asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:[34]
Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or medicine was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby.
On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942, and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting.[30] According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.[30]
In March 1949, six-year-old Bobby, and his sister Joan, learned how to play chess using the instructions from a set bought at a candy store.[40] When Joan lost interest in chess and Regina didn't have time to play, it left Fischer to play many of his first games against himself.[41] When the family vacationed at Patchogue, Long Island that summer, Bobby found a book of old chess games, and studied it intensely.[42] Fischer biographer Frank Brady describes the family's move from Manhattan to Brooklyn in 1950:[43]
In the fall of 1950, Regina moved the family out of Manhattan and across the bridge to Brooklyn, where she rented an inexpensive apartment near the intersection of Union and Franklin streets. It was only temporary: She was trying to get closer to a better neighborhood. Robbed of her medical degree in Russia because of the war, she was now determined to acquire a nursing diploma. As soon as she enrolled in the Prospect Heights School of Nursing, the peripatetic Fischer family, citizens of nowhere, moved once again—its tenth transit in six years—to a $52-a-month two-bedroom flat at 560 Lincoln Place in Brooklyn."
The family resided in apartment Q, a "small, basic, but habitable" apartment.[32] It was there that "Fischer soon became so engrossed in the game that Regina feared he was spending too much time alone".[32] As a result, on November 14, 1950, Regina sent a postcard to the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper, seeking to place an ad, inquiring whether other children of Bobby's age might be interested in playing chess with him. The paper rejected her ad because no one could figure out how to classify it, but forwarded her inquiry to Hermann Helms, the "Dean of American Chess", who told her that Master Max Pavey would be giving a simultaneous exhibition on January 17, 1951.[44][45] Fischer played in the exhibition. Although he held on for 15 minutes, even drawing a crowd of onlookers, he eventually lost to the chess master.[46] One of the spectators was Brooklyn Chess Club President Carmine Nigro, who was so impressed with Fischer's play[47] that he introduced him to the club, and began teaching him.[48][49][50] In the summer of 1955, Fischer, then 12 years old, joined the Manhattan Chess Club, the strongest chess club in the country.[51][52] Fischer's relationship with Nigro lasted until 1956,[53][54] when Nigro moved away.[54]
Carmine Nigro introduced Fischer to future grandmaster William Lombardy,[55] and, starting in September 1954,[56] Lombardy began coaching Fischer in private.[57][58] "We spent hours in our sessions, simply playing over quality games", said Lombardy, going on to say that "I tried to instill in Bobby the secret of my own speedy rise. Eidetic Imagery and Total Immersion".[59] Based on a 1956 game Lombardy played against Pavilias Vaitonis (in which he agreed to a draw offer after only 13 moves), he told Fischer: "Do not accept draw offers. For an ambitious and talented player, accepting a draw is death to a top result. Opponents fear an uncompromising opponent and thus make more mistakes. Act as I advise and do not copy my timidity".[60] Lombardy played a key part in Fischer becoming World Champion.[61][62] He was Fischer's aide at Portorož[63][64] where they analyzed Fischer's games.[65] He was Bobby's second in Reykjavik,[66][67][68][69][70][71] where he analyzed with Fischer,[72][73][74] and helped keep Fischer in the match.[75][76][77][78][79]
In June 1956, Fischer began attending the "Hawthorne Chess Club", based in master John "Jack" W. Collins' home.[80] For years it was believed that Collins was Fischer's teacher and coach,[81][82][83][84] even though Collins stated that he did not teach Fischer.[85] It is now believed that Collins was Fischer's mentor, not his teacher or coach.[86][87][88][89] A mentor and a friend, Fischer played thousands of blitz and offhand games with Collins and other strong players, studied the books in Collins' large chess library, and ate almost as many dinners at Collins' home as his own.[90][91][92]
Future grandmaster Arnold Denker was also a mentor to young Bobby, often taking him to watch the New York Rangers play hockey at Madison Square Garden. Bobby enjoyed those treats and never forgot them; the two became lifelong friends.[93]
In 1956, Fischer experienced a "meteoric rise" in his playing strength.[94] On the tenth national rating list of the United States Chess Federation (USCF), published on May 20, 1956, Fischer's rating was 1726,[95] more than 900 points below top-rated Samuel Reshevsky (2663).[96]
In March 1956, the Log Cabin Chess Club of Orange, New Jersey, took Fischer on a tour to Cuba, where he gave a 12-board simultaneous exhibition at Havana's Capablanca Chess Club, winning ten games and drawing two.[97][98] On this tour the club played a series of matches against other clubs. Fischer played second board, behind International Master Norman Whitaker. Whitaker and Fischer were the leading scorers for the club, each scoring 5½ points out of 7 games.[99]
In July 1956, Fischer won the U.S. Junior Chess Championship, scoring 8½/10 at Philadelphia to become the youngest-ever Junior Champion at age 13,[100] At the 1956 U.S. Open Chess Championship in Oklahoma City, Bobby scored 8½/12 to tie for 4–8th places, with Arthur Bisguier winning.[101] In the first Canadian Open Chess Championship at Montreal 1956, Bobby scored 7/10 to tie for 8–12th places, with Larry Evans winning.[102] In November, Fischer played in the 1956 Eastern States Open Championship in Washington DC, tying for second with William Lombardy, Nicholas Rossolimo, and Arthur Feuerstein, with Hans Berliner taking first by a half-point margin.[103]
Fischer accepted an invitation to play in the Third Lessing J. Rosenwald Trophy Tournament in New York City (1956), a premier tournament limited to the 12 players considered the best in the country.[104] Although Fischer's rating was not among the top 12 in the country, he received entry by special consideration. Playing against top opposition, the 13-year-old Fischer could only score 4½/11, tying for 8–9th place.[105] Yet, Bobby won the brilliancy prize[106] for his '"immortal"'[107] game against International Master[108] Donald Byrne,[104] in which Bobby sacrificed his queen to unleash an unstoppable attack. Hans Kmoch called it "The Game of the Century". Wrote Kmoch, "The following game, a stunning masterpiece of combination play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent, matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies".[109][110] "'The Game of the Century' has been talked about, analyzed, and admired for more than fifty years, and it will probably be a part of the canon of chess for many years to come".[111] "In reflecting on his game a while after it occurred, Bobby was refreshingly modest: 'I just made the moves I thought were best. I was just lucky.'"[112]
In 1957, Fischer played a two-game match against former World Champion Max Euwe at New York, losing ½–1½.[113][114][115] On the USCF's eleventh national rating list, published on May 5, 1957, Fischer was rated 2231, a master—over 500 points higher than his rating a year before.[116] This made him, at that time, the country's youngest ever chess master.[117] In July, Bobby successfully defended his U.S. Junior title, scoring 8½/9 at San Francisco.[118] As a result of his strong tournament results, Fischer's rating went up to 2298, "making him among the top ten active players in the country".[119] In August, Fischer scored 10/12 at the U.S. Open Chess Championship in Cleveland, winning on tie-breaking points over Arthur Bisguier.[120][121] This made Bobby the youngest ever U.S. Open Champion.[122][123] Bobby won the New Jersey Open Championship, scoring 6½/7.[124] He then defeated the young Filipino master Rodolfo Tan Cardoso 6–2 in a New York match sponsored by Pepsi-Cola.[125][126]
Based on Fischer's rating and strong results, the USCF invited him to play in the 1957–58 U.S. Championship.[127] The tournament included such luminaries as six-time U.S. champion Samuel Reshevsky, defending U.S. champion Arthur Bisguier, and World Junior Champion William Lombardy, who in August had won the World Junior Championship with the only perfect score (11–0) in the history of the event.[128][129][130] Bisguier predicted that Fischer would "finish slightly over the center mark".[128][131] Despite all the predictions to the contrary, Fischer scored eight wins and five draws to win the tournament by a one-point margin, with 10½/13.[132][133] Still two months shy of his 15th birthday, Fischer became the youngest ever U.S. Champion[134] Since the championship that year was also the U.S. Zonal Championship, Fischer's victory earned him the title of International Master.[135][136] Fischer's victory in the U.S. Championship sent his rating up to 2626; the second-best U.S. player, behind only Reshevsky (2713),[137] and qualified him to participate in the 1958 Portorož Interzonal, the next step toward challenging the World Champion.[125]
Bobby wanted to go to Moscow. At his pleading, "Regina wrote directly to the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, requesting an invitation for [Bobby] to participate in the World Youth and Student Festival. The reply—affirmative—came too late for him to go".[138] Regina did not have the money to pay the airfare, but in the following year Fischer was invited onto the game show I've Got a Secret, where, thanks to Regina's efforts, the producers of the show arranged two round-trip tickets to Russia.[139]
Once in Russia, Fischer was invited by the Soviet Union to Moscow,[140] where International Master Lev Abramov would serve as a guide to both Bobby and his sister, Joan.[141] Upon arrival, Fischer immediately demanded that he be taken to the Moscow Central Chess Club,[142] where he played speed chess with "two young Soviet masters", Evgeni Vasiukov and Alexander Nikitin,[143] winning every game.[142] Chess author V. I. Linder writes about the impression Fischer gave grandmaster Vladimir Alatortsev when he played blitz against the Soviet masters: "Back in 1958, in the Central Chess Club, Vladimir Alatortsev saw a tall, angular 15-year-old youth, who in blitz games, crushed almost everyone who crossed his path... Alatortsev was no exception, losing all three games. He was astonished by the play of the young American Robert Fischer, his fantastic self-confidence, amazing chess erudition and simply brilliant play! On arriving home, Vladimir said in admiration to his wife: 'This is the future world champion!'"[144]
Fischer demanded to play against Mikhail Botvinnik, the reigning World Champion. When told that this was impossible, Fischer asked to play Keres. "Finally, Tigran Petrosian was, on a semi-official basis, summoned to the club..." where he played speed games with Fischer, winning the majority.[145] "When Bobby discovered that he wasn't going to play any formal games... he went into a not-so-silent rage",[146] saying he was fed up "with these Russian pigs",[147] which angered the Soviets who saw Fischer as their honored guest. It was then that the Yugoslavian chess officials offered to take in Fischer and Joan as early guests to the Interzonal. Fischer took them up on the offer, arriving in Yugoslavia to play two short training matches against masters Dragoljub Janošević and Milan Matulović.[148] Fischer drew both games against Janošević, and then defeated Matulović in Belgrade by 2½–1½.[149]
The top six finishers in the Interzonal would qualify for the Candidates Tournament.[150] Most observers doubted that a 15-year-old with no international experience could finish among the six qualifiers at the Interzonal, but Fischer told journalist Miro Radoicic, "I can draw with the grandmasters, and there are half-a-dozen patzers in the tournament I reckon to beat".[151][152] Despite some bumps in the road, and a problematic start, Fischer succeeded in his plan: after a strong finish, he ended up with 12/20 (+6−2=12) to tie for 5–6th.[153] The Soviet grandmaster Yuri Averbakh observed, "'In the struggle at the board this youth, almost still a child, showed himself to be a full-fledged fighter, demonstrating amazing composure, precise calculation and devilish resourcefulness. I was especially struck not even by his extensive opening knowledge, but his striving everywhere to seek new paths. In Fischer's play an enormous talent was noticeable, and in addition one sensed an enormous amount of work on the study of chess.'"[154] Soviet grandmaster Bronstein said of Fischer's time in Portorož: "It was interesting for me to observe Fischer, but for a long time I couldn't understand why this 15-year-old boy played chess so well".[155] Fischer became the youngest person ever to qualify for the Candidates, and the youngest ever grandmaster at 15 years, 6 months, 1 day.[156] "By then everyone knew we had a genius on our hands".[157]
Before the Candidates' Tournament, Fischer won the 1958–59 U.S. Championship (scoring 8½/11).[158] He tied for third (with Borislav Ivkov) in Mar del Plata (scoring 10/14), a half-point behind Ludek Pachman and Miguel Najdorf.[159] He tied for 4–6th in Santiago (scoring 7½/12) behind Ivkov, Pachman, and Herman Pilnik.[160]
At the Zürich International Tournament, Fischer finished a point behind future World Champion Mikhail Tal and a half-point behind Yugoslavian grandmaster Svetozar Gligorić.[161][162][163] Tal recalled Fischer's uncompromising style: "In his game with the oldest competitor, the Hungarian grandmaster Gedeon Barcza, Fischer had no advantage, but, not wishing to let his opponent go in peace, played on to the 103rd move. The game was adjourned three times and the contestants used up two score sheets, but even when there were only the kings left on the board, Fischer made two more moves! Draw! Stunned by such a fanatical onslaught, Barcza could barely get up from his chair, but Bobby nonchalantly suggested: 'Let's have a look at the game from the beginning...' Barcza then began pleading: 'Look, I have a wife and children. Who's going to support them in the event of my untimely death!'"[164]
Although Fischer had ended his formal education at age 16, he subsequently taught himself several foreign languages so he could read foreign chess periodicals.[165] According to Latvian chess master Alexander Koblencs, even he and Tal could not match the commitment that Fischer had made to chess. Recalling a conversation from the tournament: "'Tell me, Bobby,' Tal continued, 'what do you think of the playing style of Larissa Volpert?' 'She's too cautious. But you have another girl, Dmitrieva. Her games do appeal to me!' Here we were left literally open-mouthed in astonishment. Misha and I have looked at thousands of games, but it never even occurred to us to study the games of our women players. How could we find the time for this?! Yet Bobby, it turns out, had found the time!'"[166]
Until late 1959, Fischer "had dressed atrociously for a champion, appearing at the most august and distinguished national and international events in sweaters and corduroys".[167] A director of the Manhattan Chess Club had once banned Fischer for not being "properly accoutered", forcing Denker to intercede to get him reinstated.[168] Now, encouraged by Pal Benko to dress more smartly, Fischer "began buying suits from all over the world, hand-tailored and made to order".[169][170] He told journalist Ralph Ginzburg that he had 17 hand-tailored suits, and that all of his shirts and shoes were handmade.[171]
At the age of 16, Fischer finished equal fifth out of eight (the top non-Soviet player) at the 1959 Candidates Tournament in Bled/Zagreb/Belgrade, Yugoslavia,[172] scoring 12½/28. He was outclassed by tournament winner Tal, who won all four of their individual games.[173] That year, Fischer released his first book of collected games: Bobby Fischer's Games of Chess, published by Simon & Schuster.[174]
Bobby's interest in chess became more important than schoolwork, to the point that "by the time he reached the fourth grade, he'd been in and out of six schools". In 1952, Regina got Bobby a scholarship (based on his chess talent and "astronomically high IQ") to Brooklyn Community Woodward.[175][176] Fischer later attended Erasmus Hall High School at the same time as Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond.[177][178] In 1959, its student council awarded him a gold medal for his chess achievements.[179][180] The same year, Fischer dropped out of high school when he turned age 16, the earliest he could legally do so.[181][182] He later explained to Ralph Ginzburg, "You don't learn anything in school".[183][184]
When Fischer was 16, his mother moved out of their apartment to pursue medical training. Her friend Joan Rodker, who had met Regina when the two were "idealistic communists" living in Moscow in the 1930s, believes that Fischer resented his mother for being mostly absent as a mother, a communist activist and an admirer of the Soviet Union, and that this led to his hatred for the Soviet Union. In letters to Rodker, Fischer's mother states her desire to pursue her own "obsession" of training in medicine and writes that her son would have to live in their Brooklyn apartment without her: "It sounds terrible to leave a 16-year-old to his own devices, but he is probably happier that way".[185] The apartment was on the edge of Bedford-Stuyvesant, a neighborhood that had one of the highest homicide and general crime rates in New York City.[186] Despite the alienation from her son, Regina, in 1960, protested the practices of the American Chess Foundation,[187] and staged a five-hour protest in front of the White House, urging President Dwight Eisenhower to send an American team to that year's chess Olympiad (set for Leipzig, East Germany, behind the Iron Curtain), and to help support the team financially.[188]
Fischer played in eight U.S. Championships, winning all of them,[189][190] by at least a one-point margin.[191] His results were:[189][192][193]
Fischer missed the 1961–62 Championship (he was preparing for the 1962 Interzonal), and there was no 1964–65 event.[203] Out of eight U.S. Chess Championships, Fischer lost only three games; to Edmar Mednis in the 1962–63 event, and in consecutive rounds to Samuel Reshevsky, and Robert Byrne in the 1965 championship, culminating in a total score of 74/90 (61 wins, 26 draws, 3 losses).[204]
Fischer refused to play in the 1958 Munich Olympiad when his demand to play first board ahead of Samuel Reshevsky was rejected.[205][206] Some sources claim that 15-year-old Fischer was unable to arrange leave from attending high school.[207] Fischer would later represent the United States on first board at four Men's Chess Olympiads:
Out of four Men's Chess Olympiad's, Fischer scored +40−7=18, for 49/65: 75.4%.[212][213] In 1966, Fischer narrowly missed the individual gold medal, scoring 88.23% to World Champion Tigran Petrosian's 88.46%, even though he played four games more than Petrosian, faced stiffer opposition,[214] and would have won the gold if he had accepted Florin Gheorghiu's draw offer, rather than declining it and suffering his only loss.[215]
At the 1962 Varna Olympiad, "Fischer met Argentina's famed Miguel Najdorf, and like Babe Ruth's famed three home run prediction, Bobby made one relative to the Argentinian. He said he would beat him in twenty-five moves; he did it in twenty-four, accounting for Najdorf's only loss of the tournament".[216] Ironically, Najdorf lost the game whilst employing the very opening variation named after him: the Sicilian Najdorf.[217]
Fischer had planned to play for the U.S. at the 1968 Lugano Olympiad, but backed out when he saw the poor playing conditions.[218] Both former World Champion Tigran Petrosian and Belgian-American International Master George Koltanowski, the "leader of the American team" that year, felt that Fischer was "justified" in not participating in the Olympiad.[219] According to Lombardy, Fischer's non-participation was due to Reshevsky's refusal to "yield first board".[220]
In 1960, Fischer tied for first place with Soviet star Boris Spassky at the strong Mar del Plata Tournament in Argentina, winning by a two-point margin, scoring 13½/15 (+13−1=1),[221][222] ahead of David Bronstein.[223] Fischer lost only to Spassky; this was the start of their lifelong friendship.[224]
Fischer experienced the only failure in his competitive career[225] at the Buenos Aires Tournament (1960), finishing with 8½/19 (+3−5=11), far behind winners Viktor Korchnoi and Samuel Reshevsky with 13/19.[226] According to Larry Evans, Fischer's first sexual experience was with a girl to whom Evans introduced him during the tournament.[227][228] Pal Benko says that Fischer did horribly in the tournament "because he got caught up in women and sex. Afterwards, Fischer said he'd never mix women and chess together, and kept the promise".[229] Fischer concluded 1960 by winning a small tournament in Reykjavík with 4½/5,[230] and defeating Klaus Darga in an exhibition game in West Berlin.[231]
In 1961, Fischer started a 16-game match with Reshevsky, split between New York and Los Angeles.[232] Reshevsky, 32 years Fischer's senior, was considered the favorite, since he had far more match experience and had never lost a set match.[233] After 11 games and a tie score (two wins apiece with seven draws), the match ended prematurely due to a scheduling dispute between Fischer and match organizer and sponsor Jacqueline Piatigorsky.[234][235] Reshevsky was declared the winner, by default, and received the winner's share of the prize fund.[236]
Fischer was second in a super-class field, behind only former World Champion Tal at Bled, 1961.[237] Yet, Fischer defeated Tal head-to-head for the first time in their individual game, scored 3½/4 against the Soviet contingent, and finished as the only unbeaten player, with 13½/19 (+8−0=11).[238][239]
Fischer won the 1962 Stockholm Interzonal by a 2½-point margin,[240] going undefeated, with 17½/22 (+13−0=9).[241][242] He was the first non-Soviet player to win an Interzonal since FIDE instituted the tournament in 1948.[243] Russian grandmaster Alexander Kotov said of Fischer:[244]
I have discussed Fischer's play with Max Euwe and Gideon Stahlberg. All of us, experienced 'tournament old-timers', were surprised by Fischer's endgame expertise. When a young player is good at attacking or at combinations, this is understandable, but a faultless endgame technique at the age of 19 is something rare. I can recall only one other player who at that age was equally skillful at endgames — Vasily Smyslov.
Fischer's victory made him a favorite for the Candidates Tournament in Curaçao.[245][246] Yet, he finished fourth out of eight with 14/27 (+8−7=12),[247] far behind Tigran Petrosian (17½/27), Efim Geller, and Paul Keres (both 17/27).[248] Tal fell very ill during the tournament, and had to withdraw before completion. Fischer, a friend of Tal, was the only contestant who visited him in the hospital.[249]
Following his failure[250] in the 1962 Candidates, Fischer asserted, in an August 1962 Sports Illustrated article, entitled The Russians Have Fixed World Chess, that three of the five Soviet players (Tigran Petrosian, Paul Keres, and Efim Geller) had a prearranged agreement to quickly draw their games against each other in order to conserve their energy for playing against Fischer, and that a fourth, Viktor Korchnoi, had been forced to deliberately lose games to ensure that a Soviet player won the tournament. It is generally thought that the former accusation is correct, but not the latter.[251][252] Fischer stated that he would never again participate in a Candidates' tournament, since the format, combined with the alleged collusion, made it impossible for a non-Soviet player to win. Following Fischer's article, FIDE, in late 1962, voted a radical reform of the playoff system, replacing the Candidates' tournament with a format of one-on-one knockout matches; the format that Fischer would dominate in 1971.[253][254]
Fischer defeated Bent Larsen in a summer 1962 exhibition game in Copenhagen for Danish TV. Later that year, Fischer beat Bogdan Śliwa in a team match against Poland in Warsaw.[255]
In the 1962–63 U.S. Championship, Fischer experienced his first single-game loss (to Edmar Mednis) in round one. Bisguier was in excellent form, and Fischer caught up to him only at the end. Tied at 7–3, the two met in the final round. Bisguier stood well in the middlegame, but blundered, handing Fischer his fifth consecutive U.S. championship.[256]
Although Fischer's mother was Jewish, Fischer disavowed having Jewish roots.[257] In an interview in the January 1962 issue of Harper's, Fischer was quoted as saying, "I read a book lately by Nietzsche and he says religion is just to dull the senses of the people. I agree".[258][259]
Fischer joined the Worldwide Church of God in the mid-1960s. The church prescribed Saturday Sabbath, and forbade work (and competitive chess) on Sabbath.[260] During the mid 1970s Fischer contributed significant money to the Worldwide Church of God.[261] In 1972 one journalist stated that "Fischer is almost as serious about religion as he is about chess", and the champion credited his faith with greatly improving his chess.[262] Yet, prophecies by Herbert W. Armstrong went unfulfilled,[263] and the church was rocked by revelations of a series of sex scandals involving Garner Ted Armstrong.[264] Fischer eventually left the church in 1977, "accusing it of being 'satanic,' and vigorously attacking its methods and leadership".[265]
Influenced by ill will over the aborted 1961 match against Reshevsky, Fischer declined an invitation to play in the 1963 Piatigorsky Cup tournament in Los Angeles, which had a world-class field.[266] He instead played in the Western Open in Bay City, Michigan, which he won with 7½/8.[267][268] In August–September 1963, Fischer won the New York State Championship at Poughkeepsie, with 7/7, his first perfect score,[269] "ahead of Bisguier and Sherwin".[270]
In the 1963–64 U.S. Championship, Fischer achieved his second perfect score, this time against the top-ranked chess players in the country: "This tournament became, as they say, the stuff of legend. The fact that Fischer won his sixth U.S. title was no surprise. The way he did it was spectacular".[199] "One by one Fischer mowed down the opposition as he cut an 11–0 swathe through the field, to demonstrate convincingly to the opposition that he was now in a class by himself".[266] This result brought Fischer heightened fame, including a profile in Life magazine.[271] Sports Illustrated diagrammed each of the 11 games in its article, "The Amazing Victory Streak of Bobby Fischer".[272] Such extensive chess coverage was groundbreaking for the top American sports' magazine. His 11–0 win in the 1963–64 Championship is the only perfect score in the history of the tournament,[273][274] and one of about ten perfect scores in high-level chess tournaments ever.[275][276][277] David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld called it "the most remarkable achievement of this kind".[275] Fischer recalls:[278]
Motivated by my lopsided result (11–0!), Dr. [Hans] Kmoch congratulated [Larry] Evans (the runner up) on "winning" the tournament... and then he congratulated me on "winning the exhibition."
International Master Anthony Saidy recalled his last round encounter with the undefeated Fischer:[279]
Going into the final game I certainly did not expect to upset Fischer. I hardly knew the opening but played simply, and he went along with the scenario, opting for a N-v-B [i.e., Knight vs. Bishop] endgame with a minimal edge. In the corridor, Evans said to me, 'Good. Show him we're not all children.'
At adjournment, Saidy saw a way to force a draw, yet "sealed a different, wrong move", and lost. "The rest is history".[279] "Chess publications around the world wrote of the unparalleled achievement. Only Bent Larsen, always a Fischer detractor, was unimpressed: 'Fischer was playing against children'".[280]
Fischer, eligible as U.S. Champion, decided against his participation in the 1964 Amsterdam Interzonal, taking himself out of the 1966 World Championship cycle,[281] even after FIDE changed the format of the eight-player Candidates Tournament from a round-robin to a series of knockout matches, which eliminated the possibility of collusion.[271] Instead, Fischer embarked on a tour of the United States and Canada from February through May, playing a simultaneous exhibition, and giving a lecture in each of more than 40 cities.[282] His 94% winning percentage over more than 2,000 games is one of the best ever achieved.[283] Fischer declined an invitation to play for the U.S. in the 1964 Olympiad in Tel Aviv.[284]
Fischer wanted to play in the Capablanca Memorial Tournament, Havana in August and September 1965.[285] Since the State Department refused to endorse Fischer's passport as valid for visiting Cuba,[286] he proposed, and the tournament officials and players accepted, a unique arrangement: Fischer played his moves from a room at the Marshall Chess Club, which were then transmitted by teleprinter to Cuba.[287][288][289][290] Luděk Pachman observed that Fischer "was handicapped by the longer playing session resulting from the time wasted in transmitting the moves, and that is one reason why he lost to three of his chief rivals".[291] The tournament was an "ordeal" for Fischer, who had to endure eight-hour and sometimes even twelve-hour playing sessions.[292] Despite the handicap, Fischer tied for second through fourth places, with 15/21 (+12−3=6),[293] behind former World Champion Vasily Smyslov, whom Fischer defeated in their individual game.[291] The tournament received extensive media coverage.[294][295]
In December, Fischer won his seventh U.S. Championship (1965), with the score of 8½/11 (+8−2=1),[296] despite losing to Robert Byrne and Reshevsky in the eighth and ninth rounds.[297][298] Fischer also reconciled with Mrs. Piatigorsky, accepting an invitation to the very strong second Piatigorsky Cup (1966) tournament in Santa Monica. Fischer began disastrously and after eight rounds was tied for last with 3/8. He then staged "the most sensational comeback in the history of grandmaster chess", scoring 7/8 in the next eight rounds. In the end, World Chess Championship finalist Boris Spassky edged him out by a half point, scoring 11½/18 to Fischer's 11/18 (+7−3=8).[299][300] Now aged 23, Fischer would win every match or tournament he completed for the rest of his life.[301]
Fischer won the U.S. Championship (1966–67) for the eighth and final time, ceding only three draws (+8−0=3),[302][303] In March–April and August–September, Fischer won strong tournaments at Monte Carlo, with 7/9 (+6−1=2),[304] and Skopje, with 13½/17 (+12−2=3).[305][306] In the Philippines, Fischer played nine exhibition games against master opponents, scoring 8½/9.[307]
Fischer's win in the 1966-67 U.S. Championship qualified him for the next World Championship cycle.[296] At the 1967 Sousse Interzonal, Fischer scored 8½ points in the first 10 games, to lead the field. His observance of the Worldwide Church of God's seventh-day Sabbath was honored by the organizers, but deprived Fischer of several rest days, which led to a scheduling dispute,[308] causing Fischer to forfeit two games in protest and later withdraw, eliminating himself from the 1969 World Championship cycle.[309] Since Fischer had completed less than half of his scheduled games, all of his results were annulled, meaning players who had played Fischer had those games cancelled, and the scores nullified from the official tournament record.[253]
In 1968, Fischer won tournaments at Netanya, with 11½/13 (+10−0=3),[310] and Vinkovci, with 11/13 (+9−0=4),[311] by large margins.[312] Fischer then stopped playing for the next 18 months, except for a win against Anthony Saidy in a 1969 New York Metropolitan League team match.[313][314] That year, Fischer (assisted by grandmaster Larry Evans) released his second book of collected games: My 60 Memorable Games, published by Simon & Schuster. The book "was an immediate success".[315]
In 1970, Fischer began a new effort to become World Champion. His dramatic march toward the title made him a household name and made chess front-page news for a time. He won the title in 1972, but forfeited it three years later.

The 1969 U.S. Championship was also a zonal qualifier, with the top three finishers advancing to the Interzonal. Fischer, however, had sat out the U.S. Championship because of disagreements about the tournament's format and prize fund. Benko, one of the three qualifiers, agreed to give up his spot in the Interzonal in order to give Fischer another shot at the World Championship.[316][317][318][319] "When it was suggested to Fischer that Benko was considering the gesture based on a large sum of money to be paid to him, Bobby replied that Benko would not give up his berth for money alone. It was a matter of honor".[320][321] "Lombardy, who was next in line with the right to participate, was queried as to whether he would also step aside. 'I would like to play,' he answered, 'but Fischer should have the chance.'"[320]
Before the Interzonal, in March and April 1970, the world's best players competed in the USSR vs. Rest of the World match in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, often referred to as "the Match of the Century." Fischer allowed Bent Larsen of Denmark to play first board for the Rest of the World team in light of Larsen's recent outstanding tournament results, even though Fischer had the higher Elo rating.[322][323] The USSR team eked out a 20½–19½ victory, but on second board "Fischer was the high scorer for his team, with a 3–1 score against Petrosian (two wins and two draws)".[324]
After the USSR versus the Rest of the World Match, the unofficial World Championship of Lightning Chess (5-minute games) was held at Herceg Novi. "[The Russians] figured on teaching Fischer a lesson and on bringing him down a peg or two".[325] Petrosian and Tal were considered the favorites,[326] but Fischer overwhelmed the super-class field with 19/22 (+17−1=4), far ahead of Tal (14½), Korchnoi (14), Petrosian (13½), and Bronstein (13).[326][327] Fischer lost only one game (to Korchnoi, who was also the only player to achieve an even score against him in the double round robin tournament).[328][329] Fischer "crushed such blitz kings as Tal, Petrosian and Vasily Smyslov by a clean score".[330] Tal marveled that, "During the entire tournament he didn't leave a single pawn en prise!", while the other players "blundered knights and bishops galore".[330][331] For Lombardy, whom Bobby had played many blitz games with,[332] Fischer's 4½-point margin of victory "came as a pleasant surprise".[333]
In April–May 1970, Fischer won at Rovinj/Zagreb with 13/17 (+10−1=6), by a two-point margin, ahead of Gligorić, Hort, Korchnoi, Smyslov, and Petrosian.[334][335] In July–August, Fischer crushed the mostly grandmaster field at Buenos Aires, winning by a 3½-point margin, scoring 15/17 (+13−0=4).[336] Fischer then played first board for the U.S. Team in the 19th Chess Olympiad in Siegen, where he won an individual Silver medal, scoring 10/13 (+8−1=4),[211] with his only loss being to World Champion Boris Spassky.[337] Right after the Olympiad, Fischer defeated Ulf Andersson in an exhibition game for the Swedish newspaper Expressen.[338] Fischer had taken his game to a new level.[339]
Fischer won the Interzonal (held in Palma de Mallorca in November and December 1970) with 18½/23 (+15−1=7),[340] far ahead of Larsen, Efim Geller, and Robert Hübner, with 15/23.[341][342] Fischer finished the tournament with seven consecutive wins.[343][344] Setting aside the Sousse Interzonal (which Fischer withdrew from while leading), Fischer's victory gave him a string of eight consecutive first prizes in tournaments.[318] Former World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik was not, however, impressed by Fischer's results, stating: "Fischer has been declared a genius. I do not agree with this... In order to rightly be declared a genius in chess, you have to defeat equal opponents by a big margin. As yet he has not done this".[345] Despite Botvinnik's remarks, "Fischer began a miraculous year in the history of chess".[346]
In the 1971 Candidates matches, Fischer was set to play against Soviet grandmaster and concert pianist[347] Mark Taimanov in the quarter-finals. "Their match was to begin in May 1971 in Vancouver, Canada, on the beautiful campus of the University of British Columbia".[348] "Analysts and players alike predicted that Fischer would win the Candidates, but not without a struggle. Tal predicted that Fischer would win 5½–4½ against Taimanov".[348] "[Fischer] saw himself as the firm favorite in the Taimanov match. He was not alone; the noncommunist press was of the same mind. Only Taimanov insisted that he could win, dismissing Fischer as a mere computer".[349] Taimanov had reason to be confident. He was backed by the firm guidance of Botvinnik, who "had thoroughly analysed Fischer's record and put together a 'dossier' on him", from when he was in talks to play Fischer in a match "a couple of years earlier".[350] After Fischer defeated Taimanov in the second game of the match, Taimanov asked Fischer how he managed to come up with the move 12. N1c3, to which Fischer replied "that the idea was not his—he had come across it in the monograph by the Soviet master Alexander Nikitin in a footnote".[351] Taimanov said of this: "It is staggering that I, an expert on the Sicilian, should have missed this theoretically significant idea by my compatriot, while Fischer had uncovered it in a book in a foreign language!"[352] With the score at 4-0, in Fischer's favor, the fifth game adjournment was a sight to behold[353] Schonberg explains the scene:[325]
Taimanov came to Vancouver with two seconds, both grandmasters. Fischer was alone. He thought that the sight of Taimanov and his seconds was the funniest thing he had ever seen. There Taimanov and his seconds would sit, six hands flying, pocket sets waving in the air, while variations were being spouted all over the place. And there sat Taimanov with a confused look on his face. Just before resuming play [in the fifth game] the seconds were giving Taimanov some last-minute advice. When poor Taimanov entered the playing room and sat down to confront Fischer, his head was so full of conflicting continuations that he became rattled, left a Rook en prise and immediately resigned.
Fischer beat Taimanov by the score of 6–0.[354] "The record books showed that the only comparable achievement to the 6–0 score against Taimanov was Wilhelm Steinitz's 7–0 win against Joseph Henry Blackburne in 1876 in an era of more primitive defensive technique".[355] "It is difficult to portray to non-chess players the magnitude of such a shutout. A typical result between well-matched players might be, say, six wins to four, with nine draws".[356] Upon losing the final game of the match, Taimanov shrugged his shoulders, saying sadly to Fischer: "Well, I still have my music".[357] As a result of his performance, Taimanov "was thrown out of the USSR team and forbidden to travel for two years. He was banned from writing articles, was deprived of his monthly stipend... [and] the authorities prohibited him from performing on the concert platform".[358] "The crushing loss virtually ended Taimanov's chess career".[359] Fischer was next scheduled to play against Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen. "Spassky predicted a tight struggle: 'Larsen is a little stronger in spirit.'"[360] Before the match, Botvinnik had told a Soviet television audience:[361]
It is hard to say how their match will end, but it is clear that such an easy victory as in Vancouver [against Taimanov] will not be given to Fischer. I think Larsen has unpleasant surprises in store for [Fischer], all the more since having dealt with Taimanov thus, Fischer will want to do just the same to Larsen and this is impossible.
Fischer beat Larsen by the score of 6–0.[362] Robert Byrne writes: "It is out of the question for me to explain how Bobby, how anyone, could win six games in a row from such a genius of the game as Bent Larsen".[363] Just a year before, Larsen had played first board for the Rest of the World team ahead of Fischer, and had handed Fischer his only loss at the Interzonal. Garry Kasparov later wrote that no player had ever shown a superiority over his rivals comparable to Fischer's "incredible" 12–0 score in the two matches.[364] Chess statistician Jeff Sonas concludes that the victory over Larsen gave Fischer the "highest single-match performance rating ever".[365]
In August 1971, while preparing for his last Candidates match with former World Champion Tigran Petrosian, Fischer played a strong lightning event at the Manhattan Chess Club, winning with 21½/22.[327]
Despite Fischer's results against Taimanov and Larsen, his upcoming match against Petrosian seemed a daunting task.[366] Nevertheless, the Soviet government was concerned about Fischer.[367][368] "Reporters asked Petrosian whether the match would last the full twelve games... 'It might be possible that I win it earlier,' Petrosian replied",[369] and then stated: "Fischer's [nineteen consecutive] wins do not impress me. He is a great chess player but no genius".[370] Petrosian played a strong theoretical novelty in the first game, gaining the advantage, but Fischer eventually won the game after Petrosian faltered.[371][372][373] This gave Fischer a run of 20 consecutive wins against the world's top players (in the Interzonal and Candidates matches), a winning streak topped only by Steinitz's 25 straight wins in 1873–82.[374] Petrosian won the second game, finally snapping Fischer's streak.[375] After three consecutive draws, Fischer swept the next four games to win the match 6½–2½ (+5−1=3).[376] Sports Illustrated ran an article on the match, highlighting Fischer's domination of Petrosian as being due to Petrosian's outdated system of preparation:[377]
Fischer's recent record raises the distinct possibility that he has made a breakthrough in modern chess theory. His response to Petrosian's elaborately plotted 11th move in the first game is an example: Russian experts had worked on the variation for weeks, yet when it was thrown at Fischer suddenly, he faced its consequences alone and won by applying simple, classic principles.
Upon completion of the match, Petrosian remarked: "After the sixth game Fischer really did become a genius. I on the other hand, either had a breakdown or was tired, or something else happened, but the last three games were no longer chess".[378][379] "Some experts kept insisting that Petrosian was off form, and that he should have had a plus score at the end of the sixth game..." to which Fischer replied "'People have been playing against me below strength for fifteen years'"[380] Fischer's match results befuddled Botvinnik: "It is hard to talk about Fischer's matches. Since the time that he has been playing them, miracles have begun".[381] "When Petrosian played like Petrosian, Fischer played like a very strong grandmaster, but when Petrosian began making mistakes, Fischer was transformed into a genius".[381]
Fischer gained a far higher rating than any player in history up to that time.[382] On the July 1972 FIDE rating list, his Elo rating of 2785 was 125 points above (World No. 2) Spassky's rating of 2660.[383][384][385] His results put him on the cover of Life magazine,[386] and allowed him to challenge World Champion Boris Spassky, whom he had never beaten (+0−3=2).[387][388]
Fischer's career-long stubbornness about match and tournament conditions was again seen in the run-up to his match with Spassky. Of the possible sites, Fischer's first choice was Belgrade, Yugoslavia, while Spassky's was Reykjavík, Iceland.[389] For a time it appeared that the dispute would be resolved by splitting the match between the two locations, but that arrangement failed.[390] After that issue was resolved, Fischer refused to appear in Iceland until the prize fund was increased. London financier Jim Slater donated an additional US$125,000, bringing the prize fund up to an unprecedented $250,000 ($1,393,283.49 in 2013),[391] and Fischer finally agreed to play.[392]
Before and during the match, Fischer paid special attention to his physical training and fitness, which was a relatively novel approach for top chess players at that time. He had developed his tennis skills to a good level, and played frequently during off-days in Reykjavík. He also had arranged for exclusive use of his hotel's swimming pool during specified hours, and swam for extended periods, usually late at night.[393] According to Soviet grandmaster Nikolai Krogius, Fischer "was paying great attention to sport, and that he was swimming and even boxing..."[394]
The match took place in Reykjavík from July through September 1972.[395] Fischer lost the first two games in strange fashion: the first when he played a risky pawn-grab in a drawn endgame, the second by forfeit when he refused to play the game in a dispute over playing conditions.[396] Fischer would likely have forfeited the entire match, but Spassky, not wanting to win by default, yielded to Fischer's demands to move the next game to a back room, away from the cameras whose presence had upset Fischer.[397][398] After that game, the match was moved back to the stage and proceeded without further serious incident. Fischer won seven of the next 19 games, losing only one and drawing eleven, to win the match 12½–8½ and become the 11th World Chess Champion.[395]
The Cold War trappings made the match a media sensation.[399] It was called "The Match of the Century",[400][401][402] and received front-page media coverage in the United States and around the world.[403][404] Fischer's win was an American victory in a field that Soviet players had dominated for the past quarter-century; players closely identified with, and subsidized by, the Soviet state. Kasparov remarked, "Fischer fits ideologically into the context of the Cold War era: a lone American genius challenges the Soviet chess machine and defeats it".[405][406] Dutch grandmaster Jan Timman calls Fischer's victory "the story of a lonely hero who overcomes an entire empire".[407] Fischer's sister observed, "Bobby did all this in a country almost totally without a chess culture. It was as if an Eskimo had cleared a tennis court in the snow and gone on to win the world championship".[408]
Upon Fischer's return to New York,[409] a Bobby Fischer Day was held.[410] He was offered numerous product endorsement offers worth "at least $5 million" (all of which he declined).[411] He appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated[412] with American Olympic swimming champion Mark Spitz. Fischer also made an appearance on a Bob Hope TV special.[413] Membership in the U.S. Chess Federation doubled in 1972,[414] and peaked in 1974; in American chess, these years are commonly referred to as the "Fischer Boom". Fischer won the 'Chess Oscar'[415] (an award, started in 1967, given to the best chess player, determined through votes from chess media and leading players) for 1970, 1971, and 1972.[416]
Fischer was scheduled to defend his title in 1975 against Anatoly Karpov, who emerged as his challenger.[417] Fischer, who had played no competitive games since his World Championship match with Spassky, laid out a proposal for the match in September 1973, in consultation with FIDE official Fred Cramer. He made three principal (non-negotiable) demands:
In case of a 9–9 score, the champion (Fischer) retains the title, and the prize fund is split equally.[418]
A FIDE Congress was held in 1974 during the Nice Olympiad. The delegates voted in favor of Fischer's 10-win proposal, but rejected his other two proposals, and limited the number of games in the match to 36.[419] In response to FIDE's ruling, Fischer sent a cable to Euwe on June 27, 1974.[420][421][422]
As I made clear in my telegram to the FIDE delegates, the match conditions I proposed were non-negotiable. Mr. Cramer informs me that the rules of the winner being the first player to win ten games, draws not counting, unlimited number of games and if nine wins to nine match is drawn with champion regaining title and prize fund split equally were rejected by the FIDE delegates. By so doing FIDE has decided against my participation in the 1975 World Chess Championship. Therefore, I resign my FIDE World Chess Championship title. Sincerely, Bobby Fischer.
The delegates responded by reaffirming their prior decisions, but did not accept Fischer's resignation and requested that he reconsider.[423] Many observers considered Fischer's requested 9–9 clause unfair because it would require the challenger to win by at least two games (10–8).[424] Botvinnik (who had benefited from both draw odds, the right to an automatic rematch while champion, and possibly also political intimidation of Paul Keres during the 1948 World Championship tournament) called the 9–9 clause "unsporting".[425] Korchnoi, David Bronstein, and Lev Alburt considered the 9–9 clause reasonable.[426][427][428]
Due to the continued efforts of U.S. Chess Association officials,[429] a special FIDE Congress was held in March 1975 in Oosterbeek, the Netherlands in which it was accepted that the match should be of unlimited duration, but the 9–9 clause was once again rejected, by a narrow margin of 35 votes to 32.[430] FIDE set a deadline of April 1, 1975, for Fischer and Karpov to confirm their participation in the match. No reply was received from Fischer by April 3. Thus, by default, Karpov officially became World Champion.[431] In his 1991 autobiography, Karpov professed regret that the match had not taken place, and claimed that the lost opportunity to challenge Fischer held back his own chess development. Karpov met with Fischer several times after 1975, in friendly but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to arrange a match since Karpov would never agree to play to 10.[432]
Brian Carney opined in The Wall Street Journal that Fischer's victory over Spassky in 1972 left him nothing to prove, except that perhaps someone could someday beat him, and he was not interested in the risk of losing. And that Fischer's refusal to recognize peers also allowed his paranoia to flower: "The world championship he won ... validated his view of himself as a chess player, but it also insulated him from the humanizing influences of the world around him. He descended into what can only be considered a kind of madness".[254]
Bronstein felt that Fischer "had the right to play the match with Karpov on his own conditions".[433] Korchnoi stated:[434]
Was Fischer right in demanding that the world title be protected by a two point handicap – that the challenger would be considered the winner with a 10-8 score and that the champion would retain his title in the event of a 9-9 draw? Yes, this was quite natural: the champion deserves this, not to mention the fact that further play to the first win in the event of an even score would be nothing short of a lottery - the winner in that case could not claim to have won a convincing victory.
Soviet grandmaster Lev Alburt felt that the decision to not concede to Fischer's demands rested on Karpov's "sober view of what he was capable of".[435]
Years later, in his 1992 match against Spassky, Fischer indicated to New York Times reporter Roger Cohen that he, Fischer, was not the one who refused to play Karpov, rather that it was Karpov "who refused to play against me [Fischer]".[436]
After the 1972 World Chess Championship, Fischer did not play a competitive game in public for nearly 20 years.[437] In 1977, he played three games in Cambridge, Massachusetts against the MIT Greenblatt computer program, winning all of them.[438]
On May 26, 1981, while walking in Pasadena, Fischer was arrested by a police patrolman, allegedly because Fischer matched the description of a man who had just committed a bank robbery in the area.[439] Fischer, who was slightly injured during the arrest,[440] was held for two days, subjected to assault and various types of mistreatment,[441] and released on $1000 bail.[442] Fischer published a 14-page pamphlet detailing his alleged experiences and saying that his arrest had been "a frame up and set up".[443][444][445]
In 1981, Fischer stayed at the home of grandmaster Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he beat Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games.[265][446] In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:[445][447]
He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.
Fischer emerged after twenty years of isolation to play Spassky (then tied for 96th–102nd on the FIDE rating list) in a "Revenge Match of the 20th century" in 1992. This match took place in Sveti Stefan and Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in spite of a United Nations embargo that included sanctions on commercial activities. Fischer demanded that the organizers bill the match as "The World Chess Championship", although Garry Kasparov was the recognized FIDE World Champion. Fischer insisted he was still the true World Champion, and that for all the games in the FIDE-sanctioned World Championship matches, involving Karpov, Korchnoi, and Kasparov, the outcomes had been prearranged.[448] The purse for the rematch was US$5 million, with $3.35 million of the purse to go to the winner.[449] According to grandmaster Andrew Soltis:[450]
[The match games] were of a fairly high quality, particularly when compared with Kasparov's championship matches of 1993, 1995 and 2000, for example. Yet the games also reminded many fans of how out of place Fischer was in 1992. He was still playing the openings of a previous generation. He was, moreover, the only strong player in the world who didn't trust computers and wasn't surrounded by seconds and supplicants.
Fischer won the match with 10 wins, 5 losses, and 15 draws.[451] Kasparov stated, "Bobby is playing OK, nothing more. Maybe his strength is 2600 or 2650. It wouldn't be close between us".[452] Yasser Seirawan believed that the match proved that Fischer's playing strength was "somewhere in the top ten in the world".[453]
Fischer and Spassky gave ten press conferences during the match.[454] Seirawan attended the match and met with Fischer on several occasions; the two analyzed some match games and had personal discourse. Seirawan later wrote: "After September 23 [1992], I threw most of what I'd ever read about Bobby out of my head. Sheer garbage. Bobby is the most misunderstood, misquoted celebrity walking the face of the earth".[455] He further wrote that Fischer was not camera shy, smiled and laughed easily, was "a fine wit" and "wholly enjoyable conversationalist".[456]
The U.S. Department of the Treasury warned Fischer before the start of the match that his participation was illegal, that it would violate President George H. W. Bush's Executive Order 12810 imposing United Nations Security Council Resolution 757 sanctions against engaging in economic activities in Yugoslavia.[457] In response, during the first scheduled press conference on September 1, in front of the international press, Fischer spat on the U.S. order, saying "this is my reply".[458] His violation of the order led U.S. Federal officials to initiate a warrant for his arrest upon completion of the match,[459] citing, in pertinent part, "Title 50 USC §§1701, 1702, and 1705 and Executive Order 12810".[460][461][462]
Prior to the rematch against Spassky, Fischer had won a training match against Svetozar Gligorić in Sveti Stefan with six wins, one loss and three draws.[463]
After the 1992 match with Spassky, Fischer, now a fugitive, slid back into relative obscurity, taking up residence in Budapest, Hungary, and allegedly having a relationship with young Hungarian chess master Zita Rajcsányi.[464][465]
Fischer claimed that standard chess was stale and that he now played blitz games of chess variants, such as Chess960. He visited with the Polgár family in Budapest and analyzed many games with Judit, Zsuzsa, and Zsófia Polgár.[466][467][468]
From 2000 to 2002, Fischer lived in Baguio City in the Philippines,[469] residing in the same compound as the Filipino grandmaster Eugenio Torre, a close friend who acted as his second during his 1992 match with Spassky.[469] Torre introduced Fischer to a 22-year-old woman named Marilyn Young.[470] On May 21, 2001 Marilyn Young gave birth to a daughter named Jinky Young.[471][472] Her mother claimed that Jinky was Fischer's daughter, citing as evidence Jinky's birth and baptismal certificates, photographs, a transaction record dated December 4, 2007 of a bank remittance by Fischer to Jinky, and Jinky's DNA through her blood samples.[471][473][474] On the other hand, Magnús Skúlason, a friend of Fischer's, said that he was certain that Fischer was not the girl's father.[475] On August 17, 2010, it was reported that a DNA test revealed that Jinky Young was not the daughter of Bobby Fischer.[476][477]
Fischer, whose mother was Jewish,[30][34][35][259] and whose possible biological father was Jewish,[30] made numerous anti-Jewish statements and professed a general hatred for Jews since at least the early 1960s.[259][478] Jan Hein Donner wrote that at the time of Bled 1961, "He idolized Hitler and read everything about him that he could lay his hands on. He also championed a brand of anti-semitism that could only be thought up by a mind completely cut off from reality".[225] Donner took Fischer to a war museum, which "left a great impression, since [Fischer] is not an evil person, and afterwards he was more restrained in his remarks—to me, at least".[225]
Although Fischer described his mother as Jewish in an article he wrote as a teenager,[259] he later denied his Jewish ancestry.[30] In 1984, Fischer denied being a Jew in a letter to the Encyclopaedia Judaica, insisting that they remove his name and accusing them of "fraudulently misrepresenting me to be a Jew [...] to promote your religion".[479]
From the 1980s on, Fischer's comments about Jews were a major theme in his public and private remarks.[480] He openly denied the Holocaust, and called the United States "a farce controlled by dirty, hook-nosed, circumcised Jew bastards".[481] Between 1999 and 2006, Fischer's primary means of communicating with the public was radio interviews. He participated in at least 34 such broadcasts, mostly with radio stations in the Philippines, but also in Hungary, Iceland, Colombia, and Russia. In 1999, he gave a radio call-in interview to a station in Budapest, Hungary, during which he described himself as the "victim of an international Jewish conspiracy". In another radio interview, Fischer said that it became clear to him in 1977, after reading The Secret World Government by Count Cherep-Spiridovich, that Jewish agencies were targeting him.[482] Fischer's sudden reemergence was apparently triggered when some of his belongings, which had been stored in a Pasadena, California storage unit, were sold by the landlord who claimed it was in response to nonpayment of rent.[483]
Fischer's library contained anti-semitic and white supremacist literature such as Mein Kampf, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and The White Man's Bible and Nature's Eternal Religion by Ben Klassen, founder of the Church of the Creator.[484][485] A notebook written by Fischer contains sentiments such as "8/24/99 Death to the Jews. Just kill the Motherfuckers!" and "12/13/99 It's time to start randomly killing Jews".[486][487]
In 2005, some of Fischer's belongings were auctioned on eBay. Fischer claimed, in 2006, that those belongings were worth millions of U.S. dollars.[488][489]
Shortly after midnight on September 12, 2001, Philippines local time (approximately four hours after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the U.S.), Fischer was interviewed live by Pablo Mercado on the Baguio City station of the Bombo Radyo network. Fischer stated that he was happy that the airliner attacks had happened, while expressing his view on U.S. and Israeli foreign policy, saying "I applaud the act. Look, nobody gets ... that the U.S. and Israel have been slaughtering the Palestinians ... for years".[490][491][492][493] He also said "The horrible behavior that the U.S. is committing all over the world ... This just shows you, that what goes around, comes around even for the United States."[490][491] Fischer also referenced the movie Seven Days in May and said he hoped for a military coup d'état in the U.S., "[I hope] the country will be taken over by the military, they'll close down all the synagogues, arrest all the Jews, execute hundreds of thousands of Jewish ringleaders".[494][495] In response to Fischer's statements about 9/11, the U.S. Chess Federation passed a motion to evict him from its organization.[496]
Fischer lived for a time in Japan.[497] On July 13, 2004, acting in response to a letter from U.S. officials, he was arrested by Japanese immigration authorities at Narita International Airport near Tokyo for allegedly using a revoked U.S. passport while trying to board a Japan Airlines flight to Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, Philippines.[498] Fischer resisted arrest, claiming to have sustained bruises, cuts and a broken tooth in the process.[499] At the time, Fischer had a passport (originally issued in 1997 and updated in 2003 to add more pages) that, according to U.S. officials, had been revoked in November 2003 (due to his outstanding arrest warrant for the Yugoslavia sanctions violation).[498] Despite the outstanding arrest warrant in the U.S., Fischer said that he believed the passport was still valid.[500] The authorities held Fischer at a custody center for 16 days before transferring him to another facility. Fischer claimed that his cell was windowless and he had not seen the light of day during that period, and that the staff had ignored his complaints about constant tobacco smoke in his cell.[499]
Tokyo-based Canadian journalist and consultant John Bosnitch set up the "Committee to Free Bobby Fischer" after meeting Fischer at Narita Airport and offering to assist him.[501] It was reported that Fischer and Miyoko Watai, the President of the Japanese Chess Association (with whom he had reportedly been living since 2000) wanted to become legally married.[498] (It was also reported that Fischer had been living in the Philippines with Marilyn Young during the same period.[469]) Fischer applied for German citizenship on the grounds that his father was German.[502] Fischer stated that he wanted to renounce his U.S. citizenship, and appealed to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell to help him do so, though to no effect.[503][504][505] Japan's Justice Minister rejected Fischer's request for asylum and ordered him deported.[506]
Seeking ways to evade deportation to the United States, Fischer wrote a letter to the government of Iceland in early January 2005, requesting Icelandic citizenship.[507] Sympathetic to Fischer's plight, but reluctant to grant him the full benefits of citizenship, Icelandic authorities granted him an alien's passport. When this proved insufficient for the Japanese authorities, Althing (the Icelandic Parliament) agreed unanimously to grant Fischer full citizenship in late March for humanitarian reasons, as they felt he was being unjustly treated by the U.S. and Japanese governments,[508] and also in recognition of his 1972 match, which had "put Iceland on the map".[509][510]
After arriving in Reykjavík, Fischer gave a press conference.[511] Fischer lived a reclusive life in Iceland, avoiding entrepreneurs and others who approached him with various proposals.[512] Fischer moved into an apartment in the same building as his close friend and spokesman, Garðar Sverrisson.[513] Sverrisson's wife, Kristín Þórarinsdóttir, was a nurse and later looked after Fischer as a terminally ill patient. Garðar's two children, especially his son, were very close to Fischer.[514] Fischer also developed a friendship with Magnús Skúlason, a psychiatrist and chess player who later recalled long discussions with Fischer on a wide variety of subjects.[515]
On December 10, 2006, Fischer telephoned an Icelandic television station and pointed out a winning combination, missed by the players and commentators.[516]
On January 17, 2008, Fischer died from degenerative renal failure at the Landspítali Hospital (National University Hospital of Iceland) in Reykjavík.[517][518][519][520] He originally had a urinary tract blockage but refused surgery or medications.[521][522][523] Magnús Skúlason reported Fischer's last words as "Nothing is as healing as the human touch".[515][524]
On January 21, Fischer was buried in the small Christian cemetery of Laugardælir church, outside the town of Selfoss, 60 km southeast of Reykjavík, after a Catholic funeral presided over by Fr. Jakob Rolland of the diocese of Reykjavík. In accordance with Fischer's wishes, only Miyoko Watai, Garðar Sverrisson, and Garðar's family were present.[525][526]
Fischer's estate was estimated at 140 million ISK (about 1 million GBP, or $2 million USD). It quickly became the object of a legal battle involving claims from four parties, with Miyoko Watai ultimately inheriting what remained of Fischer's estate after government claims. The four parties were Fischer's apparent Japanese wife Miyoko Watai, his alleged Philippine daughter Jinky Young and her mother Marilyn Young, his two American nephews Alexander and Nicholas Targ and their father Russell Targ, and the U.S. government (claiming unpaid taxes).[475][515][527][528]
According to a press release issued by Samuel Estimo, an attorney representing Jinky Young, the Supreme Court of Iceland ruled, in December 2009, that Watai's claim of marriage to Fischer was invalidated because of her failure to present the original copy of their alleged marriage certificate.[529] On June 16, 2010, the Court ruled in favor of a petition on behalf of Jinky Young to have Bobby Fischer's remains exhumed.[530][531] The exhumation was performed on July 5, 2010, in the presence of a doctor, a priest, and other officials. A DNA sample was taken and Fischer's body was then reburied.[532] On August 17, 2010, the Court announced that based on the DNA sample it was determined that Fischer was not the father of Jinky Young.[476][477] On March 3, 2011, an Icelandic district court ruled that Miyoko Watai and Fischer had married on September 6, 2004,[533] and that, as Fischer's widow and heir, Watai was therefore entitled to inherit Fischer's estate.[534] Fischer's nephews were ordered to pay Watai's legal costs, amounting to ISK 6.6 million (approximately $57,000).[533]
Fischer was predictable in his use of openings and variations of those openings. Despite this seeming disadvantage, it was very difficult for opponents to exploit this limitation, because Fischer's knowledge of the openings and variations that he used was extensive.[535]
As Black, Fischer would usually play the Najdorf Sicilian against 1. e4, and the King's Indian Defense against 1. d4, only rarely venturing into the Nimzo-Indian Defense (1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4).[536] As White, Fischer almost exclusively played 1. e4 throughout his career.[537]
Fischer was a master of playing with,[538] and against,[539] the Sicilian Defense. The next most common defense against Fischer's 1. e4 was the Caro-Kann Defense (1. e4 c6), to which Fischer had a good record.[540] Fischer's worst record was against the French Defense (1.e4 e6),[541] especially the Winawer Variation (1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4).[542] Fischer maintained that the Winawer was unsound because it exposed Black's kingside, and that, in his view, "Black was trading off his good bishop with 3...Bb4 and ...Bxc3".[543] Later on Fischer said: "I may yet be forced to admit that the Winawer is sound. But I doubt it! The defense is anti-positional and weakens the K-side".[544]
Fischer was renowned for his opening preparation and made numerous contributions to chess opening theory.[545] He was one of the foremost experts on the Ruy Lopez.[546] A line of the Exchange Variation (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Bxc6 dxc6 5.0-0) is sometimes called the "Fischer Variation" after he successfully resurrected it at the 1966 Havana Olympiad.[547][548] Fischer's lifetime score with the move 5.0-0 in tournament and match games was eight wins, three draws, and no losses: (86.36%).[549]
Fischer was a recognized expert in the black side of the Najdorf Sicilian and the King's Indian Defense.[550] He used the Grünfeld Defence and Neo-Grünfeld Defence to win his celebrated games against Donald and Robert Byrne, and played a theoretical novelty in the Grünfeld against reigning World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik, refuting Botvinnik's prepared analysis over-the-board.[551][552] In the Nimzo-Indian Defense, the line beginning with 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 b6 5.Ne2 Ba6 was named after him.[553][554][555]
Fischer established the viability of the so-called Poisoned Pawn Variation of the Najdorf Sicilian (1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4 Qb6). This bold queen sortie, to snatch a pawn at the expense of development, had been considered dubious,[556][557][558] but Fischer succeeded in proving its soundness.[559] Out of ten tournament and match games as Black in the Poisoned Pawn, Fischer scored 70%, winning five, drawing four, and losing only one: the 11th game of his 1972 match against Spassky.[560] Following Fischer's use, the Poisoned Pawn Variation became a respected line, utilized by many of the world's leading players.[561]
On the white side of the Sicilian, Fischer made advances to the theory of the line beginning 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 (or e6) 6.Bc4,[559][562] which has sometimes been named after him.[563] In 1961, prompted by a loss the year before to Spassky,[564] Fischer wrote an article entitled "A Bust to the King's Gambit" for the first issue of the American Chess Quarterly, in which he stated, "In my opinion, the King's Gambit is busted. It loses by force".[565] Fischer recommended 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 d6,[566] which has since become known as the Fischer Defense, as a refutation to the King's Gambit.[567][568][569] Fischer later played the King's Gambit as White in three tournament games, winning them all.[570]
Fischer had excellent endgame technique.[571] International Master Jeremy Silman listed him as one of the five best endgame players (along with Emanuel Lasker, Akiba Rubinstein, José Capablanca, and Vasily Smyslov), calling Fischer a "master of bishop endings".[572] The endgame of a rook, bishop, and pawns against a rook, knight, and pawns has sometimes been called the "Fischer Endgame" because of several instructive wins by Fischer (with the bishop), including three against Mark Taimanov in 1970 and 1971.[573][574][575]
In 1988, Fischer filed for U.S. Patent 4,884,255 for a new type of chess clock, which gave each player a fixed period at the start of the game and then added a small increment after each completed move.[576] Used in the 1992 rematch between Fischer and Spassky,[577][578] the "Fischer clock" soon became standard in most major chess tournaments.[579]
Fischer heavily disparaged chess as it was currently being played (at the highest levels).[580] As a result, on June 19, 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Fischer announced and advocated a variant of chess called Fischerandom Chess (later known as Chess960). The goal of Fischerandom Chess was to ensure that a game between two players is a contest between their understandings of chess, rather than their abilities to memorize opening lines or prepare opening strategies.[581]
In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer explained his reasons for advocating Fischerandom Chess:[582]
In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not know as much as I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn’t do well. They’d get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don’t like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...
Kasparov calls Fischer "perhaps the most mythologically shrouded figure in chess".[583] Some leading players and some of Fischer's biographers have ranked him as the greatest player who ever lived.[584] Other writers have said that he was arguably the greatest player ever, without reaching a definitive conclusion.[585] Leonard Barden wrote, "Most experts place him the second or third best ever, behind Kasparov but probably ahead of Karpov".[246]
Some grandmasters compared Fischer's play to that of a computer;[586][587] a player without noticeable weaknesses.[588]
Although international ratings were just introduced in 1970, Chessmetrics (a website that uses algorithms to rank performances retrospectively and uniformly throughout chess history) determined that Fischer's peak rating was 2895 in October 1971—the highest in history. His one-year peak (1971) average was 2881, the highest of all time. His three-year peak average was 2867, from January 1971 to December 1973—the second highest ever, just behind Garry Kasparov. Fischer was ranked as the number one player in the world for a total of 109 different months, running (not consecutively) from February 1964 until July 1974.[589]
Fischer's great rival Mikhail Tal praised him as "the greatest genius to have descended from the chess heavens".[590] American grandmaster Arthur Bisguier wrote "Robert James Fischer is one of the few people in any sphere of endeavour who has been accorded the accolade of being called a legend in his own time".[591] Former World Champion Tigran Petrosian stated that Fischer put more time into chess than the entire Soviet team.[592]
Faced with Fischer's extraordinary coolness, his opponents [sic] assurance would begin to disintegrate. A Fischer move, which at first glances looked weak, would be reassessed. It must have a deep master plan behind it, undetectable by mere mortals (more often than not they were right, it did). The U.S. grandmaster Robert Byrne labeled the phenomenon "Fischer-fear." Grandmasters would wilt, their suits would crumple, sweat would glisten on their brows, panic would overwhelm their nervous systems. Errors would creep in. Calculations would go awry. There was talk among grandmasters that Fischer hypnotized his opponents, that he undermined their intellectual powers with a dark, mystic, insidious force.
Kasparov wrote that Fischer "became the detonator of an avalanche of new chess ideas, a revolutionary whose revolution is still in progress".[594] In January 2009, reigning World Champion Viswanathan Anand described him as "the greatest chess player who ever lived".[595] Serbian grandmaster Ljubomir Ljubojević called Fischer, "A man without frontiers. He didn't divide the East and the West, he brought them together in their admiration of him".[512]
Fischer, who had taken the highest crown almost singlehandedly from the mighty, almost invincible Soviet chess empire, shook the whole world, not only the chess world, to its core. He started a chess boom not only in the United States and in the Western hemisphere, but worldwide. Teaching chess or playing chess as a career had truly become a respectable profession. After Bobby, the game was simply not the same.
Fischer was a charter inductee into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame in Washington, D.C. in 1985. After routing Taimanov, Larsen, and Petrosian in 1971, Fischer achieved a then-record Elo rating of 2785.[383][384] After beating Spassky by the score 12½–8½ in their 1972 match, his rating dropped to 2780.[384]
St. Louis philanthropist Rex Sinquefield offered a $64,000 Fischer Memorial Prize for any player who could win all nine of their games at the 2009 U.S. Chess Championship. By the fifth day of the championship, all 24 participants became ineligible for the prize, having drawn or lost at least one game.[596]
There were rumors that Fischer was playing on the online chess platform Internet Chess Club.[597] In 2001, Nigel Short wrote in The Sunday Telegraph chess column that he believed he had been secretly playing Fischer on ICC in speed chess matches.[598][599]
National Masters R.O. Mitchell[600] and Lionel Davis[601] both claimed to have played Fischer on ICC,[602] with Mitchell providing his alleged conversation with the supposed Fischer.[603] Chessbase.com did a study where they concluded that the user was a hoax, and not the real Bobby Fischer.[604]
The musical Chess, with lyrics by Tim Rice and music by Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, tells the story of two chess champions, referred to only as "The American" and "The Russian". The musical is loosely based on the 1972 World Championship match between Fischer and Spassky.[605]
During the 1972 Fischer–Spassky match, the Soviet bard Vladimir Vysotsky wrote an ironic two-song cycle "Honor of the Chess Crown". The first song is about a rank-and-file Soviet worker's preparation for the match with Fischer; the second is about the game. Many expressions from the songs have become catchphrases in Russian culture.[606]
The 1993 film Searching for Bobby Fischer uses Fischer's name in the title, even though the film is about the life of chess prodigy Joshua Waitzkin.[607] Outside of the United States, it was released as Innocent Moves.[608] The title refers to the search for Fischer's successor after his disappearance from competitive chess. The author feels that his son could be that successor. Fischer never saw the film and complained bitterly that it was an invasion of his privacy by using his name without his permission.[609] Fischer never received any compensation from the film, calling it "a monumental swindle".[610]
Bobby Fischer's Games of Chess (Simon and Schuster, New York, 1959). ISBN 0-923891-46-3. An early collection of 34 lightly annotated games, including the "Game of the Century" against Donald Byrne.
"The Russians Have Fixed World Chess" (Sports Illustrated magazine, August 1962). This is the controversial article in which Fischer asserted that several of the Soviet players in the 1962 Curaçao Candidates' tournament had colluded with one another to prevent he [Fischer] from winning the tournament.
"The Ten Greatest Masters in History" (Chessworld, Vol. 1, No. 1 (January–February 1964), pp. 56–61). An article in which Fischer named Paul Morphy, Howard Staunton, Wilhelm Steinitz, Siegbert Tarrasch, Mikhail Chigorin, Alexander Alekhine, José Raúl Capablanca, Boris Spassky, Mikhail Tal, and Samuel Reshevsky as the best players of all time.[611]
My 60 Memorable Games (Simon and Schuster, New York, 1969, and Faber and Faber, London, 1969; Batsford 2008 (algebraic notation)). "A classic of painstaking and objective analysis that modestly includes three of his losses".[612]
I Was Tortured in the Pasadena Jailhouse! (1982) a self-published "essay in a fourteen-page booklet" on Fischer's time in a Pasadena jail—he was "booked for vagrancy".[613]
Numerous books list Fischer as an author or endorser.[614] One such book is Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess,[615] co-authored by Donn Mosenfelder and Stuart Margulies.[616]
Donald Byrne–Fischer, New York 1956, Grünfeld, 5.Bf4 (D92), 0–1 "The Game of the Century". Chess magazine called this "a game of great depth and brilliancy".[625]
Robert Byrne–Fischer, 1963–64 U.S. Championship, Neo-Grünfeld 0–1 annotated From an almost symmetrical position, Fischer beats a strong grandmaster in just 21 moves—"a game that was immediately recognized as an all-time classic".[626]
Fischer–Tigran Petrosian, Buenos Aires Candidates Final 1971, 7th match game, Sicilian Defense: Kan. Modern Variation (B42), 1–0 This game includes "22 Nxd7+!!" which is "perhaps Fischer's most famous and instructive move and is still being cited today".[627]
Fischer–Boris Spassky, World Chess Championship 1972, 6th match game, Queen's Gambit Declined, Tartakower (D59), 1–0 Saidy called this game "[the] finest artistic achievement of the whole match".[628]
Boris Spassky-Fischer, World Chess Championship 1972, 13th match game, Alekhine Defense: Modern, Alburt Variation (B04), 0–1 Botvinnik called this game "the highest creative achievement of Fischer". He resolved a drawish opposite-colored bishops endgame by sacrificing his bishop and trapping his own rook. "Then five passed pawns struggled with the white rook. Nothing similar had been seen before in chess".[629]

 Evan Rachel Wood Sued for $30 Million for Leaving '10 Things I Hate About Life,’ Calls Suit ‘Preposterous’
          Bobby Fischer was the greatest American chess player in history and might have been the most talented chess player ever to play the game. His career and legacy were marred by eccentricities that developed into what likely was full-blown mental illness that made him an exile from his country of birth that he represented in the greatest proxy battle of the Cold War and from the game he loved.The chess legend was born Robert James Fischer on March 9, 1943 in Chicago to Regina Wender Fischer. His mother was a Jew who had been born in Switzerland but raised in St. Louis who became a naturalized U.S. citizen. The actual identity of his father is unknown. Regina listed German biophysicist Hans-Gerhardt Fischer, her first husband, as the father on Bobby's birth certificate, but they had been separated since 1939. Bobby's actual father likely was Hungarian physicist Paul Newmenyi, who like his mother, was Jewish. As his mental stability broke down late in life, Bobby became a vicious anti-Semite, insisting he wasn't Jewish.The young Bobby grew up without a father with his mother and older sister. It was his sister who whet his appetite for chess when she bought a chess set when Bobby was six year old. Reportedly possessed of a super genius I.Q. of 180, Bobby had a remarkably retentive memory. A monomaniac when it came to chess, his memory combined with an uncanny knack for the game and a determination to win transformed him into the greatest chess player in the world.Bobby became a National Master at the age of 12 and won America's Junior Chess Championship at the age of 13, making him the youngest Junior Champ in history. The 13 year-old Bobby defeated 26-year-old Donald Byrne, winner of America's chess championship, in a 1956 game heralded as "The Game of the Century." By this age, Fischer was showing gifts for improvisation and innovation that marked him as a chess genius.As a 14 year-old on the cusp of his 15th birthday, he won the U.S. Chess Championship in 1958, giving him the title of International Master. Later that same year, he broke future opponent Boris Spassky's record to become the youngest World Chess Federation Grand Master; Bobby was 15, and Boris was 18 when he set the distinction. The two names would become linked forever in chess history. (When the two first played each other in 1960, Fischer lost during an Argentine tournament, though the two tied and were co-winners of the tourney. He would not beat Spassky until their famous world title match in Iceland in 1972.)Bobby quit high school at the age of 16 to earn his daily bread by the sweat of his brow as a chess player. In a 1961 match against American champ Samuel Reshevsky, Bobby dropped out of the match claiming a scheduling dispute with the match organizer after tying Reshevsky in 11 games. Such eccentric behavior heralded his future.By '62, Fischer was considered the best non-Soviet chess player in the world. Bobby came to hate the Soviet players, who he claimed colluded with each other to him at a disadvantage. In 1966, Bobby placed second behind Boris Spassky in a super-tournament held in California. A year later, he withdrew from the tournament cycle that culminated in the World Championship, again over a scheduling dispute. The cycle ended in 1969 with Spassky crowned as the World Chess Champion.In 1968, Fischer began an 18-month-long sabbatical from the game, which included sitting out the '69 American Championship tournament as he was dissatisfied with the prize money and the tourney format. Failing to compete should have disqualified him from the 1969-72 Championship cycle, but he was able to compete for the world title when an American Grand Master surrendered his own spot for Fischer.Starting with the 1970 USSR v. Rest of the World tournament in which he beat former World Champion Tigran Petrosian, the master who had been defeated by Spassky in '69, Bobby began his march to the world championship. Through 1971, he had won 20 straight games in international tournament play, the second-longest win streak in the history of the game. Petrosian broke the streak but was in turn defeated by Fischer to win the right to challenge Spassky, a player he had never beaten, for the world title.Though he hated Soviet players for what he considered collusion (drawing matches between themselves so they could concentrate on beating non-Soviet players like Fischer), he liked and respected Boris Spassky. Spassky returned the affection and esteem.By 1972, he was in the position to make good his boast that he was the greatest chess player in the world. His difficult nature when it came to setting match and tournament conditions flared up again, and though he wanted to play in Yugoslavia, he accepted Spassky's suggestion of Iceland for the world title match. Negotiations were so prickly, President Richard Nixon's national security adviser, Henry Kissinger intervened, personally contacting Bobby to ensure that he did not drop out of the match, which was seen as a proxy battle in the ongoing Cold War between America and the Soviet Union.Though he later denounced the United States, at the time, Bobby embraced the Cold War rhetoric, declaring the match was "the free world against the lying, cheating hypocritical Russians."Held in Reykjavik, Iceland from July through September 1972, the drama of the world championship boosted the image and popularity of chess to new heights. Bobby lost the first two games, the first on a bad end move and the second by forfeit when he refused to participate. Because of his eccentric demands, he came close to forfeiting the match, but Spassky agreed to his demand to play in a new room with no TV cameras, the presence of which had upset Fischer.Fischer won the third game of the match, the first time he had beaten Boris Spassky in 12 years. For the rest of their play in 1972 and their 1992 rematch, Fischer never fell behind Spassky in terms of play or points. Spassky was baffled by Fischer's innovative moves, as he played new lines and combinations that Boris had never encountered before. Fischer won the match and became World Chess Champion by a score of 12.5 points to 8.5 on seven wins, one loss and 11 draws in 19 games.His championship was heralded by the U.S. media as a victory for the individualistic America over the collectivist U.S.S.R., whose players had dominated chess since the end of the Second World War. It was front page news, and it made Bobby Fischer a celebrity. He reportedly turned down a $1-million offer to endorse a chess set brand as he faded from the public spotlight.Fischer did not play competitively for the next three years, and in 1975, he forfeited his title by refusing to defend it when the World Chess Federation did not meet one or two of his many demands (estimated at between 64 and a hundred). The world title went to Anatoli Karpov by default, though Fischer continued to insisted he was the world chess champion.Fischer did not play competitively until 1992 when he met Boris Spassky for a rematch on the resort island of Sveti Stefan in in Montenegro, which was part of all that remained of Yugoslavia along with Serbia. The match was held in defiance of United Nations sanctions against Slobodan Miloseviæ's Serbia for war crimes.Bobby beat Boris, winning $3.35 million in prize money (approximately $5.65 million in 2012 dollar, when factored for inflation), but because the United States intended to enforce the U.N. sanctions, he had violated American law and could have served up to 10 years in jail upon returning to America. A defiant Fischer went into exile instead, living in Hungary before moving to the Philippines and then Japan.It was while living in the Philippines during the opening days of the new millennium that Bobby Fischer established himself as a world-class crank. After the 9/11 attacks on the United States, he praised the attacks and spewed forth anti-Semitic drivel on radio broadcasts. The Soviet hater of the Cold War era had become a rabid America hater and Jew-basher at the start of the global war on terror. His anti-Semitism became so extreme, he renamed himself "Robert James" and insisted he wasn't Jewish.During a stop-over in Japan, Fischer was arrested for traveling with an invalid U.S. passport. He promptly renounced his American citizenship. The arrest meant he could not leave Japan as he was a stateless person wanted by the United States. Facing a potential extradition to the country of his birth, Iceland came through and granted him citizenship, which allowed him to leave Japan. The country was still grateful for the publicity he had brought to its then-unknown capital of Reykjavik. Thus, Fischer moved to Iceland, the place where he had became part of not only chess lore, but of world historyBobby Fischer died on January 17, 2008 in Reykjavik after having been gravely ill. He made it to his 64th year, which was symbolic, as a chessboard has 64 squares.
      In 1953, he played his first chess tournament at the age of ten at the Brooklyn Chess Club Championship. He came in fifth place.
      Fischer was wanted in the United States for violating economic sanctions against the former Yugoslavia by playing a chess match there in 1992. He fled to Japan and was arrested in July 2004 for trying to leave Japan on a revoked U.S. passport. Thus, he was detained in Japan awaiting deportation to the United States. He renounced his U.S. citizenship and tried to become a German citizen, but was denied. Finally, in March 2005, Iceland's parliament voted to grant him Icelandic citizenship. He remained a fugitive in the U.S. until his death.
      Due to his anti-American and anti-Semitic statements, he became a controversial figure in the final decades of his life. He, for example, asked the editors of Encyclopedia Judaica to remove his name from the publication because he was, and has never been, Jewish (1984) and denied the Holocaust in several interviews. On a radio show shortly after the 9/11 attacks, he proclaimed them "a wonderful news" (2001).
      Born to Regina Wender, a naturalized American citizen of German Jewish descent, he was considered the son of her first husband, Hans-Gerhardt Fischer, a German biophysicist. They were married from 1933 to 1945, but some sources claim that his biological father was Hungarian physicist Paul Nemenyi.
Just a Few of the Countless Millions of People Who Would Be a Better Choice to Play Bobby Fischer than Tobey Maguire Is
=======================================================
Robert James (Bobby) Fischer was born at 2:39 pm on March 9, 1943 in Chicago, Illinois (Michael Reese hospital) to Regina Wender Fischer Pustan (born in Switzerland of Jewish parents on March 31, 1913) and Hans-Gerhardt Fischer (born September 28, 1908). His father was a German biophysicist from Berlin (Hans and Regina married on November 4, 1933 in Moscow) and his mother was a riveter in a defense plant at the time. She later became a grade school teacher, a registered nurse, a physician (she first entered medical school in the Moscow in 1933 but did not complete her medical degree), and completed a PhD in hematology. She went on to doing pro bono medical work for the poor in Central America and South America. She could speak English, French, German, Russian, Spanish, and Portuguese fluently.
In 1945 Hans-Gerhardt Fischer left the Fischer family and divorced Regina. He was born in Berlin in 1908. He moved to Santiago, Chile. Hans never lived with Regina in the United States. Bobby Fischer may have never met his father. There is a rumor that he did visit Chile to look for his father when he toured South America during a chess exhibition.  Regina had custody of Bobby and his older sister, Joan Fischer Targ (born in Moscow in 1938 and died on June 2, 1998 in Portala Valley, California of a cerebral hemorrhage).
In 1949 they moved to Brooklyn, New York where Regina worked as an elementary school teacher and nurse at Prospect Heights Hospital in Brooklyn. Regina moved to Brooklyn (Apt Q, 560 Lincoln Place) to get her master's degree in nursing.
In May 1949, Bobby 9 (age 6) and Joan (age 11) learned how to play chess from instructions found in a chess set that Joan bought at a candy store below their apartment. Bobby saw his first chess book a month later. For over a year Bobby played and studied chess by himself.
On November 14, 1950 his mother sent an ad to the Brooklyn Eagle, looking for chess opponents for her son. The ad was never published because the editorial staff could not decide under what category to place it. The paper then forwarded the ad to Hermann Helms (1870-1963), their chess columnist from 1893 to 1955. He replied in January, 1951, and suggested that Bobby go to a chess exhibition at the Grand Army Plaza Library and come by the Brooklyn Chess Club.
On January 17, 1951 Bobby, age 7, played a game against Senior Master Max Pavey (1918-1957) who was giving a simultaneous exhibition at the Grand Army Plaza Library in Brooklyn. Bobby lost in 15 minutes. Another player, Edmar Mednis (1937-2002), age 14, also participated in this simul and drew. Max Pavey's 1950 USCF rating was 2442 (#15 in the US). Watching in the crowd was Carmine Nigro (1910-2001), Secretary and President of the Brooklyn Chess Club. After the game, Carmine (rated 2028) went up to Bobby and invited him to join his club. Carmine Nigro had been an accomplished band leader in the 1940s and was a stockbroker before becoming a teaching golf pro.
A few weeks later Bobby joined the Brooklyn Chess Club, headed by Carmine Nigro. Bobby showed up and played chess at the Brooklyn Chess Club almost every Friday night. Bobby later started playing chess at Nigro's house on the weekends and often went with him to play chess at Washington Square Park in Manhattan. Carmine Nigro was Bobby Fischer's only chess instructor.
Regina was worried about her son's obsession with chess and took him to the Children's Psychiatric Division of the Brooklyn Jewish Hospital. Bobby was seen by Dr. Harold Kline who told Regina that there were worse preoccupations, and not to worry about it.
In 1952, Bobby played in his first chess tournament at the Nigro home, winning his match. Fischer's mother wrote to Paul Nemenyi that the family was too poor to even afford to patch Bobby's torn shoes. Paul Nemenyi may have been Bobby Fischer's real biological father. He died in 1952 of a heart attack in Washington, DC at the age of 56. He had been paying child support to Regina Fischer until his death.
In 1953 Bobby was playing at the Brooklyn Central YMCA. In February 1953, Bobby played in his first organized tournament, the Brooklyn Chess Club championship, and tied for 3rd-5th place.
In 1954 Bobby, age 11, was playing a lot of chess at the Brooklyn Chess Club and Brooklyn YMCA. He was exposed to international chess when Nigro took Fischer to watch the USA-USSR chess match every day at the Hotel Roosevelt in Manhattan. It was held June 16-24, 1954. In December, 1954 he again took 3rd-5th place at the Brooklyn Chess Club. It was during this period that Fischer later said "just got good" when describing when his chess improved.
In early 1955 Fischer was playing in a Chess Review correspondence tournament (section 54-P-38-100). He had a 1198 postal rating in 1955 and a 1082 postal rating in 1956. He lost his only known postal game in 12 moves (A. Wayne Conger-Fischer, corr. 1955). Donald Reithel recalls that he played Fischer in a correspondence game in 1955. Fischer wrote to Reithel that he was a Brooklyn Dodger fan. Fischer did not finish the correspondence game with Reithel because he was starting to play in over-the-board tournaments.
On May 21-23 (Memorial Day weekend), 1955, Fischer played in his first US Chess Federation tournament. He scored 3 points (out of 6) in the U.S.Amateur Championship in Lake Mohegan, New York (played at the Mohegan Country Club). His post-tournament provisional USCF rating was 1826. Carmine Nigro took him to the event. Fischer, age 12, only wanted to watch, but was persuaded to play by Nigro. The only known Fischer game from this event was Humphrey-Fischer in round 6. Fischer drew that game. Fischer won 2, drew 2, and lost 2. He tied for 33rd place. The event was won by Clinton L. Parmalee and organized by Kenneth Harkness (1896-1972). There were 57 entrants. The event was open to anyone except rated masters.
In June, 1955 Bobby scored 4.5-3.5 in a Washington Square Park (Greenwich Village) 8 round Swiss tournament with 32 players. He tied for 15th place.
He joined the Manhattan chess club in June, 1955 and soon won the class C championship and the class B championship.
On July 3, 1955, Regina Fischer sent a postcard to Alexander Liepnieks (1910-1973) and asked if he could make any arrangements for Bobby Fischer to play in the US Junior Championship in Lincoln, Nebraska. Lipenicks was the Nebraska State Champion at the time and organizer for the US Junior Championship.
In July of 1955, Fischer (age 12) and Charles Kalme (1939-2002) took a train from Philadelphia to Lincoln, Nebraska to play in the 10th annual US Junior Championship, organized by Alexander Liepenieks. The event was held July 15-24, 1955. Fischer won 2 games, drew 6 games, and lost 2 games at the U.S. Junior Championship in Lincoln, Nebraska (held at the local YMCA). Fischer took 11th-21st place out of 25. Kalme (rated 2186) won the event at age 15. Fischer stayed with the Liepnieks family. Fischer's USCF rating was 1625 after this event.
In round 1 of the US Junior Championship, Fischer lost to Kenneth Warner (1550). In round 2 he drew with William Whisler (unrated). In round 3 he beat Jimmy Thomason (1600). In round 4 he drew with David Ames (unrated). In round 5 he drew with Kenneth Stone (1600). In round 6 he drew with John Briska (unrated). In round 7 he lost to Viktors Pupols (2027) on time.
On July 17, 1955, he took 3rd place in the U.S. Junior Speed Championship preliminaries, behind Cross and Gross.
On November 26, 1955, Fischer, age 12, gave his first simultaneous exhibition He played 12 members of the Yorktown, Chess Club (Yorktown Heights, New York) youth group at the Manhattan Chess Club. He won all 12 games in 2 hours and 20 minutes. He received a watch from the Manhattan Chess Club and a check from the Yorktown Chess Club. Fischer was mentioned in the December, 1955 issue of Chess Life for his simul exhibition.
At the end of the year, Fischer two USCF ratings, 1826 and 1625, were averaged. So at the end of 1955, Bobby Fischer's USCF rating was published at 1726.
The January 1956 issue of Chess Review had Fischer on the cover giving a simul at the Manhattan Chess Club against the Yorktown Chess Club youth group.
In January 1956, Bobby won the class B prize of the first Greater New York City Open (January 21-26, 1956). It was held at the Churchill Chess and Bridge Club in Manhattan. The event was won by Bill Lombardy. Fischer won 5 games and lost 2 games. There were 52 players in this event. Fischer tied for 5th-7th. His USCF rating for the event was 2157.
Fischer was a member of the West Orange, New Jersey Log Cabin Chess Club. The club was founded and run by Forry Laucks (1897-1965).
In February 1956, Bobby traveled with the Log Cabin Chess Club to Cuba and even gave a simultaneous exhibition at the Capablanca Chess Club (winning 10 and drawing 2). His mother accompanied him and served as photographer for Chess Review. The Log Cabin Chess Club and Fischer also visited Philadelphia; St. Petersburg, Florida; Hollywood, Florida; Miami, Florida; Tampa, Florida; and Clinton, NC for simultaneous exhibitions. Norman Whitaker played board 1 for the Log Cabin Chess Club and Fischer played board 2. Fischer won 5, lost 1, and drew 1 during this exhibition match as board 2.
In April he won the class A championship at the Manhattan Chess Club. He won 7, drew 1, lost 2. He also was the top scorer in the Metropolitan League A team with 4 wins and 1 draw. At the end of April, his USCF rating was 2168.

I therefore resign my FIDE World Championship title."
In 1974, Fischer wrote to Larry Evans about not counting draws in a match. Larry Evans wrote: "The whole idea of not counting draws is to eliminate a draw match." Fischer responded: "Nonsense! The whole idea is to make sure the players draw blood by winning games, and the spectators get their money's worth. And most importantly as an accurate test of who is the world's best player."
In January, 1975, the Philippines were offering $5 million for Fischer to play Karpov in the Philippines.

In May, 2002 Frank Berry posted an Internet article in ChessCafe entitled, "Was Fischer's mother a Communist Spy?" He implied that Bobby Fisher's mother was a communist spy and that his father may have been a leading German spy.
In November, 2002, the Philadelphia Inquirer published a story that identifies the real father of Bobby Fischer. The article identifies the real father to be Paul Nemenyi, a Hungarian physicist. He died in 1952. He was at the University of Chicago in 1942 working on the Manhattan Project to develop the first nuclear bomb. Paul Nemenyi worked on the mechanism which triggered the atomic bomb. Bobby was born in Chicago on March 9, 1943. Russell Targ, Bobby's brother-in-law, disputes this suggestion that Nemenyi was Fischer's real father. Hans-Gerhardt Fischer is listed on Bobby's birth certificate.
On December 11, 2003 the U.S. Embassy in Manila sent a letter by the U.S. Consul General (Thomas Allegra) to the Japanese authorities that Fischer's U.S. passport (#27792702) had been revoked pursuant to Section 51.70(a) (Denial of Passports) of Title 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Fischer was still being charged with violating Title 50, US Code 1701, 1702, and 1705 and Executive Order 12810.

On July 13, 2004 at about 5:30 pm, Bobby Fischer was arrested by the Japanese immigration authorities at Narita International Airport in Tokyo, Japan during a rough struggle. Fischer was headed to Manila, Philippines at the time on a Japan Airlines flight (JL 745). He was then going to fly to Hong Kong. Fischer was told that he would be deported to the United States to face charges. Japan and the United States have an extradition treaty. Fischer could go to prison for 10 years and pay a $250,000 fine for violating the Trading with the Enemy Act and income tax evasion. Fischer was going to Baguio, Philippines to give another radio interview for Radio Bomba.
After two weeks of incarceration, he agreed to hire a lawyer (Masako Suzuki and Takeshi O'Hashi) to appeal the Japanese government's decision to deport him. He has been telling Japanese authorities that he is a German citizen, invoking his lineage to a German-born father (Hans-Gerhardt Fischer, born in Berlin in 1908).

In September, 2004, a Japanese court granted an injunction preventing Fischer from being deported until it had ruled on his lawsuit seeking to have the deportation order thrown out.
In January, 2005, Fischer wrote a letter to the government of Iceland, asking for Icelandic citizenship. The Icelandic authorities granted him an alien's passport, but that was insufficient for the Japanese government to release him. So the Icelandic government unanimously granted Fischer full citizenship in March, 2005. The U.S. government filed charges of tax evasion against Fischer in an effort to prevent him from traveling to Iceland.
In December, 2005, eBay opened a bid on Bobby Fischer's belongings that had been stored in a Pasadena storage lot. The starting bid was $15,000, but, so far, there have been no offers.

Bobby FischerChess PlayerBorn: 9 March 1943Died: 17 January 2008Birthplace: Chicago, IllinoisBest known as: The American chess champ who beat Boris Spassky in 1972The first American ever to become world chess champion, Bobby Fischer was as famous for his personality quirks as for his genius.  He grew up in Brooklyn, learned to play chess at age 6 and quickly became a prodigy; he was only 15 when reached International Grandmaster level in August 1958.  He fought a memorable and tumultuous battle against the Russian chess champion Boris Spassky in Reykjavik, Iceland in 1972, beating Spassky in 21 games to become world champion.  But Fischer was already a somewhat eccentric figure, increasingly reclusive and prone to haggling over minor points of lighting and other match conditions.  He never defended his crown, refusing a 1975 match against the International Chess Federation challenger, Anatoly Karpov.  The ICF awarded the title to Karpov and Fischer dropped from sight for nearly two decades.  He resurfaced in 1992 to play Spassky in a multi-million dollar rematch in Belgrade, thereby defying U.S. sanctions against Yugoslavia.  He won the match (and $3.5 million), but spent the next decade as a reclusive, cranky and somewhat mysterious figure who was regarded as a fugitive by American authorities.  On 16 July 2004, Fischer was arrested at Tokyo's Narita Airport on a charge of trying to leave Japan without a valid passport. He was detained by the Japanese until March of 2005, when he was granted citizenship by Iceland and was deported to his new home country, where he died in 2008.Extra credit: Fischer's books included Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess (1966) and My 60 Memorable Games (1969)... The 1993 movie Searching for Bobby Fischer was not about Fischer himself, but rather was a drama about a young chess whiz, based on the story of real-life chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin.Copyright © 1998-2014			by Who2?, LLC.

Is it possible for someone to be extremely intelligent and creative in a certain field and at the same time, in other respects, to be simple minded? The answer is yes.
Consider Isaac Newton. He was certainly a genius in the fields of mathematics and physics. On the other hand he devoted most of his life to studying the prophecies of the Bible, calculating the year in which God created the entire universe in six days, and determining the probable year that Jesus would return!
Consider Arthur Conan Doyle. He was a brilliant writer, creator of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, yet he firmly believed in the reality of fairies. He even wrote an entire book defending the authenticity of several crude photographs of the tiny winged fairies taken by two little girls.
My third example is Bobby Fischer, perhaps the greatest chess player of all time, certainly the best known. I have written elsewhere about Newton and Doyle. Here I will tell briefly the sad story of Fischer.
Robert James Fischer was born in Chicago in 1943 the illegitimate son of Jewish parents. His Polish mother, Regina, was an active Communist and a great admirer of the Soviet Union. She had a brief affair with Bobby’s German father.
Bobby grew up in Brooklyn. At age six he became captivated by chess. At fourteen he was the U.S. chess champion. The following year he was declared a grandmaster. In 1972 he became world champion by defeating Boris Spassky at a tournament in Iceland. There is not the slightest doubt that Bobby was a genius, with a mind that could have made him a great mathematician had events in his childhood taken a different turn.
Aside from chess, Fischer came close to being a moron. I once thought his refusal to play chess on Saturday was because he was Jewish. No, it was because he had become a convert to the Worldwide Church of God, a strange sect founded by former Seventh-day Adventist Herbert W. Armstrong. Like the Adventists, Armstrong believed that Saturday is still the God-appointed Sabbath. In 1972 Bobby gave $61,000 to Armstrong, part of the prize money he had won by defeating Spassky.
The Worldwide Church of God was soon scandalized by the womanizing of Herbert’s son Garner Ted. After being excommunicated by his father, Ted moved to Tyler, Texas, where he continued to preach his father’s doctrines. Disenchanted by this rift in the Worldwide Church—and on one occasion physically assaulting a lady official of the church—Fischer left the fold to become an ardent admirer of Hitler and the Nazis!
Fischer’s hatred of Jews turned paranoid. Pictures of Hitler decorated his lodgings. He denied the Holocaust. America, he was convinced, had fallen into the hands of “stinking Jews.” When the September 11, 2001, attacks occurred, he called it “wonderful news.” Wanted by the U.S. government for violating an order not to play a return match with Spassky in Yugoslavia, Fischer renounced his U.S. citizenship and settled in Iceland.
In 1972, in Helsinki, Bobby Fischer broke twenty-four years of Soviet dominance by defeating Boris Spassky.
Fischer died of kidney failure in 2008. His Japanese wife, Myoko Wakai, flew to Iceland for the funeral. A devout Buddhist and the woman’s chess champion of Japan, she and Fischer were legally married after living together for a short period. Presumably she will inherit Fischer’s sizeable fortune.
John Carlin, in an article titled “The End Game of Bobby Fischer” in the Observer/Guardian (February 10, 2008), described Fischer, during his final years, as looking like a homeless bum. “His teeth were rotten, and his white hair and beard were long and unkempt.” Bobby had a low opinion of doctors and dentists. He had all the metal fillings in his teeth removed because he thought radiation from them was injuring his health, or perhaps American or Russian enemies were causing the harmful radiation from his molars. Fischer seldom changed his clothes or removed his baseball cap. After his death in 2008 at age sixty-four, he was buried late one night near a tiny church in Iceland. A brief, shabby funeral was attended by a Catholic priest he had never known.
Fischer had an older sister, Joan, who died a few years earlier. She was the wife of Russell Targ, the physicist and parapsychologist whose chief claim to fame is having validated the psychic powers of Uri Geller.
