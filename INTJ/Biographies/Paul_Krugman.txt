Paul Robin Krugman (born February 28, 1953) is an American economist, Professor of Economics and International Affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, Centenary Professor at the London School of Economics, and an op-ed columnist for The New York Times.[2][3] In 2008, Krugman won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his contributions to New Trade Theory and New Economic Geography. According to the prize Committee, the prize was given for Krugman's work explaining the patterns of international trade and the geographic concentration of wealth, by examining the effects of economies of scale and of consumer preferences for diverse goods and services.[4]
Krugman is known in academia for his work on international economics (including trade theory, economic geography, and international finance),[5][6] liquidity traps, and currency crises. Krugman is ranked among the most influential economic thinkers in the US.[7]
Krugman has written over 20 books, including scholarly works, textbooks and books for a more general audience, and has published over 200 scholarly articles in professional journals and edited volumes.[8] He has also written more than 750 columns on economic and political issues for The New York Times, Fortune and Slate.
As a commentator, Krugman has written on a wide range of economic issues including income distribution, taxation, macroeconomics and international economics. Krugman considers himself a liberal, calling one of his books and his New York Times blog The Conscience of a Liberal.[9] His popular commentary has attracted considerable comment, both positive and negative.[10]
Krugman is the son of Anita and David Krugman (1924–2013). His paternal grandparents immigrated from Brest, Belarus, then Poland, to the United States in 1922.[11] He was born in Albany, New York, and grew up in Nassau County.[12] He graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore.[13]
According to Krugman, his interest in economics began with Isaac Asimov's Foundation novels, in which the social scientists of the future use "psychohistory" to attempt to save civilization. Since "psychohistory" in Asimov's sense of the word does not exist, Krugman turned to economics, which he considered the next best thing.[14][15]
Krugman has been married twice. Robin L. Bergman, his first wife, is an award-winning designer/artist. He is currently married to Robin Wells, his second wife, an academic economist who has collaborated on textbooks with Krugman.[16][17][18] Krugman reports that he is a distant relative of conservative journalist David Frum.[19] He has described himself as a "Loner. Ordinarily shy. Shy with individuals."[20] He lives with his wife in Princeton, New Jersey.
On February 28, 2014, he announced that he will retire from Princeton University in June 2015, and become a professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and a distinguished scholar at the Graduate Center's Luxembourg Income Study Center.[21][22]
Krugman earned his B.A. summa cum laude in economics from Yale University in 1974 and his PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1977 with a thesis titled Essays on flexible exchange rates. While at MIT he was part of a small group of MIT students sent to work for the Central Bank of Portugal for three months in the summer of 1976, in the chaotic aftermath of the Carnation Revolution.[23] Krugman later praised his PhD thesis advisor, Rudi Dornbusch, as "one of the great economics teachers of all time", and that he "had the knack of inspiring students to pick up his enthusiasm and technique, but find their own paths".[24]
In 1978, Krugman presented a number of ideas to Dornbusch, who flagged as interesting the idea of a monopolistically competitive trade model. Encouraged, Krugman worked on it and later wrote, "[I] knew within a few hours that I had the key to my whole career in hand".[23] In that same year, Krugman wrote The Theory of Interstellar Trade, a tongue-in-cheek essay on computing interest rates on goods in transit near the speed of light. He says he wrote it to cheer himself up when he was "an oppressed assistant professor".[25]
Krugman joined the faculty of MIT in 1979. From 1982 to 1983, Krugman spent a year working at the Reagan White House as a staff member of the Council of Economic Advisers. He rejoined MIT as a full professor in 1984. Krugman has also taught at Stanford, Yale, and the London School of Economics.[26]
In 2000, Krugman joined Princeton University as Professor of Economics and International Affairs. He is also currently Centenary Professor at the London School of Economics, and a member of the Group of Thirty international economic body.[3] He has been a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research since 1979.[27] Krugman was President of the Eastern Economic Association in 2010.[28]
Paul Krugman has written extensively on international economics, including international trade, economic geography, and international finance. The Research Papers in Economics project ranks him among the world's most influential economists.[29] Krugman's International Economics: Theory and Policy, co-authored with Maurice Obstfeld, is a standard undergraduate textbook on international economics.[30] He is also co-author, with Robin Wells, of an undergraduate economics text which he says was strongly inspired by the first edition of Paul Samuelson's classic textbook.[31] Krugman also writes on economic topics for the general public, sometimes on international economic topics but also on income distribution and public policy.
The Nobel Prize Committee stated that Krugman's main contribution is his analysis of the effects of economies of scale, combined with the assumption that consumers appreciate diversity, on international trade and on the location of economic activity.[4] The importance of spatial issues in economics has been enhanced by Krugman's ability to popularize this complicated theory with the help of easy-to-read books and state-of-the-art syntheses. "Krugman was beyond doubt the key player in 'placing geographical analysis squarely in the economic mainstream' ... and in conferring it the central role it now assumes."[32]
Prior to Krugman's work, trade theory (see David Ricardo and Heckscher–Ohlin model) emphasized trade based on the comparative advantage of countries with very different characteristics, such as a country with a high agricultural productivity trading agricultural products for industrial products from a country with a high industrial productivity. However, in the 20th century, an ever larger share of trade occurred between countries with similar characteristics, which is difficult to explain by comparative advantage. Krugman's explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the Journal of International Economics, and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors economies of scale.[33] Consumers' preference for diversity explains the survival of different versions of cars like Volvo and BMW. However, because of economies of scale, it is not profitable to spread the production of Volvos all over the world; instead, it is concentrated in a few factories and therefore in a few countries (or maybe just one). This logic explains how each country may specialize in producing a few brands of any given type of product, instead of specializing in different types of products.
Krugman modeled a 'preference for diversity' by assuming a CES utility function like that in a 1977 paper by Avinash Dixit and Joseph Stiglitz.[34][35] Many models of international trade now follow Krugman's lead, incorporating economies of scale in production and a preference for diversity in consumption.[4][36] This way of modeling trade has come to be called New Trade Theory.[32]

Krugman's theory also took into account transportation costs, a key feature in producing the "home market effect", which would later feature in his work on the new economic geography. The home market effect "states that, ceteris paribus, the country with the larger demand for a good shall, at equilibrium, produce a more than proportionate share of that good and be a net exporter of it."[32] The home market effect was an unexpected result, and Krugman initially questioned it, but ultimately concluded that the mathematics of the model were correct.[32]
When there are economies of scale in production, it is possible that countries may become 'locked into' disadvantageous patterns of trade.[37] Nonetheless, trade remains beneficial in general, even between similar countries, because it permits firms to save on costs by producing at a larger, more efficient scale, and because it increases the range of brands available and sharpens the competition between firms.[38] Krugman has usually been supportive of free trade and globalization.[39][40] He has also been critical of industrial policy, which New Trade Theory suggests might offer nations rent-seeking advantages if "strategic industries" can be identified, saying it's not clear that such identification can be done accurately enough to matter.[41]
It took an interval of eleven years, but ultimately Krugman's work on New Trade Theory (NTT) converged to what is usually called the "new economic geography" (NEG), which Krugman began to develop in a seminal 1991 paper, "Increasing Returns and Economic Geography", published in the Journal of Political Economy.[42] In Krugman's own words, the passage from NTT to NEG was "obvious in retrospect; but it certainly took me a while to see it. ... The only good news was that nobody else picked up that $100 bill lying on the sidewalk in the interim."[43] This would become Krugman's most-cited academic paper: by early 2009, it had 857 citations, more than double his second-ranked paper.[32] Krugman called the paper "the love of my life in academic work."[44]
The "home market effect" that Krugman discovered in NTT also features in NEG, which interprets agglomeration "as the outcome of the interaction of increasing returns, trade costs and factor price differences."[32] If trade is largely shaped by economies of scale, as Krugman's trade theory argues, then those economic regions with most production will be more profitable and will therefore attract even more production. That is, NTT implies that instead of spreading out evenly around the world, production will tend to concentrate in a few countries, regions, or cities, which will become densely populated but will also have higher levels of income.[4][6]
Krugman has also been influential in the field of international finance. As a graduate student, Krugman visited the Federal Reserve Board, where Stephen Salant and Dale Henderson were completing their discussion paper on speculative attacks in the gold market. Krugman adapted their model for the foreign exchange market, resulting in a 1979 paper on currency crises in the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, which showed that misaligned fixed exchange rate regimes are unlikely to end smoothly: instead, they end in a sudden speculative attack.[45] Krugman's paper is considered one of the main contributions to the 'first generation' of currency crisis models,[46][47] and it is his second-most-cited paper (457 citations as of early 2009).[32]
In response to the global financial crisis of 2008, Krugman proposed, in an informal "mimeo" style of publication,[48] an "international finance multiplier", to help explain the unexpected speed with which the global crisis had occurred. He argued that when, "highly leveraged financial institutions [HLIs], which do a lot of cross-border investment [....] lose heavily in one market [...] they find themselves undercapitalized, and have to sell off assets across the board. This drives down prices, putting pressure on the balance sheets of other HLIs, and so on." Such a rapid contagion had hitherto been considered unlikely because of "decoupling" in a globalized economy.[49][50][51] He first announced that he was working on such a model on his blog, on October 5, 2008.[52] Within days of its appearance, it was being discussed on some popular economics-oriented blogs.[53][54] The note was soon being cited in papers (draft and published) by other economists,[55] even though it had not itself been through ordinary peer review processes.
Krugman has done much to revive discussion of the liquidity trap as a topic in economics.[56][57][58][59] He recommended pursuing aggressive fiscal policy and unconventional monetary policy to counter Japan's lost decade in the 1990s, arguing that the country was mired in a Keynesian liquidity trap.[60][61][62] The debate he started at that time over liquidity traps and what policies best address them continues in the economics literature.[63]
Krugman had argued in The Return of Depression Economics that Japan was in a liquidity trap in the late 1990s, since the central bank could not drop interest rates any lower to escape economic stagnation.[64] The core of Krugman's policy proposal for addressing Japan's liquidity trap was inflation targeting, which, he argued "most nearly approaches the usual goal of modern stabilization policy, which is to provide adequate demand in a clean, unobtrusive way that does not distort the allocation of resources."[62] The proposal appeared first in a web posting on his academic site.[65] This mimeo-draft was soon cited, but was also misread by some as repeating his earlier advice that Japan's best hope was in "turning on the printing presses", as recommended by Milton Friedman, John Makin, and others.[66][67][68]
Krugman has since drawn parallels between Japan's 'lost decade' and the late 2000s recession, arguing that expansionary fiscal policy is necessary as the major industrialized economies are mired in a liquidity trap.[69] In response to economists who point out that the Japanese economy recovered despite not pursuing his policy prescriptions, Krugman maintains that it was an export-led boom that pulled Japan out of its economic slump in the late-90s, rather than reforms of the financial system.[70]
Krugman was one of the most prominent advocates of the 2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence, so much so that economics commentator Noah Smith referred to it as the "Krugman insurgency."[71][72][73] In June 2012, Krugman and Richard Layard launched A manifesto for economic sense, where they call for greater use of fiscal stimulus policy to reduce unemployment and foster growth.[74] The manifesto received over four thousand signatures within two days of its launch, including from prominent economists,[75] and has attracted both positive and critical responses.[76][77]

Krugman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (informally the Nobel Prize in Economics), the sole recipient for 2008. This prize includes an award of about $1.4 million and was given to Krugman for his work associated with New Trade Theory and the New Economic Geography.[78] In the words of the prize committee, "By having integrated economies of scale into explicit general equilibrium models, Paul Krugman has deepened our understanding of the determinants of trade and the location of economic activity."[79]
1991, American Economic Association, John Bates Clark Medal.[80] Since it was awarded to only one person, once every two years (prior to 2009), The Economist has described the Clark Medal as 'slightly harder to get than a Nobel prize'.[81]
1998, Doctor honoris causa in Economics awarded by Free University of Berlin Freie Universität Berlin in Germany
2008, Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for Krugman's contributions to New Trade Theory.[86] He became the twelfth John Bates Clark Medal winner to be awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize.
2012, Doctor honoris causa from the Universidade de Lisboa, Universidade Técnica de Lisboa and Universidade Nova de Lisboa[87][88]
2014, recipient of the Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)'s James Joyce Award in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the economic sciences.[90]
2014, recipient of the Green Templeton College, Oxford's Sanjaya Lall Visiting Professorship of Business and Development, Trinity Term 2014, in recognition of his outstanding international reputation in scholarship and research in the field of Development Economics and Business .[91][92]
A May, 2011 Hamilton College analysis of 26 politicians, journalists, and media commentators who made predictions in major newspaper columns or television news shows from September 2007 to December 2008 found that Krugman was the most accurate. Only nine of the prognosticators predicted more accurately than chance, two were significantly less accurate, and the remaining 14 were no better or worse than a coin flip. Krugman was correct in 15 out of 17 predictions, compared to 9 out of 11 for the next most accurate media figure, Maureen Dowd. Krugman's result was found to be statistically significant at the p<0.001 level.[93] He has been humorously described as 'Krugtron the Invincible' by fellow economists in reference to this successful record.[94]
Foreign Policy named Krugman one of its 2012 FP Top 100 Global Thinkers "for wielding his acid pen against austerity".[95]
In the 1990s, besides academic books and textbooks, Krugman increasingly began writing books for a general audience on issues he considered important for public policy. In The Age of Diminished Expectations (1990), he wrote in particular about the increasing US income inequality in the "New Economy" of the 1990s. He attributes the rise in income inequality in part to changes in technology, but principally to a change in political atmosphere which he attributes to Movement Conservatives.
In September 2003, Krugman published a collection of his columns under the title, The Great Unraveling, about the Bush administration's economic and foreign policies and the US economy in the early 2000s. His columns argued that the large deficits during that time were generated by the Bush administration as a result of decreasing taxes on the rich, increasing public spending, and fighting the Iraq war. Krugman wrote that these policies were unsustainable in the long run and would eventually generate a major economic crisis. The book was a best-seller.[81][96][97]
In 2007, Krugman published The Conscience of a Liberal, whose title refers to Barry Goldwater's Conscience of a Conservative.[98] It details the history of wealth and income gaps in the United States in the 20th century. The book describes how the gap between rich and poor declined greatly in middle of the century, and then widened in the last two decades to levels higher even than in the 1920s. In Conscience, Krugman argues that government policies played a much greater role than commonly thought both in reducing inequality in the 1930s through 1970s and in increasing it in the 1980s through the present, and criticizes the Bush administration for implementing policies that Krugman believes widened the gap between the rich and poor.
Krugman also argued that Republicans owed their electoral successes to their ability to exploit the race issue to win political dominance of the South.[99][100] Krugman argues that Ronald Reagan had used the "Southern Strategy" to signal sympathy for racism without saying anything overtly racist,[101] citing as an example Reagan's coining of the term "welfare queen".[102]
In his book, Krugman proposed a "new New Deal", which included placing more emphasis on social and medical programs and less on national defense.[103] In his review of Conscience of a Liberal, the liberal journalist and author Michael Tomasky credited Krugman with a commitment "to accurate history even when some fudging might be in order for the sake of political expediency." [99] In a review for The New York Times, Pulitzer prize-winning historian David M. Kennedy stated, "Like the rants of Rush Limbaugh or the films of Michael Moore, Krugman's shrill polemic may hearten the faithful, but it will do little to persuade the unconvinced".[104]
In late 2008, Krugman published a substantial updating of an earlier work, entitled The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008. In the book, he discusses the failure of the United States regulatory system to keep pace with a financial system increasingly out-of-control, and the causes of and possible ways to contain the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s.
In 2012, Krugman published End This Depression Now!, a book which argues that looking at the available historical economic data, fiscal cuts and austerity measures only deprive the economy of valuable funds that can circulate and further add to a poor economy – people cannot spend, and markets cannot thrive if there is not enough consumption and there can not be sufficient consumption if there is large unemployment. He argues that while it is necessary to cut debt, it is the worst time to do so in an economy that has just suffered the most severe of financial shocks, and must be done instead when an economy is near full-employment when the private sector can withstand the burden of decreased government spending and austerity. Failure to stimulate the economy either by public or private sectors will only unnecessarily lengthen the current economic depression and make it worse.[105]
Martin Wolf has written that Krugman is both the "most hated and most admired columnist in the US".[106] Economist J. Peter Neary has noted that Krugman "has written on a wide range of topics, always combining one of the best prose styles in the profession with an ability to construct elegant, insightful and useful models."[107] Neary added that "no discussion of his work could fail to mention his transition from Academic Superstar to Public Intellectual. Through his extensive writings, including a regular column for The New York Times, monographs and textbooks at every level, and books on economics and current affairs for the general public ... he has probably done more than any other writer to explain economic principles to a wide audience."[107] Krugman has been described as the most controversial economist in his generation[108][109] and according to Michael Tomasky since 1992 he has moved "from being a center-left scholar to being a liberal polemicist."[99]
From the mid-1990s onwards, Krugman wrote for Fortune (1997–99)[27] and Slate (1996–99),[27] and then for The Harvard Business Review, Foreign Policy, The Economist, Harper's, and Washington Monthly. In this period Krugman critiqued various positions commonly taken on economic issues from across the political spectrum, from protectionism and opposition to the World Trade Organization on the left to supply side economics on the right.[110]
During the 1992 presidential campaign, Krugman praised Bill Clinton's economic plan in The New York Times, and Clinton's campaign used some of Krugman's work on income inequality. At the time, it was considered likely that Clinton would offer him a position in the new administration, but allegedly Krugman's volatility and outspokenness caused Clinton to look elsewhere.[108] Krugman later said that he was "temperamentally unsuited for that kind of role. You have to be very good at people skills, biting your tongue when people say silly things."[110][111] In a Fresh Dialogues interview, Krugman added, "you have to be reasonably organized...I can move into a pristine office and within three days it will look like a grenade went off."[112]
In 1999, near the height of the dot com boom, The New York Times approached Krugman to write a bi-weekly column on "the vagaries of business and economics in an age of prosperity."[110] His first columns in 2000 addressed business and economic issues, but as the 2000 US presidential campaign progressed, Krugman increasingly focused on George W. Bush's policy proposals. According to Krugman, this was partly due to "the silence of the media – those 'liberal media' conservatives complain about...."[110] Krugman accused Bush of repeatedly misrepresenting his proposals, and criticized the proposals themselves.[110] After Bush's election, and his perseverance with his proposed tax cut in the midst of the slump (which Krugman argued would do little to help the economy but substantially raise the fiscal deficit), Krugman's columns grew angrier and more focused on the administration. As Alan Blinder put it in 2002, "There's been a kind of missionary quality to his writing since then ... He's trying to stop something now, using the power of the pen."[110] Partly as a result, Krugman's twice-weekly column on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times has made him, according to Nicholas Confessore, "the most important political columnist in America... he is almost alone in analyzing the most important story in politics in recent years – the seamless melding of corporate, class, and political party interests at which the Bush administration excels."[110] In an interview in late 2009, Krugman said his missionary zeal had changed in the post-Bush era and he described the Obama administration as "good guys but not as forceful as I'd like...When I argue with them in my column this is a serious discussion. We really are in effect speaking across the transom here."[113] Krugman says he's more effective at driving change outside the administration than inside it, "now, I'm trying to make this progressive moment in American history a success. So that's where I'm pushing."[113]
Krugman's columns have drawn criticism as well as praise. A 2003 article in The Economist[114] questioned Krugman's "growing tendency to attribute all the world's ills to George Bush," citing critics who felt that "his relentless partisanship is getting in the way of his argument" and claiming errors of economic and political reasoning in his columns.[81] Daniel Okrent, a former The New York Times ombudsman, in his farewell column, criticized Krugman for what he said was "the disturbing habit of shaping, slicing and selectively citing numbers in a fashion that pleases his acolytes but leaves him open to substantive assaults."[115][116]
Krugman's New York Times blog is "The Conscience of a Liberal," devoted largely to economics and politics.
Five days after 9/11 terrorist attacks, Krugman argued in his column that calamity was "partly self-inflicted" due to transfer of responsibility for airport security from government to airlines. His column provoked an angry response and The New York Times was flooded with complaints. According to Larissa MacFarquhar of The New Yorker, while some people[who?] thought that he was too partisan to be a columnist for The New York Times, he was revered on the left.[117][118] Similarly, on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 on the United States Krugman again provoked a controversy by accusing on his New York Times blog former U.S. President George W. Bush and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani of rushing "to cash in on the horror" after the attacks and describing the anniversary as "an occasion for shame".[119][120]
In a 1994 Foreign Affairs article, Paul Krugman argued that it was a myth that the economic successes of the East Asian 'tigers' constituted an economic miracle. He argued that their rise was fueled by mobilizing resources and that their growth rates would inevitably slow.[121] His article helped popularize the argument made by Lawrence Lau and Alwyn Young, among others, that the growth of economies in East Asia was not the result of new and original economic models, but rather from high capital investment and increasing labor force participation, and that total factor productivity had not increased. Krugman argued that in the long term, only increasing total factor productivity can lead to sustained economic growth. Krugman's article was highly criticized in many Asian countries when it first appeared, and subsequent studies disputed some of Krugman's conclusions. However, it also stimulated a great deal of research, and may have caused the Singapore government to provide incentives for technological progress.[122]
During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Krugman advocated currency controls as a way to mitigate the crisis. Writing in a Fortune magazine article, he suggested exchange controls as "a solution so unfashionable, so stigmatized, that hardly anyone has dared suggest it."[123] Malaysia was the only country that adopted such controls, and although the Malaysian government credited its rapid economic recovery on currency controls, the relationship is disputed.[124] An empirical study found that the Malaysian policies produced faster economic recovery and smaller declines in employment and real wages.[125] Krugman later stated that the controls might not have been necessary at the time they were applied, but that nevertheless "Malaysia has proved a point—namely, that controlling capital in a crisis is at least feasible."[126] Krugman more recently pointed out that emergency capital controls have even been endorsed by the IMF, and are no longer considered radical policy.[127][128][129]
In the early 2000s, Krugman repeatedly criticized the Bush tax cuts, both before and after they were enacted. Krugman argued that the tax cuts enlarged the budget deficit without improving the economy, and that they enriched the wealthy – worsening income distribution in the US.[97][130][131][132][133] Krugman advocated lower interest rates (to promote investment and spending on housing and other durable goods), and increased government spending on infrastructure, military, and unemployment benefits, arguing that these policies would have a larger stimulus effect, and unlike permanent tax cuts, would only temporarily increase the budget deficit.[133][134]
In August 2005, after Alan Greenspan expressed concern over housing markets, Krugman criticized Greenspan's earlier reluctance to regulate the mortgage and related financial markets, arguing that "[he's] like a man who suggests leaving the barn door ajar, and then – after the horse is gone – delivers a lecture on the importance of keeping your animals properly locked up."[135] Krugman has repeatedly expressed his view that Greenspan and Phil Gramm are the two individuals most responsible for causing the subprime crisis. Krugman points to Greenspan and Gramm for the key roles they played in keeping derivatives, financial markets, and investment banks unregulated, and to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed Great Depression era safeguards that prevented commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies from merging.[136][137][138][139]
Krugman has also been critical of some of the Obama administration's economic policies. He has criticized the Obama stimulus plan as being too small and inadequate given the size of the economy and the banking rescue plan as misdirected; Krugman wrote in The New York Times: "an overwhelming majority [of the American public] believes that the government is spending too much to help large financial institutions. This suggests that the administration's money-for-nothing financial policy will eventually deplete its political capital."[140] In particular, he considered the Obama administration's actions to prop up the US financial system in 2009 to be impractical and unduly favorable to Wall Street bankers.[116] In anticipation of President Obama's Job Summit in December 2009, Krugman said in a Fresh Dialogues interview, "This jobs summit can't be an empty exercise...he can't come out with a proposal for $10 or $20 Billion of stuff because people will view that as a joke. There has to be a significant job proposal...I have in mind something like $300 Billion."[141]
Krugman has recently criticized China's exchange rate policy, which he believes to be a significant drag on global economic recovery from the Late-2000s recession, and he has advocated a "surcharge" on Chinese imports to the US in response.[142] Jeremy Warner of The Daily Telegraph accused Krugman of advocating a return to self-destructive protectionism.[143]
In April 2010, as the Senate began considering new financial regulations, Krugman argued that the regulations should not only regulate financial innovation, but also tax financial-industry profits and remuneration. He cited a paper by Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny released the previous week, which concludes that most innovation was in fact about "providing investors with false substitutes for [traditional] assets like bank deposits," and once investors realize the sheer number of securities that are unsafe a "flight to safety" occurs which necessarily leads to "financial fragility."[144][145]
In his June 28, 2010 column in The New York Times, in light of the recent G-20 Toronto Summit, Krugman criticized world leaders for agreeing to halve deficits by 2013. Krugman claimed that these efforts could lead the global economy into the early stages of a "third depression" and leave "millions of lives blighted by the absence of jobs." He advocated instead the continued stimulus of economies to foster greater growth.[146]
In a 2014 review of Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century he stated we are in a Second Gilded Age.[147]
Krugman identifies as a Keynesian[148] and a saltwater economist,[149] and he has criticized the freshwater school on macroeconomics.[150][151] Though he applies New Keynesian theory in some of his work, he has also criticized it for lacking predictive power and for hewing to ideas like the efficient-market hypothesis and rational expectations.[151] Since the 1990s, he has promoted the IS-LM model as invented by John Hicks, pointing out its relative simplicity compared to New Keynesianism and continued currency in practical economic policy.[152][153][154]
In the wake of the 2007–2009 financial crisis he has remarked that he is "gravitating towards a Keynes-Fisher-Minsky view of macroeconomics."[155] Post-Keynesian observers cite commonalities between Krugman's views and those of the Post-Keynesian school.[156][157] [158] In recent academic work, he has collaborated with Gauti Eggertsson on a New Keynesian model of debt-overhang and debt-driven slumps, inspired by the writings of Irving Fisher, Hyman Minsky, and Richard Koo. Their work argues that during a debt-driven slump, the "paradox of toil", together with the paradox of flexibility, can exacerbate a liquidity trap, reducing demand and employment.[159]
Krugman's support for free trade has provoked considerable ire from the anti-globalization movement.[160][161][162] He once famously quipped that, "If there were an Economist's Creed, it would surely contain the affirmations 'I understand the Principle of Comparative Advantage' and 'I advocate Free Trade'."[163][164] In the same article, Krugman argues that, given the findings of New Trade Theory, "[free trade] has shifted from optimum to reasonable rule of thumb...it can never again be asserted as the policy that economic theory tells us is always right." However, Krugman declares in favor of free trade given the enormous political costs of actively engaging in strategic trade policy (i.e. rent-seeking) and because there is no clear method for a government to discover which industries will ultimately yield positive returns. He also notes that increasing returns and strategic trade theory does not disprove the underlying truth behind comparative advantage.
Krugman describes himself as liberal, and has explained that he views the term "liberal" in the American context to mean "more or less what social democratic means in Europe."[98] In a 2009 Newsweek article, Evan Thomas described Krugman as having "all the credentials of a ranking member of the East coast liberal establishment" but also as someone who is anti-establishment, a "scourge of the Bush administration", and a critic of the Obama administration.[116] In 1996, Newsweek's Michael Hirsh remarked, "Say this for Krugman: though an unabashed liberal ... he's ideologically colorblind. He savages the supply-siders of the Reagan-Bush era with the same glee as he does the 'strategic traders' of the Clinton administration."[108]
Krugman has advocated free markets in contexts where they are often viewed as controversial. He has written against rent control in favor of supply and demand,[165] likened the opposition against free trade and globalization to the opposition against evolution via natural selection,[161] opposed farm subsidies,[166] argued that sweatshops are preferable to unemployment,[39] dismissed the case for living wages,[167] argued against mandates, subsidies, and tax breaks for ethanol,[168] and questioned NASA's manned space flights.[169] Krugman has also criticized U.S. zoning laws[170] and European labor market regulation.[171][172] He calls current Israeli policy "narrow-minded" and "basically a gradual, long-run form of national suicide", saying that it's "bad for Jews everywhere, not to mention the world".[173]
Krugman has criticized the Republican Party leadership for what he sees as a strategic (but largely tacit) reliance on racial divisions.[174][175][176] In his Conscience of a Liberal, he wrote
The changing politics of race made it possible for a revived conservative movement, whose ultimate goal was to reverse the achievements of the New Deal, to win national elections – even though it supported policies that favored the interests of a narrow elite over those of middle- and lower-income Americans.[177]
Krugman worked for Martin Feldstein when the latter was appointed chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and chief economic advisor to President Ronald Reagan. He later wrote in an autobiographical essay, "It was, in a way, strange for me to be part of the Reagan Administration. I was then and still am an unabashed defender of the welfare state, which I regard as the most decent social arrangement yet devised."[23] Krugman found the time "thrilling, then disillusioning". He did not fit into the Washington political environment, and was not tempted to stay on.[23]
According to Krugman, Gordon Brown and his party were unfairly blamed for the late-2000s financial crisis.[178] He has also praised the former British Prime Minister, whom he described as "more impressive than any US politician" after a three-hour conversation with him.[179] Krugman asserted that Brown "defined the character of the worldwide financial rescue effort" and urged British voters not to support the opposition Conservative Party in the 2010 General Election, arguing their Party Leader David Cameron "has had little to offer other than to raise the red flag of fiscal panic."[180][181]
In 2009, singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III wrote 'The Krugman Blues', a song in humorous praise of Krugman, released on the album 10 Songs for the New Depression.[183]
Krugman has popularized the phrase "Very Serious People" to mock pundits and politicians that hold mistaken beliefs but are still thought of as respectable.[184][185]

Paul Krugman joined The New York Times in 1999 as a columnist on the Op-Ed Page and continues as professor of Economics and International Affairs at Princeton University.
Mr. Krugman received his B.A. from Yale University in 1974 and his Ph.D. from MIT in 1977. He has taught at Yale, MIT and Stanford. At MIT he became the Ford International Professor of Economics.Mr. Krugman is the author or editor of 20 books and more than 200 papers in professional journals and edited volumes. His professional reputation rests largely on work in international trade and finance; he is one of the founders of the "new trade theory," a major rethinking of the theory of international trade. In recognition of that work, in 1991 the American Economic Association awarded him its John Bates Clark medal, a prize given every two years to "that economist under forty who is adjudged to have made a significant contribution to economic knowledge." Mr. Krugman's current academic research is focused on economic and currency crises. At the same time, Mr. Krugman has written extensively for a broader public audience. Some of his recent articles on economic issues, originally published in Foreign Affairs, Harvard Business Review, Scientific American and other journals, are reprinted in Pop Internationalism and The Accidental Theorist.

Paul Krugman has at least three jobs: he is professor of economics and international affairs at Princeton University, Centenary Professor at the London School of Economics, and, perhaps, his best-known job, as an op-ed columnist for The New York Times. In recognition of his influence The Washington Monthly called him "the most important political columnist in America."
In addition, Krugman's reputation extends well beyond the U.S. The Asia Times recently called him "the Mick Jagger of political/economic punditry." The Economist said he is "the most celebrated economist of his generation." In December 2008, Mr. Krugman received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for 2008, honoring his work in international trade patterns. Previously he was awarded what is understood to be the European Pulitzer Prize, the Asturias Award given by the King of Spain.
Krugman is the author or editor of 23 books and more than 200 professional journal articles, many of them on international trade and finance. In recognition of his work, he received the John Bates Clark Medal from the American Economic Association, an award given every two years to the top economist under the age of 40.
For more than 20 years, Krugman has written extensively for non-economists, including a monthly column, "The Dismal Science," for the on-line magazine Slate. He has also been a columnist for Fortune and has published articles in The New Republic, Foreign Policy, Newsweek, and The New York Times Magazine, before joining The New York Times.
Prior to his appointment at Princeton, Krugman served on the faculty of MIT; his last post was Ford International Professor of Economics. He has also taught at Yale and Stanford Universities, and prior to that he was the senior international economist for the President's Council of Economic Advisers, under Ronald Reagan. (Yes, he served under a conservative President.)
He is a Fellow of the Econometric Society, a Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research, and a member of the Group of Thirty. He has served as a consultant to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations, as well as to a number of countries including Portugal and the Philippines.
His most recent book is End This Depression Now! His previous work, The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008 was highly praised and became a New York Times bestseller in both hardcover and paperback.
=======================================================
Winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Economics. 2011 Gerald Loeb Award winner for Commentary — New York Times.
As one of the world’s most leading economists, Paul speaks on the lead issues of the day affecting the world economy. An insightful, outspoken Op-Ed columnist for the New York Times, he is a passionate and articulate speaker, with a gift for relating global economic events to his audiences, and committed to speaking the truth as he sees it in the most compelling terms.
His twice-weekly Op-Ed pieces for The New York Times model the depth of insight and the unflinchingly outspoken style he brings to his speeches.
The most recent of Professor Krugman’s many books, End This Depression Now!, is a call for action. In it, Paul has a powerful message for anyone who has suffered during the Great Recession — a quick, strong recovery is just one step away, if our leaders can find the "intellectual clarity and political will" to end this depression now.
His previous books include The Conscience of a Liberal, The Great Unraveling, a bestseller, and The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008, a response to the financial crisis, an updated edition of his 1999 book, The Return of Depression Economics.
In addition to the Nobel Prize, Krugman’s work in economics has earned him broad acclaim from the economic press and several prestigious awards, including the John Bates Clark medal from the American Economic Association for his work in international trade and finance. He is recognized worldwide as a leader in the fields of economic geography and the role of increasing returns in shaping international trade.
Paul Krugman is professor of economics at Princeton University. Over the course of 2014 and 2015 he will move to the Graduate Center at the City University of New York (CUNY), where he will become a Professor of Economics and a distinguished scholar at the Graduate Center’s Luxembourg Income Study Center.
He was chosen as one of Bloomberg’s 10 Most Influential Thinkers, 2013 and Bloomberg's 50 Most Influential People in Global Finance, 2011. He has been honored to be one of Foreign Policy's Top 100 Global Thinkers for four straight years (2009-2012).
Paul Krugman won the 2008 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his groundbreaking work on international trade and economic geography. (Here is a 
description in his own words of the work for which he won the Prize.) He is the author or editor of 20 books and more than 200 papers in professional journals and edited volumes. Professor Krugman is one of the founders of the "new trade theory," a major rethinking of the theory of international trade, for which he also received the John Bates Clark medal in 1991 from the American Economic Association, a prize given every two years to "that economist under forty who is adjudged to have made a significant contribution to economic knowledge."
He also is the leading pioneer in economic geography — the economic dynamics that determine how and why certain places (like Silicon Valley) end up specializing economically and the advantages this kind of clustering brings to companies and economies. For example, there has been no important commercial traffic on the Erie Canal since 1850, yet the head start that canal gave to New York City has allowed New York to remain the largest US city and its major commercial center to this day.
The overarching theme to his work: bringing the theory of increasing returns into the economic mainstream. ‘Increasing returns’ is the technical term for the phenomenon that success tends to breed further success—that economics is dynamic, not static, and that the multiple choices available to economies eventually get sorted out through the accumulation of initial advantages that may be accidents of history. He’s applied increasing returns theory to international trade and geographic clustering.
The Great Recession is more than four years old — and counting. Yet, as Paul Krugman points out in this powerful volley, "Nations rich in resources, talent, and knowledge — all the ingredients for prosperity and a decent standard of living for all — remain in a state of intense pain." 
How bad have things gotten? How did we get stuck in what now can only be called a depression? And above all, how do we free ourselves? Krugman pursues these questions with his characteristic lucidity and insight. He has a powerful message for anyone who has suffered over these past four years — a quick, strong recovery is just one step away, if our leaders can find the "intellectual clarity and political will" to end this depression now.
In 1999, in The Return of Depression Economics, Paul Krugman surveyed the economic crises that had swept across Asia and Latin America, and pointed out that those crises were a warning for all of us: like diseases that have become resistant to antibiotics, the economic maladies that caused the Great Depression were making a comeback. In the years that followed, as Wall Street boomed and financial wheeler-dealers made vast profits, the international crises of the 1990s faded from memory. But now depression economics has come to America: when the great housing bubble of the mid-2000s burst, the U.S. financial system proved as vulnerable as those of developing countries caught up in earlier crises and a replay of the 1930s seems all too possible.
In this new, greatly updated edition of The Return of Depression Economics, Krugman shows how the failure of regulation to keep pace with an increasingly out-of-control financial system set the United States, and the world as a whole, up for the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s. He also lays out the steps that must be taken to contain the crisis, and turn around a world economy sliding into a deep recession. Brilliantly crafted in Krugman's trademark style — lucid, lively, and supremely informed — this new edition of The Return of Depression Economics will become an instant cornerstone of the debate over how to respond to the crisis.
This wholly original new work by the best-selling author of The Great Unraveling challenges America to reclaim the values that made it great.
With this major new volume, Paul Krugman, "the heir apparent to Galbraith" (Alan Blinder) and, today's most widely read economist, studies the past eighty years of American history, from the reforms that tamed the harsh inequality of the Gilded Age to the unraveling of that achievement and the reemergence of immense economic and political inequality since the 1970s. Seeking to understand both what happened to middle-class America and what it will take to achieve a "new New Deal," Krugman has created his finest book to date, a work that weaves together a nuanced account of three generations of history with sharp political, social, and economic analysis. This book, written with Krugman's trademark ability to explain complex issues simply, will transform the debate about American social policy in much the same way as did John Kenneth Galbraith's deeply influential book, The Affluent Society.
This national bestseller from one of our most important political commentators chronicles the dangers of an administration that has raised dishonesty to dizzying heights. Award-winning economist Paul Krugman exposes the devastating facts that speak for themselves. From identifying the flaws in George W. Bush's economic plans to telling the story behind California's energy crisis, to revealing the administration's reasons for going to war in Iraq, Krugman offers compelling justification for his criticisms and sets the first years of the twenty-first century in a stark new light. This up-to-date edition includes a new introduction and other material that reflect the events of 2004.
Surely the Great Depression could not happen again; our economists and policy makers simply have too many tools in their kit and too much experience applying them. Or could it? First it was Asia, in July 1997, when a series of event led to the collapse of six economies including Japan. Then came the failure of the Russian economy, followed by the Federal Reserve Board's bailout here in the United States of the over-leveraged Long Term Capital Management Corporation. In early 1999 it was Brazil's turn, with its own currency crisis. In the 1930s policy makers realized that they had to limit the free market in order to save it. Today, when governments worldwide have spent decades lifting regulatory restraints on trade within and across their borders, interference in markets is completely out of favor as a policy tool. With his usual creativity and willingness to consider new ideas, Krugman suggests that a variety of capital restraints may well be in order. This book is for anyone with any level of economic background who wishes to understand the stunning events in today's global economy.
In this wonderfully cohesive set of sharp and witty essays, Paul Krugman tackles bad economic ideas from across the political spectrum. In plain English, he enlightens us on the Asian crisis, corporate downsizing, and the globalization of the American economy, among other topics. The writing here brilliantly combines the acerbic style and clever analysis that has made Krugman famous. Imagine declaring New York its own country and you get a better picture of our trade balance with China and Hong Kong. Try reducing the economy to the production of hot dogs and buns and you'll understand why common beliefs about the impact of production efficiency on labor demand are wrong. This is a collection that will amuse, provoke, and enlighten, in classic Paul Krugman style.
Paul tailors each presentation to the needs of his audience and is not limited to the topics we have listed below. These are subjects that have proven valuable to customers in the past and are meant only to suggest his range and interests. Please ask us about any subject that interests you; we are sure that we can accommodate you.
Paul Krugman was brilliant, one of the best speakers my client has ever had. Many thanks for your help. 
The talk went very well from our perspective. The turnout was awesome, so people occupied every possible perch for sitting in our library. Krugman was very gracious to spend the great majority of the time responding to questions, and he was very engaging, candid, and humorous. The students and faculty LOVED hearing from him, and his visit seemed to revitalize the Policy program. I've adopted quasi-celebrity status here because I made it possible for Krugman to come. So, thanks again for all your help!!
Well, Krugman pulled in the largest audience of this semester and probably almost as large as any audience we have had — somewhere between 1,000 and 1,100. He was amazing, funny, witty, frightening, you name it. He was also totally unassuming.      
What really made us pleased is the wide diversity of the audience — lots of students, campus people, and community. It was truly amazing.
It was a big success! The lecture was great and the house was packed. We had to turn away some people but not too many — so a good 1000 people were there for the lecture. Paul was wonderful, as you know, very articulate and amazing. Thanks so much for everything. We are so pleased with his visit!
The Great Recession is more than four years old — and counting. Yet, as Paul Krugman points out in this powerful volley, "Nations rich in resources, talent, and knowledge — all the ingredients for prosperity and a decent standard of living for all — remain in a state of intense pain."

Who Is Paul Krugman?:Paul Krugman is a controversial and influential economics columnist for The New York Times. He is also a professor of Economics and International Affairs at Princeton University. He won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his formulating "New Trade Theory." He is the author or editor of 20 books, including Principles of Economics, The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008 and The Conscience of a Liberal.Why Is Paul Krugman Important to the U.S. Economy?:New Trade Theory explains why countries (like Sweden) with a large domestic market for a product, (like a Volvo) develop a comparative advantage in that product. This helps them become a leading exporter of that product to similar countries (like the U.S.). This led to a second theory that says the areas that have large domestic markets and exports will be more profitable and attract even more production. This is why production is concentrated in just a few, large countries. The cities within those countries become densely populated, attracting workers and consumers, thus making those countries even more successful.Krugman's Blog:Paul Krugman's blog, The Conscience of a Liberal, is one of the most-quoted and widely-referred-to blogs in the econoblogosphere.  For example, in 2008 he predicted that highly leveraged banks with a lot of international investments would spread their collapse across borders very rapidly. Until then, everyone thought the crisis would be contained to the U.S. or England. Within days of announcing his theory in his blog, it was discussed by most econoblogs.Like most economists, Krugman is not always right. In early 2010, he predicted there was a 40% chance the economy was headed for a double-dip recession by the second half of the year. He based this prediction on the tightening monetary and fiscal policy. He thought that the Fed's exit plan combined with the end of stimulus spending would take the training wheels off of the shaky economic recovery. Fortunately, he wasn't right on this one. In fact, the economy grew 2.5% in the third quarter, and 2.3% in the fourth quarter. (See GDP Current Statistics)Krugman's popularity is a result of his direct and accessible writing and speaking style, as well as his credentials and innovative thinking.Krugman's Early Career:Krugman received his B.A. from Yale University in 1974 and his Ph.D. from MIT in 1977. He has taught at Yale, MIT and Stanford. At MIT he became the Ford International Professor of Economics.

Paul Krugman, Nobel Laureate Economist:Dr. Paul Krugman, American economist, bestselling author and respected professor, was awarded the prestigious 2008 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. Krugman's expertise is in international economics, including finance, trade theory and economic geography.
Through his New York Times column and related blog, The Conscience of a Liberal, Krugman, an avowed liberal progressive, is an influential, outspoken opinion leader on the intersection of politics and the economy. His writings are plain-spoken, witty and accessible for all informed readers, not merely economists. Krugman, Outspoken Progressive Partisan:During the 2008 Democratic primaries, Krugman first supported universal health care and other policies promulgated by former Sen. John Edwards. Once Edwards dropped out, Krugman supported Hillary Clinton's health care and economic proposals.
Krugman has consistently been critical of Obama as too willing to compromise vital progressive values for the unnecessary sake of bipartisanship and bland centrism. On Feb 9, 2009, Krugman lamented that stimulus legislation is inadequate, writing "I blame President Obama’s belief that he can transcend the partisan divide — a belief that warped his economic strategy."
Krugman on Trade:Krugman received the Nobel Prize for his analysis of international trade, which he first described in 1979. Put simply, he debunked the myth that modern trade occurs mainly between economically unequal countries. Instead, trade occurs between relative equals as consumers demand a diversity of product choice, which can lead to efficient economies of scale in industrial production.
A proponent of globalized free trade, Krugman's theories are the basis of New Trade Theory, which is the model of most international trade today. (See Pros & Cons of Free Trade Agreements.)
Krugman on Depression Economics:In his 2008 book "The Return of Depression Economics" and in the New York Times on Nov 14, 2008, Krugman penned, "We are already, however, well into the realm of what I call depression economics. By that I mean a state of affairs like that of the 1930s in which the usual tools of economic policy — above all, the Federal Reserve’s ability to pump up the economy by cutting interest rates — have lost all traction. When depression economics prevails, the usual rules of economic policy no longer apply: virtue becomes vice, caution is risky and prudence is folly."
Krugman has also taught at the London School of Economics, University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University and Yale University. Other Accolades & Associations:Paul Krugman served from 1982-1983 as a staff member of Ronald Reagan's White House Council of Economic Advisors.

=======================================================
Paul Krugman is an American economist and professor of economics at Princeton University. He is a leading liberal voice in American policy debate and has been labelled one of the most influential academic thinkers in America. He was awarded the Nobel  Prize for economics in 2008 in recognition for his work on international economics.
Krugman was born in Albany, New York on February 28, 1953 and grew up in Nassau county. He went to John F.Kennedy High School in Bellmore, before graduating with a B.A. summa cum laude in economics from Yale University in 1974. 
Krugman did a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1977, under the guidance of his thesis advisor Rudi Dornbusch. In the late 1970s, Krugman began working on international trade and a new model of monopolistic competition within trade. Krugman later developed and popularised work on new trade theory. Krugman's contributions were to be aware that trade increasingly could be explained, not by comparative advantage, but regional concentration and the economies of scale involved. He also explained the importance of consumers' preference for diversity, which explains the survival of higher cost goods, which have a distinctive brand. This field of New Trade theory became one of his areas of expertise, and would form the basis for his Nobel Prize. Krugman is generally supportive of free trade and globalisation. His work on New Trade Theory slowly evolved into New Economic Geography (NEG). His seminal 1991 paper on New Economic Geography (NEG) in the Journal of Political Economy became one of the most cited economic works in this field.
Krugman has worked at various top universities, such as MIT, London School of Economics, and Princeton University. In 1982, he spent a year working for the Council of Economic Advisers under the Presidency of Ronald Reagan.
Krugman rose to public prominence for his columns in the Slate and New York Times, which were highly critical of the Bush administration. He also wrote a book 'The Great Unraveling' which criticised Bush's economic and foreign policy. In particular, Krugman criticised the policy of cutting taxes for the rich, leading to budget deficits during growth. Krugman also believed Bush based his campaign on misinformation and false facts.
            Back  in 2000, George W. Bush made a discovery of enormous consequence: you  could base a whole political campaign on claims that were flatly untrue,  like the claim that your big tax cuts for the wealthy went to the  middle class, or the claim that diverting Social Security funds into  private accounts would strengthen the system’s finances, and reporting  would never point this out. That’s when I formulated my doctrine that if  Bush said the earth was flat, headlines would read Views Differ on  Shape of Planet.  
Krugman was also an outspoken critic of the Iraq war and criticised the response of some politicians to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Krugman became a leading critic of the growing income inequality in America. Blaming the Republican ideology for waging a war on the poor. His book "The Conscience of a Liberal" details the growth in income inequality in the later part of the Twentieth Century in the US.
“I believe in a relatively equal society, supported by institutions that  limit extremes of wealth and poverty. I believe in democracy, civil  liberties, and the rule of law. That makes me a liberal, and I’m proud  of it.” 
Krugman has become more well known for his work on macroeconomics and fiscal policy. He studied the Japanese lost decade and the Asian crisis. His book - 'The Return of Depression Economics' highlighted the liquidity trap that Japan had fallen into.
After the 2008 economic crisis, Krugman was a leading critic of austerity. Krugman argued that leading economies were stuck in a classic liquidity trap. In this situation, Krugman argued governments could print money and run large budget deficits without causing a rise in interest rates or inflation. His model of liquidity trap broadly predicted the low inflation, low growth recovery. Krugman became a household name in part because of his ability to popularise and simplify complex economic problems. Krugman is also quite direct, openly criticising politicians and other economist. For example, is his openly critical of 'Very Serious People' - establishment figures who hold onto views, Krugman believes have been shown to be wrong.
I use the phrase “Very Serious People” a lot; it seems to me to capture  the way respectable opinion keeps demanding utterly foolish policies.
He tends to take strong adversarial positions which create a strong reaction - both negative and positive from across the political spectrum. Martin Wolf,  journalist for the Financial Times, in the UK has written that Krugman is both the "most hated and most admired columnist in the US"
Krugman was instrumental in recreating interest in the work of John M. Keynes. Krugman took a stricter Old Keynesian approach than some of the later 'New Keynesians' who down played role of fiscal policy in managing demand. Krugman argued, that in the lesser depression, governments were failing to provide sufficient demand in the economy, and this was main cause of persistent recession and high unemployment. He wrote a book - "End this depression now!" which became a best-seller. Krugman wrote in the book:
But don’t we have to worry about long-run budget deficits? Keynes wrote  that “the boom, not the slump, is the time for austerity.” Now, as I  argue in my forthcoming book*—and show later in the data discussed in  this article—is the time for the government to spend more until the  private sector is ready to carry the economy forward again
Krugman views himself as a Keynesian economics. He has also promoted the IS-LM model invented by John Hicks. Although identified with elements of new-Keynesianism, he is critical of the complexity and rigidity of some of the New Keynesian models.
Krugman has married twice.  He is currently married to Robin Wells, his second wife, an academic economist. Krugman is a self-confessed Sci-fi geek. He credits Isaac Asimov's Foundation novels for sparking off an interest in economics. He describes himself as a bit of a loner and shy. He told NY Times - "Loner. Ordinarily shy. Shy with individuals," He lives in Princeton, New Jersey.
