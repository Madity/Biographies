Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA (i/ˈstiːvən ˈhɔːkɪŋ/; born 8 January 1942) is an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, author and Director of Research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology within the University of Cambridge.[14][15] Among his significant scientific works have been a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first to set forth a cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He is a vocal supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25]
Hawking is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. Hawking was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009.
Hawking has achieved success with works of popular science in which he discusses his own theories and cosmology in general; his A Brief History of Time stayed on the British Sunday Times best-sellers list for a record-breaking 237 weeks.
Hawking has a motor neuron disease related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a condition that has progressed over the years. He is almost entirely paralysed and communicates through a speech generating device. He married twice and has three children.
Stephen Hawking was born on 8 January 1942[1] to Frank and Isobel Hawking.[26][27] Despite their families' financial constraints, both parents attended the University of Oxford, where Frank studied medicine and Isobel, Philosophy, Politics and Economics.[27] The two met shortly after the beginning of the Second World War at a medical research institute where she was working as a secretary and he as a medical researcher.[27][28] They lived in Highgate, but as London was under attack in those years, his mother went to Oxford to give birth in greater safety.[29] Stephen has two younger sisters, Philippa and Mary, and an adopted brother, Edward.[30] He began his schooling at the Byron House School; he later blamed its "progressive methods" for his failure to learn to read while at the school.[31]
In 1950, when his father became head of the division of parasitology at the National Institute for Medical Research, Hawking and his family moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire.[31][32] The eight-year-old Hawking attended St Albans High School for Girls for a few months; at that time, younger boys could attend one of the houses.[33][34] In St Albans, the family were considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric;[31][35] meals were often spent with each person silently reading a book.[31] They lived a frugal existence in a large, cluttered, and poorly maintained house, and travelled in a converted London taxicab.[36][37] During one of Hawking's father's frequent absences working in Africa,[38] the rest of the family spent four months in Majorca visiting his mother's friend Beryl and her husband, the poet Robert Graves.[33]
On their return to England, Hawking attended Radlett School for a year[34] and from September 1952, St Albans School.[39] The family placed a high value on education.[31] Hawking's father wanted his son to attend the well-regarded Westminster School, but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill on the day of the scholarship examination. His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans.[40][41] A positive consequence was that Hawking remained with a close group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats,[42] and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception.[43] From 1958, and with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components.[44][45] Although at school he was known as "Einstein," Hawking was not initially successful academically.[46] With time, he began to show considerable aptitude for scientific subjects, and inspired by Tahta, decided to study mathematics at university.[47][48][49] Hawking's father advised him to study medicine, concerned that there were few jobs for mathematics graduates.[50] He wanted Hawking to attend University College, Oxford, his own alma mater. As it was not possible to read mathematics there at the time, Hawking decided to study physics and chemistry. Despite his headmaster's advice to wait until the next year, Hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations in March 1959.[51][52]
Hawking began his university education at the University of Oxford in October 1959 at the age of 17.[53] For the first 18 months, he was bored and lonely: he was younger than many other students, and found the academic work "ridiculously easy."[54][55] His physics tutor Robert Berman later said, "It was only necessary for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it."[56] A change occurred during his second and third year when, according to Berman, Hawking made more effort "to be one of the boys". He developed into a popular, lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science fiction.[53] Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college Boat Club, where he coxed a rowing team.[57][58] The rowing trainer at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats.[59][57] Hawking has estimated that he studied about 1,000 hours during his three years at Oxford. These unimpressive study habits made sitting his Finals a challenge, and he decided to answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge. A first-class honours degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge.[60][61] Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations and the final result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a viva necessary.[61][62] Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student, so when asked at the oral examination to describe his future plans, he said, "If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First."[61][63] He was held in higher regard than he believed: as Berman commented, the examiners "were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves."[61] After receiving a first-class BA (Hons.) degree, and following a trip to Iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in October 1962.[64][65]
Hawking's first year as a doctoral student[12] was difficult. He was initially disappointed to find that he had been assigned Dennis William Sciama as a supervisor rather than Fred Hoyle,[66][67] and he found his training in mathematics inadequate for work in general relativity and cosmology.[68] He also struggled with his health. Hawking had experienced increasing clumsiness during his final year at Oxford, including a fall on some stairs and difficulties when rowing.[69][70] The problems worsened, and his speech became slightly slurred; his family noticed the changes when he returned home for Christmas and medical investigations were begun.[71][72] The diagnosis of motor neurone disease came when Hawking was 21. At the time, doctors gave him a life expectancy of two years.[73][74] After his diagnosis, Hawking fell into a depression; though his doctors advised that he continue with his studies, he felt there was little point.[75] At the same time, however, his relationship with Jane Wilde, friend of his sister, and whom he had met shortly before his diagnosis, continued to develop. The couple were engaged in October 1964.[76][77] Hawking later said that the engagement "gave him something to live for."[78] Despite the disease's progression—Hawking had difficulty walking without support, and his speech was almost unintelligible—he now returned to his work with enthusiasm.[79] Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of Fred Hoyle and his student Jayant Narlikar at a lecture in June 1964.[80][81]
When Hawking began his graduate studies, there was much debate in the physics community about the prevailing theories of the creation of the universe: the Big Bang and the Steady State theories.[82] Inspired by Roger Penrose's theorem of a spacetime singularity in the centre of black holes, Hawking applied the same thinking to the entire universe, and during 1965 wrote up his thesis on this topic.[83] There were other positive developments: Hawking received a research fellowship at Gonville and Caius College, and he and Jane were married on 14 July 1965.[84] He obtained his D.Phil. degree in March 1966,[85] and his essay entitled "Singularities and the Geometry of Space-Time" shared top honours with one by Penrose to win that year's Adams Prize.[86][85]
The first years of marriage were hectic: Jane lived in London during the week as she completed her degree and they travelled to the United States several times for conferences and physics-related visits. The couple had difficulty finding housing that was within Hawking's walking distance to the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP). Jane began a Ph.D. program, and a son, Robert, was born in May 1967.[87][88] In his work, and in collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the singularity theorem concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis. This included not only the existence of singularities but also the theory that the universe might have started as a singularity. Their joint essay was the runner-up in the 1968 Gravity Research Foundation competition.[89][90] In 1970 they published a proof that if the universe obeys the general theory of relativity and fits any of the models of physical cosmology developed by Alexander Friedmann, then it must have begun as a singularity.[91][92][93]
During the late 1960s, Hawking's physical abilities declined once more: he began to use crutches and ceased lecturing regularly.[94] As he slowly lost the ability to write, he developed compensatory visual methods, including seeing equations in terms of geometry.[95][96] The physicist Werner Israel later compared the achievements to Mozart composing an entire symphony in his head.[97][98] Hawking was, however, fiercely independent and unwilling to accept help or make concessions for his disabilities. He preferred to be regarded as "a scientist first, popular science writer second, and, in all the ways that matter, a normal human being with the same desires, drives, dreams, and ambitions as the next person."[99] Jane Hawking later noted that "Some people would call it determination, some obstinacy. I've called it both at one time or another."[100] He required much persuasion to accept the use of a wheelchair at the end of the 1960s,[101] but ultimately became notorious for the wildness of his wheelchair driving.[100] Hawking was a popular and witty colleague, but his illness as well as his reputation for brashness and intelligence distanced him from some.[102] In 1969, Hawking accepted a specially created 'Fellowship for Distinction in Science' to remain at Caius.[103]
A daughter, Lucy, was born in 1970.[104] Soon after Hawking discovered what became known as the second law of black hole dynamics, that the event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller.[105] With James M. Bardeen and Brandon Carter, he proposed the four laws of black hole mechanics, drawing an analogy with thermodynamics.[106] To Hawking's irritation, Jacob Bekenstein, a graduate student of John Wheeler, went further—and ultimately correctly—applying thermodynamic concepts literally.[107][108] In the early 1970s, Hawking's work with Carter, Werner Israel and David C. Robinson strongly supported Wheeler's no-hair theorem that no matter what the original material from which a black hole is created it can be completely described by the properties of mass, electrical charge and rotation.[109][110] His essay titled "Black Holes" won the Gravity Research Foundation Award in January 1971.[111] Hawking's first book The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time written with George Ellis was published in 1973.[112]
Beginning in 1973, Hawking moved into the study of quantum gravity and quantum mechanics.[113][112] His work in this area was spurred by a visit to Moscow and discussions with Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich and Alexei Starobinsky, whose work showed that according to the uncertainty principle rotating black holes emit particles.[114] To Hawking's annoyance, his much-checked calculations produced findings that contradicted his second law, which claimed black holes could never get smaller,[115] and supported Bekenstein's reasoning about their entropy.[116][114] His results, which Hawking presented from 1974, showed that black holes emit radiation, known today as Hawking radiation, which may continue until they exhaust their energy and evaporate.[117][118][119] Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. However by the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics.[120][121][122] In March 1974, a few weeks after the announcement of Hawking radiation, Hawking was invested as a Fellow of the Royal Society, one of the youngest scientists to be so honoured.[123][124]
Hawking rarely discussed his illness and physical challenges, even—in a precedent set during their courtship—with Jane.[125] Hawking's disabilities meant that the responsibilities of home and family rested firmly on his wife's increasingly overwhelmed shoulders, leaving him more time to think about physics.[126] When in 1974 Hawking was appointed to the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Scholar visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Jane proposed that a graduate or post-doctoral student live with them and help with his care. Hawking accepted, and Bernard Carr travelled to California with them as the first of many students who fulfilled this role.[127][128] The family spent a generally happy and stimulating year in Pasadena.[129] Hawking worked with his friend on the faculty, Kip Thorne,[130] and engaged him in a scientific wager about whether the dark star Cygnus X-1 was a black hole. The wager was a surprising "insurance policy" against the proposition that black holes did not exist.[131] Hawking acknowledged that he had lost the bet in 1990, which was the first of several that he was to make with Thorne and others.[132] Hawking has maintained ties to Caltech, spending a month there almost every year since this first visit.[133]
Hawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a new home, a new job—as Reader. Don Page, with whom Hawking had begun a close friendship at Caltech, arrived to work as the live-in graduate student assistant. With Page's help and that of a secretary, Jane's responsibilities were reduced so she could return to her thesis and her new interest in singing.[134] The mid to late 1970s were a period of growing public interest in black holes and of the physicist who was studying them. Hawking was regularly interviewed for print and television.[135][136] He also received increasing academic recognition of his work.[137] In 1975 he was awarded both the Eddington Medal and the Pius XI Gold Medal, and in 1976 the Dannie Heineman Prize, the Maxwell Prize and the Hughes Medal.[138][139] Hawking was appointed a professor with a chair in gravitational physics in 1977.[140] The following year he received the Albert Einstein Medal and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.[77][137]
Hawking's speech deteriorated, and by the late 1970s he could only be understood by his family and closest friends. To communicate with others, someone who knew him well would translate his speech into intelligible speech.[141] Spurred by a dispute with the university over who would pay for the ramp needed for him to enter his workplace, Hawking and his wife campaigned for improved access and support for those with disabilities in Cambridge,[142][143] including adapted student housing at the university.[144] In general, however, Hawking had ambivalent feelings about his role as a disability rights champion: while wanting to help others, he sought to detach himself from his illness and its challenges.[145] His lack of engagement led to some criticism.[146] The Hawking family welcomed a third child, Timothy, in April 1979.[137] That autumn Hawking was appointed the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.[137][147]
Hawking's inaugural lecture as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics was titled: "Is the end in sight for Theoretical Physics" and proposed N=8 Supergravity as the leading theory to solve many of the outstanding problems physicists were studying.[148] Hawking's promotion coincided with a health crisis which led to Hawking accepting, albeit reluctantly, some nursing services at home.[149] At the same time he was also making a transition in his approach to physics, becoming more intuitive and speculative rather than insisting on mathematical proofs. "I would rather be right than rigorous" he told Kip Thorne.[150] In 1981 he proposed that information in a black hole is irretrievably lost when a black hole evaporates. This information paradox violates the fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics, and was to lead to years of debate, including "the Black Hole War" with Leonard Susskind and Gerard 't Hooft.[151][152]
In December 1977, Jane had met organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones when singing in a church choir. Hellyer Jones became close to the Hawking family, and by the mid-1980s, he and Jane had developed romantic feelings for each other.[140][153][154] According to Jane, her husband was accepting of the situation, stating "he would not object so long as I continued to love him."[140][155][156] Jane and Hellyer Jones determined not to break up the family and their relationship remained platonic for a long period.[157]
Cosmological inflation—a theory proposing that following the Big Bang the universe initially expanded incredibly rapidly before settling down to a slower expansion—was proposed by Alan Guth and also developed by Andrei Linde.[158] Following a conference in Moscow in October 1981, Hawking and Gary Gibbons organized a three-week Nuffield Workshop in the summer of 1982 on the Very Early Universe at Cambridge University, which focused mainly on inflation theory.[159][160][161] Hawking also began a new line of quantum theory research into the origin of the universe. In 1981 at a Vatican conference he presented work suggesting that there might be no boundary—or beginning or ending—to the universe.[162][163] He subsequently developed the research in collaboration with Jim Hartle, and in 1983 they published a model, known as the Hartle–Hawking state. It proposed that prior to the Planck epoch, the universe had no boundary in space-time; before the Big Bang, time did not exist and the concept of the beginning of the universe is meaningless.[164] The initial singularity of the classical Big Bang models was replaced with a region akin to the North Pole. One cannot travel north of the North Pole, but there is no boundary there—it is simply the point where all north-running lines meet and end.[165][166] Initially the no-boundary proposal predicted a closed universe which had implications about the existence of God. As Hawking explained "If the universe has no boundaries but is self-contained... then God would not have had any freedom to choose how the universe began."[167]
Hawking did not rule out the existence of a Creator, asking in A Brief History of Time "Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence?"[168] In his early work, Hawking spoke of God in a metaphorical sense. In A Brief History of Time he wrote: "If we discover a complete theory, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason—for then we should know the mind of God."[169] In the same book he suggested the existence of God was unnecessary to explain the origin of the universe. Later discussions with Neil Turok led to the realisation that it is also compatible with an open universe.[170]
Further work by Hawking in the area of arrows of time led to the 1985 publication of a paper theorising that if the no-boundary proposition were correct, then when the universe stopped expanding and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards.[171] A paper by Don Page and Raymond Laflamme led Hawking to withdraw this concept.[172] Honours continued to be awarded: in 1981 he was awarded the American Franklin Medal,[173] and in 1982 made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).[174][175] Awards do not pay the bills, however, and motivated by the need to finance the children's education and home expenses, in 1982 Hawking determined to write a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public.[176][177] Instead of publishing with an academic press, he signed a contract with Bantam Books, a mass market publisher, and received a large advance for his book.[178][179] A first draft of the book, called A Brief History of Time, was completed in 1984.[180]
During a visit to CERN in Geneva in the summer of 1985, Hawking contracted pneumonia which in his condition was life-threatening; he was so ill that Jane was asked if life support should be terminated. She refused but the consequence was a tracheotomy, which would require round-the-clock nursing care, and remove what remained of his speech.[181][182] The National Health Service would pay for a nursing home but Jane was determined that he would live at home. The cost of the care was funded by an American foundation.[183][184] Nurses were hired for the three shifts required to provide the round-the-clock support he required. One of those employed was Elaine Mason, who was to become Hawking's second wife.[185] For his communication, Hawking initially raised his eyebrows to choose letters on a spelling card.[186] But he then received a computer program called the "Equalizer" from Walt Woltosz. In a method he uses to this day, using a switch he selects phrases, words or letters from a bank of about 2500–3000 that are scanned.[187][188] The program was originally run on a desktop computer. However, Elaine Mason's husband David, a computer engineer, adapted a small computer and attached it to his wheelchair.[189] Released from the need to use somebody to interpret his speech, Hawking commented that "I can communicate better now than before I lost my voice."[190] The voice he uses has an American accent and is no longer produced.[191][192] Despite the availability of other voices, Hawking has retained his original voice, saying that he prefers his current voice and identifies with it.[193] At this point, Hawking activated a switch using his hand and could produce up to 15 words a minute.[194] Lectures were prepared in advance, and sent to the speech synthesiser in short sections as they were delivered.[191]
One of the first messages Hawking produced with his speech generating device was a request for his assistant to help him finish writing A Brief History of Time.[194] Peter Guzzardi, his editor at Bantam, pushed him to explain his ideas clearly in non-technical language, a process that required multiple revisions from an increasingly irritated Hawking.[195] The book was published in April 1988 in the US and in June in the UK, and proved to be an extraordinary success, rising quickly to the top of bestseller lists in both countries and remaining there for weeks and months.[196][197][198] The book was translated into multiple languages,[199] and ultimately sold an estimated 9 million copies.[198] Media attention was intense,[199] and Newsweek magazine cover and a television special both described him as "Master of the Universe". Success led to significant financial rewards, but also the challenges of celebrity status.[200] Hawking travelled extensively to promote his work, and enjoyed partying and dancing[citation needed] into the small hours.[199] He had difficulty refusing the invitations and visitors which left limited time for work and his students.[201] Some colleagues were resentful of the attention Hawking received, feeling it was due to his disability.[202][203] He received further academic recognition, including five further honorary degrees,[204] the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1985),[205] the Paul Dirac Medal (1987)[204] and, jointly with Penrose, the prestigious Wolf Prize (1988).[206] In 1989, he was named a Companion of Honour by Queen Elizabeth II.[201] He reportedly declined a knighthood. [207]
Hawking's marriage had been strained for many years. Jane felt overwhelmed by the intrusion into their family life of the required nurses and assistants. The impact of his celebrity was challenging for colleagues and family members, and in one interview Jane described her role as "simply to tell him that he's not God."[208][209] Hawking's agnostic views of religion also contrasted with her strong Christian faith, and resulted in tension.[210][209][211] In the late 1980s Hawking had grown close to one of his nurses, Elaine Mason, to the dismay of some colleagues, caregivers and family members who were disturbed by her strength of personality and protectiveness.[212] Hawking told Jane that he was leaving her for Mason,[213] and departed the family home in February 1990.[174] Following his divorce from Jane in the spring of 1995, Hawking married Mason in September,[214][174] declaring "It's wonderful—I have married the woman I love."[215]
Hawking pursued his work in physics: in 1993 he co-edited a book on Euclidean quantum gravity with Gary Gibbons, and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the Big Bang.[216] In 1994 at Cambridge's Newton Institute, Hawking and Penrose delivered a series of six lectures, which were published in 1996 as "The Nature of Space and Time".[217] In 1997 he conceded a 1991 public scientific wager made with Kip Thorne and John Preskill of Caltech. Hawking had bet that Penrose's proposal of a "cosmic censorship conjecture"—that there could be no "naked singularities" unclothed within a horizon—was correct.[218] After discovering his concession might have been premature, a new, more refined, wager was made. This specified that such singularities would occur without extra conditions.[219] The same year, Thorne, Hawking and Preskill made another bet, this time concerning the black hole information paradox.[220][221] Thorne and Hawking argued that since general relativity made it impossible for black holes to radiate and lose information, the mass-energy and information carried by Hawking Radiation must be "new", and not from inside the black hole event horizon. Since this contradicted the quantum mechanics of microcausality, quantum mechanics theory would need to be rewritten. Preskill argued the opposite, that since quantum mechanics suggests that the information emitted by a black hole relates to information that fell in at an earlier time, the concept of black holes given by general relativity must be modified in some way.[222]
Hawking also maintained his public profile, including bringing science to a wider audience. In 1992 a film version of "A Brief History of Time"—directed by Errol Morris and produced by Steven Spielberg—was premiered. Hawking had wanted the film to be scientific rather than biographical, but was persuaded otherwise. The film, while a critical success, was however not widely released.[223] A popular-level collection of essays, interviews and talk titled Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays was published in 1993[224] and six-part television series Stephen Hawking's Universe and companion book appeared in 1997. As Hawking insisted, this time the focus was entirely on science.[225][226] He also made several appearances in popular media. At the release party for the home video version of the "A Brief History of Time", Leonard Nimoy, who had played Spock on Star Trek, learned that Hawking was interested in appearing on the show. Nimoy made the necessary contact and Hawking appeared as himself on Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1993.[227][228][229] The same year, his synthesiser voice was recorded for the Pink Floyd song "Keep Talking",[230][224] and in 1999 for an appearance on The Simpsons.[231]
In the 1990s, Hawking accepted more openly the mantle of role model for disabled people, including lecturing on the subject and participating in fundraising activities.[232] At the turn of the century, he and eleven other luminaries signed the "Charter for the Third Millennium on Disability" which called on governments to prevent disability and protect disabled rights.[233][234] In 1999 Hawking was awarded the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize of the American Physical Society.[235] The same year, Jane Hawking published a memoir, Music to Move the Stars, describing her marriage to Hawking and its breakdown. Its revelations caused a sensation in the media, but as was his usual practice regarding his personal life, Hawking made no public comment except to say that he did not read biographies about himself.[236]

Following his second marriage, Hawking's family felt excluded and marginalised from his life.[211][237] For a period of about five years in the early 2000s, his family and staff became increasingly worried that he was being physically abused.[237][238] Police investigations took place, but were closed as Hawking refused to make a complaint.[237][239][240]
Hawking continued his writings for a popular audience, publishing The Universe in a Nutshell in 2001, [241] and A Briefer History of Time which he wrote in 2005 with Leonard Mlodinow to update his earlier works to make them accessible to a wider audience, and God Created the Integers, which appeared in 2006.[242] Along with Thomas Hertog at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and Jim Hartle, from 2006 on Hawking developed a theory of "top-down cosmology", which says that the universe had not one unique initial state but many different ones, and therefore that it is inappropriate to formulate a theory that predicts the universe's current configuration from one particular initial state.[243] Top-down cosmology posits that the present "selects" the past from a superposition of many possible histories. In doing so, the theory suggests a possible resolution of the fine-tuning question.[244][245]
In 2006 Hawking and Elaine quietly divorced,[246][247] following which Hawking resumed closer relationships with Jane, his children and grandchildren.[247][209] Reflecting this happier period, a revised version of Jane's book called Travelling to Infinity, My Life with Stephen appeared in 2007.[237] That year Hawking and his daughter Lucy published George's Secret Key to the Universe, a children's book designed to explain theoretical physics in an accessible fashion and featuring characters similar to those in the Hawking family.[248] The book was followed by sequels in 2009 and 2011.[249]
Hawking continued to feature regularly on the screen: documentaries entitled :The Real Stephen Hawking: (2001)[250] and Stephen Hawking: Profile (2002), [251] a TV film Hawking about the period around the onset of Hawking's illness (2004),[251] and a documentary series Stephen Hawking, Master of the Universe (2008).[252] Hawking made further appearances in animated form on The Simpsons,[253][254] and Futurama[245] in which he does his own voice acting,[255] and in person on The Big Bang Theory.[256] Hawking continued to travel widely, including trips to Chile, Easter Island, South Africa and Spain (to receive the Fonseca Prize in 2008) [257][258] Canada[259] and multiple trips to the United States.[260] For practical reasons related to his disability Hawking increasingly travelled by private jet, and by 2011 that had become his only mode of international travel.[261]
Over the years, Hawking maintained his public profile with a series of attention-getting and often controversial statements:[262] he has asserted that computer viruses were a form of life,[263] that humans should use genetic engineering to avoid being outsmarted by computers,[264] and that aliens likely exist and contact with them should be avoided.[265][266] Hawking has expressed his concerns that life on earth is at risk due to "a sudden nuclear war, a genetically engineered virus or other dangers we have not yet thought of".[267] He views spaceflight and the colonisation of space as necessary for the future of humanity.[267][268] Motivated by the desire to increase public interest in spaceflight and to show the potential of people with disabilities, in 2007 he participated in zero-gravity flight in a "Vomit Comet", courtesy of Zero Gravity Corporation, during which he experienced weightlessness eight times.[267][269][270][271]
A longstanding Labour Party supporter, Hawking has also increasingly made his views known on a variety of political subjects.[272][273] He recorded a tribute for the 2000 Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore,[274] called the 2003 invasion of Iraq a "war crime",[273][275] boycotted a conference in Israel due to concerns about Israel's policies towards Palestinians,[276][277][278] maintained his longstanding campaigning for nuclear disarmament,[272][279][273] and has supported stem cell research,[273][280] universal health care,[281] and action to prevent climate change.[279] Hawking has also used his fame to advertise products, including a wheelchair,[234] National Savings,[282] British Telecom, Specsavers and Egg Banking,[283] and Go Compare.[284]
In the area of physics, by 2003, consensus was growing that Hawking was wrong about the loss of information in a black hole.[285] In a 2004 lecture in Dublin, the physicist conceded his 1997 bet with Preskill, but described his own, somewhat controversial solution, to the information paradox problem, involving the possibility that black holes have more than one topology.[286][222] In the 2005 paper he published on the subject, he argued that the information paradox was explained by examining all the alternative histories of universes, with the information loss in those with black holes being cancelled out by those without.[221][287] In January 2014 he called this his "biggest blunder." [288]
As part of another longstanding scientific dispute, Hawking had emphatically argued, and bet, that the Higgs Boson would never be found.[289] The particle, proposed to exist as part of the Higgs Field theory by Peter Higgs in 1964, became discoverable with the advent of the Fermilab near Chicago and the Large Electron Positron and the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.[290] Hawking and Higgs engaged in a heated and public debate over the matter in 2002 and again in 2008, with Higgs criticising Hawking's work and complaining that Hawking's "celebrity status gives him instant credibility that others do not have."[290] The particle was discovered at CERN in July 2012: Hawking quickly conceded that he had lost his bet[291][292] and said that Higgs should win the Nobel Prize for Physics.[293]
In 2007 he posed this open question on the Internet: “In a world that is in chaos politically, socially and environmentally, how can the human race sustain another 100 years?” A month later he confessed: “I don’t know the answer. That is why I asked the question, to get people to think about it, and to be aware of the dangers we now face.” The Guardian, Britain.
Hawking's disease-related deterioration has continued, and in 2005 he began to control his communication device with movements of his cheek muscles,[294][295][296] with a rate of about one word per minute.[295] With this decline there is a risk of him acquiring locked-in syndrome, so Hawking is collaborating with researchers on systems that could translate Hawking's brain patterns or facial expressions into switch activations.[245][296][297] By 2009 he could no longer drive his wheelchair independently.[298] He has increased breathing difficulties, requiring a ventilator at times, and has been hospitalized several times.[245] In 2002, following a UK-wide vote, the BBC included him in their list of the 100 Greatest Britons. Hawking was awarded the Copley Medal from the Royal Society (2006),[299] America's highest civilian honour, the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2009),[300][301] and the Russian Fundamental Physics Prize (2012).[302]

Several buildings have been named after him, including the Stephen W. Hawking Science Museum in San Salvador, El Salvador,[303] the Stephen Hawking Building in Cambridge,[304] and the Stephen Hawking Centre at Perimeter Institute in Canada.[305] Appropriately, given Hawking's association with time, he unveiled the mechanical "Chronophage" (or time-eating) Corpus Clock at Corpus Christi College Cambridge in September 2008.[306][307]
As required by university regulations, Hawking retired as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 2009. Despite suggestions that he might leave the United Kingdom as a protest against public funding cuts to basic scientific research,[308] Hawking has continued to work as director of research at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, and has indicated no plans to retire.[309]
Hawking has stated that he is "not religious in the normal sense" and he believes that "the universe is governed by the laws of science. The laws may have been decreed by God, but God does not intervene to break the laws."[310] In an interview published in The Guardian, Hawking regarded the concept of Heaven as a myth, believing that there is "no heaven or afterlife" and that such a notion was a "fairy story for people afraid of the dark."[169]
In 2011, when narrating the first episode of the American television series Curiosity on the Discovery Channel, Hawking declared:
We are each free to believe what we want and it is my view that the simplest explanation is there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realization. There is probably no heaven, and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that, I am extremely grateful.[311][312]
At Google's Zeitgeist Conference in 2011, Hawking said that "philosophy is dead." He believes that philosophers "have not kept up with modern developments in science" and that scientists "have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge." He said that philosophical problems can be answered by science, particularly new scientific theories which "lead us to a new and very different picture of the universe and our place in it".[313] In August 2012 Hawking narrated the "Enlightenment" segment of the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony.[314] In 2013, the biographical documentary film Hawking, in which Hawking himself is featured, was released.[315][316][317] In September 2013, he expressed support for the legalization of assisted suicide for the terminally ill.[318]
We are all different – but we share the same human spirit. Perhaps it's human nature that we adapt – and survive.
Hawking has received numerous awards and honours. In 1974 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). His nomination reads
Hawking has made major contributions to the field of general relativity. These derive from a deep understanding of what is relevant to physics and astronomy, and especially from a mastery of wholly new mathematical techniques. Following the pioneering work of Penrose he established, partly alone and partly in collaboration with Penrose, a series of successively stronger theorems establishing the fundamental result that all realistic cosmological models must possess singularities. Using similar techniques, Hawking has proved the basic theorems on the laws governing black holes: that stationary solutions of Einstein's equations with smooth event horizons must necessarily be axisymmetric; and that in the evolution and interaction of black holes, the total surface area of the event horizons must increase. In collaboration with G. Ellis, Hawking is the author of an impressive and original treatise on "Space-time in the Large".
Other important work by Hawking relates to the interpretation of cosmological observations and to the design of gravitational wave detectors.[13]
During his career Hawking has supervised 39 successful PhD students.[2][3][4][5][320][321][322][323][6][324][325][326][7][327][328][329][8][330][9][331][332][333][334][335][336][10][11][337][338][339][340][341][342][343][344][345][346][347][348][349]

Stephen William Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 (300 years after the death of Galileo) in Oxford, England. His parents' house was in north London, but during the second world war, Oxford was considered a safer place to have babies. When he was eight, his family moved to St. Albans, a town about 20 miles north of London. At the age of eleven, Stephen went to St. Albans School and then on to University College, Oxford; his father's old college. Stephen wanted to study Mathematics, although his father would have preferred medicine. Mathematics was not available at University College, so he pursued Physics instead. After three years and not very much work, he was awarded a first  class honours degree in Natural Science.  Stephen then went on to Cambridge to do research in Cosmology, there being no one working in that area in Oxford at the time. His supervisor was Denis Sciama, although he had hoped to get Fred Hoyle who was working in Cambridge. After gaining his Ph.D. he became first a Research Fellow and later on a Professorial Fellow at Gonville and Caius College. After leaving the Institute of Astronomy in 1973, Stephen came to the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics in 1979, and held the post of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics from 1979 until 2009. The chair was founded in 1663 with money left in the will of the Reverend Henry Lucas who had been the Member of Parliament for the University. It was first held by Isaac Barrow and then in 1669 by Isaac Newton.  Stephen is still an active part of Cambridge University and retains an office at the Department for Applied Maths and Theoretical Physics. His title is now Director of Research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology. Stephen Hawking has worked on the basic laws which govern the universe. With Roger Penrose he showed that Einstein's General Theory of Relativity implied space and time would have a beginning in the Big Bang and an end in black holes. These results indicated that it was necessary to unify General Relativity with Quantum Theory, the other great Scientific development of the first half of the 20th Century. One consequence of such a unification that he discovered was that black holes should not be completely black, but rather should emit radiation and eventually evaporate and disappear. Another conjecture is that the universe has no edge or boundary in imaginary time. This would imply that the way the universe began was completely determined by the laws of science.His many publications include The Large Scale Structure of Spacetime with G F R Ellis, General Relativity: An Einstein Centenary Survey, with W Israel, and 300 Years of Gravity, with W Israel. Stephen Hawking has three popular books published; his best seller A Brief History of Time, Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays, The Universe in a Nutshell, and most recently in  2010, The Grand Design.  Professor Hawking has twelve honorary degrees. He was awarded the CBE in 1982, and was made a Companion of Honour in 1989. He is the recipient of many awards, medals and prizes, is a Fellow of The Royal Society and a Member of the US National Academy of Sciences.  Stephen was diagnosed with ALS, a form of Motor Neurone Disease, shortly after his 21st birthday. In spite of being wheelchair bound and dependent on a computerised voice system for communication Stephen Hawking continues to combine family life (he has three children and three grandchildren), and his research into theoretical physics together with an extensive programme of travel and public lectures. He still hopes to make it into space one day.
=======================================================
Stephen Hawking's parents lived in London where his father was undertaking research into medicine. However, London was a dangerous place during World War II and Stephen's mother was sent to the safer town of Oxford where Stephen was born. The family were soon back together living in Highgate, north London, where Stephen began his schooling.
In 1950 Stephen's father moved to the Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill. The family moved to St Albans so that the journey to Mill Hill was easier. Stephen attended St Albans High School for Girls (which took boys up to the age of 10). When he was older he attended St Albans school but his father wanted him to take the scholarship examination to go to Westminster public school. However Stephen was ill at the time of the examinations and remained at St Albans school which he had attended from the age of 11. Stephen writes in [2]:-
I got an education there that was as good as, if not better than, that I would have had at Westminster. I have never found that my lack of social graces has been a hindrance.
Hawking wanted to specialise in mathematics in his last couple of years at school where his mathematics teacher had inspired him to study the subject. However Hawking's father was strongly against the idea and Hawking was persuaded to make chemistry his main school subject. Part of his father's reasoning was that he wanted Hawking to go to University College, Oxford, the College he himself had attended, and that College had no mathematics fellow.
In March 1959 Hawking took the scholarship examinations with the aim of studying natural sciences at Oxford. He was awarded an exhibition, despite feeling that he had performed badly, and at University College he specialised in physics in his natural sciences degree. He only just made a First Class degree in 1962 and in [1] he explains how the attitude of the time worked against him:-
The prevailing attitude at Oxford at that time was very anti-work. You were supposed to be brilliant without effort, or accept your limitations and get a fourth-class degree. To work hard to get a better class of degree was regarded as the mark of a grey man - the worst epithet in the Oxford vocabulary.
From Oxford, Hawking moved to Cambridge to take up research in general relativity and cosmology, a difficult area for someone with only a little mathematical background. Hawking had noticed that he was becoming rather clumsy during his last year at Oxford and, when he returned home for Christmas 1962 at the end of his first term at Cambridge, his mother persuaded him to see a doctor. 
In early 1963 he spent two weeks having tests in hospital and motor neurone disease (Lou Gehrig's disease) was diagnosed. His condition deteriorated quickly and the doctors predicted that he would not live long enough to complete his doctorate. However Hawking writes:-
... although there was a cloud hanging over my future, I found to my surprise that I was enjoying life in the present more than I had before. I began to make progress with my research...
The reason that his research progressed was that he met a girl he wanted to marry and realised he had to complete his doctorate to get a job so:-
After completing his doctorate in 1966 Hawking was awarded a fellowship at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. At first his position was that of Research Fellow, but later he became a Professorial Fellow at Gonville and Caius College. In 1973 he left the Institute of Astronomy and joined to the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at Cambridge. He became Professor of Gravitational Physics at Cambridge in 1977. In 1979 Hawking was appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge. The man born 300 years to the day after Galileo died now held Newton's chair at Cambridge.
Between 1965 and 1970 Hawking worked on singularities in the theory of general relativity devising new mathematical techniques to study this area of cosmology. Much of his work in this area was done in collaboration with Roger Penrose who, at that time, was at Birkbeck College, London. From 1970 Hawking began to apply his previous ideas to the study of black holes.
Continuing this work on black holes, Hawking discovered in 1970 a remarkable property. Using quantum theory and general relativity he was able to show that black holes can emit radiation. His success with proving this made him work from that time on combining the theory of general relativity with quantum theory. In 1971 Hawking investigated the creation of the Universe and predicted that, following the big bang, many objects as heavy as 109 tons but only the size of a proton would be created. These mini black holes have large gravitational attraction governed by general relativity, while the laws of quantum mechanics would apply to objects that small.
Another remarkable achievement of Hawking's using these techniques was his "no boundary proposal" made in 1983 with Jim Hartle of Santa Barbara. Hawking explains that this would mean:-
... that both time and space are finite in extent, but they don't have any boundary or edge. ... there would be no singularities, and the laws of science would hold everywhere, including at the beginning of the universe.
In 1982 Hawking decided to write a popular book on cosmology. By 1984 he had produced a first draft of A Brief History of Time. However Hawking was to suffer a further illness:-
I was in Geneva, at CERN, the big particle accelerator, in the summer of 1985. ... I caught pneumonia and was rushed to hospital. The hospital in Geneva suggested to my wife that it was not worth keeping the life support machine on. But she was having none of that. I was flown back to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, where a surgeon called Roger Grey carried out a tracheotomy. That operation saved my life but took away my voice.
Hawking was given a computer system to enable him to have an electronic voice. It was with these difficulties that he revised the draft of A Brief History of Time which was published in 1988. The book broke sales records in a way that it would have been hard to predict. By May 1995 it had been in The Sunday Times best-sellers list for 237 weeks breaking the previous record of 184 weeks. This feat is recorded in the 1998 Guinness Book of Records. Also recorded there is the fact that the paperback edition was published on 6 April 1995 and reached number one in the best sellers in 3 days. By April 1993 there had been 40 hardback editions of A Brief History of Time in the United States and 39 hardback editions in the UK.
In 2002 Hawking published On the shoulders of giants. The great works of physics and astronomy. This book, which he edited, contains reprints of nearly complete editions of: Copernicus, On the revolution of the heavenly spheres (1543); Galileo, Dialogues concerning two new sciences (1638); Kepler, Harmony of the world (Book Five) (1618); Newton, Principia (1687); and seven papers on relativity by Einstein. Each work is prefaced with a commentary by Hawking. Also from 7 to 10 January 2002 a workshop and symposium was held in Cambridge to celebrate Hawking's 60th birthday. The Proceeding was published in 2003 and James T Liu writes in a review:-
While many prominent physicists, cosmologists and astronomers have made important contributions to the study of quantum gravity and cosmology, the impact of Stephen Hawking's contributions to the field truly stand out. Although his work on black hole thermodynamics is perhaps the most well known, Hawking has also made major contributions to the study of singularity theorems in general relativity, black hole uniqueness, quantum fields in curved spacetimes, Euclidean quantum gravity, the wave function of the universe and many other areas as well. In addition to his own work, Hawking has served as advisor and mentor to a remarkable set of students. Furthermore, it would be hard to imagine assembling any list of researchers working in quantum cosmology without including a large number of Hawking's students and close colleagues. Thus the group that gathered at the CMS in Cambridge in honour of his 60th birthday includes some of the leading theorists in the field.
In 2005 Hawking published Information loss in black holes in which he proposed a solution to the information loss paradox. In the same year Black holes and the information paradox was published, being the transcript of the famous talk Hawking gave at the 17th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation in Dublin in 2004. In 2007 he published God created the integers. The mathematical breakthroughs that changed history. This is another anthology edited by Hawking containing selections from the writings of twenty-one mathematicians. For each mathematician he gives a brief biography and puts the selection into its mathematical context.
Of course Hawking has received, and continues to receive, a large number of honours for his remarkable achievements. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1974, being one of its youngest fellows. In 1975 he was awarded the Eddington Medal, in 1976 received the Hughes Medal from the Royal Society, in 1979 he was awarded the Albert Einstein Medal, in 1982 be was made a Commander of the British Empire by the Queen, in 1985 he received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, and in 1986 he was elected a Member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. He continued to receive major honours such as the prestigious Wolf Prize in Physics in 1988. In the following year he received the Prince of Asturias Awards in Concord and also was made a Companion of Honour. In 1999 he received the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize of the American Physical Society:-
... for boldness and creativity in gravitational physics, best illustrated by the prediction that black holes should emit black body radiation and evaporate, and for the special gift of making abstract ideas accessible and exciting to experts, generalists, and the public alike.
In 2003 Hawking was awarded the Michelson Morley Award of Case Western Reserve University and in 2006 the Copley Medal of the Royal Society. This last award, announced on 24 August 2006, was presented to Hawking on the 30 November 2006 at the Society's annual Anniversary Day, commemorating the foundation of the Society in 1660. This was the 275th anniversary of the Copley Medal and the award to Hawking was marked in a unique way. The medal he received had been carried by the British astronaut Piers Sellers on a Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station. Martin Rees, President of the Royal Society, said:-
Stephen Hawking has contributed as much as anyone since Einstein to our understanding of gravity. This medal is a fitting recognition of an astonishing research career spanning more than 40 years.
Stephen Hawking is a definitive hero to all of us involved in exploring the Cosmos. His contribution to science is unique and he serves as a continuous inspiration to every thinking person. It was an honour for the crew of the STS-121 mission to fly his medal into space. We think that this is particularly appropriate as Stephen has dedicated his life to thinking about the larger Universe.
This is a very distinguished medal. It was awarded to Darwin, Einstein and Crick.  I am honoured to be in their company.

From some of his scientific beliefs to works he's written, there are a few things you might not have guessed about world-renowned physicist Stephen Hawking.
Even if you don't keep a close eye on new developments in physics, you've probably heard of the renowned physicist Stephen Hawking. He's prided himself on making his complex physical concepts accessible to the public and writing the bestseller, "A Brief History of Time."And if you are a fan of Conan O'Brien, "The Simpsons" or "Star Trek," you might have seen him brandishing his cool wit during guest appearances on those shows.Even if you are familiar with his academic work, however, there are many interesting facts you might not know about Hawking, stretching from his time at school and gradual development of disability to his opinions on the future of the human race.Many find it surprising, for instance, that, despite his influential body of work, Hawking hasn't yet been awarded the Nobel Prize. We'll talk about some of the remarkable distinctions he has received, however.Another interesting fact: Hawking was born on Jan. 8, 1942, which just happened to be the 300th anniversary of Galileo's death.But this has just been the warm-up. Next, we'll delve into some fascinating and unexpected facts about Hawking, including some things about his profoundly inspirational story.

=======================================================
Stephen Hawking was born in Oxford, England on January 8, 1942. He grew up in a highly educated family. Both of his parents had attended Oxford University and his father, Frank, was a medical researcher.
Stephen enjoyed math and science in school where he earned the nickname "Einstein." He wanted to study math at university but Oxford didn't have a math degree at the time so he chose physics and chemistry instead. Stephen found college coursework to be very easy. He enjoyed being a member of the school's boat club as well as classical music. After graduation, he went to Cambridge to study for his PhD.
While Hawking was working on his PhD at Cambridge University, he began to have health issues. His speech became slurred and he became very clumsy, often dropping items or falling for no reason. After going through a series of tests, doctors discovered that Hawking had a disease called ALS (also called Lou Gehrig's disease). At the time, the doctors said he only had a few years to live.
Although Hawking was initially depressed over his diagnosis, he decided that there were things he wanted to accomplish with his life. He began to study and work harder than ever before. He wanted to earn his PhD before he died. Around the same time, he met and fell in love with a girl named Jane Wilde.  Between his work and Jane, Hawking had a reason to live.
Despite the initial grim diagnosis from his doctors, Hawking has lived a full and productive life with the help of science and modern medicine. Although he is confined to a wheelchair and cannot talk, he can communicate using a touch pad computer and a voice synthesizer.
Stephen spent much of his academic work researching black holes and space-time theories. He wrote many important papers on the subject and became a noted expert on relativity and black holes. Perhaps his most famous discovery was when he demonstrated that black holes emit some radiation. Prior to this it was thought that black holes could not get smaller because nothing could escape their enormous gravity. The radiation from black holes has become known as Hawking Radiation.
Stephen also enjoyed writing books. In 1988 he published A Brief History in Time. This book covered modern subjects on cosmology such as the big bang and black holes in terms that could be understood by the average reader. The book became very popular selling millions of copies and remaining on the London Sunday Times best-seller list for four years. He has since written many more books including A Briefer History in Time, On the Shoulders of Giants, and The Universe in a Nutshell.
Hawking has co-written several children's books with his daughter Lucy including George's Cosmic Treasure Hunt and George and the Big Bang.

Hawking's major research is in the areas of theoretical cosmology, focusing on the evolution of the universe as governed by the laws of general relativity. He is most well known for his work in the study of black holes. Among the work that Hawking has been instrumental in developing have included:
At age 21, Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease). Given only three years to live, he confesses that this helped motivate him in his physics work. At the time of this writing, Hawking is 67 years old, which makes him a profound medical miracle and, in my opinion, an example of how drive can motivate longevity, even in the face of ALS.
As part of his condition, Hawking has lost his ability to speak, so he utilizes device that can translate his eye movements (since he can no longer utilize a keypad) to speak in a digitized voice.
For most of his career, Hawking served as the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, a position once held by Sir Isaac Newton. Following a long tradition, Hawking is retiring this position at age 67, in spring of 2009, though he will continue research at the University's cosmology institute. In 2008 he also accepted a position as a visiting researcher at Waterloo, Ontario's Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics.
In addition to a variety of textbooks on the subjects of general relativity and cosmology, Stephen Hawking has written a number of popular books on these subjects:
Stephen Hawking's distinctive appearance, voice, and popularity have caused him to be represented in the popular culture. He's made appearances on the popular television shows The Simpsons, Futurama, as well as a cameo on Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1993 and The Big Bang Theory. Hawking's voice has also been emulated in the creation of a "gangsta rap" style CD by M.C. Hawking: A Brief History of Rhyme.

 Check out our fun facts for kids that feature interesting trivia, quotes and information related to a range  of famous scientists. 
Stephen Hawking is one of the most famous scientists of  modern times. Despite his challenging physical impairments, he has contributed  much to the world of science, helping spread his ideas to the general public  with the release of accessible books such as ‘A Brief History of Time’. Read on for interesting facts, quotes and information about Stephen Hawking.
Hawking has made many important contributions to the fields  of cosmology and quantum gravity. He is also well known for his bestselling  book ‘A Brief History of Time’.
Helped by the success of his book ‘A Brief History of Time’,  Hawking has released other books aimed at making his work accessible to a wide  range of people, these include ‘The Universe in a Nutshell’, ‘A Briefer History  of Time’ and ‘George's Secret Key to the Universe’, a children’s book with a  strong focus on science.
Hawking has worked extensively on the subject of black holes,  providing theories for their behavior, including the idea that they emit  radiation.
Hawking suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a type  of motor neuron disease that has left him almost completely paralyzed.
Some of the awards Hawking has received for his work include  the 1979 Albert Einstein Medal, the Order of the British Empire (Commander) in  1982 and the 1988 Wolf Prize in Physics.
Famous Stephen Hawking quotes include: “There ought to be something very  special about the boundary conditions of the universe and what can be more  special than that there is no boundary?”
“I don't believe that the ultimate theory will come by  steady work along existing lines. We need something new. We can't predict what  that will be or when we will find it because if we knew that, we would have  found it already!”
“For millions of years, mankind lived just like the animals.  Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination. We  learned to talk and we learned to listen.”
“It is a waste of time to be angry about my disability. One  has to get on with life and I haven't done badly. People won't have time for  you if you are always angry or complaining.”
“I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand  years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can  befall life on a single planet. But I'm an optimist. We will reach out to the  stars.”

 "His devilishly complex cosmological theories are handled engagingly in accessible language for the lay reader.… [T]his is a touching portrait that will grace any bookshelf." –Astronomy Now Stephen Hawking is arguably the most famous physicist since Albert Einstein. His decades-long struggle with ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease), combined with his singular brilliance as a cosmologist, has fascinated both the public and his colleagues in science. In this engagingly written biography, Kristine Larsen, a physicist and astronomer herself, presents a candid and insightful portrait of Hawking’s personal and professional life. Avoiding the hero-worship sometimes found in popular works on Hawking, Larsen emphasizes that Hawking is first and foremost a scientist whose work has made significant contributions to our understanding of the nature and origins of the universe. Writing in nontechnical language for the lay reader, Larsen clearly explains Hawking’s complex scientific accomplishments, while telling the story of his challenging life. Topics include Hawking’s early lack of focus as a college student; the impact of ALS on his career and personal life; his groundbreaking work on radiating black holes; his later cutting-edge theories of black holes, cosmology, and the anthropic principle; the amazing publishing success of A Brief History of Time; and his status as a pop icon and spokesperson for the interplay of science and society. Larsen situates Hawking’s sometimes-controversial work within the broader context of scientific peer review and public debate, and discusses his personal life with compassion, respect, and honesty.

       "His devilishly complex cosmological theories are handled  engagingly in accessible language for the lay reader.... [T]his is a  touching portrait that will grace any bookshelf." -- Astronomy Now 
An accessible biography on the life and work of one of the most famous and influential scientists of the last forty years, Stephen Hawking.
  This is a very good book about one of the most brilliant mind of our time.  It is a fascinating insight into Hawking's life.  It is inspirational in that with all he has and is going through personally, he is still a major force in the field of Physics.Very well written.
  Lifts the curtain on Stephen Hawkings life, see his human side, that he's just like everyone else, but, Hawkings is nothing like anyone else. A brilliant mind, seething with a tsunami of knowledge, wisdom, and theory.
4 of 6 people found the following review helpfulFrom Hawking's early lack of focus as a college student to the evolution of his groundbreaking work
  Kristine Larsen's STEPHEN HAWKING: A BIOGRAPHY comes from a physicist and astronomer who examines noted physicist Stephen Hawkins' personal and professional life, emphasizing his contributions, his life, and his special physical challenges. From Hawking's early lack of focus as a college student to the evolution of his groundbreaking work, this biographical coverage is key reading for any interested in correlating his science with his life.
  I enjoyed reading it because I admire Stephen Hawking and love cosmology. Larsen does a good job--as others have mentioned--of explaining some of Hawking's concepts at the same time of writing about his life. I had already heard the usual stories about him but what I did learn from her book was that he traveled much more than I realized and got around a lot more than I had ever thought he did. After reading about his lectures at universities around the world, including America, I felt much better knowing that he had been able to live a semi-normal life for the majority of his years.
  I thought I would be inspired by Stephen Hawking and his genius, but I was not. It has nothing to do with the writing and biography. I just didn't like the person he was, "is", and the conflicting stories and games he played (or someone played) with stories of his death and resurrection.
      The book is well written and easy to read.  It delves into Mr. Hawking's triumphs as well as tragedies.
      This book is well written, and informative.  I enjoyed it.  Only down side is trying to understand the theories that Hawkings and others deal with.  Black holes and the like.
      I don't remember that the description of the book said that the book had several library stamps on the inside front cover and back cover.
      Our members chose not to include this book into our coming selections for the coming year in the Book Club.
      I have read all of Hawkings books but knew little about the man.  He may be the greatest scientist since Einstein, but it is good to read about his personal life as well.
